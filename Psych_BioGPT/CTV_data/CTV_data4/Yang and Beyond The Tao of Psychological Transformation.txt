DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY This takes us on a slightly different tech, I think it's not so much about different therapies or different ways of counseling but rather reflective phase maybe that hopefully we'll hope. As we've learned this morning both from indigenous people and from New Zealand, each culture has a really rich philosophy of the cosmos and how the process of change takes place and I've had the privilege of working with indigenous people and also now working in Hong Kong for a number of years. And the Chinese concepts of cosmology in the Chinese philosophy has really influenced me a lot and enriched my thinking in a lot of ways. So I want to just explore a few ways of how some of the Chinese philosophy can maybe help us to reflect on this whole process of change. 

00:00:55
Change and Transformation 

00:00:55
Psychotherapy is the process of interpersonal 

00:00:55
and intrapsychic change (Suler, 1993, p. 

00:00:55
212) 

00:00:55
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY  Because as we all know, psychotherapy is a process of interpersonal and intrapsychic change. And within the concepts of the Chinese concept of Yin and Yang and Tai Ji, we actually find the embodiment of transformation and change and the whole development of the Chinese philosophy not just Confucian philosophy, it's premised on the fundamental understanding of the human being as a paradigm of ultimate reality and potential creativity and the crucial thing about the development is to realize that the truth of the being and becoming of the human person and to fulfill this truth by continuous practice of self-cultivation and self-development, which is very strong in Confucian philosophy. And the idea of change and transformation is cyclical and dynamic, it's not static. 

00:01:55
Change is like heaven and earth 

00:01:55
Remember 

00:01:55
The changes and transformations of Heaven 

00:01:55
Are in the symbols of Change. 

00:01:55
The changes and transformations of Earth 

00:01:55
Are in the forms of Change 

00:01:55
Everything is seen clearly in Change 

00:01:55
(from the Ta Chuan - The Great treatise) 

00:01:55
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY The only reality in the whole notion of Yin and Yang is changed. And the only reality reno is changed, nothing remains static. And that's fundamentally in Chinese thought and in the movement of the Tai Ji. The Chinese language is highly ideographic and the images portrayed the complexity of variable and simultaneity of patterns that occur in nature and it takes a lot of the patterns of nature to show the dynamics of change. And closely associated with this image is the oracle of the I Ching or the Book of Changes as they call it, the I Ching or I Ching, the Book of Changes. And the world view that's expressed in this Book of Changes and embedded in the I Ching is very different from the linear and causative perspectives that the west tends to -- having -- its thinking so strongly. And the I Ching looks its secularity and rhythms of secularity, not just one -- rhythms of secularity and the fact that there is an interrelatedness in or change. And if this aspect of dynamic secularity, that can bring powerful insights into psychotherapy and counseling. 

00:03:15
Tai Ji -- Symbol of change 

00:03:15
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY Almost circularity and linearity are opposite, they also complement each other, they can't live one without the other. So the I Ching comes out of ancient Taoism and over 4000 years ago the Tai Ji system was created but it's constantly evolved, it's not something that was created each century, and each emperor and each group of people tried to work with it and evolve it and develop the ideas, it's very complex and this know where I can give you more than just maybe a little bite and tempt you to maybe explore some of move yourselves. 

00:04:00
The Tai Ji System 

00:04:00
Two opposing balances are the YIN and the 

00:04:00
YANG 

00:04:00
'which are understood as rest/motion, 

00:04:00
darkness/brightness, invisibility/visibility, and 

00:04:00
softness/firmness, closedness/openness, 

00:04:00
retrospective/prospective propensities, and 

00:04:00
other such properties' (Cheng, 2006, p. 328) 

00:04:00
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY And the two opposing balances within the Tai Ji system are the Yin and the Yang, which are understood as rest and motion, darkness and light, invisibility and visibility, closedness/openness, softness/firmness, retrospective and prospective propensities and other properties like that. And author Cheng highlights the changes and the constant and continuous regeneration of things in reality, what reality is made up of. Each cause of thing has two sides, Yin and Yang, which pertains to the stationary state of existence and its receptivity to the outside world. And the Yang, which pertains to its dynamic state of developing its propensities in its interaction with the outside world. In the Book of Changes, the Tai Ji system as a trigrams positioned around it and we'll have a look at those in a minute. A naive represent possible combinations of the Yin and the Yang lines. Suler, who has done a quiet a lot of study on these Yang, Suler, sees value and looking at the complete system and then applying it to Western psychotherapy, because he say it is office concrete practical information about the social and psychological processes that we're going through, the Yin and the Yang. 

00:05:30
... psychotherapy, as a distinct process of 

00:05:30
interpersonal and intrapsychic change, falls 

00:05:30
within the realm of the Tao, the archetype of 

00:05:30
all processes of change, which is expressed in 

00:05:30
the imagery of the Tai Chi... 

00:05:30
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY Psychotherapy, as a distinct process of interpersonal and intrapsychic change, falls within the realm of the Tao, the archetype of all the processes of change, which is expressed in the imagery of the Tai Chi. 

00:05:45
The imagery of the Tai Chi figure and its 

00:05:45
eight trigrams can encompass the various 

00:05:45
microcosmic and macrocosmic aspects of 

00:05:45
change that occur within minutes or years in 

00:05:45
the course of psychotherapy. 

00:05:45
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY The imagery of the Tai Chi figure and its eight trigrams can encompass the various microcosmic and macrocosmic aspects of change that occurs throughout the minutes and the years of psychotherapy or counseling that we undergo. 

00:06:05
It embodies the process of attaining insight, 

00:06:05
the transitions in emotional states, and the 

00:06:05
metamorphosis of the self. It applies to the 

00:06:05
experiences of both the patient and the 

00:06:05
clinician, and to the various transformations 

00:06:05
of the relationship between patient and 

00:06:05
clinician (Suler, 1993, p.212). 

00:06:05
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY It embodies the process of attaining insight, the transitions in emotional states, and the metamorphosis of the self, the changes that take place. It applies to the experiences of both the patient and the therapist, and to the various transformations of the relationship that take place between both the client and ourselves. The client, anyone who changes, we also change. And again it's imperative to remember that these old Tai Ji system is just part of a much broader and philosophical system of Taoism. 

00:06:40
... it is somewhat like an alchemical container 

00:06:40
for the processes of psychotherapy, because 

00:06:40
in itself is constantly changing and can 

00:06:40
therefore meet the differing needs of clients at 

00:06:40
different stages of the psychotherapy process. 

00:06:40
Because it is complex and ambiguous, it 

00:06:40
mirrors psychotherapy which also is 

00:06:40
ambiguous. 

00:06:40
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY And at the same time, it's somewhat like an alchemical container for the process of psychotherapy, sometimes when I worked from the Yin Yang background with clients, I will talk about the space being the sacred space and show them the image of the alchemical container and how we took this raw material and how we worked with it and that -- I also have to be really careful, not to rush, not to go too fast, not to go too slow but to be really there with the client in that process of change. And they also had to take that time because it's a complex and ambiguous process and psychotherapy is also ambiguous in many ways. We have to live with the uncertainty, the not knowing stance of what's happening and where the client is going. And so it's very important that we live with this art of ambiguity and learn to be there and be patient with ourselves and with the client. 

00:07:35
Drawing the Tai ji is a process of locating 

00:07:35
centers and halving 

00:07:35
Circles within circles, spaces 

00:07:35
within spaces and transitions 

00:07:35
within transitions... 

00:07:35
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY  So to create the image of the Tai Ji, it starts with an empty circle and when we go into the process of psychotherapy we start with this emptiness because we don't know what's there and we need to create that empty space within ourselves. And if you draw the image of the Tai Ji, it's a process of locating centers and circles. Suler says that psychotherapy is a process of locating centers and halving the active dichotomizing, discriminating between the pros and the cons, identifying opposite feelings and revealing the polarities in personality structure. But the psychotherapeutic process also involves locating centers. When we look again at the image of the Tai Ji, we see there is circles within circles and spaces within spaces and first of all the image looks like two fish dancing around each other and that's a little bit of the symbolic of the relationship between the therapist and the client. The Tai Ji image is from the Wu Ji, which is the empty circle but also contains that empty circle within it and that's like an Island of pregnant stillness waiting to be actualized, it's like the unexplored territory that we're waiting to bring out into the open. 

00:09:00
Only the man who crosses the river at night 

00:09:00
knows the value of the light of day 

00:09:00
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY There is an ancient proverb in Chinese, ancient Chinese proverb that says, only the man who knows the river at night knows the value of the light of day and this is where the opposite, it's so important to you can't know grief unless you know enjoying, you can't know dark unless you know light. So in depicting the lights and dark within each other the Tai Ji' s image symbolizes the light and dark within each of us, knowing oneself involves accepting that light in that dark within us. And it's possible to have too much Yin within us or too much Yang within us. Also we made alternate between one and the other in conjunction with different situations that are happening. 

00:09:45
'Balance and health result when both 

00:09:45
elements are present in opposition. An 

00:09:45
individual needs to be able to move, but also 

00:09:45
benefits from quiet' (Steinberg & Whiteside, 

00:09:45
1999, p.37). 

00:09:45
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY And balance and health result when both elements are present in opposition and we have to be able to move from one to the other and also be able to benefit from the quiet and the stillness. Yin and Yang are opposites but they’re complementary. And if we look at nature, we can see this in natural progression from dark to light. And from the cold winter to the warmth of summer and then to the cooling of autumn. The transformation of one aspect takes place whenever the Yin or Yang has reached its peak. And it's funny living in Hong Kong in a very hybrid active city where this transformation from day to night. Is not really obvious anymore, particularly if you're in the middle of somewhere like Cosmo Bay are one of the central parts of Hong Kong. We deny to sleep with such bright lights and the shops are open till almost midnight And longer health is stillness of night. And even when you do put your lights out at night, you have to close the curtains to create the dark, because outside the light is so bright. And you don't have that sense of the stillness of night, you still have the roar of the traffic. 

00:11:00
In the Book of Changes life experience is a 

00:11:00
succession of yin and yang phases. In other 

00:11:00
words everything in life finds its way to their 

00:11:00
opposite, order succeeds disorder and so on 

00:11:00
again similar to the cycle of nature 

00:11:00
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY In the Book of Changes, life experiences a succession of Yin and Yang phases. And in other words everything in life finds its way to the opposite, order succeeds disorder and so on. And psychotherapy is this open flow of Yin and Yang. Both interdependence and consecution embeddedness are intricately intertwined. And as I said a modern society often tries to do way with the negative. If I -- there are no Beijing supporters here I hope, we just look at the papers and in Beijing at the moment or in Central China, if someone speaks up against something that’s against human rights or against human justice, they’re immediately taken away and silenced and put in jail. All the way the activist anyone who speaks out about justice suddenly they disappear and they’re silenced. And then I was sort of thinking also of South America some years ago where people were killed if they spoke up against the injustice, that's being done. And that continues in many different ways where people don’t want to face the negative and the dark that’s within us. So if we then turn to the trigrams, just a little look it’s not that easy to see up there, but we have a whole of different images around the Tai Ji that highlight either the Yin or the Yang. And over the years as that developed, they also developed since of the seasons and the changes in order to help understand what this process of change is all about. And in one sense some of these trigram images it rather like yung's image, archetypal images, ancient images that are archetypal. And the context of an image and its attributes, a form if you like a transformational space for change, a space within. And the eight trigrams Sun which is wind, K'an which is water, Ken mountain, Kin earth, Chen thunder, Li fire T'ui lake and Chien heaven. And as the dynasties changed, what the dynasties changed in China sorted some of these trigrams change and developed more. And it’s just an interesting history to see. But let’s move on a little bit to some of the trigrams, because what you have as they developed more, they also put a universal cycle around it. And the universal compass if you like, looking at the cycle of Yin and Yang the yearly and the daily solar cycles, and the quadrant of the four dimensions and then they brought in the five transformative moments. 

00:13:50
Five Transformative Moments 

00:13:50
Woody Moment 

00:13:50
organic growth- the 

00:13:50
client seeking change 

00:13:50
Fiery moment: upward 

00:13:50
And cleansing- 

00:13:50
commitment and 

00:13:50
growth through the 

00:13:50
cleansing process 

00:13:50
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY And here they changed from looking at elements, rather to seeing these elements is transformative moments, which I found very useful thing. And so as moments they embrace natural and social processes. And when we see the eight trigrams in the psychological context, a rich and full understanding of change can be seen. 

00:14:15
Spring represents the green season, a time 

00:14:15
of beginnings and it is in the East where the 

00:14:15
sun rises and causes things to emerge from 

00:14:15
the ground. The South is associated with 

00:14:15
‘growing’ and summer. What has been 

00:14:15
planted in the spring now matures. 

00:14:15
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY So spring represents the green season, comes from the East with the sun rises and causes things to emerge from the ground. Think of that in terms of psychotherapy, the South is associated with growing in summer. What has been planted in the spring now matures. And you can see that within the person. 

00:14:35
Autumn is associated 

00:14:35
with ‘harvesting’ and is 

00:14:35
in the West where the 

00:14:35
sunsets. What has 

00:14:35
matured and ripened 

00:14:35
is now harvested. Finally, 

00:14:35
‘trial’ represents Winter 

00:14:35
and is in the north and 

00:14:35
midnight 

00:14:35
it makes a division 

00:14:35
between what 

00:14:35
survives the winter and 

00:14:35
what the case and 

00:14:35
perishes 

00:14:35
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY Autumn is associated with harvest, and in the West where the sunsets. And what is matured and ripened is now harvested. And finally, trial represents winter, and is in the North in the midnight. And it makes a division between what survives the winter and what has to be let go off, what has yet to came, what has to perish? 

00:15:00
Five Transformative Moments 

00:15:00
Woody Moment: 

00:15:00
organic growth-the 

00:15:00
client seeking change. 

00:15:00
Fiery moment: upward 

00:15:00
and cleansing- 

00:15:00
commitment and growth 

00:15:00
through the 

00:15:00
cleansing process. 

00:15:00
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY And if we look at a little bit more at the five transformative movements, the seasons or natures cycles of the Yin and Yang cycles all interlock. And these not a substances, but processes or moments of -- or processes and again in the commentary to the article we have the best article, we have the best description. Because the woody moment is organic growth and associated with spring and it has attributes of bending and straightening and what can be a woody moment in the process of counseling with psychotherapy. Possibly when the client first comes in and seeks growth or resolution who wants to find an answer to the problem. And wood is used to make fire, so fiery moment follows and its related to summer and fire is upward and cleansing and the flame remains join to the wood and gradually turns to ashes. 

00:15:55
Ashes lead to the 

00:15:55
Earthy moment-the 

00:15:55
support of all the other 

00:15:55
moments-penetrating 

00:15:55
more deeply, holding 

00:15:55
on to nurturing seeds- 

00:15:55
mining for the gold 

00:15:55
within. 

00:15:55
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY And Ashes then lead into an Earth moment and in this Tai Chi, the Earthy moment seeks some what's called the pivot of equalization, which is a balance between heaven and earth. And you have to have heaven and earth together, you can't have one without the other. And it's not a balance that we often talk about balances being holding one's balance really tired. Balance is a dynamic movement of holding the attention of the opposites; it's not about standing still in one spot. So, this is about bringing forth sowing and holding and in psychotherapy it's about maybe going more deeply about penetrating more deeply into understanding, mining the gold, if you like within a person and holding on to nurturing the seeds that have been planted in the heart, mind. 

00:16:50
The Metallic Moment- 

00:16:50
autumn, the West and 

00:16:50
sunset-consolidation 

00:16:50
and restraint- 

00:16:50
strengthening 

00:16:50
awareness and 

00:16:50
consciousness 

00:16:50
The Streaming 

00:16:50
moment - water - 

00:16:50
irrigation - causing 

00:16:50
wood to grow and 

00:16:50
starting a new cycle. 

00:16:50
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY And bringing forth minerals from the earth lead to the Metallic Moment, which is associated with autumn again, and the West, and the Sunset. And this the time in Psychotherapy for consolidating for gaining more awareness, more consciousness, more understanding and when you melt the metallic moment and it's liquefied, it's gives forth to a streaming moment which is associated with winter and the north and mid-night. And talks about fluidity, and growth can't take place unless this irrigation, unless this water, unless this fluid. 

00:17:30
It is a holistic vehicle for understanding 

00:17:30
change and transformation and it takes one 

00:17:30
away from too much verbiage or too much 

00:17:30
thinking, allowing both therapist and client to 

00:17:30
work in the transitional spaces. 

00:17:30
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY So when we look at these rich images that become if you're like a holistic vehicle for understanding change and transformation and it takes one away from too much verbiage in the counseling zone or too much thinking and allowing for the therapist and the client to work in transitional spaces. The Tai Chi, serves as an intermediate zone, somewhere between the objective and the subjective where reality and imagination into mix. And where you playfully shake the extensively given elements according to one’s own ideas and wishes and that in turn you shaped by those assigned elements. If you're able to reflect on your own transformative moments then we're able to explore with the clients where they're, within their moments and I hope them within the process. But again to remember that the interpretation are very complex and we can't interpret for the client, we can only know our own, but somehow hope the client to then gaining sight into their own process. An authomerit(ph) uses the tri-grand images with his clients in a clinical setting and he said it's really revealing, how the clients can create their own images. So, if you then begin to look at -- about I jumped ahead bit -- 

00:18:55
The alchemist, in his or 

00:18:55
her task of 

00:18:55
transforming metal to 

00:18:55
gold, had to place it in 

00:18:55
a special container. 

00:18:55
Too much wind or too 

00:18:55
little wind would destroy the process; 

00:18:55
too fast or too slow 

00:18:55
would also hinder the 

00:18:55
process. 

00:18:55
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY The alchemist who transforms metal into gold, too much wind or too little wind would destroy the process. And if you go too fast or too slow you can destroy the process. Like to remember when I was a very young counselor and the client said to me, you not trying to understand me, and I thought, I've understood so I talked about this in supervision and the supervisor said no you didn't understand, you didn't listen. She said you went too fast. So my intuition jumped ahead where I knew the client needed to go, I thought the client needed to go, and I was pushing too fast, that was a big learning for me to learn to sit back and allow the client to be in their own space, in their own time. And these images are very good and remaining of that. 

00:19:45
'In Taoist alchemy, it is not metals that are 

00:19:45
refined, but the body and mind of the 

00:19:45
alchemist. Renewed by the harmonious 

00:19:45
vapors of yin and yang, and transformed by 

00:19:45
fire and water, the alchemist emerges from 

00:19:45
the cauldron reconnected to the primordial 

00:19:45
life-energy of the Tao' (Wong, 1997, p.66). 

00:19:45
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY Kao Lun(ph) from the notion of Taoist alchemy, the psychological transmission tool. 

00:19:50
For example, SUN(wind) is also known as 

00:19:50
'The Gentle' with attributes of penetrating, 

00:19:50
gradual, honest, and simple. The 

00:19:50
penetrating is gentle and gradual. 

00:19:50
'Sometimes the most effective interventions 

00:19:50
in psychotherapy are those that are subtle 

00:19:50
and gradual like a gently penetrating wind' 

00:19:50
(Suler, 1993, p.222). 

00:19:50
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY So, if you look at SUN which is about the attributes of the gentle and the penetrating symbol attributes and sometimes in psychotherapy its first attitudes that are very gradual subtle and penetrating. The alchemist, I got to behind, I am sorry, I miss. 

00:20:10
KAN (water) - 

00:20:10
attributes of depth, 

00:20:10
mystery, even danger 

00:20:10
and anxiety 

00:20:10
Learn to flow gently 

00:20:10
like water seeping in to 

00:20:10
the nooks and 

00:20:10
crannies of the 

00:20:10
unconscious 

00:20:10
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY So then KAN, which is about water and depth and mystery and even danger and anxiety. And when the clients confronting maybe the death if they're unconscious, so the dark side and itself. If they can learn to flow like water and gently explore the nooks and the crannies where the water is seeping then moment becomes possible. And even one tiny moment is important and we have to be aware with each little step. 

00:20:40
Be still like a mountain 

00:20:40
- KEN 

00:20:40
Calmness, resting, 

00:20:40
inner stillness 

00:20:40
Giving validity to the 

00:20:40
yin, the dark and the 

00:20:40
passive 

00:20:40
Stillness often 

00:20:40
represents the 

00:20:40
beginning of change 

00:20:40
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY Be still like a mountain is the message you can, Calmness, resting, inner stillness important. In looking at Dan Diaz divine comedian, Helen Luke, he was a union analyst, did a lot of work with Dan Diaz divine comedy and when he came to poetry, he had to spend equal time moving and resting and if he didn't take the time for resting, you would regress or go backwards. And I think that's an important concept even for ourselves that we're constantly moving we don't take that time to balance our life between movement and rest, we go backwards. And the stillness often represents a moment of change or the beginning of the change. 

00:21:20
Stillness leads to K'UN - the earth - the 

00:21:20
receptive one - the height of YIN. 

00:21:20
Must be balanced with heaven: CH'IEN 

00:21:20
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY And the stillness leads to KUN, the earth which is known as the receptive, the attributes of YIN or the height of YIN. However the CH'IEN places the earth in a position, where it needs to be balance with its opposite heaven that don't have heaven without earth, and heaven is the creative. 

00:21:35
Ch'ien - the Creative, also Arousing 

00:21:35
Moments of creativity or moments or

eruptions 

00:21:35
Lead with stillness 

00:21:35
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY And the earth is the womb, it gives birth to new life and nourishes and allows growth to spring forth and as a therapist, we need to learn and listen and be patient. And then the trigram of Ch'ien is also known as thunder or the arousing and it's like those moments sometimes when under pressure moments just break forth and it's a cathartic time, it might lead to panic or confusion. But if we allow to happen and learn to come back to the stillness sometimes. When the storm -- till the storm has passed, we can then move on.

Follow up with

00:22:10
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY And then Li, which is known as fire is also about clarity, it's about understanding, it's about insight and intelligence. Water reaches down, fire reaches up and it's that "ah-ha!" moment in psychotherapy. And we also need clarity of mind as we working with the client.

00:22:30
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY And then finally we move to Lake, the Joyous which is fullness and satisfaction, expansiveness and openness. And we have to open our hearts and hold sacred what he shared. The creative is already interlocked with the earth, so you got that dynamic balance. Robert Johnson, when he write his life story, Robert Johnson's Willing to his late 80s now union analyst and his life story was balancing heaven and earth. And his e-mail was a slender thread is really, lovely balancing heaven and earth. There is time and season for everything. One final point, we have a few minutes left still, if you look at the concept of Chi Kung because Chi is part of this. 

00:23:10
Qi-Chi 

00:23:10
Nourishing vapor, moistening mist 

00:23:10
Everything in the universe is qi-in 

00:23:10
perpetual motion, in constant change 

00:23:10
Exhaling through the mouth while exercising the breath, 

00:23:10
Spitting out the old breaths, drawing in the new, 

00:23:10
Moving like the bear, stretching like the bird, 

00:23:10
This is simply the art of longevity! - 

00:23:10
And the aim of those scholars who practice dao-yin 

00:23:10
(Ch,15 (in Cohen, p.17) 

00:23:10
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY An another asemic in Chinese Cosmology closely associated with them yin and yang, is this Chi, the fundamental energy of the universe the life force that sustains the universe, similar to the dynamics, it's seeks to be nurtured and balanced. And the Chi ideogram has a strong metaphysical, spiritual and psychological connections in it. And the three lines of the top main stream or vapor. The character of a rice is on the bottom, so it represents the steam or the vapor coming from the bowstring rice is the source of life and it's very important actually in the ideogram you got rice and you got steam and water and how does that relate then to the Chi and the energy within us. The Chi became to stand as the ontological basis for all things. Chi is everything in the universe is Chi perpetual motion, constant change, constant alteration, again the idea of change and alteration but interconnected into an organic and Chi is also divided into Yin and Yang and it's opposite and they complement each other so we strengthen Yang and Yin weakens, but when Yin grows Yang declines, so that we move easily from one to the other. And this is very opposite to a dualistic thinking in Western thinking. It's a dynamic balance and you're not trying to get rid of one or the other, you're trying to develop them both. And according to Chinese medicine, Chi is both external and internal, so it's out here, I feel there's enormous energy among all of you here, it's -- it energizes me up here. But we have it inside us too, and we have our genetic Chi, inherited from our parents, but we can also develop the Chi that we grow and protect and absorb through meditation that we've heard a lot about through exercise, through healthy diet. I am sure you heard of Jon Kabat-Zinn, the Buddhist psychotherapist who endures the science of mindfulness in psychotherapy. And working with Chi is called Chi Kung, and it's also a form of self compassion and mindfulness. And (inaudible ) numerous evidence based researches that mindful in a way of therapist is more able to mediate empathy and improve the therapeutic relationship and this get by research neurobiology, which we heard over the last few days. And similarly studies and the practice that using Chi Kung and in training of psychotherapist have similar results. Um, Cohen sites one of Kao Lun's disciple saying exhaling through the mouth while exercising the breath, spitting out the old breaths, drawing in the new, moving like the bear, stretching like the bird, this is simply the art of longevity, and the aim of those scholars who also practice dao-yin by Chi. By cultivating Chi, the mind and the heart of Chi become receptive and open to the possibility and means of change. In Chinese the word for mind and heart is Xin, XIN, there is no separate word for mind and heart. And the Xin translates his heart, mind through the practice of Chi Kung mind and heart are integrated and what is known as the Heart-Mind Elixir and stress and cognitive distortions are healed. And the health improves, let me just come back sorry.

Health, well-being, and long life can only be achieved by 

00:26:50
remaining centered with one's spirit, 

00:26:50
guarding against squandering ones's Qi, 

00:26:50
using breath and movement 

00:26:50
to maintain the free flow of Qi and blood, 

00:26:50
aligning with the natural forces of the seasons, 

00:26:50
and cultivating the tranquil heart and mind, (In Jahnke, 

00:26:50
2002.p. 75) 

00:26:50
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY The health improves classic book of medicine said health well-being and long life can only be achieved by remaining centered within one spirit, guarding against squandering ones's Qi using breath and movement to maintain the free flow of Qi and blood, aligning with the natural forces of the seasons and cultivating the tranquil heart and mind. So just in conclusion psychotherapy and counseling are about hoping to change transformation and growth both intrapsychically and behaviorally, interpersonally. The process is ongoing not just for the client but also for us, and the powerful image of the Tai Chi and the Yin and Yang and the Trigrams, can be apply to psychotherapeutic theory and take on a variety of meanings in different cases. Understanding this complementary within our lives and the moment from season-to-season and from day-to-day and day and night is all symbolized in this rich Chinese Cosmology.

Change is a book you cannot push away. 

00:27:45
Its way is always shifting. 

00:27:45
Transforming and moving, never resting, 

00:27:45
It flows through the six empty places, 

00:27:45
Rising and falling, never fixed, strong and supple 

00:27:45
transform each other. 

00:27:45
Rules cannot confine this, for it follows only. 

00:27:45
Change. 

00:27:45
DR ANN MOIR-BUSSY There is a strong remainder in a book about the Tai-Chi, change is a book, you cannot push away, its way is always shifting. Transforming and moving, never resting, It flows through the six empty places, Rising and falling, never fixed, strong and supple, transform each other. Rules cannot confine this, for it follows only change. It enters and leaves in a rhythm, it teaches caution coming in and going out. A psychotherapist if we can allow the images in the words to move our hear, mind and to shape by them. Then we can also create a transformational space the clients to embrace the opposites within and around them. And to become fluid, within the psycho pattern of change and growth.
