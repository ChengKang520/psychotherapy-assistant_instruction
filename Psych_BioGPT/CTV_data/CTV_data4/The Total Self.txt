THINKING ALLOWED with Jeffrey Mishlove 

00:00:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome. I'm Jeffrey Mishlove. Our topic today is understanding our total self. Do we have a forgotten heritage of the mind? Have we lost track or even disowned parts of our own being? With me today is Dr. Hale Stone, author, lecturer, and therapist. Dr. Stone has written,"Embracing Heaven and Earth". His wife, Dr. Cedra Winkleman, has authored, "Embracing Our Selves and Embracing Each Other." He and his wife has also developed a therapeutic process known as the Voice Dialogue Technique. Welcome Hal. 

00:01:05
HAL STONE Hello. Good to be here. 

00:01:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's a pleasure to be with you. You know, I remember when I was an undergraduate psychologist student, uh, the diagnosis multiple personalities, "three faces of Eve", and so on. And these were thought of very rare and extremely fascinating conditions. Uh, rather obscure. Now today it seems as if we're developing a whole new view of, of the multiplicity of personalities within us. 

00:01:35
HAL STONE, PhD Co-author, Embracing Our Selves 

00:01:35
HAL STONE Technically speaking the term multiple personality still is thought of in psychiatry as condition of abnormality. Um, they're dealing with essentially with um, uh, reality of the psyche. The psyche is made up of very, very different um, personalities. They're called by different names by different people. Some people will call them sub-personalities, subs. Yule used to call them complexes, different selves. uh, Doug Jeff called the, the eyes of the personality. Uh, my wife and I refer to them as uh, as selves or energy patterns. Because they are that also. So, the question is what's the difference between um, the abnormality of multiple personalities and what we have discovered to be the reality. Which is we all have multiple personalities. What makes it abnormal? It becomes abnormal when there is no one around to say, oh that's[00:002:35] and interesting part of me, you see. So, if some part of me takes over in a certain moment and says something, I have a reflective capability. I can say,"God, that was interesting. Where did that come from." But the true multiple personality doesn't have that part of him that reflective agent that can say that's a part. In fact, uh, um, uh, a friend of my wife, whose a psychologist and therapist has a woman call her three different times one evening with three different voices. And the woman had no connection at all to the fact that she had done that. Literally, the three took over. That's the abnormal condition. 

00:03:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And that's the classical abnormal multiple personality condition. One personality often has no idea what the other are doing. 

00:03:20
HAL STONE Absolutely. 

00:03:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It sort of goes unconscious. 

00:03:20
HAL STONE Well, that's not very much unlike what happens to us adults. We just uh, most of us have a uh, what I would call a fantasy. That we are very much in charge of our lives and making free choices and exercising free will. When you begin to work with these sub-personalities, you begin to discover that, that isn't the case at all. Uh, the reality as we see it, is that, I, I hate to say all of us but I have to say it because that's what I believe. We are all identified with certain selves. Now, in a way that's inevitable. You grow up in the world you can't be everything. So if you grow up in a family, and the family is rational then you are either going to identify with being a rational person or you're going to push off and go to the other side and be an irrational person, or an imaginative, or an intuitive person. That can happen also. But we're going to identify with certain parts. And we're also going to push off with other parts. So if I grow up in a family where I identify with my rationality automatically that means that I'm going to disown certain other parts. I'm going to disown my intuition, I'm going to disown my imagination. If I grow up identified with being a powerful person because that's what my father wants. Then I'm going to disown my vulnerability, I won't be able to show weakness. I won't be able to show neediness in my relationships, you see. So, for every part that we identify with uh, we have on the other side a system of selves that we call disown selves. And every one of us then is in this condition of being identified with primary selves and disowning other parts. 

00:05:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And typically, I suppose we identify with parts of ourselves that are consistent with what we admire in ourselves. I would identify with being uh, likable, with uh, being competent. These, these sort of things. 

00:05:20
HAL STONE Because that, if those are the values of the prevailing culture. If you grow up in a culture which uh, uh, fighting and beating people up is the value then that becomes the primary self. And then uh, uh, and you know, being nice becomes a disown self. So it depends on the family, the culture, the historical time. And even in one's life these selves can change. For example, in the consciousness movement many of us start out as quite conservative. Identifying very much with a sort of contracted values. And then uh, in the course of our psychological and spiritual work we change our primary selves. And pretty soon, our primary self is the one that says, "You should be more expanded, you should be expressive, you should be more sexual. You should meditate more. Expansion, uh, becomes the primary self rather than contraction being the primary self. So, in one's life it can shift many different times. 

00:06:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And, and I gather that typically we begin to distant, disown, or push away from our consciousness parts of ourselves that are not valued by the culture. Maybe uh, what we might think of as ugly or horrible, extremely uh, aggressive, or dishonest. 

00:06:30
HAL STONE Well, the, the selves that are disowned are the selves that the primary system doesn't want around. In, in our culture uh, they tend to be um, for men vulnerability is a very, very big one. Also another uh, system that is also disowned are great deal are the uh, instinctual energies. 

00:06:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words, inside of every great big bully there's a sissy waiting to come out. 

00:06:55
HAL STONE Oh, there's no question about that. 

00:06:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:06:55
HAL STONE These opposites are always there. So the disown instinctual energy is which we call manic energy they tend to be very disowned. In women until the women's movement power was disowned. Women were uh, trained to be loving daughters essentially to please the man, and mothers to please the man. And uh, they had, they had begun to embrace their power side. Um, as they move out of that particular uh, system of selves that they were identified with. 

00:07:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Now you've used two words here, embrace and disown. Can we amplify that a bit. 

00:07:30
HAL STONE Well, the way we think about uh, the evolution, the personality, the first thing we have to discover is that these selves exist inside of us. Uh, they're very real. They're very antonymous. Um, the problem is. 

00:07:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE As if they were spirits or energies of their own. 

00:07:50
HAL STONE, PhD Co-author, Embracing Our Selves 

00:07:50
HAL STONE If we lived in the Middle Ages we would have language that's much more accurate. The Middle Ages, they talked about spirit possession. Literally when these, when these sub-personalities take over, we're in a spirit possession. But we're too sophisticated in these days to talk about it. The thesis of our work is essentially very simple. We have to become aware of all the selves, we have to learn to embrace all the selves. That doesn't mean becoming them. It means embracing them. So, if for example, I am identified with being a nice guy. He's sitting over here next to me let's say. And that's my prevailing way of operating in life. I'm a nice guy, I like people. I want to please you, I want the audience to enjoy what I'm saying. I don't want you to be unhappy with me. Okay. Over here there is a very different person. Over here is somebody who says, I don't care what people think. If they like you they like you, if they don't they don't. Jeff really likes you, what's the difference. Just be yourself. Say it like it is. This guy says, hey wait a minute if, if I say everything like it is and I share every reaction, you know, I can end up with all enemies. Who needs that. This guy says, if you don't say it like it is and you don't express yourself you end up with a heart attack. And you see these characters are at war with us. It's like, it's like a car that's being driven by 20 different people. The primary selves are always fighting to be in charge of who drives the car. So if being a nice guy is primary that part of you always wants to be in charge. It's afraid of the nice guy. So, embracing the selves means that you have to find out what are your primary selves. See if you're raised as a nice guy, how do you know that. How do you know that's a primary self. How do you know that you're disowning your not nice guy. Well, there's a very simply way of finding out. Who can't you understand. What kind of people push your buttons? What kind of people annoy you, irritate you? What kind of people do you judge? There you have the direct picture of your own disown selves. I mean it's literally that simple. 

00:09:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PhD 

00:09:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Typically though a person might say well, that's not me. I mean I can't stand that, how could that possibly me. 

00:10:05
HAL STONE That let's you know what a good disown self it is. 

00:10:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:10:05
HAL STONE See, this is a normal, we're not talking about an abnormal condition. Everyone has selves, everyone has to be identified with primary selves. There's no way not too. And consciousness means separating from that and learning what's disowned. Let's say a woman for example, uh, is identified with being a mother, she has three children. Okay. So, she's identified with being a mother. And on her other side there's a part of her that hates mothering but she knows nothing about it. Okay. The kind of woman that makes her the most comfortable is a woman who is very uncaring. A woman who is very cold, like a business woman. Whenever she meets a business woman she gets very irritated with that person. Why does she get irritated? Why does she have to judge that kind of person? Because her unloving self is disowned. The part of her that doesn't really enjoy children, that never wanted to have them in the first place was disowned. Automatically what happens then is life brings you whatever it is that you disown. 

00:11:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE What, what about the case of a great, like a saint, a Mother Theresa, spends her whole life caring for the sick and the dying, you think inside of her there is somebody who hates it. Who, who really would just assume uh, go and murder people herself or. 

00:11:25
HAL STONE Well I don't know what's going on with Mother Theresa but uh, I would be willing to give very fairly odds that she has a considerable sense of knowledges that are operating in her. It may be that in this particular incarnation and this particular life process that she's in her particular task is to live exactly what she's living. I don't judge that in any way. But I'm no longer naive enough to believe that she doesn't have the other side in here. I haven't spent 30 years uh, working with people and I, I don't have a lot of native about these things. I don't happen to judge that. The fact that I have in me a lot of conscious selves doesn't disturb me. I'm very, I just know that they're there. And my task in life is to discover as many of them as I can. The reason that it's very important to discover these opposites you see, is that only then do I have any choice. For example, if I um, am writing a book and I only have my rational linear mind available to me. That doesn't give me a lot of choice about what I write, the ideas that come to me. If you make me aware of my intuition and my fantasy life and I can separate from that my mind, okay. Now, I have a wonderful situation. I have my mind over here and over here I have my intuition and my fantasy life. I am now able to embrace both of these, okay. I embrace both with out being identified with either one. That makes life more uncomfortable, you see. If I'm the woman who has three children, I now separate from the mother and I now have awareness. I now have an ego that is aware. I embrace the part of me that loves children and I also embrace the part of me that doesn't like children, that never wanted children. Okay. What this results is, is sweat, and my personal fantasy about God. Is that God loves sweat. God loves people who are able to embrace opposites. It makes life more difficult. It makes life more complicated, decisions aren't so easy. But at least they come from a place in us that's born of knowing opposites. 

00:13:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But in this multiplicity of opposites that seems to be the psyche and one might even think of it as larger than that. A zoological garden of all types of, of inner creatures of, of the mind and all of that multiplicity. Where are you, where is self. 

00:14:05
HAL STONE Well, I can tell you what we think about that, okay. Because everybody has their own way of looking at that. Awareness, when we think of consciousness we think about it as operating three different levels. Awareness gives me the ability to witness whatever is going on. It's a wonderful gift. As you well know. It means that if I have awareness I don't have to be identified with anything I'm saying. So even as I communicate these ideas to you my awareness witnesses. And a part of me doesn't have to be identified with what I'm saying. Awareness gives me the gift of not being attached to what I'm saying. It's a wonderful thing. But awareness isn't enough because if you're just aware you don't experience anything. So the second level of the definition is experience. The experience of all this multiplicity you've just talked about. We are an unbelievably array of energies. I mean it's awesome what's inside of us. So, the second of the consciousness is experiencing these different parts. I may not be able to do all of them this time around but I do the best I can. And that's the journey that all of us sharing because every kind of consciousness will get some level is, is learning and experiencing these different. 

00:15:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:15:30
HAL STONE If you're Youngean(ph) you'll learn it the symbolic way. I've you're a Gestalt you learn it the emotional way. If you're trans-personal you learn it that way. If you're Rikean(ph) you learn it that way. If you're a body worker. But it's all, it's all dealing with all these different energies. So, awareness and experience but we need one more thing. Who's going to put it together. Who's going to figure out how to act? Who's going to make choices? The ego. But that's a little complicated, isn't it because what we, what we discover in this work is what we think is our ego is really our primary selves. So if I've been trained as a rational mind, as a rational man and you say to me, who are you. I'm a rational man. 

00:16:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:16:05
HAL STONE Until you help me separate from that. 

00:16:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words, who you are, as, as you're describing it to me is some potential of pure awareness separate from all of your patterns and, and behaviors, and. 

00:16:20
HAL STONE, PhD Co-author, Embracing Our Selves 

00:16:20
HAL STONE Well, I am, I am all three of these things. I am, I am an aware ego that is taking advantage of this pure awareness and taking advantage of the experience, and I'm not identified with any. I am an orchestra conductor that is, that is trying to learn how to handle this amazing array of energy around me. I am uh, gardener who learns how to take care of all these plants and feed the animals that are inside of me and that inhabit me, my nature. 

00:16:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh, and if we use the metaphor, the orchestra conductor, the gardener, one gets a sense that to really be the fullest person that you can be you, you want to garden that has a great variety of plants all growing. Or an orchestra that plays every tone of music for you to conduct it. 

00:17:05
HAL STONE It makes life uh, very interesting and uh, I can't imagine anything worse than uh, a boring life. But people, some people are aware of a lot of these uh, different things inside and people are aware of a great many of them. And I believe that we're living in a time when more and more people on our planet are becoming more and more aware of this uh, fantastic uh, garden and zoo as you call it living inside of us, yes. 

00:17:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The, the classical fairy tales of western culture often refer to a story of an innocent young prince who, who goes out on a quest in to the world and he encounters dragons that have to be slain. Is the slaying of the dragon converts or transforms this innocent being into a hero. What does that mean to you? 

00:18:00
HAL STONE Well um, every disowned self means that the primary self is sitting on top of another part. A woman once has a dream that she's trying to stuff a 50 foot snake into a box and she's exhausting herself doing it. That's a beautiful example, you see, of where the primary self, her rational mind is trying to keep control over the snake. The snake is her instinctuality. She's exhausting herself. Okay. And every disown self means that there's a sum of energy that is not available to us. Every disown self becomes a dragon in our life. Because whatever we disown the universe brings back to us. If you are a powerful business person and you disown vulnerability, your oldest son will become, will be vulnerable or you will marry a woman who that's ultimately vulnerable. Or your German police dog will be totally vulnerable. If you disown power in your life and identify with love and, and relationship then you will bring into your life uh, if you're a woman you will bring in a man of immense power and immense authority. If, if a woman can't stand uh, bitchy women, her boss at work will be a bitchy person. The law of the psyche is that whatever we disown life brings us. If we can step back from that and see that, the dragon for what it is we realize that the dragon is really our disown self. That that person out there that is causing us all this stress and all this difficulty is really a teacher for us. The longer that we allow disowned selves to remain there the more heads they grow, exactly like in the fairy tale. They started off with one and end up with 12 or more. And by the time we're older uh, these get to be a very serious conditions. 

00:19:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. So there is a sense of, if I could return to the metaphor of Mother Theresa. For that woman to have all that energy to do all the work she's doing, she must of had, in, in a sense confront the disowned part of herself to, to allow it, And in some way release that energy for her work. 

00:20:10
HAL STONE Um, I don't know what she's wrestling with in her life. Okay. Maybe she has wrestled with demons and maybe she hasn't. There are a lot of people who live their life out of particular archetypes. There are a lot of people who live their lives out of, of a saint, of a saintly archetype. But uh, uh, a saintly self. There are other people who live their lives out of being a mother. There are others who live their lives out of being heroic. 

00:20:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words it might be totally unconscious on her part. 

00:20:35
HAL STONE Absolutely. 

00:20:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:20:40
HAL STONE Absolutely. It may have nothing to do with her. It may have to do with the fact that she really has identified with her system. It doesn't take away from who she is or what she does. But we need consciousness today. I mean that is our most precious commodity. We can't afford to be sentimental about people that may do wonderful work. You see what I mean. We still need to, to learn about these selves and what is it that moves people because uh, if we don't get enough consciousness we pay a big price. 

00:21:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You've in effect talked about embracing our disown selves and yet how can we do that when we truly find them disgusting. 

00:21:20
HAL STONE Well, we, we, we uh, I mean you're asking the $64 question you see. I don't expect somebody to embrace their disowned selves in one hour. Okay. But it really is very much like uh, Greek mythology, the, the lesson that the early Greek had to learn was that all the God's and Goddess had to be worshiped. Okay. If you were a worshiper of Apollo and his was your primary God. And he had to do with the mind and clarity and so forth. It was okay for you to worship Apollo and for him to be your favorite God. The only thing in mythology is, if you did not worship Dionysus at all, if you kept him out of the picture. He is the one that punishes you. He is the one that attacks you. The disown God or Goddess in mythology is the one that kills you. Okay, that's the principal. So, all that means is that you have to build the shrine to every God and Goddess. You can have your favorites you can't leave anyone out. So from out perspective, you see, we say you have to learn to value every self that's in us. That doesn't mean disown selves have to take you over. it just means they have to be valued. We have to build a shrine to them. 

00:22:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You're not implying permissive here. 

00:22:40
HAL STONE Oh, no. No, no, no. Because, well it's a matter of fact, I think one of the major problems with consciousness movement is that it has been too permissive. It has moved people from contraction to expansion. You see, it has moved people from a condition of being more conservative to identified with being more liberal. And what I say is, we have to step back from those two conditions into a condition of awareness. And with an aware ego we embrace the conservative part selves and we embrace the liberal part of our selves. And if we can hold the tension of those two parts then we have a much better opportunity to make real choices for our selves. 

00:23:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words, pure awareness, the possibility of developing an aware ego is one that sort of steps back from these competing dualities within us.. 

00:23:35
HAL STONE, PhD, Co-author, Embracing Our Selves 

00:23:35
HAL STONE Exactly. And you know a lot of disowned selves remember, if I locked you in a dungeon, shut the door, and then opened it eight years later, you would bite me. And I would deserve it because I locked you away. These disowned selves are just little pieces of energy. Or from my standpoint, God is energy. As far as I'm concerned energy is God. All I'm doing is locking away a piece of God and uh, uh, putting it in some kind of purgatory. So when it comes out it's, it's vicious. And we say, oh my god that's a terrible part. But it's terrible because we locked it away. And when you, you allow these parts out, in a safe setting, you see. I'm not talking about becoming that part. You allow them out and you begin to pay attention to them, they change. 

00:24:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE This suggest to me in dealing with the disowned parts of our selves, what uh, what, what might one really want to do is strengthen the primary part in order that it is large enough to incorporate the parts that we formally thought of as impossible or disgusting. 

00:24:50
HAL STONE Well, the principal for us, the way that we approach this, is we always work with people through the primary selves. So,for example, let's say you would have a disowned energy that has to do with uh, uh, being a very uh, selfish, self-aggrandizing person. Okay, that's a self that's in everybody. But you identified with being uh, uh, a proper nice person. Okay, that's disowned the other one. So, we would work with your nice person and we would spend a lot of time with the nice guy until you as an aware ego could separate them. Once you're separate as an aware ego and you recognize that I really appreciate this part, and what he's done for you. Okay. Now, we go to the other side but you're there as an aware ego. And you're able to appreciate this one and this one. 

00:25:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So, the process is is a little bit like embracing the parts of our selves that we've disowned and disowning a little bit the parts of our selves that we embraced all our lives. 

00:25:45
HAL STONE, PhD, Co-author, Embracing Our Selves 

00:25:45
HAL STONE In a certain sense it is that, yeah. Disowning parts that we've embraced but disowning them from a new place with deep appreciation and, and, and, uh, love. You know, you know, we remember the time when love has become very important. And I have no objection to, to love as a principal, it feels very good. I like when it comes to me, I love to give it. But if you're going to be loving you have to do the whole shot. You can't just love the primary selves. You also have to love the disown selves. If you love and embrace the disown selves it takes great courage. You see. But you can't be selective about it. 

00:26:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Otherwise there's a sense in which we may be even resent having to be loving all the time, having to be nice all the time. Our, our love loses its authenticity if we can't come from the fullness. 

00:26:35
HAL STONE Exactly. I mean if somebody is trained to be loving uh, the danger is you can build a love temple on top of a garbage dump, That kind of loving does not support the evolution of consciousness in the world. We have to deal with the dump also, we have to pick up all these disowned selves and begin to bring them into the light of day and see what they're about. 

00:26:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, Hal, you seem to be saying, in order to be fully real we have to be fully whole, whole in our selves. We've run out of time, Hal. It's been a pleasure. Thanks so much for being with me. 

00:27:05
HAL STONE Thank you very much. 

00:27:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And thank you for being with us.

00:27:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome back. I'm Jeffrey Mishlove with Hal Stone again. And during the next hour we will be exploring and demonstrating the voice dialogue technique. Hal, how did and Cedra originally developed this technique? 

00:28:10
HAL STONE Well, it developed in a very interesting way. Um, it didn't develop as a, it didn't start as a technique. Uh, I was uh, Youngean analyst at that time and Cedra was a psychotherapist. And she was in charge of a uh, treatment center for acting out adolescent girls. And we met under uh, let's say a rather difficult circumstances, I won't go into to details, it's not necessary. But we didn't have much time together and uh, we spent a lot of the time we did have working psychologically with each other because we met and fell in love, that opened us up in a particular way. And uh, as a Youngean, I, uh, had spent a lot of time working with parts under the concepts that were very basic to understanding the unconscious. And she had, had a considerable amount of Gestalt work and uh, I had also done Gestalt work. And I was familiar with parts, you know, for many different ways. 

00:29:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Parts meaning? 

00:29:05
HAL STONE Parts meaning different selves, the different personality. It wasn't a new idea at all. After all ever system of therapy and growth is dealing with parts in some way or other. 

00:29:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:29:15
HAL STONE So um, what happened uh, those specifically one day um, we were talking about vulnerability. Now, vulnerability is something that I knew as a word, but it had nothing with me as a person. I mean I'd gotten a PhD, I, I was an analyst, I was very successful. Uh, and if I ever was vulnerable I didn't know it. Power was the name of game for me. I'd lost my vulnerability when I was a little boy, that was it. And one day, Cedra was in the same position, very sophisticated Manhattanite and uh, a power-person. We were talking about vulnerability and I said to her could I talk to the part of her that uh, feels vulnerable. And uh, to my great shock, you know, she uh, uh, literally laid down on the couch and uh, entered into a kind of pre-verbal state and stayed there for, for an hour, and hour and half without talking. She was, she was literally uh, an infant child. You have to know my wife to appreciate that. But it was very shocking. And when she finally came out of it, I mean we began to talk about it. And said, this is uh, this is amazing. The next week she did the same thing with me and I found myself going into exactly the same place. The shock of that really began to push us into an exploration of what this was about. We spent more time in vulnerability, what we discovered in that condition of vulnerability is that I became the child. It was not anything theoretical, it wasn't the word. It wasn't being vulnerable. I had experienced the vulnerable child that lives in me. And she had experienced the vulnerable child that lives in her. It's, it's a real child. It's a real honest to God child. This was a shock. I, I dealt with inner child for years and years, and years as an analyst. And in Gestalt work I've dealt with children and acted out the parts. I never had the experience of the reality of it. You see, Well, from there we began to explore other, other parts. Uh, I was aware of the fact that there was something that pushed me a lot, that drove me a lot. Well, she said, let's talk to the part of you that pushes you. And suddenly an endowed pusher talking to me constantly, telling me to buy books that I never read. I have, I have a library of, of thousands of books, 90% of which I haven't read. I never bought them. He bought them. Every time I go into a bookstore, he goes into the bookstore, buys the books, lays them out on the table. So I can see them, and then, and then I discover another one, a critic. Who when I don't read the books criticizes me because I don't read the books. And suddenly this amazing cast of characters began to emerge. It was mind boggling. 

00:32:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It sounds like the pusher and the critic got a one two punch there. 

00:32:15
HAL STONE You've, you've said it exactly. That's exactly how we described it a one two punch because if you buy the, if you buy the requirements of the pusher then the critic has a very easy entry point because you have no guard. So, if the critic says, "Well, you should, you should read all the books of Froyd, all the books of Young, all the books of Gestalt work, all the new age training of the new physics and so forth." If, if the pusher says that what I should do and I'm identified with that pusher then all I can feel is inadequate. You see, all I can do is feel inferior because my critic is constantly sounding in my head. So we work with the pushers and critics and the accusers and each other, and the observer and the uh, parts that have to do with control. And then we began to work with a lot of the disown energies, which vulnerability was a key one. And for me the demonic my instinctual energies. I began to uh, to uh, objectify by those. And it was just really an amazing experience. And it never, we never considered the idea that it was a system of work for at least three years. 

00:33:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE All you began doing is saying, I'd like to speak to. 

00:33:30
HAL STONE Yeah, I'd like to talk to such. That's all it was, it was nothing more than that. And then we discovered also that some of the parts like to talk. And some of the parts are silent. And we began to tune into the fact that there's a way of working with people that's totally energetics. So for example, if I'm working with her child, her child doesn't talk very much. She was a very sensitive child, and I have to learn to be silent. And by learning to be silent and relating to her child, that was a bit teaching for me. What I began to realize is that as a facilitator, as psychotherapist I was developing in a very different way. Because I was becoming increasingly sensitive to the fact that each of these parts, each of these selves is a true energetic. Is uh, it's like uh, uh, a vibrating system. If I'm dealing with her Aphrodite energy, her sensual energy that's another thing that's going like this. It's a strong energy that is moving. If I'm talking to her very sensitive child, it's a very quiet energy. So you begin to tune in energetically to them you see. Some are noisy and love to talk. Some are very silent. And then gradually the thing begin to evolve until after about three years we began to see that this was something we were doing. And we could use it in practice. And then the next step in the evolution that there was when we got married. And um, began to see the some of the same patterns where emerging in our marriage that had occurred before. And since we were both very much in love and the relationship meant a lot to us. Uh, speaking for my self, I was totally committed to the idea, I was not going to mess up this marriage. 

00:35:05
HAL STONE, PhD, Co-author, Embracing Our Selves 

00:35:10
HAL STONE And I was not going to get into those same patterns. So, we began to examine the interaction of the pattern. 

00:35:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So, in other words, how the different selves in you interacted with her various, uh. 

00:35:20
HAL STONE Exactly, so, she discovers the father side of me, okay. Now, I have a very good father, who can, is so good and so loving and so kind. And uh, gives anything, you know. But if I identify with that good father it's not very long before the opposite of that takes over and that's the negative father. But if the negative father takes over look out. He's very nasty guy. Sometimes he can withdraw. I've been to a very withdrawn place. Which drives women crazy because it throws women into the daughter place. And they want, you know, the want something from the man, and the man is there. Or I could be an angry father, you know, So we began to work with each other in these parts but we began to really examine it from, from a relationship standpoint to see how these interactions took place and what they were all about. So, that really was the development of the whole theory of uh, relationship that uh, has been going on for now about five years with her. That's the last book that we wrote. 

00:36:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, can we do a little of this work. I'll, I'll certainly be willing to, I guess with limits volunteer myself here. 

00:36:40
HAL STONE Well, let me speak to that for a moment here. 

00:36:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:36:40
HAL STONE Jeff, within limits, okay. Uh, in the development of personality, the first part of us to develop as I mentioned earlier uh, is, we call the protector controller. The protector controller develops very early in the game. Uh, a child may be six months old or a year old and this protector controller recognizes for example, that uh, the mother enjoys when the child smiles. Protector controller wants me to smile then. because it wants the mother happy. Because if the mother's happy the vulnerable child is kept safe. So I may like to smile, but now smiling as a natural function is being overwritten by the requirements of the protector controller. My father likes physical things he likes to punch and wrestle. I may hate it, I may be terrorized of it. Protector controller says hey, you know, this man like to knock you around, laugh. So that becomes an over-ride to my behavior. So the protector controller then is really the one that starts all the primary selves going. In this work the very basic assumption of the work is, we always work first with the primary selves. That means that we're going to try to find out what is, what are the selves that you identified with when you were growing up. And what are the selves that you identified, that you're still identified with. Because this, this is a situation that's all through life. We start to talk to all those parts. Okay. They let us know what we're allowed to talk to. They let us know where we're allowed to go. They are the guardians of the garden. They are the dragons at the gate. We never violate the requirements of these primary selves. So if your primary self says, well it's okay with me, that Jeffrey he uh, uh, you know, does this work. But I don't want him to be crying, or I don't want him to loose control. That's the rule. No crying and there's no loss of control. And if that would happen I would actually move you or whoever was with back to that primary self and say, look I'm awfully sorry but this happened and I want to talk it over with you. 

00:39:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PhD 

00:39:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words, in other words, it sound like what you're saying is the last thing you would do in a therapeutic situation where your client is attempting to maintain control, the last thing you would do is accuse them of copping out. 

00:39:20
HAL STONE I think that's a very destructive act to human beings. It violates who we are. Uh, if it's anything that we have uh, learned in this work is to appreciate all of the different energies. And the part that needs to control our behavior is very legitimate, very important part. And to condemn that, and incidentally, very common in consciousness work. To condemn, to condemn that is I, I think a violation of the whole conservative part of our nature. 

00:39:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:39:50
HAL STONE Uh, it's also not good psychotherapy. Because I'm also not dumb. What I mean by that is, if I truly mean what I say and I, and I, your primary selves and your protector controller learn to trust me and trust this process what's going to happen. They're going to relax. They're going to open up. They're going to let me in. Do I care if it takes 3 months for them to let me in or 6 months or 1 month. Does it matter to me? No. It doesn't matter to me. Because when they let me in it will be organic and it will be safe. And I'm not going to split you. Many years ago before we started doing this kind of work um, I mean I knew how to very easily make people yell, and holler. I did body work and Gestalt work, I know how to do all that. But why? For what reason do we have to throw people into those conditions unnecessarily, you see. Even take something like working with anger. A lot of people say I want to get out my anger. I don't have to jump and put you into an anger voice. Um, that's very easy to teach you how to yell and scream. Instead I'm, I'm interested in what are the parts of you that object to the noise. What are they afraid of. See I want to work with primary selves until I can really understand and appreciate why the came to play. Why were they born in you. What were they protecting. What was your father doing or your mother doing that made it necessary for these primary selves to kill anger and to kill crying and so forth, you see. Once I fully appreciate the primary selves then to go to the other side is okay. It's not a violation of that. So right now, I think what we can do is just look at what the primary selves might be in your life and pick one of them. And start there. 

00:41:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

00:41:45
HAL STONE So, do you have a sense of yourself of uh, a starting place. You mentioned earlier to me that uh, you'd been a rebel in your life. And you, you revolted against your father a lot, who was more of uh, traditional business man. 

00:42:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's right. 

00:42:00
HAL STONE That's pretty common. I, I mean my father was my disown self also. Uh, that's one possibility. We could work with the rebel, which would be a primary self. 

00:42:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Fine. 

00:42:15
HAL STONE You want to start there? 

00:42:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:42:15
HAL STONE Okay. So, the way we do this, in this work whenever we talk to a self, we always want physically to move the chair. Uh, the reason is, is that it helps you as an aware ego identify the parts. And it helps me as the facilitator keep track of the different parts. If we only work with two people um, that's easy to keep in mind. But sometimes you can be working with five or six in a session. 

00:42:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It could be a group process. 

00:42:45
HAL STONE Yes. 

00:42:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:42:50
HAL STONE As a matter of fact um, uh, I was talking to a woman this weekend who was getting married, a second marriage and she, she knows this work. And she actually uh, did a procedure where she held a conference with all the parts of her that didn't want to get married. And she set up, uh, a nup- a prenuptial agreement. Not with her husband to be but with these parts. 

00:43:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words, group process, you mean the inner group. 

00:43:15
HAL STONE Inner group. 

00:43:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And not like group therapy. 

00:43:20
HAL STONE Oh, no, no. I'm talking about the inner group. 

00:43:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's really a one-on-one process in terms of bodies? 

00:43:25
HAL STONE Yes. 

00:43:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

00:43:25
HAL STONE Yeah, there just the two of us here physically and a multitude that are invisible. 

00:43:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We, we might mention in starting that some of the therapeutic antecedents of this work do include things like psychodrama. 

00:43:35
HAL STONE Oh, absolutely. Uh, the uh, Youngean(ph) and Gestalt works, psycho-synthesis, psychodrama, TA, and all of these are antecedents. That I'm sure if they hadn't been there we wouldn't of come up with voice dialogue, no question about that. Absolutely. So why don't we begin then with the rebel. And why don't you just move over a little bit, where ever the rebel wants to be. 

00:44:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Do I close my eyes? 

00:44:00
HAL STONE No, no, no. Absolutely not. 

00:44:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. I have this instinct to kind of. 

00:44:05
HAL STONE Ah, that's how it is. 

00:44:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE To go like this. Oh, yeah. 

00:44:05
HAL STONE Yeah. This is Jeffrey sitting over here. And uh, good evening. 

00:44:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Good evening. 

00:44:15
HAL STONE How are you? 

00:44:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I'm fine. How are you? 

00:44:15
HAL STONE Good. Uh, tell me a little bit about self. I know from Jeffrey that you rep.-, that you're the part of him that is a rebel. And I'd like to get some idea of what your function is in his life, how you operate. 

00:44:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I protect him from the world, you know. You know the world is very, very corrupt. One has to stand against it. And I ensure that he does. That he's uh, a voice standing against the, the mindless mob. 

00:44:40
HAL STONE I see. 

00:44:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The mindless herd. 

00:44:45
HAL STONE Uh-huh. So you're always looking then for situations or people uh, uh, that might be um, creating injustice. Would that be the kind of thing you look for? 

00:44:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Injustice is one thing. The primarily mindless conventionality. 

00:45:00
HAL STONE Mindless conventionality. 

00:45:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:45:05
HAL STONE Okay. Can you give me an example of what you mean by that. 

00:45:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, uh. 

00:45:10
HAL STONE The kind of thing that really would tick you off. Where, where you know, where you would react to that strongly. 

00:45:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE These days I'm much mellower then I once was with Jeffrey. There was a time in his life for example, when he was planning to become a graduate student uh, an undergraduate business major. 

00:45:30
HAL STONE Mm-huh. 

00:45:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In college and following along the path that had been set out for him father, who ran a small business. And Jeffrey expected, well, it was assumed he would take over the business. 

00:45:40
HAL STONE I see. 

00:45:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE He would be in business. 

00:45:45
HAL STONE You, you rebelled against that. 

00:45:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes I did. 

00:45:45
HAL STONE Okay. And you pulled him out of that and set him on a different path. 

00:45:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You bet we got him on a very different track. 

00:45:50
HAL STONE Uh-huh. Where did you take him? 

00:45:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, we got him involved in a realm of psychology, in the realm of art, in the realm of creativity. Altered states of consciousness, uh, political activism. 

00:46:05
HAL STONE Well, that would do the job. 

00:46:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes, well, it, it was quite convenient, that uh, all of the counter culture activities came along about that time. Made my job easier. 

00:46:15
HAL STONE So, you were the one who went to Berkley then? 

00:46:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Oh, yes. 

00:46:15
HAL STONE I mean, you were enrolled in Berkley. 

00:46:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I'm the one who got him out of the state of Wisconsin. 

00:46:20
HAL STONE I see. 

00:46:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But, but for me he would probably be still in the Midwest. 

00:46:25
HAL STONE I see. Uh-huh, that's very, very interesting. 

00:46:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:46:30
HAL STONE But you have mellowed through the years apparently. 

00:46:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes, yes. I have because I, I feel like I, I've done my work. 

00:46:35
HAL STONE Yeah. 

00:46:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Largely. I don't feel that I'm as needed as I once was. 

00:46:40
HAL STONE I see. Why is that? What do you think the change is in Jeffrey that, you know, that? 

00:46:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, times have changed. It's, it's as if, to some extent society has caught up. 

00:46:50
HAL STONE Yeah. 

00:46:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE With me now. 

00:46:50
HAL STONE Right. 

00:46:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's not as mindless as it once was. 

00:46:55
HAL STONE That's interesting, in a way then you really had to become the rebel because the culture itself was so mindless. That like somebody had to stand against that. 

00:47:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Somebody had to stand against it. It was very essential. 

00:47:05
HAL STONE Yeah. And that was your job. 

00:47:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Essential now, but it, it made me so militant. 

00:47:10
HAL STONE I see. 

00:47:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Any longer. 

00:47:15
HAL STONE I see. 

00:47:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I, I think I've learned the importance of subtlety in rebellion. 

00:47:20
HAL STONE Fantastic. Very interesting. Is there any current situation that is operating that uh, you sort of look at and have concern about. 

00:47:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I suppose uh, it's almost as if uh, where as the consciousness movement stood against the mainstream culture. Today it's the consciousness movement itself that uh, that Jeffrey needs to be vigilant about. 

00:47:45
HAL STONE Ah. 

00:47:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE As if there's a new orthodoxy in, in the field of consciousness. 

00:47:50
HAL STONE You, okay. I just got it. Orthodoxy is the key, ah. It doesn't matter where the orthodoxy comes from. You smell orthodox. 

00:48:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I sure do. 

00:48:00
HAL STONE And that's when you really come into operation. And if you feel that the consciousness movement is knocking into an orthodoxy, you'll fight. 

00:48:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yep. 

00:48:10
HAL STONE Okay. 

00:48:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But I won't necessarily fight. 

00:48:10
HAL STONE Yeah. 

00:48:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Militantly. 

00:48:10
HAL STONE Right. 

00:48:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE There are other ways. 

00:48:15
HAL STONE Right, I got you. Well, it's fascinating talking with you. 

00:48:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Nice to talk to you also. 

00:48:20
HAL STONE Anything else I should know about you? 

00:48:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, uh, I had gotten Jeffrey into a lot of trouble at times. 

00:48:25
HAL STONE Well, I can imagine. Can you give us and example of the kind of trouble that you've gotten him into. 

00:48:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I, I push him. 

00:48:35
HAL STONE Uh-huh. 

00:48:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I, I mean I work also with a pusher. 

00:48:35
HAL STONE Oh, I see. So he has a strong pusher that's part of your energy behind you. 

00:48:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's it. It's just like that. We grab him and before he knows what's happening he's, he's, sometimes has rebelled. It's, it's, it's as if I have to, honestly I have to rebel against myself at times. Because I don't want him to rebel mindlessly either, but. 

00:48:55
HAL STONE Well that's something. 

00:48:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It has come to that occasionally. 

00:48:55
HAL STONE Yeah, but somebody else really is becoming aware. It's almost like Jeffrey is becoming aware of your rebellion and is able to stop it at times. He has some awareness of you now. 

00:49:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:49:10
HAL STONE That's the difference. 

00:49:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's true. He is, he is aware of us. 

00:49:10
HAL STONE In the early days you were Jeffrey in the early days. 

00:49:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's right. 

00:49:15
HAL STONE Well, let's see. In the early, early days the conservative over here was Jeffrey. 

00:49:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The conservative over there. 

00:49:20
HAL STONE Yeah, the one that enrolled in the business school. 

00:49:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:49:25
HAL STONE He used to be Jeffrey. 

00:49:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's right. 

00:49:25
HAL STONE Then at one point you took over and you became Jeffrey. 

00:49:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I became Jeffrey. 

00:49:30
HAL STONE Okay. And then you work with this pusher. And all, almost a militant warrior in some way. 

00:49:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE If you were to see me as I really look, I'd have long and a beard. 

00:49:40
HAL STONE Uh-huh, yeah, got you. 

00:49:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:49:45
HAL STONE Okay. I wonder if it might be just interesting to meet that pusher just for a moment. 

00:49:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

00:49:50
HAL STONE Okay. How about just uh, just a little bit over in reality we'd move farther. That's, that's perfect. Hello. 

00:50:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello. 

00:50:00
HAL STONE Well, can you tell me a little bit about yourself. Now, I have some idea from him of what your function is, but does it, what is your job as, as the pusher inside Jeffrey? 

00:50:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I don't know what to say. I just push. I push, I kick ass even. 

00:50:20
HAL STONE Uh-huh. So in other words, you don't like him to be passive, is that the idea? 

00:50:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's right, that's right. He has a uh, a manualable(ph) side to him, a flexible side. 

00:50:30
HAL STONE I see. 

00:50:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE A mutable side. And, and he gets pushed around a lot which gives me an opportunity to push him as well. 

00:50:40
HAL STONE I see. So whenever he feels too manualable to you or he gets too passive or any sense like that you really kick. 

00:50:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well he opens himself up to me. 

00:50:45
HAL STONE I see. 

00:50:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE He opens up to a lot of people. 

00:50:50
HAL STONE Uh-huh. 

00:50:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE He's opened up to you right now, so. 

00:50:50
HAL STONE I see. 

00:50:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh, people push him around and so do I. 

00:50:55
HAL STONE I see. Now, as I understand it you work, you used to work a lot with the rebel. 

00:51:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah, yeah. Still do. 

00:51:05
HAL STONE You still do. 

00:51:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:51:05
HAL STONE How do you work the rebel? I mean, what do you? 

00:51:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, when I sense the rebel judging a certain situation, I kind of grab him by the throat. 

00:51:15
HAL STONE Mm-hmm. 

00:51:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know, and give him a little lump in the throat and then maybe tighten up his stomach a bit. 

00:51:20
HAL STONE I see. 

00:51:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And then he gets the message, you know, that he's in a situation that he's just going to flew from, he's going to avoid. He, he knows when I start to do that there's no way he's going to stay there. 

00:51:35
HAL STONE Uh-huh. Now you're, the, what is the purpose of what you do is what? I mean as the pusher. 

00:51:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I, I, I manipulate him. 

00:51:45
HAL STONE You manipulate him. 

00:51:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:51:45
HAL STONE Okay. Now, what the rebel said is that you will, you will team up with the rebel and make him rebel in a very, very forceful way. 

00:51:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, yes. But a lot, a lot of his rebellion hasn't necessarily been through direct confrontational. A lot of his rebellion has been through fleeing or avoiding conventional situations. 

00:52:05
HAL STONE Oh, I see. Oh, I got it now. 

00:52:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:52:10
HAL STONE Okay, I was thinking of the confrontation. So, I gather you just make sure he doesn't stay around anything conventional. 

00:52:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's basically it. I mean he, he has his confrontations but he, you know, he does those on his own. I, I don't push him into those. 

00:52:20
HAL STONE Got you. 

00:52:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Very often. 

00:52:25
HAL STONE Okay. Okay, that's pretty clear to me. I appreciate that. Could we come back real quick just for a moment to the rebel. Thank you. Uh, I want to ask you something, okay. You were listening to uh, my discussion of the primary selves. 

00:52:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:52:40
HAL STONE Okay, and the protector controller. 

00:52:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:52:40
HAL STONE And really you have been one of Jeffrey's primary self for a long. 

00:52:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I have been. 

00:52:45
HAL STONE And you've done a very important job. 

00:52:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:52:45
HAL STONE And uh, uh, in terms of the history of the consciousness movement you, you know, your function in the '60's, you were part of a very important drama that took place. 

00:53:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:53:00
HAL STONE Um, having talked to you it's clear to me that Jeffrey has a very conventional self also. That would be your opposite. 

00:53:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah, mm-hmm. 

00:53:10
HAL STONE Right? 

00:53:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's right. 

00:53:10
HAL STONE um, how would you feel about my talking to that part of Jeffrey? 

00:53:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE All right. 

00:53:15
HAL STONE It wouldn't bother you? 

00:53:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I, I, we've gotten to know each other over the years. 

00:53:20
HAL STONE Okay. 

00:53:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It feels almost as if, you know, I'm like a past president to the Board of Directors, up here. 

00:53:25
HAL STONE Got you, okay. 

00:53:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And conventional self is part of the Board. 

00:53:30
HAL STONE Jeffrey, really has developed a considerable amount of awareness, so he is really not identified with you any more. 

00:53:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Not totally. 

00:53:35
HAL STONE Makes a lot more possible. Yeah. 

00:53:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Some separation. 

00:53:40
HAL STONE Okay. Okay. Let's go come back to Jeffrey for a moment. Okay. Now, in um, it would be theoretically possible for me to go right to the other side, but I want to come back to the ego. 

00:53:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

00:53:55
HAL STONE And I want to just sort of talk about things for a little bit, Okay. 

00:54:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So, so this moment we're not doing voice dialogue. 

00:54:00
HAL STONE No, we're, we're in the. 

00:54:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Back to the interview. 

00:54:05
HAL STONE Yeah. Well, I'm, I'm conversing now with the ego. Okay. Now, in your situation you have been in, in consciousness work for a long time and you have awareness, okay. If you had no awareness, okay, that rebel would be much stronger. If I talked to you 20 years ago, in that place, I would of had a very, very straightened rebel. And that's who you would of been. And I couldn't have, I couldn't have even convinced you on any grounds that you were separate from the rebel. I wouldn't been able to do it, you see. 

00:54:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Possible not. 

00:54:40
HAL STONE Because when we're totally identified with the primary self that's who we are. 

00:54:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I would have good logical reasons for everything. 

00:54:45
HAL STONE That's the way it is, okay. And we see, uh, it's a beautiful example of what happens with awareness, you see. He's still there, he's still active. He can still kick ass. But you're not fully identified with him anymore, you see. 

00:55:00
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Right. 

00:55:05
HAL STONE Because another thing that would happen is if you were fully identified, he would not be happy with my talking to this guy. He would not be happy. He would object strenuously. 

00:55:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah. 

00:55:10
HAL STONE Because his job is to keep one buried, you see. 

00:55:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Now it's as if they're both part of the same committee, they have a working relationship. 

00:55:25
HAL STONE That your in charge of. Another thing about this work is we have no need to make different parts friendly with each other. Okay. As far as I'm concerned the rebel and the conservative can hate each other as much as they want. It's not a problem for me at all. I don't have to have them talk to each other. I don't have to resolve any conflict between them. That's your job. What I, my job is to help you develop awareness and an aware ego so you can carry the tension of those opposites. You have to learn how to sweat. You have to learn how to embrace both of them and make appropriate choices. 

00:56:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It sounds like you're also saying I have to chose to, to do that. If I wish to. 

00:56:05
HAL STONE Yes. Well, if you're identified with a primary self there's no choice. You can't choose to be with both parts because that's who you are. The moment you separate then this becomes available, then you begin to have choices about whether you want to consider both or what you want to do with them or you know, whether you embrace both of them. 

00:56:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE My job, in any case. 

00:56:30
HAL STONE Yes. 

00:56:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:56:30
HAL STONE That is very relaxing to me, as a therapist because I don't have the job of um, resolving your issue. That makes me very happy. You see, if my job is to help you develop an aware ego and teach you how to embrace opposites that makes my work much simpler then it makes my life much longer. because I'm not going to be identified with the same level of responsibility, as a therapist, you see. My need to help you resolve conflict is the thing that's the most stress inducing for me. So, in this work I uh, I don't help you resolve conflict. I teach you to embrace opposites and I teach you to live with it in a new way. That's the difference. 

00:57:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

00:57:15
HAL STONE So, now let's hear from the other side, and see what the conservative has to say. Okay. 

00:57:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:57:25
HAL STONE Let's move over a touch here. 

00:57:30
[sil.] 

00:57:30
HAL STONE Good evening. 

00:57:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello. 

00:57:35
HAL STONE You've been listening to this discussion also. 

00:57:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. With some embarrassment. 

00:57:40
HAL STONE Okay. What is embarrassing to you about the whole thing. I mean what is it that troubles you or embarrasses you? 

00:57:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I must admit I, I am embarrassed by that rebel. 

00:57:50
HAL STONE Hmm. Even though he's cooled down a lot from what he says, I mean. 

00:57:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, he says he's cooled down but you could see by his posture, really that he was very closed. 

00:58:00
HAL STONE Uh-huh. 

00:58:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That he insists on being separate on being different, somehow. Well he, he's, you know, quite hard to get to. He, he's not quite human to me. 

00:58:10
HAL STONE I see, that's interesting He's not human to you. 

00:58:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well he, he keeps himself so distant.It's as if he's always judging me. 

00:58:25
HAL STONE Yeah, well that's sort of his job in a way, isn't it. I mean you were there first. 

00:58:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:58:30
HAL STONE Right. 

00:58:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes, I was. 

00:58:30
HAL STONE Yeah. Do you remember the point in Jeffrey's life when he took over from you? Do you remember when that happened? 

00:58:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, it was a gradual process. I suppose uh, I suppose it happened in, during, during the 1960's or his undergraduate years in college. 

00:58:55
HAL STONE Uh-huh. So, you were there pretty strongly in the early years of college? 

00:59:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:59:00
HAL STONE But somewhere, it was pretty hard in the '60's at Berkley for you to stay around very much, wasn't it? 

00:59:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, in, in the '60's I was at Madison, Wisconsin. 

00:59:10
HAL STONE Madison, I see. 

00:59:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know, it, it was funny because it became conventional really, to, sideburns grow a little longer. It became conventional to let the hair grow a little longer. It became conventional to. 

00:59:20
HAL STONE I see. 

00:59:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Grow a beard in that milieu(ph) it became conventional to experiment with various modes of consciousness alterations. 

00:59:30
HAL STONE So, really the opposite of the rebel, is, is, you're one side of it but the real opposite of the rebel is the part of Jeffrey that would be just ordinary. 

00:59:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:59:40
HAL STONE Just absolutely ordinary Jeffrey. 

00:59:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE To go along with what's happening. 

00:59:45
HAL STONE Yeah. Just ordinary, Sears & Roebuck. 

00:59:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Penny's, Sears & Roebuck, you know. 

00:59:50
HAL STONE Penny's. 

00:59:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. Uh-huh. 

00:59:50
HAL STONE I would love to talk to Sears & Roebuck. Okay. Just the absolutely ordinary not special Jeffrey. Just totally ordinary. Just move over again. Just a little touch, okay. 

01:00:10
[sil.] 

01:00:20
HAL STONE You have a sense of who you are? 

01:00:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I, I feel very vulnerable. I feel, you know. 

01:00:20
HAL STONE Yeah. 

01:00:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Frightened of you even a little bit. Uh, I wonder what I'm doing here. 

01:00:30
HAL STONE Yeah. Their job was really to protect you, isn't it. Because you are very vulnerable. Their job really was, they, these guys had to come in to protect you. 

01:00:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:00:45
HAL STONE Where you always vulnerable? Yeah. So he really had to build up this, this power and this strength to take care of you because you were, I imagine that uh, his father wouldn't of cared about you to much. Because you were really the vulnerable one, the father was pretty strong and pretty. 

01:01:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I, I cried a lot. 

01:01:15
HAL STONE Yeah, yeah. Well you're the part of him that cries, you're the vulnerable part. That's who you are. Yeah. 

01:01:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. My father always used to want a tuffy. 

01:01:25
HAL STONE Yeah, yeah. Well, he learned how to be tough. And in away it did an important job for him, you know. How uh, about today in his life, I mean these days as an adult. Does he get a chance to hang out with you at all. 

01:01:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE No, not much. 

01:01:40
HAL STONE Not to much. 

01:01:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Occasionally, occasionally. It, it does him good but, I can uh, I can kind of overwhelm him at times. 

01:01:50
HAL STONE Yeah. What would happen if Jeffrey uh, decided he was going to begin to really take care of you. You know what I mean, like he was going to become a real father to you and really look after you. What, what would that feel like? What would you like him to do? 

01:02:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That would be great. Then we could have a lot of fun together. 

01:02:10
HAL STONE Yeah, I bet you could. What would you, what would make you feel good? What could he do that would really make you feel good? 

01:02:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, you know, I'd like to be with him more when he does his interviews, you know, I kind of often get pushed into the background. And I think he, he might even be a more sensitive interviewer with me. 

01:02:25
HAL STONE Uh-huh. I'm sure he would. Mm-hmm, you're uh, very precious to have around. 

01:02:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:02:30
HAL STONE Anything else that uh, you'd like, make you feel good? 

01:02:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I, my needs are simply. I, I just like to, I like to be felt. 

01:02:40
HAL STONE Yeah. 

01:02:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I just like to be felt. That's, that's enough. 

01:02:45
HAL STONE Yeah. You know you're very close to the surface of him, you know what I mean. For example when I met Jeffrey I felt you right away. 

01:02:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mmm. 

01:02:55
HAL STONE I mean it's not that he let you out but I, I felt your presence very strongly. 

01:03:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:03:00
HAL STONE Which is very important to me because if I, I don't feel the child inside somebody it makes me nervous. 

01:03:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah, but I didn't know that. 

01:03:10
HAL STONE Yeah. 

01:03:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:03:10
HAL STONE Well, of course not, you're, you've been disowned to a large extent. 

01:03:15
[sil.] 

01:03:15
HAL STONE I could hang around you for a long time. 

01:03:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Oh, thank you. Gosh. 

01:03:35
HAL STONE Okay. Let's uh, I think we're going to go back to Jeffrey now. Okay. 

01:03:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

01:03:35
HAL STONE Because I realize if I stay with you too much longer, you, you have pretty deep waters in you, and I think it might be better to go back to Jeffrey. 

01:03:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's a little embarrassing. 

01:03:35
HAL STONE Yeah, I know. The big guys are embarrassed. Okay, let's go back to Jeffrey. Okay. 

01:03:45
[sil.] 

01:03:45
HAL STONE So, if uh, we were, you know, in the work and taking a lot of time, I, I work very quickly here because it's demonstration work. But if we were um, spending a lot of time together. I would uh, sit silently with that child much longer. 

01:04:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:04:15
HAL STONE Because inejectedly, if I were with him over time he would deepen. 

01:04:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:04:20
HAL STONE And the silence deepens the process. 

01:04:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's because he wasn't comfortable talking 

01:04:25
HAL STONE He's not a talker. I kept the talking going. 

01:04:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:04:25
HAL STONE Artificially because I think he would of cried. 

01:04:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:04:30
HAL STONE If I had been silent. 

01:04:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:04:35
HAL STONE Because the tears were there. 

01:04:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right on the edge. 

01:04:35
HAL STONE And I didn't feel that that was something that we would want to get into. And I, we just met uh, this afternoon. And I felt that would not be a way to go now. But I think it puts over our point very well. So, it's interesting when we look at what we work with here because. Well, at this point what we do is something very interesting in the voice dialogue process, that we're not going to do here. First of all I ask the person what, what he's own feelings are. If they feel like talking about any of this. 

01:05:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:05:05
HAL STONE Is there anything you feel like sharing yourself? 

01:05:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I must say this moment I feel larger. I, I feel all of those selves are with me, and, and there's an expanding feeling, feeling them all together at once. Were as 20, 30 minutes ago when we started I, there was more of a contracted feeling. 

01:05:30
HAL STONE Mm-hmm. 

01:05:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Although I wouldn't of thought of it as contracted but from this perspective I, I do. 

01:05:35
HAL STONE Oh, it's a pretty common feeling of people uh, because one does expand, you know. The next thing I would have you do uh, ordinarily is to stand next to me and we together look back at, at the parts. And then I would summarize. The reason I would have you stand next to me is I want you standing because that gives more of the a feeling of awareness, in the witness state. 

01:06:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The witness state? 

01:06:00
HAL STONE Yeah. So, you'd be standing and I would summarize generally without you talking. Now the kind of summary I give is going to vary depending on my experience. If you're a very experienced facilitator and experienced therapist the summary can be very intense, very psycho-dynamic summary. If you don't know as much, then it's less. So, we started out with working with the rebel who's been in charge of Jeffrey's life. Remember you're standing here now, and this is the aware ego. Has been in charge of Jeffrey's life since he was in college. His job is to smell anything that has to do with ordinariness, mediocrity. With uh, with convention and then he wants Jeffrey to really move against that in some way. We also discover that he works a lot with the pusher in Jeffrey, that we talked to a little bit. And that, that pusher uh, and uh, this rebel get together and make a very strong energy, the absolutely drive Jeffrey away from anything that, that has to do, to do with let's say convention. Make a very strong energy. The rebel has changed a lot because Jeffrey has become much more aware through the years. So, he isn't as uh, um, heavy-handed as he used to be. But apparently he used to be pretty heavy-handed from what he says. On the other side we, we talk first to the part that's conservative and he, he feels the rebel's still pretty strong and he's pretty uncomfortable with him. 

01:07:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

01:07:35
HAL STONE But when we moved over to the one who has to do with ordinariness we came to, to uh, the child side. And that part carries Jeffrey's vulnerability and he's softness and sensitive. And uh, we uh, held that a fairly short time and chose not to deepen that because he ha a lot of tears in him and uh, this didn't feel like the place to let that come out. Uh, just take a moment and watch what's, what, witness those parts. And then you just really, you can do that from this place as you, as though you're in a meditation. Mediators will often just sit and witness the different parts. You can also see how valuable this is to meditation. Because now if you're a mediator in your meditative process you have separated out these systems. And you can literally witness them and what they're saying or feeling in the meditation. So it goes along beautifully with the meditative process. And then we would generally just uh, see if there's any other discussion and that would be, would be the end of the session essentially. 

01:08:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. Well, I do have a sense, for just that moment as I began meditating on it all that there was uh, uh, a feeling like all of this is orchestrated by some other voice like a higher consciousness, you haven't really addressed yet. 

01:09:05
HAL STONE Well uh, one can uh, address the higher consciousness uh, as a voice. I mean in the dialogue process you, you have limitations as to what you can tap into. I can tap into certain levels of trans-personal energy with you. I can say let me move over into the higher consciousness space or into the trans-personal space. And then if I had that available to me I can take you into considerable levels of trans-personal energy. But there's some levels I can't take you into. 

01:09:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Now that seems like an important phrase. If you have that level in you. 

01:09:40
HAL STONE Exactly. You have to think of voice dialogue, think, think of a violin. No, that's too scratchy. A piano, okay here's a piano between us. It's just, it's a box with strings and so forth, right. But now we are going to train somebody to play the piano. Okay. I like to think of voice dialogue not so much as uh, a therapy tool, as a tool for training artist. Because as you do the work you become more sensitive and you become more and more finely tuned to the different energies. And whenever you met an energy you can't handle then you have to go into that energy in yourself. It's a never ending process, you see. But if I don't have available in me, my own sense of vulnerable child I can't connect to yours, he'll go away. He'll disappear. Or he'll say I don't want to be here. Or your protector controller will take over and stop the work because it recognizes that I don't have it available. 

01:10:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So, you're process is as therapist, you're not just being therapist, you're being a wide range of energies, even as you sit there. 

01:10:55
HAL STONE I'm operating on a multi-dimensions of consciousness. I'm operating with my awareness, my aware ego, all the different selves that are operating in me, that touch your selves, and I'm also handling all the different selves in you. Some of which we talked to and others that I'm aware of. So, it's a fairly wide gambit of energetic connection that's going on. 

01:11:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And you mentioned, you might have say, with my ordinary self, my vulnerable self spent a lot of time just in silence. 

01:11:30
HAL STONE Oh, we might, we might sit, the, the vulnerable child is a very amazing energy. I mean it's a very amazing kid. I have sat for hours with such a child. A remember one man who sat in an easy chair in the office and he, he would stay there for 20 minutes without me seeing him and then he'd peak out to see if I was still there, like this, back. 

01:11:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:11:55
HAL STONE Another 20 minutes. It's the part of us that's the most starved, you know. In the growing up process that's the one that really takes a beating. And it's particularly sad because that child is the basis of intimacy in human relationship. without that child you cannot touch deeply with another person. And it's that child also that is hurt in relationship that causes most of the fights of relationship. Most of the wars of relationship happen because your feelings are hurt. And you either don't know it or can't communicate it. How much time do we have left now? 

01:12:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Oh, I think there's probably about 10, 10 minutes. 

01:12:45
HAL STONE Okay. Um, I thought it might be nice to turn the tables and why don't you work with me for just a couple of minutes. 

01:12:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Now, that brings out my vulnerable child. 

01:12:55
HAL STONE Uh, I'm sure it does, but I think you can handle it with your experience. Just do it, just a couple of parts. I'd just like to show you that you could learn this that quickly. 

01:13:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE All right. 

01:13:05
HAL STONE Okay. Uh, are you curious about any part of me? Uh, is there any uh, otherwise I, you know. 

01:13:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I know a few things about you. You, you mentioned at one time that before you began doing the voice dialogue work you, you had a, a very professional control sense. 

01:13:25
HAL STONE Dr., Dr. Stone. 

01:13:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Dr. Stone, hiding with a vulnerability. 

01:13:25
HAL STONE Yes. He was very good though, I must tell you. He did work, Dr. Stone. 

01:13:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE He was very successful? 

01:13:30
HAL STONE Yes, yes absolutely. 

01:13:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Could we talk to Dr. Stone. 

01:13:35
HAL STONE Oh, yes, yes. 

01:13:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

01:13:40
HAL STONE I'm still here. 

01:13:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Dr. Stone. 

01:13:40
HAL STONE Yes. 

01:13:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE A pleasure to talk to you. 

01:13:45
HAL STONE Yeah.I would like to clearly establish the fact that I have never died, and that I remain here, and when he comes here in an evening like this, I am present in the background. 

01:13:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:13:55
HAL STONE So, that if he can't handle things I will appear. 

01:14:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. We can always, we can always. 

01:14:00
HAL STONE Take over. 

01:14:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We can always get into a technical discussion with you. 

01:14:05
HAL STONE Oh, yes. Well, for example, let's say that you would do something that would upset him. 

01:14:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:14:10
HAL STONE Or threaten him or hurt him in some way. 

01:14:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:14:10
HAL STONE And if he couldn't handle that, you know, if, with his awareness, if he couldn't handle that with you. I would jump in and I would cover it over and I would, you know. Now you would probably know if I came out. 

01:14:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:14:25
HAL STONE Because you're pretty sensitive. But another person wouldn't even know I was there. I sit straighter, I, my face is tighter, I have a mind like a sword. I think quickly. So, I'm always in the background, should he need me. I used to be there all the time, but. 

01:14:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You, you serve a protective function for him? 

01:14:45
HAL STONE Yes, yes. 

01:14:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:14:45
HAL STONE Doctors are very important. As long as I'm a doctor you're not a doctor. Except your a doctor so it doesn't work. But uh, you know, us doctors are very important. 

01:14:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. And I gather he even today still needs you. 

01:15:00
HAL STONE Oh, yes, absolutely. Now, this is, this is Hal talking now. 

01:15:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

01:15:05
HAL STONE So, you want to move quickly. 

01:15:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

01:15:05
HAL STONE But you got the jest of that already. 

01:15:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. different energy. 

01:15:10
HAL STONE And the flavor of it. Total different energy. Okay. 

01:15:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

01:15:10
HAL STONE So, who, let's go to the other side. Um, the child. 

01:15:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes, may I, may I talk to the child again. 

01:15:20
HAL STONE We're going to bypass the ego this time, okay. Right to the child. 

01:15:25
[sil.] 

01:15:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hi there. How, how old are you? 

01:15:45
[sil.] 

01:15:45
HAL STONE Oh, I'm around uh, I'm around 9 or 10. 

01:15:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. Are you happy with him? 

01:15:55
HAL STONE I am now. 

01:15:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:16:00
HAL STONE Yeah, he uh, uh, he knows how to take care of me now. 

01:16:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. He takes you around with him? 

01:16:05
HAL STONE Well, he moved to the country. 

01:16:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:16:10
HAL STONE And uh, he has a lovely home in the country and uh, he uh. 

01:16:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Oh, I bet he plays with you. 

01:16:20
HAL STONE We, we have a lot of fun. We uh, every night is free, and we go to the gymnasium. And we soak in the, the sauna. And he takes naps which I love. And we go for walks and he has a lot of time for me now. He didn't use to have a lot of time for me. 

01:16:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE He used to spend more time with Dr. Stone. 

01:16:45
HAL STONE Well, he's been pretty busy in his life and I didn't, I didn't get much. 

01:16:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:16:55
HAL STONE So I feel, I'm pretty happy now. 

01:17:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, it's real nice to met you. 

01:17:00
HAL STONE Yeah. He let me out because, because your kid came out. But he would never let me out unless he knew the other person was safe. And people's whose kids don't come out aren't safe, as far as I'm concerned. 

01:17:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Well, I, I bet our, our kids would like each other. 

01:17:15
HAL STONE Oh yeah. 

01:17:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE My kid would like you. 

01:17:15
HAL STONE I like those jokes that you were telling before. They were a lot of fun, I like jokes. 

01:17:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

01:17:25
HAL STONE I like to laugh. 

01:17:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah, yeah. That's nice. 

01:17:25
HAL STONE Hal's calling back. 

01:17:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

01:17:30
HAL STONE Go back to Hal. 

01:17:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Interesting. Now, I bet you also have like a feminine side. 

01:17:35
HAL STONE Oh yeah. 

01:17:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

01:17:35
HAL STONE Of course. 

01:17:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Would that, that. 

01:17:40
HAL STONE The, the, we are microcosms(ph) of the microcosm. The whole world is in us. I have a feminine side in me. I have a killer in me. I have a Hitler in me. I have a Jew, I have Catholic in me. I have an anti-Semite in me. I have everything in me. 

01:17:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Every animal? What if I were to say object like, do you have a paper clip in you? 

01:18:00
HAL STONE No. I, I mean, uh. 

01:18:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's pushing it. 

01:18:05
HAL STONE That's pushing, yeah. Okay. What I mean is every uh, every uh, moving energy. 

01:18:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:18:10
HAL STONE You know, uh, every way of behaving, feeling, and thinking that exist in the world is a part of each of us. So, as I, as I work with you and your different parts and a thousand other people one tends to get less judgmental. 

01:18:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:18:25
HAL STONE Because what's to judge. The basis of this work really is that part is an energy, and there is no energy that is inherently good or bad. None. A killer isn't a bad energy. If I'm walking down the street and I have killer energy available to me, it depends how I use it. 

01:18:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:18:45
HAL STONE If I use it without awareness then it does damage. If I use it with awareness it gives me confidence. It, it means I can use that kind of energy if necessary and I'm not afraid. But if I use it without awareness then it hurts people. I'll attack people. I'll jump them. I'll judge them. I'll cut them up with my sword, you see. So all we're trying to do is, is become aware of all the different energies and learn how to use all those energies with awareness. And that creates really a new kind of person. That's a renaissance person. And that's what I feel we're all in today is this process of all becoming renaissance people. 

01:19:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Do you think that in the uh, new consciousness, new age movement there's some confusion with the various sub-personalities. Is sometimes may be being overly revered or, or treated as more divine or, or somehow different or special or more authoritative. 

01:19:40
HAL STONE, PhD, Co-author, Embracing Our Selves 

01:19:45
HAL STONE Well, every uh, uh, every system, every therapy system um, idolizes its own primary selves and uh, if you're a committed uh, uh, if you, if you're committed to Bunker psychology whatever that is then you're going to worship the selves that are connected to Bunker psychology. Uh, that's a perfectly natural process. But more and more therapist today are stepping away from the primary selves and beginning to embrace the other selves. Which means they're beginning to embrace the other systems. Voice dialogue is not a therapy system. It can be used my anyone who does any kind of work. And we insist that it be used that way. Do not certify people to do voice dialogue, anybody can use it. 

01:20:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Are there certain safeguards? 

01:20:35
HAL STONE The main safeguard is really to concentrate on the work of the primary selves, that's what keeps it safe. It's going after disowned selves that gets you in trouble. Somebody comes in and says I'm filled with rage, I want to work with the demonic. I really want to let it out. I don't have to honor that person's need to let out the demonic. What I'm going to go after is I want to know who it is in that doesn't want the demonic to come out. That's the main safeguard in the system. Because as long as I work with the primary selves um, that's a protection it keeps the work safe. 

01:21:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words, what some schools of therapy traditionally call resistance. It must be in the course of therapy overcome in some way or another, or tricked. You seemed to be saying what we need to do is honor resistance. 

01:21:20
HAL STONE There's a wonderful fairy-tale in which the hero's trying to get out of the kingdom and there's a dragon. The dragon guards the people from getting out of the kingdom. Okay. And the hero has to jump over the head of the dragon in order to get out of the kingdom. That dragon is the dragon of resistance. It doesn't let people leave. Resistance is a perfectly legitimate process. It protects people from going crazy. It's part of the primary self system that makes sure that all of your disowned selves don't come out at one time. Because if all of your disowned selves come out, you're in trouble. Resistance is just a voice, just an energy and it needs to be regarded and honored and revered as any other part. So, just a very important part that has to be, be made aware of and uh, you know, worked with. 

01:22:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PhD 

01:22:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE What about in a situation where the therapist finds that they're becoming a little bit intimidated by one of the voices. That they're getting judgmental or developing a strong emotional reaction. 

01:22:20
HAL STONE It happens all the time, it's a perfectly natural part of the process. If they can't handle the situation they stop the work and uh, go back to the ego place. They simply talk things over. Depending on the sophistication of the client the therapist can let the client know what happened or not. And then the therapist simply finds somebody to work with him or her and to work with whatever was troubling them. 

01:22:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:22:45
HAL STONE So if they're, if they start judging a very vulnerable part it means somewhere that week they have to work with somebody who can work with their vulnerability and their judgment. So they get a hold of it. And it's that simple. That's a part of the process. Nobody can be fully conscious, it's not possible. 

01:23:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So, voice dialogue in a sense is a continual process of awareness. Of becoming more aware. And I gather it's essential that the therapist see their own process as well as a continual one. 

01:23:15
HAL STONE Uh, it would be an essential condition that the therapist be involved in some way with their own uh, voice systems. Otherwise uh, it would be quite difficult to uh, energetically link into this array of selves in the clients they're working with. Yes, absolutely. It's a lot of fun. As a matter, if you're not having fun doing this work. you're not doing it right. You're trying to hard. It's that, we always tell that to people. 

01:23:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And, and when you use the term energetically linking in, I, we only have a minute left so I can't get into this in much detail but what I hear you saying is that although it's called a voice dialogue process. A great deal of it happens at the unspoken level. 

01:23:55
HAL STONE Absolutely. When I went into my child, you linked in immediately and hit my child. I could of stayed there for 10 hours. 

01:24:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:24:00
HAL STONE Because you linked immediately. 

01:24:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:24:05
HAL STONE Yeah. 

01:24:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And when you're linking like that even silently there may be a lot of work going on at many levels. 

01:24:10
HAL STONE There is and of course, the whole dream process cues in here. Which picks up the different parts and so forth. 

01:24:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. It's as if you're applying some kind of telepathic ability to the therapeutic process. 

01:24:25
HAL STONE It tends actually to make people more psychic and telepathic. It, it is an inevitable result of the ongoing use of the process. Yeah, it happens to everybody really. I think they become more sensitive. 

01:24:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, my para-psychologist is very pleased to hear you say that, Hal. And uh, we have just less than a minute left, may be 30 seconds. Uh, is there any other note you'd like to close on? 

01:24:55
[sil.] 

01:25:00
HAL STONE I think really the, the thing I said before is very important to us. As the voice dialogue begins to spread uh, as it is and that is to realize that it is not uh, a defined system of therapy. And that it is available to all schools of therapy and all schools of growth we have. We have body workers using it, Youngeans, Gestalt people, psycho-analytic people. I mean it's very important to us that it not get locked into cement. And uh, each person who uses it has a very uh, different style and our hope is that uh, it is not going to lock into a form as happens so easily with this kind of work. That what would be closing note and prayer, yeah. 

01:25:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well for a person who, who spends so much time focusing on, on the many selves that we have. It sounds like really genuinely a selfless contribution that you're making to the field of human growth and human potential, Hal. Let me thank you. 

01:26:00
HAL STONE Okay, thank you for having me. 

01:26:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. And thank you as well for being with us.
