DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating positive new habit and foundation to help you in your trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do their best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is, take a news break. I was reminded by a client today, that watching, reading and listening to the news can reignite trauma. Sometimes the best thing that we can do is do less of something you do all the time. This particular client had been exposed to many complex dramatic events, of an extreme nature and continued to watch, read, and listen to the news daily. As we all know, the news is filled with some pretty terrible stuff at times, and things happening thousands of miles away, today, as well as things in our own backyard can continue to reignite our own trauma stories, leaving us feeling swamped with posttraumatic symptoms. Ask yourself how much news are you taking in daily? Even if the news is just the headline from the web browser, it's enough to engage your fight for flight mechanism, and if you are feeling distressed, over things that are out of your control. So, for the day today's exercise is to avoid, really just stop exposure to news related trauma. Remember this a one day exercise, but hopefully it will set the pattern of limiting your exposure to trauma reminders through the media. Practice this again throughout the day, whenever you need to recapture feelings of comfort or calm. Take the time right now, to form a new practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
