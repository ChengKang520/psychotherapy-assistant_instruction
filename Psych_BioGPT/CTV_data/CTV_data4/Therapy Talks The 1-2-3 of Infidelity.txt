PAUL PELUSO Tiger Woods. What's the first thing you think of when you hear the name Tiger Woods? Chances are you no longer think about him being the most dominant player in the field of golf. You probably don't think about his 14 major championships. And you probably don't think about his one billion dollars worth of advertising and endorsement deals that he had. No, chances are you probably think about that night in November 2009 when he got into an accident and then his wife came to his rescue with a nine iron. And then of course we all know the story that happened after that. But it's not just people like Tiger Woods. People in politics. When you think of the name John Edwards, what do you think of? Probably not the fact that he was a third place runner up in the Iowa caucus in 2008. You probably don't think first of the fact that he was a vice presidential candidate in 2004. No, chances are you probably think of the fact that when his wife was diagnosed with stage four cancer, he was having a child with another woman. That's the issue with infidelity. It effects both the powerful and the popular who risk all kinds of public humiliation. But also it effects the everyday ordinary couple. And that's one of the reasons why we're going to talk about that here in this talk that I entitled “The 1-2-3 of Infidelity.” In this talk I'm going to talk with you about three important factors that you need to know about infidelity and working with couples in infidelity. So I'm gonna tell you one scary fact. I'm gonna tell you two important questions. And then I'm going to give you a three step road map for understanding infidelity. So let's start with the one scary fact. 

00:03:15
1 Scary Fact 

00:03:15
Couples Counselor Survey 

00:03:15
1.Most Common Presenting Concern 

00:03:15
2.Most Difficult Issue to Treat 

00:03:15
3.Least Prepared to Treat 

00:03:15
PAUL PELUSO  About 15 years ago a survey was sent out to couples' counselors and they were asked what was the most common presenting complaint that came into their offices. Their answer was- you guessed it, infidelity. Then they were asked what was the most difficult issue to treat. Again they answered infidelity. And then the third thing. They were asked what was the issue that they were least prepared to treat. The answer again; infidelity. Now this was repeated about 10 years later by another set of researchers. And you know what they found? The same exact thing. Infidelity was still the most common issue that couples' counselors were facing. It was still the most difficult one for them to treat. And it was the one that they felt least prepared to treat. 

00:04:05
This is what I call (Couples) 

00:04:05
Counseling's Dirty Little Secret. 

00:04:05
Most practitioners don't feel properly 

00:04:05
trained to deal with the most 

00:04:05
common complaint that walks 

00:04:05
through the door! 

00:04:05
This is CRAZY! It is like going to 

00:04:05
your doctor 

00:04:05
And she says that she can't treat 

00:04:05
the common cold! 

00:04:05
PAUL PELUSO Now this is something that I call couples' counseling's dirty little secret. And that is that most practitioners don't feel properly trained to deal with the most common complaint that walks through the door. Now that's crazy. That's kinda like going to your doctor with fever and sniffles and cough and sneezing, runny nose, achiness, and your doctor's saying, “Oh, I don't know how to treat that. That's really complicated.” And can't find any way of giving you some relief. So that's one of the reasons why I think that this training is important. So that's the one scary fact. Now one of the things that researchers have found is that to be effective in couples' counseling, dealing with infidelity, you have to do three things. 

00:04:45
To Be Effective Therapists Have To: 

00:04:45
1.Establish safety and trust 

00:04:45
2.Demonstrate competence 

00:04:45
3.Provide a road map 

00:04:45
PAUL PELUSO  One, you have to establish safety and trust in the therapy relationship. Then you have to demonstrate competence to the couple that you know how to help them. And third, giving them a road map to help them understand their experiences. 

00:05:00
2.Important Questions 

00:05:00
PAUL PELUSO  So now starting off with that establishing safety and trust, I'm going to give you two important questions that you should ask couples every time they come into therapy when they're dealing with infidelity. And it's actually the same question you ask both partners. And it goes something like this. 

00:05:20
First, And At Every Session 

00:05:20
Ask Both Partners The Following Question 

00:05:20
“HAVE YOU DECIDED WHETHER OR NOT 

00:05:20
TO STAY IN THE RELATIONSHIP?” 

00:05:20
PAUL PELUSO Have you decided whether or not to stay in the relationship? Let me say that again. Have you decided whether or not to stay in the relationship? Now you need to set this up of course before you go and ask that question. And walking clients through what that question means and what their answers mean is very important. Because you're not necessarily asking if they're going to stay or go in the relationship. Instead you're asking them if they've made that decision. And that decision gives them the power to be able to decide where they are in terms of their feelings, in terms of their concerns, in terms of their fears of being betrayed again. So it's an important question to ask both partners. Now if both partners say no, they haven't decided if they're going to stay or go into the relationship, well that allows you to focus more on the infidelity specific issues. Maybe there's still some ambivalence. Maybe there's still some concerns about what's going on in terms of safety and security and trusting the other person. If one person says yes, they have decided. Or if both people say yes they have decided, then you can follow that up with, “Okay, you've decided whether or not you're going to stay in the relationship. What is your decision?” If both or one says that they're going to stay in the relationship, then you can begin to move the therapy a little bit forward. If both of them say yes they're going to stay in the relationship, then you can continue to focus on more of the couple's based issues and start to move away from the infidelity issues. So those two important questions are very very powerful and very important if you want to do any kind of treatment or assessment of where the treatment needs to go. 

00:07:05
3.Three Step Model To Explain 

00:07:05
Infidelity 

00:07:05
1.Marital Satisfaction: 

00:07:05
The Stock Market of Love 

00:07:05
Paul Peluso, Ph.D. 

00:07:05
PAUL PELUSO  So we've gone through one scary fact and two important questions. Now I wanna talk to you about a three step model to explain infidelity. And this is the road map. The first of these is marital satisfaction or what I borrow from the work of John and Julie Godman when they talk about the stock market of love. And marital satisfaction is something like the stock market that goes up and down almost on a daily basis. Some days you're up five points. Some days you're down 20 points. Some days you're up 75 points. Some days you're down 150 points. And depending on where you wanna focus can tell you where you are in terms of relationship. In a relationship you're gonna have both ups and downs. But there's another way of looking at it as well. You can look at an overall trend line for the satisfaction of the relationship. You can look for how well the couple is feeling about each other. Is it an overall positive relationship or is it an overall negative relationship? Now when it's an overall negative relationship that means satisfaction has dropped off. And that, I think is a precursor to infidelity. But there are a lot of relationships that don't have, that have poor or negative satisfaction but don't necessarily mean that infidelity is going to occur. So I think it's necessary but it's not sufficient, not yet. 

00:08:30
2.Power Imbalances: 

00:08:30
The “See-Saw” of Relationships 

00:08:30
PAUL PELUSO The second one are power imbalances in the relationship, or what I like to call the see-saw of relationships. So think about when you were a kid. And you played on a see-saw with a friend. Now if you were both about the same size and the same weight you had probably a pleasant little journey. You were able to go up and down pretty freely amongst each other. Now if you've ever done this when you're an adult and you're coming along with a child or you happen to be heavier than the other person, well then the balance goes something like this and one person is stuck down at the bottom, another person is stuck up at the top. And think about what it's like for those individuals. 

00:09:05
The “See-Saw” of Relationships: 

00:09:05
Power Imbalances 

00:09:05
PAUL PELUSO The person at the bottom is not really going anywhere. The person on the top, not really going anywhere. And I think relationships get into that imbalance and that can be problematic. So let's take an issue like finances. Say one partner is making all of the money in the relationship or one partner is bringing home a bigger paycheck. Well they might feel like they have a greater say or they may feel like they have a greater responsibility for the financial health of the relationship. Well the other spouse or the other partner who might not be bringing in as much may feel like they're kinda stuck. They're at the whim of that other person. So they may try to find some way of re-balancing that relationship, if they feel like they're stuck up in the air. This could be translated into forming alliances with family members or with children or it's also an opportunity where an affair can re-balance that relationship. So that's the second one. But you know what? There are a lot of couples who have overall negative satisfaction. And there are couples who have overall power imbalances in their relationship. But that doesn't necessarily equate into having an affair. Having an affair occurs, I think, when the third thing happens. 

00:10:25
3.Dreams Denied: Fantasies, 

00:10:25
Hopes, 

00:10:25
& Wishes Unfulfilled 

00:10:25
PAUL PELUSO  And I believe that happens when there are dreams that are denied or fantasies or hopes or wishes that go unfulfilled. So what does that mean? Well, every relationship begins with an implicit bargain, with an implicit agreement between the two members. And it usually goes along some sort of emotional need that needs to be met. Keep me safe. Keep me secure. Make me feel special. Make me feel powerful. Make me feel loved. And if you do that for me then I will give you your dream, your wish, your need. 

00:11:05
Dreams Denied: Fantasies, Hopes, 

00:11:05
& Wishes Unfulfilled 

00:11:05
PAUL PELUSO And what happens is that after a long enough period of time, or after some period of time, one of the two partners or both of the partners come to a conclusion. They realize that I am never going to get my needs met by my partner. No matter how hard I try, no matter how long I stick to it, they're not going to give me what I want and what I need. And I believe when that moment happens, when that dream is denied or dies or that fantasy, it becomes realized that it's not gonna come true, I believe that's when the door opens to an infidelity. And I believe that's when one or both partners may walk through that door. And I think those are the three necessary and sufficient conditions where an infidelity occurs. Where there's overall marital satisfaction and where there are power imbalances in the relationship, and where they believe that their dream, their hope, their wish for the relationship will not be fulfilled and not come through. And what I found is that when you, when you relate that to couples, when you walk them through those three steps, that road map, they're able to see where their relationship came to be here in an infidelity. And that begins to really work on establishing that safety and trust. It demonstrates that comp. And it also provides them with that road map. Because from that you can begin to plan treatment to get them out of there if they've decided to stay in the relationship. 

00:12:35
1-2-3 of Infidelity 

00:12:35
1.One Scary Fact 

00:12:35
2.Two Questions to Ask 

00:12:35
3.Three Step Model to Explain 

00:12:35
PAUL PELUSO  So those are, from my point of view, the one two threes of infidelity. It's one scary fact, that couples' counselors don't feel prepared and don't feel very well trained to work with infidelity. It's two important questions. Have you decided whether or not to stay in the relationship? And then it's a three step road map for understanding infidelity. And I would encourage you to think about employing some of these the next time you're working with a couple in counseling for infidelity. Thank you very much.

00:13:20
THERAPY Talks 

00:13:20
SHANNON DERMER Thank you for that presentation. I was actually thinking about some of our curriculum here at Governor State University and other universities I've been at in supervision. And I was thinking we don't talk a lot or as much as we should about how to work with infidelity. Why do you think that is? 

00:13:35
Paul Peluso, Ph.D. 

00:13:35
PAUL PELUSO  I think it's because up until recently we really haven't studied it very well. We really haven't tried to provide really good conceptual frameworks for understanding infidelity and we haven't done a really good job of articulating a good model for working through infidelity. 

00:13:55
SHANNON DERMER What do you think will change that? 

00:14:00
PAUL PELUSO I think it's already starting to change. I think that the field is demanding it because of those statistics, that it's the most common problem that's walking through the door. And I think it's happening more and more and more. I also think that people are starting to pay attention to it as a research focus. In fact I'm gonna be working with Doctor John and Julie Gotman on doing a research trial on Gotman couple's therapy for infidelity. 

00:14:25
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:14:25
SHANNON DERMER Great. Cause they mostly focus on how to help people have a happy, long term relationship. So is the focus with the three of you gonna be how to get back to a happy long term relationship after infidelity? 

00:14:40
PAUL PELUSO Yes, it's gonna be focusing both on how to help resolve that betrayal and how to help resolve the damage that's done to the relationship and then move them back towards a happier, more satisfying relationship. 

00:14:55
SHANNON DERMER That's true. Doesn't, they know focus in on trust as one of the key elements of a good relationship. Don't they? 

00:15:00
PAUL PELUSO Yes. It's absolutely essential. And of course in infidelity, that's one of the most painful things is that trust is betrayed. But what I found is that while a lot of times it is just one person who is kinda caught out of the blue by their partner cheating on them, when you work with a couple on some of those road maps steps that I was talking about, a lot of times they could see the precursors to it and they could see where from a system's perspective both partners created the conditions where the infidelity could occur. 

00:15:30
SHANNON DERMER  Now I have to admit while you were talking I was thinking of some other presentations on infidelity. Does that mean I cheated on you? I'm sorry. But actually I do wanna be talking about the definition of that before we go on. What is the definition of infidelity? 

00:15:50
Paul Peluso, Ph.D. 

00:15:50
PAUL PELUSO That's a great question. And I think the definition of infidelity is whatever the couple brings in and decides is infidelity. I don't think that it's my place to play referee and decide, oh that was infidelity or that was not infidelity. Some people will say if you cross the sexual boundary. That's infidelity right there. Other folks will say there's emotional infidelity and there's cyber infidelity. I think that the road map that I presented applies to any of those kinds of infidelities that you might find. So I try not to get into that too much. 

00:16:30
SHANNON DERMER Well I had heard a very simple definition one time that was that it had to be a secret and that it had to take some kind of resources, whether that's time, money, whatever away from the couple. And usually you don't keep something secret unless you know that it's something that your partner or spouse isn't going to agree to or be uncomfortable with. So I think that does leave room for them to define it. Cause I've had couples come in where a kiss was infidelities, where going out to lunch with someone of the opposite sex without telling your spouse, that that was considered cheating. And then other people had to be, you were having sex with someone else. 

00:17:10
PAUL PELUSO Yeah. I remember I had a couple where it was just you're receiving texts from another woman was enough to make the partner feel so insecure and so concerned about it that they wound up coming for couples counseling. So again, I think it really does depend on what the couple chooses to define it. And I think that that again opens the doors for a lot of different possibilities. 

00:17:30
SHANNON DERMER  Do you think that most couples have had that overt conversation of the continuum of this is infidelity or this is cheating? Or do you think most of them just assume a definition? 

00:17:45
PAUL PELUSO More often than not, no, they haven't had that conversation. And I think that there's even a broader context to it. You mentioned the issue of trust, also the issue of betrayal. And I think that having a broader conversation about what does that mean to you to violate trust? What would that mean to our relationship? How would that make me feel? How would that make you feel? I think that those are actually healthy conversations for couples to have, usually in good moments and better moments in their relationship. But especially if they're having some fears or some doubts, I think it's really really important to have those. 

00:18:25
SHANNON DERMER Right. Cause there could be a violation of trust before they actually define it as infidelity. But I guess that road that you were talking about may feel like it's leading toward that path. 

00:18:35
PAUL PELUSO And more often than not where there's that betrayal or that mistrust, it usually comes down to having some power imbalance. I don't trust you to treat me equally. Or it comes down to a sense of I'm not getting my deeper needs met here and I don't know how to tell you that. And I don't know how to give voice to that. Sometimes they just don't even know that that's what's occurring to them. But when you bring that issue up to them, they're able to attach some significance to it. 

00:19:05
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:19:05
SHANNON DERMER It was interesting when you said that the wishes and fantasies and desires, I remember supervising one case where the husband ended up leaving the relationship because he said, ”I want to feel admired by my spouse and I just know I'm not gonna get that.” And they've been married for years, had kids together. And he just wanted to and ended up being with someone a little bit younger who he just felt like really admired him and respected him. And his wife was going, “Admire and respect you? Three kids and I'm not gonna take the time to make you feel like a rock-star.” But that's what he wanted was to feel admired by his spouse. And I think after a while he finally figured out I'm never going to get that in this relationship. 

00:19:50
PAUL PELUSO  And that can be a very painful conversation to have. That can be a very difficult realization to come to. And if they're able to do that earlier on in the relationship, maybe they can sort it out, maybe they can't. In this case the person couldn't. 

00:20:05
SHANNON DERMER  So now you supervise and you're also, you teach and you present on this topic. What do you find that counselors in training or therapists in training have the most difficulty with with this topic? 

00:20:20
Paul Peluso, Ph.D. 

00:20:20
PAUL PELUSO I think more than anything else, they have difficulty with the very strong emotions that are aroused in the couples' session when there's infidelity. Particularly if they just discovered it or if as more often than not, couples will come in with a different problem, maybe generic communication issues or something, and then the infidelity is revealed afterwards. And so then dealing with that raw hurt, that raw emotion. And I think the one thing that they do that's I think the biggest problem or setback to couples counseling is they try to tamp down that emotion. They're worried that that's gonna be a contagion in fact and it's gonna really be problematic for the therapy. And I believe the opposite. I think that that emotion, all of that is the fuel for the engine of change in the couple. And I think that when couples' counselors don't feel comfortable with those difficult emotions then it becomes a real problem for the therapy to move forward. 

00:21:25
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So it sounds like then some of your supervision focuses on that process of discussing infidelity but some of your supervision is going to focus in on what it brings up for, all of that raw emotion brings up for the clinician in training. 

00:21:40
PAUL PELUSO Absolutely. Absolutely. I think that that is important regardless of whether or not you're seeing couples for infidelity. It's just being comfortable with your own emotional arousal in the presence of the strong emotion of clients because we're all going to experience that. The question is what do we do with it? And I think that it just becomes heightened, not just times two because there's two people there. I think it's probably a factor of ten that it becomes amplified because the emotion is so strong and so raw, particularly when it's driven by betrayal. 

00:22:10
SHANNON DERMER Okay. What from your experience when you're supervising people working with infidelity, or from your research and writing, what are the common errors that you might see clinicians make when they're working with infidelity? 

00:22:25
PAUL PELUSO Yeah, I think that there's, I think there's two common errors. I think one error that clinicians make is just sometimes they miss the obvious. And I'm speaking from personal experience. When earlier on in my career when I was not as sensitive to the issues of infidelity, couples would come in and they would come in with generic communication issues but the therapy never seemed to be going anywhere. It seemed to be stuck. And that was because either one or both people knew about the infidelity but kept it secret. And I think of one case in particular where it wasn't until a year later when the husband came back to see me individually that he said, “Oh by the way I didn't know it and I guess you didn't either but all the while we were in counseling as a couple, my wife was seeing somebody else.” And then when I looked back on it there were probably some very obvious cues that I missed. I think a lot of times couples' counselors don't go deep enough or they miss the obvious. And then the second one is I think they don't go deep enough. Sometimes we're, again, concerned about those emotions, we wanna keep things on the surface, we wanna work on tasks and projects and on things that we think move the therapy along forward. But as a result, not that those aren't important, but we sacrifice some of the deeper issues and the areas of real connection for couples. In particular when it comes to infidelity, there is a very large disconnect there. And part of our job is if the couple wants to move forward on that, is to help them reconnect. 

00:24:00
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:24:00
SHANNON DERMER Good. Now I'm thinking back to a case that where there actually hadn't been intercourse with someone else but the husband had gotten caught trying to basically pick someone else up. And it ended up being a big thing that the whole family knew about. I won't go into the details but the whole family knew about it. So there was that added pressure that the family knew about the attempted infidelity. The wife had been pregnant at the time which added to the betrayal. And the husband had actually called in cause all of a sudden he was scared that he was gonna lose his wife and she was very upset obviously. And I remember struggling to think sometimes how much should I focus in on that incident, how much should I focus in on trust in general or here going forward how he could... She had said that she did wanna work staying married, they had two young children but that obviously her trust had been broken, so working on the trust. And him having to do basically whatever it takes to get the trust back. But then also one of the reasons he claimed that he was looking for sex elsewhere was there was some problems in their sex life. So I was trying to figure out, which is the most, I started with trust first cause I said we could get to these other, we had to start on trust first. But the idea of focusing in the actual incident, trust, or some of the issues that may have led up to or contributed to, I don't wanna, contributed to him looking for sexual relationships in other places. How do you help people decide which one to focus in on first? 

00:25:50
PAUL PELUSO Well, I can think of two things in particular. One is just some of the research that's been done on it. So very limited research studies have been done on it, show that if you focus on just the infidelity the outcome rates are not as good as if you focus on both the infidelity and the underlying couple's dynamic issues. So that's something that I encourage students and supervisors to definitely keep in mind that you have to work both of them. But then I think for me I always try to start off with those wishes, those dreams and that bargain, that deal that the couple struck. And if they can't meet the old arrangement, can they start to come up with a new dream to work on together? Or be able to articulate what it is they need now from each other. And I think that becomes a very good starting place for helping both people to begin to protect that relationship again and move forward. 

00:26:45
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:26:45
SHANNON DERMER  Good. You talked about dreams a little bit. I know that fits with the Gotman model. I'd be very interested to see what you all come up with with how to help people heal from that. And John and Julie Gotman are usually pretty good at, I think it's helpful for clinicians sometimes because they usually give pretty clear steps for helping. So is that your goal then? To kind of find some clear steps to helping people come back from an infidelity? 

00:27:20
Paul Peluso, Ph.D. 

00:27:20
PAUL PELUSO Yeah. I think that that would be very important for clinicians to have that, but also for clients to have that, to know that there's a road map out of there. So the other half of the one two threes would be a three two one, I think, where you would start with those dreams and those wishes, then you look for those power and balances and how can they start to rebalance those. And then start to look on how do you deal with the ups and downs of everyday marital satisfaction. And I think that kinda provides a generic road map for getting out of infidelity. Now how quickly you do that with a couple, that's gonna vary on the couple themselves. 

00:27:55
SHANNON DERMER And we only have like a minute or two left. But I wanted to ask you since there isn't a lot of research out there and a lot of writing out there, just what model do you tend to use, what counseling or therapy model do you tend to use when you're working with couples in infidelity? 

00:28:10
PAUL PELUSO  Sure. So I was trained as an Adlerian. So I use a lot of Adlerian approaches. I also was trained by Gus Napier in the symbolic experiential family therapy approach. So I see a lot of the person of the counselor in there. And then I also borrow a lot from Gotmans' approach. 

00:28:30
SHANNON DERMER Great. Time all of a sudden went out. So thank you for that very succinct description of your approach. And I wanna thank you for everything that you taught us today. I think that's a great topic and one that we all need to learn more about. I wanna thank all of you for joining us today for this talk about infidelity. If you'd like to know more about Doctor Paul Peluso or about the other therapy talks please visit the Alexander Street Press website. So thank all of you and thank you for that fascinating talk.
