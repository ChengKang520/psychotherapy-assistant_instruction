JANINA FISHER Hello and welcome to Trauma and the Body. Today, we are going to be talking about my very favorite subject which is the neurobiological legacy of trauma and attachment failure. And we're gonna be talking about what that means in terms of the therapist's ability to work with the imprint of trauma and attachment failure on the body. You know Bessel van der Kolk whom I've known for many, many years uh… as many of you know umm… because of his book the Body keeps the score and his many, many articles over the years. Umm… he, he was always intrigued by the nature of traumatic memory, the fact that it didn't conform to the way we remember most other things. He wrote the post traumatic syndrome is the result of a failure of time to heal all wounds. So true, isn't it. The memory of the trauma is not integrated and accepted as a part of one's personal past. Instead, it is disassociated and when this occurs, a particular event or series of events can alter people's psychological, biological and social equilibrium to such a degree that the memory of the trauma comes to taint all other experiences. And that's really what led him to his discovery of the tremendous role the body plays in, in literally engraving traumatic experiences in our brains. You know, having a trauma lens becomes increasingly important. With each passing year, I've been in private practice for 34 years and part of the trauma treatment communities for 25 years and never more than at this period in history have therapist needed a trauma lens. We need that understand the scope is this cartoon illustrate so well that allows us to make sense of the confusing, often paradoxical symptoms that traumatize individuals whether umm… traumatized by political trauma terrorism umm… mugging, rape or childhood abuse and neglect and I should also add come back too. Now when we take a history, we have to remember that a trauma is relative. The more vulnerable we are, the more impact events have on us. And there is a whole body of literature that shows for example, the attachment literature that frightened and frightening caregiving. Parents who researchers observed to be frightening or to appear frightened result in the same symptoms as abuse. The same with neglect. (inaudible )Perry has spent many, many years studying brain development in neglected and abused children. He can attest to that. There is a literature on being a witness to violence that shows that even if one is not the victim, being a witness to violence has a traumatic effect. Uh… and that of course means that often parental fighting umm… violent words, violent expressions uh… throwing of objects can have a traumatic effect on very young children. Words and behavior, I'll kill you umm… you know as adults we know that the parents who say, I'm gonna kill you umm… rarely actually kill the children. But if you're two or three or four or five, you don't know. Rachel (inaudible )has done an absolutely extraordinary piece of research on intergenerational effects of parental PTSD using Holocaust survivors and their adult children and she very elegant, elegantly divided the adult children into two groups. One group who had their own trauma in childhood, the other group who had no exposure to trauma and what she found was that regardless of the trauma status of the adult children, if the parents had PTSD, the child was statistically likely to have PTSD. All kinds of medical trauma and accidents, surgeries, umm…, you know children born with birth defects, cardiac problems, cystic fibrosis, the treatments for which are very, very traumatic, both psychologically and physically. And then something that again we think of as horrific but not necessarily traumatic, the death of a parent or a parent figure. Umm… because for young children, parents equal safety. The death of a parent means one is no longer so safe in the world. Now trauma is the term we use for events and you know, it's really, it's really important that we don't confuse traumatic impact with traumatic events. So when we talk about trauma, we are referring to a series of events but we're also referring to the legacy of those events which can differ person to person and I've been calling at lately a living legacy because I found that my clients to really get. You know, sometimes I joke with them and I say, remember trauma is the gift that I'm giving. And we get a good laugh out of that. Again the right moment, the right client uh… because some clients might be upset to hear the trauma refer to in that way. But most of my clients are really find it helpful to have a lighter perspective toward those very, very heavy experiences. So the living legacy of trauma, the effects, the day-to-day moment to moment, hour to hour experience of our clients for decades after the events are over. So here we see the traumatic event but that's just an event and were there not a legacy, we would say oh that's tragic. What a horrific experience this child went through? Thank God it's over and this person is okay now. But for our clients, what we see is a legacy of symptoms, depression umm… irritability, umm… numbing and loss of interest, umm… all kinds of symptoms that we usually associate with depression as well as symptoms we associate with PTSD as well as the anxiety disorders when someone presents with an anxiety disorder in my practice, I, one of the questions, I have in the back of my mind is, is this an anxiety disorder that represents the living legacy of trauma. Umm… chronic pain disorders, somatisation disorder umm… eating disorders, addictive disorders, suicidality and self-harm and one that's not on the slide but is very important borderline personality disorder. It is also associated with trauma. Now, this, this slide is the first page on my publication, the psycho education of flip chart. Umm… which is umm… sold on the Pesi website as well as umm… from my own and this is the page that I often show to clients, the first time I meet them. Because I don't want to take a history and potentially overwhelm them when we've just met and they don't yet feel safe with me. So this is a way that we can talk about trauma without activating its elements. So I ask, first I show them the page and then I ask them to notice what looks familiar? And, and it's always very, it's a lovely moment because there are people who joke, who say, well let me just tell you the ones I don't have. Umm… there are those who say wow, I thought all these symptoms meant something was wrong with me. But you're saying it's the trauma and there is almost a jubilation. Oh my gosh, these are not black marks. They are symptoms. And then I ask a question which sometimes confuses therapists but it's interesting, it rarely confuses clients. I ask and how did the depression help you survive and they say things like oh, it was my cocoon, it was my cave, I just hid in my cave. It was like a buffer that helped separate me from what was going on. How about irritability, how did the irritability help you to survive? 90% of the hundreds of clients to whom I've asked that question have said the irritability helps me to push people away which I always get such a kick out of because I of course like you all are one of those people who gets pushed away by the irritability. How about loss of interest, how did that help you survive? Oh, then, they couldn't talk anything away from me. Because I didn't care anyway. It didn't matter. I've lost interest. It didn't matter what they took away. And how about numbing, how did that help you survive? Well, then I didn't feel anything. And that's about as far as I usually go because I just want them to get a feel for the lens through which they and I are going to see their symptoms that this legacy represents how they survived in the face of the unsurvivable. And, and it also says, this is not a pathological model. This is really, this is really a an adaptation model because the human mind and the human body was designed to be self-repairing, self-sustaining and all you know, kind of like a plant, always seeking sunlight and water and air and uh…, and it's a really, you know, many people asked therapist, isn't you're a very depressing specialty and I think not at all. Not at all. Umm… because we, we everyday, we get to appreciate the incredible will to survive and thrive in our clients. Despite what has happened to them. Now, we might ask, why is it that our clients develop symptoms rather than memories? Umm… and it's a really interesting question. Part of the reason, excuse me is because of the nature of traumatic events. They're by definition a traumatic event is too much to process. It's too much to tolerate, too much to bear that's why we have clients reporting floating up to the ceiling or umm… or disassociating and they say well, I don't remember what happened after that. This, this uh… slide shows how memory despite all of our jokes about memory is actually not an area in the brain. All these different areas you see here represent different storage areas for different types of information. It's actually, it's very validating slide for those of us who are getting older because it, it really illustrates how much information has to come together to remember something. Now, let's talk a little bit about the brain and especially looking at it from the point of view of its development in childhood because such a large percentage of our clients are clients who either had umm… quite traumatic attachment failures in childhood. Umm… or abuse and neglect. So we are getting use and outmoded brain model, the trying brain of Paul McClain that is really the best model for therapy and trauma therapy especially because the trying brain very conveniently divides the brain into three sections. How very nice, I can remember, three sections of the brain, even when I'm working with the client. So, so it's very user friendly clients can remember and I can translate it for kids. So the theory says we all start out life with a very simple what Paul McClain called reptilian brain and you see this in little babies. It's the part of the brain that controls heart rate, breathing, I mean, what are we most concerned about when a baby is born? Will the heart and lungs work well? Will, will this baby be all right? The reptilian brain also drives our instinctive responses from the startle response all the way to bigger responses like fight, flight, submit and freeze. You know, think about a lizard uh… that's really with the reptilian brain is in charge of. Our a lizard life. And then about two and a half, three months of age, oh and of course the reptilian brain doesn't have language. Its, its language is action and impulse. And then about two and a half, three months of age, something wonderful happens for new parents. Baby suddenly becomes very social little creatures. You bend over to pick a baby up and there is this huge smile and eyes sparkling and all kinds of, of wiggles and giggles and whooing noises and all of the parent's fatigue vanishes in the light of that smile. And that's a sign that the baby's limbic system or mammalian brain is growing. The, you know, we really should talk about therapy as therapy for the limbic system because that's what people come to us for the most part complaining about. The limbic system drives emotion. It is the memory center for emotional experience and also the memory center for relationship and attachment experience. So very, very important area of the brain. And the mammalian brain or limbic system speaks the language of emotion and again, it's a non-verbal, what we call a sub cortical part of the brain and it, it's the part of the brain that brings us the emotions that we try to help the clients put language to. It is the pre-frontal cortex that finally brings us in an area where we can use verbal language and we can sequence, we can have a way to analyze cause and effect. You know, the reptilian brain and the limbic system are not that interested in cause and effect. They're interested in safety and in the case of the reptilian brain and emotional well-being in the case of the limbic system. The frontal cortex umm… brings a whole new uh… world to us and if you, if you raise children or been around children, you see this shift in them around 11, 12, 13 where the pre-frontal cortex becomes more and more where they hang out. They have, they like to have more conversation, they like to analyze things, they like projects, and uh…, and the frontal cortex also brings something very important which is the ability to learn from experience, to put to into together for example, to conceptualize why we might have done something impulsive. Umm… by the way for those of you who work with children, umm… remember a why question, something therapists, love to ask. We love those why questions is really not meaningful to the brain until kids are 12 and up. So, we have to be very careful about asking why questions before children have a brain capable of, of being able to formulate the answer to a why question. Now, let's imagine that this growing developing brain oh and I forgot to tell you something very important. The pre-frontal cortex continues to mature until we're 25 and, and sometimes over which is something that's very reassuring for those who work with kids at adolescence because as the pre-frontal cortex grows in, they're more and more capable of insight, of being able to regulate and choose, their actions of being able to use judgment. Umm… and it's a really wonderful thing. Now, let's talk about what happens? So here is our, our trying brain. What happens when that brain is exposed to threat which of course in the case of abuse and neglect, there is a kind of constant threat because after all a child only knows I will be hurt, I will molested not necessarily when. So when the body and brain perceive threat, the threat information is relayed to the medulla, the brain's smoke detector and fire alarm. And umm… and the brain is designed for the medulla and the pre-frontal cortex to communicate, to determine, is this a real danger or is it a reminder of a past danger. The more trauma we've had, the more threat we've been exposed to, the more sensitized medulla becomes, in fact brain scientists call it an irritable medulla and I just get such a kick out of it. Right, so the brain, the medulla becomes irritable with repeated exposure to threat and danger and umm… and more and more it starts to go off without checking with the pre-frontal cortex to see if the threat is really a threat. Then something very, very important happens. When the medulla sounds the alarm, right, red alert, red alert, uh…trauma on the horizon, the pre-frontal cortex shuts down. Umm…, it's a, it makes sense, uh… you just have to think about uh… something like umm… one of the mass shootings in a movie theater umm… 9/11 and umm… and what people did in those situations was to react instinctively. To hit the floor, to run umm… and to run and run and run in the case of survivors of 9/11 umm… for hours literally. So when the alarm sounds, the frontal cortex is inhibited, so that we don't stand around thinking about what to do while we're using our lives. So it's a very brilliant, a brilliant emergency stress system, we have. And so imagine now, let's extrapolate from this that the medulla goes off not just when dad or mom comes with a stick or a belt but each time a child hears a footstep, hears the key in the lock, hears the car pulling up to the house. Umm… let's say that Sunday night, I remember treating a couple and the, the issue was that the father watched football on Sunday and if his team and I remember his team to this day, if his team the Pittsburgh Steelers did not win, the wife knew that she or one of her children was in for a beating. And so every Sunday you can imagine as the scores changed and the games went on her, her emergency response system, her medulla had to have been firing like crazy. Maybe they won at the last minute and then her body could calm but again each time the medulla is getting more irritable and more sensitized. Now, let's look at this emergency stress response. When the medulla sounds the alarm, it sends a neurochemical message uh… to the adrenals and we start to have a very quick and very large adrenaline release and there is a, there is a purpose to it because what adrenaline does is to increase heart rate and respiration, to speed oxygen to muscle tissue so that suddenly we have a surge of energy. We have the strength of superman. All other non-essential systems in the body are suppressed. You don't need to eat, you don't need to drink, you don't need to use the bathroom umm… and you certainly don't need to use your frontal lobes. The body is ready to flee or fight. And then the most remarkable step happens next. The brain takes the next step in preparation for apparently, for a successful fleeing or fighting. Because a release of cortisol then triggers the parasympathetic system which will help us to uh… rest and recover. So while we're still fighting, excuse me, the parasympathetic system is already getting ready to help us recover. But it does so in a way that might not seem like recovery and if you've ever been in a car accident, you've probably had some of this experience. Umm…, you know the adrenaline makes us calm, cool and collected and the feel, and we feel strong and powerful. The as soon as we are at the end of this event whatever it might be that cool, calm effect that cool, calm, collected feeling disappears and we start to shake, we might start to feel frightened, we might feel nauseous and, and we also might feel exhausted and depleted. That's the parasympathetic system metabolizing all that adrenaline and helping, it's almost like think of it's like hitting your brakes so hard your car shakes. Right, so there is a lot of reactivity in the body. The gastrointestinal system comes on with a bang and often not therapist have at one time in their careers or another umm… had clients who became nauseous in session. I've learnt when that happens, just to say, oh, you're having a parasympathetic response. It's just part of the living legacy. Umm… it actually means that your, your body is settling, your nervous system is saying, it's okay, it's over now. And it's interesting when I, when I explained it that way, the nausea just stops on a dime. It's really, it's really quite interesting and I had this wonderful client who says, do you know, you're the first therapist in who's office I have not vomited and I think to myself, let's keep it that way. The parasympathetic system also allows us two other survival alternatives necessary for children, for battered wives, prisoners of war, hostages anyone with no way out. Fighting and fleeing assume there is a way out. But we also have freeze and submission responses, right. Freezing like a deer in the headlights so that we fade into the background and uh… and total submission or death responses in which we collapse, we two numb, we are disconnected from our feelings. We our muscles feel weak and there is nothing we can do. That is actually a very important survival response necessitated again especially for those who have significantly less power or are physically weak. So you can see that this emergency stress paradigm is very, very similar to the diagnosis for post traumatic stress. In the sympathetic side of it, umm… we would have flashbacks, intrusive symptoms, umm… the sense of it happening all over again. In the parasympathetic side, clients would report feeling numb, dead inside, disconnected umm… and exhausted, just exhausted. Think about clients who oversleep and who reports hours and hours of their lives in bed. They are usually clients who are stuck at that parasympathetic state. Now, what happens next. You know, one would expect, it's over, now the brain creates a memory of it. But this is what it was really baffling to those of us in the field back in the early 90s, late 80s uh… when the trauma field began. Because traumatized clients did not have clear cut memories. They had flashes, they had flashbacks. They had dreams that seemed to be in keeping with the flashbacks. We now know that because of this phenomenon that all non-essential systems are shut down that the (inaudible )which we need to process memory is inhibited. Who needs to be remembering why you're fleeing and fighting. So and because the pre-frontal cortex shuts down, we lose our ability to witness. Now the ability to observe and witness is connected to the medial pre-frontal cortex right here. The fact shut down. We don't have the clear record that the same function would give us in another circumstance. So Bessel Van Der brain scan studies which then were confirmed by many, many years of brain scan studies following showed that when trauma survivors remember trauma the pre-frontal cortex shut down and the medulla, especially on the right side of the brain umm… became highly active. I think of it as the pre-frontal cortex shut down, the medulla umm… became like the fourth of July fire works. Slight exaggeration but it was a shocking result to those of us in the field because this, when this part of the brain goes, goes out as a power failure, umm… our narrative memory centers are right here in the left umm… pre-frontal cortex. If the pre-frontal cortex is shut down, the memory centers and the expressive language centers are not accessible. So and then the memories are included in the brain's smoke detector leaving the individual sensitive to even the tiniest, subtlest reminders of the traumatic events. Bessel wrote back in 2001, under conditions of extreme stress, there is a failure of memory processing which results in an inability to integrate incoming input into a coherent autobiographical narrative. Leaving the sensory elements of the experience, unintegrated and unattached, the sensory elements are then prone to return when a sufficient number of them are activated by current reminders. And what we sense have come to realize is that this return of the sensory elements is another gift of evolution. Because the sensory elements without words constitute what's called implicit memory. Meaning non-verbal memory. So exclusive memory is verbal memory, implicit is non-verbal. And the brain scan research conclusively demonstrated that traumatic memories are primarily implicit in nature. (inaudible )this is a problem because implicit memories, you know the feeling of fear, a feeling of shame or the feeling of anger do not carry with them the internal sensation that something is being recalled. We act, feel and imagine without recognition of the influenced of past experience on present reality. Bruce Acker(ph) who's work on memory, I admire greatly takes it one step further. He says emotional memory converts to past into an expectation of the future. So think of that, emotional memory converts to past into an expectation of the future and makes the worst experiences in our past persist as felt realities. (inaudible )sees this was the attempt of brain and body to protect us because if these, if we have implicit rather than nice narrative memories which don't activate the whole body, umm… what happens is that we feel a sense of alarm. So I remember, I had a client who worked in hospital. She had been abused umm… as a child umm… emotionally, physically and sexually by her father who is also a medical professional and one of her most, it seems like a small thing but if you think about it, it becomes bigger. She was having trouble at her job because she couldn't tolerate being on an elevator with men between the ages of about 35 to 60. And, and so often she would have to, she would get out in the elevator than a man would get on, she'd have to get off. Umm… it became very, very, very difficult for her. Now, you can see the way in which her body getting going, having this alarm go off when a man walks onto the elevator. It's simply trying to protect her from Godzilla. In her case, her experience of Godzilla was a medical professional of middle age and with whom one is trapped. And so that, that also meant that she couldn't date because I think at the time I saw her, she was in her mid-40s. So that pretty much took out all of the men that she might date. Umm… it was really very, it was a huge loss and very painful and embarrassing when she kept getting off the elevator. The human body and brain, I'm trying to remember, I think it's Bruce Perry who says survival is the brain's imperative. We value our brain's for many, many things, we don't. I think, we take survival for granted. So in the wake of trauma, the body and brain become even more self-protective and one of the ways that, that happens is through a bias to all perceptual cues that have even a distant relationship to the trauma. And when we're exposed to those cues or triggers, we suddenly experience the implicit memories, connected to those triggers long ago. Umm… I remember uh… probably five, six years ago, I had the lovely opportunity to give a workshop for the state of Massachusetts, adolescence in residential care. Umm… I'm a consultant to the state of Massachusetts on trauma informed care and someone in our group had this wonderful idea that teenagers were old enough to understand what I'm, essentially what I'm teaching you. And so 40 teenagers came to this day long workshop and they were all wonderful. Umm…, they ask such, you know, this was very personal to them since most umm…, most adolescence in the residential mental health programs tend to have been traumatized and I had them break into groups and spend some time brainstorming the things that they were aware of as triggers. Fascinating. Again think Massachusetts where there is a lot of, a lot of snow and bad weather in win interest. Umm… a number said, snow, rain are triggers. Because just think about it. Where is a child when it's snowing outside or, or during a big rainstorm? Those are the weather situations in which children are often trapped in the house and if the danger comes from inside the house, umm… then that weather system becomes a trigger. Umm… the snow, cigarette smoke. One very poignant, one, when I'm with my family, it's triggering, when I can't see them, it's triggering. So umm… I just did an service for patients, an intensive workshop at an addictions treatment center, trying to remember, oh, here we go. And we also brainstormed triggers and here is the list they came up with. Again these are all adults in a 90 day addiction recovery program. Umm… being surprised, having to wait for something. Umm…, seeing families together, being along, notice, notice, all of their, of the, of the paradoxes, you know, kind of the umm… being alone and being with people, both are often triggering. Also there are number of triggers connected to authority figures, umm… which includes us of course. Including being asked a lot of questions by authority figures. So of course, I took that one to heart because umm… now I ask is it triggering for you to have me ask a lot of questions? Umm… being told what to do, being told, you can't do something. Uh… another one that I thought was interesting umm… in competent authority figures, authority figures who don't follow through, who are not responsible and then of course, you'll see all the ones that I think are more obvious like anger of course umm… is triggering. But umm… you know, it's interesting being the center of attention is often a trigger and being invisible is often a trigger. So we, we have to be really curious about what triggers which patient because sometimes oh another, another one I think is really important for therapists to know. Being disappointed umm… is a huge trigger and I think that relates to the impact of neglect for or traumatic attachment. Another brainstorming exercise we did with the same group was how can you tell when you're triggered? What tells you that you're not just having a reaction to the immediate environment but you're actually having memories? And notice the number of, of uh… promise of having to do with the body. Shallow breathing, holding the breath, umm… pit tightness, clenching in the stomach, increased heart rate. I was very impressed by the, the level of sophistication umm… in terms of the body. Umm… but even some very important emotional feelings sense of not belonging. Umm… being on the outside looking in. Feeling small and I would say, feeling small, powerless, umm… helpless, fear of abandonment is mentioned. Uh… more behavioral jumping to conclusions, jumping to the worst case scenario. I want people to be aware of what's likely to trigger them before they get triggered because that makes it so much easier to work with. Now implicit memories can take all kinds of forms. From intrusive emotions that we might have called overreactions uh… and I think many clients are, are really happy to have this understanding of triggered emotions because they are in activation of memory often being out of proportion. Obviously, my client's reaction to a man on the elevator with out of proportion to the level of danger but it's very real to her. Umm… negative thoughts, self-punitive thoughts, thoughts that predict doom or a threat, thoughts umm… that express negative believes about the self. Umm… all of those can be implicit memories. So my client says, I'm having this intrusive thought that I don't deserve anything and I'm the lowest of the low. Uh… I deserve everything I got. That is very likely to be an implicit memory of the perpetrator shaming and blaming the child. Umm… impulses when the client jumps up and runs out of your office in the middle of the session. That's memory. Right, it's usually kind of to say, I don't feel safe here, I have to get out of here, I'm trapped and, and then they go. And most of us choose to let them go umm… because we don't want them to feel trapped. Umm… and umm… and so those are memory too. There was an alarm that went off in your bodies and then they have the impulse to run. You know, hiding in the closest. Umm… somatic, many, many somatic sensations. I've had a number of clients who have dizziness as a symptom. Umm… sometimes lasting for days, sometimes weeks, sometimes months. Umm… pain, umm… floating, tingling, all of those. So implicit memories take many, many forms and the question I ask myself when I suspect this might be the case, I say to myself is this, is this symptom or reaction explainable by something right here, right now? Umm… if it's out of context for right here, right now, I say, would this symptom fit back in this client's childhood? And for instance the dizziness of my client Amy, I remember thinking, dizziness, (inaudible )of course. After some of the terrible abuse she suffered, it would be normal to feel dizzy, disoriented, umm… sick, weak, all kinds of things. Yeah, and she also gets triggered when she, when she's unwell, when she's getting over a cold or a flu, umm… which also would fit. So then I might say that's considered the possibility that the dizziness is body memory. Now, the, the autonomic nervous system, you know, it's so interesting isn't it. I never learnt these things in my training. It really was my years at the trauma center at Bessel Van Der Kolk's trauma center as an instructor and supervisor that I was exposed to this kind of information and then when I met (inaudible )and, and began to study sensory motor psychotherapy her work. But you know, when we talk about affect, we talk about affect tolerance, effect is driven by the autonomic nervous system. Whether we have a little feeling, whether we are numb, whether we have overwhelming feelings is dictated by the autonomic nervous system. This is a very, very simple model. It comes from sensory motor psychotherapy. And this is how I explain it to my clients, the same way I explain it to you. I say, you know, we have a body, keep it at high activation. I say, you know, kind of like superman, ripping tall buildings out of a single bound. You know, having the strength to pick the 3,000 pound car of the little child. And we have bodies capable of very, very low activation. Umm… as in a medically induced coma or recovering from surgery. But hopefully in our lives, there won't be many occasions when we need that high, high arousal or that low energy conserving state. Most of the time, hopefully our arousal will fluctuate within what Dan Siegel(ph) calls the window of tolerance. (inaudible )calls it the optimal arousal zone and the thing that's key is optimal arousal for the situation and the, the widths of the window of tolerance determines our effect tolerance. So just think about this, you know, our autonomic arousal is contributing all day long to our energy level, to the intensity of our reactions. So you know, you might wake up in the morning, in a state of low activation and it might take you a little while to get to a high enough level within the window of tolerance that you're ready to see your clients. Uh… you certainly don't want to be in high, high emergency uh… mode when you see your clients. But you certainly don't want to be in very low barely breathing activation either. So all the, but when you go to bed at night, you want your arousal to slowly power down you until you're in a state consistent with falling asleep and many of our clients difficulty sleeping has to do with chronic high activation. Now, how do you get this window of tolerance that has room for intense feeling but also can power down so you can go to sleep at night? Can give you energy for even your most challenging clients? Well, we get of our parents. When we are distressed, when we're in high distress or when we're low or we're feeling tired, bored, sick, lonely, someone picks us up, cheers us up, uh… gets us to smile and laugh or calms us down and soothes us, so that it feels that everything is okay. And as you probably are remarking right now as I am, you know, it takes a wide window of tolerance in the parent to be able to as we say these days, regulate the child's state so that as the child ends up in the window of tolerance. But that's really the cycle. Baby in distress, baby bored and unhappy. We intervene and we return the baby's autonomic nervous system to that optimal state. And then actually what happens to parents is this, this is I think the reward in why there are so many parents who do faster secure attachment because when the baby is back in that optimally aroused state, so are we. And there is a moment of attunement that's very, very precious to parent and child. Now, in the wake of growing up in a threatening world, the window of tolerance, this actually what we should see here, I should redraw this picture, umm… the window of tolerance doesn't develop. Now, baby is not born with a window of tolerance. So there, the window of tolerance remains small. Sometimes I joke, you know, this client has a window of tolerance, the size of a toothpick and some clients with a very tiny window of tolerance have primarily symptoms driven my sympathetic hyper arousal. Those are the clients who are impulsive, who act out, who are can't remember the pickle they got themselves into the last time. So the same poor judgment is exercised again because the frontal cortex shuts down. These are also the clients who tend to be suspicious, defensive, mistrustful, hyper vigilant, the client who say, what did you mean? No, you're judging me. That's very much that group. Umm… also clients who have a lot of flashback nightmares and intrusive symptoms and they importantly are suicidal self-destructive and addictive clients. We also have a group of clients suffering from the effects of hypo arousal. Those are clients often they preserve with a diagnosis of depression who are numb, their effect is flat, sometimes they feel very feel far away, sometimes they feel like innards object just sitting. They tend to come faithfully but they have great difficulty engaging. You know the hypo arousal group has away sing thoughts and sometimes are mistaken for bipolar patients. The hypo arousal group has very slowed thinking. Has trouble formulating the words and also tends to be preoccupied with shame, depression, self-loathing and uh… to be a beast of burden because you have to have energy to say no. hypo arousal leads to a kind of passive yes, okay, I'll do it. And that we have some clients of course who, who oscillate between the two. Umm… what I love about this and this, this changed my life when I first heard (inaudible )speak and then became her student. This really changed how I did therapy because instead of seeing each presenting problem as a whole separate issue that we have to address. I began to see, we can address the flashbacks and intrusions, the uh… suicidal ideation and the terror. We can address that just by bringing the hyper arousal down. Uh… so it's really a wonderful way of seeing things. It really changes the way we work. Umm… now, one of the other challenges is that over time, the symptoms come to be interpreted as who I am. We identify with that. So, our clients who have a lot of fear and expectation of danger start to take that on as identity. I'm too afraid to go out of the house. It's not safe anywhere. Those in hyper arousal start to feel fraudulent or unmotivated and then, you know, the more you say to yourself, I'm an underachiever, the more likely it is that you won't have the energy to get up and do what you had intended to do. Umm… chronic irritability. I'm an angry person or mistrusted fear. I don't like people. And then most, most, most concern is the tendency for clients to identify with their shame and come to believe that they are failure and those who interpret, wanting to die as deserving to die. That's when suicidality gets more concern. You know passive suicidal ideation is just part and parcel of the living legacy of trauma. Umm… where we start to get concerned is when the ideation has energy and it has an intentionality, intentionality to it which doesn't necessarily always means a plan and the plan doesn't always mean intentionality. But it's, I can hear intentionality in people's voices, you know, I deserve to die has an intentionality to it. And in an angry quality than can easily be turned against itself. Now, Bassel Van Der Kolk reminds us that one of the most robust findings of the neuroimaging studies is the following. Under stress, the higher brain areas involved in executive functioning, so again we're talking right here, the pre-frontal cortex planning for the future, anticipating the consequences of one's actions and inhibiting inappropriate responses become less active are ennadilus(ph) truly problematic if, I do a lot of uh…, a lot of in-service trainings for the state of Massachusetts on suicidal and self-harming behavior and I always say no one ever healed him or herself with a working pre-frontal cortex. That's the inactivity, the inhibition of the pre-frontal cortex is the most dangerous uh… phenomenon to our health. This by the way is how (inaudible )Herman came to revive (inaudible )face oriented treatment model. Umm… in the late 80s, she became concerned that her trauma patients, so she had, she had discovered trauma, she's begun to see, there was a constellation of symptoms, common to rape survivors and childhood abuse survivors and then she noticed that although there was relief at first in realizing that real events had contributed to their symptoms, when they started talking about the events, her clients got significantly worse and many of them ended up in hospitals, very suicidal. It seemed that the more they talked what happened to them, the more disregulated, the more overwhelmed they got. So she brought back an old model, the (inaudible )treatment model that had gone out of favor when Freud eclipsed (inaudible ) in the development of what is now modern mental health and dividing trauma treatment into three stages. The first, I hope you'll come away from this web cast feeling as I do that the first phase is actually much more important than you ever realized. Because it isn't just about being stable enough to do the work of trauma memory processing, it's actually about transforming the physical and umm… action oriented symptoms so that our nervous systems can develop a window of tolerance rather than shutting down or moving into potentially dangerous action. So this by the way is a page in my, in my psycho educational flip chart and often I'll bring it out and talk with clients about what phase are we in. Umm… especially if they're rushing to uh… talk about their memories without having stabilized. Umm… I say, let's read this over together and you tell me where we should be working and, and then say, oh, oh, I thought trauma work was talking about what happened. But it looks like, I should be up there uh… establishing a safe environment not living with my abusive boyfriend and I say right, that's very, very spot on as the English say. So when the client can see and can participate in the treatment planning, it is a wonderful thing. And the first order of business in stabilization is reversing that frontal lobe inhibition. As Joseph (inaudible )says, in order for the medulla to respond to field reactions, the pre-frontal region has to be shut down. (inaudible )pathologic fear may require that the patient learn to increase activity in the pre-frontal region, so the medulla is less free to express fear. Symbol, brilliant, right. So if we, who have been trained to get clients to think less and connect more to their feelings have a little learning curve. First, I have to increase activity in the pre-frontal region without umm… teaching my client to disconnect from feelings. So psycho education becomes a way to help clients befriend their symptoms and who also uh… start to transform some of their habitual responses which are out of date. For example, a very common one, avoiding and isolating, uh… which I know is often uh…, you know as a therapist, when someone has deliberately isolated and avoided all of their friends, all their supports and then they say, "I'm so alone. I feel so lonely. No one cares about me." And, and we want to say, "But, but you pushed them all away, you don't answer the phone." And of course, that would be an empathic failure, so we don't. Uh… we try to find and more a supportive way to say it. One of the ways, we can say it is to say, "Huh, so your default setting is when I feel bad, avoid, isolate, don't let anybody in and how did that help you to survive as a kid." Umm… what I find, that's the magic question in my experience. If I say, "HOW did that help you survive as a kid?" Clients will say, "Oh, you know the more I could avoid, the more I could be invisible, the more I could be not there, the better off I was." And then I say, "Yes, brilliant. I just to think you're such a little child when you figured that out. Pretty smart, huh." And, umm… and that's the first kind of what automatic unconscious impulse now. So, now, I have changed the story a little bit from I have to, I have to lock my door, shut off my phone to, oh, this was a pretty cool survival strategy and it would still work if the people calling were abusive. It doesn't work quite as well when they are supportive, umm… but it sure works when they are abusive. The other ingredient besides education is something so simple and I remember a client saying to me, "So, I won't do EMDR, I won't do that stupid body stuff you do" meaning sensory motor. "I won't talk about trauma." Umm… how are you gonna help me? Uh… and I said, "Well, what we're learning is that one of the most potent ways to help you is curiosity." And she looked at me. I actually thought, "Thank goodness, she doesn't have a weapon." "For a lifetime of pain, all you can give me is curiosity." Umm… she was so angry. But you know the interesting thing was she also got more curious, and uh… and we didn't have this conversation about curiosity again. I would just say often "Well, let's get curious about this. That this got to be some adaptive important reason for this." And then she got more and more curious and when people start to get curious, their bodies get calmer. Their nervous systems get calmer. This is also a segue way into use of mindfulness. I'm sure, all of you by now have gotten the word that mindfulness is taking over the mental health world, internationally. And so anything we can do to increase client's interest and ability to be mindful. Dan Siegel says the reason for this is that where attention goes, neural firing goes, and where neurons fire, new connections can be made. And I would say in addition to that, clients can learn to notice the old patterns, the old responses. So what of the ingredients of mindfulness, because some, you know, some client… when I say mindfulness, I find some clients are right on it. They come back the next week, "Oh, I've been listening to Jon Kabat-Zinn's tapes. I signed up for a meditation weekend. Umm… I'm really enjoying the tapes and you know, and they're immediately on board." Other clients, I have to teach element by element. First, I have to teach them to be more aware, to notice, "Oh, so you're having a thought." Then I have to teach the client to notice and, and detach… which then not detach in the disconnect disassociation meaning of the term. But detach, detach in terms of what, uh… in the Buddhist world is called attachment or aversion. So there is a noticing without endorsing, without hating, without loving, umm… without, uh… any conclusion being reached. Then I also have to teach clients to inhibit their tendency to draw conclusions which I do by saying to them, "You know, I'm noticing that you have a tendency to, to draw conclusions, most of them unfavorable to you." And then they laugh and then we both laugh because it's so true. It's not that their conclusions are favorable to themselves. Umm… no harm is done to anyone else. It's the harm to themselves. So I say, "You know, conclusions are not helpful in trauma treatment. Would you be willing to practice being curious not judgmental?" And uh… then I say, "You know, actually if self-judgment will going to help you change it would have done so by now. I think you've done some pretty good research on that. What do you think?" And then we have another good laugh. Because of course, if self-judgment we're gonna change them. They would be, they have a good mental health, gold medal of the year. So we teach the language, I'm having a thought, I'm having a feeling. We teach them to withhold conclusions and just be curious, this has got interesting that I'm having this thought, he's an asshole and this heat is coming up. And uh…, and you know, it's very, very, very interesting because I probably should have done this yesterday. I was gonna meeting with someone who apologized for almost everything she said, "Uh… oh, that isn't nice, oh I shouldn't have said, I hope you're not offended" and uh… and I actually with her I could have done this, I could have said, "I'm noticing that you have a tendency to jump to conclusions. Would you be willing to just notice the thoughts, the feelings the, you know, your gut reactions and just describe them?" It really, I think what happens is the clients actually find that it's easier. Now, I also have to create a, a umm… an environment that pulls from mindfulness and the easiest way to do that is to slow your pace of speaking and thinking. So the client might say, "Oh, I feel so sick. Every time, I think of how I put my foot in my mouth." and I say, "Aha, oh." So one foot in one mouth in one moment and dozens of thoughts coming up. And when you have those thoughts, do you feel better or do you feel worse? Which might seem like a silly question because who is gonna feel better? But it's a mindfulness question, it's just designed to get clients to notice. I have a thought, that thought makes me feel good. I have another thought. That thought makes me feel bad, and then curiosity. In mindfulness, we distinguish clearly between a thought, a feeling, a body sensation and an impulse or an action and you know, in, in traditional psychotherapy we tend to kind of mush those categories. If a client says, I feel worthless, umm… we don't necessarily say to ourselves or to the client, "Oh, this client has a belief she is worthless." Because the worthless is not an emotion, it's a conclusion. So, I, I, I know, I'm like the cognition police. Every time my clients say, use the word feel and then I utter a belief, I say, "Oh, you're having that thought again that you're a loser. That's so interesting. Can we be curious about that thought?" Umm… you know what triggers that or I could say "Umm… notice the thought and the feelings that, that come up and, and ask yourself, umm… when did I first hear those words and have those feelings?" And of course, usually where clients have heard them is in childhood. In trauma treatment, we want to focus on post traumatic triggering, because that's what makes PTSD syndrome worse. Uh… it makes shame worse, it makes depression worse, it makes anxiety worse. Umm… and we want to help clients to notice that when they are triggered implicit emotional memories come up. And over and over and over again, this is just an example I might do this, umm… three, four, five times in one session, umm… over and over until the clients get the hang of it. This particular client was a client in a state hospital that I was consulting to and I've come the day after she cut herself and I said Charlie(ph), because I don't want to trigger someone who has just cut by looking severe and disapproving, because that is definitely a trigger for trauma survivors. And I say, "Wow, I hear you cut last night. What might have triggered you? Let's be curious about this." And she says, what most client say, so we can't let this discourage us. She says, "I don't know, I just hate myself." And I say, "Oh, well, what was going on just before you cut?" And she says, "Well, my boyfriend was supposed to call me but he didn't. But I don't care." "Interesting. What thoughts and feelings came up when he didn't call?" Uh… and she says, "I was mad at myself for trusting him. That's why I hate myself." It's very important here. I then communicate that I get that. She's not mad at herself for cutting. She's mad at herself for trusting. That's trauma logic. What do I do to my body it doesn't matter but being vulnerable, are you kidding? No wonder, I hate myself and I say "And you probably couldn't tell anyone, because you felt ashamed of trusting him, huh?" And she says, "Yeah, I thought, what kind of fool am I for trusting him, what an idiot?" And we go on. I say, "Wow, when you had that thought, I'm an idiot, what feelings came up?" And she says, "I wanted to kill him and I wanted to kill me." That is the fight response. All right, those two go hand in hand. Then I say, "Wow, how overwhelmed were you?" Now, this word overwhelm, remember it, because the word overwhelm is a signal to the trauma survivor that you get it. You get that when you're in hyper arousal which is certainly, which have to be to hurt yourself. When you're in hyper arousal, feelings are overwhelming and uh… it's quite amazing, it's like a little key that unlocks the door, the trust door, if we use that word overwhelm and she says, "Completely overwhelmed. I couldn't stand it." And I said, "Well, then no wonder you cut. Because cutting triggers adrenaline. So you feel calmer. You are just trying to get control back on." And she says, "Yeah, but now I'm feeling stupid and my arm is killing me." This is such a wonderful thing, you know, I, I evoke such fear in clinics and psychiatric hospitals where I come into consult and I recommend to the therapist that they positively reframe, uh… self-harm and suicidal behavior. They say, "No, no, we can't, we enforce it." and I say, "I promise you, you won't reinforce it." Because what will happen when you positively reframe it. The client is going to be free to say, "Yeah. But now I'm feeling stupid and my arm is killing me." Umm… because that's what happens, when it see other way around when we say, "Oh, cutting is not safe, it's not, it's going to slow your progress." The client says, "Yeah. But how am I supposed to get relief?" And so if I say, "Well, of course cutting brings relief, the client's free to own that other pole." And then she says something that made me chuckle. Umm… I said, "Do you want me to show you something else that will help you feel less overwhelmed? It won't work as well as cutting but it doesn't get even trouble." Uh… that's a very important disclaimer, because we don't want to pretend to clients that our healthy, umm… interventions will work as well as unhealthy interventions, because if healthy interventions work as well, the client would have discovered those. And she says, "Sure, I would like to survive this weekend." And the sure was made me chuckle because she was a client who thought against all the coping skills group, wouldn't go to DBT, didn't want any skills, why were they trying to make her learn these stupid skills? And, and in this context, when I use the mindful, uh… umm… analysis and the reframing to help the client get to "But now I'm feeling stupid and my arm is killing me." At that point, the client wants to skills. The state is often made in programs understandably because they are working with groups of people who are not all on the same timing. Umm… is that were often skills before the client has actually felt a sense of the need for them. Now, the other things, we want to do, we want to help client dis-identify from the symptoms. We want them to understand the symptoms as symptoms, right, you are not your symptoms. And every symptom we have to assume has a positive intent and we need to heighten curiosity about what that symptom is trying to accomplish. We have to ask the question, " how might that have helped you survive?" And here are some of the things that the symptoms try to accomplish. Umm… suicidal symptoms are a way of taking control over overwhelming feelings and over what feels like, umm… impossible situations. I find when they are reframed as a bailout plan or a parachute, they become much easier to work with. And umm… cutting, self-injury, umm… is works because we produce adrenaline and endorphins and those are two very, very, umm… effective neuro-chemicals. I wish, there was a way to, umm… to use them without hurting the body. Umm… but for the moment, I'm going to reframe them. Let the client say, yeah, but it's a problem because that's more likely to lead to safety. Eating disorders and addictive behavior, umm… when you restrict, you can't feel. Isn't that amazing? So by the way all of the eating disorders are associated with numbing and uh… and a, and a, a reduction, excuse me, in the feeling of sensation and emotion. Just, it's just fascinating. The key is that we want our trauma survivors to stay here instead of going there. Uh… in his new book "The Body Keeps the Score" Bassel van der Kolk speaks eloquently about the challenge of being here now as a much, much greater, umm… priority in trauma treatment than processing memory or having a narrative of the past. So here is a total example of helping clients stay here instead of going there. The client comes in, uh… complaining about feeling overwhelmed, "No, I can't handle this anymore, I give up, I just don't have it in me" and, and then look what do we do next? We amp up the curiosity, "Oh. This is so interesting." I wonder if you're triggered, it must have been a trigger. If you are so overwhelmed and then we validate or reframe the, the meaning of the symptoms. "Let's be curious. How could wanting to give up have helped you survive in an unsafe world? How smart was that? You know, that's pretty good." And, and then help the client to stay here. Not to suppress the feeling but to reframe the feeling as an implicit memory. I generally find my clients like the term body memory. Sometimes feeling memory. So I say, just keep saying over and over, "This is just triggering, it's just feeling memory. I'm remembering how it felt then." Because that means that you're aware that, that there is a now. Uh…, it's really, a really interesting way of being here now. So let me… I'm from kind of jump ahead because I see they were getting close to the end of our time. Umm… I want to say something about, about how we intervene directly with the body to change the experience of traumatic encoding. And the key is that telling the story again, read the body, keeps the score, uh… Bassel that talks about how telling the story is exposure treatment, processing memories, we desensitize those memories. But the most important thing in post traumatic stress is having a present. The here and now experience of the traumatic past as paradigm writes must become the focal point of exploration and change. Let me say a few words sensory motor psychotherapy. When I took the training, it was only because I was so inspired by Pat (inaudible )work. I heard her speak at a conference, saw her videotapes and I had just finished saying, I'm never ever, ever going to do a long training again. This is it. I have enough of a repertoire to treat people and then I saw her tapes, I was an EMDR therapist. I've been working in the trauma field from when I went to Judith Herman's clinic in 1990, we, we were kind of inventing trauma treatment as we went along and I thought that's enough. Between EMDR and what I've been doing, I'll be fine. And then I saw her speak and I knew I had to take this training. And the reason why is because sensory motor psychotherapy is a traditional talking therapy. Umm… that integrates body centered interventions that don't require the use of touch. So in my mind a body psychotherapy meant you had to touch the client. I wasn't so keen on this. But I began to see how the body could be incorporated in a talking therapy. In sensory motor psychotherapy we're less interested in the narrative. We use the narrative only to activate the implicit memories and we look for patterns. We look for patterns that are indicative of adaptations to trauma that are no longer useful for the client and we're interested in right here, right now, how is the past encoded in this client's body emotional responses, patterns of thinking, even patterns of perceiving. And our work is centered around that window of tolerance diagram because regulation of arousal is a prerequisite for any successful trauma treatment. If trauma is the experience of hyper arousal or hypo arousal, being in either state tells the body, it's still unsafe. If we can help our clients regulate arousal so that they are in the window of tolerance. It is funny, I had a client who wrote a poem. Uh… and which she use this wonderful line, she said, "I'm clinging to the bars of the windows of tolerance," and uh… and, "and as long as I cling to those bars, I'll be okay." That's the, that's the self-sense of clients who learn how to bring their arousal, their emotions, their reactions into the window of tolerance. And we work with patterns, what we call procedural learning and memory. That repeat over and over again. And umm… either by bringing the client's attention to them, through mindfulness or disrupting them making it difficult without empathically saying to the client, this is the skill. Disrupting for instance, disrupting a client's pattern of going on and on. "Well, I'm such a loser and I'm so stupid. No wonder, I don't have any friends. You know, I don't even know why you're seeing me." We interrupt those patterns because we know that their survival patterns that are of no use now. And the key is, without triggering and disregulating the client. It's very, very funny. Umm… we assume that even self-destructive behavior is an attempt at a solution. It isn't… just it might be a problem. We might have to address it as a problem. But its intention is to be a solution. We bring mindfulness skills into the therapy, notice, let's notice that reaction. Let's notice the sequence, let's notice what trigger, umm… umm… got you to that place. Umm… we very gently and what we call non-violently introduce clients to the body umm… often by using our own bodies I might say, "Well, you know ,when I feel anxious, umm… my heart starts beating very fast and I have all these butterflies in my stomach. How does your body tell you that you're anxious?" All right, so nothing is scary. I don't have to use the word body, and I don't have to use the word for any parts of the body that are problematic for the client. So I'm noticing that we are at the end of our time. I know you're going to, you're going to have these slides. So you'll be able to read the last, uh… the last few of these that we haven't got into. Uh… and I'm even giving you some sensory motor interventions to try. And umm… as well as some strategies for raising and lowering arousal. Uh… and isn't this fun. If you have a hypo arousal client, one of the best ways to increase that client's arousal is to be playful and to use humor and uh… and that's actually very, I think, very regulating for the therapist. And I just want to end with two other little pieces. Umm… one of the, the gifts of sensory motor psychotherapy is the invitation to change our own physical and emotional reactions to the client, what we call semantic counter transfers and one of those ways is by expecting the best and when I found this quote by Goethe(ph), I thought this describes what I do perfectly. If I accept you as you are, I will make you worse. If I treat you as though you are, what you're capable of becoming, I will help you become that. And then we also believe that there is no, there are no trumpets and there are no, you know, that redemption is, is something that is the result of transformation not perceiving it and that actually we change by practice. So I'm going to end with this quotation from Martha Graham that I love. I believe that we learn by practice whether it means to learn to dance by practicing dancing or to learn to live by practicing living. The principles are the same. Practice means to perform over and over again in the face of all obstacles. Some act of vision, of faith, of desire. Practice is a means of inviting what is desired. Thank you all. A pleasure to have you today and uh… take good care. Enjoy, uh… some of the other webinars in the, the series and I hope to…
