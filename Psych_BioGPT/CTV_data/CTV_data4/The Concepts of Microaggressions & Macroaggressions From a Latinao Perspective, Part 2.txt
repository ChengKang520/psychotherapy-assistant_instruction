00:00:00
The Concepts of Microaggresions & Macroagressions from a Latina/o Perspective 

00:00:00
A Conversation with Maritza Gallardo-Cooper Patricia Arredondo David Acevedo Lisa Costa & Carlos Zalaquett 

00:00:00
Current Open and Unintentional Discriminatory Speech as a Macroaggression 

00:00:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT We are in a much more trying time, and the openness and blatantness of the comments have reached a level that I didn't expect in a civil society. You know, it becomes not only offensive, but also as you said, has a major impact on all of us and I wonder about those who are less privileged than us. 

00:00:40
DAVID ACEVEDO I was going to say that makes us, it goes back to the unintentional. It may be a macro-discrimination, but it's unintentional because people will go "I'm just talking about immigration. I have a right to talk about immigration." You go, "Well, yes, you do and who knows where I fall with regard to your policy for immigration, but right now you're not talking about immigration. Right now, you're talking about specific groups of people and making broad, horrific generalizations so we haven't gotten to talk about immigration." 

00:01:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO And now it comes back... 

00:01:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Leading me to...I'm sorry. 

00:01:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Go ahead. 

00:01:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Leading me to a concern, because I've participated in the protests on May, I also connect with the groups that are fighting to change immigration laws. We just went through a family situation, where one of our nephews was almost thrown out of the country. It took four years to get him to be allowed to stay. Now you use really swift bullets in those situations but my concern is this one, we have somehow duplicated the efforts in other words. I've seen much more organization and much more response from Latino groups than ever before and yet, it seems to me that the barriers, the challenges and the labels or the stereotypes have become larger, which is, for me, paradoxical. How do you see it? 

00:02:00
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER I had a personal experience that goes with what all of us are saying on how this is impacting our personal lives. 

00:02:05
Personal Examples of Current Discrimination 

00:02:05
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER I have my mother very ill in the emergency room, she's an elderly woman of 83 years old. The nurse chose the person that came 40 minutes after her, to take the first room in the emergency room, even though she could hardly walk and the other person was a 30-year-old man who was just making jokes and laughing with a female companion. My mom had to walk all the way to the very end and get the last room that only had curtains as a divider, which I explored to see if there was a difference because of symptoms and there was obviously. They told me no, everybody can go to any room, which really kind of confirmed my feelings at the time, which I was not very happy. But the issue was that I shared this with a friend and my friend, this is my friend's, this is my friend. He said, "Maritza, you need to understand. Hospitals are losing so much money because of other people are going there that they don't have insurance. And your mom has an accent, you know." And I was like, wow. This is my friend, after sharing with her what my feeling was. So you see how this is getting justified in some ways, you know, and it's really spreading, spreading in the people. 

00:03:15
Profiling 

00:03:15
DAVID ACEVEDO I was, some time ago, driving and in my car I had a one of those license plate holders that was representative of a particular ethnic group, and I got pulled over. I was surprised to get pulled over, but you know, it's possible that I was speeding. I've sped before in my life. So I pulled over and you know, turned off. "Officer, can I help you?" and the officer says, he can't see me because I have a short car, he says, "Can I see your green card?" [laughs] So I said, "No, you can't." He was, I think, surprised first of all that I spoke it good. "Oh, ah, well, can I see your passport?" I said, "No, I don't normally drive with my passport, do you?" which could have gotten me in a lot of trouble as soon as I said that. Anyway, the story goes on and on and they eventually let me go and what have you. 

00:04:05
Impact of Microaggressions in Yourself 

00:04:05
DAVID ACEVEDO But, after several experiences of that kind of discomfort, what wind up coming off my car was the license plate holder that was representative of my ethnic origin, because I didn't want to deal with that anymore. And so that again, what I've done now and it's unfortunate but it sort of reduced the profile. 

00:04:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO I mean it's profiling and I think that given the example, you've raised the point of privilege before and how I see myself as a person with privilege. You know, I have education. I can really do a lot of self-determination. I can't do everything, obviously. But I think it really does come down to some privilege to reduce some of the psychological distress when you get pulled over all the time. 

00:04:50
Psychological Distress 

00:04:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO But the topic you introduced, or the area you took us into, Carlos, is looking at the psychological distress that people have to live with on a day-to-day basis. It's, sort of, the fear I may be here, I was born here, I am here legally and yet, I'm at risk because I fit a certain profile. And I think of a lot of other people who have to live in fear of that, just going to work, based on the car they drive. Phenotype can't change. 

00:05:30
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER Accent cannot change. 

00:05:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Accent cannot change. So you have all of this operating and again, because we're psychologists and counselors, you think about the psychological toll of living on a day-to-day basis. 

00:05:50
Psychological Toll of: Fear Uncertainty Family Separation Profiling 

00:05:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO You know, is somebody going to pick me up? We've heard enough stories now, these raids that separate parents and children. The mother who was breastfeeding her newborn and they took the baby away and they took the mother away. I mean, it's just hideous and it's psychologically debilitating. It's pretty ridiculous. 

00:06:10
De-humanizing 

00:06:15
LISA COSTAS And if they are not, if we don't know who it is, they're not individuals and they're lumped together, then that's they really dismiss it. 

00:06:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO You know, that's what you said, it sort of dehumanizes... 

00:06:25
LISA COSTAS Dehumanizes, yeah. 

00:06:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO ...the person. They're just another illegal alien. 

00:06:30
LISA COSTAS And then the... 

00:06:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And then you have heightened awareness about differences and if they could just kill some of that, then we have this sort of set back of people having a sort of feeling entitled to say the downer things. For the decision, and I want to thank you all for that, which is to bring the concept of microagression to a level of liveliness that you rarely see, because usually we read about it but we don't talk about this in terms of our personal level in communication, academic level and training and in a professional level and much less in a macro-level. 

00:07:05
How to help those affected by micro and macroggressions 

00:07:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Our discussion referring to people who are affected by all this new societal change we're experiencing nowadays, especially people who live in fear, people who are "separated" from their families, we're talking about immigrants, migrants, those who are affected by this situation and I was wondering how can we contribute to help them to cope with this situation in a more positive, healthy, helpful way, despite the number of barriers and limitations. 

00:07:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Huge question. 

00:07:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Huge question, very true. 

00:07:50
LISA COSTAS I think one of the things we can do, is offer a safe haven. As therapists... 

00:07:50
Counseling and Psychotherapy as a "Safe Heaven" 

00:07:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT You say offer what? 

00:07:55
LISA COSTAS We offer a safe haven, as therapists. Because even though these are real threats for a lot of our clients, we offer the opportunity to talk about the threat, talk about the fear in a safe environment. 

00:08:10
Reach-out: Need to develop skills to work in and with the community. 

00:08:10
LISA COSTAS We have to be able to reach our clients, reach this population. Because out of fear, they're not coming in to our offices perhaps. They're not calling us so we need to also develop skills in bridging and going to the community, rather than wait for these clients to come to us. 

00:08:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I see. 

00:08:30
Educational Forums at Churches, Social Services and Other Community Agencies 

00:08:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah, I think about it from a point of view of educational forums. When you say that, Lisa, about going to the community, often times the social services, the churches, are places where many of the immigrants will seek some relief or some sense of support and there often is an opportunity to talk about your legal rights, about your children in schools and use this as a way of providing a little more accurate information for the families who are living in fear and maybe some of them are keeping their children home when they're actually here legally, because their children were here, born here, they were, you know, they have their papers and all that, but still this rampant fear generalizes to everyone. so they may have this information and what they need is correct information. 

00:09:30
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER But that's one end of the spectrum. I was also thinking of our job really is going to be a lot outside our offices, as I think we need to be. 

00:09:35
Take an Active Rol in Educating the Public 

00:09:40
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER I'm thinking a much more active role, because we need to educate the public. A lot of people are well-meaning, they're not really aware or have the sensitivity, the insight, to realize on how they impact on other people and systems, as well. I think that, you know, in my experience, I have done a lot of training that I have offered myself to do, so that we can do things that will be much more sensitive to the client in question. Specifically, systems-wise. For example, how to conduct an IEP meeting, for example in the school system, where there's more sensitivity to a Latino parent that doesn't speak their language, rather than doing it in a 10 minute meeting and, you know, being sensitive to the needs of the parent. 

00:10:20
Social Justice 

00:10:20
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER So I do believe that there has to be that other realm of working social justice, volunteering, becoming really more active in the community. 

00:10:30
Advocacy 

00:10:30
DAVID ACEVEDO One thing that I have done, sort of based on this notion that it's generalizing and depersonalizing the immigrant that allows for all of these things to happen, is engage in a lot of educational, community education efforts, that give a face to the immigrant story. So that when people are talking about immigrants or Latinos, they're not, they can't sort of hide behind a group. They have to think of two or three people that I introduce them to that are either co-presented with me or if the audience was more sensitive, then I have sort of a voice recording of their story and things of that nature. To sort of make it personal so, and again not to curtail anybody's ability to have a dialog but have the dialog in the apt presence of real data and real people and real stories, not just sort of generalizations. 

00:11:25
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER Well, I'm talking about concepts rather than having... 

00:11:25
DAVID ACEVEDO Right. Right. Right. [laughs] 

00:11:25
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER ...it in that... 

00:11:25
Multicultural Competencies 

00:11:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT But also choosing, knowing what we know and we are based in psychologies and of course counselors, knowing what we know about the multicultural competencies and how much more knowledgeable we kind of are, should we find an intersection between microaggressions and the multicultural competencies? 

00:11:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Absolutely. You know, when I reflect back on the competencies, they really were developed for practitioners. There's a strong emphasis on our role as practitioners. Knowing ourselves, understanding the world view at the other end, and using all of that for interventions and strategies. It's very cognitive if you really step back and look in on the competencies, they're very cognitive and it's textbook-y. I think the missing aspect of it is the emotionality that all of us bring to a relationship and I think the microaggression concept can be a very relevant bridge to begin to explore awareness of my emotions and how I may in fact when confronted say with a person who speaks with an accent, how I might react to that person before it becomes a microaggression. And where I might be working with students who are, let's say, first generation of college students in a counseling center and I might assume, and maybe even act on it, that they're not here legally and ask them, you know, to clarify who they are. So I mean there is ways that we can build all of that emotionality in some language into competencies and use these concepts to help explain that. 

00:13:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Can we think of practical ways of doing that? 

00:13:35
Counseling both, Receivers and Senders 

00:13:35
DAVID ACEVEDO Sure, I mean I think, you know, one of the ways we talked about earlier was such raises in our role as practitioners, as counselors, both working with the people who are victims, or on the receiving end. I don't want to call them victims, but on the receiving end of microaggressions and the people that perpetuate the microaggressions, as a role, counseling there. 

00:14:00
Speaking about it, Normalizing, Empowering 

00:14:00
DAVID ACEVEDO You know, there's a sort of a normalizing function of language that allows you to talk about the microaggression. There's a, as Patricia pointed out earlier, the teaching of skills that empower the person to be able to respond to a microaggression. And I think that's sort of, a really for me, personally, has been a milestone in my development when it comes to microaggressions is having enough skills that deciding whether to react or not react to a microaggression is an empowered choice that I make. Versus just... 

00:14:35
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER You make a decision. 

00:14:35
DAVID ACEVEDO Yeah, right. Right. So I think specific to the counseling relationship, those are some of the ways that we could do it. 

00:14:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO A thought that I had, if you don't mind, otherwise I'll lose it... 

00:14:45
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER Please, don't lose it. That's okay. 

00:14:45
Perspective-Taking 

00:14:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO ...is, you said, how can we help people, it's a whole thing on perspective-taking. So, you know, I can talk about my experience and so I'm not an immigrant. I'm not a Latina, Latino who's at the receiving end of it, so I'm a student in class and I say I don't quite get it. So, you know, you do this role-playing to try to introduce what we call is perspective-taking. So today, you're an immigrant. Today you have to go to the store and buy this and so forth and so on. And so you try to have that person experience what it's like to be marginalized and so forth. I mean, it's kind of one of those basic putting yourself in someone else's shoes, but I think we have to go in that direction. If someone says, "Well, I've never experienced a microaggression," so then you have to have them take on this another role and do this kind of perspective-taking to perhaps become a little bit more thought out about what this is, what goes on for people in daily life. 

00:15:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And I can see how this would help in the personal, interpersonal level and also, at the macro-level because we are talking, you were talking about how to influence systems and all that. 

00:16:05
Teaching about micro and macroaggressions in education, internship, and clinical training 

00:16:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So what about after the provisionary, you were mentioning some ideas in terms of how to integrate this, so the student would have a feeling about what it looks like and what it feels like to be in that position. What other studies you can use in both levels, at practitioner and at level. 

00:16:25
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER As a practitioner, I think we need to face this issue in therapy. We need to ask, because I think that many times we do not ask. We just assume, or we just go with the narratives that the client has, without really exploring other issues that could be very, very relevant. And the microaggression is something that often is not addressed. Having a training in multicultural competencies will allow you to go beyond that point and go into deeper issues in the therapy process. So I include that as part of my regular routine of when I am trying to learn who my client is. 

00:17:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Interesting. And how do you prepare, for example, counselors in training, who are psychologists in training, to do something like that? 

00:17:05
Provide students with opportunities for contacs 

00:17:10
LISA COSTAS Well, one of the things that I think, that I found helpful, is to, not only the student that has received microaggression, but also the ones that inadvertently or on purpose engaged in microaggressive behavior, to provide opportunities for contact. Because I think you learn from experience and to provide the contact opportunities to embed themselves in the population. And even if it's a Latino student, there's such variety and richness in all our Latino cultures, that providing that opportunity to meet, you know, to have that personal contact, have that personal experience of knowing what it's like to be part of certain cultures. What it's like to live in this part of town, what it's like to receive services from an agency. Providing those opportunities in projects, interviews, so it's a more experiential opportunity. 

00:18:10
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER Kind of, to be in the roots. 

00:18:10
LISA COSTAS That allows that, yeah, to live through the process of personal awareness and change. 

00:18:15
Provide instances for processing the experience: E.g., Writing, Journaling, In-Class Conversations, Groups Discussions, Course Assignments 

00:18:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And I'm assuming that there would be following processing... 

00:18:20
LISA COSTAS The processing, yeah, either writing in process, discussion, discussion in class that invite that, and I've seen it work very well where it sometimes, the person that engages in the microaggression has that "Aha!" moment of like, "Wow. I didn't know how my behavior was impacting others". And then for the person who receives the microaggression, there even being a set of skills and choices. You know, I can see this in another context, I can choose to answer this way or choose to walk away, or choose to deal with this in a different way. 

00:19:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah. 

00:19:00
Addressing Discomfort 

00:19:00
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER I don't know if you've experienced this, I remember Rollo May used to say that our societies the way they are because we have so much guilt about slavery and all the issues that have happened and I think that there is some truth to that. Because in my experience, even with old colleagues, or interns that I supervise, when I bring the issues of multicultural issues, racial issues, ethnic issues, there's a lot of discomfort. It really, it's a lot of work to get through that to be able to deal with more issues. 

00:19:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT In class, for example, how do you go through the process of discomfort and help your student reach a different level of understanding? 

00:19:35
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER I think that one of the issues that Patricia has brought in, the whole issue of basic skills in training of role-playing, of circumstances where you have a client and you bring and you do some role-playing and you take that perspective, is one way. But I think it's always bringing in when you do it a discussion of a case. Always bring that piece into it and many times in clinical training, in my experience, have been many people that I have supervised. For example, they don't bring that is a person, he speaks one language or whatever. They don't explore beyond that and I think that that's an issue that is missing. 

00:20:10
Taking a Multicultural Course is not Enough: Continue Learning! 

00:20:15
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER Sometimes people take a class in multicultural and they really learn there, but it's not generalized to the other ones. That's why I think it's a fault. I think it has to be integrated. 

00:20:20
Contextualize 

00:20:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO I think that your point too is that when we provide these examples, we have to contextualize them. 

00:20:30
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER Exactly. 

00:20:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO And that's where the experience in neighborhood X, neighborhood Y, school X, school Y, I mean, that's context. People live in those real contexts and I think, you know it's, we can't just role-play in a sort of vacuum. 

00:20:45
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER Exactly. 

00:20:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO It's just, that's how I was trained but you know, obviously that fell short when I started doing my practicum and internships that had to work with real people. 

00:20:55
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER And Latino people because I didn't have the training to do that, you know? That's sort of the whole thing. 

00:21:00
Development of Competencies is Indeed Developmental and Affects All Areas of Our Work: E.g., Assessment, Evaluation, Research, Counseling, Psychotherapy, Advocacy, Social Justice, etc. 

00:21:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO That too. So I think that the competency development, and it is development, you know, has many, many junctures that go beyond multicultural counseling to Maritza's point. You know we need to talk about perspective-taking when it comes to assessment, conducting research... 

00:21:25
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER With consultation. 

00:21:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO ...and then of course, the practicum itself. There has to be this embededness because microaggressions happen in all of these settings, in all of these educational experiences when we're training our students. 

00:21:40
Social Justice Training 

00:21:40
DAVID ACEVEDO There's a lot of social justice frameworks for teaching counseling or for doing counseling. That's an important framework where we're sort of, that lends itself to the discussion of those issues. 

00:21:50
Person-Centered Training 

00:21:50
DAVID ACEVEDO In the counseling, I know Carolyn Tucker just said, another framework come up that talked about person-centered counseling. You know, if you really are taking perspective of the client, then you'll start understanding microaggressions or how, you know what I mean? So, I think, that's a sort of a direction for us to go on this. 

00:22:10
Use current teaching that includes these concepts, modify what is necessary, and add new frameworks. 

00:22:10
DAVID ACEVEDO To look at the frameworks that we use to teach and do counseling and those can't account, either modifying them like Patricia suggested, to account for microaggressions, but using those that already existed or sort of more implicitly inclusive of those ideas. 

00:22:25
Combine Cognitive and Affective Dimensions to Facilitate Meaningful and Long-Lasting Learning 

00:22:30
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER And the other thing, the additive, you know, well, with me moving into from a cognitive perspective we can make it an affective experience. If you don't make that connection I think that the person just leaves with the information but will never be able to apply it. And even though some people have experience when I've done training, or taught a course, they have found, well I have never experienced that. But if you really start working with a person and a student, they've had experiences that are similar to a microaggression. And you start making those feelings that way and that's the way that I can bring more of the affect, you know, the personal experience alive to make this a meaningful construct. You know, personal and professional. 

00:23:10
Inclusion 

00:23:10
LISA COSTAS And the thing that's very key is that concept of inclusion and you spoke about that yesterday that we're all cultural beings, in one way or another. And a lot of times our students come into our courses and our clients come in, not thinking that way and perhaps we then try to protect ourselves from what they think they're going to find, but it's such a wonderful experience that they find that there's more to them. There is much more to them when they are included and they feel included. So a lot of the times the approach of inclusion as cultural beings from the get-go, even if it's a training course and then looking at these things from that point of view, defenses are lowered and people are more open. 

00:23:55
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER Exactly. 

00:23:55
Education and Training of Our Peers, Other Colleagues, and Educators 

00:23:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO I think the other area too, obviously, where this discourse has to happen, Carlos said you get from education and training and field work is with our peers, you know, our colleagues who are also the other educators, the other clinical supervisors, where I think this would be a very meaningful discussion, as I'm sitting here reflecting on this with my peers in the counselor training program, in Milwaukee. Why don't we entertain this conversation, you know, microagressions has been written about now. How about if we talk about this and what does it mean to us as educators and how might we become more conscious of it as we teach and as we try intervening any given situation. It doesn't have to be Latino or Asian, but you know, there are statements that can be made in a class setting that are pretty insensitive and offend someone. How do we as educators take on the responsibility to process that, to hold someone accountable, hold ourselves accountable? 

00:25:10
Curriculum, Syllabi, and Educational Institutions 

00:25:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT How does this need to go into the curriculum, into the individual syllabi? Maybe you should mention having one multicultural class, for example, how do you make that experience meaningful. It's meaningful at the time, but it tends to fade off when you keep doing the old stuff in every other place. So through the curriculum and then of course from a top down position. I think that in our case we have written about how colleges of education can embrace a process of change and how through their approach, they can help faculty to do the discussion and collaboration to infuse this into the curriculum. I think we have outlined some very successful studies on how to not only address microaggressions, but also how to educate about microaggressions. How to move it from the cognitive to the emotional, to make this not just the book knowledge as you say, but also an experiential knowledge. What else, now that we are wrapping up? 

00:26:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Go ahead. 

00:26:20
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER I have a concern about training. I've tried doing training with colleagues, for example, and unfortunately time always becomes an issue and if you don't do follow-up, it just fades away. Because sometimes you have a three-hour training. What can you do in a three-hour training? Something that isn't in-depth. You know, and you have to request systems to give you a little more time to do a more follow-up. Sometimes we don't have the opportunity to really go in the depth that we want to. It just becomes too superficial and if it's superficial, it melts or fades away. That's a concern I've always had. 

00:26:45
Cultural Values of Latinas/os: Bringing the Conversation Back to What and Who We are 

00:26:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO That idea there, to bring back to the point of view that we're talking about, is from a Latino perspective, Latina/Latino perspective. I would say that appreciating that our cultural values as Latinos of personalismo, familismo, dignidad, respeto, all of those which are really fundamental interpersonal values are ones that, you know, if that's how we've been brought up then those in fact are more important and brought to bear in interpersonal interactions. So that well somebody may say to you you're just being too sensitive. Well you know this hits at the core of my cultural values. I'm being disrespected and so I think that if we look at it from a cultural point of view, that those values have to be recognized so that the microaggression conversation is not just again a very generic one, but brings it back to who we are as Latinos and how we have been socialized to respect the other and to respect hierarchy and to really not give direct feedback. So we might, nos comemos, we might swallow something rather than speak up about it. We talked earlier about how many of us have been socialized not to give direct feedback and to sort of, it seems like we're avoiding it and therefore we don't deal directly with a microaggression. But a lot of that is the cultural learning and so I think we have to take that into account as we talk about that and there's a continuum. I tend to be a little more direct. 

00:28:50
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER And also the issues of us in relation and you know our culturation and those issues have some impact in that someone who'll not have maybe the assertiveness to confront, as compared to someone who will just be, who use an indirecta you know, and will go in the backdoor to address the issue. We need to be sensitive to the people, our colleagues and our clients, to be able to address those interventions at the correct level, I guess. 

00:29:15
DAVID ACEVEDO We don't want to be microaggressive in assuming what the correct response to one of those is. There's sort of, it may happen among us having discussions about what an appropriate reaction to certain microaggressions would have been that were very different solutions that really each one of them seemed like it could have worked or would have satisfied at least the person who was on the receiving end. 

00:29:35
Importance and Role of Non-Verbal Communication 

00:29:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO I think the other part that, in looking at it from a culture point of view as Latinas and Latinos, is the whole non-verbal area and how the role of non-verbal communication picks up, fits into this. We talked last night about being very field dependent, where we pick up the nuances whether it's a gesture, a facial gesture, whether somebody walks away from you when they're talking with you and how you can personalize that and take this as an insult. So I think the non-verbals and again what Hall talks about, you know, societies that are high-context and low-context and how that fits into this discussion as well. So there are a number of, I guess you could say, academic concepts that we could roll into this discussion as we teach about microaggression, so that again it's not just about the interpersonal and behavior, verbal or non-verbal, but there's I think a larger anthropological literature, that gives a little bit more depth to this as well. 

00:30:55
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER Well, I think that, going with what you say Patricia, is that not only do we need to check also what is our clients or our colleagues, or our peers, or whoever we're working in this area with, what is their attribution. Because for a lot of Latinos, when I have addressed the issue of microaggression, their attribution is me falto al respeto and that's and, you know, I always have felt that a switch of power or powerful concept for us that you don't use because it has so many different meanings and you need to just not take it as a faltar el respeto, you have to dig into it and really explore what kind of faltar el respeto that really is all about, but that brings another issue within our own culture on how we will verbalize some of that or express it. 

00:31:35
"Finger-Pointing" Feelings and Double-Problems 

00:31:40
LISA COSTAS Because then it offers again, moving back, we're bringing that context, looking at all the aspects of what a microaggression could be, but also the other part is when we look at our students, our majority students, that if we stay with what is a microaggression and stay very theoretical about it, it becomes almost finger-pointing and defensive. 

00:32:05
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER That's when you feel people get rigid and very defensive. 

00:32:10
LISA COSTAS Very defensive. So we want to open that by looking at context, by looking at the attributions. 

00:32:15
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER Exactly. 

00:32:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Attribution is great stuff. 

00:32:15
LISA COSTAS You know, what's that all about? The intentions. 

00:32:20
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER The intentions. In the example I gave, with my mom and I had my friend, when I shared and she said, "Oh Maritza, you're being too sensitive about it, if you justify the behavior." You know, I ended up with two problems. I had the original problem and then I had a second one. And it just brings back the issue, I mean it is a friend, you know? But it brings into the issue of that "safe place" where people can really communicate. If you don't have that, of course, I have a safe relationship with my friend. I was able to confront her about that. But sometimes people do not, especially Latinos will not pursue that. I think that that's a, you know, what kind of atmosphere and medium we provide for them for the discourse, I guess. 

00:33:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO I think this last part of it has brought it sort of full circle to look at how we started, from talking about these concepts from Latino points of view and where the cultural values do play a role in this. We have to elevate that because there are nuances in terms of our socialization that allow us to deal, or not deal at times, with these situations. You know, one of the things that I always say when somebody says something to me that I think is off target is consider the source. There are times you can be flip with someone who has made a statement, say "Are you serious?" You kind of bring it down, de-escalate it I guess, when you're feeling... Or you just consider the source and say, do I want to spend time... 

00:34:05
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER Or am I wasting my time? 

00:34:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO You know, I think on all of this, there is ways humor can help deal with it, but again not to in any way invalidate what's going on. 

00:34:20
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER Well, I mean it goes back to the whole theory of what decision you decide to make and that in itself is empowering, so I think that the other issue that we need to reinforce with any person that we deal with microaggressions specifically. 

00:34:35
A Structural Strategy for Ourselves, Others, and for Modeling 

00:34:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah, I think you know, just if, Carlos, now I'm thinking structurally so we identify that it is a microaggression, we acknowledge the feeling, then we evaluate the situation and again, this is again being real cognitive, we evaluate what are my options here and who is the source and then what are the directions I might take. 

00:35:00
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER What are my options? 

00:35:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah, what are my options? And so, it becomes a way that we can all support someone who finds themselves in that circumstance and model it. Consider we will model that in the classroom, model it with the peers. 

00:35:15
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER I do feel that we have an extra responsibility. It's that we need to be really strong and we need to be very clear about these issues within ourselves, because the best way people learn is through modeling. And if they see us and they don't see our despair and they know that we can get empowered, I think we're going to be helping other people deal with the microaggressions. 

00:35:40
