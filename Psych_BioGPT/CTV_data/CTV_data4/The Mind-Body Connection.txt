[music] 

00:00:30
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome. Our topic this evening is the relationship between the body and the mind, and my guest this evening is Dr. Eleanor Criswell, a somatic psychologist, professor of psychology at Sonoma State University, and also the director of the Biotherapeutics and Physical Therapy department of Kentfield Medical Hospital. Eleanor, welcome, it's a pleasure to have you here. 

00:00:55
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL It's a pleasure to be here. 

00:00:55
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know, I'm really fascinated by the whole field of somatics, or somatic psychology. 

00:01:00
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm. 

00:01:00
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE As I understand it, what we're talking about is the relationship between the mind and the body, but not bodywatching as some people might think. 

00:01:10
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm. 

00:01:10
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE But more the notion of how you feel inside, the introspection of your own body. Is that basically right? 

00:01:20
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm, and a kind of integration between your mind and your body's function that can accompany things that you're doing throughout the day. 

00:01:25
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:01:30
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL So it has applications to all areas of human life, actually. 

00:01:35
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE What would be an example of that? 

00:01:35
ELEANOR CRISWELL Ed.D. 

00:01:35
SOMATIC PSYCHOLOGIST 

00:01:35
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Well, in psychology, for example, many times when psychotherapy is being practiced, it may be just a talking therapy which doesn't have anything to do with what we sometimes consider tuning the instrument that you're playing the music on. And so, a somatic psychologist, who puts those together, would include things like biofeedback, um, yoga, practices, visualization, meditation, other martial arts approaches, tai chi, et cetera, to blend the two together. 

00:02:10
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE So the goal is that the body and mind should function smoothly together as one organism. 

00:02:15
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm. 

00:02:15
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE We're not a dualism. 

00:02:20
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right. Many times when we're doing things, we're thinking of something else at the same time and we're not as integrated as we could be, and therefore we're not as effective as we could be. And as human beings, we're capable of incredible things when we really are unified. So we are capable of self-healing, we're capable of creating things that we like to have happen, capable of being more effective. 

00:02:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ph.D 

00:02:45
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE And it's interesting because it seems as if in our culture people have often been taught not to be aware of their body where the body is supposed to take care of itself automatically, it's almost like, what was it, Saint Francis? He called his body "Brother Ass". 

00:03:00
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Oh, I love that. Right, and uh, paying attention to Brother Ass, and taking care of Brother Ass. 

00:03:10
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:03:10
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL So, in the field of somatic psychology where it is applied, it is teaching people how to pay attention to their bodies more effectively, and therefore protect against various health problems, emotional problems, and the problems that come from not being integrated. 

00:03:30
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Now I, recently read a fascinating story of your work at the Kentfield Medical Hospital which seemed to indicate that these approaches, relaxation, stretching, biofeedback enable people who are in chronic pain and often taking narcotic drugs to deal with their pain to stop using those drugs. 

00:03:50
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm. So at Kentfield Medical Hospital in Kentfield, California of course. 

00:03:55
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Nearby. 

00:04:00
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Nearby. They are integrating a variety of disciplines to help people learn how to manage their pain differently. And so those different disciplines are approaching it from both a body and a mind perspective, and including physical therapy, occupational therapy, biotherapeutics, medicine, and regular psychotherapy, and having wonderful effects on people. The thing that's really sort-of tragic about it is some of the things people learn in that time, it would be so nice if they had learned it earlier. 

00:04:35
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:04:35
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL So that they could avoid some of the difficulties that come from not knowing good body mechanics at the work site and home settings. 

00:04:45
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE One of the senses I have had is that in our culture, where drugs are rampant, and now receiving a lot of national attention is that people tend to use drugs as a way of dealing with painful situations, or problem areas, or stress in their lives, and it seems as if what your suggesting is that by getting in touch with your own body that you can accomplish the same end goal without all the harmful by-products of drug use. 

00:05:15
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL True. So one of my areas as a somatic psychologist is in biofeedback training. And so, with biofeedback training, you can learn the skills of self-regulation. So that you can regulate your physiology in a way that reduces headaches, for example, so that you don't need to take lots of aspirin or Tylenol in order to take care of a headache. So that in many difficulties you can either modify the reaction, um, or eliminate it. 

00:05:50
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:05:50
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL And it is a marvelous thing to give a person that kind of control that kind of capacity to create situations and how you are going to react to them. 

00:06:00
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE What led you into this field? 

00:06:00
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Into this field? I have had a long time interest in yoga. And I also had an interest originally in the change in brain activity when learning took place. And so, in my dissertation work I was interested in looking at the effects of visual stimulation on brain activity and then capacity to do things. 

00:06:30
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:06:30
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL And from there I began to be interested in measuring physiological responses, and that led me into being interested in biofeedback in the early days and then from there to teaching it and using it clinically. 

00:06:45
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, see, you're doing two things as a yoga practitioner you're exploring this from the inside. 

00:06:55
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Yes. 

00:06:55
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE As a biofeedback researcher, you're very technical, objective, precise. about it all. 

00:07:00
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm. 

00:07:00
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE What about for the average person? It seems that what you're doing is so complex and in some ways so distant, how can our viewers, for example, begin to understand the applications of somatics or somatic psychology in their own lives? 

00:07:20
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm. 

00:07:20
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Say a person is watching TV. 

00:07:20
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Uh-huh. 

00:07:25
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Would there be a somatic approach to the experience? 

00:07:25
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Well, one of those might be to practice relaxing while you are watching TV. TV itself is somewhat of a relaxant, even with programs that are more strenuous, it's still, because it is so visual and because it is, in a way, a focusing of your attention, getting you away from other things that are happening in your life, there is a tendency to shift toward more relaxed brainwaves while watching television. So it is a bit of a move in that direction, so if the viewer was watching, and paying attention to breathing, and perhaps doing what Vincent talked about in his relaxation response, thinking "One" with the exhale, and then taking another breath, thinking "One" again and keeping that up for something like 15 minutes. There is the relaxation response that comes with that and the shift in physiological response. 

00:08:30
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE So, if those of you who are out there now, watching us, were to begin to enter into that mode of breathing and relaxation probably in 15 minutes or so as the interview progresses, our viewers would be in an altered state somewhat. 

00:08:45
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right, they very well might be. 

00:08:45
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE What would be the value of that? 

00:08:50
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Well, one of the things, there are various physiological changes that go with that, such as a reduction in blood pressure, a change in brainwaves to a more alpha , a change in muscle tension, a change in heart rate. 

00:09:05
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:09:05
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL In respiration. A change in blood flow so that the hands become warmer. 

00:09:10
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Are these changes healthier? 

00:09:10
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL They're very much in healthy directions. Parasympathetic nervous system dominance is our maintenance and repair system, and we wouldn't want to be there all the time, but we need to be able to shift back and forth, uh, when you're more alert, you're more relaxed. 

00:09:30
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE And, in a sense, is that reinforcing or strengthening the immune system of the body? 

00:09:35
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm. 

00:09:35
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE It might be, sort-of, prevention for AIDS? 

00:09:40
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL It could certainly help. 

00:09:40
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:09:40
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Because the immune system is lowered, the functioning is lowered in stress situations. 

00:09:45
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:09:50
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL And so, the more we learn about that, the better. 

00:09:50
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE So one of the aspects of your work then is teaching people how to activate their own immune systems. 

00:09:55
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Quite. And one of my areas of application of somatic psychology has to do with creative health. 

00:10:05
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:10:05
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL And the sense that, you can learn health promoting behaviors, you can achieve a level of health, and you can maintain it throughout various situations in your life, various periods in your life, and that you can take an active role in your health picture, which has to do with the immune system and whether it is getting the best help it can get for you. 

00:10:25
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. And so by being aware of the relaxation response, or by activating the relaxation response that's one major aspect of what you're doing. 

00:10:35
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Yes. 

00:10:35
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:10:35
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Approached in a variety of ways. 

00:10:40
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:10:40
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL So there are many ways enable a person to shift to a parasympathetic nervous system dominance, and we should do it once or twice a day, routinely actually. 

00:10:50
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. You know, one thing that struck me about the research study you reported with the chronic pain patients at Kentfield Medical Hospital is that the number one thing that they found was that was beneficial to them in terms of getting rid of chronic pain was stretching. 

00:11:05
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm. 

00:11:05
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE More than drugs. 

00:11:05
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Uh-huh. 

00:11:10
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE More than ice, more than biofeedback, more than anything else. Can you talk about that? 

00:11:15
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Well, not a lot, but, um, sometimes people do not know that they can stretch. 

00:11:20
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:11:20
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL And so if they are experiencing pain, they are sort of stuck with the pain. 

00:11:30
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Pain as a form of contraction, I suppose. 

00:11:30
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL It does include contraction, as reaction to it and it increases it so therefore there is more of it. So when the person is taught, through physical therapy, to stretch then they can use that as an intervention on their own. So at Kentfield, they are taught about pain, and how pain is managed and various techniques or tools and how to use those at home. 

00:12:00
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:12:00
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL So therefore, after they leave the program, they are encouraged to use those skills whenever they have pain. So stretching is one of the ones that is frequently used. 

00:12:15
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Rather than taking the old painkillers. 

00:12:15
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right! 

00:12:15
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. You know, I myself practice aerobics. 

00:12:20
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm. 

00:12:20
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE And in my case, non-impact aerobics, and I know it's very popular these days for people to be involved in running, or aerobics, or tennis, or various physical activities. Does that relate to somatic psychology? 

00:12:35
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Well it does relate, and where it would be most effective would be a situation where you would pay as much attention to what you are doing as possible. 

00:12:45
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:12:45
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL So that while you are doing your aerobics, you are integrated while you are doing them. You are aware of (crosstalk ) 

00:12:52
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Rather than just waving my arms and legs. 

00:12:52
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right, and lots of repetitions. 

00:12:55
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Because I noticed that I start out by trying to be very aware but as the exercises become more advanced, 

00:13:00
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm. 

00:13:00
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE and I'm breathing heavily, I lose some of that awareness, but I can watch it, 

00:13:05
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm. 

00:13:05
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE as it happens, and I can work with that loss of awareness, and try to bring it back a little bit. I guess that would be along the lines... 

00:13:10
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Yes! And to training your capacity to focus, so that as you noticed you lost it you could bring it back again, and then as time went on you would get better at it. 

00:13:25
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Now let me ask you a tough question. 

00:13:25
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Okay. 

00:13:25
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE We've been talking about the integration of the mind and the body, and the mind and the body as a unitary system. 

00:13:35
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm. 

00:13:35
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE But I know that you also have an interest in parapsychology. I attended a conference you sponsored many years ago on the practical applications of psychic abilities. So many people in parapsychology take the dualistic view, that the mind hovers above or around the body. 

00:13:50
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Uh-huh. 

00:13:50
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE That it's separate from it. How do you deal with that? 

00:13:55
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Well, I think of it as a field, um, that both is coming from the body and is intimately intertwined with it. So that our mind field has the capacity to reach far beyond our physiology. Not only far beyond it, but also in time so that we are frequently scanning ahead into the future to know whats going to be happening. And so, um, I notice a blend between the mind and the physiology. You might say the body, mind, and spirit integration. 

00:14:35
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. Well now, from the point of view of somatics, let's say a person tends to be quite psychic. Maybe they even think of themselves as a little mentally ill. 

00:14:45
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Hmm. 

00:14:45
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Because they're spacing out a lot, moving into the past, into the future. 

00:14:45
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm. Right. 

00:14:50
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Over into the neighbor's house. 

00:14:50
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right, ha! 

00:14:50
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Is this healthy? 

00:14:50
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Well, it can be. 

00:14:55
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:14:55
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL It depends on what kind of sense the person has of what they're doing. So in my own private practice, occasionally I have clients for whom that is a problem. And their task, then, is to learn how to differentiate when they are really so empathic with other people that they are getting confused over whose goals are operating here. And when I am at my best in this situation, or when I've totally lost myself in it, um, and so it can be healthy but I would think that training the physiology, getting the person as centered as possible would enable them to be as healthy as possible with the natural tendancies human beings have to sense in situations when all is well. Am I safe here, you know, what's going to be happening. 

00:15:50
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE So you seem to be saying that developing psychic abilities can be healthy and a positive thing but maybe one way to really do it right is to start by being in touch with the body. 

00:16:00
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Yeah. I think so. And for people who have a tendency to be extended off in various directions, one of the very good things to do with that is to bring it back to the body, because that really does help to integrate and focus the person on the present. So we can do some things with brainwave training to help people integrate, you know there are times to be very integrated, and there are times to be a little bit more loosely integrated. 

00:16:30
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. Well, what's the advantage to being loosely integrated? 

00:16:35
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Well, one of those advantages, one of the pain management approaches is for the person to slightly disconnect from the experience. For example, when alpha brainwave training is used for pain management, what the person is doing is seperating just a little bit from the intensity of the situation. 

00:16:55
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:16:55
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL So that, yes, there is the pain, but, it doesn't matter as much. 

00:17:00
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words, you can kind of step outside of your body. 

00:17:00
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm. 

00:17:00
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE If you need to, for that. 

00:17:05
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right. And I think one of Jack Schwartz's approaches to pain management or whatever... 

00:17:10
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE This is the fellow who puts needles through his arms? 

00:17:10
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right. That was to say "The arm", and to talk about "The arm" instead of "My arm". "My arm" hurts more than "The arm". Sometimes, particularly in yoga, there are some meditative states in which you are just a little bit less intensely connected to events, which is nice from time to time, to have a little break from the intensity of it, to be able to integrate, and also able to separate just a little bit. 

00:17:45
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE So it sounds like then what you're saying is that you're not advocating mind-body unity or mind-body duality, but a kind of mental flexibility that allows... 

00:17:55
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL I would, yeah, I would recommend that, because there are various situations in which we need to be able to be flexible. Um, an example of that is many times, people have felt that alpha training was wonderful. I'd like to be in alpha all the time. But actually we need to be able to be in beta and alpha. We need to be able to be focused, or relaxed. 

00:18:15
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Beta is a more high-speed brainwave. 

00:18:20
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right, it's the awake, alert brainwave pattern. 

00:18:25
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

00:18:25
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL And so to be able to focus when it's time to focus, and to be relaxed when it's time to be relaxed. To have flexibility. So, that's what I would encourage people to do. 

00:18:35
ELEANOR CRISWELL Ed.D. SOMATIC PSYCHOLOGIST 

00:18:35
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Now let's suppose that some of our viewers had started the relaxation response with us about 15 minutes ago, by now they are in this altered state of consciousness, perhaps. Could we address that in some way, perhaps our viewers are in a more relaxed state than when we began, what would you want to do with that? 

00:18:55
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Well, I might want to suggest to myself something that I wanted to tell to myself. And I would want to suggest something that was positive, and that was somewhat open-ended perhaps something having to do with goals that I had, things that I was working on in my life, something about my potential as a person. 

00:19:20
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Affirmations? 

00:19:20
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Could be, like affirmations. 

00:19:25
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE I love myself unconditionally. 

00:19:25
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Like it was recommended in a recent book I read, "Women Who Love Too Much" one way to start with it was to say to yourself "I love you very much as you are" or something like that. 

00:19:40
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:19:40
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Some kind of suggestion to yourself that you would like to receive on a deep level. 

00:19:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ph.D 

00:19:45
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words, in this particular state of consciousness, which some of our viewers may be in, very relaxed, if they've been doing some breathing and relaxation at the start, suggestions that are given have more impact, they go deeper, we're more receptive, we're more open to them. 

00:20:00
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm.Mm-hmm. 

00:20:05
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE So it's an opportunity to really do some positive programming. 

00:20:10
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Definitely. And I think there's a great deal that we can do to positively program ourselves for different situations. An example of that is visualization. You can do incredible things with your own situation if you will stop to visualize how you would like to have it happen. 

00:20:30
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:20:30
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL So you can prepare yourself to be receptive to it when you're in it. 

00:20:35
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE It could be a social event? 

00:20:35
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL It could be a social event. 

00:20:35
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Or something you might be afraid of? You might be able to imagine yourself enjoying that event. 

00:20:40
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right! 

00:20:40
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Instead of having a bad time. 

00:20:45
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right. Many times we go into situations expecting the worst and we fulfill our prophecy. 

00:20:50
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:20:50
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL So if you stop and visualize how you would like to have it turn out, at it's best, there's a great likelihood you will allow it to happen that way. Rather than second-guessing it in another fashion. 

00:21:05
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE I would think maybe for some viewers if they really wanted to go deeper with this technique they might begin visualizing their own body, 

00:21:10
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Hmmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:21:10
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE at this point, for example, healing, 

00:21:15
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right. 

00:21:15
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Parts of their body. 

00:21:15
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Body being well, and whole. 

00:21:15
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:21:20
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL And, um, fully functioning, comfortable. 

00:21:25
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE There are certain particular visualizations you might work with if a person was injured in a certain part of the body? 

00:21:30
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL You can. One of the ways of doing visualizations, there are a couple of ways, and one of those would be to allow them to visualize, uh, a healing process that is unique to them. 

00:21:40
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:21:40
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Um, sometimes from the Simonton approach visualizing some, some characteristic way of seeing the disease-fighting entities at work. 

00:21:50
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE The little white blood cells riding horses and...(laughs) 

00:21:55
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right, attacking. Other ways of visualizing might include, like, we sometimes do at Kentfield, an endorphin release process. Where you, uh, visualize endorphins coming out. 

00:22:05
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Let's talk about endorphins for a moment. I know that they're very important and for the last ten years they've probably been the major area of scientific research, but many of our viewers may not understand them. 

00:22:15
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Hmm. Mm-hmm. So these are the indigenous morphine-like molecules that we produce. 

00:22:25
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE They create a euphoric state? 

00:22:25
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Uh-huh. They are pain managers. 

00:22:30
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE And they manage pain. And unlike drugs that we might take, they're produced right in the body. 

00:22:35
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right. 

00:22:35
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE So they're much healthier, they're better. 

00:22:35
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right. 

00:22:35
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE And they can be activated using visualization. 

00:22:40
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right. And they tell us meditation, and they also say running as well. 

00:22:45
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Oh yes. So let's suppose that I'm doing this program right now, I'm in a relaxed state, I've been giving myself positive affirmations, now maybe I'd like a little hit of endorphins. What would I do next? 

00:22:55
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right. Well, you might imagine that your endorphins are present. 

00:23:05
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:23:05
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL And you can imagine them in various forms. 

00:23:05
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:23:05
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL I mean, give them an interesting look there. 

00:23:10
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

00:23:10
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL They don't have to look like an endorphin actually might look. 

00:23:10
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Like little guys running around? 

00:23:15
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Or yeah. 

00:23:15
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Or little gals. 

00:23:15
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Little happy, little friendly beings. And imagine, visualize them coming in and doing their thing for you. Coming in and... 

00:23:25
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Making you feel euphoric? 

00:23:30
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Making you feel - and then feel the feeling of comfort. (laughs) 

00:23:30
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. It probably makes some people want to kiss the TV set. 

00:23:35
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL (laughs) That's possible! I don't know of any research that actually supports the validity of that, but it is certainly a subjective experience that many people have had. As if you had a choice to increase your endorphin levels at will. 

00:23:50
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE I recall in the study that you wrote, which I might mention, incidentally, is in a journal called "Somatics" of which you are the managing editor. 

00:24:00
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right. 

00:24:00
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Which is a journal for people in every area of mind-body interaction. 

00:24:05
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:24:05
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Body workers, massage, biofeedback, dance therapy. 

00:24:10
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm. 

00:24:10
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE And so on, yoga. 

00:24:10
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Martial arts. 

00:24:10
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Martial arts. These are all sort of integrated under the term somatics. 

00:24:15
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Uh-huh. 

00:24:15
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE All these things you're doing. 

00:24:15
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right. So the magazine is research, practice, and theoretical articles. 

00:24:20
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

00:24:20
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL About those different approaches to integrating mind and body. 

00:24:30
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE And I might say, I found it very profound, even from a philosophical point of view. 

00:24:30
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Yeah. 

00:24:30
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE And full of beautiful poetry. 

00:24:35
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Yes. 

00:24:35
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE As well as a wonderful poem in the most recent issue, a fellow who had cerebral palsy, who described his journeys all over the world, and all the people he met, and all the things he was doing that you would never expect someone with cerebral palsy to do. 

00:24:50
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right. You wouldn't necessarily recognize that from the outside. 

00:24:50
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:24:55
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL The inner richness, which is there. Uh-huh. 

00:24:55
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE So that's really a large focus of your work then. Even with people who have severe handicaps... 

00:25:00
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right. I work with people all the way from persons who simply want to function more effectively and stay healthy, to people who are recovering from serious illnesses and injuries, and so forth. Either I'm working with them directly or indirectly supervising people who are working with them. 

00:25:20
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE And while the research literature may not support the activation of endorphins, 

00:25:25
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right. 

00:25:25
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE it seems to be so in your work. 

00:25:30
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right, the subjective experience of the different practices you may have had. Biofeedback, for example, seems to give people tools they can use in their everyday life. 

00:25:40
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, Eleanor, we're going to be concluding the program in just about two minutes, how would you, if you wanted to tie all of this together for our viewers, some of who may be in quite an altered state at this point, what would be your concluding message to these people. 

00:25:55
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Well, that your own body-mind comfort is something that you have a right to. And nobody in society is going to be paying close attention to that in a way you can. And so it is your right to achieve that comfort and maintain it. And to maintain it throughout your life so that you have an effective utilization of your potential in this lifetime. 

00:26:25
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE That is everybody's right. 

00:26:25
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Yes.(nods) 

00:26:25
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. In spite of anything that might be going on externally. 

00:26:30
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right. So take the right. No one else will be working to ensure it for you. You're the one who is going to have to take that right. 

00:26:40
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, you seem to really be standing up for internal psychic liberation. 

00:26:40
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mmm. Mm-hmm. Right? Yeah. 

00:26:45
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE The right of people to really control their own internal experience. 

00:26:50
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right. 

00:26:50
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know we have every kind of liberation. 

00:26:50
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL That's right. 

00:26:55
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Social movements and so one. In fact, you were the one, as I recall, who coined the term "psychic liberation". 

00:27:00
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Right. 

00:27:00
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Many years ago. 

00:27:00
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL That's true. 

00:27:00
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. And really, you're carrying it on to this work now aren't you? 

00:27:05
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Mm-hmm. (nods) 

00:27:05
DR. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Eleanor, it has been really a pleasure to spend this time with you, and for those of you who have been watching, viewing, and maybe entering into an altered state of consciousness and controlling your own inner space as well, thank you very much for being with us, and thank you. 

00:27:20
DR. ELEANOR CRISWELL Thank you.
