THE SCIENCE AND CREATION OF FIDELITY AND INFIDELITY 

00:00:00
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay, welcome. Welcome-- presentation. If you are-- on. You're interested in hearing, ah, about dialectical behavior therapy with Marsha Linehan, you're in the wrong room and that's just across the hall in the California ballroom. And we're gonna be talking about, uhm, the science and creation of, uhm, how fidelity and infidelity is created in relationships. Can I have the slide please? Thank you. 

00:00:35
WE NEED A SCIENCE OF FIDELITY TO UNDERSTAND INFIDELITY • You cannot develop a science of infidelity without also understanding the science of fidelity, loyalty, continuing love, and trust • Therefore we must understand how couples build (or erode) TRUST • Therefore we must understand how couples either build LOYALTY or how they build BETRAYAL • We must understand the principles of INTIMATE TRUST, lasting romance, passion, and love, as well as their erosion. TO ACCOMPLISH THAT WE DEFINED AND VALIDATED THREE METRICS: • The TRUST METRIC • The FAIRNESS METRIC, and • The BETRAYAL METRIC • All three METRICS need to be considered in the equation for life-long committed fidelity and romance LOVE IN A LIFETIME HAS THREE STAGES • STAGE 1: Falling in love: limmerance • STAGE 2: Building trust • STAGE 3: Building commitment and loyalty STAGE 1: The Physiology of Falling In Love- Only Certain People Can Trigger the Limmerance Cocktail Cascade - and it's a complex constellation. • DHEA (dehydro-epiandrosterone), natural amphetamine high, readiness for sex; • Pheromones, sex scents, smell and attraction; Oxytocin, touch, s/he feels just right to hold, the cuddle hormone, bonding, also reduces fear and reduces good judgment; • PEA (phenyl-ethyl-amine) spikes at ovulation - regulates approach and romance, hormone of love at first sight, highs of limmerance; • Estrogen, softness, receptivity • Testosterone, aggressive sexual desire, lust, horny-ness, roaming for new sex; • Serotonin, emotional sensitivity, low irritability • Dopamine, excitement, pleasure, motivation, risk taking, anticipation of reward; • Progesterone, sedating, can be calming, needs inhibition; • Prolactin, reduces aggression, increases nurturance; • Vasopressin, monogamy molecule, aggressive possessiveness in males.

JOHN GOTTMAN Uhm, so Dr. Julie Schwartz Gottman and then I, my wife and I will be presenting this together and I wanna make it very clear that, ah, all of these ideas and concepts are part of a partnership and collaboration. Ah, I am the Vulcan and Julie is the heart. Ah, so, so the first point that I wanna make on this slide is that in order to understand infidelity and understand how to treat couples who are trying to recover from extramarital affair, we need to have also a science of fidelity. Uhm, when-- and this is very similar to the point that Don Meichenbaum made yesterday in a presentation that Julie and I both attended about post traumatic stress disorder in which what Don was saying was that the overwhelming reaction to trauma is resilience. How 75% of people when they encounter a trauma, really respond by being resilient and 25% really develop a post traumatic stress reaction. And there's nothing wrong with those people but what Don's point was, was in order to know how to treat, ah, people who are suffering from PTSD we need to understand how people resiliently respond to stress. And part of what Don Meichenbaum was presenting was were these wonderful interviews of, ah, former soldiers who were-- had amputations and were recovering from that amputation and seeing how resilience is created. So the point of this slide really very similar point that, uhm, if you wanna really understand infidelity we need to understand how fidelity, loyalty and trust and continuing love are created in relationships. So we therefore-- we have to understand how couples actually build or erode trust and how couple build loyalty, loyalty in a relationship, ah, or how the build the trail. So, that's really the point right? Uhm, and to do that, now here's-- this is the Vulcan in me and I promise I won't infer there's too much mathematics in this presentation. I started life as a mathematician and, ah, and then when I went to MIT I had a roommate who was studying psychology. So I switched, ah, fields in midstream. But part of what we need to do in order to really understand this, I thought was to create what I'm calling a trust metric. A way of measuring trust in relationships and measuring it in, in actual interaction that couples have. And also way of measuring fairness because trust is very hard to create trust in an atmosphere of inequality and dominance. I mean, think about, ah, any kind of relationship you've had with a teacher or a physician or a boss. You know, where there is a sense of equality and fairness really much more importantly in intimate relationships, then trust is much more easier to establish. And then a metric, a separate way of measuring betrayal in every relationship and not only do you have to develop these measures but you gotta show that they're valid. That they actually, actually measure what their, what you, what you're intending to measure. So the goal, ah, really was to understand love and what I wanna suggest to you is the theory that love in a lifetime of love has actually three different stages and we know a lot about the first stage, ah, falling in love and limmerance. And I'm not saying that, that all stages are necessary. Uhm, and, and I'm not saying that all relationships actually go through all three stages. Some relationships never go through any of these stages and there's still relationships. Uhm, and of course there are arranged, ar-- arranged marriages, arranged relationships that really never go through stage one in, ah, in modern westernized society where we really are selecting people as they did in ancient Rome if you were upper class, ah, by falling in love. And then the second stage is a stage of building trust and the third stage and, you know, this is sort of a new idea, is that we also have a stage where we build commitment and loyalty and long lasting romance and passion in a relationship. So I want to tell you about these three stages. Now, this slide has got a lot of information about it. But don't worry, all of these slides are-- you can download from the, ah, Evolution of Psychotherapy website so you don't have to take notes on this. Uhm, and the physiology of falling in love is so interesting because first of all, not everybody can trigger this cascade of hormones and neurotransmitters. The person we fall in love with has to really smell right and taste right and feel right, and feel right when you hold her right in your arms or him in your arms. And I know, ah, before I met, ah, the love of my life, ah, Julie Gottman, I, ah, I arrived in Seattle and I, I went through a process cuz I-- school didn't start until October. I dated 60 women and I spent about two months having one date after the other and most of these people, you know, I really couldn't even talk to and, ah, and they didn't like my sense of humor at all now. And then I, and then I met Julie and, uhm, and when she walked into the Pony Espresso shop... I was hoping it was her and it was her and it was so easy to talk and, you know, and, and we laughed so easily together and, and of course, you know, we didn't kiss right away and that, that happened later but sure enough when we did, you know, she, she smelled right and tasted right. I was, I was totally gone. Uhm, and-- so what's the cascade of hormones and neurotransmitters that was going on in my body after I met Julie? I secreted DHEA, uhm, which is a natural amphetamine that we secrete and, you know, I was ready for sex, okay. All I, all I got was coffee though, ah. She smelled right. The pheromones were right. Ah, I was attracted. As we talked more and more I secreting oxytocin. Oxytocin is an, is an amazing hormone because oxytocin is Greek for rapid birth and oxytocin is what women secrete when they give birth to a new life and, ah, of course I laid her. Had, had the, the incredible pleasure of being there when our daughter was born and, ah, fell in love instantly with her. Ah, oxytocin is also the hormone of the milk let-down response when women are lactating, right, when they're, when they're nursing. And it requires some calm for oxytocin to be secreted. By the way, oxytocin gets secreted if two guys are having coffee and enjoying their conversation. They're both secreting oxytocin. Now, we men also secrete another hormone of bonding called the vasopressin that is down at the bottom of this list. The vasopressin is the monogamy hormone so if you secrete, ah, if you inject vasopressin into the brain of a, uhm, a prairie vole that is completely polygamous, that little rodent will become a monogamist and mate for life. So vasopressin, really interesting. When we secrete that, we guys secrete that but it makes us aggressively possessive. So rats who sec-- male rats who secrete vasopressin after and orgasm are already trying to ward off potential rivals. Well oxytocin reduces fear but it also eliminates good judgment. So, ah, a study done in Switzerland where they sprayed oxytocin up people's noses, uhm, versus sailing and they gave them a whole bunch of money. Then they had this well dressed Swiss banker come in and say to them, "Ah if you give me your money I will, I will quadruple or I may decide to just keep It. And if you have had oxytocin pried up your nose, you think that's a good deal." No? So we secrete oxytocin immediately after an orgasm. So having orgasms early in a relationship eliminates good judgment. So we don't see the red flag, you know, that people are sending out in this falling in love phase because of oxytocin. PEA is another hormone. It spikes at ovulation, it regulates approach in romance, it's the hormone of falling in love at first sight. That happened to me when I met Julie. Estrogen really is about sexuality but it's a, it's a female hormone that we secrete also, we guys and-- but its about softness and recep-- receptivity. Testosterone is about aggressive sexuality and lust, horny-ness, roaming for new partners and Serotonin, you want that low when you're falling in love. Ah, cuz, well, you don't want to be irritable but you also don't wanna think a lot and dopamine, the hormone of excitement and pleasure and the anticipation of something wonderful is about to happen. Of course that's the way it feels like when you fall in love. Something wonderful is about to happen. It is happening and prolactin which, which reduces aggression and makes you nurture and, and kind. So as you can see, ah, falling in love is like, is like a diamond, like a jewel that has all these different facets. We're receptive, we're soft, we're aggressive. We're tender, we're lustful, we're horny, we have bad judgment, we're romantic, we project things on our partners, that's what falling in love is like and only certain people can trigger this cascade. 

00:12:25
THERE ARE ONLY SOME PEOPLE WHO QUALIFY IN EACH STAGE • Only some people will be selected by our bodies (Kaheman "System 1") as potential candidates for a relationship. • STAGE 1: The cocktail cascade of falling in love in our body We ignore the red flags - Oxytocin (after orgasms) creates bad judgment • STAGE 2: As the relationship proceeds the poor judgment haze produced by oxytocin, dopamine, and testosterone FADES, and • We begin seeing red flags (Kahneman System 2) and • Then we attempt to build TRUST PHASE 2: BUILDING TRUST ESSENTIAL QUESTION IS: Are You There For Me? PHASE 3 OF LOVE: BUILDING LOYALTY VS. BETRAYAL • THE LOYALTY QUESTIONS ARE: - Will you make a life-long commitment to our relationship? - Will you put a wide fence between yourself and other potential relationships? - Will you sacrifice and invest to build and maintain this relationship? MAIN RESEARCH QUESTION: How do couples build or erode trust? 

00:12:25
JOHN GOTTMAN Its a complex constellation and in only certain people who qualify at each stage of the three stage, ah, theory that I'm suggesting to you. And by the way, ah, ah, Daniel Kahneman who, uhm, who wrote a book called Thinking Fast and Slow which is a bestseller now, ah, System 1 thinking is about what, what, ah, ah, Michael Gladwell(ph) talked about in Blink. Its thinking fast and its often very accurate and its often totally inaccurate. And it-- but it-- it's rational thinking which is much slower a system to thinking. Well, we're much more like, did it do system one thinking in the first stage of falling in love. Ah, and, you know, and oxytocin, just one example of bad judgment. Now a-- sta-- what about stage two? Well, as the relationship proceeds, the haze created by oxytocin, dopamine and testosterone fades and then we begin seeing the red flags. Kahneman system two kicks in and we go, "Oh my god, what have I done?" We have some biased(ph) remorse in this second phase, right. And, and all of the arguments that people have in a new relationship are all about building trust. So 130 newlyweds that I studied in my lab are a couple of months after the wedding, what are they fighting about? They're fighting about, "Can I trust you?" Uhm, and the essential question in trust very much like Susan Johnson talks about is, are you there for me? Will you be there for me? That's the question in building trust. Now phase three of love is about building a loyalty versus betrayal and what I wanna tell you is people systematically build betrayal in a relationship or they systematically build loyalty and the loyalty questions are, you know, will you make a lifelong commitment to me? They're about commitment. Will you put a wide fence between yourself and other potential relationships? Will you sacrifice and invest to build and maintain this relationship? Right, it's not just, "Are you gonna be there for me? Do I have a safety net?" But it's really like, "Can I count on this forever?" And the main research question really is, "How do, how do couples build or erode trust? How do they build or erode loyalty, ah, in a relationship?" And these are the two books that I wrote about this. Ah, The Science of Trust and What Makes Love Last, uhm, and What Makes Love Last was written with Nan Silver. 

00:15:10
LET'S NOW TALK ABOUT TRUST, COMMITMENT, & BETRAYAL The Sound Relationship House Create Shared Meaning make Life Dreams Come True Manage Conflict • Accept Your Partner's Influence • Dialogue About Problems • Practice Self-Soothing The Positive Perspective Turn Towards Instead of Away Share Fondness and Admiration Build Love Maps • Know One Another's World 

00:15:10
JOHN GOTTMAN So let's talk about trust, commitment, and betrayal. And before we talk about that, uhm, I want to, ah, just go over one slide that is the basis of everything that we do at the Gottman Institute and that Julie and I do, uhm, in working with couples either in workshops and in training therapies as well and therapy with couples. And Julie's gonna come up here and go through this theory that we have called the Sound Relationship House Theory. And by the way, it's also based on studying gay and lesbian committed relationships for a dozen years that I did with Robert Levenson, my, ah, research collaborator. And Julie and I created this theory together. It is not the-- my mind, ah, it required not only a Vulcan but also a very compassionate therapist, ah, to create this theory. 

00:16:10

00:16:20
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Isn't he the sweetest man ever? Can you see why I married him? He's so wonderful. So let's talk about the Sound Relationship House, uhm, let's bring that up, thank you. So here's what the Sound Relationship House is composed of. These are particular interactions between couples, between partner that really build strength, resilience, warmth, trust, and love in the relationship. Forgive me for perhaps being a repetition for many of you because you may know these pieces but let me go over each one in turn. The bottom level, we call Build Love Maps. Here's what we mean by that. Love maps are your knowledge, information, awareness of your partner's inner world. Who is your partner? What was their most embarrassing moment in childhood? What's their favorite movie? Do they believe in god and what is their concept of god? The interaction that strengthens love maps is asking our partners questions and then very important for those of us who are getting older everyday. Remember the answer, that's very important. Okay, the second level we call Share Fondness and Admiration. Now the interesting thing about this, and I hear this from lots of couples, is that he should know that I love him. She should already get it. I've told her that. Well, the reality is that when it comes to love, we need it like water. We need to drink it everyday and in order to drink it, our partners need to manifest it which means we need to express it to our partners, it needs to come out of our mouths, out of our fingertips. We need to shower our partners with love, with respect, with cherishing and we need to let them know that we love them everyday. Otherwise, our partners will forget and wonder as we all do with our self-doubt. I wonder if they're feelings have changed, I wonder is she really doesn't love me or see me anymore. So very important to express it. The next level Turn Towards Instead of Away. This is an incredibly important piece. We learned about this by watching couples in an apartment lab for 24 hours at a time and in the lab it was just like a B&B. It had a lovely bed, a little kitchenette. I got to decorate it which was wonderful. It had a couch and so on and it was just like the B&B except that there were four cameras bolted to the walls. We took people's urine samples every time they urinated, we took their blood pressure. There was a one way glass with observers behind it but other than that it was just like a B&B, right? Okay, so what we noticed is that when partners made a bid for attention, how will their partners respond? Let's say one person would say, "Wow, look at that! There's this beautiful boat. Oh, my god, it's incredible." Now, the other partner has three choices. The other partner who's reading could go... No response. We call that turning away. Or the partner could do this. Could put down the book and say, "Would you stop interrupting me? I'm trying to read!" Turning against. Or the third partner could go, "Huh, wow." That's all it takes. That makes the difference. All the difference between whether or not couples believe their partner is a friend or an enemy. They feel known or unknown. Turning towards versus away or against is that response to bids for connection, responding to needs, seeing your partner and turning towards the incredibly important nuts and bolts, little, tiny gestures of attention to the partner that make a huge difference in the sustenance of the relationship. It's like food. Okay, the next level, we call The Positive Perspective. Now, this, this level is not one in which you can actually work on it in therapy. It is a given based on either the quality of the first three levels of the sound relationship house which create friendship, romance, union, teamwork, and passion as well as the upper levels of the sound relationship house with half, which have to do more with processing conflict. The positive perspective, was a concept developed by Robert Weiss. What it means is do you give your partner the benefit of the doubt? That's a positive perspective. For example, if you wake up in the morning, your partner's very, very, very grumpy and you think to yourself, "What a jerk! Why does she have to be such an idiot at first thing? I'm so fragile in the morning." Why is that partner being such a jerk? Okay, we call that negative, negative perspective. Does that make sense? Yes it does. Okay, or let's say same partner, very, very grumpy, very like, "Oh my god! You know, why didn't you even make the bed? What's the matter with you? You just got up and left." Okay, the other partner may also say, "Man, she must have had a bad night's sleep. Whoa, poor thing, she must feel pretty ragged this morning. I think I'll kind of walk around her for a while. Kind of cut a wide swath around her and maybe she'll feel better later." That's the positive perspective. Do you give your partner the benefit of the doubt. Does that make sense? Yeah. Okay, the next level, Managing Conflict. Now, this one is very interesting. Notice it's not eliminate conflict. Managing conflict is a whole another story. Every couple has conflict. What they do with it determines the strength of the relationship. John identified in his beautiful research several very predictive, powerful factors especially involving conflict that are very disruptive to the relationship. The four horsemen of the apocalypse, right; war, famine, pestilence, and divorce, that's the fourth. So what are they? Well, they're criticism, criticism. Blaming the partner's personality or some character trait for a problem. Contempt, contempt is looking down on the partner from a place on high. Superiority and putting down the partner with contempt, with a little sneer or disgust. I'm sure if you have teenagers you've seen it. It's the eye roll, like, "Oh, my god, really?" Contempt is not only corrosive to the relationship. It also destroys the listener's immune system. It predicts how many infectious illnesses the listener of contempt will have over the next year. Very powerful. How do you respond to criticism and contempt? You get defensive. Defensiveness is the third okay. Defensive is, "I did too empty the dishwasher" kind of a victim or "Oh, yeah? Well you didn't pay the bills." Counter attack, defensiveness in another big predictor and finally stonewalling which is when one partner completely shuts out the other partner refusing to give them any response at all. Not even a head nod, okay. And what John's research found is that was related to physiological flooding which is just astounding. Heart rates while people are sitting there with heart rates about above 140 beats a minute, 120 beats a minute and they're just sitting there having a nice talk. Who would have thunk it except taking their heart rate. So, that interferes with all conflict management. So in conflict management, what we do is give people alternative ways of talking to one another of processing conflict and of moving towards compromise. That takes us again to the next level, Making Life Dreams Come True. This is also part of conflict and I'll tell you why. John found that 69% of all problems that couples have are perpetual problems. They never go away, they never get solved. Isn't that wonderful? That's why Salvador Minuchin can say every marriage is at stake. It is right? We're not marrying, you know, the perfect partner so there's always gonna be perpetual problems that go on forever because they're based in differences in lifestyle preferences, choices and personality variables. So with those, what we found was gold, pure gold. Existentially, every person is a dreamer, every person is a philosopher, every person has a profound belief in something that they're yearning for. We found that at the heart of perpetual gridlock conflict were these unspoken dreams beneath the surface that had everything to do with why a person could not move towards some kind of center place. If they gave up that dream, they were giving up the bones of their body. So we created interventions having to do with honoring each other's dreams, incredibly important, that are right at the heart of processing conflict. Finally, the last level Creating Shared Meaning. Here again, we go back into that existential layer. People have meanings they attribute to every nuance of their experience. They bring into relationships the culture that they grew up with. Even same color, same background, same religion, same kind of value system, still their family cultures will differ. So when they come together, they're creating a brand new culture in their own new family and as a result they have to have a way of talking about; What is meaningful to me? What is my sense of purpose in life? Why am I living? Which is one of the things that we ask couples in our couples workshop. So what we try to create with the sound relationship house is in summary a relationship in which friendship moves from the smallest little nuts and bolts all the way to sharing and creating one sense of life purpose. That's our sound relationship house. Thank you. 

00:31:25

00:31:30
JOHN GOTTMAN I can see why I love her. Ah, okay so, uhm, this sound relationship house, ah, Julie and I designed it to be a theory that is, is confirmable and we've, we've learned some things about it that are surprising and we've also, ah, learned some things that, ah, disconfirmed our ideas cuz we thought that the positive perspective that Bob Weiss suggested, ah,-- as you can see, you know, ah, in creating this theory we were, uhm, we were shameless plagiarists. Ah, we stole from everybody, we stole good ideas from everybody so is really a very integrative theory, ah, and if you take, ah,-- can I have that slide back again, the sound relationship house? Ah, there are now two weight bearing walls for this house and they're about trust and commitment and that's what I want to talk to you about next. How we've really modified this theory, okay. 

00:32:25
TRUST IS VERY IMPORTANT, BUT WHAT IS "TRUST"? • Is trust a trait, a belief, a value? • does trust = morality? • "social capital" on trust research never defined trust • If you can't define it, you can't change it • Smaller social unit, one interaction at a time • Use game theory to understand trust RP Payout Nash Nodes decision Game player equilibrium players action Option Normal point extensive information set another bimatrix form one strategy opponent CP consider one form Theory situation following example might strategies possible GAME THEORY CAN BE A GENERAL THEORY OF ALL SOCIAL INTERACTIONS • If I smiled at my wife and she smiled back at me • I may highly value that return smile, and assign a high payoff to that return smile, thinking, "What a great smile! I am one lucky guy to have her as my wife." • Or I may be disappointed by the return smile, assigning a low payoff to that smile, thinking. "I think I could do better elsewhere." GAME THEORY CAN SUGGEST: • How to create trust, betrayal, and fairness metrics, • Can be computed in any interaction .• Not as traits, but at a micro level, using temporal dynamics. Game Theory Assumes Player's Rational Self-Interest • Each player seeks to maximize his or her payoffs in any transaction • Players select the strategy that maximizes their own pay offs. • Harold Kelley's simple experiment (1979): 100 couples rated how much they valued housework. • Let's look at one couple, Al and Jenny 

00:32:25
JOHN GOTTMAN So, ah, trust is very important but, ah, what is trust? I mean, is it trait? Is it a belief? Is a value? Ah, does trust equal morality? Uhm, ah, social capital research on trust, you know, looking at trust in, in, ah, communities and looking at trust across different states and now across different countries never really define trust. They just ask people if, if they trust other people. Well, you know, if you can't define then you can't change it. So we need a smaller social unit for looking at trust. That's what, that's what I was thinking. One interaction at a time and for that we use a theory called game theory and game theory has been the basis not only of social psychology, a lot of social psychology and psychology but it's also the basis of a whole new field called neuroeconomics. So let's take a look at what game theory is about. It's all over, ah, decision, ah, making and, ah, you know, the development of games but also it's, it's a general theory of all social interactions. So, so what's the basis of this theory. Every complicated-- if I smile at Julie and she smiles back at me I might really value that return smile which means, you know, I basically am, am assigning a high pay off. Pay off is one of the terms in game theory. You know, I'm thinking, "What a great smile! I'm really one lucky guy to have her as my wife." Or I might be disappointed by the return smile, assigning a low pay off to it, thinking, "I could do better elsewhere." Okay, so that's basically game theory. Now, so game theory actually can, can be used to suggest these metrics that I mentioned on trust, betrayal, and fairness and it can be defined at the micro level at every interaction. Ah, now game theory assumes that players who are rational are operating out of self-interest. You know, the assumption there is kind of a philosophical assumption that every player playing a game, ah, chess or checkers or, or world of warcraft-- any of these games, but real interaction as well between nations, between, ah, companies. Any, any unit, people are trying to maximize their pay offs in any transactions and they select the strategy that maximizes their own pay offs. But in intimate relationships that may be very different. Now Harold Kelley, a social psychologist who brought game theory into psychology con-- constructed a very simple experiment. 

00:35:15
A YOUNG COUPLE RATES HOUSEWORK (0 - BAD TO 10 = GOOD) JENNY'S PAYOFFS JENNY CLEANS JENNY DOESN'T AL CLEANS 10 4 14 AL DOESN'T 2 0 2 12 4 16 AL'S PAYOFFS JENNY CLEANS JENNY DOESN'T AL CLEANS 8 2 10 AL DOESN'T 7 2 9 15 4 19 WITH THE SELF-INTEREST METRIC, JENNY WILL TRY TO CHANGE AL AND AL WILL TRY TO CHANGE JENNY • Therefore, Jenny & Al will fight tooth and nail about housework. Typical of unhappily married couples. BUT IF WE DEFINE TRUST AS THE METRIC IN WHICH: • Jenny is trying to maximize Al's payoffs, and Al is also trying to maximize Jenny's payoffs, • Then they will each decide to clean together, logically arriving at the maximum pay off for both. (THE "NASH EQUILIBRUIM") CONCLUSION IS: • TRUST = HAVING OUR PARTNER'S BACK, NOT JUST OUR OWN. • Can we generalize Kelly's work as a game theory approach for all interactions? Answer is YES WE CAN! HERE'S HOW - GOTTMAN-LEVENSON PARADIGM: 

00:35:15
JOHN GOTTMAN And let's take a look at this one couple and their names are Al and Jenny for the purposes of this example. Now, this is the only math that I'll, ah, I'll use is this talk. So, ah, stay with me for a moment. Don't freak out. It's just arithmetic and, ah, and what you see there are two tables. One is, ah, this is based on how they rate housework. This is what Harold Kelley did with a hundred couples. He asked them to rate four possibilities. So Jenny was rating from either zero was bad or 10 was great. Uhm, what happens, like in the first, ah, upper left hand table, if both of them are cleaning together, cleaning the apartment together, Jenny gave that a 10. So that was great. But what if Al does the cleaning and Jenny doesn't. The next over table to the right. She only gave that a four, right. So she probably didn't think that Al would do a good job cleaning. She probably right cuz most guys don't clean very thoroughly compared to women. So guys who live with one another alone, ah, are a lot messier than two women who live alone before, you know, when they're just on their own as young, as young adults. And then what about Jenny doing the cleaning and Al not cleaning? She does all the work herself. Well, she gave that a two. That's lower even than Al doing the housework, right. She didn't like that alternative at all. And neither one of them cleaning, well that was a zero. That was bad, right. But if we look over at the table, the road tables, you know, just look across it, all cleaning. The total number of point she gave to that was 14 but when Al doesn't clean she gave that a two so she really has a lot to gain by convincing Al that he needs to do some cleaning, right. She goes from a two to a 14. That makes sense? Okay. But what about for her doing all the cleaning or not doing cleaning. Now the column totals, if Jenny does all the cleaning, that's a 12 but if Jenny doesn't do the cleaning that's a four. So she only gains eight points by changing her behavior. She goes from four to 12 but by changing Al's behavior, she gains 12 points. She goes from two to 14. So she really out to logically, just logically now, just being s-- Pollack, you know, on Star Trek, she ought to convince Al to clean, okay. That's her, that's her logical strategy. And what about Al's, ah, table. Well, he also rates it really high when both of them do the housework. He gives that an eight. And, but if our-- but if he cleans and Jenny doesn't, he gives that a two. That's pretty obnoxious for him. Whereas if Jenny cleans and Al doesn't, that's a seven. That's okay, you know, in Al's book if she does all the housework and this is sort of, you know, follows what men really think about housework, ah, in relationships. But what about if Al doesn't clean and Jenny doesn't clean. Nobody cleans the apartment. Well, that's not too bad. That's a two, you know. Jenny gave that a zero but for Al that's not as obnoxious as it is for Jenny. But now let's look at the column totals, right. Now, if Jenny cleans, that gives him 15 points whereas if she doesn't that gets him four points. So Je-- so Al gains 11 points from four to 15 by gi-- by convincing Jenny, his wife, to clean. Whereas what about changing his own behavior? Now the role totals, if Al goes from not cleaning to cleaning he only gains one point but he gains 11 points if he gets Jenny to clean. So logically, he should convince Jenny to clean so she should convince Al to clean and Al should convince Jenny to clean. That's game theory okay. So that's-- what that says is with self interest as the metric, Jenny will try to change Al and Al will try to change Jenny. So they'll argue tooth and nail about housework. But if we define trust as the metric in-- got your partner's back right, where Al is interested not only in his own self but also interested in Jenny's pay offs and Jenny is not interested just in what she gains but interested in her own pay offs. Look at the best arrangement here. It for, for them both to clean right. That's the highest tab-- rating in, in both their tables, is if they both clean. She gives that a 10 and he gives it an eight. So if the, if there's trust in the relationship, then we get to the highest pay off which is known as the Nash Equilibrium. Remember the movie A Beautiful Mind? John Nash won the Nobel prize. This is what he won the Nobel prize for okay. He won the Nobel prize by talking about how to get to the best outcome for both people and that what we're defining as trust.

GOTTMAN-LEVENSON PARADIGM • Over the last 38 years, produced measures that predict divorce or stability with over 90% accuracy, replicated in original study & 6 separate longitudinal replications (one as long as 20 years). • Predicted successful or unsuccessful transitions (to parenthood and retirement); • Generalized to gay and lesbian couples; • Produced a theory of relationship success; • Produced a therapy validated in 4 randomized clinical trials for: distressed couples, the transition to parenthood, successful parenting via the emotion coaching of children, and treatment of situational domestic violence. 

00:40:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Now, ah, Bob Levenson and I, ah, have done research for the last 38 years together. Ah, he was the best man in our wedding and he's my best friend and, and what we did in this research was we were able to predict either divorce or stability with over 90% accuracy and we did seven, ah, studies to do that. One as long as 20 years, following couples for as long as 20 years and we predicted also successful and unsuccessful life transitions like transition to parenthood, transition to retirement. This generalized the gay and lesbian couples relationships and we produced a theory or relationship success and, ah, Julie and I have now in the past 18 years, working together. Done four randomized clinical trials of that sound relationship house therapy. Ah, for distressed couples, for the transition of parenthood, for successful parenting, ah, through emotion coaching of children and the treatment of situational domestic violence which we'll talk about on Sunday and randomized clinical trail.

G→00: 52: 52.19.2 40 60 41 40 1005: 12 : 78 The Levenson-Gottman Video-Recall Rating dial Gives Us the Payoffs CAN ALSO VALIDLY CODE AFFECTIVE BEHAVIOR RATING DIAL GIVES VALID PAYOFFS ➢ Predicts changes in marital satisfaction over a 3-year period ➢ Coding rating dial predicts divorce or stability, with behavior 88% accuracy ➢ Levenson & Ruef: With use of rating dial, found a physiological substrate for empathy. CONCLUSION: RATING DIAL IS A GOOD UTILITY FUNCTION DEFINING "PAYOFF" BETWEEN COUPLES WE NOW CAN APPLY GAME THEORY TO ANY INTERACTION • Husband behavior as rows of table • Wife behavior as columns of table • Entries in table are average rating dial = Payoff numbers for each partner for that behavior exchange • And entries can also be how OFTEN this behavior exchange happened. THE ANSWER: Use Hidden Markov Model Analysis - Negative affect is an absorbing state for unhappy couples: the probability of entry (thick line) exceeds the probability of exit (thin line) NEGATIVITY NEUTRAL OR POSITIVITY 

00:41:40
JOHN GOTTMAN So, what do we do in this research? Well, you know, here's a picture of a couple. It's a split screen. They're actually facing one another and there-- cameras that emerge electronically and you can see the video time code. And they're either talking about how their day went or in an area of conflict or a positive topic or they're in the apartment lab moving around. Or after they, they have these interactions, they have this rating dial which they turn from very negative to very positive and they individually watch the videotapes of their interaction. That gives us the pay offs in game theory right. They're subjective, you know, perception of what the interaction was like. So here, we're getting an insider perspective. Now, we also need an outsider perspective so here we can actually, ah, code and validate their behavior and here we see, ah, a point where both of them are negative and now one of them is negative, I'm sorry. The, ah, to move back there, you see the blue like is a, is above zero and the red line is, is below zero. So, the husband is unhappy and the wife is happy and that's reflected in this picture of, ah, my niece and one our, our graduate students. Ah, so dad is very unhappy and his, ah, partner supposedly is smiling. Now, ah, later on we have a point where they're both negative. You can see that reflect in their faces. So we can validly code this behavior with this specific affect coding system. That really comes a lot from Paul Ekman, uhm, and Wallace Friesen's facial actions coding system and moving beyond that. The rating dial, just that one dial gives valid pay offs. You can predict whether couples will stay together and get divorced just from how they rated the interaction. That predicts over a three year period, uhm, and predicts with 88% accuracy whether a couple will get a divorce, just that rating dial. And in fact, if you have people not only rate it but also then try to guess how their partner rated it, then Bob Levenson and Anna Ruef discovered that people are accurate at guessing their partner's rating to the extent that they physiologically relive their partners experience and that's, ah, really in a substrate. The physiological substrate for empathy. So the rating dials leads to understanding empathy better. So, the conclusion is the rating dial is a good way of defining pay off. Okay, so now you can apply game theory to any interaction and in this interaction, you know, we can, we can look at the, ah, sorry, we can look at the husband and wife as rows and the table and columns of the table. Just like with Jenny and, and Al. And what we discovered was a very interesting thing from that and what I wanna suggest is that, uhm, there is only one way to screw up a relationship and that's, that's what we discovered here and this next diagram shows you what that is. And the answer is that in unhappy relationships, whether they're gay or lesbian committed relationships or heterosexual relationships, at any point in the life cycle, and this, I, I would predict is even true for parent-child relationships and friendships and work relationships is that when, ah, the relationship is ailing, it's easier to enter the state of negative emotion being reciprocated, okay. Which is over on that, that little oval on the left. It's easier to enter which is indicated by a very fat arrow from positivity and neutral in affect into negativity and its harder to exit so that's indicated by a very fat arrow going back into negativity.

THE ROACH MOTEL MODEL OF UNHAPPY MARRIAGE: "THEY CHECK IN BUT THEY DON'T CHECK OUT" • For unhappy couples, negative affect is like stepping into a quicksand bog. • Negative affect is called a "Markov absorbing state," but only for unhappy couples. • Repair does not work for them. REPAIR IS CENTRAL TO THE MASTERS OF RELATIONSHIPS (also Gianino & Tronick) • Happily married couples are able to exit this negative state because they HAVE A HIGH TRUST METRIC • THEY do effective repairs, like taking responsibility for even a part of the problem. HOW DO COUPLES BUILD A HIGH TRUST METRIC? THE MAJOR QUESTION IS: "Are you there for me?" • Trust is built in small moments via a social skill called, "attunement" • "attunement"= Fully "processing" a negative affect event • Discovered this in research on Emotion coaching for kids • Tested in USA, Australia, Korea. Builds trust with kids, creates secure attachment • Dan Yoshimoto's attunement interview for couples - extended Emotion Coaching to couples via the "meta-emotion" interview • Measures how much partners "there for one another," particularly during moments of negative affect. 

00:45:40
JOHN GOTTMAN And we call this The Roach Motel Model of Unhappy Marriage. In other words, they into negativity but they don't check out. And what's that about? Well, for unhappy couples, negative affect is like stepping into a quicksand bog. Ah, no matter how they wriggle, they sink in deeper and negative affect mathematically is called a Markov Absorbing State. Markov was a Russian mathematician in the 19th century and we used this Markov modeling to decode the genetic code in, ah, in DNA analysis and with genotype. Ah, ah, the, ah, genogram of a person is also used for deciphering ancient languages, uhm, as well. It's a way of finding hidden patterns in data. It's not very complicated right? The basic idea is that repair is central to the masters of relationships and Ed Tronick has even, ah, analyzed this in mother-infant reaction. It's not that mothers and babies are so beautifully synchronized. That's what Eddie discovered. Was, ah, I call him Eddie because we, we started in the same graduate class at the University of Wisconsin and we've been friends for almost 50 years and Ed, wound up working with Berry Brazelton. So it's not that moms are so sensiti-- to babies. It's that some moms n-- can tell when the baby's not getting it and the baby's going what and the mom's going what, you know. And the baby's fussing and, you know, and the mom's shall repair when the baby's three months old. Ed Tronick discovered have securely attached babies when the baby's one year old when you can measure secure attachment. So repair essential to relationships, everybody screws up in relationships. Communication is not par for the course, it's miscommunication that's par for the course and the masters of relationship can fix it. They can say, "I'm sorry. Ah, we talk about that. That really sucked, you know. Ah, I, I must have hurt your feelings. Okay." Happily married couples are able to exit this negative state because they have a high trust metric. Because they're not only thinking of their own welfare, they're thinking of their partner's welfare as well. It's not that they're just thinking of their partner's welfare but they really got their partner's back as well. So do effective repairs like taking responsibility saying, "You know, you're probably right. I was pretty grumpy yesterday and tell me more about, you know, what you're feeling. I wanna listen, I wanna hear it." And that's what is Johnson is doing in, in emotionally focused therapy. She's getting them to be able to hear one another's emotions and validate them. So, how do couples build this high trust metric? They answer that question, "Are you there for me?" with a skill that we call attunement and we're not the only ones to use that but we have a very specific meaning for it. We mean fully processing a shitty even okay. It's really, you know, dealing with the, the everyday poop of interaction right. Ah, processing a negative event means you can talk about it without getting back into it and we discover this in emotion coaching for kids first which by the way, have been tested even where we discovered it in Seattle and Southern Illinois. We've actually tested emotional coaching with children in Australia, Korea, you know, all over the planet kids are the same. Building trust with kids is about connecting with them particularly during emotional moment and it creates secure attachment. Now Dan Yoshimoto, my graduate student extended this to couple using an interview we call the meta-emotion interview. We interviewed people about how they feel about feelings in this interview. Okay, so we're measuring whether people can listen to one another when their partner is sad, when their partner is angry, when their partner is afraid when their partner is, ah, hurt. When their partner really, you know, feels like they're not there for them. Can they-- can you listen when she's mad at you? Can you listen when, you know, she's sad. 

00:50:15
THE BIG TRUST QUESTION The biggest issue in all marital conflicts just a few months after the wedding THE QUESTION OF TRUST OPENS UP LIKE A LARGE FAN WILL YOU BE THERE FOR ME? • When I'm sad? • When you have hut me? • When I'm angry with you? • When I'm hurt by your mother? • When I'm disappointed • When I'm horny • When I'm just upset? • When I'm lonely? • When I'm feeling trapped? • When I'm confused? IF ANSWER IS "YES" THEN THEY BUILD TRUST - FULLY PROCESSA NEGATIVE EVENT VIA "ATTUNEMENT" A = Awareness T = Turning Toward T = Tolerance U = Understanding N = Nondefensive Responding E = Empathy Attunement leads to: ✓ Fully being able to Process Negativity (e.g., Anger & Sadness) ✓ No Zeigarnik Effect ✓ No negative attributions of "selfishness"✓ No Markov absorbing state ✓ No negative Oral History Story of Us and Partner's Character WHEN ONE PARTNER TURNS AWAY FROM THE OTHER, (DISMISSING THAT PARTNER'S EMOTIONS), THEN WE GET THE ➢ ZEIGARNIK EFFECT: WE RECALL UNFINISHED EVENTS BETTER THAN FINISHED EVENTS (RATIO = 1.9, MORTON DEUTCH). • Rumination on unprocessed, unfinished negative affect events. ➢ "NOT FULLY PROCESSED" negative event = a "stone in one's shoe" ➢ "FULLY PROCESSED" = Can talk about all negative affect without getting back into it - UNDERSTANDING TRUST IS ALSO BUILT VIA ATTUNEMENT IN SIX "EMOTIONAL COMMAND" SYSTEMS Turned toward partner within each system (from Jaak Panksepp's Affective Neuroscience, modified): • 1. The Explorer (Seeking, anticipating, adventure, learning together) dopamine. In humans a consequence of this system is The Philosopher and Storyteller (Building shared meaning) • 2. The Sentry (Safety, reducing fear) Low Epinephrine • 3. The Nest Builder (Emotional closeness - giving & receiving care) Oxytocin, Vasopressin, Cortisol; Panic and Grief are its opposites • 4. The Jester (Humor, surprise, and play) dopamine, Serotonin • 5. The Commander-in-Chief (Power, dominance, anger, rage, fairness, equality) Epinephrine, Norepinephrine, Cortisol, low Serotonin. • 6. The Sensualists (Sensuality, orgasm) Testosterone. ATTACHMENT THEORY • It is a very successful theory. • But it only considers two of the six emotional command systems (The Sentry & The Nest Builder) • The theory assumes that if people feel safe and bonded, all the other systems will be fine. • Couples will be able to play, have adventures, have great sex and passion, and have no existential vacuum (Viktor Frank) • We think this assumption is not correct. • If we're right then the couples' therapist needs to be a master of ALL six emotional command systems, including The Jester, the Explorer (and the Philosopher), The Commander-in-Chief, and the Sensualist. • Our therapy has included all 6 emotional command systems. 

00:50:15
JOHN GOTTMAN So the big trust question, right, and this is the big shu-- big issue of all 130 marital conflicts in my lab. Just a couple of months after the wedding. It's like it opens up like a big fan and the questions is will you be there for me? Will you be there for me? Can I talk to you? Will you listen? Will you empathize when I'm sad? Will you listen to me when you've hurt me? Will you listen to me when I'm angry with you? Will you listen to me when I'm hurt by your mother? Will you listen to me when I'm disappointed? When I'm horny, will you listen to me? Will you be there for me when I want sex? When I'm upset, will you, will you keep being attracted to me? When I'm lonely, will you be there for me? When I'm feeling trapped in my life or in this relationship will you listen to me? When I'm confused, will you listen to me? And if the answer was yes, they built trust and that's phase two. They fully can process a negative event by attunement. So what's attunement? It's really-- attune stands for awareness, being aware of your partner's emotion is being able to read your partner's emotion and asking those questions Julie is talking about turning toward that emotion even if its anger with you. Having tolerance that there are always two points of you. Going for understanding. That what EFT is doing also, Emotionally Focused Therapy. Looking for emotional understanding and listening non-defensively and responding with empathy. That's what attune means right? It means those things, those six things are part of attunement. Well, attunement leads to fully being able to process negativity, anger and sadness for example. Ah, so there is no Zeigarnik effect and I'll explain that in a moment cuz it's very important. So there's no negative attributions of selfishness and no Markov absorbing state that stepping in quicksand in the Roach Hotel model. And no negative story of us and the partner's character. So what's this Zeigarnik effect? Well, when you turn away from your partner and dismiss your partner's emotion, you get the Zeigarnik effect. The Zeigarnik means that we recall unfinished events better than finished events. Two to one ratio. Bluma Zeigarnik discovered this in 1922 and it turns out to be pretty true, okay, so that, you know, we dream about things we haven't finished. That's what most dreams are about. We finished them in our dreams and we ruminate on unprocessed, unfinished negative events. Some people have suggested that this rumination is even the basis for a lot of obsessive compulsive neurosis, this ruminating on unfinished events in our past life. And, well, if you don't po-- finish processing something it becomes like a stone in your shoe that you keep walking on right? And it gets worse and worse overtime. Fully processing means you can talk about it without getting back into it and the goal is understanding. So that's the Zeigarnik effect. But trust is, it has to be built in seven different emotional command systems. So it's not just about the simple things. It's ab-- and Jaak Panksepp has pointed out that all mammals have in common seven different emotional command systems in his book Affective Neuroscience. And the first one we call the explorer. So a lot of this-- a lot of mammals are seeking, they're anticipating adventure, they're learning together. Dopamine is the major neurotransmitter of that system of exploring and the neurons are consequence of that exploration and we as a species are amazing explorers. We always wanna know what's over that hill. I mean, we, we go into outer space right, ah, risking our lives. That's what astronauts are doing. We wanna know what's out there. We wanna know, you know, what a comet like that came from the Oort cloud that just went past the sun? And what, what happens is we become storytellers. We become philosophers and we build a shared meaning system based on us being such strong explorers. Neanderthal wasn't as much of an explorer as homo sapiens and the second system is the sentry which is about safety and reducing fear. Epinephrine or adrenaline is a major, ah, neurotransmitter in our adrenaline, ah, for the-- for that system. The third system is the Nest Builder about emotional closeness and bonding. Oxytocin, vasopressin, cortisol, the panic and grief on separation at that system. Then we have another which we call the Jester which, ah, is about humor and play and surprise. Again, dopamine and serotonin-- part of that. And the fifth system which is about power, control, dominance, status, rage, anger, fairness and equality, ah, is another system that-- animals have and the sixth system is the Sensualist which is about lust and sex and testosterone is the major neurotransmitter of that system. Well, why did I mention these six emotional command systems? Well, really because attachment theory really looks at only two of them. It looks at the sentry which is about fear and safety and it looks at the nest builder which is about connection. But there are all these other systems and attachment theory, because it was done with mothers and babies, really assumes that once you feel safe with a partner, then your sex life great. So if you do therapy to the couple and you build attachment, then they will automatically have a great sex life, they will automatically be able to play. They'll automatically have worked out power and dominance in the relationship, who's in control and they will automatically be explorers and be able to have adventure together. Well, we think that's not true. That in fact, the couple's therapist and the family therapist needs to be a master of all emotional command systems and have tools for working with couples to help them build a more effective sex life to be able to play, to have adventure, to be able to laugh and those are separate systems. 

00:56:50
"BEING THERE" FOR PARTNER IN THE FACE OF NEGATIVE AFFECT. • Our hypothesis: Bonding is created by turning partner's negative (or positive) affect • Fully processing conflict or failures to connect in any of the six emotional command systems has even MORE POWER TO CREATE TRUST than turning toward in any of the command systems. BONDING IN THE CONTEXT OF NEGATIVE AFFECT IS POWERFUL. EXAMPLE ABOUND: • Yes, orgasms do build trust, but not like: - Exploring in the face of fear (climbing mountains, space exploration) - Turning toward a neighbor in the face of natural disasters (Joplin, Missouri tornado) - Battle buddies in war. Which is why coming home after deployment conflict seems so trivial, and connection to family seems so bland. - Orgasm pales in comparison to this kind of bonding. MAJOR RESEARCH FINDING ON TRUST: ATTUNEMENT IS BUILT PRIMARILY BY PROCESSING EVERYDAY FAILURES TO COMMUNICATE • Couples may argue about nothing. A regrettable incident just happens. • If it is fully processed, it is forgotten. • If it is not fully processed it becomes a stone in the shoe (Zeigarnik effect). • In our therapy. we use the Gottman Aftermath Kit (available on www.Gottman.Com) to fully process a regrettable incident that has happened in the past. • William Faulkner: "The past is never dead. In fact, it isn't even past." CAN WE CHANGE DISTRUST TO TRUST? THE QUESTION CAUSE-EFFECT EMPIRICAL QUESTION YES WE CAN. • Randomized clinical trial with 100 couples. (Babcock, Gottman Gottman, & Ryan, 2013 - J. of Family Therapy). • The Gottman's two-day "The Art & Science of Love" workshop significantly increases trust compared to a control group. • We get significant increases in the TRUST METRIC by increasing EMOTINAL ATTUNEMENT in couples. • But it's hard to get trust when relationships have a large power differential and they seem unfair, SO NEED TO BUILD A FAIRNESS METRIC. Time Series Behavior 60 40 20 0 -20 -40 -60 - H behavior - W behavior Perception 30 20 10 0 -10 -20 -30 - W perception - H perception Physiology 60 40 20 0 -20 -40 -60 - W physiology - H physiology 

00:56:50
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay, trust is built then by being there for one another. Repairing communication when it gets messed up. Okay, so especially being there for one's partner in the face of negative emotions. Okay. Now, we do build trust that secrete oxytocin in the face of, you know, positive emotions so being connected, having a great conversation, ha-- having an orgasm, we secrete oxytocin and build trust. But, what we suggest is that negative affect is even more powerful at building trust. Exploring at the face of fear, turning toward another in the face of the natural disaster as those amazing people of Joplin Missouri did after their mile wide tornado. Battle buddies in was which is why coming home after deployment conflict in families seems so trivial and connection in the family seems so bland compared to being battle buddies. Orgasm pales in connection to this kind of bonding. So the major research on trust just to summarize is to summarize is that attunement is built by primarily processing everyday failures to communicate. Okay, now can we change distrust to trust? That's an empirical question and it turns out. Yes we can. Ah, and we can do it in two days and we did a randomized clinical trial with a hundred couples and our art and science of love, workshop, or seminar significantly increases trust compared to a control group. So the trust metric changes and we increase emotional attunement in couples. Uhm, so we have come a long way. Not only do we understand how couples build trusts but we can significantly compare to a controlled group change trust, change the trust metric and change attunement. But we also need a fairness metric and here, I'm not gonna go into a lot of details on this but basically, uhm, this involves doing analysis of the basic data that we get from every interaction which is looking at not only behavior, emotional behavior but the rating dial perception and also physiology as well looking at all three of those together. 

00:59:20
The BETRAYAL METRIC DEFINING THE BETRAYAL METRIC • Betrayal takes many forms, e.g., affairs, addictions, deception, lying, broken promises. • But, betrayal begins in an any interaction that becomes a power struggle, meaning: • A "zero sum" game metric - A win-lose conflict - My gain is my partner's loss - Partner's gain is my loss • Betrayal metric = extent to which our rating dials negatively cross-correlated across partners. 10 8 6 4 2 0 0 50 200 150 Time (5 sec inv) THE BETRAYAL METRIC WORKS • OUR 20-YEAR LONGITUDINAL STUDY: Predicts early husband death. 58% versus 22% for cooperative metric, controlling for husband age and initial health. • Our second study showed that this dynamic of earlier husband death is likely to be related to chronic elevations in baseline blood velocity of husband and wife, Higher myocardial contractility. • Men get less protective blood pressure reduction effective from Oxytocin (the hormone of bonding). • Perhaps because men also secrete Vasopressin to ward off rivals after an orgasm (male rat studies). 

00:59:20
JOHN GOTTMAN And so we get a fairness metric and the basic finding here is that when relationships feel fair and they feel fair and they don't have to be balanced 50/50 to feel fair. When there's a balance of power, when particularly women are powerful in relationships and that's the critical dimension in, ah, both lesbian relationships and het-- and heterosexual relationships. When it feels fair and women have power, then there's a high fairness metric and it's easier to get trust in a relationship that feels fear. What about the betrayal metric? What, what's a metric for measuring betrayal? Our answer is that, ah, when relationships, ah, build betrayal, they're creating a zero sum game which means that conflict becomes a win-lose situation. My gain is my loss, her gain is my loss so betrayal metric measures the extent to which we have a win lose relationship when we have conflict and we measure that by the rating dial. So, here you see an example. The blue line is how the wife rated this actual conversation of conflict as went overtime and the red line is how the husband rated it, okay. So, his gain, ah, her gain is his loss in this relationship and that's a betrayal. So guess what they're talking about. What are they talking about? they're talking about his financial betrayal in this marriage okay. This couple is part of our 20 year longitudinal study and what we discovered, very interesting is over this 20 year longitudinal study if you've got that kind of rating dial pattern. Those husbands die at a very higher rate, 58% of those husbands keel over and die. Independent of their initial health and independent of, uhm, the, the relationship satisfaction and the reason they die in such a high rate is that they have greater blood velocity. Their hearts are pumping harder at every beat even during baseline. Now when they're, when they're not in conflict, they're chronically elevated in ha-- in myocardial contractility, how hard their heart is contracting. Okay, and it's not the women who die because it turns out that men get a lot less protective effect from oxytocin in terms of blood pressure reduction than women do and that's one of the sad things about being a guy. Just sucks. 

01:02:15
USING GAME THEORY WE CAN NOW COMPUTE VALID TRUST, FAIRNESS, & BETRAYAL METRICS ➢ Trust Metric = my partner behaves to maximize my payoffs. ➢ Fairness Metric = balance in power and emotional inertia. ➢ Betrayal Metric = win/lose zero-sum game for unhappily married couples. So loyalty= cooperative rather than zero-sum rating dials. Using Betrayal Metric we get our FINAL SURPRISING RESEARCH FINDING: THE GERM OF DISTRUST IS NOT THE SAME AS THE GERM OF BETRAYAL What begins the cascade toward betrayal? ANSWER: NEGATIVE COMPARISONS BETRAYAL HAPPENS WHILE TURNING AWAY FROM PARTNER'S BID WITH A "NEGATIVE COMP" • Out theory: the germ of betrayal is turning away from a bid, Plus NEGATIVE COMP • What is a NEGATIVE COMP? Judging behavior exchange by comparing it UNFAVORABLY with real or imagined alternatives • So the "GERM of betrayal" - while turning away from a partner's need, - NEGATIVE COMP is made: "I CAN DO BETTER" • Case of the man with a wife and mistress. Wife was "Too needy" mistress was always so "positive". Wife was with his baby, "very whiney" EXAMPLE OF COUPLE JOHM SAW IN THERAPY • John was their 6th therapist. • They came into the 5th session and said this was their last session • Asked them, "Help me understand why the therapy had failed." • We processed an argument they had. THEIR REGRETTABLE INCIDENT • He met a woman at a party. His wife was tired & wanted to leave. He told his wife he was more attracted to that OTHER woman than to her. • They had a fight. She thought "I'd be happier with a more mature man." • Both turned away from each other with a NEGATIVE COMP. • John understood why therapy didn't work for them. • Alice in Wonderland & Commitment • 2 months later, still together, working on "unconditional commitment" NEGATIVE COMPs BEGIN A CASCADE TOWARD BETRAYAL • NEGATIVE COMPs first measured successfully by the late & great Caryl Rusbult (first proposed by Thibaut & Kelley, 1959) • Rusbult'sw INVESTMENT & COMMITMENT MODEL, the only work table to PREDICT sexual infidelity in dating couples. Three decades of research. • All other studies start with infidelity and interview post hoc. • But people's retrospective accounts are highly flawed. • We present ourselves as innocent (Karl Heider; Travis & Aronson - Mistakes Were Made, But Not By Me) 

01:02:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay, so, so we validate the betrayal metric we can compute valid trust and fairness and betrayal metrics, okay. Remember the trust metric is my partner's behaving to maximize my pay off as well as her own. Her fairness metric is a balance of power and em-- and well, in emotional inertia or so. And the betrayal metric is really about the relationship being cooperative when there's conflict, not a zero sum game. So loyalty is about being cooperative. Okay, that's what loyalty is about. Now, the surprising thing is that the germ of distrust is not the same as the germ of betrayal. In other words, you can have a trusting relationship and have betrayal in that relationship and be nurturing betrayal. Now, we really need to understand this if we're gonna treat affairs right. Why do, why do affairs happen? Why do they happen? What begins the cascade toward betrayal? And the answer is negative comparisons. Okay, what do I mean by that? Betrayal happens when you turn away from your partner's bid for connection but you make a negative comparison as well. What's a negative comparison? It means that you think you can do better so not only does the-- do I turn away from Julie's sadness thinking who needs the-- who needs her sadness? I don't wanna deal with this. If I were with another woman, she'd be a lot more cheerful. Julie, Julie said a lot, you know. Who needs this crap, you know? I want a more cheerful person, you know. I want a more cheerful person, you know? I want-- and I can do better out there. In fact, this lady I've been having coffee with at Starbucks, she's really cheerful and she's really nice to be with and, you know, Julie's really sad. So I make this negative comparison, right. I can do better and, ah, and we actually saw a case where, ah, we just did the assessment. They didn't wanna do any therapy and this guy had a mistress in Vancouver and he had a wife in Seattle who had a young baby and he said, "You know, when I see my mistress, she's really nice to me but when I come home and talk to my wife she wants me to take care of the baby. She's tired on being with the baby and she's not a lot of fun to be with. But my mistress, she's a, she's a ball. She's fun, you know." We couldn't help this couple. All right, I-- here's another couple I saw in therapy. They were married so they didn't have an affair right? But the betrayal metric was operating and let me explain this to you. I was their sixth therapist right? I though, you know, "Hey. I'm a great therapist and I'm gonna be a-- I may be a Vulcan but, you know, I can help these guys." And so, they come into their fifth session and the husband says, "This is our last session." So I said, "Well, you know, we have a 24 hour cancellation policy so you've already paid for this session. You'll need to write me a check, ah, and, ah, I'd like you to write it now please." And our--would you do me the favor of staying for the session because I'd like to know-- would like to try to understand why I failed with you. So we processed and argument that they had and here was their regrettable incident that they hadn't processed, right, they hadn't repaired. So he met a woman at a party during the week. They both went to the party and his wife was tired and wanted to leave so he told, ah, his wife on the way home that he was more attracted to the other woman than to her. Found her really a lot sexier than you are, you know, I was really getting turned on and you wanted to go home. Ah, and so they had an argument. Ah, his wife didn't appreciate this-- some reason. Ah, it has to had the argument. I asked her what she was thinking and she said, I was thinking I'd be happier with a more mature man. So, ah, both had turned away from one another with a negative comparison, a negative comp, okay. And, ah, and now I understood why the therapy didn't work for them. I told them they could go now. Now-- and they wanted to stay, ah, and so I explained to them that, ah, they, they were married to one another, they had two children, they had a house together but they had never made a commitment right. That's what that other weight bearing wall in the sound relationship house is about: Commitment. And they said, " What do you mean? We've made a commitment." And I said, "No, you haven't really cuz of those negative comparisons. You haven't made a commitment." And to explain it I said, you know, this is kinda like, you know, the story Alice in Wonderland. Uhm, when the white rabbit jumps into the rabbit hole, Alice just goes right after the white rabbit see. That journey to wonderland is her journey. She doesn't sort of peer down the rabbit hole and say, "Ah, I might get my dress dirty. Uhm, maybe a better rabbit will come along tomorrow, uhm, you know." That was-- that rabbit was a little dirty, you know. Maybe a cleaner rabbit with come. No, she re-- she goes and wonderland, you know, is wonderful but it's also scary. I mean, the red queen is there but guys haven't made the decision that this is your journey, this is your life journey. You haven't entered the third phase of being in love which is the phase of making love to this person. The opposite of pornography as Victor Frankl said. Pornography is impersonal sex but love making, making love to this person is personal sex. And, you know, two months later they-- these guys were still together and were within-- with their seventh therapist working on commitment. Okay, now this, ah, idea of negative comps wasn't my idea. It comes from the 30 year research of a woman named Caryl Rusbult who unfortunately died at the age of 51 of breast cancer after she had met the one love of her life. And she met the love of her life when she was 40, okay. So she had some time with him but she did 30 years of research on this negative comparison idea and created an-- a model she called the investment and commitment model. She's a highly respected social psychologist. She's-- it's the only work that has ever been able to predict sexual infidelity. All the other research on infidelity starts with the affair but Carol could predict sexual infidelity.

CONCLUSION: THERE ARE ORDERLY, DETERMINISTIC, GLACIAL CASCADES TOWARD EITHER BETRAYAL OR LOYALTY Next slides will describe our hypothesized 24-step Cascade toward Betrayal THE24 STEP GOTTMAN- RUSBULT-GLASS (GRG) CASCADE TOWARD BETRAYAL 1. Turning away/dismissing, or turning against, few attunements 2. NEGATIVE COMPs accompany turning away/against. 3. Not "there for me" becomes the common event (turning toward 33% vs 86%) 4. Flooding/ physio arousal occurs whenever S#!T happens. Hypervigilance begins. 5. Conflict becomes a Markov absorbing state. Probability of entry to negative is greater than probability of exit. Repair does not work. 6. Couple avoids conflict. Suppresses negative affect. Has Blowups (Unprocessed S#!T). CASCADE TOWARDS BETRAYAL (CONT.) 7. Couple avoids Self-disclosure. Has secrets from partner, deception begins. 8. Bidding for attunement declines. Invests less in relationship. 10. Less dependency on relationship to get needs met. Confiding in others, not partner 11. Less Sacrificing for relationship. SUBSTITUTING (find what's not there elsewhere) 12. Maximizing partner's negative traits in one's mind, defensiveness begins. 13. Minimizing partner's positive traits. Criticism begins. Takes no responsibility for problems. 14. "Trashing" versus "cherishing." Contempt begins. Shared Meaning erodes. 15. Trashing partner to others. Contempt builds. deception builds, Story of Us gets neg. 16. Builds resentment vs. gratitude. Sees partner as SELFISH. Paradoxically, trusts PARTNER less. Stonewalling starts. 17. Loneliness in relationship build. Vulnerability to other relationships starts. 18. Partner refusing sex becomes punishing. Little sex, romance, fun, play, adventure, courtship. No sexuality love maps, no dream love maps. Low sexual desire. Porn use may increase. 19. Fewer pro-relationship cognitions. More anti- relationship cognitions. 20. No longer denigrating alternative relationships. Starts innocent new secret liasons. 21. Little fence between self & others. Reverses "walls & windows" (Shirley Glass) 22. Keeping more and more secrets from partner. deception increases. 23. Actively turning toward others for needs. Seeking what's not in relationship. 24. Crossing boundaries. Real betrayal unfolds. Deception becomes way to life. Risky.

JOHN GOTTMAN And, you know, that's really an amazing, amazing accomplishment and I was able to use her measures in my own research and I wanna suggest to you this hypothetical, ah, you know, we only have some evidence for this. A 24 step model of how couples build systematically build betrayal in a relationship. And I think this is very important because it really tells you how to reverse betrayal if you wanna work with a couple and build loyalty in this third stage of, uhm, love in a lifetime. And in this 24-step, ah, hypothetical cascade toward betrayal also includes the research of Shirley Glass who wrote one of the most important books on affairs called Not Just Friends. And if you haven't read that book, please go out and buy it. It's Shirley Glass. It's her name up there and she is the mother of Ira Glass, a na-- a national public radio who does this American life and, ah, she was an amazing woman and that book is the magnum opus. She was a therapist then. That book summarizes her work. So here's the f- step, turning away okay. Turning away, dismissing your partner's emotion. That's the first step in creating betrayal. Then, having a negative comparison along with the turning away. Who needs this crap? I can do better. Who needs her sadness? Who needs her anger? Who needs her bad moods, who needs this? You know, I can do better than this. I can, you know, yeah, I know somebody I can do better. Maybe I don't know anybody but there's somebody out there for me, I can do better. I'm sure, you know, or I could play World of Warcraft and find an avatar that's a lot nicer than me, you know. Ah, and the, and the third step is, you know, ah, not being there for one another. So one of the things that Julie didn't mention in her quick summary, ah, was that we found that newlyweds who, ah, had divorce six years after the wedding had turned toward their partner's bids 33% of the time and the ones who were still married had turned to her-- the partner's bids 86% of the time. So that's the third step I suggest not being there for one another. Okay, that starts eroding trust right. Then you get flooding physiological arousal occurring whenever shit happens in a relationship. In other words, whenever there's any kind of disagreement or irritability or emotional distance, you get a hyper vigilance and now people are saying, you know, "God!" And their heart rates go up and, you know, and they, and they become vigilant for this negativity in their partner's face like one client I had who said, "When my wife comes in to the room, I look at her face. If I see anything negative on her, I'm out of there. I don't wanna deal with that." Next, conflict becomes this absorbing state, this roach motel model, right. Everytime they, they try to discuss these things and they argue, you know, they just get deeper and deeper into it and the couple starts avoiding conflict. Okay, so I'm gonna make a bold statement here. Every single affair you'll ever treat, they're conflict avoiders. They have avoided conflict and Shirley Glass talked about this but they have n-- not, they have not processed the emotional wounds between them. EFT really focuses on processing these emotional wounds, okay. Then they have-- starts avoiding not only conflict but self-disclosure. They have secrets from their partner then. So they don't say, "You know, I had a wonderful conversation with a woman in the coffee house down the street and it was just so much fun and, and I realized driving home that we haven't talked like that in a long time and, god, I got really alarmed. Then I thought I needed to talk to you about that, you know. How can we really come back and have some of those wonderful conversations we all-- we had before. Before the baby came and we're not really paying attention to each other." So they don't say that. They say, "Oh, I don't wanna say that because its just gonna be a big fight" you know, cuz they have this absorbing state, the roach hotel model. So they don't talk about it and then have a secret. That's how secrets begin, by avoiding self disclosure. They stop bidding for attunement, they invest less in the relationship. This is Caryl Rusbult's ideas. There's less dependency on the relationship to get needs met. They start confiding in other people rather than the partner, right. This is what Caryl Rusbult really discovered. They sacrifice less for the relationship. So they sought-- start substituting for what's missing in the relationship and try to it in other ways. And, in doing so they maximize what is not there in the relationship and rather than cherishing what they have, they're maximizing their partner's negative qualities in their own lives. They get defensive, they minimize their partner's positive traits. They become critical. See, the four horsemen are emerging here. Defensiveness, criticism begins. They start trashing versus cherishing their partner. cherishing is the basis for building loyalty. They start expressing contempt. The third horseman begins. And then they start trashing their partner to other people. Contempt builds, deception builds, the story of us, the story of our relationship begins to get negative. They build resentment instead of nurturing gratitude. They see their partner as selfish and paradoxically they wind up trusting their partner less and they start stonewalling, withdrawing from the interaction and becoming lonely. And then they become vulnerable to other relationships and once they become vulnerable to other relationships the-- they find that they're not having sex as much. Ah, refusing sex when the partner says no, they get very upset and there's little sex and romance and fun and play and adventure. All of these different emotional command systems start being places where they're not turning toward one another. And there are fewer pro-relationship cognitions, more anti-relationship cognitions. They're no longer than the-- than denigrating alternative relationships which is what happens when you-- builds loyalty you really think you're relationship is pretty cool right, but when you're denigrating, your, your relationship against alternatives. Now you start innocent new secret liaisons. They may not be sexual but eventually there's a smaller fence between yourself and others. Surely Glass talked about this as reversing walls and windows. You keep more secrets from your partner, there's real deception and you actively turn toward others to get your needs met and secrets not there in the relationship and eventually you cross boundaries. You take risks.

MONOGAMY • Anthropologist: Monogamy invented about 20 - 40,000 years ago by Homo Sapiens; • A new reproductive strategy: Invest a lot in fewer offspring, longer period of dependency, cooperative hunter-gatherer (see Mothers and Other, by Hrdy); • There are three types of monogamy: Social, Reproductive, Sexual. Three kinds of monogamy: The evidence is we are overwhelmingly monogamous • United Nations World Fertility Report (2003): 89% of all people get married by the age of 49. Social monogamy overwhelmingly the norm in our species. (May be serial.) • In humans extra-pair paternity studies done in six cultures (USA, France, Switzerland, UK, Mexico, and the Yanomamo Indians), two review papers reviewing 28 studies found 96 to 98% genetic monogamy. (May be serial.) • USA rates in convenience samples vary from 15 to 43% of men and 10 to 15% of women being sexually unfaithful throughout their marriages. In one study of 50 pre-industrial cultures there was no significant difference between men and women in the amount of sexual infidelity. Majority of humans are sexually monogamous. THE VAST ADVANTAGES OF COMMITTED SOCIAL AND SEXUAL MONOGAMY • LIVE LONGER. = 10 YEARS (Friedman et al; Berkman & Syme Lois Verbrugge; Cacioppo's work on loneliness.) • STAY PHYSICALLY HEALTHIER (Many review papers. Burman & Margolin). • RECOVER FROM ILLNESS FASTER • BECOME WEALTHIER (Steve Nock)• CHILDREN DO MUCH BETTER (into their 50s)• BRAIN COMFORT DURING FEAR. Jim Coan's hand-holding studies with married people. Gays and lesbians get no shut down of fear system unless they consider themselves to be married. 

01:16:45
JOHN GOTTMAN Deception becomes a way of life, okay. Now what's the alternative? Monogamy, okay. Ah, anthropologist said that they, they claimed that monogamy really, ah, emerge about 20,000 to 40,000 years ago in our species. Those primates are not monogamous. This is a new reproductive strategy anthropologists say. Investing a lot in few offspring because there's a longer period of dependency because homo sapien babies have big heads and they need to be dependent for a longer time. And in, ah, Sarah Hrdy's book Mothers and Others, she talked about this need for attachment to more than one person. Orangutan mothers don't give up their babies for two and a half years. Homo sapien mothers and probably homo erectus, our ancestor, you know, handed the baby off to the father or to other males or to other women and we see this in hunting gathering societies as well. And there are three kinds of monogamy that anthropologist talk about. Social monogamy, hanging out with one person, reproductive monogamy, having children with one percent, sexual monogamy, having sex with one person. In these three kinds of monogamy, the evidence is overwhelming that we are primarily a monogamous species so that United Nations work for fertility report, ah, 89% of all people get married by the age of 49. Social monogamy is overwhelmingly the norm in our species even if its serial sometimes. We hang around just one, one partner and in humans, extra pair fertility study, study-- studies done in six different cultures including Yana-- Yanamo-- mamo, ah, Indians of USA, France and Switzerland. Ninety-six to 98% genetic monogamy. So again, may be serial. And, uhm, in convenient samples, ah, the majority of people are monogamous in relationships, you know. And, and infidelity in relationships has been estimated to range between two percent and 75%. So we really don't know, you know, how much infidelity really happens. Trying to say out that, ah, when you call somebody and ask them if they had an affair and they to hang up. So Shirley Glass handed out her questionnaires in airports and 90% of people she handed them to threw, threw 'em away. So her data is based on 10% sample. Well, there are vast advantages of committed and social and sexual monogamy. These are, these are undeniable facts. We life longer in a committed relationship more than te-- about 10 years longer. We stay physically healthier, we recover from illness faster, we become wealthier, our children do much better socially and intellectually, ah, we get more brain comfort during fear and Sue Johnson talk about her research with Jim Cohen and, you know, this is universally true and its, its truth only in committed relationships so gays and lesbians that consider themselves married even if their state doesn't permit them to marry, they get a, a reduction of fear in the amygdala during hand holding when they're in the scanner. 

01:20:10
Random Facts about Affairs • 70 percent of married women and 54 percent of married men say that they did not know of their spouses' extramarital activity. Adultery statistics state that 85% of women who feel their lover is cheating are correct. 50% of men who feel their lover is cheating are right. The first clue is seldom obvious. Typically, it's a "feeling" that something is different. • 90 percent of Americans say that they believe adultery is morally wrong. HOW OFTEN DO AFFAIRS HAPPEN? REPORTS VARY WIDELY - 22% of men and 14% of women say that they have had sex outside their marriages (Dec. 21, 1998 report in USA Today on a national study but the University of California, San Francisco). - According to surveys, 10% or extramarital affairs last one day, 10% last more than one day but less than a month, 50% last more than a month but less than a year, and 30% last two or more years. Few extramarital affairs last more than four years - Numbers from Playboy Magazine: 2 out of 3 women and 3 out of 4 men admit they have sexual thoughts about co-workers. 86% of men and 81% of women routinely flirt with the opposite sex. • Internet Pornography - Now A Royal Road to Infidelity HOW MANY AFFAIRS BECOME LASTING RELATIONSHIPS? • These who divorce rarely marry the person with whom they are having the affair. • Dr. Jan Halper's study of successful men (executives, entrepreneur, professionals) found that very few men who have affairs divorce their wives and marry their lovers. Only 3 percent of the 4,100 successful men surveyed eventually married their lovers. • The late Dr. Frank Pittman (an expert of treating affairs) found that the divorce rate among those who do marry their lovers is 75 percent. Major reason for the divorce? They don't trust their partner. ATONE-ATTUNE-ATTACH THERAPY: HEALING FROM AN AFFAIR (Now planned: Randomized clinical trial in collaboration with Dr. Paul Peluso) 

01:20:10
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. Ah, now here are some random facts about affairs. Ah, and, you know, ni-- the most important thing here is really that 90% of Americans say they believe adultery is morally wrong, ah, but how often do affairs happen? We don't know. We really don't know. Ah, and yet, you know, there-- we see a lot of high risk behavior. Internet pornography now is a royal road to infidelity. We even have websites that, you know, like Ashley Madison, they have 8 million users and Ashley Madison arranges affairs between married people. That's what the website is designed to do. How many affairs become lasting relationships? Three percent. Three percent of affairs become lasting relationships and the late Frank Pittman claim that 75% of them divorce. Why do you think they divorce? They don't trust their partner. Okay, now we're gonna turn to how do we treat this? And what do we do with this theory clinically? And here comes the heart of the collaboration, my wife Julie. 

01:21:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN And the heart has great sympathy for all of your bodies. And so, I would suggest we take a 10-minute break and after I-- after you come back, we'll be going into the nitty-gritty details of how do you treat an affair successfully. Ten minutes please.

01:31:20
[sil.] 

01:31:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Okay, so please return to your seats and we will get started. What I want to talk about now is therapy when you have a couple with betrayal with infidelity. How many of you actually see couples with infidelity? Yay, how many of you ask in an individual session in assessment in the beginning whether or not people have had an affair. Okay, very, very important thing to do. We estimate that probably 50% of the couples who are coming in the door probably have had affairs. Something like that in the clinical population. However, if you don't do assessments which we'll talk about in a minute, you'll never find out. So it's incredibly important to always do assessment before you begin the treatment and as part of the assessment you need to be asking each individual separately whether or not that person has had an affair. Now, let's just talk-- lets kind of set some ground rules okay. 

01:32:55
PRELIMINARIES • ASSESSMENT: Gottman Questionnaire package, Conjoint interview with couple's narrative, Oral History interview, conflict discussion, plus individual interviews. No individual secrets kept. • Make sure affair is really over, or don't do therapy. • Set up rules for interaction at home about the affair • May need individual sessions with betrayer about grief in losing affair partner. Express empathy. Using SRH diagram, outline the overall therapy to clients. Discuss building Marriage #2. PHASE 1: ATONE • THE ATONEMENT DIALOGUE (Peggy Vaughan's study - askpeggy.com; Shirley Glass's work) • Explain and explore the hurt partner's PTSD. • Hurt partner asks questions, betrayer practices transparent, non-defensive empathic listening. • Betrayer needs to express deep remorse. • do not examine WHY the affair happened in this phase. It risks blaming the victim. Encourage betrayer to avoid sex-related questions that create ruminations about sex details • Establish transparency, and verification. 

01:33:00
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN So when we do therapy in our methods one of the things we do is say in our disclosure statement that there will be no secrets. We do not keep secrets and I know that there are some therapist out there who really disagree with that. The reason that we have chosen that as our policy is because if you're keeping a secret of one individual, you are forming a collusion with that person against the other partner, right? So the therapy right off the bat is biased and when therapy is biased, and partners are not treated as equals, you cannot do therapy with a couple. So we do not keep secrets, we put that in our disclosure statement so that when have an individual session for assessment, couple already know that if they tell us yes, I have an affair, we will ask them to share that with their partner if they haven't already. So let's talk about little phenomenon. How many of you have had that situation before? Yeah, a few of you, okay. So, it's always very difficult. People are terrified that if they tell their partner about the affair, then, the relationship will be over. Their partner will be so hurt and betrayed that there will be no reconciliation and as a result, they want to keep it secret. What we tell people though is this: Most of the time partners have some sense that something is amiss, that maybe there might be an affair, that maybe that person is seeing somebody else. And they feel crazy when they have asked the partner, "Is something going on with Zelda at work?" And the husband says, "No." And their heads and their guts are saying, "Yes." Then they feel crazy, right. So if they have lied and said no, what we have is a double betrayal double betrayal. The first betrayal the affair itself, the second betrayal, lie the-- lying about it, keeping it secret and hiding it. So it's something that we always do in our assessment. We ask about the affair. If the person has told the other, I will often use the story to give then hope. We are holders of hope are we not? When couples first come in, they don't believe that there can be any healing of their relationship. Often times its a last-ditch effort. So I love to tell them the story, true story of a couple that we saw where the gentleman was a very, uhm, famous person who traveled a great deal. He had had 57 affairs and he had three children between the ages of maybe about two and eight. So 57 affairs that he had lied about over the process of 12 years. She knew, she knew every ounce of it but only intuitively and all of the many lies were compounding, the betrayal and making it so much more difficult. I tell a partner in front of me this couple worked it through and if people can work it through with 57 affairs maybe you can too with one. So you hold the hope, that's very crucial. People may need a few individual sessions. We call it ambivalence therapy. Actually Shirley Glass first named it that. Ambivalence therapy where one person doesn't know which relationship to be in. How many of you see couples where the affair is on going? May I please encourage you to not do that. Here's why. You know, I, I know they you're wanting to help so badly that you'll bend over backwards to try to help people but the reality is, you know, it's almost like, ah, treating somebody when they're intoxicated during every session, right. They don't know who they are, where they are, what relationship they're in. You can't do therapy when the person has one foot with that partner and one foot with the other partner. Which relationship are they in? What are you really working on. You're working on a nebulous cloud of ambivalence. So the alternative is to first see that person individually who is having an ongoing affair to help that person reconcile which partnership they wanna be in. That's crucial. Also, when you've got a coupe that has admitted an affair they both know there's been an affair, I like to set some ground rules also in possible they should only talk about the affair in the beginning in the office. In the office where both of them can be supported. That's crucial too. When they're home what happens is that its attack, defend, distance, more hurt, more destruction, blame, more contempt. And what do we know about those? They predict separation don't they? They predict divorce so what that means is that in the beginning at least, when the feelings are inflamed, you wanna be able to help those people to express their, their terrible anger, pain, and fear that it's still going on or may happen again. With support not only for the person who's expressing the feelings about the affair, the betrayed person but also the person who is hearing it and how painful it is for that person, okay. Now, we have three phases in our therapy. One of the huge breakthroughs of Shirley Glass, god bless her, is that she recognized that people who have been betrayed have every sign of PTSD. They are traumatized, right. If you think about it, they are having intrusive thought, thought that are pounding inside their heads that they end up ruminating on that they cannot shut out. Do they want those thoughts in their heads, no they do not. They don't have a choice. The thoughts come piercing in at every hour of the day and night. Secondly, people are hyper vigilant. They're constantly looking for other signs of an affair. They are looking in the glove compartments, the e-mails, the phones, other messages, work, timing. Do they come home for dinner. If they're home 10 minutes late, guess why. They are hyper vigilant, constantly looking for betrayal. They're having nightmares, they're having difficulty with sleep, they're having depression, they're having an alternation of numbing versus huge emotional explosions, right. What is that sound like? It's very clearly PTSD. When a betrayed partner is sitting in front of you, they feel crazy and it can be a relief to them to know that their response to this trauma is similar to that of somebody who has experienced an IED blowing up the vehicle riding and crashing it to the ground. Their marriage, their relationship has crashed to the ground, it has burned to ashes. That's what their experience has been. Unpredictable, terribly traumatic, they had no control over it right. That creates PTSD. So one of the first things that we do after assessment and incidentally during assessment, we're looking for those signs of PTSD. Is that in the session after assessment when we've done individual interviews, we've given them packets of questionnaires to look and evaluate every level of the sound relationship house that we explained. We have a packet that actually has been normalized. It's been normed, its been validated, uhm, and we use that along with measures of alcoholism, of domestic violence, of emotional abuse and so on. We do a very thorough assessment of a couple to see where is the strength, where is the challenges. We give them that feedback in a third session. First one is conjoined, second are two individuals, third conjoined. And there, we tell them you're betrayed partner has post traumatic stress disorder. Here's the signs of it. She or he is having terrible thoughts etcetera and they will recognize it. The wonderful thing is that when the betrayer is experiencing the results of all that PTSD, they believe all of the behaviors of the betrayed partner are intentional. Well, many of them are not. Many of them, that betrayed partner cannot stop. So it's important to give both people understanding and compassion that at this moment, PTSD is a third party in the relationship. Now, what we also tell people right in the beginning is here are the phases of treating an affair. In the first one, the betrayed partner needs to be able to ask questions of the betrayer about the affair. Any question they want with an exception. The exception is don't ask about the specifics of the sexual interaction with the affair partner because if you do it will generate new images of your partner having the affair that are very specific and very clear and will further traumatize you. But when something happened where it happened, how much was spent, when did it start. Those kinds of questions a person may ask and also they need to be able to express their emotions strongly but very important without the four horsemen. So people have to understand how do I express how enraged I am? How do I express how terrified I am? Without you goddamn bastard, right? How do they do that? How can they create the, the intensity with which they're feeling those emotions in their words and you may want to help them do that. I am so furious I could burn down a house. I feel so destroyed that my heart has been crumbled on the ground and stomped on. Help people with metaphors to express their rage, to express what they're feeling and then help the partner to hear it. You can say things to the partner like, It must be so terribly difficult to be hearing your partner's pain right now. I can only imagine how difficult this is for you." You have to express empathy for both people otherwise what happens is that you'll lose the betrayer. They will feel beaten up by you and the betrayed partner. So you have to empathize with how incredibly hard it is. Are you hanging in there? Can you handle a little bit more? I know this is really hard. What's it make you feel hearing this? You need to be asking questions like that. Question after question after question needs to be asked. Also, do not deal in the beginning with why did the affair happen because guess what you're doing. You're blaming both people. You're blaming the betrayed partner. it's sort of like saying if you hadn't been riding in that truck, you wouldn't have been hurt by the bomb that went off on the road. You shouldn't have been driving. Why were you driving? Does that make sense? No. You can't do that. The person who has been betrayed has got to have a chance to, to voice their emotion and to ask questions and hear their partner's shame and guilt and regret and remorse. But a partner will only be able to express that remorse if they also feel supported by you. So that's really crucial. 

01:50:30
LISTENING TO HURT PARTNER'S EMOTIONS • Expressions of negative emotions are okay, but not the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. • Help hurt partner to only discuss affair in session at first. Otherwise, likely to escalate. • In between sessions, hurt partner can do "feeling downloads" on therapist's voicemail or in journal. • Consider using Gottman-Rapoport blueprint as a new format for communication (with clipboards) JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN If you have people, a betrayed partner who is having terrible difficulty containing their feelings to the sessions and incidentally you might wanna group those sessions very close together in the beginning. You can ask them to do voice downloads on your voicemail. Have them call you on your voicemail which is confidential and they can say everything that they're feeling on that voicemail. You may not call them back, they may not need you to do that but to dump those feelings somewhere and feel like they're going to be listened to is very, very helpful for people. Okay, now, we have in our methods, you know, again we've created very different, uhm, tools for different problems. 

01:51:30
GOTTMAN-RAPOPORT BLUEPRINT - Replace Active Listening Take turns as speakers & listener: Rapoport: Postpone persuasion until each partner can summarize other to his to her satisfaction. SPEAKER bullet points: • 1. No blaming, no YOU statements • 2. I-STATEMENTS How you feel about a specific incident; • 3. POSITIVE NEED: What you want, prefer, and need. Behind every negative affect there is a longing, a wish, a hope, a recipe; • Avoid physiologically FLOODING the Listener. LISTENER bullet points: • 1. Take notes; • 2. Summarize partner's position and affect; • 3 Validate with empathy. Stay in WHAT'S THIS? Mode instead of WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? Mode. Rapoport Assumption of Similarity - change attributions. Now use Persuasion & Problem-solving. Compromise using the 2-oval method. 

01:51:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN One of them we call the Gottman-Rapoport blueprint. We use it for expressing needs. Also for expressing feelings and basically it's a little bit like active listening with one very important difference. The speakers role is also important. That was the problem with active listening that Bernard Guerney developed many, many years ago. There was no thought about how was the speaker expressing their emotion. So if a speaker says, "You know, I really hate and I think that you are ugly as sin and you disgust me." Okay, now the listener and active listening should say what? How many of you could do that? Oh, you're disgusted by me. I see. I don't think so, right. We're not just strong enough to do that unless-- I don't know, maybe we're the Dalai Lama or something but I'm, I'm nowhere near being a Dalai Lama so basically what we have to do is also control how things are spoken and the way we do that is "I feel about what?" And then "I need" "I feel about what?" And, "I need." This wraps into atonement in the following way. I feel, the betrayed person may say, out of my mind with rage and terrified, about what? That there will be another affair. What? There will be another affair. The "about what" is crucial. State the fact, state the fact. There will be another affair. Not, you're not gonna say I feel enraged about you being cruel, selfish, mean and betraying me again. Hear the difference? There's a difference. I need to know where you are every second of the day for the next 23 years. Okay, all right. So, you know, you've got very important points in this, ah, Gottman-Rapoport method that we can wrap into the treatment itself. One of the things also, I just wanna mention is that what I'll often say to people in terms of the affair and what are we doing in this therapy is marriage or committed relationship is gone. Relationship number one is gone. It has burned to the ground. What we will attempt to do here is build marriage number two. We're gonna build marriage number two. I had a couple who needed to rebuild their marriage seven times for various reason. So, that's, that's a way to give people a place to stand that helps ground them in what the heck are we doing here? 

01:55:25
EXPLORE ATONEMENT NEEDS • What kind of atonement does hurt partner need from betrayer partner? • Going forward, what kind of transparency does hurt partner need from betrayer partner? (Maybe checking cell phone VM and texting messages, e-mails, phone calls 24/7 if one partner is traveling, receipts, etc.) • Donald Baucom, Doug Snyder recommend hiring a detective in some cases. TOOLS FOR ATONE PHASE • Gottman-Rapoport Conflict Blueprint • Dealing With Flooding • Antidotes for the 4 Horsemen (Criticism, Contempt, defensiveness and Stonewalling) • Questions Regarding Affair (created by betrayed partner) 

01:55:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Okay, now, what kind of atonement does the hurt partner need? What does that hurt partner need? What can make a difference? Well, we know that the hurt is not gonna go away. It's not gonna just disappear but, but what kind of transparency would be helpful so that the hurt partner can begin to build trust. Trust of course is gone. We're building trust all over again and one of the things I like to say is we're building trust based on your partner's humanity and yours as well. What does that mean. Humanity means mistakes, means weakness, means things that we terribly regret. It means imperfection. Self betrayal as well. So transparency is the key. What does that hurt partner need in terms of transparency? One of the things that I will often suggest to people when affairs have occurred abroad is that, like in travel with one partner, is would you be willing to have cell phone on 24/7 and to pick up the phone any time night or day your partner calls you. Now, that's no guarantee of course that the partner is not lying next to some babe, right. But listen carefully to the breathing. So, right, there's many ways of detection. Right, private detectives are nice. John loves the idea of having private detectives follow the other partner cuz he loves reading mysteries, right, and detectives are cool. So let's send out a detective. That's another thing you can do. I, I'm not so much on that one but, uhm, okay. So what kind of transparency is needed? They can call, night or day, you'll pick up the phone, you'll tell them what's going on. Maybe you make it a video call, you know, whatever. Uhm, Skype is a wonderful thing, isn't it? Yeah, so also calling the partner, letting the partner know, you know, at home how you're doing, what's going on. Uhm, making your voicemails completely transparent, person can check them, person can check the texts, person can check all of the e-mail, person knows about any secret e-mail accounts. Those are now transparent. Everything has to be transparent. So what are you gonna get from a CEO about that one? A lot of resistance, right. So what do you do? You give them a choice kind of like a two-year-old. So the choice-- people who want power, right. So you give them a choice which is, "Okay, you don't have to be transparent, you don't have to show the voicemails but, you know, what we want you to know is that your partner's hyper vigilance and PTSD will continue indefinitely. It will never change because he won't have any avenue for building trust back again and knowing you are where you say you are. So it, it's you choice, it's up to you, right. That's, that's what you can do with people who resistant. Okay, so some of the tools then for the atonement phase are the conflict blueprints. Another one is dealing with flooding. So in flooding, what is really crucial is this. People physiologically will go into fighter flight, totally into fighter flight when they are usually terrible upset or they feel attacked and what happens is that they can no longer hear what's being said, they can't see what's on somebody's face. Everything that they perceive is about attack and its in that state, in physiological flooding that people will get violent, people will attack verbally or emotionally or physically. People will hurt walls, furniture, will scream at the top of their lungs. I once had a woman, this is-- watch out for this you therapists. I had a little teeny-weeny, Irish, five-foot tall, red headed, flaming woman whose very tall six-foot four husband had had multiple affairs. So she was so flooded and so angry and unfortunately I had just bought this beautiful red leather couch. There were scratch mark in it when she left so it really pays to help people with self soothing. That's the moral to the story I learned the hard way. So dealing with flooding, when you've got people flooding in front of you, don't get flooded yourself. Stay as calm as you can, use whatever method, whether it's your own deep breathing, weather its-- sometimes, what I'll do when I feel myself getting flooded as a couple is going ballistic with each other is I'll restyle their hairdos or their wardrobes and breathe of course and calm down. So stay calm is crucial people. And then what you can do is intervene. You take their heart rates. Make sure you take people's heart rates when they're going ballistic because if they're flooded, they have got to calm down first before they can continue any conversation. So calming down means doing deep breathing, you're teaching them how to do it so they can learn it themselves. Our therapy is dyadic, not triadic. We don't jump in and do the soothing. We try to help teach our partners how to soothe themselves. So we may do a guided visual relaxation and then give them a tape of it that they can practice at home. We may use, ah, an M wave, a little biofeedback device that's made by Hartmann that they can take home and use as a way of learning how to self soothe. There's lots of different methods that you can teach the partner so of course, your intervening at first and teaching but the partner learns how to do it themselves. That's crucial. Now, uhm, attunement. 

02:03:40
PHASE 2: ATTUNE • Explore why the affair happened using the Gottman-Glass Cascade model • Understand both partner's distress within marriage • Work on Conflict management • Learn how to recognize and turn towards bids during "sliding door" moments. May be one-sided, as betrayed person needs time to rebuild trust in order to turn towards partner • Process regrettable incidents using "Aftermath Of a Fight or Regrettable Incident Exercise, and dan Wile Intervention. PHASE 2: ATTUNE: (CONT.) • Discuss external stresses using the Stress-Reducing Conversation Exercise • Set up weekly 1-hour State of the Union meetings • Ritualize cherishing and gratitude, rather than trashing and resentment • Bring up problems by saying, "Here's what I do need," rather than, "Here's what I don't need." 

02:03:40
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN In Attunement, that's the phase that follows all the asking of questions the expressing of emotion and the hearing of emotion, the expression of regrets, of guilt, of sorrow. Reassurance that the partner wants to be there. All that's taking place in that first phase and it may take a long time. I had with one guy, we'll talk about later, 10 months for that phase of attunemnent. You know why? Because she came in with three yellow pads of questions and every single one of 'em was gonna get answered. So it took a really long time. Okay, so let's talk about attunement. So in attunement, remember what John said this morning about conflict management most couples who have affairs have conflict avoidance as a problem. They have no idea of how to deal with conflict. So one of the things that we do is we work on conflict management and I can't go through all of the different tools that we use, all the different step in conflict management here, uhm, but it's incredibly important to give people alternatives about how to state their position on an issue, how to listen to their partner's position, how to take it deeper by asking their partner questions that helps them understand the underlying dream, core need, childhood history, or set of values that underlies beneath that surface, really where they're living in terms of their position on an issue. Once you do that, then the edges soften. Once there's understanding of those deeper levels for a partner of why a position on an issue was so important to them. Then they can begin to move towards problem solving and compromise but not before that. That's crucial. The other thing that we do is we process regrettable incidents from the past and here I'm not talking about, uhm, you had an affair so let's process it. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about a fight that went badly or a failed bid for connection. A given moment in time that went south. How do you profess that so that you can move beyond it and we'll talk about that in a moment. Some of the other things that we do during this attunement phase is not only do we work on conflict. Processing past bad fights that went south as well as how to move towards resolution or at least understanding of current issues. We also work on building friendship. So we do things like we create rituals of connection for partners. Rituals like, how do you say goodbye in the morning before you go to work in a way that feels loving and warm for both of you. How do you reunite at the end of the day and catch up with each other when you have incredibly busy lives and 17 children. How do you do that in such a way that you're really creating more connection. Do you go on dates every week? Do you go on weekend? How do you celebrate birthdays. How do you deal with a partner being sick in a way that feels best for them. You explore all the different needs people have for connection. So not only do they need safe attached connection, they also need ways that they can count on for that connection and we are a spiritual species. We love rituals. Rituals are important to us. So creating rituals for connection is a beautiful way of not only rebuilding marriage number two but bringing out the expressions of fondness and admiration of love and learning who our partner is by, in the process of creating those rituals, figuring out what is most meaningful for our partners and meaningful for ourselves and sharing that with each other. See the love mapping that's going on there. What would it mean to you if I greeted you with a door only wrapped in saran wrap. Well, let me think about it. So, you know, so you really wanna understand where your partner lives, right. And what kinds of connection they really want. Uhm, also what people bring problems or needs. It's very important that they bring up what they do need rather than what they don't need. That's a common mistake that lots of couples make which is, you know, I need you to, uhm, stop being such a nag. I need you to stop being such a slob. I need you to stop being such a slob. I need you to quit driving so fast so carelessly. Every single one of those to the partner to the is gonna feel like what. A put down. Its gonna feel like criticism, it's gonna feel like a blaming. However, instead, if you say I would really love your help in cleaning up the living room. I would really love it if we could drive nice and slow and relaxed so that we can have a great conversation while we're driving. Wow, very different right? Has a very different feeling to it. So it's, its helping people learn how to express their needs in a way that they don't sabotage their getting listened to. 

02:10:45
TOOLS FOR ATTUNE PHASE • Expressing Needs Exercise • Stress-Reducing Conversation • State Of The Union Meeting • Turn Toward Bids • Aftermath of a Fight or Regrettable Incident Intervention • Dan Wile Intervention Aftermath of a Fight or Regrettable Incident The Gottman Institute This form is for "processing" past fights, regrettable incident or past emotional injuries. "Processing" means that you can talk about the incident without getting back into it again. It needs to be a conversation - Page 1 Work through the following five steps together. The Five Steps 1.

02:10:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN So here's some of the actual, ah, tools that we use. And let me show you this one. Uhm, you probably can't see it very well but it's a little booklet and it's called the Aftermath of a regrettable incident. So, this little, uhm, this little booklet. It's about yay big. We built it small so it fit in a pocket. People use it. They follow it step by step to process a regrettable incident that happened in the past and get over it again. You can't do that with just a quick apology. It's not gonna work. There are some steps that we learned from out marvelous couples on how to do that. So basically these booklets, step one is a whole list of feelings. What did each partner feel during the regrettable incident. They read whatever feelings they had off this list. Both of them and they may have as many as all of them. They don't explain why, they just say what the feelings were so we're slowing everything down. This is dyadic, right, not triadic. They can take this home and do it themselves. Step two, subjective realities. There's always two points of view in every regrettable incident and they're both right. So they described. Each one takes a turn describing the facts of what they perceive during event which may be totally black and white different from the partners subjective reality but none the less is true and valuable so they describe the facts of what they heard, what they saw, what happened and then they tie it into what those things made them feel. The listening partner will summarize that and try to say something validating like I get it, I see now, I understand, that's what you heard, wow, okay. They have to say okay. That's not what I said! Don't let him go there. Always two points of view then they trade places. The other person tells their reality, the first person listens, summarizes, validates. Triggers are about feelings that may have come up during the regrettable incident that are ancient feelings that started probably in childhood or a former relationship, not in this relationship. If any feelings like abandonment, exclusion, rejection, attack, etcetera were triggered in the regrettable incident they say what those feelings were and say what earliest experiences created those. Taking responsibility, we move into it very gently. What set me up is yet another list having to do with very gently. What set me up is yet another list having to do with what was your general state of mind during this incident? Well, I was really stressed out, I needed to be alone. They're reading off different states of mind they may have had then they say what they regret specifically. What do they regret having said or done during the incident. Three, the apologize and four, hopefully their partner accepts the apology. The last step is making a constructive plan. What's one thing you can do differently next time and what's one thing I can do differently next time to make it better. 

02:14:55
CASE EXAMPLE: DAVID AND DIANE TRANSCRIPT OF AFTERMATH OF A FIGHT OR REGRETTABLE INCIDENT DAVID AND DIANE • David wealthy businessman • Diane stay at home Mom • Married 27 years • Three kids, two older and out of home one special needs, home-schooled.

(transcript) 

02:15:00
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Now, what we'd like to do is to read a transcript of an aftermath of a fight incident in a couple where there's an affair. So let me tell you about this couple. They were from Texas. They lived in a gigantic, huge house. I can only imagine how big. David was a very wealthy businessman. Diane was to stay at home and raise their children. They had three kids. Two were older by this time, one was still home in high school was a special need child that they mother had chosen to home school. David's family history was that he-- really awful abusive family, alcoholic, emotionally abusive. His mom had been very passive and he really determined to get out of poverty and succeeds, succeed, succeed. That was his drive. Diane had come from a middle class family, pretty healthy, it sounded like. Four siblings, three sisters she had. She was the weird one who decided to become a Buddhist at age 10. I thought that was pretty cool. She's probably the only Buddhist in Texas. Okay, so the couple's history was that they had married after college. They'd had kids in quick succession, ah, Diane had home schooled one of the children and David had worked very hard to advance. David complained to his friends to his friends about not getting enough attention at home. What's wrong with that sentence? Who was he complaining to? Right. Who he should have been complaining to? Yes, exactly! They introduced him, his friends introduced him to potential affair partners. Great friends right. So he slept around with a variety of women that his friends introduced him to and then he had a special affair with Olivia. When his wife confronted him, he denied everything and then he mother's day with Olivia instead of his wife. This is the problem. One of the older kids, saw e-mail exchanges on the computer between David and Olivia and what with it with people with affairs where they leave their email up on a family computer in the living room. What is that? Right, I mean it's really a yes, they do wanna get bought, that's right. So, okay. So Diane confronted David and he confessed. Okay, so now John and I are gonna read a transcript and let me just, uhm, tell you the circumstances. This, after this took place after they done all of the questions and answers for the most part. They were now doing some remorse and this was one of the incidents that had really just lacerated Diane. The incident was that she noticed when David was at home that he wasn't wearing his wedding ring. So we pulled out that lovely aftermath of her regrettable incident, little kit. And I need my glasses. Where are they? And we started working on this incident. So, I'll explain to you stuff that I'm doing. I'll be Diane, John's David and I'll also be me doing the therapy. Okay, so Diane, all right. I'm re... 

02:19:05
JOHN GOTTMAN Shall I get the transcript up? 

02:19:05
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Yeah, that would be great. 

02:19:10
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. 

02:19:10
GOTTMAN TRUST AND BETRAYAL INTERVENTIONS USING THE GOTTMAN RECOVERY KIT. This transcript will illustrate some of how Julie dramatizes the feelings of each patient using the Dan Wile method so that strong emotions are elicited and articulated and so that empathy is made possible Diane: Feelings got hurt, totally flooded, angry, sad, unloved, like you didn't even like me, not care about, afraid, unsafe, out of control, unappreciated, disliked, unattractive, stupid, taken for granted, I was overwhelmed with emotion, powerless, I had no influence, my opinions didn't even matter, lonely, alienated, ashamed, I'll add that I felt morally outraged, the daughter, the kids, goes against my beliefs David: Confusion I had the voices starting to talk to me. Diane: Go from removing the ring all the way to Paris. David: This is really in the height of abandonment before waking up, really waking up. Diane: Yes, what were you feelings? David: Disoriented, confused, lost, you didn't hear me, feelings were hurt, flooded, withdrawal, alienation, angry, criticized, misunderstood, fear, out of control, unappreciated, disliked, not calm, anything but calm, clearly stubborn, I knew I was stubborn, had no influence, especially on "intimacy," lonely, alienated, no idea what I was feeling a lot of the time, just shut out, alienated, switched off absolutely ashamed. Julie: okay, okay Diane: This is very helpful. Hard to find words usually. Here I can see all that words here and it's clear. David: Disoriented, and lost. Oh my God I wanted to get out of this, but was trapped in my own bullshit, caught in the web Julie: Your reality? Diane: Which part? John: All of it. Julie: All of it. Diane: What I was feeling from when I said no sex without intimacy until months later was a growing sense of our separation, our division. I felt that you were uncomfortable in a parent role, but our children are gone now. He will come home. I thought, I will wait. We will become old people together. I will give David some space and we're start building this 3rd part of our lives together. We hadn't talked about what did you want, but you rejected whatever I offered up. I'd say what we're doing is that we're being a family. I thought you'd hear that at some point and you'd ask me. I sat and I waited. It became overwhelming. I had to play this song over and over just to get up and go to sleep alone. Then I got active suddenly, planning the Mardi Gras with the kids, snowboarding in Colorado, and I thought, "David will come and see that there is so much fun here as a family. Then I noticed that the ring was off. And our daughter called you out on it and then you put it on again and then you took it off again. And you were going to go back and see HER again, I just knew it, and then I thought, "we're done." He's not coming back, so I listed the house for sale. We passed each other on the road quite literally and I knew we were done. I rented that apartment. That brings me to the end. Julie: Can I help? Diane: Sure. Julie: I still had some shreds of hope. There was innocence to my hope as I sat in the garden of our home. I wanted to believe that a fairy Godmother would deliver you to the garden and you'd see me sweetly sitting there and the scales would fall from your eyes and you'd see our family and our own children and here we were together facing our sunset years. A part of me felt peaceful and a part heard the ticking of time go by and every second told me that I was alone, I was done, there was no hope, I had to fall. Maybe I was truly not seen by you, loved, treasured, cherished. I clung to the belief that maybe I was wrong. So I'd go into that cavernous house and to that big empty place inside me. Take an empty pail and drop a drop from a great height and it makes a big sound of emptiness and that is what I felt. I tried to be strong, I gritted my teeth. Then when I saw that you had taken off your wedding ring, I was stunned at first. A moment of trauma. When all I see is that hand with no ring on it. I couldn't believe it. A spark when our daughter called you out of her rage and it quickly disappeared into darkness. My heart was broken. I walked around with a big crack in my heart. Mother's day really blew my mind. Of all the things I deserved to be celebrated for was the mother I was, the giving, strong, struggling mother. I deserve to be celebrated to the sky. Diane: You just didn't like me. Julie: When you told me you were going away that was a slap across the face by you but also by me for hoping. I realized then that I was done. The bleakness and desolation and despair I felt so bleak, very still, quiet, very alone. Then I started to step on the path towards singlehood. I knew I could do it, I was strong, but I was wounded. Keeping my chin up was an act of God. I prepared to put the house on the market and say good bye to my life. David: (crying) I know. 

02:19:10
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN John will get up the transcript so you could read it too. Here it is. 

02:19:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. 

02:19:20
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Maybe hard to read but we'll go for it. 

02:19:20
JOHN GOTTMAN I can make it bigger. 

02:19:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Honey. 

02:19:25
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. 

02:19:30
[sil.] 

02:19:35
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Man, technology. Man and technology. He's a Vulcan. 

02:19:40
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. 

02:19:40
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Okay, all right. Okay, so we're now reading-- she's reading off the list of feelings. She's saying, okay, so this is just reading right off the list. Okay, my feelings got hurt. I was totally flooded, angry, sad, unloved like you didn't even like me. Not cared about, afraid, unsafe, out of control, unappreciated, disliked, unattractive, stupid, taken for granted. I was overwhelmed with emotion, powerless, I had no influence, my opinions didn't even matter. Lonely, alienated, ashamed, I'll add that I felt morally outraged, the daughter, the kids seeing this. It goes against my beliefs 

02:20:45
JOHN GOTTMAN Confusion I had the voices starting to talk to me. 

02:20:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Okay, so go from removing the ring all the way to Paris. 

02:20:55
JOHN GOTTMAN This is really in the height of abandonment before waking up, really waking up. 

02:21:00
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Yes, okay. So what were you feelings? 

02:21:05
JOHN GOTTMAN Disoriented, confused, lost, you didn't hear me. My feelings were hurt, flooded, withdrawal, alienation, angry, criticized, misunderstood, fear, out of control, unappreciated just like not calm, anything but calm. Clearly stubborn. I knew I was stubborn, I had no influence especially on intimacy. Lonely, alienated, no idea what I was feeling a lot of the time, just shut out, alienated, switched off absolutely ashamed. 

02:21:45
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Julie, "Okay, okay." Diane. 

02:21:50
JOHN GOTTMAN I said, you know, if I... 

02:21:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN This is very helpful. 

02:21:50
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah. 

02:21:55
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Hard to find the words usually. Here, I can see all the word here and its clear. 

02:22:00
JOHN GOTTMAN Disoriented and lost. Oh, my god. I wanted to get out this - 

02:22:00
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Slow down, slow down. 

02:22:00
JOHN GOTTMAN - but I was trapped in my own bullshit, caught in the web. 

02:22:10
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Okay, Julie, "Your reality now, your subjective reality?" Diane, "Which part? All of it Julie." Diane, "What I was feeling from when I said no sex without intimacy until months later was a growing sense of our separation or division. I felt that you were uncomfortable in a parent role but our children are gone now. He will come home. I thought I will wait. We will become old people together. I will give David some space and we're start building this third part of our lives together. We hadn't talked about what did you want but you rejected whatever I offered up. I'd say what we're doing is that we're being a family. I thought you'd heard that at some point and you'd ask me. I sat and I waited. It became overwhelming. I had to play this song over and over just to get up and then go to sleep alone. Then I got active suddenly, planning the Mardi Gras with the kids, snowboarding in Colorado and I thought, David will come and see that there's so much fun here as a family. Then I noticed that the ring was off and our daughter called you out on it and then you put it on again and then you took it off again. And you were gonna go back and see her again? I just knew it. And then I thought, we're done. He's not coming back. So I listed the house for sale. We passed each other on the road quite literally and I knew we were done. I rented that apartment and that brings me to the end." Julie, "Can I help?" Diane, "Sure." Now, what I'm gonna be doing now, people, this isn't aside, is I'm gonna be doing what I call a Dan Wile intervention. Dan Wile, W-I-L-E is a brilliant psychologist in Oakland California who devised a method of speaking for one partner as if he was that partner. Only when he's spoke, he would give it added depth from things he knew, things he perceived, things he felt the other person probably was also feeling but not express it. This is what I'm gonna do now when I say, "Diane, can I help? I'll be speaking her voice. Here's what I say. I still had some shreds of hope. There was innocence to my hope as I sat in the garden of our home. I wanted to believe that a fairy godmother would deliver you to the garden and you'd see me sweetly sitting there and the scales would fall from your eyes and you'd see our family and our own children and here we were together, facing our sunset years. A part of me felt peaceful and a part heard the ticking of time go by and every second told me that I was alone, I was done. There was no hope, I had to fall. Maybe I was truly not seen by you, loved, treasured, cherished. I clung to the belief that maybe I was wrong. So I'd go into that cavernous house and to that big empty place inside me. Take an empty pail and drop a drop of liquid form a great height and it makes a big sound of emptiness and half that is what I felt. I tried to be strong, I gritted my teeth. Then when I saw that you had taken off your wedding ring I was stunned at first. A moment of trauma when all I see is that hand with no ring on it. I couldn't believe it. A spark when our daughter called you out of her rage and it quickly disappeared into darkness. My heart was broken. I walked around with a big crack in my heart. Mother's day really blew my mind. Of all the things I deserve to be celebrated for was the mother I was. The giving, strong, struggling mother. I deserve to be celebrated to this guy. Now Diane says, "You just didn't like me. Then I stepped in again with a Dan Wile. When you told me you were going away, that was a slap across the face by you but also by me for hoping. I realized then that I was done. The bleakness and desolation and despair I felt so bleak, very still, quiet, very alone. Then I started to step on the path towards singlehood. I knew I could do it, I was strong but I was wounded. Keeping my chin up was an act of god. I prepared to put the house on the market and say good by to my life." 

02:28:20
JOHN GOTTMAN I know. 

02:28:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN David Says I know. He's crying at this point. 

02:28:25
JOHN GOTTMAN Vulcans don't cry. 

02:28:30
[sil.] 

02:28:30
Diane: We would have ended it like we lived it with no resolution. David: I got that. Diane: Should I go? John: Your reality, up to the end in Paris. Diane: What was your reality? David: So hard to talk about yourself in hones terms when you know how cowardly you have been. I'm off in la-la land I deserve better she is pulling back. I am feeling really sorry for myself. Julie: You felt hurt. 

02:28:45
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Diane says, "We would have ended it like we lived it with no resolution." 

02:28:50
JOHN GOTTMAN I got that. 

02:28:55
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Diane, "Should I go?" Your reality, up to the end in Paris. Diane says, "Okay David, what was your reality. 

02:29:10
JOHN GOTTMAN So hard to talk about yourself in honest terms when you know how cowardly you've been. I'm off in la-la land and I deserve better, she is pulling back. I am feeling totally sorry for myself. 

02:29:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN I step in and I say, "You really felt hurt." 

02:29:30
JOHN GOTTMAN I didn't look at alternatives, what is happening to her I was totally self-absorbed. 

02:29:35
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Diane asked, "What was your reality when we'd had hex and I stared up at you and said 'I can't do this anymore'? You are looking at me in the mirror, in the armoire when you wouldn't look at me face to face and I said I can't do this anymore. Please be honest." 

02:30:00
JOHN GOTTMAN Well, selfish, abandoned, completely confused. I tried to include you in intimacy but it never worked for you. 

02:30:10
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Diane, "Your act," okay listen that criticism, right. "So I say shh." 

02:30:25
JOHN GOTTMAN I misinterpreted what you said as permission for me to go outside the marriage. Did this other entitled act. 

02:30:35
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Julie, "David, this isn't about you saying what you think she wants to hear." 

02:30:40
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. 

02:30:45
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN David, can I try and here I'm gonna do a little bit of a Dan Wile. When you said, I can't do this anymore, I felt a flash of panic. What the hell is she talking about? You ripped off my mask. I felt like a failure, less than a man slammed to the floor." 

02:31:05
JOHN GOTTMAN Julie got it right. 

02:31:10
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN And then Julie says, "And then I felt furious." 

02:31:10
JOHN GOTTMAN You're good. 

02:31:15
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN I didn't plant that, I... 

02:31:20
JOHN GOTTMAN But I set this trap. Now he's weeping pretty hard. And empty hole to cheat you and your menopause. So cheap, so cowardly, so deserting. It's the worst. I was blaming you, however, I conspired with those jackasses. I allowed myself to cheat on you. I completely abandoned you. Please forgive me. 

02:31:45
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Diane says, "You were grateful I released you." 

02:31:55
JOHN GOTTMAN And he puts his head on her lap at this point. He says, "Why we're in trouble." 

02:32:00
David: You're good. But I set this trap (weeping hard) an empty hole to cheat you in your menopause, so cheap, so cowardly, so deserting. It's the worst. I was blaming you, however, I conspired with those jackasses. I allowed myself to cheat on you. I completely abandoned you. Please forgive me. Diane: You were grateful I released you. David: (puts his head on her lap) This is why we're in trouble. Julie: What did you feel at that moment? David: I don't know. Julie: play it back in your head. David: I remember I have no idea what she's talking about. Julie: What's the feeling? John: Freedom. 

02:32:00
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN I say, "What did you feel at that moment?" 

02:32:10
JOHN GOTTMAN I don't know. 

02:32:10
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Julie, "I sit with him a little bit. Play it back in your head." 

02:32:20
JOHN GOTTMAN I remember I have no idea what she's talking about. 

02:32:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN I ask him, "What's the feeling?" 

02:32:30
JOHN GOTTMAN And I say something. Ther-- I ther-- as a therapist I say, "Freedom" and David says, "Fear, frustration. She's right, its permission to cheat. I, I knew I'd lose her. I've been a failure in this marriage as you come to ahead and I needed some relief. She couldn't solve my problem and it was a sense of freedom. I didn't want that freedom. I'm not good enough for her. That arrogant, self-absorbed taker that I was." 

02:33:00
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Diane says, "I wasn't good enough for him." 

02:33:00
JOHN GOTTMAN I didn't say who you were. I thought I was better than you. When I say arrogance, I'm better than you and I blamed you for feeling. I had, I had the money. I was better than you. I, I had, I had earned all that money. 

02:33:20
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN I say, "David, you know, you're right about arrogance being a defense. 

02:33:25
JOHN GOTTMAN Small man's pistol doesn't shoot very good. John's word Freedom. I am taking you down to these men, that incompetent, small, fearful. 

02:33:40
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN I say, "Inferior." 

02:33:40
JOHN GOTTMAN Not freedom to fuck her, freedom to get away from my failure. I would, I would not honor the fact that you're a better parent, superior spiritually. I've, I've dodged decisions all my life. 

02:33:55
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Diane says, "David, can I ask was there relief cuz you'd already cheated?" 

02:34:05
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, your permission was there now. I was angry at you but I, I turned the speed up on my life to a frenetic pace, highly. I can't really recall it. I get, I get no emotions when I think of it. I was not in love with her and she was turning the heat up, making us more public. I didn't feel the weight of what I was doing but I saw the edges of the end game. I was ashamed, I was ashamed. I felt lost. I, I wanted you to fix this. I come back. So sorry, I'm more broken than you ever knew. 

02:34:40
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN I turned to Diane and I just asked, "How are you feeling Diane?" Diane says, "I don't know how to put it into words. When did your reality come crashing down?" 

02:34:55
JOHN GOTTMAN And when an unstable mask starts falling apart, it's not a crash, its chunks breaking off and falling apart. Then I took that bike ride, going down that mountain. I saw the truck in the road, the lucky truck and it was going way too fast, arrogant, and I knew as time slowed down that I was gonna crash and I did. It was a miracle I didn't die. And I don't think I was trying to kill myself but I don't really know. I thought, aren't you supposed to be enjoying life? And now, it's gonna come to this hollow end. I had that moment and said, "Okay, you can take me lord." Something in me knew I was toast. I could see these guys on the bench. I could see their mustaches. I crushed my rib cage and I got a tremendous pain and I thought, "I have gotta fix my life, it is so broken." 

02:35:55
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Then what happened? 

02:35:55
JOHN GOTTMAN I went to see her in Paris. Then I saw the way she treated her son and I couldn't help it. I started to puke and I was thinking, Diane would never treat our son that way. So I puked all over her. 

02:36:20
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Yes. 

02:36:20
JOHN GOTTMAN I turned around, packed up and flew straight home to see you. That was the turning point. I, I've been a coward, conflict avoider. I thought, "What am I doing with this person I don't love and don't respect? I was reminded of my own ineptitude as a parent but I could tell that she was very wrong. I spit up that hairball." 

02:36:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN I asked him, Julie asked him, "Are you scared?" 

02:36:55
JOHN GOTTMAN To death. She will tell me to take a hike. When I go home you would ask me if I was having an affair and I said, "Diane" 

02:37:05
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Ah, where is it? 

02:37:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Ah, wait. 

02:37:15
Julie: Were you scared? David: To death. She will tell me to take me to take a hike. When I got home you home you asked me if I was having an affair and I said... Diane: You said, "I slipped." David: I couldn't handle it. I went upstairs for 10 minute. Overwhelming. I have affected more than 50 people in my family by this, Mr. Selfish. Diane: I said I'm not gonna be able to live with this. David: I'm still blaming her at this point. I said, "Remember when you told me to get a mistress, well that's what I did." 

02:37:15
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN You said - 

02:37:15
JOHN GOTTMAN I slipped. 

02:37:15
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN - ""I slipped." 

02:37:20
JOHN GOTTMAN Right, I couldn't hand it. I went upstairs for 10 minutes. Overwhelming. I, I have affected more than 50 people in my family by this, Mr. Selfish. 

02:37:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Diane, "I said I'm not gonna be able to live with this." 

02:37:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, I'm still blaming her at this point. I said, "Remember when you told me to get a mistress, well that's what I did." 

02:37:45
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Diane says, "Yeah, black hole." Julie, "I say to him, you lost your dream." Diane, "I wasted a quarter of a century. He tore it up and he threw it away." 

02:38:00
JOHN GOTTMAN Things you can never reconstruct the hi-- that history. I, I destroyed the history we had build together. 

02:38:05
JOHN GOTTMAN Hmm. 

02:38:10
JOHN GOTTMAN And, and I said then, "You can't go!" Something clicked inside of me and I said, "You're not leaving this woman." 

02:38:15
Couple's history (cont.) • David denied all affairs. • David spent Mother's day with Olivia rather than Diane. • Eventually one of older kids saw e-mail exchanges between David and Olivia, and alerted Diane. • Diane confronted David and he confessed. (transcript) PHASE 3: ATTACH • Use Love Maps and Open-Ended Question Card decks to rebuild knowledge of one another. • Encourage expression of fondness, admiration, and appreciation. May be one-sided at first due to betrayed partner's fear of getting close again. • Set up formal high cost for subsequent betrayals. • Use Rituals Of Connection Intervention to create ways of connecting that both partners can count on. • Build pro-relationship language and thoughts and build towards renewed commitment. • Turn towards by sacrifice, mutual investment, and effective interdependence. PHASE 3: ATTACH (CONT.) • Learn the skills of intimate conversation using GottSex Kit. • Create personal sex and intimate trust using GottSex Kit, with betrayed partner in charge of timing. • Re-build new shared meaning system. • Meta-norms: Include some significant others in knowledge of repairing this relationship. MATERIALS FOR ATTACH PHASE • Rituals of Connection Exercise • Open-ended Questions Exercise • Fondness and Admiration Checklist • Appreciation Checklist 

02:38:15
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Okay, so we're gonna stop at there. There was more that went on. Uhm, was totally cool and lets go back to just finishing now phase three. So we were working through the circumstances that created the affair and now, as we got through that, slowly but surely. So we've done atonement, attunement. Now we move into attachment. So with attachment, remember that when there's been an affair, the hurt partner has no idea of who the other partner is anymore. And of course, the other partner has distance to herself or himself from that hurt partner so they don't know who the other partner is either. So love maps, open ended questions, we have little cool, little card decks that have these deep, open ended questions for couples to actually ask each other deep, deep, deep questions like, you know, what characteristics of your own would you like our son to inherit? Things like that so that they can get to know each other all over again. We work on expressions of the fondness and admiration and of course keep in mind that the hurt partner may not be able to express fondness and admiration for quite some time because if they allow themselves to really feel the love and the respect and the admiration for their partner, they make themselves vulnerable to hurt again. So what you may see is moving forward and then moving backwards, moving forward and then backwards into, you know, well, yeah, yes I love you and thank you very much for washing my car. Now, I'm gonna go have dinner with the kids by myself. You know, that's the kind of stuff that you may see for a little while. Uhm, so there's lots of vulnerability. Here's where you begin to create rituals of connection, new rituals of connection and ways of turning towards each other by some sacrifice especially by the betrayer, mutual investment, effective interdependence. You know that word co-dependent doesn't really apply to relationships. It may apply to addiction but that's another story. So interdependence is what we are looking for over here. Ways that people can turn towards each other now with building of trust, more trust. That question of will you be there for me? Well, I'll see. And testing it over and over and over again to see whether I can actually allow myself vulnerability, allow myself to be dependent on you a little bit at a time. We also work on intimacy. John and I created this very cool program called GottSex. Isn't that cute? Oh, I didn't think of it. And what we have there are, you know, it's not about, you know, get this toy out or that toy. It's more about how do you talk about sex because if you've ever seen couples talk about sex in front of you you have no idea of what they're talking about. How was it last night? Oh, it was okay and you get time. Well, did you really? Well, yeah, it was okay. What you mean by okay? Well, you know, I mean it was, it was good enough. Good enough? Well, I mean, I was trying to do more than that. Well, like I said, it was good enough, you know, so what are they talking about? You know, he cleaned the house. I mean, what was it, what is he talking about. So we have people, you know, go through these seven different exercises that really helped them to talk about sex, about creating ways of initiating sex that are safe for both people, ways of refusing sex that don't demolish the person whose initiated but are kind and gentle and feel okay, talking about sexual preferences, you know, and all kinds of things. So that's a, a very cool little way of rebuilding their sexual relationship and that may take some time. Uhm, and so for the attachment phase its-- we use the rituals of connection exercise. We have a card deck yet again John loves card decks, you know. It's cool, they're fun. So, people go through all these different suggestions for ways they might connect with one another and then they pick one and then they build a whole ritual around it that really feels great for both of them, detail of it. Open ended questions. We have a fondness in admiration checklist so, you know, ways that couples have tools that they can take home because our goal ultimately is to make ourselves obsolete. That's the goal. So, uhm, I think I'm gonna stop here and, uhm, this is basically our model then there's lots more detail about it and, uhm, we wanna leave you 15 minutes for questions. There's a mic up here and a mic there and a mic over there. So if any of you have any questions, please come up to the mic. 

02:45:00
JOHN GOTTMAN Wait, disassemble this. 

02:45:00
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Okay, thank you. 

02:45:10
[sil.] 

02:45:15
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Question? 

02:45:15
UNKNOWN What do you do with long term ambivalence. I've heard ambivalence, stable ambiguity describe. So what if one of the partners is ambivalent? 

02:45:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN What if one partner cannot resolve their ambivalence? 

02:45:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:45:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Okay. Uhm, you might wanna do individual therapy with that person for a really long time but what you would also wanna do is really encourage then person to tell their partner about the affair so that they look themselves in the mirror and not feel so profoundly guilty with every additional day that they're lying or not telling their partner. And also give the partner some freedom of choice. So that's what I would wanna work on. Uhm, yes. Over here. 

02:46:10
UNKNOWN Yes, hi, uhm, I have a question. What if both partners betrayed each other so first, there was a betrayer and the hurt and then the hurt partner became also the betrayer. 

02:46:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Okay, so what if both partners have had affairs and done some betrayal. 

02:46:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm 

02:46:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Well, double the fun. 

02:46:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:46:35
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Double the fun. So you've got double PTSD. 

02:46:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

02:46:40
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN You've got double of everything so, you know, the thing that's gonna be hardest for you as a therapist is you've got two siblings both of whom wanna be the victim - 

02:46:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:46:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN - and who are you gonna side with - 

02:46:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:46:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN - right. So - 

02:46:55
UNKNOWN And the flooding. 

02:46:55
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN - you'll have to move back and forth and back and forth with them as gracefully as you can - 

02:47:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:47:05
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN With every step. 

02:47:05
UNKNOWN Can I call you? No I'm just kidding. 

02:47:10
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Yes you can. Question? 

02:47:10
UNKNOWN No, yes. What do you do in the event that the betrayer is not yet ready to admit to their infidelity and, uhm, refuses to do so at the time. 

02:47:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN As I said earlier then, uhm, the question-- could you all hear it? 

02:47:25
UNKNOWN No, I can't. 

02:47:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I haven't been repeating the questions. The question was what if the betrayer, uhm, will not admit the affair? So what you need to do then is, uhm, it's gonna be a up to you. First of all, how long has it been since the affair occurred, if, you know, people have different standards, if it was more than 10 years ago. Maybe, maybe you might let it go or maybe not. I had one where 20 years earlier there had been an affair and it really needed to be processed so they processed it. Uhm, you may wanna do, you know, say to the partner that couple therapy is premature and do some individual work or refer that person for individual work as they work through their terror of admitting the truth as well as what it mean to them inside to be living a double life, to be living a lie and how that makes them feel about themselves because they're gonna be suffering in most cases if they have a conscience with every day they're hiding the truth. So did they wanna prolong their suffering? That's, that's the avenue I wanna take. 

02:48:55
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

02:48:55
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Mm-hmm. 

02:48:55
UNKNOWN Uhm, I just wanted to thank you for today, uhm, as very insightful, uhm, presentation for me and, uhm, I just wanted to ask in reference to your talking about negative story building outside of the couple relationship. Uhm, and was wondering if they're-- where is the line between the negative story building and being able to, uhm, maybe problem solve outside of the relationship with friends or having some sort of record keep or so on. 

02:49:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN I'm sorry. I was having a hard time hearing it. 

02:49:30
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, yeah. So, ah, so, you know, when you go outside the relationship - 

02:49:35
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Uh-huh. 

02:49:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Uhm, is it, is it always betrayal? And, you know, I would say that if you're, you know, you can certainly-- it's certainly okay to go to friends and ask for, you know, their advice and so on. But if you don't bring it, eventually bring it, eventually bring it back to your partner, right, and say, "Look, you know, ah, I've been very upset about something going up between us. I've even talked to some of my friends about, you know, what to do but, you know, here's, here's the problem I'm having and I-- you know, you're the person ultimately that I need to bring this to, work this out and I'm really scared to bring it to you. You know, and then that's part of why I talk to my friends about it. So can we find some time to talk about this cuz, you know, it's really important to me, you know. 

02:50:20
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN So it's important that it doesn't remain a secret outside of the couple relationship just between the friendship and... 

02:50:30
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, I think it's a perfectly normal thing to do but if you're, if you're really going to your partner, to your friends to trash your partner and you don't bring it up. That's one of the big-- that's where you're sliding down this cascade toward betrayal. 

02:50:40
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Right - 

02:50:45
UNKNOWN Thank you 

02:50:45
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Great. 

02:50:45
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah. I think that's the dividing line. 

02:50:45
UNKNOWN How do you handle, ah, open relationships where there's been a betrayal of the contracts so to speak that they've had, uhm, when I've had couples, ah, I've usually requested that whether in therapy that they close the relationship at the time being. 

02:51:00
UNKNOWN They've managed it. 

02:51:00
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Uhm, now let's see. So your question was how do you handle a betrayal in an open relationship. 

02:51:05
UNKNOWN Right, and open relationship. 

02:51:05
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Where, uhm... 

02:51:10
JOHN GOTTMAN They have sex with other partners. That's okay because its part of the open relationship. 

02:51:15
UNKNOWN But then they broken their rules, ah, of, you know, what they've established is okay and that... 

02:51:20
JOHN GOTTMAN And it's really very similar, right. 

02:51:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN So they've broken their rules. 

02:51:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:51:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN For example, let's say they've gotten emotionally connected - 

02:51:30
UNKNOWN Exactly, right. 

02:51:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN - to another partner. 

02:51:30
UNKNOWN Right, but they didn't disclose or something like that they agree upon, right. 

02:51:35
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Right, right. So, uhm, you treated, ah, the same way that you treat, ah, an affair. You treated the same way. The thing that eventually needs to be said though is that, uhm, when you play with fire you get burnt in most cases. You know, not all always. There are some people who really, ah, you know, don't necessarily take the little oxytocin burst upon orgasm and apply it to the relationship of the person that they're having the orgasm with but most of us will in fact do that. So it's, you know, its, its, uhm, a horrible mistake that was perhaps based on, ah, first of all not being able to talk with one another as deeply as they need to about problems or conflicts or, you know, their own interpersonal need and then, not really having the knowledge of how slippery that trail is that they were walking down. That's, that's where I would go with it. 

02:52:50
JOHN GOTTMAN And, and, ah, one of our therapists, ah, who, you know, does a lot of work in San Francisco with, ah, these polyamorous couples have said that, ah, she's always found it really productive to, to explore, ah, problems in their own attachment as well, you know. That maybe commitment is a really difficult thing to just one relationship for a lot of these people because they haven't really ever had a secure attachment. Yeah. 

02:53:15
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN That's right. 

02:53:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, sure. 

02:53:20
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN That's right. Uhm, right over there. 

02:53:20
UNKNOWN Uhm, during phase one when you were talking about, ah, the betrayed being able to, ah, ask all the questions about the affair. You said that, ah, probably not asking about specific sexual information. And I wanted to know how their imagination is any worse than what actually happened. 

02:53:45
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN It's actually, uhm, their imagination is usually on hyperdrive. You're right about that however, uhm, the reality is that when they hear they actual specifics, you know, they have much less shielding from their own fantasies. So they may hear about, for example, something that they would never do. Let's say they, they don't like cunnilingus so they didn't happen of cunnilingus, right, with the part-- with the affair partner. Then they hear that the husband really loved cunnilingus and that's what he was doing with the affair partner. Well, what do you think that's gonna do to her? You see, so, you know, people are gonna fantasize any way but it's much worse sometimes to get the graphic details. 

02:54:45
UNKNOWN Right, thank you. 

02:54:45
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN That's what we see. 

02:54:50
UNKNOWN Hi. Yeah, so a lot of couples to counseling and complain about pornography, ah, but what about masturbation? Ah, because I'm guessing when most people are doing that, they are not really thinking about-- about their partner. 

02:55:10
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Okay. 

02:55:10
UNKNOWN As it has strong collia-- ah, correlation between, ah, affairs and having masturbation in a committed relationship. 

02:55:20
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Okay. 

02:55:20
JOHN GOTTMAN So, ah, you know, research, ah, that was done in, ah, Lowman's study, the sex in America study showed that, uhm, couples who have a satisfying sex life-- committed couples who have a satisfying sex life masturbate more than single people do. And so, masturbation, you know, is just something, something people do so, ah, is it a betrayal. Wha-- you know, really depends on what the-- what the partner things about it. And so we've encountered a, you know, wide range of reactions to the partner masturbating and, you know, and, and sometimes people do feel it's a betrayal and, you know, the only thing that we can say is that, ah, tolerance and masturbation usually leads to a happier sex life. That's what we found over and over again. Uhm, and, you know, some people find it really difficult and particularly very, very religious people are extremely conservative to think masturbation itself is a sin but intercourse is not a sin. So you get these individual differences and attitudes and, you know, partly as a therapist, you could do some education about it and, you know, and talk about, you know. These are-- there are certain secrets that people keep from each other, you know, and, you know, we don't share everything, you know. You know, you don't always say, "Well honey, let me tell you about bowel movement I just had, you know. Is that keeping a secret? Well, not necessarily, you know. 

02:56:55
UNKNOWN Who's... 

02:56:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Might be kind of... 

02:56:55
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Masturbation, bowel movements. What are the... 

02:56:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Kind of okay to keep our-- to keep those kinds. Well, to me a bowel movement is more satisfying than a... 

02:57:05
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN We're getting in trouble now. Uh-oh. 

02:57:10
JOHN GOTTMAN We're just talking about secrets. Ah, you know, not everything needs to be shared. Okay. 

02:57:15
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Thank you, dear. 

02:57:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Thank you. 

02:57:20
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Next. 

02:57:20
UNKNOWN I was wondering about, ah, those people who get obsessive about needing to hear all the details and cannot let go, ah, move to forgiveness and, uhm, how long is long enough and when do we f-- ah, what, what do we do in those situations? 

02:57:40
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN I love that question. So the question was, what somebody is obsessively holding on to all the questions, uhm, and you can't move them into forgiveness what do you do, what do you do? How long can that go on? You know, first of all, I am a firm believer that people do not have to forgive. That sometimes forgiveness, ah, is possible and sometimes it isn't and it's not necessarily a prerequisite to rebuilding a relationship after an affair. Sometimes. Sometimes, understanding is important, acceptance, but forgiveness is just out of reach. What I have seen is that, uhm, it's not up to us to determine how long it's gonna take for somebody before their questions have been answered and they've heard I'm sorry enough times, times 10 to sixth in order to finally say, "Okay, I can let it go." But what you can do though, you know, with your, uhm, ah, concern about that and how long can the hurt partner or the betrayed partner put up with this is, uhm, have faith in the process. Have faith in it. I've specialized in working with affairs and I have never treated an affair couple even if they go as long as 10 months of asking questions every single week where eventually, the pain didn't diminish with enough knowledge and enough remorse. Not go away, mind you, but diminish to the point where they could move forward. People develop. That's how we're built. Our cells die, divide and are born again and its true in terms of every part of our living including recovering from emotional injuries. So if you're patient, they'll find their time. 

03:00:15
UNKNOWN Ah, at times it feels like they're getting stuck in the punishment and, and wanting this person to do penance and just cannot stop. 

03:00:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN They may get stuck in the punishment you're saying. Damn right. They're angry - 

03:00:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:00:35
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN - they're upset, they're furious. If you see it as punishing, then guess who you're blaming. So the point is they are trying to express their rage and their pain. Maybe there have been some vindictiveness in it. Okay, but that vindictiveness usually comes out through contempt and criticism. If you stop that part and keep it focused on feelings, there's no more punishment. 

03:01:10
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

03:01:10
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Mm-hmm. 

03:01:15
UNKNOWN Hi, good afternoon. 

03:01:15
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Last question everyone. This will be the last one. I'm sorry its four o'clock, yeah. 

03:01:20
UNKNOWN My questions is, you know, what-- addiction to pornography is, is becoming something that's almost out of control. Uhm, is there what the other person when once the person is exposed, that they've been, you know, involved in pornography. The person who feels betrayed, are we gonna treat this couple the same way as you described today. 

03:01:40
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Uhm, I'm not sure I heard that whole question. 

03:01:45
JOHN GOTTMAN Would-- would you, would you treat addiction to pornography like in affair the same way. 

03:01:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Would you-- right. Would you treat addiction to pornography like an affair, uhm, depends if it was secretive. Usually it is, uhm, so there are elements of betrayal in it, ah, but what we also need to understand is-- and we're just beginning to understand all of this is that addiction is a disease and sexual addiction is also a disease. And so its important to understand when somebody has moved into pornography and they're compulsively using it, ah, as an addict and it takes control over their lives. They're still gonna be a tremendous sense of betrayal which has to be dealt with but they're also needs to be work on the person, the addict on all the levels of addiction that accompany dealing with pornography, right. So things like the biochemical changes that can occur with repeated pornographic use. The way that personal sets become impersonal sex and what that's like the way that the addiction may be helping that person to numb themselves for feeling something else and exploring what that's about, what it's like to feel out of control, you know. I mean there's-- I-- we could go on and on about that. 

03:03:20
JOHN GOTTMAN So, so-- and the other thing is the compulsive-- the compulsive nature of the addiction, you know, which we now know involved the dopaminergic system and the caudate on so, you know, all of that can be looked into so individual therapy and psychopharmacology may need to accompany the treatment of pornography addiction as it does with gambling addiction or any obsessive compulsive disorder like that. 

03:03:45
UNKNOWN So you, you would, ah, you would suggest individual therapy for the person first before we end the... 

03:03:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Not first. At the same time, at the same time. 

03:03:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Along, along with it. 

03:03:55
UNKNOWN At the same time. 

03:03:55
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN At the same time. 

03:03:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Cuz there may be an even detox. 

03:03:55
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN We have to stop sweetie. Thank you so much - 

03:04:00
UNKNOWN Thank you all, yeah. 

03:04:00
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN - everyone, thank you. Thank you.
