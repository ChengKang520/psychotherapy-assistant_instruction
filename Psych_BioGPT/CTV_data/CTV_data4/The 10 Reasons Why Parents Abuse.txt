OLIVER W. TUTHILL JR Is there anything more meaningful, more value, more precious than the love a parent has for their child. A child needs the love, guidance, respect and compassion of the parent to grow into a capable adult. Sadly, all too often this does not occur. Our juvenile detention centers, our hospitals, our Jails and institutions are filled with those unfortunates who have been abused by their parents. Lost, confused, lacking the social skills essential for survival in a modern world, they live out lives of quiet desperation. But why do parents abuse? What would drive someone to maltreat their own child? This program will explore the ten reasons why parents abuse children.

AUTUMN TREE PRODUCTIONS PRESENTS AN OLIVER W. TUTHILL JR FILM THE TEN REASONS WHY PARENTS ABUSE 

00:01:35
MJ I was terrified for… for my dad coming home. And on his days off it was even worse. Umm… If something went wrong and something is revealed or if my dad woke up on the wrong side of the bed, he’d find that something I did was wrong, something I did… The way I looked at him, I didn’t look at him right, we’d be eating breakfast and my mom would fry eggs that were extra runny and I couldn’t stand runny eggs and I’d be slow to eat 'em, because they made me choke. And my dad would catch on that I was having trouble with the eggs and he would sit there and force me to not only put 'em in my mouth but hold 'em in my mouth until I was sitting there practically gagging and throwing up on my plate. If I was lucky I got the meal down without being sick. And that would set off the whole day. He'd decide that the mud room for example was dirty and needed to be scrubbed, he’d remove every object out of the mud room and put me in the mud room with a bucket of water and… and a brush and tell me to scrub. And 15 hours later I’d still be scrubbing the mud room. 

00:02:45
1.Lack of Parenting Skills 

00:02:45
OLIVER W. TUTHILL JR , M.A. Executive Director Autumn Tree Productions Many parents find themselves abusing their children, because they don’t know how to be a parent. They have no idea how to be a parent. They… They have never learned how to be a parent. They have never educated themselves on how to parent the child. Their parent in many cases didn't know how to parent. And because the fact that so many of our educational institutions and organizations don’t really offer courses on how to be an effective parent, most of us, when we have a kid, I mean, it's not the child comes over a manual on how to be a parent, we don’t know how to be a parent. And so many parents today have children and they lack parenting skills. And when they lack parenting skills, when they don’t understand how to parent, when they don’t understand childhood development, they are much more likely to abuse. 

00:03:35
MJ Clearly both parents lacked parenting skills. My mom, for example, was never parented herself. She is taking care of her own sisters as a mother drawing on whatever intuition and guesses she can make as how to do it, carries that into her own marriage and to her own children, taking care of her children and the only way she can figure out how, I don’t know whatever she learned, may be she learned it from TV or she learned it in the things that she saw around her, but clearly my mom was not… did not have those skills and did not learn neither did my dad. 

00:04:15
RICHARD N. BRANDON , Ph.D. Human Services Policy Center University of Washington The essence of good parenting skills is understanding the principles of child development and how to apply those principles in children’s daily lives, whether it’s at home or at school. When you get resistance is when you start labeling things as we’re going to teach you how to be a good parent, you don’t know how to be a mother, you don’t know how to be a dad. We all know to a certain degree how to be a good mom or dad, we can all learn to improve. The basic skills though are the child development skills. Once you know how to nurture a child’s natural curiosity, once you know how to stimulate them to move around in productive ways, once you stimulate them to look for creative solutions through conflict with other children, those are the skills you can apply across all their paradigm. 

00:05:05
TOM They just don’t understand. I don’t think parents… parents don’t really understand what… And they… And they really don’t care, you know sometimes. So they physically abuse you know. They… They got into a situation where their parents, they have kids and back with us they don't help you know. In… In the early 70s they really didn’t understand, really didn’t take time to say, hey, you know I love you or you know they just didn't know. 

00:05:50
2. It is a learned behavior 

00:05:55
I know about the grades you have been getting, what’s your excuse? 

00:06:00
Nothing, I just don't wanna have good grades. 

00:06:00
You don’t wanna have good grades! Well, I’ll tell you, my parents brought me up the way they were brought up, and I had good grades. And look at me, you get good grades, like I got good grades, like my father taught me and you’ll be alright boy. But you better get the grades up. 

00:06:20
No, I don't want to. 

00:06:20
I don’t care what you want. You gotto get your grades up. You gotta brother and a sister here, they are watching you. So you set the example, just like I did for my brother. My parents would have whipped me so hard if I didn’t do what you're doing. You gotto get those grades up. 

00:06:35
Yeah, I don't care if you whipped me I just gonna be the lazy but I don't want to. 

00:06:40
Now, look at this you are saying that in front of these two? 

00:06:40
I don’t care. I don’t care about them. 

00:06:45
I was brought up right, and I am gonna bring you up right. 

00:06:45
No you aren't. 

00:06:50
I am bringing you the way I was brought up. It’s a right way and you stick with it, because I am the man, I am the parent here, you are the kid. 

00:06:55
You are just a bad parent. 

00:07:00
I am not a bad kid you are the bad kid. I am not a bad parent you are a bad kid. My dad… 

00:07:05
Listen. 

00:07:05
…never had talked to me like this, like I am talking to you. 

00:07:10
OLIVER W. TUTHILL JR It’s because we model our behavior when we’re children on the adults that take care of us. We also learn to model our behavior by looking at other adults and how they parent. 

00:07:20
JIM MCDERMOTT Member of Congress 7th District, Washington First of all we learn to be parents from our parents. So, the first thing is how well that our own parents function as parents is the… is the basic ground that lays for your own ability to be a good parent. 

00:07:45
3. Drug and alcohol abuse 

00:07:45
Where… Where've you been? Why are you so late? 

00:07:50
Are you drunk again? 

00:07:50
Well I'm drunk, it doesn’t matter about me drinking. Were you with her? That's why you're… 

00:07:55
OLIVER W. TUTHILL JR It’s a crisis in our nation today with the abuse of drugs and alcohol. There is so many millions of people that abuse drugs and alcohol. And it’s difficult and unrealistic for us to expect somebody that’s intoxicated on a regular basis or someone that’s under the influence of drugs, be they illegal drugs or legal drugs, because there is a lot of abusive prescription drugs today, just as there is a lot of abusive illegal drugs. And so what happens when a parent is under the influence of drugs, it’s much more likely for them to abuse a child. 

00:08:30
JIM MCDERMOTT Well, there is no question that drugs and alcohol take the edge of your ability to think and cope with situations and that people do things under the influence of… of various kinds of drugs that… Again if you ask them would you do this they’d say no, but when they're drunk or when they’re whatever they do thinks that just appall us. 

00:09:00
4.Emotinal needs not met 

00:09:05
MJ I don’t think my mom’s emotional needs were ever met from even when she was a child. Her father was an alcoholic. Her mother was an alcoholic. And from an early age my mom was ended up being… my mom had to become mother to her own sisters. And then she met my dad who had a history and his own background of being neglected, not abused but neglected himself. His emotional needs were not met as a child. And so here you have two people who marry each other and neither have ever had their emotional needs met. They've never really been able to… Never really received love and therefore as a result they don’t know how to give it. My mom didn’t… didn’t receive the love and the affection that she needed from my father and neither did my father receive it from my mother. It's a very dysfunctional marriage. 

00:09:55
OLIVER W. TUTHILL JR Many parents will abuse their children because they're very unhappy people. There are lot of parents out there that love their kids, what's best for the kids. But they're very unhappy. Their emotional needs have not been met. They could be in a… in a bad relationship. We have intimate partner, they could be having problems at work, they could not have close friendships with people. And we as human beings, we need close relationships. We have needs for friendship, we have needs for someone that we love, we have needs for companionship. 

00:10:25
MARY LOU DICKERSON , MSW State Representative 36th District, Washington The first thing I'd like to say is that most parents who abuse are neglected kids, really wanna be good parents. They usually love their children and they wanna do the best they can. But often they don't have the tools to do that. Often they were abused or neglected themselves. So we all know, we've all heard about the cyclical nature of abuse. But there are other things as well as, because we know also that just because someone is abused doesn't mean that they are gonna abuse as parents. 

00:11:00
5. External Stressors 

00:11:05
My mom is freaking out. She is behind us. 

00:11:10
What are you doing on the phone? Get off the phone. I am so sick of you and your friends always gossiping. Just get off the phone. 

00:11:15
We're not gossiping. See what I mean. She is having a stress attack. She can't handle anything. 

00:11:20
Didn't I tell you to get off the phone. Jeez, I can't handle you, I can't handle your father. 

00:11:30
MJ I mean, he had four kids and a wife and a house payment and a car and my dad had sometimes had to hold down not having a professional degree, sometimes had to have two or three jobs. He'd work 16 hours a day, be dead dire to come home to hear my mom screaming and yelling about, Margi did this, Margi did that. And my mom yelling about how she was lonely and… and just screaming and… and… He couldn't handle it. He'd… He'd come home wanting to… wanting to have a wife who would give him some support when he came in the door and wanting to sit down and relax and have a quiet dinner and she'd be screaming in his face and yelling at him about everything that's going wrong. And rather than having dinner ready and made and mom being supportive to… and attentive to his needs, the dinner would hardly be started and there would be piles of laundry all over the dinning room table and mom would be yelling and screaming about everything. And dad at sometimes just lose it. And I'm not excusing his behavior, but it is just… it's understandable that he would lose his temper and become frustrated. 

00:12:30
JIM MC DERMOTT The situation so often in some young women is sitting there all by herself or the kid it's crying and she can't get the kid to stop crying and gets frustrated and does something that's horrible. 

00:12:40
OLIVER W. TUTHILL JR One of the reasons that parents abuse is that they're under tremendous pressure. We live in a very, very complicated world. We… We live in a… in a society where there is tremendous pressure. We're… We're under so much pressure, so much to demand to be on the run all the time, get to work, work hard, come on make money and get that new SUV and get that nice house and get that swimming pool. We gotto keep up with the Jones. We're expected to wear so many different hats. We're supposed to be home and be a good parent, but yeah we gotto go out, we gotto earn money. Lot of parents today, both parents have to work in order to support their children, their families and to maintain a home. And this… this… this pressure, this whole idea of being able to wear all these different hats, and to be a… a… an effective consumer, because we live in a society, we live in a consumerist society, we live in a very materialist society, where we are expected to spend our money purchasing products and services. And when this happens, it draws our attention away from taking care of our children. 

00:13:55
6. Immaturity 

00:14:00
What the hell are you doing? You can't be smoking. 

00:14:00
Of course, they just wanna have a bun. 

00:14:05
Yeah, I understand. But I mean, you gotta baby. You can't do this to the baby! 

00:14:05
I don't even wanna have this baby. You got me into this. 

00:14:10
What are you talking? We got each other into this. We're together on this. We all have to take of baby's well being. 

00:14:15
I don't even know what I am doing. I don't even know how to be a mom. 

00:14:15
That's okay, we will do it together, okay. I don't know anything either, but we'll… we can do this together. We got through it. 

00:14:20
How am I supposed to do this? 

00:14:25
Swear, I'll be by your side all the time, okay. I'll be here with you. Okay? 

00:14:30
OLIVER W. TUTHILL JR In the United States especially there is thousands and thousands of teenagers, some that haven't even graduated from high school, that have children. It really gets unrealistic and unfair of us to expect these parents to be capable parents. They don’t have the maturity, they don’t have the experience. They just haven't been through life for enough. 

00:14:55
7. Unrealistic Expectations 

00:15:00
What are you doing? You're just sitting over there and looking at the magazine for all those fancy things? We can't afford that. I don't make enough money for us. You need to go out and get a job. 

00:15:10
Me get a job? 

00:15:10
Yeah! 

00:15:10
I am 13 years old! 

00:15:15
Yeah! Well, I had a job when I was 13. I worked for grandma. You can go out and you'll get a job. I'll tell you what, I just can't afford that kind of stuff around here you know. And you… you should start pulling some more weight around here, maybe make breakfast and dinner for your little brother, you know, his… 

00:15:25
Why? You make breakfast! 

00:15:25
I get up and I'm getting ready for work. I barely only have enough time to get off to work in time. You could help out (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:15:30
My brother doing anything for me. 

00:15:35
You need to get a job and you need to start making breakfast for us, that's it. That's just the way it is. It's time for you to start pulling some weight around here and bringing in some money for this household. I just can't afford it by myself, you know. I try to give you nice stuff, but I just can't. So, it's time for you to get a job. Well find something you could do and you bring in some money for this house and help, pull some weight around here. 

00:15:50
I gotto school for seven hours. I come home (inaudible ) within 3 hours… 

00:15:56
There's plenty of time. You know, you go to school, you plenty of friends, only just plenty of time for you to get a job and work and bring in some money for this house. You know, it's… It's too stressful for me to go out and (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:16:05
Why don't you get a better job? 

00:16:05
So you have to go get a job. 

00:16:05
OLIVER W. TUTHILL JR You'll find parents that expect a 12-year-old to act like an 18-year-old. It's not realistic to expect a 5-year-old to make dinner every night for the parents. It's not realistic to expect a 12-year-old to go out and get a job and make money to help support the family. So, when a parent places unrealistic expectations on a child, this is a form of exploitation and a form of emotional abuse to that child. 

00:16:35
8. Social Isolation 

00:16:40
You're such a terrible kid. I don't know why I have you. 

00:16:40
It's not my fault. You don’t have any friends either. 

00:16:45
I shouldn't even have any kids. I don’t have to put up with this. Now get up there and clean up your room. 

00:16:45
No I won't do. 

00:16:50
I asked you to. So go up there now. Don’t argue with me. 

00:16:50
Hey, I can argue with you because I'm bullying too, and I am not ever gonna speak to you again because I hate you. 

00:17:00
I have bet my friends are better than you. 

00:17:00
I don't like you anymore. 

00:17:00
Get up there, go to your room. 

00:17:00
No. 

00:17:00
Don't treat me like this. 

00:17:05
I will never go. 

00:17:05
You are the worst kid in the world. Get up there. 

00:17:05
I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I want the whole world to know that I hate you. I never wanna see you again in my life. 

00:17:15
Good, then I will get you away. 

00:17:15
JIM MCDERMOTT Lots of abuse occurs because people are again isolated, trying to deal with the child and have no idea what they're dealing with. If… In the old days, when grandma showed up and grandma was with the young woman who has had the baby and there is a problem, grandma's got an idea about what that's about or give some advice. Today, lots of women are operating solely by themselves. 

00:17:40
OLIVER W. TUTHILL JR I know parents will… will abuse their children because they are socially isolated. Lot again mothers that have children are socially isolated because they're stuck at home with their kids. They can't go out, because well, they've got their baby with 'em or their two babies. And so they can't go out to visit their friends in many cases. They can't go to a movie. If they're estranged from their parents or there family, they're all alone. And a lot of mothers find themselves in situations where they are very isolated. And this is not conducive to good mental health. And so a parent that is socially isolated is much more likely to abuse a child than someone who is not, because again they're unhappy. 

00:18:25
9. The Parent is Evil 

00:18:25
School? School has been over an hour ago? 

00:18:35
It took long time to walk home. 

00:18:35
Oh, it took you a long time to home! You know why I'm waiting here sooner that this? 

00:18:40
I am sorry. 

00:18:40
Yeah! Well, you know what happens? 

00:18:40
What happens… No! 

00:18:40
That thing happens. Good baby! (crosstalk)(inaudible). I have lost the key. I hope the spiders will take care of you in the room. Hahaha… Scream! Hahaha… 

00:19:00
MJ I don’t believe my parents were evil. I do believe any human being, there is the possibility that a human being at some point in their life can choose to accept evil in their life. It doesn’t just happen. I don’t believe people just happen to become evil by accident. I believe that people who are evil have made a choice to accept evil in their lives. I believe people who are involved in witchcraft, in covenants and demon things and… and… and… and satanic masses, these people can choose to be evil or satan in their lives. Evil doesn't come in by accident, evil is chosen to come in. 

00:19:35
MARY LOU DICKERSON I think that… that there very well maybe a few parents who are just evil, but the vast majority of them are not evil, but they are in crisis. 

00:19:55
OLIVER W. TUTHILL JR Some parents just enjoy hurting kids. It's unfortunate, but I think we have to recognize that that exists. That some parents just enjoy hurting children. And it makes them happy to see their child in pain. And, I knew a woman myself once who had a… a… a small child, and she told me that she enjoyed hurting him. And I told her you need to get help. And she laughed in my face. That is evil. 

00:20:30
10. Low Self-Esteem 

00:20:35
OLIVER W. TUTHILL JR Having low self-esteem is a definite red flag in regards to treating your child well. It's… It's not realistic to expect a parent to be effective in treating a child well when they don't think well themselves. When a parent operates from a base of non-self-acceptance and self-contempt, which basically that's what self-esteem is, they don’t think very highly of themselves. How is it possible for a parent to relate to a child in a healthy manner when they have a low opinion of themselves? And how often this low opinion of themselves come off as having a low opinion of their own child, which again can resolve in treating the child unfairly and without compassion? And so many times, when a parent does have low self-esteem, it results in the parent abusing their child. 

00:21:25
TOM Abuse children physically and emotionally, I mean that's like a right. You know, your… your child… they got a child in front of 'em, that's a child that that they have to take care. He is a gift or she is a gift. You know, their younger life they're gonna… they're gonna be running the world when these parents are not able to defend for themselves or too old, these are… the children are the children of the future. 

00:21:55
OLIVER W. TUTHILL JR Child abuse can be eradicated from the landscape of our society. if we are willing to make the hard decisions and do the work necessary to realize its cessation. Abused children often grow into adults who abuse their own children, by passing the proclivities to maltreat and to their offspring in what psychologists label transgenerational transmission. By educating our children in interpersonal relationship skills, marriage and family and parenting competencies, we can end the blight of emotional child abuse as sure as we ended the blight of smallpox. Maltreated children are less likely to perform as productive adults and often drain the resources of our communities. We as a nation can no longer afford to see our children abused. A necessary step from any maltreatment is to understand why parents abuse. We can no longer rely upon the silenced to tell us that they are suffering. We must speak for them.
