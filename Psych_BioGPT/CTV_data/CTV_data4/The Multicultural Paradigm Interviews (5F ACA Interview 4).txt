4th Force: The Multicultural Paradigm Interviews 

00:00:00
Second Interview Patricia Arredondo, Ed.D. Associate Vice Chancellor and Dean, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Thomas Parham, Ph.D. Assistant Vice Chancellor, University of California, Irvine 

00:00:30
MAN I'm here with Dr. Patricia Arredondo and Dr. Thomas Parham and what we're here to do today is talk about multiculturalism as the 4th Force in counseling. Um, first I just want to say, thank you so much for coming here today. And taking time to uh, help us understand what multicultural counseling is. Both of you have been uh, in my experience pretty significant figures in helping to shape the movement, if you will. And uh, uh, help us understand what multiculturalism is and its relevance in counseling. What I wanted to begin with was just to talk a little bit about what got you involved with the multicultural counseling movement? How did that begin for you? 

00:01:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Well first I want to say thank you for continuing this work. Um, Thomas and I have been at this for a few years. Uh, I mean really a long time um, and it's very refreshing, encouraging, and validating to know that there is yet another generation of professionals who is advancing the thought on multiculturalism in counseling. So, thank you. 

00:01:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. And thank you as well. I mean it's our pleasure I think to be here but I think what, what Patricia talks about in, in reminding us about there's another generation coming behind. Um, we are really the latest arm of that legacy. Um, the great Algerian psychiatrist Fran Sanom(ph) reminds us that, that ever generation out of relative obscurity must reach out and seek to fulfill its legacy and portray it. And so as we have been nurtured and mentored by the elders who came before us, we are the latest generation of those who's come behind to really pick up and try to fulfill the legacy that they left us. And so what you see reflected in the work that we have tried to produce. And, and the bodies and the minds that we have tried to influence over the years has really been the fulfillment of that legacy. 

00:02:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. And nothing starts in a vacuum. You know, you, we've talked about it I believe in, in our writing and in our presentations about the historical context. And that, that historical context as, as Thomas eloquently said had a lot of uh, spokespersons. Perhaps they didn't have the kind of platform that is, you know, we're continuing to have now. Uh, at the same time that's why we are fortunate enough to reach into that uh, that history. That, that thought leadership that was going on for many years when it comes to speaking about the voices of the under-represented. The role of culture in our lives, how culture shapes all of us. You know, from our thinking to our values, to our behavior. And you know, that's embedded in what we have framed as um, multicultural competency and multiculturalism counseling. Uh, so it's not a historical, it's not a contextual. Uh, and it really does uh, address the, the phenomena of, of human development. 

00:03:50
MAN What is, you talk a little about there's a historical context within multicultural counseling. What is that? What is the history of multicultural counseling? What were the major events that helped shaped the movement? Who are the major figures in addition to yourselves, I think, who helped shape the multicultural counseling movement? 

00:04:05
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. For me the historical context for the, the multicultural counseling movement does not begin in counseling or psychology. For me, I think the historical context emerges outside of the disciplines. So that there is a personal context in which human beings decided that they wanted to stand up and demand that they be recognized as members of the human family. And so you begin to see that, that quest for human authenticity within the context of that. The second element behind the personal is the social. And so there are a number of social movements which, you know we'll talk about shortly that certainly have helped to shape the consciousness of a nation. That then permeated into the procession. Um, and then third, for me, there's an operational uh, element to it. So we move from the personal to the social to the operational where people said, I am now looking for ways in which I can operationalize this new sense of consciousness. This new sense of awareness, this new sense of social justice. This new sense of the need for validation and affirmation, etc. And those are the things that are then swept I think, into the movement. And so, then when you begin to look at the, the historical anchors from where that is. You can look at several things. You can look at um, civil rights certainly. 

00:05:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Absolutely. 

00:05:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. As, as the major force in that. Um. 

00:05:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Well you can link even further back. I mean I always think about, you know, the 1954. 

00:05:50
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right, Brown v. Board. 

00:05:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Brown v. Board of Education as significant to again that was a huge consciousness raising event for, you know, um, looking back on it as you read it. But you know that already was a marker in terms of the civil rights um, activity. 

00:06:05
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. And that to me is really about civil rights. But ironically about that um, if you think about that as a historical anchor the Brown v. Board of Education, was about African-American kids in Topeka, Kansas in 1954. Except uh, for those you know the history it begins really with brothers and sisters in both the Asian community and the Latino community uh, a few years before then when you find for example in the case of uh, Westminster v. Mendez. Um, that preceded Brown. 

00:06:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Uh-huh. That's true. 

00:06:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Even though it had the same players and, and the Thurgood Marshalls and the Judge Carters, and other folk who were uh, uh, working with the particular case even before Brown came. Um, Japanese farmers owned the land. They are uh, expected to be able to uh, work the land do that. Run into the questions about internment. And they are herded away. They lend the farm to Mendez family. Mendez family who was Latino then tries to pick that up and want to send their children to Westminster Schools. Who then deny them admission into the schools. So the Westminster fight had Asian roots, Latino roots, right. That then proceeds up to Brown v. Board of Education. I mean it's those kinds of social movements that were taking place all around the country. But it's the people demanding again, that human authenticity, demanding access to opportunity, and the privileges of full citizenship in those kinds of social movements; Brown v. Board of Education, Emmitt Till, Rosa Parks in Montgomery's uh, bus boycott, civil rights, Dr. King, Black power movements, um. 

00:07:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. And then. 

00:07:55
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. The Peace movement. 

00:08:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Well, and the Peace movement and then of course, the migrant farmers. 

00:08:00
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Migrant farmer worker, exactly. 

00:08:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Workers movement in here in California. Oh, you had all of these social, social movement. 

00:08:10
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:08:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. That were um, about rights, uh, about equity, about discrimination. And in putting it on the front page. 

00:08:20
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:08:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. You know, I was in Boston in the early '70s when they had a grape strike um, out in the supermarkets. So we were, we were told to boycott the grapes. And that was the way the movement had already mov-, you know, uh, taken a much more of a national scope um, and you didn't have to be in California to think about it. And you know, all. 

00:08:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. And that's the operational aspect. 

00:08:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yes. 

00:08:45
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. That we were talking about earlier. Sure. Yeah. 

00:08:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:08:45
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. So all those things I think had an impact on, on um, you know, what we do. Yeah. 

00:08:50
MAN So it sounds like the multicultural movement really developed, evolved as, it was really a microcosm of what was happening in society. 

00:09:00
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Exactly. 

00:09:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:09:00
MAN Uh, some are civil rights issues that were occurring, issues relating to equity really spurned the multicultural counseling movement and forced the field of counseling in psychology to look internally. In terms of what are we doing or not doing adequately to serve folks. 

00:09:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Well, and I think that we're probably being a little too um, generous by saying it, it um, led the professions to do that because you, you know, if you look at this from a structural standpoint, you know, whether it's ACA, or APA, I mean those structures were, you know, dominated by particular mid set that was not inclusive. 

00:09:40
MAN Right. 

00:09:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Obviously of multicultural thought. 

00:09:45
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Not just not inclusive but resistant. 

00:09:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Resistant too as well. 

00:09:45
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Yeah. 

00:09:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. So, I mean even at the time. And I forgot one more movement that was going on. Part of the civil rights, was the whole awakening of the women's movement. 

00:09:55
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:09:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. And how that uh, became also a force. So you had this convergence of force. But again to come back to your question. Uh, and you said it before Tomas. It where the individuals who really marshaled. 

00:10:10
MAN Yeah. 

00:10:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. The efforts. 

00:10:10
MAN Yeah. 

00:10:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. To begin with. 

00:10:15
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. And that's the piece that, that is so critical. I mean it's important I think for our viewers to understand that much like individuals go through developmental transitions in their lives so do social movements, and so do organizations. And since organizations are, you know, inhabited and you know, the, the membership roles have really filled up with individuals. The organizations themselves then move through similar developmental transitions and the same way that individuals do. And so, it's not unlikely that those things would ultimately go head to head with trying to decide, you know, what that, that force would be as it wound up against lack of inclusion as, as it butted up against elements of resistance. As it butted up against those things. but all that I think is part an parcel of, of what you're talking about in terms of that history of movement 

00:11:05
MAN So, what was happening in society was also happening in APA and ACA? 

00:11:15
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Oh absolutely. 

00:11:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. Oh, yes, yeah. 

00:11:15
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Absolutely. 

00:11:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. And you know, I can only, I'll speak more about um, ACA uh, and AMCD becau-, although I wasn't there at the time it, it started. But to Thomas' point uh, you know a group primarily of African-American professionals, um, championed by uh, Samuel Johnson. Who you know is very well-known in AMCD. I mean that's AMCD in many ways came to be was his, his stamina, his perseverance to, to bring this to fruition. And there's probably more details than you know, than we have time to talk about but it was those actions of exclusions that fueled the, the energy to persist. You know when you can't have a room for a session to meet and organize yourself, you know, you're, you're just not included even though you're a member of what was then the Personnel and Guidance Association. Um, all of that fuels people to take action and to empower themselves. 

00:12:25
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. And demand expression, exactly. 

00:12:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Absol-, yeah you have to. 

00:12:25
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:12:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. I mean, you know, you cannot be silenced, you know. We won't be silenced. And, and that was, you know, there's more history if we have some tapes I think by um, Samuel Johnson who was interviewed and talked about how all of this came about. Um, 1972, 1971, 72 I think that's when we were charted, um, as the. 

00:12:50
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:12:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Association of Non-White Concerns. Yeah. 

00:12:55
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. And that becomes, yeah, that becomes really the operational, you know, definition of what we talked about earlier. But it's important I think particular for, for professionals and students alike who will view the tape to not really have a surface structure understanding of what was going on. But rather really push to have a deeper structure understanding because to the, to the untrained eye you can look at for example American Psychological Association 1968 when a group of African-American psychologist decide we've had enough. And they break away from APA. And they're talking about issues of inclusion, they're talking about issues of legitimacy. They're talking about the particular theoretical frameworks that pathologize Black life so, you know, bad. They're talking about the testing movement and to the degree in which it had a detrimental effect on Black and Latino and Asian kids. I mean all those kinds of things were going on in the context. So when people look at ABSI in 1968 that becomes a precursor to a lot of this. The joint membership of some of these folk, the Sam Johnsons, the Tom Gunnings, the Gloria Smiths. 

00:14:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:14:00
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. The those folk early on who were involved in uh, what was the ANWC, the Association of Non-White Concerns of Personnel Guidance in early 70's, you know, they were deciding that we want to demand inclusion. And so what we will do is create our own, you know, associations. But the point being to the untrained eye looks like uh, these were just a group of frustrated, you know, people of color who decided they're gonna break away and do their own thing. I think at the deep structure level what you want to understand in my mind is that this was about a cultural war. When you think about war you think about really a protracted struggle. This was a protracted struggle around the ideology of different world views and how people were gonna operationalize that within the context of their own life space. And the battlefield was fought on academic institutions, community health centers, hospitals, training programs, and in effect even within the professional associations, like APA, ACA, etc. 

00:15:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. ACA. 

00:15:05
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. So if you think about a cultural war, what I talk about uh, is four elements. This was a war of ideology which world view in fact is going to be the one people embrace. It was also a war of cultural values and what are the values that we hold near and dear. The simplest one being, is it about individualism or about the collective, you know, group of, of the folk. Uh, it was a war of cultural relevance meaning if we're gonna develop theories and constructs are relative are they not just to the psychologist and the counselors but how relevant are they to the people. And fourth it was a war of self determination meaning real power is about the ability to define your own reality. And so as you look at people engaging in more self determined attempts to say let us define our own reality with our own segments and associations. With our own journals, with our own newsletters, with our own conventions within conventions all that was really about self determination. So when you think, for me at the deep structural level it's important I think for, our, our um, viewers to understand that this is really not just about frustrated people of color saying the institutions are just unresponsive to our needs. 

00:16:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. I think too, and, and also though in, in addition, I think it's that very important um, multidimensional way of thinking at it. That uh, I, I would want our viewers to take with them. 

00:16:35
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Mmm. 

00:16:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Uh, it's complex. 

00:16:40
MAN Mm-hmm. 

00:16:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. And uh, I think the way Thomas laid it out suggests that this is complex change and it's not a matter of taking a document and running with it. 

00:16:50
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:16:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Uh, fundamentally there's more that has to change for structurally as, as well obviously for individuals and groups. And you know, change never comes easily anyhow. Um. 

00:17:05
MAN It takes time. 

00:17:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. And it takes time. 

00:17:05
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. And that's why we're continuing to see um, changes movements, uh, what you're doing today which is 40, 50 years from when, when uh, AMCD started if we look, 72; my goodness. So we're, we're you know, looking at some uh, a need for more um, refining. Always, but you can't be complacent about any of this. 

00:17:30
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:17:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Um, I know uh, coll-, some of my colleagues were uh, reporting on a session they, they taught last night as a learning uh, conference here on supervision. And they took a poll of how many people had heard about the multicultural competencies. These are graduate students, okay, in our programs here. Less than half. 

00:18:00
MAN Hmm? 

00:18:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Okay. 

00:18:00
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Wow. 

00:18:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. This is 2012. 

00:18:00
MAN Hmm. 

00:18:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Uh, and, and I, I always find that perplexing. 

00:18:10
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. We were ruling incompetencies out in what early 90's. 

00:18:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. 90s, early 90s. 

00:18:15
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Early to mid-90s. 

00:18:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Early to mid-90s. So, we're talking about 20 years ago. Thomas this is 20 years from that article being published. My god we should of been, we have to celebrate that at the luncheon. Um, uh, my point is that there are a couple of, of generations of faculty who been talk in the milieu of the competencies. 

00:18:35
MAN Yeah. 

00:18:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. So, yeah. You, you, I can never rest um, thinking that we're home. 

00:18:40
MAN Right, right. 

00:18:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Um, that we're, our work is done. 

00:18:45
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. *** 

00:18:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Hardly, you know. 

00:18:45
MAN In some ways you're saying the movement has accomplished a lot and yet there's still. 

00:18:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Oh. You know, it's accomplished a lot, yes. I mean I think that the word multiculturalism doesn't scare people perhaps like it used to. 

00:19:00
MAN Yeah. 

00:19:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Um, and that the, the world actually, the, the change in the world I think has benefited. 

00:19:05
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Mm-hmm, for sure. 

00:19:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. The, the acceptance of looking at cross-cultural, multicultural issues, competency issues, and doing business internationally on our college campuses, the workplace. You know, cultural competency is what people talk about at work, not even language as much. It's the competency to work interpersonally, so. 

00:19:30
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Yeah, and that's the piece where you begin to see the discipline benefiting from the social movement internally. But now beginning to export its own theories and constructs into awareness to other disciplines outside. So, lots of us do consulting in organization development. So if you're in corporations they know the language of multicultural competence. You know, if you're, if you're looking at uh, law firms, they know the language of cultural competence. When you're looking at people serving as expert witnesses, they know the language of cultural competence. You know, when you look at law enforcement. 

00:20:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yep. 

00:20:00
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right. And having to work with uh, policing different communities. They know the language of cultural competence. So, in many respects the transformation that has occurred for me is not just about what we've done I think in, in the counseling profession. Again, picking up on the legacy that we were blessed to inherit by some of the early pioneers. Um, but also looking at the way in which uh, uh, other disciplines have begun to pick up the mantel as well. 

00:20:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. Its application narrow. 

00:20:30
MAN Yeah, yeah. 

00:20:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:20:30
MAN How, how did because the multicultural movement from what you're describing sounds like it really focused on issues of race and ethnic issues, and, and racism. How did other perspectives sort of join the movement; issues of disability, women's rights, gay and lesbian? 

00:20:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Mm-hmm. Well, I think, I think that if you. 

00:20:55
MAN To, to sort of. 

00:20:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:20:55
MAN Not. 

00:20:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Well, yeah. Absolutely. I, I don't think it was that narrow to begin with. Uh, because if you look at, at the original competencies, whether it was the document that Darryl and some folk wrote in 1982 and then the 1992. 

00:21:10
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:21:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. 1992 version that we were part of with Darryl and, Darryl Winsioux(ph) and Rod McDavis. You know, we were really looking at structural issues. 

00:21:20
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:21:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. And the effects of structural issues on client care. On um, you know, malpractices I call it. You know, you're doing malpractice because you're so culturally uninformed and the, the agencies are just not providing services that are going to benefit the client in need. The training programs are not preparing uh, our students for the real world, so if you look at those documents they talk about barriers. 

00:21:50
MAN Okay. 

00:21:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Um, to, to service barriers to effectiveness, ethical behavior that really was not benefiting um, the, the clients or and, and the, even the students we were teaching. So I think that's part of it but uh, I would say that in the early 90's I wrote a couple pieces on the woman factor in multicultural counseling. And, it to me that was a big issue, you know, it's, it's part of our, our history too of, of you know, gender and equities. 

00:22:25
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:22:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. And sexism. And if you look at the 1996 document on operationalization is where we talked more comprehensibly about multiple identities that we need to be knowledgeable about. You know it's not. 

00:22:45
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Except if you look at that the, let's, let's leave and pick up on that. If you think about where, you know we wrote about that. Particularly I think with, with you and Rebecca and other folk picking that up. 

00:22:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:22:55
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Uh, Rebecca Touper, we're talking about, um, and others. That was 25 years removed from when these associations and the movements first began to take hold within the counseling profession. So, you know, if, if we don't get ourselves caught in a, in, in a, in the time warp. 

00:23:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. This time warp. Yeah. 

00:23:15
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Um, you know, we, we, we sometime have a tendency to in some cases almost delude ourselves into believing. 

00:23:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Oh, wow. 

00:23:20
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. That somehow things were always like this. I think it wasn't. I think in, in my memory, in the original multicultural movement that took place even in that cultural war, the war was primarily about race and ethnicity because the, the country at that point was so focused on the discrimination and oppression that was endured by people of color. 

00:23:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Right. 

00:23:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. And so when you look at the original documents even when, when uh, um, uh, the, the Association of Non-White of Personnel and Guidance started um, you had primarily uh, African-American folk in the forefront of that. What those elders had the good sense to say that we want to invite to the table, brothers and sisters from other. 

00:24:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Cultural groups. And they even put a provision. 

00:24:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. It's provided in the bylaws. 

00:24:10
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. You found it in, in the bylaws. 

00:24:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:24:10
MAN Mmm. 

00:24:10
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. That said that we will create Vice Presidential spots for the next group that has a certain threshold of membership. And they were looking for Latino folk, and Asian folk, and Indian folk, you know. Um, and so, there was less conversation at that point I think about gender. There was less conversation about disability. There was less conversation about uh, sexual orientation. You know, those things I think emerged, I think much later on. 

00:24:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah, yeah. 

00:24:35
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. And I think Patricia's right that when you look at Darryl's document. When Allen Ivey served as President of Division 17 in APA, Darryl produced for him as part of a committee, a report that was ultimately submitted and received by APA Division 17. But never really acted upon this. 

00:24:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. But it sat on the shelf. 

00:24:55
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. It sat on the shelf really. That was 1981. And so, that one begins to put in some of the structural elements that provide a different layer of inclusiveness. But even remember it's a decade removal from even when it first began. So even from that point to then go to '96 when you're doing that magnificent work with operationalizing it and putting in all those other elements of, of inclusion. 

00:25:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Identity, yeah. 

00:25:20
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. That's another 15 years even from that. So you get, you get a chance to see the, the, the inclusion and the progressiveness. But the other piece, you know, I don't want to say that it was just our all evolving, you know, consciousness that says we need to be more inclusive. Part of including that, also there was an element of resistance. 

00:25:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:25:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Like we never thought about gender because women were such a part of the movement that we were involved in. You know, so that the relationship between gender and race and ethnicity overlap pretty clearly. But when you look at the other elements of diversity what we saw was the profession itself beginning to. 

00:25:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:25:55
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Embrace that. Not so much the, the people of color. So the counseling association said well let's think about disability. And the um, counseling association said, let's think about gender. And the counseling association said let's think about the internationalization. Those things began to happen. But one of the things that we saw on the, from the, you know, the background is that you could address sexual orientation, disability, um, and you know, other elements of diversity even social class and never change the color. And so, that's where, when the movement began to came in you began to see people begin to look back and go uh, is that broadening inclusion a threat to the progress that we are making on these core issues? And so we had to, I think, work through some issues with that. 

00:26:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:26:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. In order to say, no it isn't a threat. 

00:26:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:26:45
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. It really is inclusion, is really gonna help everybody. 

00:26:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Correct. 

00:26:45
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. But that's what you see going on I think in that 25 years span and then a 10 year span, and a 15 year span, up to '96. And I think it's now kind of common place. 

00:26:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. And you know that, and, and you, Thomas you bring up a really important point that, that happens where we have um, actions and movements and conscious raising, um, led by, you know, people like us who, you know have seen the disenfranchisement uh, within the Association, within the profession, you know, for, for the people we serve. That it, that it is important for us to um, check with each other because, you know, we could also feel like, you know, we're, our multicultural movement is left behind because now it's all about women or now it's all about. 

00:27:35
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:27:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Um, um, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender issues. Rather I think to the inclusion point what began to happen were co-movements that, that speak about the inclusion because you have people at the table who were really think about all of these um, uh, necessities to bring women in, to, to um, to give voice to what hadn't been um, at the table. And I just have to point out the women thing because I, I have historically championed that as well. And in the mid, I think it was mid '80's in ACA and I was active in ACIS. I was Junior Professor and um, I don't know if I told this story on tape before. But I was at a luncheon at a I guess we were AACD then or one, one of our names. And this was my second luncheon and the only people getting awards were men. And the woman who was up there was like handing the award. Which was, you know, too classic at the time. And I, I was just, just beside myself and uh, just had met some other women and during the winter organized a group of women from ACIS to come to the next conference which was in Houston and create uh, the Women's Interest Network within ACIS. Uh, which I know still goes on. And I think what's important in the work we do also is the extent which we can institutionalize. 

00:29:20
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Correct. 

00:29:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. So these movements have a life that exist and, and continues long after those of us who perhaps championed it to begin with, you know, our moving on to other interest or. You know, so that the fact is that there's ,it's still relevant. 

00:29:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:29:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Uh, there's still a need for it. There's still women who co-less around it. And I remember when I was President of uh, AMCE in '95,'96 and at the table where other, the Presidents of other associations uh, Ackelbig(ph) at the time was not a, a division. And um, that was probably one of the, the fact that we had generated the '92, '96 versions of the competencies was uh, another point of, of convergence. And I, what, what's the word when you, when people come together sort of uh, you know. 

00:30:20
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Collaboration. 

00:30:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Coalition building, yeah. Uh, collaboration, collation building it was a sense of empowerment, you know. You, you, you know, AMCD was able to pull this off and give, was giving more fuel then to Ackelbig. 

00:30:30
MAN Yeah, yeah. So, it sounds like the multicultural movement has really gone from an exclusive definition of multiculturalism to an inclusive definition as it really embraced what Adrae Lar(ph) talks about and that's there's no hierarchy of oppressions. 

00:30:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah, right. 

00:30:45
MAN That it's all harmful and it's really about working collaboratively, power numbers in numbers to address our concerns. You talk uh, uh, throughout this interview about the competencies. Uh, what are the multicultural competencies in a nutshell? 

00:31:05
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Um. 

00:31:05
MAN Cuz, they seem they've been really important in helping shape the movement. 

00:31:10
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Well it's been a, been a, been a critical not only movement but, but um, really document that allows us to really again move to that space of how, how do we operationalize this. That people have developed the, um, the mindset that says I need to me more culturally competent. For me the two most important questions in therapy are either what and how. What I want to do; how do I do it. The profession was clear that what it needed to do was to be more multicultural competent. What it didn't have, you know, much of a clue about was how do I do it. So if I line up an African-American, an Asian-American, Chicano-Latino, American Indian, you know folk in chairs and said to any clinician who would sit on the other side, "How would your theoretical approach vary based upon the culture of those particular individuals that you're seeing?" And most folk couldn't pass that test. Because they know they need to be more culturally sensitive. But what does that mean? They know they need have an understanding of world view. But what does that mean? They know they need to have techniques that are based on, on the culture and the lifestyles and the mindsets, and the values, and morals and customs and traditions of those people who are culturally different but didn't have a sense of that. So, what we were able to do in producing that, um, in fact the first document in '92. 

00:32:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:32:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Came out of in fact of uh, uh, some friends doing some favors really. Um. 

00:32:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yes. 

00:32:50
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Because I had to, when I, when I was President of AMCB I said I will not leave this Presidency and not having, you know, produced a couple of fundamental documents. Um, one of them was to pull together Darryl Su, Rod McDavis, Patricia Arredondo. I said, I need to twist some arms. I didn't have to do much twisting, they were more than glad to do it. I said, but I want to come out of this Presidency having produced a document that tells people how we do this. So, it's out of that piece with stellar work they did as a, as a committee. And Patricia and, and Rod and Darryl produced that document that then we received. But strategically what we decided to do was also to publish. 

00:33:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:33:30
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. That document rather than sit it on a shelf, like Division 17 did with Darryl's piece in '81. We published it in two places. 

00:33:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Two places. 

00:33:35
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. We published it in the AMCD journal so that the people of color would see it. But we also, (crosstalk) right. 

00:33:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:33:45
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development. But we also published it in. 

00:33:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. JCD. 

00:33:45
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. The JCD. 

00:33:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:33:45
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. In the Journal of Counseling Development for the broader association. 

00:33:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:33:50
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. To be able to see. Because we knew that some of them would not read the, the AMCD journal. And so that was really the, the, the context in which a lot of that occurred. And, and that was so central to that. But what's important about even looking at the competencies, we looked at developing awareness, we look at developing knowledge. 

00:34:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Uh-huh. 

00:34:10
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. And we looked at developing skill. In that sequential order. And what we wanted to do I think in terms of institution building we were talking about earlier is the multicultural movement and its strength cannot be based on personality. 

00:34:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Right. 

00:34:25
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. So whether the Joe Whites of the world, you know, seminal thinker in what we've done. The Sam Johnsons of the world, the Carol Attneys of the world, the Rico Trus of the world, the Stanely Sus and Darryl Sus of the world. The Allen Iveys of the world, the Paul Petersons of the world, all those other folk who have been the elders of the profession have really given us lots of that information. If it's only personality driven then when those personalities fade so does the movement. Our job was to try to institutionalize it in a way that said irrespective of whose doing a lecture or you know, who's reading it the principal is sound. And the principal of the competency said, no we're not gonna start with give me 25 words or less without commercial interruption. No, we're not gonna start with here's the one book to two books you can read to enhance your knowledge base. What we're gonna start with is mindset that says, if we can't help you interrogate the basis and assumptions you bring with you into this therapeutic space, the awareness piece then all else is for not. So that's why it starts sequential with awareness. Then moves to knowledge, to say let's enhance your knowledge base, and then finally to the techniques and skills that help you operationalize it. 

00:35:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. And understanding that the, the techniques and skills are the nexus, it's sort of an inner dependent nexus of the awareness, knowledge, and skills. Skills never happen indepen-, as you know independently of, of the knowledge, uh, and of the skills. And again when I think ab-, uh, and the awareness rather. When I think about the knowledge too, uh, as we described it, it's not just what do I know about a Mexican-American woman or a Mexican-American college student, where is she? Is she on a, at a college campus? Is she from Texas versus Florida? Uh, you know, what is, what are her achievements goals? What is the class? So it's more complicated than simply knowledge around culture and you know, the stereotypes that come in when you just think of, of culture from you know, the menu of attributes of a person. And then so much that uh, I think how this has continued to be a force. And I'm not sure we're answering your question cuz it's all so organic. 

00:36:45
MAN You are! 

00:36:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Good. But I think about what Thomas said, it's not about uh, personalities. And yet how we've moved from the '80s a number of us together, the '80s, the '90s to where we are today it's been intentionally uh, and intentional engagement that we knew that publishing the documents was on piece of dissemination and one way that we communicated the knowledge. But we needed to have training institutes. We needed to come to ACA and ensure that the programs were not going to be hit or miss when it came to talking about multicultural issues. We charged and, and at that ACA have criteria in the program that speaks of, that includes diversity, addressing diversity as one of the criteria. So, we were really also looking at informing organizational change. I guess what I would also like to add is and, and we know that a lot is the development of more identity movements, uh, competency movements related to identity groups, I guess is what I could say. 

00:38:00
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:38:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. With those same, the tripod model of awareness, knowledge and skills for working with American Indians or First Nation's People in Milwaukee, we call in Wisconsin it's First Nation's People and I think it depends on where you are geographically. You know, the competencies for working with Latinos. Now, that again is a very pan ethnic word. Uh, when you talk about that you, you get a little deeper. Competencies for working with gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender. 

00:38:30
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. That's right. 

00:38:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Transgender individuals, and I know there are uh, documents for working with transgendered individuals. 

00:38:35
MAN Yeah. 

00:38:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Competency statements. So I just think that this movement continues to uh, empower as I said. Empower identity groups and actually those groups as well consider the, the interdimensionality or multidimensionality of the identity. 

00:38:55
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:38:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Because you can be Latino and you can be wealthy, and you can be Latino and you can come from the migrant farm family situation. So it, it really challenges us to think complexly. 

00:39:10
MAN Yeah. 

00:39:10
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:39:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. I think that's one of the things it's, it's, you know multicultural uh, competencies, the whole movement is about complex thinking, analytical thinking, uh, perspective taking. 

00:39:20
MAN Yeah. 

00:39:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Uh, you know, challenging again our fundamental biases and assumptions about our lives, needless to say and also the lives of others. And you know, what, what's fair and what's not fair. 

00:39:35
MAN Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:39:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. In life, you know. Any, anyway I was gonna go down a. 

00:39:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. No, but the, the, what's true about that and, and picking back up on the question. It's important I think that people not just learn kind of the breath of the multicultural counseling. Which is where people are moving in terms of force but the depth. 

00:39:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:39:55
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. And I think what I hear in, in Patricia's remarks is really talking about the depth. Just like, if you think about the movement and the force and how the competencies are the latest attempt to operationalize that. The, the force has always been about human authenticity. 

00:40:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:40:10
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. It has always been about trying to counter some of what we saw traditional uh, counseling and psychology with respect to pathology with strength. So, now it's strength versus pathology. 

00:40:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Strength based. 

00:40:20
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. It's always kind of the collective versus the individual. You know, it's always about those elements that are there that look at that. But at, at a deep structure level what we're really talking about is the cultural movement. And the cultural movement is not simply about the people. It's not simply about the, that's perhaps one of the greatest misunderstandings of the multicultural movement and the force is that, you know, there's a uh, uh, uh, sameness between skin color and consciousness. You know there's a sc-, a sameness between demographic you represent and the competency that you display. And it isn't. At a deep structural level what we're really talking about in culture is really a, a complex constellation of, of these morals and values, and customs, and traditions that really provide a general design for living in a pattern for interpreting reality. So the question that becomes, if you're looking across at a client or you're looking at a student in the classroom or someone in the community that you're, you're training or consulting with, what is there design for living and what patterns do they use to interpret reality. So when you think about understanding the competencies at a deep structural level it's not just the breath of the awareness, knowledge, skill, and all. 

00:41:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:41:35
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Even the, the different domains that, that we put in there. At the depth of that to me is really an understanding of five elements of culture. One is ontology, what is the ontological assumptions. What's the nature of reality for different people? Second would be axiology(ph), meaning what is the value system that people embrace. The third element of culture would be cosmology, meaning what is the relationship between the people and the divine force in the universe. Because we talk a lot about. 

00:42:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Spirituality. 

00:42:10
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Spirituality is one of the. 

00:42:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:42:10
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Fundamental differences between our, our movements and, and traditional psychology and counseling. The fourth would be pistonology, what is your system for knowing and understanding what is true. And the fifth would be praxis, meaning what is the system for human contact and human interaction. So that if you look at those five elements: ontology, axiology, cosmology, pistonology, and praxis and you look those then across different elements. So whether you are African-American, Asian-American, Latino, Caucasian, uh, American Indian, International, whatever the group is you can always find that they're ways in which people relate to that at the cultural deep structural level that is operationalized within the context of the competencies that, that uh, that we developed. 

00:42:55
MAN And, and just, it sounds like the multicultural counseling movement in a nutshell is sort of pushed back against the first and second and third force which really operates on a one size fits all approach. 

00:43:10
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Absolutely. 

00:43:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:43:10
MAN This theory will apply to any client, all clients. 

00:43:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Well. 

00:43:15
MAN And, and multiculturalism has said, well not really. I mean, that sounds challenging so, for, for counselors. 

00:43:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:43:25
MAN So what's the by in for counselors to operate from a multicultural? 

00:43:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Well, understandably those forces, you know, existentialism and, and um. 

00:43:35
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Psychodynamic. 

00:43:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. CBT and psychodynamic, you know, they're not going away. And they will always exist. And, and, and there are um, they're, it's a methodology for working. Um, I think it's a world view. Uh, all be it um, I could be doing CBT therapy but I still have to think about the multicultural framework that I would introduce in, in that kind of therapy modality. Um, and you know, it does, and, and, same thing I remember when I was back East in Psychodynamic Theory, and I had a client from Latin America who had been in more psychodynamic theory, psychoanalytic you know, theory and I, she's Latina, an immigrant from Columbia. But you know, anybody who's in psychoanalytic, I mean if, if you're aware, you know, it's only for privileged people. 

00:44:30
MAN Mm-hmm. 

00:44:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. And, so she came from uh, a different sort of context and some of the Puerto Rican people I was working with in Boston. 

00:44:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:44:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. And, so you have to adjust. So from a cultural standpoint I understood it. I'm not uh, I don't practice psychoanalysis. I didn't at the time. But what I'm saying is you do have to look at the cultural aspect regardless of the modality uh, that we're talking about. The second thing I want to add and it's to bu-, actually to build what Thomas said in terms of the uh, understanding uh, the client or all of us understanding ourselves. You know, you take it to the supervisor and, and where the supervisor's mindset is um, around praxis, around cosmology. 

00:45:20
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:45:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. And this is where we do have a lot of achilles' heels in the profession um, because our supervisors I believe still work from a paradigm that's, that's very status quo. 

00:45:35
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Yeah. 

00:45:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. And, and they, I, I only see it because I've have had doctoral students who did their dissertations in the supervision area. And uh, they were kind of blown away because they had come out of a very strong, multicultural movement at ASU and you know, we lived and breathed it. And they're doing their dissertations in, in college counseling centers where we think that there's more, you know, awareness of, of multicultural competencies. And um, you know, to find out and I'll just give one real small example where the supervisor was not bringing up issues with the supervisee uh, because he wasn't sure how to talks, talk about LGBTQ issues with the supervisee. 

00:46:25
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. So their own, you know, discomfort with that. 

00:46:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:46:30
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. And see, and see part of. 

00:46:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. What a loss, what a loss. 

00:46:30
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Well, and clearly uh, around all those dimensions of, of culture and competence we talk about. But what's interesting in terms of a phenomena that, that you highlight very clearly is we are now entering probably the second generation of trainees who are coming through in young professionals who still need supervision for licensure or you know, to get out the doctoral or masters programs, who are actually more cultural competent. 

00:46:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Than their supervisors. 

00:46:55
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Than the people who supervise them. 

00:47:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:47:00
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. And so that's the tension I think. 

00:47:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. That's. 

00:47:00
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. That Patricia talks about. But backing up also to the, to the, to the uh, uh, the question about you know, the, the, the kind of the form and the force. It isn't that we were just pushing against the theories. You know, the, the psychodynamic, the existential, the cognitive behavioral or whatever. But we have to understand is even if you grapple with human authenticity, even as you grapple with, you have to find strength and not just pathology. Even as you grapple with we have to find, you know, collective sense of consciousness not just you know, focus on the individual. What we're really talking about there is, is a fundamental understanding of the human condition. And that as we are trained to use theories as sets of abstract concepts that we use to make sense out of data that we see. In my mind there ought to be something wrong with a theoretical approach that leaves any client or a people strangers to themselves, aliens to their culture, oblivious to their condition, and inhuman to their oppressors. And that's to me what some of these theories did. 

00:48:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Right. And, and I think too if you, there, there's a piece that I still like to quote that was published in '88 on neglecting the cultural factor in counseling, and neglecting the cultural factor in psychology. And why do we neglect it? And I think it speaks to some of what Thomas is saying, is you know focus too much on the pathology. You know looking at biological explanations for people's conditions versus looking at the so-, society and, and policy and legislation that you know, oppresses people. So, we overly focused on the biological, you know, second was the whole ideology in the United States that we're all equal, that everyone has the same, you know, rights to access and to freedom. And so, if we really believe that, I mean philosophically fine, you know that there's. 

00:49:00
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:49:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Equal rights. But we know in practice that doesn't happen. 

00:49:00
MAN Yeah. 

00:49:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. So, you know, and then there's also, you know, using stereotypes was another as, as neglecting youth. I think I know you because uh, you now, I think you're Asian-American maybe, you know. And, and but then, you know, obviously that's so superficial. Um, the fourth reason was that there was just the fear of, of getting to know people. 

00:49:25
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Mmm. 

00:49:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Who are different from ourselves. 

00:49:30
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:49:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Because, you know, uh, some people just have, some individuals just have the convenience in life to, to not have to do that and figured uh, why. I mean I can go back to the mid '80's when I was teaching at BU and, and one of my doctoral students who said, "I don't know why we have to take this multicultural counseling course because I'm not gonna work with people like "that"." And I said, "Okay.", you know. So here's the moment of truth. Um, the point is that, that's, that was another reason we neglected it as, you know, professors thinking well, I'm not preparing students for that. 

00:50:05
MAN Yeah. 

00:50:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. That kind of clientele. So, you know, you, you look at reasons and this is where I think those of us who work so hard at this is you have to think all the way around, you have to have like this, this 360 perspective uh, to anticipate what the um, the dissing is going to be about. You know, what the resistance is going to be about. You have to think. I remember in some of the literature we talk about being hyper vigilant. Which, you know, is hyper vigilant in a different kind of sense. 

00:50:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. (inaudible ) right. 

00:50:42
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. But you know, you have to, to be, you know, you're, you're mindset has to be 360. So what is going to be the opposing viewpoint on why the competencies aren't endorsed. 

00:50:50
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:50:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Um, so we, we can never be I think se-, rest on our morals that. 

00:51:00
MAN Yeah. 

00:51:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. This is morally sound, you know, as Thomas said, we really argue about how important it is to change structures to prepare the next few generations of people who are going to be practicing and living, and working in a very different society. 

00:51:20
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. And to not do so without relying on other folk. I mean the, in the 2002 book I wrote on the counseling persons of African descent, I devote an entire page to one line. And the publisher's said, "You don't want to do a whole page." "Yes, I do." The first line of the book in the preamble says, "Healing is therapeutic but not all therapy is healing." 

00:51:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Right. Right. 

00:51:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:51:45
MAN So, you talk a lot about the benefits of multicultural counseling for counselors, for clients. You talked a little bit about the challenges. For example supervision uh, and the lack of cultural competence around supervisors. Where do you see the movement heading in the future, the multicultural counseling movement? As you look at where we've been, where we're at, where we're going? Or where does it need to go? 

00:52:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. It's going to continue to a movement that um, informs the profession of, of counseling. All be it, I think there're uh, times um, and I remember this book about the conspiracy theories, right. But I won't go there, conspiracy theories back in the early '80's. Um, what, what I think is development of, as we both said earlier this, this generation of leaders who will continue to expand on the um, the basis of, of the framework for multicultural counseling. The, sort of the beliefs, uh, the philosophy, and the, the practice side of it. Uh, and it in a way that uh, begins to demonstrate change in the lives of people. Now that's gonna be the hardest thing to do because we continue to uh, get asked about data, you know. Show us the data. You know, how is multicultural counseling. 

00:53:20
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Empirically based. 

00:53:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Empirically based. 

00:53:20
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Different, even a different world view assumption. 

00:53:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yep. 

00:53:25
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. You know, I think for me the movement is gonna continue to grow and I think it will do that but its growth will also bring with it some danger points. 

00:53:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:53:35
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. For me the biggest danger point is the one, on two levels. The first is, how do we sustain the momentum without losing the substance? Because what, what passes for multicultural competence nowadays in some cases is very substantive. But in some cases what passes is just comical. So we've got to be able to sustain the momentum but also not lose the substance. The other piece is we have to teach our students that, you cannot be a healing presence. Counselors and psychologist, we are healers. And you can't be a healing presence in the lives of other people if you lose the capacity to believe people can, can. 

00:54:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:54:15
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Elevate themselves to rightful places of leadership and mastery over their own circumstance. And so, there has to be a level of social engineering that is tied to what we do. And the same thing we do around social justice it is not just about treating clients in the individual context of. 

00:54:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Right. 

00:54:30
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Therapy but in fact uses the force and the profession to be able to transform within lives of people and transform the larger society. 

00:54:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. And, and this is where the whole piece on, on the social justice. 

00:54:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:54:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Movement comes in and, and the real uh, boundary, less tie in together. Uh, is that the, the advocacy part of social, of the social justice movement is so important for involvement of our clients, of ourselves to see how we can affect change at a local level. 

00:55:05
MAN Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:55:05
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:55:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. And, and you know, that's without being grandiose, I you know, I can't change society but locally I can work with a couple of MPS schools, Milwaukee Public Schools uh, through a math literacy program that you know, empowers the, the counselor who's there, the teachers, the kids ultimately, and I, I, I really believe it does uh, require us to look at these, and it's not random acts of kindness this is intentional acts that will help to change systems. And, and using our consciousness to change the systems, our, our knowledge to change the systems and, and not have expectations that we're gonna change the whole school system. But maybe we'll effect change in that particular building. And you ask me before about, you know, where we're going and where social justice fits in? I think the advocacy movement and the multicultural movement are both forces that are, are just interdependent. 

00:56:10
MAN Yeah. They, they seem to be complementary forces, sort of two sides. 

00:56:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:56:15
MAN Of the same coin. You can't do one without the other. 

00:56:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Correct. 

00:56:15
MAN You talked a lot about a lot. Um, I want to thank the both of you for your time. Um, your passion for, for helping to develop the movement that you continue work in. 

00:56:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Well. 

00:56:30
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. We appreciates it and thank you. And, and beyond thanking even the viewers, I hope what happens is that the ancestors the elders who have really given us the shoulders that we stand on will be pleased with the work we do. And hopefully the students that we have trained and the professionals we've impacted will in fact be motivated and excited enough, stimulated enough by the work we've done to continue this on so that we all continue to fill that legacy rather than betray it. 

00:56:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO, ED.D. Well, it's a lifelong journey. 

00:57:00
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Yeah.
