THINKING ALLOWED with Jeffrey Mishlove 

00:00:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello! and welcome, I am Jeffrey Mishlove, today we will be focusing on the art of Psychotherapy, with me is Dr. Irvin Yalom, a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University. Dr. Yalom is the author of numerous books on psychotherapy including Existential Psychotherapy, the theory in practice of group’s psychotherapy. Every Day Gets A Little Closer, A Twice-told Therapy, a novel called When Nietzsche Wept and Love’s Executioner. Welcome Irvin. 

00:01:00
IRVIN YALOM Thank you very much. 

00:01:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It’s a pleasure to be with you, your approach to psychotherapy is… is somewhat unique in the sense that you are willing to be controversial and innovative trying to strike a balance I think between rigid orthodoxy in psychotherapy and… and those who on the other hand value innovation for its own sake. One of the areas, that you have, people have commented most I think about your work has to do with your willingness to interject your own personality into your therapy and often your own vulnerability. So, I wonder if you comment on that. 

00:01:35
IRVIN YALOM, MD LOVE’S EXECUtionEer Well, yeah I think that, certainly as… as I have aged perhaps matured as a therapist have been more willing to… to shows more of my uncertainty to the patient you know I think that… that… that being uncertain is a large part of psychotherapy it's a large part of life and is something that is quite uncomfortable for… for as therapists and that a… that many therapist really I think, involve themselves sometimes in a… a carefully structured educational therapeutic program and almost it’s a way of perhaps avoiding facing, dealing with, acknowledging some of the uncertainty that comes with the therapeutic venture. So, perhaps some of the things that I have been… I have been willing to… to express and to acknowledge the patient I've got to do with my own… my own not knowing or my own willingness to work with the patient, struggle with the patient to sort of for us to be allies together in the therapeutic venture. 

00:02:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I am interested in the term, allies and I know one… one of the case histories you… you wrote about, you… you used the term that was very important for you to treat your client as an equal which seems in… in some ways to contradict the idea of a doctor and a patient it's not usually an equal relationship and… and yet the idea of an equal partnership does seem important is… is part of a therapeutic alliance. 

00:03:10
IRVIN YALOM Yeah, equal in that we are both, we are both exploring together that its you know, I… I… I don’t have a sense that I have a… a tremendous leap ahead of the patient in terms of what I know about where the patient has to go? And what the patient has to discover? I think things work much better if there is a certain sense of spontaneity, the wonder of… of us both discovering, and exploring something together and I think in the same way perhaps I… I think that, perhaps self-revelation on the part of the therapist is… is being quiet important and, one of the things that I… that I feel I have been willing to do with patients is to engage in more of my own sort of feelings there is a… a book that I wrote called Every Day Gets little closer in which, both the patient and I wrote summaries of the… of each therapeutic session it was a patient who was stocking therapy and also was a… a good writer a very good writer, but had a writing block so it’s a way of… of helping her get past the writing block. I… I suggested that we… that we each… that she write a summary of each other's sessions that we had and I promised to do the same and then every… every few months we exchanged summaries so she read mine I read hers that was also an exercise in… in self-disclosure and was a way to help her breakthrough some of the idealized images that she had of me after we did this for a… for a period of a year and a half and I think things worked very well in therapy it seem to me as I used this these notes so with my students that perhaps that might be almost like in a epistolary novel so we published them together and its very interesting to… to take a look at the differences in perception of the patient has of an our and you have on ours, so a kind of a… of a Rashomon experience you know all the things that I value in the our of these elegant interpretations I made, I learned that she never really heard them you know and the things that she valued were the rather subtle delicate personal things that went on between us that… that I hardly even… that I hardly even registered. 

00:05:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE One of the main issues in the therapy is how much a therapist should offer in interpretation, I have actually you read one account in which it suggested that any attempt to interpret before the patient is an example of counter transference or projection of your own feelings onto the patients situation I… I get the impression from you… you are more willing to risk counter transference to throw yourself into this situation and see what happens? 

00:06:05
IRVIN YALOM Yes, that’s right I mean I think of the… if the relationship is working and if you are both working together to the creative relationship then any single statement that one makes who doesn’t make to the patient isn’t going to turn the whole course of therapy I mean much more willing to take chances otherwise you get caught into a kind of a eggshell approach to therapy and then it's so careful to word everything and precisely the right way out, I think I am more willing to stumble and bumble through with patients as… as long as I can acknowledge things that I said the perhaps I am sorry that I said, are… are… are didn’t feel they perhaps were correct. 

00:06:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, a lot of therapist they think tend to… to take a very different attitude that you know the dignity of the therapist the… the magic of… of the idea that you know what’s going on is… is important its… it's almost as if perhaps they hide behind that or… or they use it in a almost mystical way to… to motivate their clients and I… I guess in your working you are trying to breakdown those kinds of illusions. 

00:07:10
IRVIN YALOM Yeah, I… I… I absolutely do feel that way, I… I want to share with the patient what I know and what I don’t know as something I… I felt was important as… as long as I can remember doing therapy; for example, for years in my… in my therapy groups, I have made a practice of after each group therapy session dictating and having transcribed a long summary of the group… of the therapy group meeting, and then mail that out to the patient's before the next meeting so they have a pretty good view of how I saw therapy, how I saw the group the things that I… that I wished I had said but didn’t or the things that I did say, and wished I hadn’t and all the various views that I had of the group and these summaries I think of patients from time to time read over a… a few months at a time I think give a good running commentary on the progress and process of the therapy of themselves and as… as well as the development of the group. So, that… that… that something I have done for a long period of time as well as that when I've had observers in a… in therapy say in a… at a therapy group I have often trained my students in group therapy one of the… one of the most important things for them to do is to watch someone who is an experienced therapist do, therapy do a group. But then I were often a rather than simply have these therapists view from a one way mirror and the patients never see them, I find it very useful if I can bring them in at the end and one thing I have done is perhaps have the patients just switch chairs so they go into the observation room and listen to our discussion afterwards or have the patients in an outer circle listening to the discussion of that… that's… that’s often very highly engaging and stimulating for patients. 

00:09:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So you are willing to treat your patients as colleague. 

00:09:05
IRVIN YALOM That’s right, I think it’s important to de… to demystify therapy and to I think, therapy is… is powerful now as it is without a needing to add… add something that deliberately mystifies and I think the… the more that we know the less necessary just to do that back in the 19th century of course we always wrote our prescriptions in Latin and kept the patient ignorant of… of many of our things that we were doing almost as a… as a way of… of concealing our ignorance. 

00:09:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Let me come back to the issue of counter transference or… or dealing with the… the therapist own psychological baggage you've… you've described an interesting case in Love's Executioner of a woman who came to you, who was obese and wanted to lose weight and you pointed out that you yourself had a… a very marked pronounced prejudice against fat women, and yet you took on the case, wonderfully you could tell me what some of your motivation was there. 

00:10:05
IRVIN YALOM Well that was… that’s a story called the fat lady, and I have been excoriated for that story ever since the book was published really of all the parts of that book, that’s the one that's had the most… the most attention but, it is a story of a… of a woman not just an obese woman, this is the woman who is very… very morbidly obese extremely heavy and it is true that I… that I did have some negative feeling about the… about in a sense people women who… who look like that and so, I started off being aware of that kind of negative set that I had towards the patient and in fact the story is a story of a… of a gradual transformation not only the patient but, in my own attitude so that as therapy progressed I was able to allow her to in my own eyes who a sort of re-humanize herself to be able to… to see her in the struggling person underneath… underneath the weight and so it’s a… it is I… I meant the story to be a kind of a… a parallel story not only of her struggles but of… of my struggles as well. 

00:11:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE As most of your stories are this way. 

00:11:20
IRVIN YALOM That’s right yeah and I think hers is… is perhaps the most… the most marked one, dramatic one in that way. 

00:11:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Other therapist would say, if you knew you had a prejudice against this type of a person you should not have taken the case. 

00:11:30
IRVIN YALOM Well, yes and other, other therapist have said that, but I… I just have a… a great doubt whether therapist who don’t have any of those feelings really exist that… that you know I think that we all have various feelings and… and attitudes towards people that we have to find ways of… of working through and if we work it through with this particular patient who you know in a… in a sense I was, a spokesmen from much of our culture with this particular patient because the kind of prejudice that… that she may have encountered in me was it is very… very omnipresent in culture at large, so what better way perhaps to reproduce the kind of cultural struggles into… to bring it into this very… into this very room and the fact that I had these feelings about her I think was a way of treating her more humanly they not to tap into feelings which may have been there, but I wasn't… wouldn’t be willing to… to work with. 

00:12:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I get the sense in the virtually all of the cases you written about that the early sessions are once in which your own barriers come up and their barriers are up as well in… in you don’t see each other in a heart, to heart kind of fashion you… you see each other in terms of your images were stereotypes and then as you get to know each other these breakdown and… and… and something real happens two very different people emerge. 

00:12:50
IRVIN YALOM That’s right, yeah at the all of the stories in… in… in the book Love’s Executioner I do think start that way it goes without saying of course that… that have… than a lot of… of conversation or a taken a… a patient say, a year of therapy and a sort of sudden if we just sort of framed and mated this way and look at this part there is a good story in there, so written about that without including much of the everyday bread and butter work that goes on in therapy which… which really don’t make for a good dramatic story. 

00:13:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right, when you written a bestseller and it… it takes some doing, I suppose to translate real psychotherapy into good literature. 

00:13:30
IRVIN YALOM So, I've… I've you know try to be as faithful as I could to psychotherapy and it will be the same time wanting to have something that was… that was dramatically exciting and… and creative so… so, there is… there is been a compromise in there, yes there is some fiction obviously many of these cases were treated years ago, the dialogue of course is… is… is absolutely fictional. 

00:13:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE One of the issues you talk about, is your own I guess the best word would be hubris, you know the idea that you have in many therapist have, I have certainly experienced it myself a sort of like I can treat anybody I just have to kind of be myself with them and it's all going to work out no matter what mistakes I make. 

00:14:10
IRVIN YALOM Yes, that’s right, and then sometimes you come against the hard facts that some people are extremely difficult to work with and… and the fact that they have worked with many other therapists tells you something that… that, that the chances are that… that you are going to be another therapist who can succeed with them. So in one of the stories the… the title story of that… the story called Love’s Executioner and that was this exactly the case where I… I began to be a little grandiose and I began to dismiss the fact that she had you should work with many therapist by reminding myself that these were all student therapists and that I had a very good idea about what I thought was behind a lot of her symptoms and in the long run was brought up short I think for some of the hubris that I had. 

00:14:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In your few radical perspective in psychotherapy, I say it be fair to calling you an existential therapist. 

00:15:05
IRVIN YALOM I'm always little uncomfortable with that title because it… it… it does suggested that there is a… a structured body of thought that really governs the… the choices that I make in therapy from the very beginning on way that… that I don’t think is the case and that’s… that's why its very, you to… you don’t see institutes of existential therapy because its… it's not so much a separate doctor as… as it is in extension therapy that there are… you are willing to look at… at certain issues, but all these I think have to be superimposed on them you know a good solid traditional approach to psychotherapy. 

00:15:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But it sounds like, as I read your work one of your premises is that underneath the symptoms are existential issues, people afraid of dealing with aging and death and alienation, loneliness these sorts of things and the symptoms often just distract us from the real existential issues. 

00:16:00
IRVIN YALOM Yeah, absolutely I'm… I feel that, I feel that, very strongly and it has to do of course with the what… what once explanatory system is about the sources of anxiety so that, as… as you are saying quiet frequently I think, underlying the… the symptoms the initial promise that people bring into just to… to therapy that there are sources of anxiety which may come from these existential issues from the issues that we all have to face in our lives that have to do simply with our very being in these… these are… are the idea that were… that were all finite that all of us have to face that, and that… and that this… this stimulates tremendous amount of anxiety for all of us that something we work on… work through… through all our lives and other issues having to do with existence including isolation and freedom or the lack of structure really that exist in their… in our lives and in reality as… as well as there sort of endless search for a… for meaning in life. I think all of these are important sorts of anxiety that often are overlooked in more traditional approaches of therapy but, sometimes the… the… there are other kinds of issues that generate anxiety having to do with a… having to do with relationships, having to do with sexuality so… so I don’t want to look at these at the patient in an exclusive… exclusive manner that's why say it’s a… it’s a posture it’s an accent in therapy. 

00:17:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE One of the directions that I think that this seems to lead you in… in to is to look at present day issues pretty much rather than it exploring a lot of childhood issues. 

00:17:45
IRVIN YALOM That’s right, I… I… I do feel that it… it is much more important to look at the here in now that’s… that's for both individual and… and in group therapy sometimes it is very important to… to get an idea of the patient sense of… of development, but very frequently I feel that… that patients and therapists may spend countless hours rampaging through the past not that the time is wasted, I think it… it may be very valuable time, but its valuable not for the content or what’s on earth, but its valuable because the therapist and the patient both value this particular task, so it… it acts as a glue a cement to keep them bound together for what really will ultimately be that the… the… the healing aspect of psychotherapy, and that is the relationship between the two. 

00:18:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That’s important. 

00:18:40
IRVIN YALOM That’s always important, yeah. 

00:18:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That the… that’s where you see change coming right out of the relationship. 

00:18:45
IRVIN YALOM I… I… I do that, and I focus very much, very heavily on a relationship with every single patient that I… that I work with in fact I hardly like to have an hour go by within with the patient without at some point turning the attention back to taking a look at the… the process that’s going on, between… between the two of us. In fact it’s… it's almost automatic for me that at some point during the session sometimes even it may be just be the last few minutes of the session that I will… that I will stop and then say, lets can we take a little bit if you look for a few minutes about how you feel that we have been working together today what were special issues about our relationship about me that pass through your mind, but most of my patients are… are so used to this happening that it comes up fairly automatically. 

00:19:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And I am under the impression that many therapists would be quiet threatened by this they don't want to know. 

00:19:45
IRVIN YALOM Sometimes that… that… that happens, but if you… you know its almost like with any other kind of particular approach in therapy if you deal with this long enough then all the possible untoward kinds of crisis have already occurred in your practice that your… your… your kind of use… your kind of use to that I'm… I'm thinking of you know patient that I saw this afternoon and it was difficult for her to speak during the session I have seen her only for about three or four months and she had a strong sense of… of that she was going to somehow fail that she… she was an therapist and she had read some books I had written so she was quiet intimidated by me and she knew that, I wanted to work in here and now but, she just felt, she didn’t know how to do that. So, we spent some time looking that and then we talk some more about her intimidation by me of me she felt that I would somehow judge her negatively we looked at what her data was for that, we looked at some for her experiences that have occurred with other… with other teachers or professors, we looked at her wishes that I would care for her, we looked even at her concerns that she would possible become attached to me and then also know that I would be leaving after a period of time. So you know and somehow after this, things became much more real between the two of us. So, as I say hardly an hour goes by without my somehow looking it was going on between me and the patient. 

00:21:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE What is it actually about the relationship that you think causes the healing and I think when we say healing you are talking about alleviative symptoms. 

00:21:25
IRVIN YALOM I am talking about alleviative symptoms, but I'm also talking about something else, I am also talking about their ability to relate closely to one and another and I mean I think, so many of our patients may come in with this symptom or that symptom or insomnia or phobia or something like that, but… but underlying so much of this are some problems that… that really stem from the inability to get gratification from their relationship with someone close so that, if I can really work with the patient and we are intimately relating to one another then they began to see for one thing that this can be… this can generalize the relationships outside, but they begin to see that here is someone that knows everything about them and likes respects them, deals with them, understands and they can be understood, they can be liked you know I think there is so many messages that you give to patient about the core sense of self that they have through your own… through your own person and in the group of course it's through the relationship they have with… with so many different people. I do the same thing in the group precisely and that I… I… I quiet explicit to the patient that our tasks in this group is to help each of you understand as much as you can about what goes on between you and each of the other people here in the group and we don’t need a lot of history we don’t need for a detailed accounts of what happens with you in the past or what happened with you in the past or what happens with you with other people because that data will unroll right here in front of us and that’s much more accurate data than any kind of history that they will give you. 

00:23:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I get the impression and though that, this approach is a sort of lying in the face of the dominant social trend towards the medical model in psychotherapy and the emphasis on brief psychotherapy treat the symptom, get the patient in and out in eight to twelve sessions and these deeper philosophical issues are considered sort of a luxury in given THE economic realities. 

00:23:30
IRVIN YALOM That, they certainly are and its of course the… the economic realities, the third party pairs that are… are dominating the way, that psychiatry frames, the symptoms frames the patient. None of that however has the slightest bit to do with what the truth of the psychotherapeutic venture is. These are just changes in fads and fashions and… and… and economics and I think its… its a great pity and I… I worry a great deal about what will happen to psychotherapy in the future. Not only in terms of how psychiatry have used the venture but… but where the next generation of… of therapists will come from where they have been trained. Certainly not in psychiatric residencies nor in many schools of… clinical schools and psychology as well. What the emphasis on behavioral and cognitive modes. 

00:24:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Alright. Let me focus again, with you, maybe we can take a cut deeper into the question of what is that the causes the healing I… I get a sense from reading your works that there is something almost intangible may be, a sense of presence or a sense of depth that results in the relationship that its… it's not just that you are having a… a real relationship with you they may have had other real relationships in their life. 

00:24:50
IRVIN YALOM You know, well you know so many of the patients that I have worked with in a… in a sense of had real relationships, but they have often been failed relationships in some important way rather they, they've never been a… a completely known by another person never completely reveal themselves never felt they have been completely understood, so many of the patients feel that they have been fraudulent in their relationships that they block their way through life both professionally as… as well as socially. So, you know I do think that the… the therapeutic relationship is… is one in which there is the deepest possible sense of being known in once entirety by another person its… it's hard to know of other ways to put that or how you might actually label a phrase the kind of acceptance or understanding that goes on between the patient and therapist and people talk about the therapist being a… a possibly tutor(ph) helping the patient unfold in… in someway through that certainly Rogers has talked about that… that idea the patient are unfolding in the light of this… this full acceptance. 

00:26:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm I… I get the sense from your writings that when the therapy is really working well, a person is able to get in touch with the… the deepest fears the terrors and… and they find that you accept that in them. 

00:26:15
IRVIN YALOM That's right. 

00:26:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE They may even discover that you've got some of the same fears. 

00:26:20
IRVIN YALOM That’s right, in… in… in a sense that… that’s a… that's one place where the… where the existential accent I think is important that you begin to convey to the patient that there is… there is nothing that you are not willing to look at or to accept or to go into, you know sometimes that is particularly evident in a patient is facing some threat to… to his or her own life and working with patients who may be terribly ill for example, there is this of a sense of… of isolation of not being able to talk about ones… ones deepest fears, one talks about ones fears of dying that will frighten another people or drive with them away but I think a therapist who is accustomed and… and willing is… is able to just plunge into the middle of that with patients and for once patients can feel it or need to protect the other, shield the other, run the risk of being rejected. 

00:27:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Dr. Irvin Yalom we are out of time now. 

00:27:20
IRVIN YALOM Oh really, okay. 

00:27:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's been a pleasure being with you and sharing with you this sense of your willingness to enter into frightening even dangerous territory with… with your patients. Thanks so much for being with me. 

00:27:30
IRVIN YALOM Very welcome. 

00:27:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And thank you for being with us.
