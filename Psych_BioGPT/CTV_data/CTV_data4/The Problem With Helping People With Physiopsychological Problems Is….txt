The Problem with Helping People with Physiopsychological Problems is....Helen Erickson, Ph.D., RN, AHN-BC, FAAN 

00:00:15
HELEN ERICKSON I first met my father-in-law in 1956, when I was still a little backhills, backcountry Michigan nurse that knew very little about very much. And at that point in time, I only knew that he was the father of my fiance, so it was- it was quite a surprise when I discovered that he was this famous man who was displayed in the middle of the Life magazine. So you can't imagine what an experience I had, because I was at one of the early Ash conferences, where Dad presented in Detroit, 1956. So that's where my be- my experience began. And I can't tell you how excited I am to be here and share with you some of the things that I learned from him, through these years, as I've, um, proceeded. Now I was told by somebody that I had to do this, so here it is. The two things that you're supposed to get from this conference, or this particular presentation, is- two Ericksonian concepts, essential when working with people who have physiopsychological problems, and that you will be able to state by the end of this time that modeling really means to step into someone's world. It's a strategy that Dad taught me. Taught everyone that he encountered, how to do it and how to think like that. But for me, he used the language 'modeling', so modeling means to model someone else's world and understand it from their perspective so you can facilitate their growth, their being- their well-being. So, I suspect that some of you are a little excited about being here, and a little eager maybe to experience something that's going to put the dazzle back in your practice. Some of you probably lost that dazzle and you're hoping that you'll get something here. Some of you may be a little bit tired. Some of you may be wondering how you're going to pack anything more in. You've already had a full day. I like to think of these conferences myself as an opportunity to let go of some of the stuff that I don't need any longer, make room for that which will help me grow, and to become more of who I have the capability of being, and I hope the same for you. So there's always room. I know, and I know you know, that there's a beginning for all things. Yet, interestingly, there is always a time before the beginning. And, there will be a time after the now. Sometimes it's hard to know, are we in the beginning, or are we reliving the past, or are we already creating the future? These are important things for us to wonder about. For just as there is a blooming of the now, there is a past. And there is also a future. And each of us has to know where we are in that process. Sometimes when I stop to ponder these questions I think about how the past and the present and the future all interface, I am amazed at what we encounter as we go along in our life journey. What we encounter but we put aside, because we don't need it any longer. We're too old for that, we're too grown-up for that. And sometimes we do that at the expense of what will happen to us or with us in the future. So we forget to remember. We fail to use the information that's embedded in our memory. Information that might be important to us as we create our future. Meaningful future. And most curious of all, we often forget how we learned. Now, this business of putting the past behind us and p- and forgetting about it, is so much a part of who we are as human beings that we ce- celebrate it. We tell our children, You're old enough now that you can do this or that. We clap and cheer when they're able to walk instead of crawl. We celebrate each birthday, we celebrate graduations, we celebrate the growing up. The celebrations that are symbolic imply that we are older and we can do new things. So we are encouraged to put aside that which was our past and sometimes we are even punished when we don't. Yet to me, it's very interesting to remember that once we all had to learn how to breathe, how to sit up, how to crawl, how to walk, how to hang on and how to let go, and it is interesting. It is very interesting to remember that there was a time that we were aware of our natural ability to do what comes naturally. A time when we expected ourselves to grow, to grow where growth is needed, not not needed, and to heal when healing is needed. And there was a time when we new without question, we knew this without question, that we as human beings are more than a body, more than a constellation of parts, that just work together. We knew that we had this ability to heal, to grow, and to fulfill our life purpose. To understand our reason for being. These are the natural forces of life, that we encounter, and use on our journey. Yet we put them away and we forget them. They're there, they're waiting for us, they're ready for us. All we have to do is ignite the spark. So what I want to do this afternoon is to share with you how I've helped people recapture their spark, to find their true selves, and how to let go of that which isn't. These are all lessons I've learned from Milton Erickson. But first, Jeff, I want to speak to you. Okay? As I prepared for this presentation, Jeff, I thought of you, and how many people you've helped, all over this world. You know, you were not very old when you first met Dad. And unfortunately you didn't have very much time to be with him. But you certainly learned, and you learned fast. You're very smart, obviously, and you learn fast, and you took his work into a new century. That is a remarkable thing to do, Jeff.

HELEN ERICKSON I know that Dad and Mom would both be very very proud of you, Jeff. I know, I know that. I know Mom was, and I know they were grateful. And I, on behalf of the Erickson family that's here, we applaud you, we thank you, and we commend you. So thank you, Jeff.

HELEN ERICKSON And one more thing. It's not just on behalf of the Erickson clan. I'm saying this on behalf of the thousands of people that you have impacted all over the world, Jeff. You have- you were the mentee back in the 70s and now you're the mentor. And there are people all over this world who have changed and are evolving because of you. I applaud you because I think you are a transformer. And not only have you changed psychotherapy, you have transformed health care. So if I could have anything to say today, it would be let's stop using the language psychotherapy, and let's talk about the broader perspective, because I'm a nurse. And there are doctors out in this audience who care to take this i- these ideas, and treat and deal with the whole. So I love you, Jeff, and I thank you very much. Well, no more procrastination. Now I have to talk to you about what I'm supposed to be talking to you about. And I hope you know that there's no notes needed to be taken, and you don't have to worry about anything. I don't care if you take a nap, that's perfectly fine with me, because I know at some level you'll be thinking and hearing what I say. So just sit back and relax and enjoy the ride. You'll remember what's relevant, and what isn't you can leave right behind. I'm not going to spend a lot of time, in fact I'm not going to spend any time talking about strategies and interventions. I could do that. I used to give workshops with Sandy Sylvester at the National Institute for Clinical Behavioral, whatever that group is, Nicombomb(ph) I called them. Anyway, we taught hypnosis. But I don't, I don't think that's what you need from me. There are lots and lots of people here that will talk v- very elegantly about that. What I want to talk about instead is this thing called modeling and role-modeling, which Jeff alluded to before. That language was coined by my father-in-law, Milton Erickson, and I don't know if anybody else in this room ever heard that word from him, but I think if not, that's because he was a master of stepping into someone else's world, and understanding from their perspective. Now I think he gave me that language when he got reallt frustrated with me one day because- now, remember I started in the 50s, and this was probably in the 70s, and I had already started doing research, and I had private practice, and done a number of things, but still I keep going back and I'd say, Okay now, Dad, you know, what about this, or what about that? I wanted him to tell me what to do. What to do. No, she says, it's not about what to do. Well anyway, I wanted that to be told, and Dad would always kind of look at me with that look, and he'd ask a question, and I think he was just testing, did I know enough to know what I was talking about. And then he'd simply tell me a story. But then one day, after he, uh, had explained in great detail to me in about three different ways, as Milton Erickson was very good at using- telling the same thing in multiple ways, he told me that I needed to learn how to observe people's behaviors and understand what I observed. One thing. And then he said I needed to treat each individual being individually. Well, we've all heard that, haven't we? And that didn't make any sense to me because I'd heard it a hundred times, and I'd read it 50 times or more. But then what he said was, "You need to model their world, cookie." And I think I had probably been using language comparable to that, because that's what he did. He'd step into a person's world and he'd use their language. But he said "You have to model their world," and instantly I knew what he meant. You have understand their perspectives from where they are. It was as though a lightbulb went off, and then he added on that people want to live the roles that are meaningful to them. And so not only do you model their world to understand who they are and what's important to them, and what's interfering with their health and growth, but you listen for the roles that they're interested in, and you- your interventions are all focused on facilitating them to live those roles. And when you start thinking like that it's so simple, it's really simple because it pares it down to simple kinds of ideas. I don't think he really thought I knew all I need to knew just- know just yet, because at that meeting, at that time we were there, he sent Mom out to get me a book called 'Nightmare Alley'. And it's just a book. You don't have to run out and get 'Nightmare Alley', you can do this with any of them, but he told me, he said, "Now cookie, you read the first chapter and then the next chapter, and so forth. And each chapter, you stop at the end of the chapter and you predict what's going to happen and then you figure out where you made the mistake. And as you go through the whole book you do that, and I thought I was so cool when I got all done, I came back and you know, reported to him that I'd done this, and I'd figured out where I'd made mi- my mistakes and why and so forth, and he said, "Go get another book, cookie, and read it backwards, and do the same thing." Never ever ever since that experience has my life been the same. Because once you do that, you know there's a past that affects the present, and will create the future. So, I had been using these techniques, modeling and role-modeling, written a book. There's a society called The Advancement of the Modeling and Role-Modeling, and it's based on some basic premises. What I want to talk about and tell you about is some of the things, experiences I had, and some of the things I learned through that process. I've been using these strategies for a number of years, and by the mid-80s I had this private practice that I was running, and I had, uh, I was teaching at the University of Michigan and completed two research studies, and I was now very very much involved in the third NIH study, which is this, this particular one, modeling and role-modeling. Helping people who have diabetes cope with their daily events. And you notice not- no emphasis on the diabetes, the emphasis is on the people. Which is kind of unusual when you're around large medical centers. Medical centers and researchers on the diabetes or the hypertension or the this or the that, but it's not on the people. My emphasis is always on the- the people. As you can see. So a basic premise of modeling and role-modeling is that people are holistic. Their minds, bodies are interactive in such a way that there's no beginning and there's no end. Now, there's nobody that can talk about this like Ernie Rossi. And he's- he's talked about it for years, and he's going to talk about it some more this afternoon. And he's impacted me greatly, so thank you, Ernie. I think you were one of the early people that said what I argued at the time just because I believed it in my heart to be true, and that was that there was a linkage between mind/body relationships and DNA. And at the opening of the DNA gateways. And now the research shows that. How exciting, that that's true, that we found that. So these are very important aspects of what I do. Believing that stressors start in any part of the person and can affect another part of the person, so- in such a way that there's a cascading of neurochemistries and so forth, so that time may, a stressor produces stress response, and that stress response produces another and so forth, and you don't know where one begins and where another ends. But another aspect of this holistic model that is important to me, and Dad never said this, and I have no idea what he'd say to me today, but I would think he's- I think he would say, You're fine, cookie. And that is that arrow that runs through the whole thing. I believe that there is a spiritual drive, and I'm not talking about religion, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about a human force that comes from the universe and it goes back to the universe, and that's what makes us human. And that's one of the key things that I think Milton Erickson did that people- Over, and over. I think he helped people find their self. Some people call it their spiritual self, you can call it whatever you want, but I think he helped people find their self, their inner being. That which gives meaning and purpose to our lives. So my job is to help them find their way on these journeys that people have. So I was in the midst of this research study working with people who have diabetes, and I'd put out a call for subjects, and received a notice from my administrative assistant that someone was showing up that afternoon for a meeting. When he arrived, I invited him in to join me in my office, to find a seat that was comfortable, asked him to tell me a little bit about himself, and his situation, and he stated that he had diabetes, that it interfered with his life, he was only 36, he was a full professor. This was at the University of Michigan. That is unheard of at the University of Michigan. He had a lot of work to do but he couldn't get around to do it because of this mess he was in. He couldn't do anything, and if this continued, he was concerned that he might die, or he might just fade away. I asked him to estimate how likely that was to happen, and using his words, 'mess', 'die', or 'fade away', he said he didn't know, but he was afraid that it was a very good possibility. Reflected that it must be very scary to think of fading away. Then commented that he was very young, was very accomplished, and so I guess I could say that he was also very smart. And he was obviously a fast learner. After all, he was only 36 and he was a full professor, so perhaps what we needed to do, he and I, was to focus on finding new things and new ways to learn, so that he didn't need to fade away. But, instead he might blossom and grow. And then I suggested that he might find something to hang onto that would help him. I asked him if that would be useful and he said Yeah. He looked at me and he thought maybe he could try that. That he was smart. And I told him, Yes, he was, he knew what he needed, and that he had come for help, and he was a fast learner. I also commented that he might be curious about how he was going to discover what else was interfering with his natural ability to be what he wanted to be, to do what he wanted to do, and to be able to let go. Observing his response and then ask him what his 'mess' meant to him, without hesitation, he told me. It means getting back into my crazy family, and without hesitation he spilled the beans. He told me he had a crazy mother, he was the oldest of four, he had an absent father, ran away when mother was very young, he was frantic to get away from that mess. He was the oldest of the four kids and he was responsible for everybody. Mother was schizophrenic. He had a girlfriend in high school, he was smart- Sorry. Can't hear? Is that better? All right. He was the oldest of four, I told you that, he was responsible for his family, and he was frantic to get away from the mess that he was in. He had a high school girlfriend, who mothered him, took care of him. They got married because she was pregnant. They had five kids. Now he'd learned when he was just a kid, just an adolescent, that his worth was tied up with academic learning, so he learned and he learned and he achieved and he achieved and he became a full professor at the University of Michigan. And his wife left. And she left six months before he developed diabetes. He developed diabetes six months after she left. He still told me that he was abandoned by her. He told me all of this in probably 15 or 20 minutes because people tell you everything you need to hear when you connect with them. And you stay connected with them. You just have to know how to listen to what they're saying. I talked to him a little bit about how scary this must be, and maybe he felt a little helpless or maybe even a little hopeless, but that he didn't know something that I knew, and what I knew was about human potential to heal and to grow under the right circumstances. And that he was in a very messy situation, and that he and I together could figure out what to do about this. I talked to him a little bit about how people know what they need, and that they can grow but they get stuck. And he's stuck, stuck in a big mess, and fortunately I'm a mess cleaner. So our job is to help him find new ways to do old things. I talked to him about needs, and how all human beings have needs, and those needs drive our behavior and I talked to him about how those needs, when they're met, they're met by objects or things that are very important to us. And when we lose those objects or those things that are very important to us, we experience loss. And we were unable to resolve our loss, we go into a grieving state. And how important it is for us to understand all of these aspects. Well, what happened over the next few weeks- Let me just tell you first about what happened at the end of that session. At the end of that first session he commented that he felt better, but he was afraid that he would lose what we'd done, that he'd start fading away again. So I said that I knew that, and I offered him a business card. I bet there's not a person in here, in this room, that hasn't offered business cards. I wonder, do you anchor feeling? Do you anchor them? And if you don't, I'd invite you to try that. Because I always anchor my business cards. And what I do with them is I offer the business card and I say, Now, this is a business card, and this is a way- Some people traditionally use these for phone numbers and so forth but what I want you to do with it, is I want you to hold it in your hand, and to remember what we talked about, how you felt when you were with me, and use it. This is called a transitional object, it's pretty- you know, it's very obvious. Transitional objects are extremely important. So I gave him a business card at the end of that meeting. And, he took it home, put it in his breast pocket, took it home. His, uh, homework assignment was to practice using his business card. And I reminded him how it felt to be affiliated and connected, and also to have that giddy up and go. I think you all know about the giddy up and go, Milton Erickson's giddy up and go. You don't need to tell a horse where to go, it knows how to get there. If you don't know that story, look it up, because it's a wonderful story and I use it all the time with my clients. I don't need to tell you where to go, you know. You have a natural giddy up and go. What I need to do is help you get on that horse, and do it. So I told him about that too. Now using transitional objects was key in this, in this, working with this case, and it has been, almost- I would say, almost all of my clients, because almost all of them I work with have had the same kind of problem that this particular individual has. Not all of them. And I'll tell you about some of those in a little bit. Over the next few weeks we worked maybe 15 to 30 minutes, I don't have hour sessions, I'm a nurse, I don't have time for hour sessions. I work 15 to 30 minutes, maybe one to two times a week. We'd meet in different strange places, sometimes we'd be in the cafeteria, sometimes it'd be in, uh, the outpatient, sometimes we'd be in my office, and over and over what we did was the same kind of thing. Now you may have noticed in my first session with him, that I used strategies that are typical of developing trust as Eric Erickson talks about it. My work is very deeply based in developmental phenomena, starting at the beginning, or maybe even before the beginning. Thinking that the first stage of life is about learning to trust someone else to be there for you and to be affiliated so that you can be not only affiliated but you can be individualated. All at the same time. So, we worked on trust, and the way you work on trust- how do you do it with a one-year old? How do you do it with an infant? Soft voice tones, concrete language, affirmations, not expecting anything, but giving. Giving of yourself, and staying connected. It didn't take very long before he moved out of the stage of trust and he started working on the next stage, which is autonomy, and working on autonomy means you have to reframe and rebuild the shame and doubt that's there, out of that second stage of life, and help people grow and make decisions that are good decisions for them. Healthy decisions for them. So we did that, and then what happens with everyone is they have a natural giddy up and go, so they go. They go into the next stage of life, which is they start taking initiative, and my job is very different during that period of time. It's to ensure that the initiative that they're taking is healthy things that they're doing for themselves. I have never ever recommended that people exercise or diet, I don't do that. If people ask me, should they diet? I ask them to tell me about it. Why would they want to do that? I don't care if they are 500 pounds. Why would they want to do it? And then we talk about dieting in a way that's healthy and respectful to them. So, over the, over the time, what I did with him was simply communicate with him. Remember what Paul Vaslovich says, is you cannot not communicate. You cannot not communicate. If the other person perceives that you're communicating with them, you are. And if they think that you're attending or you're not attending, you are. It's all within your context. We cannot not communicate. So my focus during these first interactions with him was to replace the mistrust with healthy trust, to replace the shame and doubt with good autonomy, to replace the guilt with initiative. And thereafter people take off on their own. They don't need me. And I have had many many many health care providers who have come to me through the years and said, Oh, don't they get too dependent on you? No, because I believe in their giddy up and go. I know that people will grow, if you help them. You have to stay connected to them to do it though. Those of you who worked with Milton Erickson still feel like he's a part of you. He's still connected to you. He never disconnected from people, when he was working with them. He didn't do that. So, as this man grew, his homework assignments changed, of course, depending on the stage he was working on, and he learned that he could be, uh, healthy and not have to be sick to get his needs me. He learned how to be affiliated at the same time he could be individuated. He learned so many things. I'll just back up here, just a second. The last time that I talked to him- and I receive cards from him almost every Christmas for years, probably 15 years. This was in '75 when I worked with this man, so, you know, long time ago. Um, I receive cards from him every year and he told me all the things he was doing, and he was working full time, and writing, and doing his research. He was off his insulin, uh, he was doing just fine. Had reconnected with his family. They hadn't- His wife and he were good friends now, and they both found other partners, which was an appropriate thing from them to do. And he was doing just fine, and what he said to me was, "You know that business card that you gave me? Still have it." 15 years. And I laughed and said, "You know, the phone number's not so good anymore." He said, "No, but you know, at one point in time it kept me from fading away, and now it's just my lucky charm." And then he laughed, and he said, "You know, that's silly, isn't it? I couldn't have possibly faded away. I'm 6'2" and 220 pounds." And I simply said to him, "You know, it's very interesting how our perce- our perspectives change." At one time he knew he could fade away, and I knew he could too. And I've seen enough people die under those kinds of circumstances to know that that can happen. So I don't, I don't not pay attention. Now, through the years I've worked with lots of people, lots of researches, studies and so forth, and I've written about it. And one of them I wrote about that was in this particular publication, one of Jeff and uh, Steven Gilligan's 'Brief Therapy', about a case that had hypertension and same kind of thing. We worked with him- I worked with him for a number of weeks, about the same 10, 15 minutes, maybe once or twice a week, and his case was fascinating because he too was stuck and needed help. But the thing that's probably most important for him, for me to share with you about him was that after he and I discontinued seeing one another, he contacted me and sent me a book, with a letter stating that, um, this picture that you see here was going to be put in the University of Michigan's library, in the museum. And in the library, that picture hangs. And underneath of it is his name and mine, and it is dedicated to me, and it's a picture of Radha showing Krishna his reflection in the mirror. His letter stated that this represented what I'd done for him. I'd helped him see him self. Not himself, but him self. So, I- I was quite taken by that, that this man had that kind of insight and understanding. Received letters from him for years and years, and, uh, retired, received a letter from him when he retired from university. Many of these people keep in touch by sending letters, just to let me know that they're okay. Well I could tell you about lots of cases like these but I know you're getting hungry and time's moving along, so I'll- I just want to raise a few questions and issues for you to think about. I listed this presentation as working with people with psychophysiological problems, but I raised- asked you to think, is it physio-psycho? Psycho-physico? Or should we be talking holistic? Should we be talking about the whole person, and stop this fragmenting people? It's my sense that we should, we should stop fragmenting our thinking. Because we are holistic beings. And we have multiple natural forces that we come with, that we can help people tap. When a client says he's sick because his dog died, I agree. I know the virus causes the flu, but I agree, you can get sick because your dog dies. Because it compromises your immune system and on and on. So let's talk about the holistic. And let's not forget the epigenetic model of development. Now an epigenetic model of development is extremely important in my work, and it comes from Eric Erickson, and it really means that we go across a lifespan, working in stages at chronologically appropriate times, but each time we have to go back and rework the earlier stages. And as we rework them, or as we work them originally and then rework them we carry residuals with us. That's what carry the trust, or the mistrust. That's what carry the shame and doubt, etcetera. I think this is one of the biggest problems with the health care providers have, and I'm going to get to that in just a minute. The notion being, then, is that we have to remember to start where the person is. If the person is dealing with mistrust, and believe me, our health care system is designed so that people have mistrust in health care providers. And so they come to you, they come to me, with a chip on their shoulder, telling us a piece of the picture, holding back and resisting because they don't trust that we really care about them. This is a serious problem. And I don't think we'll solve this problem until we- until we start thinking about people as holistic beings. Okay. So I've learned to go back and work on trust first- trust, and then autonomy. I- I used to do quite bit of teaching at the univ- I've taught at the University of Michigan, University of Texas, University of South Carolina. Particularly at Michigan I had a number of students, and then South Carolina, and I see some of my college students here. Uh, that I would teach them and they would say- Well I'd sit down and I said to them, uh, Tell me what's going on and let's see if we can figure out what to do, and that person would say something and then they'd say, And I gave them this really good book to read, and they threw it back at me. Anybody in here ever had that experience? If you've said, Go read a book, go find this, you're treating people as though they have enough trust and autonomy to do that. So I found that you have to start earlier, and it doesn't take a lot of time, it doesn't take- I'm a nurse! Nurses don't have time. Okay. I can't say that too much. You have to start with trust and then autonomy. You have to pay attention to these- this language that people use. The notion that abandonment- of abandonment- I, I'm sure you all know this, but I think maybe some of you forgot so I'm going to tell you again. Abandonment comes out of trust. Rejection comes out of autonomy. If you have people talking about abandonment, they had issues in the first nine months of their life. If you hear people talking about rejection it comes up two- like after that, that's the next stage. Those are very different interventions that there- they need. A second book that I wrote really addresses some of that. Because people don't seem to understand that when you're working with somebody who's in the- in the process of learning how to trust someone, that's about knowing that human being will be there for you. That's not about doing anything for yourself, it's about knowing somebody that will be there for you. The stage of autonomy's about making decisions, and having somebody affirm your decisions and guide you and help you figure out, are those decisions good decisions? Those are different kinds of phenomena, they require different kinds of interventions. Abandonment, trust, rejection, autonomy. Okay. Now that's a sandwiching thing that's up here. The other thing that I've seen over and over and over is that people will throw out one word, they'll give you a whole bunch of garbage on this end and a whole bunch of garbage on that end and right in the middle is the meat of the issue. And health care providers miss it because they're paying too much attention to the bread, okay? Forget the bread, look for the meat. Don't let them get you distracted. Pay attention to what's in the core. And usually it's one to four words, it's not a big long phrase and it's not a big exclamation. It's fast, it's furious, it's there, and it's covered up. It's almost like they dig and they uncover it and then they cover it up again. Real fast. You have to pay attention. I call that sandwiching. Pay attention to the meat in the sandwich, because that's the clue. And don't say anything about it at the time that you're working and listening to them. You go back to it, I noticed you said. Okay. So what else? This whole business of loss and morbid grief. Everybody that I have worked with has had morbid grief, and I could tell you, could stand up here and tell you story after story after story, what kind of behavior do you see in morbid grief. Jar Jangle(ph) did the research years ago and told us, you see fluctuations back and forth between depre- depressions and manic behavior. Or some kind of variation of that. Those are people who have morbid grief. Our job is to help them uncover the loss, so you just begin to listen, and you can understand what kind of loss it is. Is it in trust, is it in aut- autonomy, and so forth. And finally the, uh, the next thing is this whole idea of being connected and individuated at the same time. These are very important ideas. Why is this important to you? Those of you in this country, health care reform is a fact. They think it's going to get repealed and maybe parts of it will, but health care reform is a fact, and we are moving now into a time where the whole f- the whole premise is going to be health promotion, is going to be wellness, it is going to be disease prevention, and we need to learn how to think like this. We need to learn how to facilitate health and wellness and disease prevention by just paying attention to some of these things. More important, and I mentioned this to Jeff, and I noticed there is someone here in this group that is a health coach. Health coach is going to be something you're all going to hear about over the next five years. It's coming, it's in Europe already. It's, yeah. Big studies have been done in Europe already, and it's coming to the United States. It's being funded. It's going to be started in Medicare and Medicaid and what is it about? It's doing exactly what I just got done talking about. It's helping people identify what they need and move on with that and find ways. We need to focus on this so that we can be the leaders. So, I recently talked with one of the big pushers in this country, she's a young woman in Harvard, and she said that 50% of the time, health coach- coaching, the research shows that 50% of the time health coaching doesn't work. And I said, let me tell you why. That's because that 50% where it doesn't they choose people like, not from a trust perspective, not from an autonomy perspective, but like, I'm the teller, you're the listener. Not Ericksonian stuff. So you need that for that reason. Another reason is the returning veterans. We all know what's happening all over the United States is we're returning veterans from and eight to 10 year experience and we're going to have to deal with PTSD, which is morbid grief. And I have lots of veterans' stories I could share with you but my time is running out. So these are a couple of the reasons that you need to have a frame of reference. If you don't now, I would say that this is one of the things that Milton Erickson did for me. He said the same thing, Jeff, I was astounded when you said what Dad had said in that letter. Because he said not the same words but the same thing. Don't pay attention to the gimmickry. That's the language I put on it, don't pay attention to how you put somebody in trance, don't pay attention to that because people go into trance on their own. Pay attention to the human being and how you connect and how you communicate. That's what's important. So I learned all the indirect suggestions and all the imbedded commands and I use all of that in my work with people because it's extremely important. But that's not what Milton Erickson was about from my perspective. If you watch his video tapes, it was about the relationship. If you watch him, he was the most amazing man i ever saw in my whole life and how he could pace people and lead them, and then if he got the pacing wrong, they didn't follow in the leading, he'd go back and pace again. He didn't disconnect, that's something that we need to pay attention to because Dad, Dad was so good at it, he didn't talk about it enough, and we don't talk about it enough. We disconnect and we shut off instead. And then it's all downhill. So, let me tell you something else about the relationship. When I talked about this, sometimes, people have thought that, and I've heard the words used about Dad that he was sweet. Did you ever think of Dad sweet? Roxy? Sweet. Me either. But, loving, bright, kind, compassionate, not sweet. But I've heard that language. So I- when I said that Milton Erickson's work was about relationships, I've heard the word come back, it's come back to me a few time from people who have been clients of Milton Erickson's say, um, I think that he was really a sweet man and I said, No no no, that's not what his relationship was about. It was about being connected to the person. And sometimes it wasn't sweet at all. Now, we have a son, we have four- four children, and our younger son is a good example of this business of not having that sweet, loving, kind relationship. Joel was a very shy boy. He was about four, he was maybe five, when I, uh, remember talking to Dad a little bit about this. But Joel liked to hide behind Mama's skirts, and, you know, he didn't want to go out and do things with all the other kids, and he's my baby. I didn't mind, you know, I kind of liked my baby. But, it got to be, he was four now, and then he was five, and it was time for him to, to be able to be a little more independent. So we put him in preschool. And he came home from preschool, and he said, Not going to kindergarten next year, I'm going to wait another year and I'm going to first grade then. And he says, Kindergarten's just going to be too tough. I said, well, okay, Lance and I talked it over and we went to the school and we talked to the professionals there and they, uh, said, well maybe he's not ready. So, what happened was, uh- Oops. I ran out of power. Thought I was connected, but I'm not, so I'm really sorry about that. Let me just tell you about the killer kid. Doesn't matter what the slides show. I went to Phoenix that summer and Dad of course had talked to us about Joel, and what was going to happen with Joel, and he never said a word to us, he never tried to direct us, he never told us ever what to do, about anything. But Joel got there, and he called Joel into the living room to see him. And I thought, well I better go see what's going on, you know. Dad said, No, you don't need to, Joel's fine. So I peek around the corner, and Dad's showing Joel all these nice little trinkets, and set by his chair, and seemed to be good. And pretty sure, out comes Joel, and Joel, "Dad needed some water." So I thought, well, he's kinda awkward still, maybe I'd better just give him half a glass, so he got a half a glass of water, took it back. "No. It's not enough." Back out he came. 2/3 a glass of water, in he goes. "I said I want some water." Okay. Get him a full glass of water and in he goes again. Well, can you beat that, there's no ice in it. Well, my heart's beating fast, and Mom's scurrying around the kitchen, getting ice and so now we've got the ice and the water and Joel's back in there and Dad's being a little gruffy, but he's focused on that ice and that water and Joel getting it, I can tell you that. And then he said, "Okay now, you put it right there, Joel" and Joel put it down- That's not right. You move it over here. Now move it- now, now that's not quite right either, and move it here, and and and and oh my goodness. Pretty soon, I could see what was going to happen, that glass of water, with all that ice, went Pchew(ph), just like that. Right in Dad's lap. Ohhh, big glass of water, not a little glass of water, and Dad starts screaming. "Betty! Betty! Get this killer kid out of here! Get this killer kid! He's a killer kid! He's gonna kill me! Betty! Come and get him!" And I'm running for the towels, and Mom's running for the mops, and everybody's running cause there's Dad sitting, drenched with ice water. And Mom runs in and gets Dad and we mop everything up and I'm thinking, Oh man, this is just a big fiasco, wasn't it. And Dad comes back out of the bedroom and he's all dressed again, and he says, "Alright Joel, we're going to go out and look at the plants." Please! I thought please. "No, Cookie, you don't need to push me, Joel's going to push me." So off they went, down the little step, out across the sidewalk. Keplunk! Dad's all over the grass. Wheelchair's on its side. "Betty! Come get this killer kid, come get this killer kid!" Oh, just made my heart beat so fast. So we got Dad back in the chair, and Joel and Dad went off to looking at the plants while the rest of us calmed ourselves down and got together for a family picture. And I do wish I could have shown you that, but let me just tell you about it. There's a family picture that Dad and Joel came and got in. And right in the very middle is sitting Dad in his wheelchair, with his kid, with his hand right on Grandpa's hand. Standing there looking like this, like Holy Moly! When I looked back on that picture I thought, what is that all about? And then I began to remember the story. And you know, that was probably 25 years after it happened, and it was at that moment that I realized, Dad set that whole thing up. From beginning to end. He never disconnected with that kid, he never stopped with that kid, he stayed focused on what he was about to do, and from that moment on, Joel got out from behind the skirts. It was an amazing thing to make that discovery, that that's what really had happened. So, I was totally amazed, and I said to my son, "Joel, do you remember this?" and he said "Yeah." He said, "Do you know the rest of the story?" and no, I don't know the rest of the story. He said, "Well, Grandpa brought me in the next day and he showed me this piece of, uh, of melted metal. Now probably 50 people have seen that piece of melted metal and I'll bet you there's 50 stories about it. Because that's Milton Erickson's style. But what he said to my son was, "Now this was an airplane that one of my clients had. And the client said he was flying here to see me and he was in a hurry, didn't have much gas but he had enough gas. Said he had enough gas to get where he was going, so he came. And this is what he's got left, Joel said, I said, "What happened?" "Well what do you think happened?" And then Grandpa looked at him and he said, "Now the lesson is this. Don't ever run out of gas." Don't ever run out of gas, Jeff. So I'm leaving you with one lesson. Don't run out of gas. I asked Joel, what does that mean to you? And he said, "Well, I think what it meant was it's good to go on and do things and explore and be yourself, but you got to be conservative too, and you've got to be thoughtful about it." And I said that's a good lesson, if that's what it meant to you and that's fine. But that's a typical kind of thing that Milton Erickson did in relationships. So let- let me just quickly say to you that I think the key things that therapists have trouble with when they try to work with people with physical problems that are very resistant to change is that they fail to understand the issues of morbid grief. They fail to remember that people start at the stage of trust and maybe before, and we need to do that when we're working with people. I see Jeff looking at his watch, which says it's time to eat. Is that right? Yeah, okay. So for you, I would ask you to take things things away, use them if they work for you. Help yourself in any way and if there's anything that I can do for you or help you with while I'm here at this conference, please don't hesitate to contact me. Have a good evening. Have fun at the dance. Check your gas tank.
