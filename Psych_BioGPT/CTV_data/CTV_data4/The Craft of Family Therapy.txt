JEFFREY ZEIG So, ah, we are here to celebrate Sal Minuchin and, and in the history of the evolution conference there's been a few people who have gotten standing ovations before they start.

The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA Salvador Minuchin, MD, developed Structural Family Therapy, which addresses problems within a family by charting the relationships between family members or between subsets of family. He was Director of the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic. Although it was minimally staffed when he began, under his tutelage the Clinic grew to become one of the most modeled and respected child guidance facilities in the world. In 1981, Minuchin began his own family therapy center in new York. After his retirement in 1996, the center was renamed the Minuchin Center. Dr. Minuchin is the author of many notable books, including many classics. His latest sis Mastering Family Therapy: Journeys of Growth and Transformation. In 2007, a survey of 2,600 practitioners named Minuchin as one of the ten most influential therapists of the past quarter-century. #EVO2013 Sal's Decision to Keynote Dear Jeff, First, I want to thank you for your support; it was essential in my decision to attend the Evolution conference. Second, an Israeli story: Every years, at the end of the rainy season, one rain is called "The malkosh", indicating that it is the last rain. To me, my participation in Anaheim is my Malkosh - the last of my time of rain. For that reason, I would like your interviewing me. An interview is a ritual. I plan to go to California on the 9th and to return on teh 13th . If you can find me an hour on the 12th for a presentation and discussion of a session I did many years ago, I would enjoy presenting my therapy to an audience. Thanks Sal 

00:03:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Ah, you know, won't, uhm,-- I, I would trivialize anything that I would say about Sal's accomplishment his achievements one of the founders of The Family Therapy so, ah, I just go pass that. Ah, I want to give you some of the sense of the because when I originally invited everybody to be on the faculty of the evolution convergence I'll declined because of his, ah, failing health and then a couple of months ago I contacted him again and I said, well, could you reevaluate, I know that people here would very much appreciate having the opportunity to learn from you. And so, ah, Sal wrote, ah, "I want to thank you for your support it was essential in my decision to attend the Evolution conference. And second, an Israeli story. Every years, at the end of the rainy season, one rain is called "The malkosh", indicating that it is the last rain. And, ah, to me, my participation in Anaheim is my Malkosh. The time of last-- the last of my time of rain. For that reason, I would like your interviewing me. An interview is a ritual. Yeah. 

00:04:55
Sal and Jeff How I know Sal • Early 1970s • 1985 Paper: My many voices • My discussion at the 1995 Evolution Conference • Served on many conference faculties together. • Called when I turned 65; when my mother died. 

00:05:00
JEFFREY ZEIG So I, I know Sal for 40 years I, I was, ah, a student volunteer in workshop that he did in California in the very early 1970s he was just so intimidating to me because of those, you know, stature and, ah, how, ah, confronted he could specially with young man. And the 1985 when I invited him to speak at the first evolution conference and this was a moment in which everybody could present their theory. And what Sal did in that papers he wrote my many voices and he talk about how Virginia seat here talk through him. How Jay Haley talk through him. How Whitaker talk through him it was just amazing and brilliant, ah, ah, not trying to extol structural family therapy but talking about the influences the integrated influences which was really the heart of the conference. And, ah, I-- Sal and I have been on many podiums together and, you know, when I turn 65, ah, I called Sal. When my mother died I called Sal and so he has been incredibly dear and meaningful to me over so many years. 

00:06:15
Borges • "Cualquier destino, por largo y complicado que sea, consta en realidad de un solo momento: el momento en que el hombre sabe par siempre quié es" • El destino es el momento en la vida de una persona cuado se tiene en cuenta que va a ser para el resto de su vida. 

00:06:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm, I just want you to know the, the background of that. Ah, Borges almost said, ah, "El destino es el momento en la vida de una persona cuado se tiene en cuenta que va a ser para el resto de su vida." And, ah... 

00:06:40
SALVADOR MINUCHIN He said gringo. 

00:06:40
Structured Interview 

00:06:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Gringo. Yeah. So, des-- destiny is the moment in the life of a person when he takes account of who he will be for the rest of his life. And therapy well, that's a moment of destiny, can be a moment of destiny. And so I structured a little bit of an interview but of course, you know, Sal is got an orientation. When I graduated from high school we had to write a thesis, ah, ah, essay and the topic of the essay was "Adversity is the test to the strong person." So maybe we can start off with that challenge adversity is the test to the strong person. You've dealt with many challenges and perhaps you can talk with us about some of those challenges that you've dealt with and what they meant to you and how they help form who you are as a therapist? 

00:07:35
SALVADOR MINUCHIN Lonely. Thank you very much. Okay, I will try to do that. I will try to describe to you how I started and how-- and I was a very timid child in a rural town in Argentina. And how I became a challenger so this I think that through the, the describing of my life I will try to explain to you the influences that made me-- that made me think and that made the kind of therapy and see if I can describe the way in which my therapy has evolve. I will start with the idea of what is therapy. A therapy to me is a polemic that is disguise as a dialogue. Can I repeat that or you got it? 

00:08:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Oh, repeat it. 

00:08:45
SALVADOR MINUCHIN Okay. Because I start with the idea that all the people that come to therapy are wrong. And they are wrong because they are certain. Uncertainty is the enemy of change. And so, you know, empathy is to be able to understand the way in which a person is in life. But a therapeutic empathy needs to add to that the courage to challenge. The courage to challenge the way which the people are engage in bottoms that do not allow them to grow up. So the questions is, how do you challenge? And how do you challenge in such a way that people will hear you? Because if you challenge directly people will say people come to you next time and that you don't want to. So you challenge by saying you're richer that you are. You're richer than what you think you are. You have roads that you had travel and you had forgotten. And join me in a trick of rediscovering the complexity of your life. You said to pe-- to individual people. You said that to families and then different people do a different ways. So, Carl Whitaker would say, "If you're confuse cherish you confusion. You are already one step ending the game." Bowen would say, "Don't tell me what you feel. Tell me what you think." And Susan Johnson here today would say, "Don't tell me what you think. Tell me how you feel." And Michael White would said, "Tell me a different story." And somewhat people will percent all uncertainties to replace the certainties. And I said, "Don't be so certain." So, my view of therapy is that you introduce uncertainty. You introduce confusion, you introduce curiosity, you introduce hope and you introduce complexity. So how do you achieve that? Well - 

00:11:40
[sil.] 

00:11:45
SALVADOR MINUCHIN - you see Borges the descent Argentinean poet has a short story, two pages, called Borges and I. And in the story he says, "I am Angel Borges, the writer." Because he thinks all my secrets and writes it and gives it to his audience and so I am bereft of secrets. What Borges was saying was that the self is one but the self is two and the self is three and the self is four. And a ruler says, "I am multitudes, we are many." And what I wanna talk is about certainties and that's starts with the self. And I will give you a very short tool through my life telling you about four, five, six times in which I have a different uncertainty. Uncertainties are unchallengeable. And then, the other certainty was different than the first certainty. And the other was different than the first certainty. And so on and so for and we are able to talk our self when really selves are layered and there is one on top of the other, in top of the other, in top of the other, in top of the other and we call that self. But this self is created by using gothic aspects of behavior feeling thinking that are created in significant context. So all these selves are a different points of attachment to different-- in different historical periods with significant people. So, attachment is not what happen to me in my family and that is my adult drive. No, when I was four years old a child-- the older son in a our family in Argentina, small rural town very anticipated. I was very child-- tiny child I remember the voice of my mother, I remember the voice of my father they we're talking about care and about ethics. My mother was talking about care, my father was talking about ethics, about responsibilities. My responsibility at this time was to being a Jew. And a Jew means to be an order and to be inferior and time to pass. And my responsibility was to my 200 cousins and my responsibility was to reduce community in Argentina and that was my identity. I didn't know anyone that was not Jewish and I and would not think that I had any responsibility toward them. Twenty years later I was in medical school there was a revolution, a dictator came Perón, and the students in the medical school rebel against Perón. I was part of the group that rebel against Perón. I was in jail, spend three months in jail. Was a wonderful group of people, student-- really. Students, union labors, then I, my identity change. I was in Argentinean Jew. I was a reverend. I was liberal and I was one of the people that needed to move when needs, when on justice came it was my responsibility to come forward. Very different than my previous identity. In 48 Israel was born for the Jew as a Jewish, ah, entity and I was a Zionist and I went to Israel and I was a doctor in the Israel army. And there I was not a chi-- a child anymore I was not in Argentinean rebel anymore. I was in hierarchy composition my-- the, ah, soldiers were younger they look at me, at me as a care taking figure as a Š and I was-- it's a very different way of thinking about myself at this point. And then, because I wanted to be, ah, child psychiatrist, I went to the United States and my fourth identity was as a n immigrant. And whoever is an immigrant here knows that being an immigrant is an exercise on problem solving and you are resilient or you die? You have two alternatives. 

00:17:20
[sil.] 

00:17:25
SALVADOR MINUCHIN And one of the things of being an immigrant is that you lose respon-- respect for language. Because language becomes a table, is shoolkhan in Hebrew, is mesa in Spanish, is tish in Yiddish, is tavolo in Italia. And so you begin to think that then which is to be suspected. And from that came an orientation to talk in metaphors. Metaphors are not precise. Metaphors always is an approximation and therefore they are much more precise as a language and as an instrument for therapist metaphors are the instrument that you'll need to talk. In this period I'm it but, I'm married and that was my fifth identity. Because at the point in which you married your language changes and your language is the language is complementarily. And from then till now it is 62 years. 

00:18:45
[sil.] 

00:18:50
SALVADOR MINUCHIN We had married, divorce, remarried, divorce, remarried. And we are together. So, you see then I am talking about selves, I am talking about identities and I had this guy five, six but this is when I was before 4, 3 years old. Since then I had over seven, eight 10 and I want to tell you that this is what happen to you. That the concept of self is, ah, simple concept and is a simplistic concept. And if you want to change people you need to challenge certainties and identities come with certainties because identities come in context that create patterns that demand from new certain type of area, so you're stuck. So, how do I do-- would, would done things? You see I ask Jeff that at some point I will lose the trend and then he need to say, "awake." So, I-- from that where do I want to go? Well... 

00:20:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Well how would this, how would this identities develop who you are as a therapist? 

00:20:35
SALVADOR MINUCHIN Who I am as a therapist? Well, I was lucky. I was lucky because I never was a psychiatrist in a psychiatric world. I finish my psychiatric, ah, program in, ah, in New York and I spend four months with Lauretta Bender trying to talk about child schizophrenia and we all talk like this children and it was a mess. But essentially I work with juvenile delinquency in an institution of juvenile delinquent. And that is a completely different way of working. Because you work with groups. You work in relationship. You work in the realities of life and later in life I went back to Israel, I work with Holocaust children with children's of Arab countries. I understood something about culture there and because I was bright and will say young psychiatrist we came back to the United State because at this point all bright psychiatrist wanted to be psychoanalyst and I wanted to be a psychoanalyst. So I went to psy-- psychoanalytic school and I spend four years in psychoanalysis and my analyst said, "Sal, you are a cork on the crest of a wave and when the waves more there you go." And she was wrong. But she was also right of course. But while I was there training in psychoanalyst I am was fortunate to have a job and I needed a job because we were very, very poor and at this point I was-- I got a job working a in resident-- in, ah, agency for, ah,-- I don't remember the name of the agency in any case they pay me 270 sap-- 275 an hour. And that is when the patient came. But the-- all thing that I got, the job at Wiltwyck School for Boys, that was a school for boys it was a residence for the delinquent children, for children from Harlem. Most of them were like American, most of them were Latinos. And all the population of psychiatrist and psychologist and so on of course were middle class White American. And Wiltwyck was like other schools at bo-- like residence at schools. You take the children from Harlem, you take them to place where it is as far as they can from the place of residence. You put them in a laundry in, ah, washing machine and after two years you them about to, ah, to, uhm, Harlem and they come back. In '58 we read one article by Jackson that says our impossibility of working with families. And that was our training in family therapy. It was easy, it was one article-- not long. And we decided, "Okay, we have all the theory now we open it wall on to-- we open a hole on the wall. We put a one way mirror, we put three people be-- behind the one way mirror to see what we are going in front of the one way mirror and we look there was there family therapies and we began to see the families of the children. We had two people working in front of the family and see people working-- watching what we were doing. We had a city stage session we met with a family for half an hour. We had a break we went to one way-- beyond the one way mirror and we ask, "What did we do?" And they told us and we left. In that way we'll-- that is-- that was our training. And so were-- we'll began to think a modified that people are connected and we began to be systemic family therapist and that was one of the moment in which my life change because I did what few psychiatrist use to do at this time. I thought that for families can be talk to and can be talk with and that they can talk with you, and that they understand. And it this point-- and it was not very long welfare families were not consider appropriate material for psychotherapy. I hope that some will hear tells me I'm wrong but I think I am right. So the look at poverty and what poverty does to families for psychiatrist was a novelty. And with that came the voice of my father talking about ethics and talking of a social justice. And my therapy then-- after a while I was strain by might-- the families that I was working and I grew up and I develop when I was an immigrant I develop the capacity to work with uncertainty and to say, "I don't know", because all immigrants find themselves in that position. And if you are able to say, "I don't know", people teach you, people help you. And so I said to these families, "I don't know", and they thought me something about poverty and about the injustice that these, these are systems. The metal health systems. Ah, the welfare system, thus to families. By the institutions that we had created to clean families that are poor from their children. And I work in New York, ah, this time I work with four commissioners of welfare we work with, ah, families of the poor. We work with families of, uhm, that were in party-- foster homes. Okay. I, I am asking Pat to help me. Ah, foster for families we develop programs of how to work with poor families. And at the point in which we were working in New York there were in New York 50,000 children foster home. Fifty thousand children think about that, a small city of children that will taking away from the families and put into poster homes and the children there have to families. The biological families that will bed and the foster families that will also bed. In both of this families we're saying the other family is bed and we try to create programs in which the two families became a one foster fam-- a one family and the end results, family that was, that combine of the poster families and the-- and that was a big change. And we try to demerge to, to create that as a way of working in this institutions. We work with so many institutions trying to alert people that work with children that the best way of working with children in the institution is to get the families involve in the treatment of the child. So that was one of the ways in which I am fallowing the fact that I must have been a very angry child because I was continuously challenging patterns. I was continuously looking at ways in which the patterns were wrong. My way of apprehending truth was by saying first, I'm angry. And then, I begin to understand why I was angry and then I incorporated as a theory but essentially I'm not authorities I'm a clinician. I'm a clinician and everything that I wrote was after I had done something and look at that and said, "Oh! That is nice." And I was surprise. When I was surprise I wrote it. 

00:31:35
[sil.] 

00:31:40
SALVADOR MINUCHIN What else do I want to say? Ah, okay. How do I work? Well, first I want to tell you that I work different when I was 50 then I when-- when now that I am 92 I changed. But I changed with some changes I kept certain systemic, concept in that but I change in the way which I was working because I was changing. I was a very energetic young man and I am attire to old man. So I use your work, I use metaphors but I wrote a book recently that is not in the bookstore. Ah, and I am angry at the publishing company that, that works nothing. But I am teaching my students now, ah, how to challenge families in an three, four areas. You know, when you are old what you try is to synthesize. You try to clean your concepts and you become more universal. Your concepts are more global and you hope that they are more universal. So I teach my students for challenges in four areas. The first area that, that the therapist need to challenge is the area that there is one patient. The idea is that you need a three at least-- Bowen us to say, "Three people to maintain a battle." The couple therapist say two people, but Bowen use to say three people and I agree with Bowen. So, the first thing that we challenge is the fact that there is one patient and the first thing that we do is to externalize the fact that there is one patient. And we externalize that by saying, by demonstrating to the family how the, the patient is distribute is the family and the family maintains the pathologic pattern. The second thing that we challenge is a certainty that the individual is one. The-- there is one self and we talk about the multitude of selves and how we can use the different self to introduce answer to begging to introduce the idea that different selves have alternatives that all ourselves exclude. And so for the therapist you begin to say that in that circumstance you were different. You thought about yourself in different ways. The third thing that we do is to use the family as the context to create uncertainty, confusion and the recognition that in different context and the family is a multiple context, in different context you are, you believe, you relate in different ways. I am a therapist and I am very intrusive. I was very intrusive, I continue being very intrusive but now I am much softer and my intrusions are intrusions of a grandfather so it's easier to do it. But, but, but one of the things that I had develop through my growing life is the ability to not work. My ability to be a therapist that is influential and descendant. Influential and descendant, I am a, a clinician that is uncertainty expert and I am influential and descendant. Okay, are we there? Yes. Okay, so when I enter into-- in connecting with the family first I said, "I don't know who you are." And they tell me what they are, and I said, "Can you talk with each other? Because I don't you and I would like to know how you talk." And this point I move back, I look at my left foot, ah, and I tell my students to become aware of the nature of the foot work that where. And that is the way in which they become invincible. And I try I am a choreograph. I am not, ah, ah, writer. I am a dramatist and I am a choreographer. And the choreography that I do is to say to people, "Talk with her. Talk with him." And by doing that and becoming an observer of the things that happen I then introduce myself and saying, "You know, as you begin to dance I see that you dance salsa. Or you sal-- dance a rumba. Can you--" I said to him, "help your wife to-- there was your daughter in a different way?" And I try to make of each family member a healer of the other. So one of the things that I do is I am influential and descendant and I make every family member a patient and every family member a healer. Is that possible to encompass? Because I will show you tomorrow to the people that come here I will show you two families for one to 10 minutes and other 15 minutes and demonstrate in this two families how everything that I learn for 62 years I can teach in half an hour. It's a full, full program. I think that, that's what, what I have to say. 

00:39:10
JEFFREY ZEIG You're doing good. You're doing great. Ah, say something about how you become part of the system. How does the therapist become integrated into the system. What does that mean? 

00:39:25
SALVADOR MINUCHIN Let me think about it. How does the therapy become part of the system? 

00:39:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Therapist. 

00:39:30
SALVADOR MINUCHIN Well I will tell you something else that this a response to you. On of the things that I teach my students is that the therapist is a self aware instrument, self aware instrument. And in order to become a self aware instrument the therapist need to be able to be proximal and not in. And in order to be proximal influential and descendant he needs to develop in his left shoulder a leprechaun. A small homunculus the dress in green that looks like but is in continuous contact with you in dialogue with you is saying, "You know, you are doing that and that is your impact and they are doing that to you and that is there impact to you." And so you are inside but you are always outside. You are also in a position, in a meta position thinking about what you will do. So there is no spontaneity in therapy. I had watch and I am an observer of therapist and I know that when he's talking he's doing something and I am very curious always what is he doing because I know he knows that he do it, that he does it. The other person does not that he does it, but he knows. And I use to say to, ah, Whitaker, "You know, you don't know what you do. Do you want me to tell you what you do?" Because Whitaker was intuition in spontaneity and I am never spontaneous when I, uhm, a therapist. Of course that as you become a senior person and as you become a therapist, a senior therapist you have things that come very fast immediately spontaneously to you. You have a way of seeing patterns because there is no patterns that you had not seeing already. So the ability tos-- to enter into family and be immediate a member of the family. If I say to people, "Talk to her", and I will listen at this point I become an uncle. At this point I become a member of the family and I am in and all the time I'm out. Did I answer it? 

00:42:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Good. Very good. So it was a moment, a moment to test in me. There was a moment, a defining moment when you knew that you were a therapist. You knew that you're a good therapist. 

00:42:35
SALVADOR MINUCHIN I am? 

00:42:35
JEFFREY ZEIG It was a moment in your life when you knew. 

00:42:40
SALVADOR MINUCHIN Yeah. But I don't know when it was. You know, it's, it's whole life and I started doing therapy, ah, 60 years ago that's a long time. I made lot of people that me, "You know, we met in Denmark. And I, I'm so happy that we met in Denmark." But I don't remember. And when they tell me, suddenly I have a memory and it is one of the greatest gift that people do to me. When I-- when they give me back a memory. At this time I have a lot of empty space. Maybe there are some question, some questions do we have here? 

00:43:40
JEFFREY ZEIG But what, what would you say about how therapy has evolve over those 60 years? How have you seen a change? 

00:43:45
SALVADOR MINUCHIN Oy! Oy! Oy! That was an answer. You know, I really-- one of my certainties, uhm, 40 years ago was 30 years ago, 20 years ago was in the new millennium all therapist will be contextual. All therapist will think of people as connected in social context and that was-- and as-- a certainty that was absolutely wrong because that is not happening. And one of the things why I heard the silent to talk about me as a challenger is that there are a lot of young people here. A lot of young people that are being educated in a way of looking people that is simplistic. And I hope that-- an influence for you to think the dysfunction of the therapist is beyond the individual that you are seeing. Is beyond the family that you're seeing. Is beyond the neighborhood that you're seeing it takes-- you know Michael White was a person that clearly establish the idea that therapy is a therapy of societies. I think that therapy is a therapy of societies and that we have a function, but we are not train. You know, when I began to-- they trying to influence political figures I realized I was enrolling. I did not know the training. To how do you talk with politicians? How do you talk with senior members of the department of welfare? In ways that you connect with them and in ways that you change and it and I did not know how to do it. Slowly, I learn how to do it but it cause me a tremendous amount of failure. Working with full was the social systems in the United States in an exercising failure. Ah, is an exercising in getting up and failing again and at certain point you said, "Oh! that's the norm." And when you decide that's the norm then you can abandon the field or try again. And I hope to try again. 

00:46:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Interesting. 

00:46:45
[sil.] 

00:46:50
JEFFREY ZEIG So one of the things that you're saying subtexts is that knowledge does not produce change? 

00:47:00
SALVADOR MINUCHIN That was a joke? Yes, of course. 

00:47:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Yeah. So, it's the use of metaphor, the use of uncertainty, destabilizing but then you begin to create a pattern, you begin to elicit a pattern. 

00:47:15
SALVADOR MINUCHIN Absolutely. 

00:47:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:47:20
SALVADOR MINUCHIN Absolutely. When I am talking about the fact that I am a challenger of patterns is because I understand patterns and the challenging of patterns is by replacing this patterns that put people in, in a case was patterns that emphasize multiplicity, alternatives. Is the challenge from certainty to alternatives, to possibilities and to me that is toward therapist, this is therapy of richness. So when I said to people, "You are wrong", I'm saying, "You are wrong", because you are richer than what you think you are. Because you insist in doing the same thing, because you insist in going through all patterns and that keeps you incase. And the case sometimes is gilded and when the case is gilded, when the case is love it's very difficult to challenge. It's very difficult to challenge a gilded case, that is a functional therapist. And in order to do that you always need to be outside. So empathy really does not mean you join. Empathy in therapy means you're able and you have courage to challenge certainties. That's a good finish, you know? That's a good. 

00:48:55
JEFFREY ZEIG We still have about five minutes if you want to take it. 

00:49:00
SALVADOR MINUCHIN Yeah. Okay. Do you want to give some questions? 

00:49:05
JEFFREY ZEIG We think that we only have about five minutes but let me see if I can follow. People come in they a presenting problem. They're giving you a presenting problem. Now are you ignoring the presenting problem? Are you addressing the presenting problem? 

00:49:20
SALVADOR MINUCHIN Okay. I will answer with, uhm, experiment that last at five years. Ah, at certain point in the Philadelphia Children's Clinic and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia we began to have families with anorectic patients. And anorexia is a very visible pattern. People became seen, remain seen and can die. And I said at this point we cannot about-- ah,-- we cannot dismiss the symptom. The symptom was very, very serious and I said, "Well about eating together. Today, you, Mrs. Lopez(ph) bring food for all of us." And we ate together so I working looking at the symptom but what I was doing is-- and then we ate and when we ate together of course the patterns of control that control the symptom become very visible. And then I would begin to challenge the patterns of control and saying to people, "You cannot challenge eating habits but you can challenge all the things about the way in which people relate with each other." And so very, very fast I move through this entrance in this symptom to the patterns that maintain the symptom and to looking at the way in which people maintain the same certainties that immobilized them. So that was, that experiment lasted five years we work with, ah, large number of anorectic families and we had a lot of success. And still today anorectic children are treated in the same old ways. So, one of the things that young people need to understand is that to produce changes in largest systems is very difficult and it need to be a repetitive infusion of uncertainty. And then you bring some models and then you do all kind of thing. It's okay? 

00:52:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Very okay. So, uhm, you know, perhaps at this moment you've crated, ah, some seeds in people's minds, some ideas and concepts that can be a moment of destiny for them that can change their orientation and they can be into think about uncertainty about how to understand patterns. How to elicit flexibility and how to use the multiplicity of selves that we all have in order to empower therapy, in order to make therapy work. 

00:52:40
SALVADOR MINUCHIN I got? 

00:52:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

00:52:45
SALVADOR MINUCHIN What do we do now? 

00:52:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, is it-- well, is there any other. So we have lot of a inspiring therapist here a lot of people who are just starting and, ah, what wisdom would you have? What would you want them to know? What would you want them to study? 

00:53:00
SALVADOR MINUCHIN What do I want them to study? 

00:53:00
JEFFREY ZEIG What would you want to be? 

00:53:05
SALVADOR MINUCHIN Was me. I would love to. But, you know, you know, the, the road to Rome, the road to Jerusalem is very diverse. So, ah, I, I cannot be wise in that way. So just-- no I cannot answer that question. There are any questions there is anybody here that want to ask a question? 

00:53:45
JEFFREY ZEIG But it would have to very brief. 

00:53:45
SALVADOR MINUCHIN Very brief. We have two minutes. 

00:53:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. 

00:53:50
SALVADOR MINUCHIN We have two minutes. Any question of two minutes? Where is she? 

00:54:00
JEFFREY ZEIG I don't know. I can't see. Uh-huh. Well, eh... 

00:54:05
SALVADOR MINUCHIN What? 

00:54:10
JEFFREY ZEIG What would be-- what would you say with, ah, really defining triumphs major triumphs that - 

00:54:15
SALVADOR MINUCHIN The what? 

00:54:15
JEFFREY ZEIG - the major triumphs in, in your career as a therapist major turning points that made a difference in how you conceptualize the task therapy? 

00:54:30
SALVADOR MINUCHIN I don't know about that. Ah, I, I really-- when, ah, when I am talking about selves as layer and multiple the truth is that the experience is of oneself moving through history and at some point you changed and you don't know that you had changed. And you continue changing and you don't know that you had changed. And at some point you said, "Ah! I see that." And you crystallize this moment as if it is the moment in which you change but it's not true. You recognized that you had change it's always something that you recognize a past even and you said, "I had change." And I had change many ways. 

00:55:25
