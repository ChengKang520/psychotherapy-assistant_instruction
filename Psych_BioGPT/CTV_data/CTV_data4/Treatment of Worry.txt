Treatment of Worry 

00:00:15
Reid Wilson, PhD 

00:00:15
DR. REID WILSON  So, you -- 

00:00:40
BARBARA Am I feeling courageous? 

00:00:40
DR. REID WILSON -- you volunteered to come up and talk about this. Are you feeling courageous about this project? 

00:00:45
BARBARA Um, not really. 

00:00:50
DR. REID WILSON Uh-huh. Okay. What are you feeling? 

00:00:50
BARBARA A little bit anxious. 

00:00:50
DR. REID WILSON Uh-huh. Well, that would be two of us. 

00:00:55
BARBARA Okay, good. 

00:00:55
DR. REID WILSON Okay. Now, you might have to wipe your hand on your -- after that. Sorry. Apologize. Um, so rumor is you're a worrier. 

00:01:05
BARBARA Yes. 

00:01:05
DR. REID WILSON True? Can you tell me a little bit about that? 

00:01:10
BARBARA Well, I actually was not aware that I was a worrier, until all my friends started to tell me that, and my family as well. And then it became, you know, apparent that that was the consensus opinion amongst everybody. In fact, my best friend gave me a big poster, which I have on my refrigerator, which has to do with worrying and how it empties today of, uh, you know, its strength and gives tomorrow -- something or other. I had never paid a lot of attention to it. But yes, I'm a worrier. 

00:01:40
DR. REID WILSON Now, I have good news for you: You don't ever have to look at them again. In fact, what I want you to do is just pretend that you and I are in a therapy this session and they're -- 

00:01:50
BARBARA Oh. 

00:01:50
DR. REID WILSON -- gonna observe us. So -- so then it'll be more intimate for us. 

00:01:55
BARBARA That sounds good. 

00:01:55
DR. REID WILSON I didn't tell you that before. So -- 

00:01:55
BARBARA No, you didn't. 

00:01:55
DR. REID WILSON So -- so let's -- 

00:02:00
BARBARA Okay. 

00:02:00
DR. REID WILSON -- do it that way, if it's okay with you. 

00:02:00
BARBARA Good. 

00:02:00
DR. REID WILSON So -- so can you just tell me, kind of, topics that you worry about? 

00:02:05
BARBARA Well, every month, just before most of my bills come due, I have a tizzy fit; I -- I simply can't get myself to sit down and do them. 

00:02:15
DR. REID WILSON Is that like a conniption fit but -- 

00:02:15
BARBARA  More or less. 

00:02:20
DR. REID WILSON Okay. 

00:02:20
BARBARA Yes. I -- I can't get myself to sit down and do them. Um, I take them from one room to the other, I put them on my filing cabinet, the bills; I put them on my desk. And I do online banking, for the most part. So, uh, it -- it becomes almost comical except that I'm in a great deal of distress over it. 

00:02:35
DR. REID WILSON So you're shifting them around different places -- 

00:02:35
BARBARA Or around the house. 

00:02:35
DR. REID WILSON -- as though getting ready to -- 

00:02:40
BARBARA Yes. 

00:02:40
DR. REID WILSON -- do it? 

00:02:40
BARBARA Yes. 

00:02:40
DR. REID WILSON Is that what you're doing? 

00:02:40
BARBARA And every day I say, 'Well, today I'm gonna do these bills;' I make lists; I say it at the top, "Do the bills." And invariably I get them in just under the wire. Um -- 

00:02:50
DR. REID WILSON So there's some procrastination goin on. What -- 

00:02:50
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:02:50
DR. REID WILSON How is that connected with your worry, do you -- do you think? 

00:02:55
BARBARA I -- I -- I don't really -- I've not really analyzed it, but I know that I have, you know, this sense of 'Oh, you know, I won't be able to pay them. I won't have enough money. I won't get to them when I'm supposed to get to them.' Um -- yes. 

00:03:05
DR. REID WILSON  So -- so the procrastination actually generates its own worry -- 

00:03:10
BARBARA  Yes. 

00:03:15
DR. REID WILSON -- which is 'Oh no, I haven't gone to it yet,' so that kind of stays on your mind. And -- 

00:03:15
BARBARA Yes. 

00:03:15
DR. REID WILSON -- like, tonight you go, 'Okay, tomorrow I'm gonna get it done,' and then tomorrow comes and you don't. And then you -- 

00:03:20
BARBARA Right. 

00:03:20
DR. REID WILSON So, it's hanging out up here in mind, taking up room, which is what your mind does. If -- if you got tasks to be done -- 

00:03:30
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:03:30
DR. REID WILSON -- and you're not getting to them, the mind holds onto it up front. Even if you if you say, 'Oh, I'll get to it,' if it doesn't believe you're gonna get to it - you know what I mean - it will hold it in the front of your mind. So you're familiar with that, right? 

00:03:45
BARBARA Yes. It starts -- 

00:03:45
DR. REID WILSON And that's a kind of worry. 

00:03:45
BARBARA -- even before that, coz when they come in in the mail, I don't open them up. I never open the bills -- 

00:03:50
DR. REID WILSON Okay, coz -- 

00:03:50
BARBARA -- until that very last minute. 

00:03:50
DR. REID WILSON -- like, out of sight, out of mind -- 

00:03:50
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:03:50
DR. REID WILSON -- you think -- 

00:03:55
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:03:55
DR. REID WILSON -- right? So -- so you worry about money and paying bills and -- anything else on the list? 

00:03:55
BARBARA  Well, on a daily basis. You know, if somebody has -- it's generally to do with my family. But if somebody has a problem, that becomes my problem, um, despite the fact that I tell myself they're adults, so they can handle it, you know. Um, I I feel somehow responsible for helping them fixing it, which they always tell me 'Stop trying to fix it.' But I worry. 

00:04:20
DR. REID WILSON Any current ongoing ones that you would share in terms of your family, the types of things that you're dwelling on or worrying about? 

00:04:30
BARBARA Well -- 

00:04:30
DR. REID WILSON Themes? 

00:04:30
BARBARA Yeah. My youngest son, who's no kid, actually he's in his thirties, um, you know, is in the process of career change and, um, has been unemployed for a while out in California. So I -- you know, on a regular basis I worry about whether he's going to be able to make it, whether this career choice is a good one. 

00:04:50
DR. REID WILSON This is gonna sound like a silly question -- 

00:04:50
BARBARA Yes. 

00:04:50
DR. REID WILSON -- okay? But why? 

00:04:55
BARBARA Why? 

00:04:55
DR. REID WILSON Why you're worrying about -- why? You know, he's 30-something. 

00:04:55
BARBARA It's not an intentional thing. I don't say to myself, 'Okay, now it's time to worry about this, or now it's time to worry about that.' It just sort of happens. It's not -- 

00:05:05
DR. REID WILSON But let's even go -- I'll ask you another probing question. So -- but if we went under that idea, if you magically tomorrow morning woke up and didn't worry about that regarding him, do you think there'd be a worry about giving that worry up? 

00:05:25
BARBARA No. 

00:05:25
DR. REID WILSON Really. 

00:05:25
BARBARA No. No, I think there are days that I -- 

00:05:25
DR. REID WILSON You know, do you think it'd be okay with you? 

00:05:25
BARBARA  There are days I don't worry about everything, you know. 

00:05:30
DR. REID WILSON Okay. 

00:05:30
BARBARA It's -- it's not like it's a nonstop thing. Certainly I'm functioning fairly well. 

00:05:35
DR. REID WILSON Yeah, but I'm just trying to see is there a driver that you might know about that keeps you focused on my -- so what's - like, he's gonna not get the new job or he's not gonna have enough money and -- I mean, normal parent worry. 

00:05:45
BARBARA  Yeah. 

00:05:50
DR. REID WILSON But it -- that subroutine of worry may come up more frequently and not that productive for you. Is that what you're saying with worries like with your son? 

00:06:00
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:06:00
DR. REID WILSON Coz you're gonna have em -- 

00:06:00
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:06:00
DR. REID WILSON -- of course. So -- okay, so money and family. Any other kinds of -- 

00:06:05
BARBARA Right, and even my career, you know -- 

00:06:05
DR. REID WILSON Okay. 

00:06:05
BARBARA -- and making -- 

00:06:05
DR. REID WILSON Work? 

00:06:05
BARBARA -- my own shift in career, and, uh, looking to do something I've wanted to do for 20 years and haven't quite gotten to. So that's something I'm thinking I need to do before time runs out. 

00:06:15
DR. REID WILSON  And is that a worry or is that again a procrastination? 

00:06:20
BARBARA It's a worry because it's like, will -- you know, will I be good at that, will -- you know, will, uh, people want to come to my groups, uh, you know, will -- will I be successful, will I be able to be helpful. You know, those kinds of things worry me, yeah. 

00:06:35
DR. REID WILSON  I want to ask you another crazy question: Why? I mean, why -- just see what -- you go, 'Why worry about that part of it?' -- 

00:06:50
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:06:50
DR. REID WILSON -- just so I can get some information about why. So you have this career that you might wanna shift into -- 

00:06:55
BARBARA Well, see, that -- 

00:06:55
DR. REID WILSON -- and you're not quite sure how good you're going to be at it and -- 

00:06:55
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:06:55
DR. REID WILSON -- you might be inadequate but -- so you dwell on that, and that kind of feeds into -- 

00:07:00
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:07:00
DR. REID WILSON -- postponing -- 

00:07:05
BARBARA Right. 

00:07:05
DR. REID WILSON -- right? So why? 

00:07:05
BARBARA  I don't think that I do it on a conscious level. I -- I mean, it's not like I say, 'Oh, I'm going to worry today,' or 'Let's worry about this.' It's that it happens. 

00:07:15
DR. REID WILSON Okay. So as we go along, we'll track -- let's see if we track that a little bit and maybe something will pop up around that. And let me say one other thing to you about how this kinda happens. Because of the demand characteristics of this task 

00:07:30
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:07:30
DR. REID WILSON -- I might interrupt you as you're talking sometimes. And I don't mean to offend you about that; it's only coz I've got the information I want and I'm gonna go to something else with you. 

00:07:35
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:07:35
DR. REID WILSON  You okay with -- 

00:07:40
BARBARA Sure. 

00:07:40
DR. REID WILSON -- that? And if I don't -- again, sorry ahead of time about that. So you got money and family and work. 

00:07:45
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:07:45
DR. REID WILSON Are you worried about health at all? 

00:07:45
BARBARA Oh, that's a biggie. 

00:07:50
DR. REID WILSON Oh, what a surprise. Can you -- 

00:07:50
BARBARA  But there's not a lot I can do about that. 

00:07:55
DR. REID WILSON Well, can you say what -- what the health worries -- 

00:07:55
BARBARA Yeah, I have some chronic illnesses that, um, keep cropping up and creating crises, yeah, and -- 

00:08:05
DR. REID WILSON I heard what you said, which is, 'But there's nothing I can do about it.' 

00:08:10
BARBARA Well, I do what I can. 

00:08:10
DR. REID WILSON You know the question that that leads me to ask. 

00:08:10
BARBARA Yes. 

00:08:10
DR. REID WILSON  Well, why, then? 

00:08:15
BARBARA  Okay, I do what I think I need to do, what I'm told I should do. Um, but I almost feel like it's, you know, the luck of the draw, bad genes, that kinda thing, you know. Um -- 

00:08:30
DR. REID WILSON  Why do you worry about it if you're doing what you think you need to do? 

00:08:40
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:08:40
DR. REID WILSON And I'm not saying like -- 

00:08:40
BARBARA Why do I worry about it? 

00:08:40
DR. REID WILSON -- 'Why do you worry?' I'm -- I'm actually wanting us to be curious about that -- 

00:08:45
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:08:45
DR. REID WILSON -- because -- 

00:08:45
BARBARA Why do I worry about that? Well -- 

00:08:50
DR. REID WILSON -- if we could start shaping what that is, then we've got something to work with a little bit. And -- 

00:08:55
BARBARA Right. 

00:08:55
DR. REID WILSON -- I could make some guesses, I guess. And -- 

00:08:55
BARBARA Well -- 

00:08:55
DR. REID WILSON -- could you? 

00:08:55
BARBARA -- the things that I -- you know, the actual worry, um, is something that is possible, you know, in terms of happening and, um -- and in many cases has happened. I don't mean to be particularly vague. For example, I have heart problems and, uh, so I land in the hospital periodically. And I don't like the idea of going into the hospital, so I worry about that. 

00:09:20
DR. REID WILSON So part of it is, 'Am I doing the right thing? Am I taking care of myself? Is there something else I should be doing? Is there any advice my son needs from me? Can I think of anything I might share with him that would -- do I need to clip an article out that I saw that might help him get a job?' 

00:09:30
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:09:30
DR. REID WILSON 'Do I have enough -- do I have to do something different around my money to make sure I can pay the bills every month? You know, if I launch into to this career -- a new career, I'm going to spend, you know, psychic energy, even finances, I'm gonna let go of something else I'm doing to do this; is it gonna backfire? Am I gonna regret it later?' 

00:09:50
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:09:50
DR. REID WILSON These are some of the reasons I might worry about. Do they -- 

00:09:55
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:09:55
DR. REID WILSON Does it sound a little like -- 

00:10:00
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:10:00
DR. REID WILSON -- why you might? 

00:10:00
BARBARA Yeah. It's interesting because I -- I don't usually think -- as I said, I -- I'm kind of in denial about the worrying. You know, I only became aware of it because people told me I was doing it. 

00:10:10
DR. REID WILSON Oh, yeah. 

00:10:10
BARBARA So, um, I -- 

00:10:10
DR. REID WILSON How do you like to wake up about it now? How are you likin this? It's like -- 

00:10:15
BARBARA So I'm thinking to myself -- 

00:10:15
DR. REID WILSON -- 'Yeah' -- 

00:10:15
BARBARA -- 'Do I do all those things?' I don't know. Um, I don't know. 

00:10:15
DR. REID WILSON  I think -- 

00:10:20
BARBARA What you're saying sounds -- 

00:10:20
DR. REID WILSON -- all the things I just said are -- 

00:10:20
BARBARA -- sounds reasonable. 

00:10:20
DR. REID WILSON -- legitimate reasons -- 

00:10:20
BARBARA Yes. 

00:10:20
DR. REID WILSON -- to be thinking about -- 

00:10:20
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:10:20
DR. REID WILSON -- those things. 

00:10:25
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:10:25
DR. REID WILSON So if -- all those things that you're talking about, I would -- if I were in your shoes, I would have those worries too. So what I want us to distinguish between -- we're not -- not saying, like, get rid of those themes. 

00:10:35
BARBARA Yes. 

00:10:35
DR. REID WILSON  But what we want to see what we can do is can we compartmentalize that a little more so that you have a little more choice over how you spend your mental time, right, so that you can, you know, worry when you think it's a good idea to worry, instead of finding yourself worrying. 

00:10:55
BARBARA Um-hum. Um-hum. 

00:10:55
DR. REID WILSON Would that be okay with you? 

00:11:00
BARBARA That -- go for it. Just -- 

00:11:00
DR. REID WILSON Okay. 

00:11:00
BARBARA I am fine with that. 

00:11:00
DR. REID WILSON But let me ask the question to you: If you were worrying less -- 

00:11:05
BARBARA Yeah? 

00:11:05
DR. REID WILSON -- in a good way that you -- 

00:11:05
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:11:05
DR. REID WILSON -- set down the worries that are necessary, would that matter? What -- 

00:11:10
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:11:10
DR. REID WILSON What -- 

00:11:10
BARBARA Yeah, it would. 

00:11:15
DR. REID WILSON What do you want that -- that worry might be in your way? 

00:11:15
BARBARA Yeah. Although I say that I'm not, you know, conscious about -- you know, consciously worrying, things do come to a head with all the worrying, you know, that invariably I get all tied up in knots over, you know, something or other, and -- and it takes me a while -- 

00:11:30
DR. REID WILSON Uh, time out. 

00:11:30
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:11:30
DR. REID WILSON Tell me what that means: "I get all tied up" -- 

00:11:35
BARBARA Well -- 

00:11:35
DR. REID WILSON -- "in knots." 

00:11:35
BARBARA Well, for example, you know, just before I finally do something about the bills, I'm like a lunatic; at least that's how I see myself, coz I'm like, 'Ugh, don't talk to me. I can't stand it. You know, why I'm stuck with all this stuff?,' you know, that kind of thing. I become very um -- feeling very persecuted, let me put it that way, you know. Or 'Why does' -- you know, 'Why does everybody -- you know, why do I have to have all these illnesses? Why I can't be like everybody?' So I get -- I get -- it escalates. And -- 

00:12:00
DR. REID WILSON Okay. 

00:12:00
BARBARA And so as I say, although I'm not consciously worrying, invariably it does come to a head. And then it passes. 

00:12:05
DR. REID WILSON And so how would life be different if you didn't -- if you had more control and you worried when you thought it was a useful time to worry, like about your son or money or these -- or your health and -- what -- what would change? 

00:12:20
BARBARA Well, I would -- I would guess that my life would be more serene, yeah, you know. 

00:12:25
DR. REID WILSON Serene. 

00:12:25
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:12:25
DR. REID WILSON You're gonna start meditating or -- "serene" -- 

00:12:30
BARBARA Well -- 

00:12:30
DR. REID WILSON -- what does that mean to you? 

00:12:30
BARBARA It means that, um, I would have more energy and, um -- 

00:12:35
DR. REID WILSON Well, that's good. 

00:12:35
BARBARA -- to be able to, you know, address things in a -- in a more calm fashion, yeah. 

00:12:40
DR. REID WILSON  And these ideas may be new for you coz you haven't really thought about that before. But -- so "I'd have more energy." And, again, you may have just stumbled around this. Do you know what you would wanna do with the renewed energy that -- 

00:12:55
BARBARA  Well, there are certainly a lot of things that I let slide that I don't feel up to doing because I'm exhausted from all this worrying -- 

00:13:05
DR. REID WILSON But -- 

00:13:05
BARBARA -- that I don't even know I'm doing. 

00:13:05
DR. REID WILSON Well, let me just make sure that I'm askin the question that I mean to ask. What would you want -- 

00:13:10
BARBARA You mean -- 

00:13:10
DR. REID WILSON -- to be doing with that energy? 

00:13:15
BARBARA -- specific activities? 

00:13:15
DR. REID WILSON Yeah. Not like what's new on your list that you have to accomplish and -- but what would you want to do with that energy? It's gotta go somewhere. 

00:13:20
BARBARA  Hmm, I'm not quite sure. Do you mean like a specific activity -- 

00:13:25
DR. REID WILSON Yeah. 

00:13:25
BARBARA -- like playing piano or -- 

00:13:30
DR. REID WILSON Sure. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. 

00:13:30
BARBARA -- or -- or going out with friends or -- exactly. 

00:13:30
DR. REID WILSON Any of that. 

00:13:30
BARBARA Well, that would be the kind of thing I would -- 

00:13:30
DR. REID WILSON Sleeping, even, you know. 

00:13:30
BARBARA Yeah, well -- 

00:13:30
DR. REID WILSON Whatever. 

00:13:35
BARBARA Well, no, I do sleep, but I -- 

00:13:35
DR. REID WILSON Okay. Well, I -- 

00:13:35
BARBARA But, I mean -- 

00:13:35
DR. REID WILSON -- hardly know you -- 

00:13:35
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:13:35
DR. REID WILSON -- so -- 

00:13:35
BARBARA Certainly -- certainly I would -- I would probably spend more time doing things like playing piano, um, or, you know, visiting with friends, um -- 

00:13:45
DR. REID WILSON Tell me about the piano. 

00:13:50
BARBARA Oh, I've let my piano-playing go. I -- I was an accomplished pianist as a young -- younger person. Yeah. So I would spend more time with it. 

00:13:55
DR. REID WILSON  And why get back to it? 

00:14:00
BARBARA It gave me a great deal of pleasure. And, um -- and it also was relaxing, um, and it felt good. 

00:14:10
DR. REID WILSON Well, I like -- I like hearing you talk about the piano. 

00:14:10
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:14:10
DR. REID WILSON That's nice. I -- I got so caught in the piano, I didn't hear the other things that were on your -- I think you named one other thing that you would do. 

00:14:20
BARBARA Being with friends. I -- I, you know, have wonderful friends. I -- I do get see them, but not as often as I'd like. 

00:14:25
DR. REID WILSON Because of what we're talking about? 

00:14:25
BARBARA I'm not sure. I -- I think there is, you know, a lessening of energy when -- you know, and a distraction. It's -- if I'm busy thinking about or worrying about these things, I don't get to do the things I like to do. 

00:14:40
DR. REID WILSON No, that's what I want us to understand, that I think what you're thinking, which is that 'I -- I stay somewhat preoccupied with this stuff and it's kinda on me, that it's kinda -- it's a little kind of certain percentage of suffering that I'm feeling, that wouldn't that be nice if I didn't have that?' Would you really get back to playing the piano? 

00:15:00
BARBARA Oh, yeah. 

00:15:00
DR. REID WILSON Honest? 

00:15:00
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:15:00
DR. REID WILSON Oh. 

00:15:05
BARBARA There's no question. 

00:15:05
DR. REID WILSON And what would that -- how would you like that? 

00:15:05
BARBARA I think that would be very nice. I have resumed certain activities, uh, recent -- in the last several months, that, you know, feel great. And, um -- and that doesn't in turn -- it sort of balances out a little bit more my life and -- and, I think, takes away from the worry. So it would be nice to -- to -- to move more in that direction. 

00:15:25
DR. REID WILSON And what about friends? What -- what does it -- what are you missing? What do you want more of? 

00:15:30
BARBARA I -- you know, I used to spend a little bit more time with them. I'm on the phone with them periodically but, um, yeah, I don't spend as time with them as I'd like to. 

00:15:40
DR. REID WILSON Okay. So when I talk about worries, I talk about worries being signals versus worries being noise. 

00:15:50
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:15:50
DR. REID WILSON So worries that are signals are things you need to pay attention to, there's -- it's a problem that can be fixed, um, you have some responsibility for it, um, now's the time to pay attention to it. Worries that are noise would be none of my business, you know. People who are afraid to fly, who are paying attention to the sounds on the plane, you know, that's, like, none of my business, that's -- I don't have to pay attention to the sounds on the plane; that's -- that's what they do. Right? So -- so the things that are none of my business or it's a problem but there's no real answer to it, or I got a problem but I have -- I got a plan, I -- I -- a little bit like what's going on with your health issues. I -- I'm assuming that you are pretty well-organized about what you need to do around taking care of yourself. Is that right? You have -- 

00:16:35
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:16:35
DR. REID WILSON -- regular visits to -- 

00:16:40
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:16:40
DR. REID WILSON -- whatever specialist you have? 

00:16:40
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:16:40
DR. REID WILSON And yet, right, things start happening. So -- and all these topics that you have, you know, people with generalized anxiety disorder, what do they worry about? Um, work or school, family and relationships, money, health. Oh, my! That's all -- those -- those four. The last one endorsed by, like, 91% of people with generalized anxiety is they worry about minor things; they get nickeled and dimed all day. Are you -- you kind of get little worries? Things -- 

00:17:15
BARBARA I'm not really sure if I do. 

00:17:15
DR. REID WILSON Yeah, okay. Well, so -- 

00:17:15
BARBARA It's possible. I don't know. 

00:17:15
DR. REID WILSON -- that's good, coz, you know, I call these people worry-making machines. But -- 

00:17:20
BARBARA Yeah. No. 

00:17:20
DR. REID WILSON -- I wouldn't that to you, coz -- but -- but the reason I would say "worry-making machine, God, you're a worry-making machine" is what I want -- and I'd like to just hand this to you on a silver platter here, is -- the content of what you worry about is irrelevant to you and I -- 

00:17:40
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:17:40
DR. REID WILSON -- because the content of what you worry about is actually relevant to you; these things are important: paying my bills, and my money, and my son's good life and -- and my work and what I do and being secure in that, and my health. Those are all legitimate. So those are signals that sometimes I need to be paying attention to it. What is -- what we want to address is, okay, in what way am I in control of that? You know what worries -- what's the function of worry? Do you have -- 

00:18:10
BARBARA No. 

00:18:10
DR. REID WILSON -- a sense? 

00:18:10
BARBARA Unh-unh. 

00:18:10
DR. REID WILSON Do you want to give a guess why people worry? 

00:18:15
BARBARA  I'm not really sure. 

00:18:20
DR. REID WILSON It reminds you to do things, right? 

00:18:20
BARBARA Well, yeah, it was a thought. 

00:18:20
DR. REID WILSON Have I taken -- did I -- 

00:18:20
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:18:20
DR. REID WILSON -- you know, put my pills in the order, have I done that yet; did I call him yet. Um, it sort of organizes you, it motivates you, unless you're procrastin -- I mean, procrastination will put it off, but it does motivate you to get -- 

00:18:35
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:18:35
DR. REID WILSON -- things star -- kind of -- but it -- its primary function is to kick-start the problem-solving process, it's to go, you know, 'Oh, there's an issue.' So, you know, this -- this week I've written a number of notes to myself; I go, 'Don't wanna forget that. Write it down.' I'll address it later, I'll handle it later, but the worry is to bring this to my attention. So what we want to distinguish is, when a worry pops up, are you able to step back, notice it and decide is this a signal or this is noise, right? 

00:19:15
BARBARA Uh-huh. 

00:19:15
DR. REID WILSON So -- so now let's -- let's talk about some of them. So you're worrying about your son? 

00:19:20
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:19:20
DR. REID WILSON  When would you think a worry about your son would be a signal, meaning 'I -- there's something I need to do,' or 'I got -- wanted to remind him of something,' or 'I wanna put out good vibes towards him, I wanna say a little prayer for' -- I -- when do you think the issues around your son trying to change jobs and so forth would be -- that worry would be a signal for you? 

00:19:50
BARBARA I think, pretty much on a daily basis. 

00:19:50
DR. REID WILSON So tell me how -- why. What would you -- what responsibilities -- 

00:19:55
BARBARA Well, on a daily basis I will think, 'Oh, you know, I wonder how he's doing today. Um, he probably needs somebody to say hi.' 

00:20:00
DR. REID WILSON Uh, time out. No, no, no, no. 

00:20:00
BARBARA Nope, nope, nope. 

00:20:05
DR. REID WILSON Let's back up. 

00:20:05
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:20:05
DR. REID WILSON Let's -- let's define worry again -- 

00:20:05
BARBARA Yes. 

00:20:05
DR. REID WILSON -- because it sounds like you're talking about worry that is noise. 

00:20:10
BARBARA It does? 

00:20:10
DR. REID WILSON There's nothing for you to do about that. You're just -- that doesn't kick you into action that is important for your son. Does it? Am I misunderstanding you? You -- you operate like it's a signal, right? 

00:20:25
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:20:25
DR. REID WILSON Oh, everyday it's a signal. Not talking you operating like a signal. I'm saying let's you and I step back for a moment right now and go 'When is it helpful to my son for me to have a worried thought about what's going on for him?', coz he's trying to get a new job and --when would that be useful? 

00:20:45
BARBARA  Um, well, my -- I don't know. Maybe -- maybe when he's, um, in crisis, or maybe when he's particularly distressed. 

00:20:55
DR. REID WILSON  How would you know about whether he's in crisis or not? 

00:21:00
BARBARA Well, if he called or if I -- 

00:21:00
DR. REID WILSON Okay. 

00:21:00
BARBARA -- I called him. 

00:21:05
DR. REID WILSON Uh-huh. 

00:21:05
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:21:05
DR. REID WILSON Okay. So -- okay, great. So, you know, here's a motto that I would want to offer you: Anything that's worth worrying about is worth problem-solving. Okay? 

00:21:15
BARBARA Okay. 

00:21:15
DR. REID WILSON So you could say, 'Oh, gosh, I hope he's okay. I'm gonna call him tonight and just check in, see how he's doing. And if he doesn't -- unless I've been intruding too much and he's annoyed with me, let me just call in and see -- you know, mother's intuition.' 

00:21:30
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:21:30
DR. REID WILSON  So that would be havin a worry and going ahead and acting on it -- 

00:21:35
BARBARA Right. 

00:21:35
DR. REID WILSON -- or going, you know, 'I just talked to him last night, and I already know nothing's happening here and I don't really' --okay. So -- 

00:21:45
BARBARA Right. 

00:21:45
DR. REID WILSON -- how are we doing around understanding signal versus -- coz what happens in your mind is you're not making that distinction. 

00:21:50
BARBARA  No, I don't make a distinction. 

00:21:55
DR. REID WILSON Everything is a signal. 

00:21:55
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:21:55
DR. REID WILSON And you suffer. 

00:21:55
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:21:55
DR. REID WILSON So, we've got -- all we have in this limited time, you and I together, is to get a -- a couple little principles that you can run with. And what I've offered you is that twice we'll have a consultation on the telephone after this to follow-through, coz I'd like us to create some kind of homework for you that can we -- that we'll follow-through on. Is that okay with you? 

00:22:20
BARBARA Sure. 

00:22:20
DR. REID WILSON Okay. So how are we doing around worry versus -- so we've got signal versus noise. And you said one signal is your son would be -- 'If I know in some way he's distressed or he called last night in distress and I want to check in with him today,' that would be a signal. 

00:22:35
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:22:35
DR. REID WILSON Any other way that -- that you would think of a -- a worry about your son would be a signal? Any other time that a worry about your son would be a signal? 

00:22:45
BARBARA Um, I don't think so. 

00:22:50
DR. REID WILSON Okay. Or if you haven't -- so, again I would just say, if you haven't checked in with him for a while and you want to check in, you just -- 

00:22:55
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:22:55
DR. REID WILSON -- call him up and -- 

00:22:55
BARBARA Right. 

00:22:55
DR. REID WILSON -- 'How you doing?' 

00:22:55
BARBARA If I didn't hear from him -- 

00:22:55
DR. REID WILSON Yeah. 

00:22:55
BARBARA -- for several days. 

00:22:55
DR. REID WILSON Do you talk -- is it okay with you that you call? 

00:23:00
BARBARA Most of the time. 

00:23:00
DR. REID WILSON Most of the time. Well, we can clean that up, coz you could -- 

00:23:00
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:23:00
DR. REID WILSON -- call him less frequently, I guess. 

00:23:05
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:23:05
DR. REID WILSON So what are you going to -- what would you do with all the other worries about your son when they pop up? 

00:23:10
BARBARA Let them go. 

00:23:10
DR. REID WILSON How would you do that? 

00:23:15
BARBARA Self-talk. 

00:23:15
DR. REID WILSON What would you say? 

00:23:15
BARBARA  I would say, 'Stop worrying. He's okay. He's -- he's not a kid anymore. He's -- you know, have faith in his ability to handle it and, uh -- and if he can't, well, that's his path and his journey'. 

00:23:30
DR. REID WILSON Do you already do that to yourself? 

00:23:35
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:23:35
DR. REID WILSON And how's that going? 

00:23:35
BARBARA  Pretty good. Yeah. 

00:23:40
DR. REID WILSON I don't see anything wrong with that strategy. I think -- 

00:23:45
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:23:45
DR. REID WILSON -- that's fine if you say those things to yourself, but there's some reason that it's not working. Do you have a sense of what -- so what's the other voice that pops up to compete with it? 

00:23:50
BARBARA I think it -- a lot of it depends on how secure I'm feeling in myself during the course of a day or a week. If I'm feeling, you know, really grounded and everything's going okay, then I don't worry as much. 

00:24:05
DR. REID WILSON Oh, that's great. I like that a lot. 

00:24:05
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:24:05
DR. REID WILSON So what you're saying is, 'Wait a minute, this is about me right now. I'm having a -- I'm getting a signal that I'm hearing I -- you know, I need to worry about him. But wait a minute, I'm misinterpreting the signal.' 

00:24:20
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:24:20
DR. REID WILSON 'This is about me.' 

00:24:20
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:24:20
DR. REID WILSON 'And I'm feeling insecure about something about myself.' And how -- listen to this question: How do you feel about feeling insecure? 

00:24:30
BARBARA I -- I'm tempted to say, 'Well, how does anybody feel?' But, um, I -- you know, obviously it's not a good feeling. But again -- 

00:24:35
DR. REID WILSON  Well, how do you feel about -- and I know it's not a good feeling. How you feel -- what's your opinion about noticing that you feel insecure? 

00:24:45
BARBARA What's my opinion about it? 

00:24:45
DR. REID WILSON Yeah. Is that okay? 

00:24:50
BARBARA Well, no. It's not okay to not feel secure. Um, I think you first have -- I shouldn't say "you". I think I would probably first have to be in touch with the fact that I'm not feeling good about myself. 

00:25:05
DR. REID WILSON Oh, and you know what we're talking about doing. 'When my worry about my son pops up, I step back for a moment and go "Is this a signal, or is this noise" -- 

00:25:20
BARBARA Is this noise. 

00:25:20
DR. REID WILSON -- "regarding my son?"' Now, we're adding a piece here, "regarding my son" -- 

00:25:25
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:25:25
DR. REID WILSON -- because it may be a signal for you: I'm feeling insecure. But it's not a signal about your son. So when you keep going down the path of "This is a signal about my son," you're mistreating yourself, so to speak, coz you're not on the right topic. 

00:25:40
BARBARA It's very interesting what you're saying to me -- 

00:25:45
DR. REID WILSON Why? 

00:25:45
BARBARA Because -- because I'm realizing that, um, many times I'm feeling unworthy or I'm feeling -- you know, those old feelings crop up that -- that say, you know, 'You're not okay.' And -- and there is a connection apparently. 

00:26:00
DR. REID WILSON Very -- very good. 

00:26:00
BARBARA  And I didn't realize that, uh -- 

00:26:05
DR. REID WILSON No, very good. 

00:26:05
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:26:05
DR. REID WILSON You got that very -- that's -- that's very powerful, right? And so -- 

00:26:10
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:26:10
DR. REID WILSON -- that's what were saying about trying clean things up. So we're not up here going, 'Don't worry. Don't worry. Stop worrying.' 

00:26:15
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:26:20
DR. REID WILSON You say that enough to yourself, and probably other people do. Your family does too -- 

00:26:20
BARBARA Yes. 

00:26:20
DR. REID WILSON -- right? 

00:26:20
BARBARA Oh, yes. Everybody tells me. 

00:26:20
DR. REID WILSON So it's not about that. 

00:26:20
BARBARA Yeah. Right. 

00:26:20
DR. REID WILSON It's, like, what -- so where you and I are going, not some kind of formula, but for you right now it's like, Oh, well, wait a minute. Maybe a lot of my worry is a signal. But let me pick up on the signal.' Now, I'm gonna -- I'm gonna give you a friendly amendment about what you said about your insecurity. So let's -- I'm just going to -- I mean, I'm your consultant, so you can throw this away later on. But I would consider the possibility of being okay that you feel insecure. 

00:26:55
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:26:55
DR. REID WILSON 'It's okay that I feel insecure.' 

00:26:55
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:26:55
DR. REID WILSON Do you really have to get rid of feeling of insecure? How's that going anyway? Right? There's, what -- you know, good luck on that. I mean, I'm an insecure person. And so do you have to make it not okay that you're insecure? So here we go, we have a signal; it pops up: 'Oh, I gotta call. You know, I hope he's okay. Okay, so wait a minute, let me just see.' Now, I wanna give you a little secret around this. To -- you got the "signal and noise" idea, right? 

00:27:25
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:27:25
DR. REID WILSON So in the moment, if you have a worry pop up and you step back to determine whether it's a signal or a noise, you've just separated yourself from your worry, which is what you and I want to accomplish. Don't want my worry running me ragged. I wanna separate a little bit. So simply the decision, 'Is this a signal or is this noise? Or what's this? Is it really about him?' You know the fear-of-flying thing -- example. 

00:27:50
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:27:50
DR. REID WILSON 'Oh, it's -- I hear the pallet. You know, something just boomed down' -- that's a signal. What's it a signal of? It's a signal that I'm not feeling in control being on this plane. That's -- that's the signal, right? So -- 

00:28:05
BARBARA Uh-huh. 

00:28:05
DR. REID WILSON Right? So, now -- so we're doing a little complex thing here where you're goin, 'Okay, it's a signal, but maybe it's a signal about me feeling insecure.' And then I'm adding -- I'm -- I'm making a suggestion to you to consider 'I actually don't have to do anything about the fact that I'm feeling insecure right now, other than acknowledge it and be okay with it.' 

00:28:25
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:28:25
DR. REID WILSON What would that be like for you, if you'd just try it on for a moment or so? 

00:28:30
BARBARA Oh, I think that would be great. I think one of the keys that I just heard from you to helping me work this out is that when I find myself worrying, first distinguishing whether it's noise or, you know, something I have to do something about, and then -- and then realizing that -- that that signal is signaling something about me, coz very often I'm not in touch with, 'Oh, I don't feel so well about myself,' or 'I don't feel so happy with who I am today,' or whatever. 

00:28:55
DR. REID WILSON  Well, who wants to get in touch with that anyway? 

00:29:00
BARBARA So I -- I don't realize, you know -- yeah. 

00:29:05
DR. REID WILSON Listen, Barbara, it's a universal experience. 

00:29:10
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:29:10
DR. REID WILSON Who wants to get in touch with that? 

00:29:10
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:29:10
DR. REID WILSON Right? So it is a difficult piece, but it would really be a good idea to know if that's what's happening to you -- 

00:29:15
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:29:20
DR. REID WILSON -- that you do it. Now, what do you think about the idea of being okay with noticing that right at this moment, this -- coz this is what we wanna do with worry is get into the present moment. 

00:29:30
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:29:30
DR. REID WILSON And this present moment, as we clean it up, is 'I'm feeling insecure.' What do you think about going,'I -- I can handle' -- 

00:29:40
BARBARA Oh, yeah. 

00:29:40
DR. REID WILSON -- 'feeling insecure'? What would that do in the moment if you did that? 

00:29:45
BARBARA Oh, I think it would lift a lot of burden from me. I -- you know, the kind of thing I would tell my clients is, you know, 'It's okay not to feel okay. You know, it's -- that's -- you know, you can -- you can live through that,' and whatever. 

00:30:00
DR. REID WILSON But what you were asking for earlier was 'I want to feel serene -- 

00:30:00
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:30:05
DR. REID WILSON -- and calm. Does that move you in that direction? 

00:30:05
BARBARA Oh, yeah. 

00:30:05
DR. REID WILSON Could you actually be serene about feeling insecure? I mean -- 

00:30:10
BARBARA Oh, yeah. 

00:30:10
DR. REID WILSON -- conceptually, can you imagine that? 

00:30:10
BARBARA Yeah, I could be. I could be, if I knew I wasn't feeling -- so, yeah, definitely. So it sounds almost like my worrying is actually, um, a good tool to use, it's a good signal. 

00:30:25
DR. REID WILSON Yeah. 

00:30:25
BARBARA I -- I didn't -- 

00:30:25
DR. REID WILSON Okay. 

00:30:25
BARBARA -- realize that. 

00:30:25
DR. REID WILSON And, now, you gave me an expression; you said, 'Well I could let it go.' 

00:30:30
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:30:30
DR. REID WILSON Right? And so what -- what do you think letting go means? Coz where you went was 'I could let it go, I could tell myself this, I could' -- or, you know, remind myself this, I could' -- 

00:30:40
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:30:40
DR. REID WILSON So what do you -- can you make up a definition of -- of that term "letting go"? What would you say it means, generically? 

00:30:50
BARBARA Yeah, um, I think I would take a deep breath and just move on with whatever it is that I want to do for the day or, you know, whatever I -- whatever's on my agenda, and -- and sort of just put it on the shelf, you know, just say 'Okay,' you know, for now it's' -- 

00:31:05
DR. REID WILSON Okay. 

00:31:05
BARBARA -- 'okay.' 

00:31:05
DR. REID WILSON Okay. I'm gonna give you a friendly amendment -- 

00:31:05
BARBARA Yeah? 

00:31:10
DR. REID WILSON -- if that's okay with you -- 

00:31:10
BARBARA Sure. 

00:31:10
DR. REID WILSON -- coz I -- I like what you're sayin, but -- you said 'I'm gonna take a breath.' And then when letting go, is 'I'm gonna be with it for four or five seconds, floating on that exhale. I'm just going to sit there for a moment, acknowledge it, give it some positive space. I'm feeling insecure. Okay, fine.' And then just get a sense 'Do I like I feel like I need to -- should I -- does it feel like I wanna get on with my day right now? What -- what do I feel like I wanna -- I wanna do right now?' You can see if there's any other signals that, you know, as you let yourself be calm, you know, about your foibles or, you know -- 

00:31:45
BARBARA Right. 

00:31:45
DR. REID WILSON -- just -- and see how that goes. Is that amendment okay with you? 

00:31:50
BARBARA Sure. 

00:31:50
DR. REID WILSON So -- 

00:31:50
BARBARA Yes. 

00:31:50
DR. REID WILSON So we can also think about letting go means not embellishing it -- 

00:31:55
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:31:55
DR. REID WILSON -- right? So the thought about your son, 'Oh, is he okay?', step back and notice it instead of run with it, that's a letting-go; 'I'm not gonna get involved with it right now. Let me just check it out, see what's goin on.' Let's talk about the finances, coz you got this thing around procrastination and shifting things around. Let's see if we can do anything with what we've just been talking about, and let's shift to what I think is a more difficult issue with you where you're shifting around and procrastinating, so forth. Just off the top of your head, anything come up around how you might apply some of this to that scenes? Even if you can't do it, let's just -- 

00:32:40
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:32:40
DR. REID WILSON --see what you -- 

00:32:40
BARBARA Well -- 

00:32:40
DR. REID WILSON -- think hypothetically. 

00:32:40
BARBARA -- I guess -- again, I -- I'm a big believer in self-talk. I guess I could give myself a bit of a talking-to, because this is -- 

00:32:50
DR. REID WILSON Coz it works so well about -- you worry about your son, might as well try it for this. 

00:32:50
BARBARA Well, not just that. 

00:32:50
DR. REID WILSON And I'm sure you don't do self-talk -- 

00:32:55
BARBARA Historically -- 

00:32:55
DR. REID WILSON -- already. 

00:32:55
BARBARA Yeah. No, historically, I do always get to those things. Once in a blue moon I have to pay a late charge. But for the most part, I -- you know, historically, I get to them. But I get to them with such, as I say, angst. It's like, 'Oh my God.' You know, finally four o'clock in the morning I'm on doing my online banking, or whatever. 

00:33:10
DR. REID WILSON So what's coming to your mind now about that? 

00:33:15
BARBARA So, um, maybe, again, just saying this is not necessary to do, you know, you can do this differently, you don't have to worry about this, it's -- 

00:33:25
DR. REID WILSON Okay, so -- 

00:33:25
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:33:25
DR. REID WILSON -- what thought would be popping up that you would respond to like that? Let's take an example. So you'd -- you'd think what? 

00:33:35
BARBARA The thought that -- you mean initial thought? 

00:33:35
DR. REID WILSON What would be the -- a worry that would pop up that you would respond to like that? 

00:33:40
BARBARA 'Oh my God, look how many bills are coming in this month. O my God, the bills have gone up because it's wintertime and, you know, and that' -- 

00:33:45
DR. REID WILSON Okay, so now you're going to -- now -- 

00:33:45
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:33:45
DR. REID WILSON -- if we were doing this particular kind of model, okay. you're going to step back for a minute and go, 'I'm hearing myself get all tangled up in here.' 

00:33:55
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:33:55
DR. REID WILSON 'And --and so I'm gonna step back and go "signal or noise"?' Is it a signal or noise at this moment? 

00:34:00
BARBARA  I don't know. I think it's a signal that I should do something, no? 

00:34:05
DR. REID WILSON  Oh. Okay. So anything that's worth worrying about -- 

00:34:10
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:34:10
DR. REID WILSON -- is worth problem-solving. 

00:34:15
BARBARA Okay. 

00:34:15
DR. REID WILSON So the worry about the bills is a signal unless you're not interested in doing anything about it at that moment, you're just gonna worry and then it's noise, you see. 

00:34:25
BARBARA Uh-huh. 

00:34:25
DR. REID WILSON So I either -- I either go -- I either treat it as a signal -- what's that mean when you treat something as a signal? What do you do? 

00:34:35
BARBARA You do something about it. 

00:34:35
DR. REID WILSON You -- you problem-solve. 

00:34:35
BARBARA Yeah, right. 

00:34:35
DR. REID WILSON I mean, you're either gonna treat it as a signal, or I'm gonna operate as though it's noise at this moment. Right? 

00:34:45
BARBARA Right. 

00:34:45
DR. REID WILSON So it's not -- you know, if you wake up at three in the morning worried about your bills, it's almost always, not -- not a 100%, almost always noise, because three in the morning, you have decided, is sleep time. So even though an issue comes up at three in the morning about the bills, you go -- you know, you may write it down, "Got up to think about that," and then you wanna go, 'Putting it away,' put it on the floor, see that note in the morning, now I get back to sleep. So -- so you have that worry about money, and then you go, 'Oh yeah, it's a signal.' What do you wanna do when you have a signal about money? So we'll just take it moment by moment. You got a moment where it pops up, it is a signal, 'I haven't paid the bills.' You wanna shift it over to noise at that moment, which is okay to do, or do you wanna take action on it? 

00:35:35
BARBARA Yeah, you have to -- I made the decision. 

00:35:40
DR. REID WILSON Yeah. 

00:35:40
BARBARA But it's funny; as you're talking, uh, Dr. Wilson -- 

00:35:40
DR. REID WILSON That was a question to you, though. 

00:35:40
BARBARA Oh, you're asking me? 

00:35:40
DR. REID WILSON But you go ahead and answer -- no, that's okay. 

00:35:40
BARBARA Because my mind was somewhere else already. 

00:35:45
DR. REID WILSON No, go ahead. Go ahead. I'll get that -- 

00:35:45
BARBARA I'm sorry. 

00:35:45
DR. REID WILSON I know what that question is. Go -- tell what you were going to say. 

00:35:50
BARBARA Yeah, okay. Yeah, please bring me back to that question -- 

00:35:50
DR. REID WILSON I will. 

00:35:50
BARBARA -- because my mind went ahead. 

00:35:50
DR. REID WILSON No, I want to follow you. 

00:35:50
BARBARA And I'm thinking to myself what ha -- it's so funny is that when I decide 'Okay, this is noise,' or I don't -- I never used that terminology before. But when I decide 'Okay, I'm not gonna do anything about this worry,' then I beat myself up for being a procrastinator. It's like -- 

00:36:05
DR. REID WILSON Okay, so -- 

00:36:05
BARBARA -- 'How could you be so inefficient?' 

00:36:10
DR. REID WILSON -- that doesn't work. 

00:36:10
BARBARA Right. Yeah. 

00:36:10
DR. REID WILSON That doesn't work. 

00:36:10
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:36:10
DR. REID WILSON So let's see if we can be creative. You don't have to act on -- you know, we can just -- let's play around with it and see what you come up with later on you can do something else with. So -- so the worry pops up, 'Oh boy, I haven't paid my bills yet, and I put it -- and yesterday I said I was going to today, and I didn't get around to it. Now it's 11 o'clock at night.' How do you turn it in -- what would you have to do to turn it in -- to operate like it's a signal? What would you have to do at that moment? 

00:36:35
BARBARA Remember our conversation perhaps. 

00:36:40
DR. REID WILSON Okay. 

00:36:40
BARBARA I don't know. 

00:36:40
DR. REID WILSON But if -- so here we go; the worry pops up about money. 

00:36:45
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:36:45
DR. REID WILSON If you wanna operate like it's a signal, what are your options at that point, would you think? 

00:36:50
BARBARA I could go ahead and pay them then. I -- coz I have the option, I -- it's online banking, so I have -- yeah. 

00:36:55
DR. REID WILSON Okay. So at any particular moment you could say, 'Okay, well, now, anything that's worth worrying about, it's worth problem-solving. I’m going to go' -- 

00:37:00
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:37:00
DR. REID WILSON -- go ahead do it now.' 

00:37:05
BARBARA Right. 

00:37:05
DR. REID WILSON And -- and what would -- what goes in your head that go -- 'Nah, I don't think so. Nah'? 

00:37:10
BARBARA 'I'm tired,' you know. 

00:37:15
DR. REID WILSON Yeah. Okay -- 

00:37:15
BARBARA 'Poor me.' 

00:37:15
DR. REID WILSON Right. Okay, so -- 

00:37:15
BARBARA 'I'm stuck with all these' -- 

00:37:15
DR. REID WILSON So here -- 

00:37:15
BARBARA -- 'responsibilities.' 

00:37:15
DR. REID WILSON So here's how it goes: You -- 

00:37:20
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:37:20
DR. REID WILSON -- Barbara, make a commitment which has action, right? Make it -- 'I'm going to pay my bills.' It's got action. And in between the commitment and the action is your feeling: 'I'm gonna pay my bills now. Gosh, I'm feeling tired. I think I'll rest for a little bit.' Eh, no action, right? So -- 

00:37:45
BARBARA Right. 

00:37:45
DR. REID WILSON -- the formula, if we could think about it, is, if I make a commitment -- 

00:37:50
BARBARA Yeah? 

00:37:50
DR. REID WILSON -- I got feelings, 'Uh, I really feel tired.' 'Well, isn't that interesting?' Take my action. So that in this little formula, you notice your feelings; you don't get influenced by your feeling. Doesn't matter whether you're tired or that you don't think you can concentrate, you might make a mistake, whatever. If you make a commitment to do something, you notice your feelings, take the action, look at your feelings when you finished. That's where you want your feelings to -- to pay attention to. So if you go, 'You know, I've worried about this enough. I'm gonna act right at this moment. Eh, I'm kinda tired. I'm not sure I really wanna do it right now. Oh, that's interesting.' Then you go and you pay bills for 15 minutes, and now you check into your emotions. What do you imagine you're going to be feeling at that point. 

00:38:45
BARBARA Relief. 

00:38:45
DR. REID WILSON So you'll -- 

00:38:45
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:38:45
DR. REID WILSON Is that something you're looking for? 

00:38:50
BARBARA Yes. 

00:38:50
DR. REID WILSON Okay. So the feelings in the middle are, I think, if we can conclude, are like your insecurity. Notice your feelings, right? And here, though -- I mean, if you wanna say, 'Well, I'll solve that problem in a little bit,' or whatever you want to do, but it's a little like the insecurity: 'Okay, I notice them. Don't have to do anything about them. Let me go into action.' So I know that's, you know, a miracle if you could just do that like that, unless you remember me going like that and then you'll do it. So -- pretend you're in deep trance. Do that. Okay, so -- 

00:39:25
BARBARA That's what I was thinking: hypnosis. 

00:39:25
DR. REID WILSON Yeah. Okay. Is there another way to respond to a signal about the money, paying the bills? 

00:39:35
BARBARA Well, your way makes a lot of sense. 

00:39:40
DR. REID WILSON Okay. But there -- there's several things to do; like, you could schedule something, like you've done before, but really actually -- you can go 'Okay. You know, I'm gonna put it in my calendar now, and then I'm gonna do it then.' But then you'd have to do the same thing, which is, 'Got a commitment. It's 5:30. I said I'm gonna do it. You know, I got three calls.' I mean, we all do this. I go to write and then I go, 'Well, let me just check my e-mail for -- I'll give 10 -- 10 minutes of e-mail, and then I'll start writing.' 

00:40:10
BARBARA Ah, yeah. 

00:40:10
DR. REID WILSON And then there's so many interesting things, and I'm checking off a list of a bunch of things, and I'm accomplishing a lot of things. You know, paying the bills is a lot tougher than checking off all the -- and all of a sudden, time has gone by and I need another cup of caffeine, or something. So -- 

00:40:25
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:40:25
DR. REID WILSON So it's gonna happen. Well, let's -- is there anything else you wanna do? But let's talk about the health a little -- 

00:40:30
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:40:30
DR. REID WILSON -- bit. 

00:40:30
BARBARA Okay. 

00:40:30
DR. REID WILSON Is that a more difficult pro -- we've talked about your son and we talked about money, and there's the health thing, and more? 

00:40:40
BARBARA I would say that it's -- it's a very huge issue in my life, yeah. 

00:40:45
DR. REID WILSON And what about the worry part? Is it -- 

00:40:45
BARBARA Um -- 

00:40:45
DR. REID WILSON How is it ranking of these three? 

00:40:50
BARBARA Well, It's interesting, coz the illnesses that I have -- the diseases I have actually are exacerbated by stress. It's not a good thing to be stressed, you know, and -- 

00:41:00
DR. REID WILSON Uh-huh. 

00:41:00
BARBARA -- so it's very self-defeating to get into a worry-state over them, because it only makes worse. Uh, so -- 

00:41:10
DR. REID WILSON And do you have any choice, as we're kind of trying to develop a little model here? 

00:41:15
BARBARA Well, I -- I've already, you know, come to the conclusion that my worry is based on fear and, you know -- and that fear is something that is very difficult to deal with. Um, so I -- again, I tell myself, you know, it is what it is and, you know -- 

00:41:30
DR. REID WILSON But what -- um, back up. What's gonna set off that worry about -- 

00:41:35
BARBARA A symptom. 

00:41:35
DR. REID WILSON Okay. And -- and is that appropriate? 

00:41:40
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:41:40
DR. REID WILSON Okay. And you have old symptoms that you understand, you know what they're about, and so forth? 

00:41:45
BARBARA Yeah. Um-hum. 

00:41:45
DR. REID WILSON And you wanna react to them in the same way you do a brand-new symptom? 

00:41:50
BARBARA Well, I try to distinguish, you know. It's not always -- 

00:41:50
DR. REID WILSON But -- 

00:41:50
BARBARA --easy. 

00:41:55
DR. REID WILSON But that is a distinction that you want to make? 

00:41:55
BARBARA Yes. 

00:41:55
DR. REID WILSON 'An old signal, there, that.' 

00:41:55
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:41:55
DR. REID WILSON 'I know that one; it's coming up as a' -- they all come up as signals. All your worries -- 'All my worries come up as signals.' They've grabbed your attention. And then you have to step back and decide 'Do I need to act on this new symptom? What do I need to do?' So part of it is, like, 'Oh, well, I'll make another appointment, or I'll track it for the next three days.' But you can do that with serenity. You can fool around with going -- it's like if you're late somewhere, you know, and you have to drive fast. You don't have to drive fast and be anxious; you just have to drive fast. 

00:42:40
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:42:40
DR. REID WILSON Right? You don't have to -- you don't have to be squeezing your, you know, hands on the steering wheel. You can -- you can loosen your -- 

00:42:45
BARBARA Right. 

00:42:45
DR. REID WILSON -- your grip and go fast if you want. You can actually put a smile on your face. You can put a pencil in your mouth and bite it. 

00:42:55
BARBARA You can. 

00:42:55
DR. REID WILSON Well, I mean, that'll turn your lips up -- 

00:42:55
BARBARA Right. 

00:42:55
DR. REID WILSON -- and you'll begin to -- 

00:42:55
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:42:55
DR. REID WILSON -- change things -- 

00:43:00
BARBARA It's like whistle a happy tune. 

00:43:00
DR. REID WILSON So we -- we could. So -- but the same thing around the symptoms. 

00:43:05
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:43:05
DR. REID WILSON You gotta decide -- 

00:43:05
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:43:05
DR. REID WILSON -- coz the symptoms are gonna grab your attention coz you got enough of them going on; you're gonna say, 'Well, signal or noise?', right? 

00:43:15
BARBARA Um-hum. Right. 

00:43:15
DR. REID WILSON So how will you know when something is noise when it has to do with your physical health? What -- what's your sense about that? 

00:43:20
BARBARA I -- I usually know. I usually know, coz I -- I am touch with that. Uh, but I -- again, if I'm feeling in a good place or, you know, things are going well, then I can differentiate, you know, between the sympt -- the symptoms. 

00:43:40
DR. REID WILSON Oh, so we don't need to talk about when you're feeling in a good place, then? 

00:43:40
BARBARA Well, I think not. I think, when I'm in a good place, I -- 

00:43:45
DR. REID WILSON I mean, you were just talking about when you're in a bad place. 

00:43:45
BARBARA When I'm -- yeah, and when I'm not -- which is not always something I'm in touch with. But -- but if I'm not in a good place, you know, emotionally, mentally, whatever, then a symptom can be scary even when it's not, if that makes sense, you know, even when I know -- 

00:44:00
DR. REID WILSON What do we think of that? 

00:44:00
BARBARA -- on some level that it's not serious. Hmm? 

00:44:05
DR. REID WILSON So what do we think of that? 'When I'm not in a good place, I misinterpret what's going on inside me' -- 

00:44:10
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:44:10
DR. REID WILSON -- 'as I worry about a physical symptom'? 

00:44:15
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:44:15
DR. REID WILSON Now, what can I do about -- what does that tell us that I want to do at those moments? 

00:44:20
BARBARA Step back. 

00:44:20
DR. REID WILSON Well, I mean, is it similar to your -- 

00:44:20
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:44:20
DR. REID WILSON -- son -- worry about your son? 

00:44:25
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:44:25
DR. REID WILSON So we've got another example, a huge example -- 

00:44:25
BARBARA Right. 

00:44:25
DR. REID WILSON -- my physical health -- 

00:44:25
BARBARA Right. 

00:44:25
DR. REID WILSON -- that when I feel like I'm not in a good place physically, emotion -- I mean emotionally or psychologically, I divert that attention over to my physical. So, now, I do have another question about that, which, you know, is "Why?" Why -- why not -- how -- how has it happened, if you know or if you can make a guess, that the concerns you have, which seem to be where we get to, about 'my security' or 'how I'm doing' and so forth, you divert your attention away from those? Do we have any clue about how come that's happening, why are you not going to those directly? 

00:45:10
BARBARA Maybe that I'm not in touch, uh, or -- you know. I don't know. I guess -- 

00:45:20
DR. REID WILSON But you understand theoretically we'd want to -- 

00:45:20
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:45:20
DR. REID WILSON You know, we'd go, 'Well, how come -- why -- you know, when I'm feeling uncomfortable about myself' -- 

00:45:25
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:45:25
DR. REID WILSON -- 'why am I not just' -- 

00:45:25
BARBARA 'Why don't I just' -- 

00:45:25
DR. REID WILSON -- 'uh, notice' -- 

00:45:25
BARBARA -- 'do something about that?' 

00:45:25
DR. REID WILSON No, 'Why am I not noticing that initially, why am I noticing' -- 

00:45:30
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:45:30
DR. REID WILSON -- 'these other things?' So I -- you know -- 

00:45:30
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:45:30
DR. REID WILSON -- I don't think we're going to have necessarily an answer to that today, but I think that would be something to be going -- 

00:45:40
BARBARA Yeah, that's actually very good, I think, uh, to look at. 

00:45:40
DR. REID WILSON Why -- why do you think -- /pa> 

00:45:45
BARBARA Yeah. I would think that, you know, there's a certain amount of, you know, conditioning that goes on in the course of on one's life, you know, things that happen as you're a child. I mean, I -- I know personally that I pretty much learned not to, um, pay much attention to myself, you know, that I -- it was not necessary to -- that it was not a good thing, you know. So I understand -- what you're saying actually makes -- resonates with me. I understand what you're saying. 

00:46:10
DR. REID WILSON Okay, so I'm going to add one thing to it, and it's a huge piece that we haven't talked about that yet -- 

00:46:15
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:46:15
DR. REID WILSON -- so it's -- but it's time to talk about that, which is, which is, if you are truly a worrier -- 

00:46:20
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:46:20
DR. REID WILSON -- then what you do is you is you avoid instead of approach. Right? So what you and I want be shaping, which we're doing, is how do you approach instead of avoid. So you've been approaching the topic now, 'my physical ailments' and that kind of thing, which is an avoidance of the true thing that you need to approach, which is, you know, these more nebulous things or, you know, how am I doing emotionally, or my insecurity about changing jo -- all that kind -- you want to identify the money, the family, all those kind of things, 'As I approach those in my worry, how am I using them to avoid approaching something else?' And we're touching upon today, as we talk about it, maybe the approach -- the avoidance is about something -- 

00:47:20
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:47:20
DR. REID WILSON I would guess. 

00:47:20
BARBARA Something else. 

00:47:20
DR. REID WILSON Maybe I go, 'Oh, I don't' -- 

00:47:20
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:47:20
DR. REID WILSON -- 'don't know what to do' -- 

00:47:20
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:47:20
DR. REID WILSON -- 'if I really pay attention to that.' So that would be something you might want to be exploring with somebody. And -- so the thing you would not approach would be something that you perceive is very large, a big challenge, and you perceive you having minimal skills to face the challenge. So you perceive the challenge large and you perceive your skills to be minimal. So somewhere along the way, you've decided 'I don't want to be paying attention to this part of me, because it seems too big and I -- I can't do anything about it.' Right? 

00:47:55
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:47:55
DR. REID WILSON So if you're going to approach that, you have to -- oh, you like the "have to" part? 

00:48:00
BARBARA  I don't mind. 

00:48:05
DR. REID WILSON Okay. I'm gonna suggest you should want to -- 

00:48:05
BARBARA  Yes? 

00:48:10
DR. REID WILSON How's that? 

00:48:10
BARBARA Fine. 

00:48:10
DR. REID WILSON What -- 

00:48:10
BARBARA Good. 

00:48:10
DR. REID WILSON What I have found works best. 

00:48:15
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:48:15
DR. REID WILSON When you, uh, approach a challenge like that is that you seek out being clumsy, awkward, unsure, insecure, that you seek those out. Those are the feelings to go along with exploring something that you're not sure you can maser. So you -- if you're gonna do this, you gotta be -- you know, when you say, 'Oh boy, I'm really feeling insecure,' okay, fine. You know, one is just to be okay with it, and then the other is to go 'Okay, go and -- what am I being insecure about and in what way can I get toward that?' 

00:48:55
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:48:55
DR. REID WILSON The work with worry is to create an understanding of the problem in such a way as you go toward it instead of away from it. All right? So you'd go toward paying your bills, you'd go toward your sense of insecurity, and whatever else we might be picking up, or -- do we have a couple minutes? Take a couple of minutes to talk about work thing and this shift and tell me a little -- 

00:49:20
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:49:20
DR. REID WILSON -- give me just a moment or two about that issue. 

00:49:25
BARBARA I've been on a little hiatus. I haven't done much in the way of work the last couple of years, because of health issues. I decided that something I've always wanted to do and which is very dear to my heart is to run groups, and, um, more -- more than independ -- you know, individual stuff. I -- I love group -- facilitating groups. Um, and I'm -- I'm fearful of it, um, and I worry about, as I say, my competence; although, I have great evidence that I am competent in that, and stuff. So -- 

00:49:55
DR. REID WILSON So -- 

00:49:55
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:49:55
DR. REID WILSON Fine. Good. So we have that. So when that signal pops up, got any thoughts about how you might want to respond to that, at this moment? 

00:50:05
BARBARA  My -- again, my inclination is to say, 'Well, just start doing it, just, you know -- 

00:50:15
DR. REID WILSON Okay. 

00:50:15
BARBARA -- get going and -- 

00:50:15
DR. REID WILSON Are you saying 'My inclination is to say to myself "Start doing it"'? 

00:50:20
BARBARA Actually take some action. 

00:50:20
DR. REID WILSON Okay. Is that different than what you've been doing? 

00:50:25
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:50:25
DR. REID WILSON What -- what have you been doing instead? 

00:50:25
BARBARA Procrastinating. 

00:50:30
DR. REID WILSON Really? I'm so surprised to hear that. Okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Well, at least you're consistent. 

00:50:35
BARBARA Yes. 

00:50:35
DR. REID WILSON Yeah? 

00:50:35
BARBARA Yes. 

00:50:35
DR. REID WILSON So -- okay. So maybe we don't have to do much about that. So let me say one more thing, and then I actually may surprise you, but I'm gonna open up to the audience for questions. So if -- if there is anybody in the audience who wants to ask you or I anything, if they go ahead and step up to the microphone so we don't waste time. 

00:50:55
BARBARA That's fine. 

00:50:55
DR. REID WILSON So -- but the -- the last piece I would say is -- and the other component working with worry, is to - and you'll find this as good news - structure in pleasurable activities. Gee, what do you think you would do for a pleasurable activity? Would you do piano, or piano? Or hang out with friends, or play the piano, or hang out with friends? 

00:51:30
BARBARA I -- I'm not really sure again. I -- I -- there are times when I really would love to play the piano. Um -- 

00:51:35
DR. REID WILSON So -- but the issue is, as you're in the process of working on managing your worry -- 

00:51:40
BARBARA Yeah, make -- 

00:51:40
DR. REID WILSON -- you need to be -- 

00:51:40
BARBARA Make -- 

00:51:40
DR. REID WILSON -- in the process of creating -- 

00:51:45
BARBARA Make -- 

00:51:45
DR. REID WILSON -- pleasurable activities. 

00:51:45
BARBARA Yes. 

00:51:45
DR. REID WILSON You don't wanna be going, you know, 'Got to make my first million before I started having fun.' You gotta do -- 

00:51:50
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:51:50
DR. REID WILSON -- be the process of making your million and be in the process of -- 

00:51:50
BARBARA That would be -- 

00:51:50
DR. REID WILSON -- enjoying yourself. 

00:51:55
BARBARA -- something I would enjoy doing. I -- I would definitely enjoy doing that, yeah. 

00:51:55
DR. REID WILSON And I'm just giving you some of the data that we know about -- about worry, and then we'll stop, which is, people who worry get so caught up in 'This is my problem. How do I fix it?', and so forth, that they don't carve out that other time. 

00:52:05
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:52:05
DR. REID WILSON And you just gotta carve it out as part of the intervention. 

00:52:10
BARBARA Um-hum. 

00:52:10
DR. REID WILSON That make sense to you? 

00:52:15
BARBARA Yes. 

00:52:15
DR. REID WILSON Okay. So -- 

00:52:15
BARBARA Yes. 

00:52:15
DR. REID WILSON -- tell me a little bit how -- how this went for you this time. 

00:52:20
BARBARA Oh, this was very interesting and -- and very -- I found it very enjoyable actually. I -- I don't really spend a lot of time looking at myself and -- in this way. Um -- oh, I'm sorry. I -- I think, uh -- I think that I've learned a great deal, and, um, I think that as time goes by and I process more, I will even get more out of it. I -- um, I didn't expect to get that much. I didn't think I had that many worries. I -- I really didn't. I said, 'Oh, I'm gonna be a big flop today. I'm not gonna have enough to talk about.' But, um -- 

00:52:55
DR. REID WILSON So that is so funny, coz that's what I thought was gonna happen to me. 

00:52:55
BARBARA Oh, yeah? 

00:52:55
DR. REID WILSON So, um, takes one to treat one, right? 

00:53:00
BARBARA Oh, okay. 

00:53:00
DR. REID WILSON So, um -- 

00:53:00
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:53:00
DR. REID WILSON So two weeks from now -- 

00:53:05
BARBARA Yes. 

00:53:05
DR. REID WILSON -- how does it sound, two weeks from now, you and I getting on the phone and checking in? We'll schedule a particular time, we'll e-mail each other and do that. And what would you wanna be reporting in to me about in two weeks? What would you -- 

00:53:15
BARBARA I have to tell you right away, though, I won't be able to play the piano, coz my piano's in New York and I am in Florida. 

00:53:20
DR. REID WILSON Oh, okay. 

00:53:20
BARBARA So -- 

00:53:20
DR. REID WILSON Okay. 

00:53:20
BARBARA So unless I go out and buy a piano -- 

00:53:20
DR. REID WILSON Well, what you would do is you go to the store and say 'I'm shopping for a piano.' 

00:53:25
BARBARA Oh, and I play there? Yeah, find -- 

00:53:30
DR. REID WILSON Okay, so what -- 

00:53:30
BARBARA -- somebody's that's got -- yeah. 

00:53:30
DR. REID WILSON So what would you like to be talking about in two weeks when we talk? And then we'll do two weeks after that. 

00:53:35
BARBARA Um, I think I would like to review some of the things that we talked about: the signal versus the noise and -- 

00:53:40
DR. REID WILSON What actions -- 

00:53:40
BARBARA -- that in-between thing -- 

00:53:40
DR. REID WILSON -- do you think you -- 

00:53:45
BARBARA -- that I -- 

00:53:45
DR. REID WILSON -- will be doing between now and then? 

00:53:45
BARBARA What actions? Um, with reg -- I -- I'm hoping that, um, more and more I will see that if I -- if I distinguish between the two kinds of worry, that, um -- that I will have less of a problem -- 

00:54:05
DR. REID WILSON Okay. 

00:54:05
BARBARA -- with all this, yes. 

00:54:05
DR. REID WILSON And so you might want to keep some notes about that so that when we talk you'll -- you'll -- 

00:54:05
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:54:05
DR. REID WILSON -- know. 

00:54:05
BARBARA  Yeah. 

00:54:10
DR. REID WILSON Okay. So we're gonna stop now and just turn to them and see there's anybody who has any -- but if not, then we'll just -- 

00:54:15
BARBARA Then we can go? 

00:54:15
DR. REID WILSON -- talk among ourselves. So -- 

00:54:15
BARBARA Okay. 

00:54:15
DR. REID WILSON Um -- 

00:54:20
BARBARA All right. 

00:54:25
[sil.] 

00:54:25
DR. REID WILSON So we'll take one question and then we'll end formally. And if you have other things you wanna ask us, you can just come up front. So this'll be the one question. So this is a very critical question because everything is riding on -- 

00:54:40
UNKNOWN Well, I've already -- I've already messed up coz I have two real quick -- 

00:54:40
DR. REID WILSON Okay. 

00:54:40
UNKNOWN Okay. For the -- for the client -- I don't know your name, um -- 

00:54:45
BARBARA  Barbara. 

00:54:50
UNKNOWN Barbara. I found this quite challenging because I found that you didn't -- you had no awareness that you even had worry. And I was curious about what that was like for both of you. The second question is, I'm -- I was struck by your use of the word "why" so often, because I try to avoid that in my practice. And I -- I'd like to hear more how that works for you. 

00:55:15
DR. REID WILSON Okay. I would let Barbara answer both those questions. Don't ask me why. I just -- 

00:55:20
BARBARA Well, I -- I really don't know why I -- I'm not aware -- or have not been really that aware of my worrying. I -- I -- I have a hunch it has to do with denial and it has to do with a lot of tension around everything in my life, so that, um, it just has kind of escaped me. And as I say, I know people have said this to me, and I don't just believe them, but I haven't been able to internalize what they've said to me. So this was helpful -- very helpful to concretize it for me. As far as the why, "why" is a very confrontational question, but in this case, I felt that you're asking why, and I am gonna answer that. You know, it was -- was helpful again to me because it forced me to really, you know, look at it. I -- I just have not been looking at that, uh, side of me. 

00:56:10
DR. REID WILSON Yeah, and it's planting a seed for her that there's an explanation that she's not aware of: You know, why is this -- you know, it's -- and I'm doing it relatively innocently. 

00:56:15
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:56:15
DR. REID WILSON But it -- it begins to say, 'This is what's important. What you think this is about may not necessarily be what this is about.' Thank you for coming. 

00:56:30
BARBARA Thank you.
