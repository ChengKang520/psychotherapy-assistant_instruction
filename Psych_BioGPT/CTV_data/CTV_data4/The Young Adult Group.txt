Chapter Five: The Second Session Focusing on Mindfulness of Body Sensations 

00:01:00
Mindfulness-Based CBT Group 

00:01:05
UNKNOWN Hi, I'm Dr. Annie (inaudible )Argosy university of Atlanta. And I'm here today with Dr. Allison Spargo, and Dr. Shane Blasko also from Argosy university of Atlanta, to discuss the facilitation of a mindfulness-based CBT Group with adolescent clients. Allison and Shane welcome. 

00:01:20
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:01:20
UNKNOWN So talk so little bit about what to expect on today's video? 

00:01:20
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah, so today we're going to umm… include a demonstration on how they facilitate Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Group with adolescents. And you notice that adolescents are little bit on odder side of adolescents. So there was the some other things that will be demonstrating and facilitating in our videos today. 

00:01:40
UNKNOWN Okay, so generally speaking this is apical to a very wide range of clients and (inaudible ) it's sounds like. 

00:01:47
ALLISON SPARGO I think there's there is strength in individuals who have an awareness or an interest in that introspection, umm… individuals who might not have the insight or the awareness might not, might struggle little bit more with the content of what we're doing with the psycho-educational piece. And however there is still an opportunity for them to maybe buy into the material and for them to so grow as a result of being a group, a group member. 

00:02:10
UNKNOWN Sure OK Great I'm hearing a lot about very here and then now present focus, self acceptance, non-judgmental. So that seems maybe very different than the way adolescents are typically socialized to think it's a developmental stage when you're often highly self-critical, you know, fitting in with peers is very important. So I imagine that's a big shift for a lot of clients who may be in this sort of group. Umm… so why don't you said is that from what we're about to see who's in the group, what is the group membership like? 

00:02:35
ALLISON SPARGO That's a great question so uh… Shane and I were very intentional in the way that we that we choose that we chose this particular group. Umm… So we were looking for a diverse group and like I said we wanted group for the most part we found individuals who fell within that adolescent category without falling into the minor limit. Umm… So you'll be seeing umm… a really diverse group of men and women and different socioeconomic statuses, different ethnicities, different religious backgrounds, different experience levels of engaging and group engaging in the counseling process, and so those are some of the things that you might be able to identify from the exteriors of our group members, and then as you watch the video you're probably going to be come aware of the different interior, the different interpersonal styles that our group members um, experiences as, as they're participate in these next few sessions. 

00:03:30
UNKNOWN Okay. Great so there's, there's visible our cultural identities that we notice by the way and also the, you know, cultural identities that may not be visible immediately but can be just as impactful on the group process. 

00:03:40
ALLISON SPARGO Yes, definitely. 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN Okay, great. Umm… so anything that you want to add before we take a look? 

00:03:45
ALLISON SPARGO I think the only thing to, to address is maybe that umm… for the sake of time these, these sessions have been a little bit truncated. So what you're going to see on these videos will represent some of that the kind of the best in the worst of these group counseling sessions, and so umm… you might not see all of our activities, and you might not see all of the questions that we have asked but as a result of that you'll be able to see kind of what are the meaning making moments for the members… 

00:04:10
SHANE BLASKO Right, so practicing a technique was very important for our group members but doesn't matter which technique is practiced. So we're not saying that the practice of the technique wasn't very important for the process, for these group members. What we're saying is for the sake of time we chose to cut out some of the time of the technique so that our viewers were able to get more of the process… 

00:04:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:04:40
SHANE BLASKO …rather than sitting and watching and listening to the actual technique itself. 

00:04:45
ALLISON SPARGO And this is a psycho-educational groups, so, so long as you are familiar with the material of what a mindfulness CBT group is you can… you can disseminate that information however it is it seems relevant for you as a facilitator. And so we share briefly about that on these videos but also encourage our viewers to take that for themselves, to find their own definition that makes that's important for them so that they're comfortable with the content and their delivery system. And so again that's, that's the reason that we've cut in some places and then left the process and the outcomes for others. 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN Okay so the basic structure then of running this type of group would be introducing the concept of my mindfulness in a psycho educational way introducing some activities that demonstrate the concept of mindfulness and then really working through a processing each of those activities in a way that allows the participants to sort of come to their own understanding make meaning of mindfulness. 

00:05:35
ALLISON SPARGO Yes, definitely. 

00:05:35
UNKNOWN Okay, great. Let's take a look. 

00:05:40
ALLISON SPARGO I'd like to take some time to introduce myself, my co-leader Dr. Blasko to review some of the material that we might be talking through and also get to know you guys as well. We're going to be spending four sessions together around mindfulness CBT and so I'd like to just spend some time today setting the groundwork and the framework so that we can really dive in deeper and explore selves more fully over the next sessions as well. I'm hearing a couple of things already that you're open I heard that several times whether it's aware that you said or if it's just an idea that you kind of embodied somewhere in that group and that's awesome. And then also that you're interested so that's also outstanding for this group today. Umm… Has anybody ever heard the word mindfulness before? No, no, no one. But the real goal of mindfulness for us today is to try to get into the present moment and then try to get into the next present moment. And then try to get into the next one present moment here's the catch without judging ourselves when we get distracted. And without judging ourself when we feel something that we don't want to be feeling we should honor our selves, right. Well when we think something that's not helpful or that we are critical about inside of ourselves. And so moment by moment without judgment, see some eyebrows, we see your eyebrows… 

00:07:05
UNKNOWN That's difficult. 

00:07:05
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah, it is difficult. Do you guys do this (inaudible ) so now described mindfullness, right. Is this something that you do? 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN No. 

00:07:20
ALLISON SPARGO Instead what like describe to us what do you do on regular day, on regular basis? 

00:07:25
UNKNOWN I usually focus on the future. 

00:07:25
ALLISON SPARGO The future. Okay. 

00:07:25
UNKNOWN Trying to get to my goals. 

00:07:30
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. And that's going to have balls. 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN I'm usually thinking about what's going to be my next meal, that's always when my mind is full. 

00:07:40
Establishing group structure 

00:07:40
ALLISON SPARGO And that's, that's really fine so I know we're giggling but if that's where your mind is then that's where your mind is and there's no judgment around that, that's just what is important to you at that moment is, what's next, what's my next meal? 

00:07:55
SHANE BLASKO Anybody ever find yourself doing things on autopilot? 

00:08:00
ALLISON SPARGO You have a zone now. 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN All the time. 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN All the time, yeah. 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN If (inaudible ). 

00:08:10
Summary of goals for 4 group sessions 

00:08:10
Setting group expectations 

00:08:10
Allowing group to establish own rules 

00:08:10
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah, you find yourself I'm, I'm flipping my phone, right. So I'm flipping my phone and I look up and I've lost however many minutes hours, days. So mindfulness is the opposite of all of that, mindfulness is the opposite of zoning out of losing track of time. Mindfulness is living fully in each moment as they come. And already I'm hearing that this is a different experience than what you have it naturally right now. So we're going to be asking to learn a little bit about all the different aspects of mindfulness, we're going to asking you to practice some activities related to this different aspects of mindfulness. And then we're also going to be asking in our groups to process what it is that you're taking from the both the learning and the practice. Okay, so there is a kind of structure of our group activity of our groups. Umm… We have four different sessions and it's broken up I think I mentioned bodily sensations first, our next session covers our umm… mindfulness of thoughts, the third session our mindfulness of emotions and the fourth session is a wrap up and also called the wandering minds to seeing and naturally letting ourselves explore. Okay, all right so I just talked a lot and I'm going to put it back on you because in a group we have a group energy, all right. And energy can be impacted by one person it can be impacted by the entire entity. But sometimes group we find that it is more convenient to think about some of the guidelines or some of the roles before we get started rather than somebody feeling hurt, or somebody feeling excluded or inter talent in a way, and then we have to scramble to create rules about safety. So I'd like to spend a couple minutes just talking about some rules, guidelines that would encourage a sense of safety and atmosphere safety in our group. Did anything that kind of comes to mind? 

00:10:10
UNKNOWN I feel respect to make sure some one say something that you may not agree with the just respect then, you know, respect that they say… 

00:10:20
Creating safety in the group 

00:10:20
UNKNOWN What about being I can bear it that's what came to mind for me, umm… think something that I don't necessarily I guess think it's embarrassing but my reaction would make me feel embarrassed. 

00:10:40
ALLISON SPARGO I see. So maybe sensitive to the experiences of other people… 

00:10:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:10:45
ALLISON SPARGO …would that be something that'll be helpful, okay. 

00:10:50
UNKNOWN I guess like you finish, you know, even if you do agree and it's a positive reaction to this I guess later I want to finish with (inaudible) and you know, let me just get it out. 

00:11:05
ALLISON SPARGO Definitely great. Okay. About no comparing, 

00:11:10
[sil.] 

00:11:15
ALLISON SPARGO (inaudible ) that begun, yeah, and that could be something that you do internally, and your thoughts, your emotions or it could be something that you do externally (inaudible ) you know, you do internally sometimes. 

00:11:26
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) met you. 

00:11:30
Linking rules and goals 

00:11:30
Transition from early group to mid group 

00:11:30
ALLISON SPARGO And again this group is about not only creating the insight about what we do and why we do it maybe but also not judging ourselves. So if we do it a lot and it seems like it's a lot and we would prefer to do it less but we're not going to be critical of ourselves, just like we wouldn't be critical of our group members. 

00:11:50
[sil.] 

00:11:55
ALLISON SPARGO Okay, so talked about some zoning out I've talked about kind of what mindfulness can be, talked about some group roles and goals. Is there anything else before we move into actually doing a little bit of mindfulness? 

00:12:15
UNKNOWN I don't think so. 

00:12:20
Introduction of group exercise 

00:12:20
ALLISON SPARGO Okay, okay. All right so, our first session starts with mindfulness of bodily sensations. Umm… There are a lot of different ways that you can experience here bodily sensations there are things called mind guided body scans, umm… breathing is something that is really important, and mindfulness. I know Dr. Blasko, she and I talked (inaudible ) about how breathing, your breath can be your anchor. So as we do each of these things we're going to always come back to remember that our breath is our anchor, right. So you wouldn't be here if you weren't breathing, right. Are you aware as you breathing? Away where you a minute again (inaudible ), right. Because I do your attention to it, you actually paid attention to it. So breathless are anchored, I say that a lot because it is and I want you to remember that so if you get in a place where you are distracted gently remind yourself that your breath is anchor. And that if you're focusing on your breathing there's really not a lot of room for other things in there. Okay, so we're going to spend this first session doing some bodily sensations with their breath as a anchor, and Dr. Blasko is going to lead us in an activity around their bodily sensations. 

00:13:40
Setting up structure of group exercises 

00:13:40
Group exercise: Mindfulness of Breath 

00:13:40
SHANE BLASKO With each of the activities that we do in these sessions, we're going to begin and end each of their activities with the bells will ring the bells twice to let you know that we've begun and to help bring your focus into the present moment and then law and each of them with the bells to remind yourself to let you know gently that we're coming out of the activity as well, okay. And umm… so begin with out going the bells, okay. 

00:14:10
[music] 

00:14:15
SHANE BLASKO So feel sick with your feet both place on the ground, sitting upright in a dignified posture, and as you get yourself comfortable, you can close your eyes if you choose if you're comfortable. Just start to notice your breath. You don't need to alter it, just notice it. 

00:14:45
[sil.] 

00:14:50
SHANE BLASKO Start to notice where in your body you feel it. 

00:14:55
[sil.] 

00:15:00
SHANE BLASKO Notice if you feel it in your nostrils, breathing in and out your nostrils. Gently across your upper lip. 

00:15:20
[sil.] 

00:15:25
SHANE BLASKO Notice if you feel your breath in your chest. 

00:15:30
[sil.] 

00:15:40
SHANE BLASKO It might help if you like to place your right hand on your chest. See if you feel your chest rising and falling with your breath. You may also want to notice if you feel your breath in your abdomen see you might choose to place your left hand on your belly. See if you can feel your belly moving in and out with each breath. 

00:16:20
[sil.] 

00:16:25
SHANE BLASKO Just continuing to be aware of your breath. 

00:16:30
[sil.] 

00:16:35
SHANE BLASKO And as you pay attention to your breath, you probably are noticing thoughts or entering your mind this is perfectly normal. You can just focus back on your breath, each time thoughts distract you just go back to the breath. 

00:17:00
[sil.] 

00:17:05
SHANE BLASKO Noticing, what you're feeling and where you're feeling it. 

00:17:15
[sil.] 

00:17:40
[music] 

00:17:50
Transition from group exercise to group process 

00:17:55
[sil.] 

00:18:15
SHANE BLASKO So how was that first short exercise for you guys? 

00:18:20
UNKNOWN It was kind of hard when you say you may notice thoughts coming into your mind, I kind of chocked little bit because that's exactly what was happening. So it's a little challenging I guess. 

00:18:40
SHANE BLASKO Challenging because you are having so many thoughts popping in head. 

00:18:45
UNKNOWN Right, yeah. Yeah. 

00:18:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, with the family when you first said you feel (inaudible ) would think like my foot in my chest, you know that's (inaudible ). So you got to the chest and felt okay I'm still no more because (inaudible ). 

00:19:05
UNKNOWN At first there was relaxing and then some kind of way it's turned into a task for me. So I was like Oh, okay and I feel it there, I felt here, oh, okay now I feel it there, it was like I was trying to go with where you were going with it to see if that's where I felt it. And I'm like why am I doing this, I can barely what I feel like okay, and I'm like okay both case, okay, they (inaudible ) it was this whole thing that became a little much for me. 

00:19:35
Group members connecting with each other around the internal challenge of the exercise 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN I think I was less focused on my breath and more focused on the fact that I could feel my pulse overriding my breath so I was catching myself like holding my breath more than anything else because I would just felt my pulse the whole time some. 

00:19:55
UNKNOWN Actually felt it relaxing, I felt your voice of soothing so I was just listening to your voice. 

00:20:05
UNKNOWN And I guess (inaudible ) like hear me umm… I was fine and see it's like oh we stop the (inaudible ) but I'm thinking about later, I'm like oh, well stop, okay, well what, okay, okay. And I think that was for me more trauma stop those thoughts to make sure that I umm… was focusing on my breathing. So for me it was kind of like a task or I'm like okay, we will stop thinking, why are you thinking, why are you talking kind of (inaudible ) so, so. 

00:20:35
UNKNOWN And see that with a similar reaction in Jerry when I was doing it. I instead of laughing when he said that you probably thinking some thoughts. I for myself smile because during exercise like I was more focused instead of my breathing on my heart and just beady and like that's were my attention (inaudible ) like you probably thinking that your thought was like yeah, and so my heart right now sort of my breathing and I just thought it was interesting that I was unable to necessarily focus as much of my breathing as I was like my heart beating. 

00:21:15
Group leader linking and normalizing the shared experiences 

00:21:15
SHANE BLASKO It sounds like it was a pretty talented exercise for all of you guys. It's very, it's this fits our minds wander I mean that's what they do I mean our whole last exercise again is no undermine. The thoughts our minds go there our minds don't want to stay focused on one thing so it's that natural tendency and that's, that's normal, that's, that's not any of us doing anything wrong. They just keep to keep going somewhere else and so that's why so many of us have that experience and then it's very easy to try and follow what I'm saying to do and go away that's not, that's not focusing on my breath that's following something else or, or I'm, I'm here, I'm there umm… that the non, the non-judgment piece there. My thoughts are wandering going to going somewhere else, and it's okay, and I'm going back to my breath. It's, it's the key of the non-judgment instead of my thoughts of what it sounds like you got to the non-judgment piece the smile, my thoughts are somewhere else, smile which is great as opposed to my thoughts or somewhere else and doing something wrong to get out of that mindset of what I'm doing something wrong, I get into the mindset of okay, my thoughts are somewhere else. And I try and focus back on my breath and sort of building a muscle because it's not about trying to be there already, it's not about any kind of perfection it's just about building a process. 

00:22:50
ALLISON SPARGO And something about mindfulness is contrary to probably what we experience. So we work towards a goal, we work towards seeking the test, we work towards getting the job or get buy a car or moving out of our parents' house, whatever it is and we're working towards we have a goal in mind. And mindfulness the goal is to be on the journey, right because there is no end, you will never be totally 100% mindful, right now. 

00:23:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:23:15
ALLISON SPARGO What do we do if there's no goal in mind like if there's not an end result how will you know that you're done? And that can be very… 

00:23:20
UNKNOWN Daunting. 

00:23:20
ALLISON SPARGO …daunting. 

00:23:25
UNKNOWN So you just keep wondering? 

00:23:30
Creating group buy in around mindfulness-based CBT 

00:23:30
ALLISON SPARGO That's terrifying, that's terrifying. And so this is actually a really normal experience, a group come in and on the first day they're like looking at me like that, they're looking at me like I'm that four eyes or two heads or whatever it happens to be because why would anybody want to do this, right. Yeah, why would anybody want to do something that is a lifetime journey with no end goal, right? Why would anybody want to do something that makes me laugh at myself inside because I'm not doing it right or makes me laugh at myself or provides me the space to expose that self-critical thought or emotion, right? Why would we want to do that? You're look at me like, tell me why… Okay, so let me tell you some other reason that you might want to do that is because when we experience each moment as a moment sometimes we experience over with practice of not judging ourselves or not being self-critical or not reprehending ourselves inside that is actually quite liberating to say I have a choice. I can go to the future or I can explore, explore my breath. I can look at the pass, or I could just be here in the moment. I can experience this emotion fully and honestly whether it's a pleasant one or an unpleasant one, whether it's sadness or joy, and feel okay and comfortable with it right now. Team with the thoughts of the present ones, the ones that drive us mad, right now I'm thinking whatever right and to be okay with it. And that down the road is very liberating for a lot of people because you're not, you intrude yourself you get to decide we're going to be present in this moment and not judge myself. Or am I going to go down the road and not judge myself. So even it's mentioned earlier that there was a lot of a lot of reason that you are kind of critical for yourself right, whether it's thoughts or emotions are external or internal, could you imagine a life without that? I'm seeing lot of faces (inaudible ). 

00:25:45
UNKNOWN No. 

00:25:45
UNKNOWN No. 

00:25:45
ALLISON SPARGO No. If it was out there would it be okay? 

00:25:50
UNKNOWN Yes, yeah. 

00:25:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:25:55
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah, I think so. So that's why we do mindfulness because we work towards exploring that process of not judging ourselves automatically we have a lot of automatic thoughts a lot of automatic experiences and so we can always make the choice to let those automatic experiences go or not. And mindfulness will help you feel like you have that choice and provides you practice and process with how to make that conscious decision in those moments. So you onboard but (inaudible ) here's he like, I don't know. 

00:26:32
UNKNOWN Little scared. 

00:26:35
ALLISON SPARGO Little scared. Talk just about why you're little scared? 

00:26:35
UNKNOWN I'm because like when you say, you know, those thoughts are always there and think I'm so they are and like my thinking in the future is like prep work… 

00:26:50
ALLISON SPARGO I know, I know. 

00:26:50
UNKNOWN …I'm thinking about what's the next move and I'm… I guess if I'm not thinking that then everything is going to crash around me. 

00:27:00
ALLISON SPARGO Okay. 

00:27:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN Why did… 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN Scared me. 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, I', with you Jeremy 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:27:10
Group members connecting with each other 

00:27:10
UNKNOWN Because I'm the fabric of drive off of always living in the future sometimes like whatever's the next move that that like motivates me because I know I have something to work for like if I'm not thinking about what's coming next then I feel like I'm this flown in space like I'm just… that's scary. 

00:27:25
Drawing out/linking 

00:27:25
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. Is anybody else share the same apprehension, scared, feared. 

00:27:30
UNKNOWN I do I think that if you, you know, stick to the plan and focus on the future then it's somehow easier because you focus all your attention on that and it's like meeting a goal whereas if you're focused on the present then, you know, if the goals might change or the future might change and that sometimes scary to think about the present that makes changes… 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN Change is bad. 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN Changes really bad. 

00:28:00
ALLISON SPARGO Okay, okay. Change is hard, change is really hard. I heard just saying one of there was umm… judgmental type things… 

00:28:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:28:10
ALLISON SPARGO …change is bad. And so it can be unpleasant, is it bad maybe… 

00:28:15
UNKNOWN A little. 

00:28:15
ALLISON SPARGO Okay. And that's fine if it's bad then that's bad and I would never take away from any of you what your experiences are because those are your experiences. 

00:28:25
UNKNOWN Mine isn't so much like apprehension about thinking about the future is just being okay with whatever I'm thinking in the moment. To me that freaks me out. I feel more comfortable either thinking about the future or thinking about what happened to me being in the moment I mean present is terrifying because all the times like the present isn't always so great. 

00:28:55
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

00:28:55
UNKNOWN And I can use thinking about the future, you know, or something good is going to happen as kind of an escape… 

00:29:00
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

00:29:00
UNKNOWN …because it's more pleasant… 

00:29:00
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

00:29:05
UNKNOWN …so for me that part freaks me out in a slow terrifying because the present is always good. 

00:29:10
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

00:29:10
SHANE BLASKO So it's, it's safety to avoid the present. 

00:29:15
UNKNOWN Sometimes yeah.. 

00:29:15
ALLISON SPARGO And I saw a lot of head nod when you're saying that sounds like… 

00:29:20
UNKNOWN I agree. 

00:29:20
UNKNOWN I agree. 

00:29:25
ALLISON SPARGO So other people do that too. Yeah. So it definitely feel safer if we're not in the present. So we feel vulnerable in the present. 

00:29:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:29:30
ALLISON SPARGO Is at the outset of safety in the future? Okay, right. 

00:29:40
Linking 

00:29:40
UNKNOWN Or it stagnate maybe, you feel stagnate… 

00:29:40
UNKNOWN That's the word. 

00:29:40
UNKNOWN … like you're not, you're not doing something what you're supposed to be doing something but you're not because you're in the present and the future maybe isn't going to happen because you're not going right now in the… 

00:29:55
ALLISON SPARGO Mindfulness doesn't mean that you're giving up your goals. It doesn't mean that you're losing your motivation or that not that's you going to become stagnant because each moment is replaced by the next moment. So we are always moving towards the future one moment, and one moment and one moment. And we can still look to the future there's no problem with looking to the future. But again you have the choice of right now be in this moment I look to the future. Right now be in this moment, right now I'll be in this moment. Oh it's like I went to the future, right. So it's not giving up any of those things. I think it might shift that we use it as a way to escape a little bit. Most are going to do that too because that's what we do sometimes. I'm seeing little bit more smiles you look nervous when we started. I know it seems so smiles so do we have a group on board with proceeding with mindfulness? 

00:31:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:31:05
Transition from working to termination of this session 

00:31:05
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. Okay. The following sessions are about thoughts, the third session is about emotions and the fourth is wondering mind. So I know we've identified a couple of thoughts where we're going to pick up there with the mindfulness of thoughts. What kind of thoughts do you carry with you regularly? 

00:31:20
UNKNOWN Alive. 

00:31:25
ALLISON SPARGO Alive. Am I doing this where I umm… that's am I doing this, am I doing this right. 

00:31:35
UNKNOWN I think my answer would be what am I doing… 

00:31:40
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

00:31:40
UNKNOWN …like I'm or am I supposed to be doing something else or just what's the point (inaudible ). 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:31:50
ALLISON SPARGO So a couple different ones but they're all… 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:31:55
ALLISON SPARGO …okay. 

00:31:55
UNKNOWN I catch myself thinking Gosh, I wish this would go faster. Oceans would have been a little quicker I'm ready I'm ready for whatever that next step is. I'm so always killing time always too early to where I need to be because I'm like, you know, it's hard to get it done. 

00:32:15
ALLISON SPARGO So is it this is one of the thoughts where you up let's get it done that's one of the most… 

00:32:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:32:20
UNKNOWN Most things but what I had to do like all literally all day long that is my mind like okay since how we (inaudible ) have to go to do this, to do this we have to do that and so like it's the first place is like okay naïve I have to do this and so you finish that you look for this like that and tomorrow you have to do this, and next you have to do that. It's where my mind always up. 

00:32:50
UNKNOWN I've been (inaudible ) just taking the coal am I doing the right, all the time. Okay I just did that was their right now maybe it wasn't. 

00:33:00
ALLISON SPARGO So even when you think these thoughts I would imagine that an emotion comes up maybe it because of anxiety or sense of stress something like that, right. So we're going to look at them one by one but then we're going to tie them up together. So it's a homework assignment but I want you to consider what are some other thoughts that are helpful for you and what are the some other ones that might be umm… someone blocks for you between now and next time so that we can prepare for the session next time. And also the breathing so right now you don't have to close your eyes or dignified posture but you may just think about your breathing for a second. Remember that you can choose to breathe when your breath is your anger. 

00:33:45
SHANE BLASKO And you can do that at any time of the day doing any activity. Is, is something that you can pay attention to when you are in the car or in the bus, when you are in a class or when you are outside in a park umm… when you're washing dishes or when you're cleaning up this is, you know, any, any activity that you could be doing you can be paying attention to your breathing. Even, even if you're, you know, playing sports you could be paying attention to how your breathing is different when you're playing sports than when you're not. You can still be paying attention to your breathing. So you can always attend to it and it can always bring you back into your present moment. 

00:34:35
ALLISON SPARGO I think to trying too we are not trying to alter your breathing, we're not trying to encourage you to take a deep breath and you, you might notice that you are doing that but it's more of just a curiousness of what I'm experiencing and not judging if you're taking a deep breaths not saying, I shouldn't be breathing like that or the shallow breaths, you know, anything like that to keep away from that critical self. Again going back to if we're not going to be critical of each other and we should have the self-respect to do that for ourselves but that sounds like something that we're going to struggle with and maybe process through a little bit more right, okay. All right, so awareness of some thoughts for next time right ones that are helpful on harmful and also bodily sensations. So I know we focused on breathing but are there any other bodily sensations body sensations that umm… you're aware of, so if you had to say right now I'm sitting in this seat and I am feeling in my body. 

00:35:40
UNKNOWN A headache. 

00:35:40
ALLISON SPARGO A headache, okay. So you're feeling pain in your head. Yeah, okay. 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN For me it's still my heartbeat. 

00:35:50
ALLISON SPARGO Still your heart beat. 

00:35:55
UNKNOWN I guess I'm more aware now of my breathing… 

00:36:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:36:00
ALLISON SPARGO Supply product, yeah. Yeah. 

00:36:10
UNKNOWN Moving my foot. 

00:36:10
ALLISON SPARGO You're moving your foot. 

00:36:10
UNKNOWN No particular reason. 

00:36:15
UNKNOWN It's stilled my chest. Yeah, I feel really (inaudible ). 

00:36:25
ALLISON SPARGO I can feel my shoulders. I feel my shoulders. 

00:36:35
SHANE BLASKO I'm very aware of how my arms feel as are touching and where they're touching the chair. 

00:36:45
ALLISON SPARGO And again this is counter to what we normally do. And you'll pay attention to your dealing hopefully. And if you don't stop to think about it you might not notice you have a headache until you stop to think about it, right. 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN Breathing is what made realize like (inaudible ). 

00:37:00
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. So we're just going to spend some time getting to know ourselves. And that's what mindfulness is not letting go of our goals again so I don't want you to feel nervous about I'm asking you to do something that's going to totally alter the path of your life although my it might because you might transform, or you might not, and be okay with yourself, face cut yeah. 

00:37:20
[sil.] 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:37:30
ALLISON SPARGO Okay. Yeah, well let's call this group at an end and we'll pick up next time we're going to start each group with the, with the breathing activity just assign them to remind them to practice. So if you don't mind consider practicing it between now and then if you don't, don't criticize yourself, if you do or you experience a heart beat and you're more attuned to that rather than to your breath that's just where it is. And so let's practice those things if you get tomb and then we'll, we can be here for a next session, okay. Okay. Thank you guys. 

00:38:05
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:38:05
ALLISON SPARGO Thank you.

00:38:10
The Second Session Focusing on Mindfulness of Thoughts 

00:38:10
Summary of previous session 

00:38:15
ALLISON SPARGO Hi guys, welcome back. 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN Hi. 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN Hi. 

00:38:15
ALLISON SPARGO So last session we visited our body sensations we went over a little bit of mindfulness we got some group roles for our group to come up to stay safe and we really focused on but those are anchored and being gentle with ourselves not that self judgmental piece that sometimes we get tangled in brain and you know I give you a couple homework assignments last time and one was to practice your breathing… 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN Like there's always some kind of thought whether is to what am I suppose to be doing next or those last sound I heard on the radio, there's always something there. 

00:38:50
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

00:38:55
UNKNOWN And I'm still working on it. 

00:38:55
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

00:38:55
UNKNOWN I'm still working on it. 

00:38:55
UNKNOWN Every the light (inaudible ) deeper, like when I call attention to my breathing now I take like a lot of deep breath and then I'm like why are you taking such deep breaths just breathe and then it's like this whole thing, and so like you know breathing shouldn't be this hard so that I just don't want to do it. See… 

00:39:15
ALLISON SPARGO And then sometime you might stop breathing. 

00:39:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:39:15
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

00:39:15
UNKNOWN I thought all together. Just for a little seconds, I'm like oh okay. It's a whole thing this breath. 

00:39:30
Group members connecting around challenge of mindfulness of Breath 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN I found myself focusing on my breathing a lot more often like constantly doing it taking a lot deep breaths, yeah, but the thoughts are still there. 

00:39:35
ALLISON SPARGO Thoughts are still there, yeah. 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN And I tried it once since we live and I didn't really my mind was everywhere so instead of me feeling like I can't do it right I just haven't done it again. 

00:39:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:39:50
ALLISON SPARGO Come on you guys, did you practice? 

00:39:55
UNKNOWN I didn't. 

00:39:55
ALLISON SPARGO No. 

00:40:00
UNKNOWN I think I was because I go first time just focusing on the heartbeat and stuff I was scared to try for myself 'cause I was like what if it happen again, and why is it happening instead of just letting it happen and not questioning them. 

00:40:10
ALLISON SPARGO And it you said a similar experience, you know, you experience you (inaudible ) better than your breath, right? 

00:40:16
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:40:16
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

00:40:16
UNKNOWN I think it because I tend to hold my breath a lot and so it's easier for me to focus on my heartbeat versus on my actual breath. 

00:40:25
SHANE BLASKO So today we're of course we're going to add a couple things just also think about umm… how do you guys are have a tendency towards perfectionism? 

00:40:40
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

00:40:45
Normalizing the desire to do the activity perfectly 

00:40:45
Group Leader self discloses experiences for group members 

00:40:45
Revisiting the goals of Mindfulness CBT 

00:40:45
SHANE BLASKO Okay. If we keep going backed you mindfulness has as a call it a role if you work is only role is to try and try and stay focused on the present without judging yourself. So I'm staying present in the moment and not judging myself if my thoughts move to something else and I'm not judging myself that's what I'm doing in the present moment. And I'm not judging myself. I'm not doing it wrong, I'm not judging myself. If I'm trying it, I'm trying it and I'm not judging myself. I'm doing it and I'm focusing on my heart and I'm not judging myself, and I'm doing it. I practice one time and I'm not judging myself. I practiced one time I didn't practice and I'm okay with that. I don't need a story around it that's what I did that's what I didn't do. I have a lot of thoughts I'm a human being, my thoughts wander that's what our thoughts. We practice, we practice a lot and our thoughts keep wondering that's what they do. Why we practice? And the more we practice more we notice how much our minds wander. And we can talk to monks who practice this all day every day and they will tell us their minds will wander because that's what human beings minds do. It's very normal. It's why everyone's having a similar experience this. Because we have to… if we're going to do this and more how to do it but if we're going to do it we do have to find a way to let go of some of the perfectionism to do this. And today we're going to focus on our thoughts. 

00:42:45
ALLISON SPARGO Our thoughts, thoughts facts. 

00:42:45
UNKNOWN Oh I need. Umm… Not always. 

00:42:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:42:55
UNKNOWN Sometimes you deduce or sometimes you think something's going to go one way and it special if you're one thing you know about the future. 

00:43:05
ALLISON SPARGO So not always, yeah. I thought specs. 

00:43:10
Linking and normalizing the challenge among group members 

00:43:10
UNKNOWN For me I will put a whole scenario in my mind about how it was going to happen before it happens and then when it happens it may be something totally different. For example okay I've to turn a paper, okay I've to cut do this, this, this, this and this, and I get (inaudible ) but my mom is like that (inaudible ) I forget to do this and then she would say in this she was talking to me and she really wasn't so for me it's like I go all the way left which could be because diagnose ADHD so could be why I go told you live with it, they didn't have to bring myself back. 

00:43:45
ALLISON SPARGO (inaudible ) you can tell us what are some of the thoughts that we will be swirling around so I know you mentioned a few already some thoughts that you carry around with you? 

00:44:00
UNKNOWN I'm thinking about what I (inaudible ), shouldn't volunteer. 

00:44:02
ALLISON SPARGO It's a thought, I should volunteer you then I (inaudible ) her down. 

00:44:05
Drawing out quiet member 

00:44:05
UNKNOWN Okay, umm… just whatever… 

00:44:10
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah, each one moment a moment as they pop up and it doesn't have to be related to anything. So right now in this moment you're thinking… 

00:44:15
UNKNOWN Where I'm potentially (inaudible ) for dinner. 

00:44:20
ALLISON SPARGO Okay, so yeah we're going to just go around the circle. You keep shouting them well just be responsible so when the thought comes we jotted down. 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN Okay. I don't (inaudible ) her right I'm thinking about how I didn't realize how markers were that allowed. I'm thinking about how, how I decided to be a part of this group. 

00:44:50
[sil.] 

00:44:55
UNKNOWN Umm… I'm thinking about how I hate situations where I can't think of the top of my head. I'm thinking about the fact that feels like I have to sneeze. 

00:45:10
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah, I need you to have another cart, I think I gets back to you. 

00:45:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. Umm… You know, I'm thinking about how good my lotion smell on my hand, oh now I'm thinking about how much of a dork I'm, 

00:45:35
[sil.] 

00:45:40
UNKNOWN Umm… You know, I'm thinking about how kind of (inaudible ) and I wish difficult little bit more of (inaudible ), 

00:45:50
[sil.] 

00:45:55
Exploring cognitions in each moment 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN Umm… thinking about how bright it is in here… 

00:46:00
[sil.] 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN …thinking about how live and it's (inauidble ), 

00:46:10
[sil.] 

00:46:15
UNKNOWN So bad. 

00:46:15
ALLISON SPARGO I'm thinking that this is so bad. As I'm going to pause your interrupt your train of thought because the moment to moment not long ago you were saying I have a check list, I have perfectionistic tendencies and those, those thoughts are all gone because you're being real in this moment and saying I like those boots that's what I'm attending to my (inaudible ) this is what I'm attending to. So what we're going to do this we're all these thoughts but these thoughts might not be relevant anymore already we have passed this moment and some of these thoughts might not be relevant right. 

00:46:45
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:46:50
ALLISON SPARGO Right, so let's see and if new thoughts pop up. If, if any of these thoughts are relevant you just begin and whoever's got it will circle you, okay. If it's something new then Dr. Blasko and I will circulate you, okay. So it's so say a new thought if one comes and say whatever thought it is there comes. And we will take time to circle you. 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:47:15
Reminder of Group Rules

00:47:25
ALLISON SPARGO But we're not going to hurt you, we're not going to hurt you. And already just remind our group of girls we're not going to be critical at you. You know I can't stop you from being critical of yourself, but I can gently remind you if you want to return to breathness or anchor. 

00:47:40
UNKNOWN Okay, okay. 

00:47:45
ALLISON SPARGO Okay. So I don't know if you stand or sit or whatever makes you feel comfortable… 

00:47:50
UNKNOWN No, standing will be fine. I think use (inaudible ). 

00:47:55
Swirling Thoughts mindfulness activity 

00:47:55
ALLISON SPARGO So for those of us if she says a thought that you have written down you're to circle her and swirl. And if it's a new thought then we'll circle you too, okay. 

00:48:00
UNKNOWN (inauidble ) 

00:48:05
ALLISON SPARGO Okay, what are you thinking? 

00:48:05

00:48:45
ALLISON SPARGO Come on honey. 

00:48:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN How's going to feel (inaudible )? I'm thinking about how I don't do when people circling around I'm so dizzy right now. 

00:49:05
ALLISON SPARGO All right, somebody let's (inaudible ). 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN Make a bigger circle… 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, all right? 

00:49:15
UNKNOWN Umm… I am thinking about how I'm thirsty but I don't want to drink any water because I have to counsel use the bathroom. 

00:49:15
ALLISON SPARGO (inaudible ). 

00:49:20
UNKNOWN You wanna turn around. 

00:49:25
[sil.] 

00:49:30
UNKNOWN I'm thinking about how I could really appreciate sitting down focusing on my breathing right now. 

00:49:40
[sil.] 

00:49:45
UNKNOWN Wait… umm… I'm thinking about how I'm nervous for ever the next session is going to be. 

00:50:00
[sil.] 

00:50:05
UNKNOWN Now I'm noticing I didn't realize how big this room was. Outside of this so goods actually pretty large room. 

00:50:15
ALLISON SPARGO And so we have all these thoughts circling. Are we circling faster? 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN Uh… Actually yeah, this isn't funny this is actually about the speed of my thoughts right about now after every few people that can really that pops into my head. 

00:50:35
ALLISON SPARGO Do you feel contained by your thoughts? 

00:50:40
UNKNOWN I do just like I do in the circle. I feel like I'm not speaking them out fast enough. 

00:50:50
ALLISON SPARGO So there are more thoughts? 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. I think that make more than I realize I do. 

00:50:55
ALLISON SPARGO Let's go one more time around and then we'll take our seats. 

00:51:05
UNKNOWN Thinking back again to how does you are making me. Umm… 

00:51:10
ALLISON SPARGO When you get back to your seat, yeah, just take… 

00:51:15
[sil.] 

00:51:20
ALLISON SPARGO And you can sit down too. 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN That was fun. 

00:51:25
ALLISON SPARGO That was fun. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN For me little dizzy. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN Little dizzy too. 

00:51:35
Processing mindfulness activities 

00:51:35
ALLISON SPARGO You watch out little bit. So it was fun it still mindfulness and that which was saying the thoughts that were in her head, you're enabling them as thoughts, right, and we were recognizing them, so that's one way that we can start the conversation around mindfulness of thoughts. So it was fun for you, right. 

00:51:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:51:50
ALLISON SPARGO Just getting up, what was, what was fun? 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN Umm… I guess this the movement and so watching (inaudible ) try to come up with thoughts, yeah. 

00:52:05
ALLISON SPARGO See her struggle little bit. 

00:52:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, I don't want to say that but that's what I was thinking. 

00:52:10
Group Leader revisits group rules and unconditional positive regard 

00:52:10
ALLISON SPARGO And it's almost just seems like touch that when I asked you to start thinking of that's, that you struggle to think of thoughts. 

00:52:15
UNKNOWN We're just (inauidble ) because I think all the time. 

00:52:20
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah, yeah. 

00:52:20
UNKNOWN And so, and I don't know if it's I was thinking more than I was saying it because I do feel like I was thinking… 

00:52:30
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN …but I was not labeling them I guess because they were literally to be something simple like oh I feel shuttle (inaudible ), Oh, this person just passed me now thinking like both the thoughts too, well, I guess (inaudible ) give more like concrete talks I guess I don't know, well (inaudible ) thoughts. 

00:52:51
ALLISON SPARGO It almost sounds like you're censoring. Yeah, okay. About everybody else did you feel like you could relate to (inaudible )? Do you sometimes have that swirl you or contain you or that you've run out of room and you're in swirling circle by the thoughts, (inaudible ). Yes, Daizy. 

00:53:10
Learning from the group process 

00:53:10
UNKNOWN I definitely (inaudible ) insist see it that way put in a different perspective for me because a few minutes there we're talking about all your thoughts backs and I was literally saying myself (inaudible ) my thoughts of facts everything I think is true. And to see it that way is making me go back and think it's really not in how many of my thought I should actually give credence to, and how much that I think about that goes to my mind that is really not necessary of the anything that I'm giving it. 

00:53:45
ALLISON SPARGO Okay. So I have to pause and think because that word credence has a critical edge to it, is that make sense? 

00:53:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:53:50
ALLISON SPARGO And I don't want to criticize you for being critical of yourself but I want to draw your awareness to that, right. And I saw you kind of laugh like I was critical of myself so even in the critic even in the, even in aware being aware of the criticalness, you are so critical and this is a pattern that I want to just demonstrate and illustrate because it's something that even seasoned people do. We get in this self-critical soft edgy spiral. And it's challenging to get out of it. We've returned to our breath is our anchor start with their heartbeat and that's where a body goes and remind ourselves. But this is mindfulness, it's a process, it's a journey and the thoughts that are swirling in the circle are going to come in and out. So really as a new thought came in we could have another one walk out because those are ones thoughts too right, they just kind of go past you. And some thoughts remain from one moment to the next moment right. Sometimes we hold on to them from one moment to the next moment, my thoughts are facts I will hold on to this, this is my thought, it is my fact. And we will consciously move it or unconsciously move it but mindfulness is just being aware that the thoughts are coming and watching them and noticing them and being open and curious, and see what happens to them., yeah. So a lot of mindfulness is internal. So that was external to help you understand what, what could be going on. Can you, are you open to practicing internally for yourself? 

00:55:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:55:20
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

00:55:20
UNKNOWN I'm afraid but I'm open. 

00:55:25
Normalizing feelings 

00:55:25
ALLISON SPARGO Mindfulness of emotions next time. And that's totally, it's totally real that you're afraid because I think you mentioned last time that without the distractions without the safety of the future being present might be uncomfortable. 

00:55:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) vulnerability. 

00:55:42
SHANE BLASKO Yeah. 

00:55:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:55:45
ALLISON SPARGO So why don't we… it's called meditation you heard that before. 

00:55:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:55:55
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

00:55:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:55:55
ALLISON SPARGO (inaudible ) said you had a diagnosis of ADHD. Sometimes people with a diagnosis of, no, even undiagnosis, not diagnosis this can be a challenge for it. Not only because it is something but also because sometimes we have other factors like biology that make it a little bit harder for us. As I'm glad that you share that and I want to all of you to notice if you go away to just try and gently nonjudgmentally bring yourself back to your breath. I'll say that when we get started as well but I want to remind you that this is a, this is a judgment free group internal and external notice that… notice the judgment, okay. All right well I've got a hope group of people ready when we started with a rose. 

00:56:45
UNKNOWN This is going to be dork for me. 

00:56:50
[sil.] 

00:56:55
SHANE BLASKO There's bravery and being willing to do things that you know are difficult, okay.

00:57:15
SHANE BLASKO We can seated with both of your feet planted on the ground, seated in an upright and dignified manner. Noticing your breath, just being aware of both your in breath and your out breath. It's paying attention to your breathing. Now in this moment… 

00:57:50
[sil.] 

00:58:05
ALLISON SPARGO You might notice that there are thoughts. Don't touch yourself for having thoughts. Be gentle with yourself. These thoughts are not facts, they're transit and experiences, they move. 

00:58:30
[sil.] 

00:58:35
ALLISON SPARGO Sometimes they stay with us from one moment to the next. 

00:58:40
[sil.] 

00:58:45
ALLISON SPARGO They're just thoughts. 

00:58:50
[sil.] 

00:58:55
ALLISON SPARGO Don't try to control the thoughts. Just notice them with open curiosity. 

00:59:05
[sil.] 

00:59:15
ALLISON SPARGO Some thoughts might be fast, some thoughts might swirl, just notice your thoughts. If you feel yourself start to be self-critical or to be distracted, return to your breath. Your breath is your achor. The in and the out, your breath is your anchor. 

01:00:00
[sil.] 

01:00:05
ALLISON SPARGO Sometimes might be pleasant, some thoughts might challenging. But these thoughts are not facts. They're just thoughts. 

01:00:20
[sil.] 

01:00:25
ALLISON SPARGO If you're pulled into the future into the past, acknowledge and accept that's where your mind went. And gently return to your breath.

ALLISON SPARGO Back to this group, smiley. 

01:01:20
Processing mindfulness meditation of thought 

01:01:20
UNKNOWN That is so hard for me, too really because I feel like I'm sitting still which I am and I can't move might now I'm trap because you have to stay here and think about nothing but just that it's so hard for me but I will keep trying. 

01:01:40
ALLISON SPARGO It's hard and in the moment you identified that it was hard. Let's.. 

01:01:50
UNKNOWN I'll keep trying I mean I can see the point though because they does when I am doing it when I first started I was able to do it for a few, you know, few minutes so it's like all this is caught me, I'm not thinking about anything, well, you know, right (inaudible ) it was like… got to think about something because that means you're not doing anything, right, if you're not thinking it's going to how I look at it. 

01:02:10
UNKNOWN I see a lot of knots, I don't know. Thinking (inaudible ) if you're not thinking about anything, you're not doing anything what's the point. 

01:02:20
UNKNOWN I mean for me this time though I don't know if I was like about to drop off into sleep but it was like I could hear you talking but it was just sound like I didn't, I wasn't really listening I guess, the focus was more in my breath. And so I don't know it was weird it, it felt like sleep. 

01:02:55
SHANE BLASKO So you stayed focused on your breath and you didn't really follow the different thoughts that you had. 

01:03:00
UNKNOWN I've did it, did it. The… 

01:03:00
UNKNOWN You're so… 

01:03:05
UNKNOWN It's never happened before so it's weird. 

01:03:10
Group cohesion around shared personal experiences 

01:03:10
UNKNOWN I'll say I had a similar experience as like I was hearing you but I wasn't because I was focused on my breath then I was thinking was my breath so shallow, my breath felt so shallow, and I thought oh, just breathing in and out through your nose and I felt bringing out of my mouth and I was like oh, I relaxed little bit once I started breathing out of mouth so I kind of notice something was (inaudible ) my breath. So I started thinking how can I breathe little better, you know, once I did that I started focusing or I felt so much better and I kind of stay there and I felt same thing hears me it was like drifting off to sleep but I was here but I don't know. 

01:03:50
UNKNOWN My eyes are little different now if I went into it with the thought I'm supposed to not but I did but it was a good thought and so I kind of kept going with that because the last thing that stay with me was that is brave to do something that you aren't… that, that you are necessarily used to doing and that you find a little scary so I held on to that (inaudible ) life where I don't know, but I did and so my went into a think like oh, I'm in this moment I'm being brave. Oh, that's good, okay. This is really good, I'm brave and I'm like well I had (inaudible ) not brave like okay no, that's not, okay then I'm like your breath is (inaudible ) I can breathe, I can breathe, okay this is good, and I kind of just stay there for a while, and my thoughts that were on my head were okay, you're brave it was more positive then just random thoughts which was nice. 

01:04:50
ALLISON SPARGO (inaudible ), a couple things, one is it's nice, nice to hear that you too have a shared experience and you too that it was different than what you expected it to be, right you expected it to be a comfortable around pleasant (inaudible ) I mean your period was shorter but you expected it to be something that when you got into. That original thought it was not a fact right, it was different, yeah. 

01:05:25
UNKNOWN It definitely feels more comfortable to or more calming I guess to not think then to be thinking. I guess just like (inaudible ) hear, just relaxing. 

01:05:40
ALLISON SPARGO I feel like group is different, do you feel like our group is little different? 

01:05:40
UNKNOWN I think it is to me. 

01:05:45
ALLISON SPARGO How can you do that? The group felt so calm, doesn't it? 

01:05:50
[sil.] 

01:05:55
Drawing out quiet members 

01:05:55
ALLISON SPARGO I also hear that several of you returned to your breath even if you did hear me to say it our loud well consciously, you remember to return to your breath. So the time our last session with this session your breath is your anchor, and it will be with you for ever. And it is something that you can return to when you experience your thoughts whirling in a way that's different or feelings or even if you just want to take a moment and try to practice mindfulness. Stop it(inaudible ). I'm curious about you to (inaudible ) require at this time around what was it like for you to have not only a breath as something to be aware. 

01:06:40
UNKNOWN I noticed my breath more this time than my actual heart beat but it was a little bit of a fight between the two. Umm… But definitely my breath help my heart this time. 

01:06:50
ALLISON SPARGO And any thoughts? 

01:06:55
UNKNOWN Just bringing them little things… 

01:06:55
ALLISON SPARGO Then they kind of floated by. 

01:07:00
UNKNOWN I felt like I was trying to correct what I did like wrong last time, so I felt like last time I just focused on my heart beat some of the breath. It was like I came and focused on the breath and then I was like just repeating to myself like inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale or whatever, and then I was like and so to be focused on my breathing and so then my thoughts were like oh why is so different this time, what's different umm… and stuff like that I still was trying I didn't get to the like nonjudgmental part of my thoughts because I was still judging them as they came. So I guess I was a little disappointed myself I was like I would rather just go back to the heart and that was a little easier like then acknowledging like why am I trying so hard for this and… 

01:07:45
UNKNOWN It was kind of the same for me initially like that the whole breathe in, breathe out, in out, in out is what I was thinking, gonna thought in out is a thought and then it kind of just one way and it was just me breathing which was awesome. 

01:08:05
UNKNOWN And I can relate but in a different way like I… this was this time was very different than the first time. But I feel I don't in a good way for me and so I now think like why this time different than the first time. But after some reason I don't really have that interest that kind of ahead of our lives or think about it as much, I'm like okay, it was different it was good. 

01:08:35
Infusing CBT into group process 

01:08:35
ALLISON SPARGO Thank you guys, you're getting it. And Carolyn I still hear that you're, you're moving and practicing but remaining open in a, in a curious way to Gosh, there I'm judging, Gosh there I'm judging than I'm judging great that cycle that I mentioned before, and so we each develop our own peace right. Kind of along the same lines we're probably all like different foods right, some people like pizzas, some people like carbs, so they like sweets right. The same thing is true for mindfulness you will just go to a place that is natural for you and your body. Somebody is like carbs, some taste buds like carbs, some brains like to judge right and so we have these natural preferences but that doesn't mean that it's the only thing that we're going to partake of right. We just had to learn to like broccoli right, learned to like broccoli and other things right. So to continue to practice as mindfulness of breathing of breath and then if you get a chance to say, hey, I was critical there but that's okay, instead of I was critical, (inaudible ) is critical, (inaudible ) is critical. So to stop the pattern if, if you see it happening but it sounds like already we've got a couple people who have made the transition at least today in this session about I don't have to be critical. You seem so calm over here. 

01:09:55
UNKNOWN I mea, I mean like (inaudible ) I don't know it's, it's no experience for me so I guess I'm excited to have something new that I can do moving forward. 

01:10:05
ALLISON SPARGO So let's talk about moving forward right because you know the homework assignment is going to be to practice right. So at a minimum practice, what umm… I know we talked about some thoughts that might be something blocks, you have any, any ideas on how you might use this moving forward? 

01:10:30
UNKNOWN Yeah I think it'll… I think it will allow me to remove myself from thinking that I have to think about what's next. And then I can just kind of relax myself and calm down, and put myself in a place of whatever like that will be my attitude whatever. 

01:10:55
ALLISON SPARGO I'm smiling because I think that the in our initial session I said you have a choice then you're just saying right now that you have a choice you can think about whatever, we can think about whatever right. 

01:11:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:11:05
UNKNOWN I think moving forward is for help me because oftentimes with my thoughts I would hold on to them and each thought would kind of build upon each thought and so now when I'm being mindful of what I'm thinking I can just really say to myself, okay this isn't a fact, okay it's a thought it comes and goes, and to just really being my fault that the next moment (inaudible ) have something else but I'll have to take the pressure off of myself which is nice for me going forward. 

01:11:45
ALLISON SPARGO I see some nods, even (inaudible ) nodding at the same (inaudible ). 

01:11:50
UNKNOWN Yeah I think that's the biggest thing I just being okay with whatever that moment is, I mean because the things (inaudible ) happy moment, yeah I did great on this test or this paperback and I got the A and I thought I failed or you know on the sports team and we won the game like it's easy to celebrate those moments and want to stay in those moments for ever but even those moments come and go and so just learning to be in whatever the moment is umm… but it's those bad not so good moments that it's hard to just be okay, whatever that is or even nothing moments (inaudible ) focusing on my breathing like being okay whatever the moment is learning to just stay there. 

01:12:40
[sil.] 

01:12:45
Check out 

01:12:45
ALLISON SPARGO Okay. So let's spend a minute or two just checking out from the group this afternoon. Umm… Next time we're going to pick up with mindfulness of emotions so we're going to we're going to use the same tenants if you will that we're going to be fully present with our emotions. So that's what we're going to do next I see eyebrows are ready up, they can be scary but so were thoughts when we started we thought it was going to be scary the thoughts are not facts and transit same with emotions. So let's not be worried about the future right now, right. So as a check out where how about a word? She's aware that would describe your present moment right now. 

01:13:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:13:30
UNKNOWN Calm. 

01:13:35
UNKNOWN As (inauidble ) say calm. 

01:13:40
UNKNOWN Anxious. 

01:13:45
UNKNOWN Different. 

01:13:45
UNKNOWN Pleasant. 

01:13:50
UNKNOWN Relaxed. 

01:13:50
ALLISON SPARGO And energized. 

01:13:55
SHANE BLASKO Calm. 

01:14:00
ALLISON SPARGO Calm. Well again we're going to leave here in this moment and we'll pick back up at another. So I want to thank you for the call of playing for playing today, I know what, we're, we're asking you to do something very different and it is very brave to try something new especially when it doesn't wholly make sense but you guys are doing it and you're seeing some of that the changes that come, come about. So I look forward to more open and curious faces for next time (inaudible ) mindfulness of emotions, okay. Thank you, guys.

Part 2: The Young Adult Group 

01:14:35
Chapter Seven: 

01:14:35
The Third Session Focusing on Mindfulness of Emotions 

01:14:40
UNKNOWN Hi, we're back with Dr. Spargo and Dr. Blasko to discuss the first two sessions that we just that we just watched. Hi Allison and Shane, so you got some really interesting responses to teaching CBT and mindfulness activities to adolescents and I'm really excited to hear about those. Umm… I notice you start with a breathing exercise, could you tell me about that? 

01:15:00
SHANE BLASKO Sure. So the reason why we chose to start with the breathing activity was because breathing is really a foundational building block of learning mindfulness. It's I mean it's a concentration meditation to focus on the breathing but doing so really helps umm… helps us get that sense of what it is to really focus and on a part of the body and really just get that practice of okay. So I'm focusing on my body and I'm getting a sense of these bodily sensations, it is and it's just so foundational I mean it's something that we can practice anywhere, any time and so we really wanted to, really wanted to start this group with this very foundational umm… activity. 

01:15:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, I think oftentimes when you think about mindfulness you do think about breathing. So, is breathing mindfulness? 

01:15:55
SHANE BLASKO Technically it's not, no, what it is, is it's really, it's a first step and getting to that place of where you're going to be calm mindfulness, get to a place of mindfulness meditation. 

01:16:05
UNKNOWN Okay great, and so let's talk about some of the group dynamics that were going on in the room. 

01:16:10
ALLISON SPARGO So I think in any group you're going to you're going to expect kind of the stages of a group process, you're going to expect some forming, you're going to expect some norming, you know expect some storming. Umm… In these first two sessions I think there was a little bit of that so they definitely relied on assets as more of a facilitator role um, especially because, you know, it is the psychoeducational group. So we are in some ways kind of teaching them what it is to have a mindfulness based CBT experience. And so I'm seemed to great job leading them through of mindfulness of breath and I think because of that they really looked to, to share the (inaudible ) when they were processing the experience there was a little bit of resistance about why I didn't do it right, and I think that that's, that's a really normal experience of learning anything new to my doing it right wanting to have some sort of like an awareness of, you know, that how am I doing. And so I think that, that led to an opportunity for group cohesion with this particular group, several you could see several people nodding yeah, if I'm not sure if I did it or when I was doing I was uncomfortable so it was a little bit of agreement there between our group members. There were some more vocal members there were some less vocal members and I think that that led itself to are encouraging some people to maybe speak more and maybe not making as much eye contact with those group members or not attending to them trying to maybe use our subtle nonverbal skills to, to discourage or to kind of to provide opportunities for some of our more quiet members to speak and to share their experiences. 

01:17:45
UNKNOWN Okay so even though this group had a specific focus which is teaching mindfulness based CBT activities, I know you're saying you're still using those basic group facilitation skills, so cutting off, drawing out and here paying attention to all the interactions that are going on your group. 

01:18:00
ALLISON SPARGO Yes. 

01:18:00
UNKNOWN Okay. And you mentioned that there was some focus on am I doing it right which I agree is a universal human experience we want to know that we're doing something new correctly. Do you think that might have been even more salient in an adolescent group? 

01:18:15
SHANE BLASKO Absolutely I think because of the fact that they're adolescents not only are they questioning am I doing it right, there's also the sense I want to be doing it right which also leads to some resistance if I'm not going to be doing it right and they don't want to do it at all which may be related to the fact that I think almost every one of them admitted to including myself having a sense of perfectionism which may or may not be related to the fact they were adolescence but maybe just human beings. 

01:18:40
UNKNOWN Sure, sure. I'm wondering how that seems like a difficult thing to navigate like how do you create the safety and reassure the group members and at the same time emphasize that we're not evaluating what we're doing here that we're just experiencing in accepting it. 

01:19:00
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah, and I think that this group was a little bit for me slower to start I was I guess you know I'm always hopeful I'm always well prepared for a group and so I guess I was excited I was so excited about the (inaudible ) that I was like you know if I give it to them they're going to just jump on this bandwagon and be so they're all about it too. And they were but I think because there was that fear of evaluation, you know, there was some hesitancy as well. And I think once we navigated that in the group session and just you know we brought it too late, we talked about what is it like to be in this group where you're doing this interpersonal navigation and you know the only person who's criticizing you is yourself, nobody else is doing that. I think once we spent some time exploring that in their group and really getting feedback from one another that they really started to gel together and to latch on to the material and really want more from us. 

01:19:50
UNKNOWN Sure so it's not like you were kind of quickly working through some of the group stages what did you see occurring? 

01:20:00
ALLISON SPARGO Umm… There was definitely like I said the forming there was a little bit of storming in that they were there was some initial resistance to what we were providing for them from the psychoeducational standpoint. 

01:20:10
SHANE BLASKO Right. 

01:20:10
ALLISON SPARGO And you'll see in the second group session that we did an activity and you'll see just a truncated part Um… as far as um, a very hands on experience of demonstrating the mindfulness of thoughts, and there was a lot of hesitancy about what am I doing and how am I doing… 

01:20:25
SHANE BLASKO Right. 

01:20:25
ALLISON SPARGO …and mindfulness based CBT is not about giving specific directions or interventions outside of, you know, those four categories I mentioned before and so letting the group kind of struggle and find out how they were going to do that was, was interesting as a facilitator and I felt an urge going to jump in and do it for them but we know that's not our job and so just let the group have that space and the time to figure out for themselves how they're going to make meaning out of this material. 

01:20:50
UNKNOWN Sure but that doesn't seem like a very important characteristic of a successful group facilitator for this particular type of group is being comfortable with that ambiguity in that maybe even uncomfortable silence or tension in the moment sometimes. 

01:21:05
SHANE BLASKO Yeah it's not only important for a group leader but it's a particularly important piece actually of mindfulness is sitting with discomfort actually. So is something that we, we actually as practitioners of mindfulness and mindfulness based CBT have actually we work with ourselves quite a bit so… 

01:21:25
UNKNOWN So it's helpful to you your own practice of mindfulness it's helpful to you in that way also. 

01:21:25
SHANE BLASKO Absolutely, yeah. So our group members in that second session actually got to work on it in a more external version of working with the thoughts and then the more internal exercise and looking at their own thoughts and then they, they struggled quite a bit, they struggled little with the external version of the activity because it was, was very new for all of them and ambiguous and then several of the several in the group members struggled with the internal one as well. 

01:22:00
UNKNOWN Thank you, it was there anything that came up during the group that was any anticipated or a little surprising to as facilitators? 

01:22:10
ALLISON SPARGO I think umm… I don't know if it was unanticipated or unexpected necessarily but just being aware of the developmental space and which are adolescents for and, and I think that goes back to just because I'm thrilled about the material just because we're thrilled about the material doesn't make an adolescent thrilled about the material. And so umm… you'll notice in the group that there were some people who uh… you know, weren't as engaged in the material and umm… maybe even like disengaged from the material. There were some nodding heads here and there, and during the process or it of it there was a discussion of, you know, I was relaxed. Well if you're relaxed are you still engaged in their group and so that was that was something that as facilitators was, you know, it's not unexpected but it is something to just kind of attends to as far as at what level do we want the engagement to be. 

01:23:05
UNKNOWN Sure. So it sounds like that's really one of the benefits that we're getting today is seeing actual group participants instead of actors as we do have those things that are likely to occur in any group setting where you might have someone not off or… 

01:23:15
ALLISON SPARGO Right. 

01:23:20
UNKNOWN umm… you know, their attention drift away from the group for a moment and figuring out how to gently bring them back in and really engage them. 

01:23:25
SHANE BLASKO Yes. 

01:23:25
UNKNOWN Okay great. Anything else you would like to share about these sessions? 

01:23:30
SHANE BLASKO And something else that I found surprising um, was and the second um, mindfulness of thought activity umm… something that was unanticipated for me we had one of our members mentioned although he said that he thought maybe he was drifting off to sleep, he said that on that he didn't have any thoughts which was not something that I was anticipating any of our group members saying because while that was his experience umm… it was not something that I was expecting I was anticipating any of our members having that experience, it's not something that I have encountered before. 

01:24:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:24:15
ALLISON SPARGO And I think it's valid to point out that, you know, all of these participants are sharing their own unique experiences 

01:24:20
SHANE BLASKO Exactly. 

01:24:20
ALLISON SPARGO …this is a process, this is umm… one that we're going to engage in for our life journey once you start thinking about mindfulness based CBT and it is unusual for someone to say, you know, what I sat there I was mindful of my breath, I use it as my anchor but I was not I was not noticing any sort of thought or emotion. There's not it doesn't happen that frequently and so it is a little surprising to have somebody get so present in the moment that they were using mindfulness based CBT to the point where there's no judgment, there is no thought, there was nothing to distract them from their breath. 

01:24:55
UNKNOWN So in some ways they really got to the ultimate goal, it sounds like that how you perceive it. 

01:25:00
ALLISON SPARGO I think so I mean I think in, in that particular instance that personal experience was yeah I didn't have any thoughts, now I think as facilitators and facilitators of adolescence in particular, there's always the question of well, were you engaged or were you sleeping, were you doing what we were asking you to or were you doing something different so I think that all of those factors are kind of going into it but I, I feel like for that particular participant there was so (inaudible ). 

01:25:27
UNKNOWN That it was a powerful mindfulness based experience okay. 

01:25:30
SHANE BLASKO And he clearly described it as a very powerful experience for him and I think that's what's most important. 

01:25:35
UNKNOWN Is how he interpreted that. 

01:25:35
SHANE BLASKO Exactly. 

01:25:40
UNKNOWN Okay, great. Well, what are we about to see in the last two sessions? 

01:25:40
ALLISON SPARGO Well, we can pick up with, with that particular experience because it was so meaningful for him in the second session he is striving to get back there for the third. So I think we're going to see a little bit of more struggle from that particular participant as far as trying to manage and trying to get back in the frustration and the disappointment if he if he's not able to get there, and the excitement if he is. So I think that's one of the things that we can keep our eyes open for as viewers to look and see just because we have something in one session doesn't mean that it's going to occur or that we've mastered it in the in the future sessions. 

01:26:10
UNKNOWN Sure. 

01:26:15
ALLISON SPARGO Additionally we're going to add layers so we did our mindfulness of breath and we then added our mindfulness of thoughts. And next we're going to take the CBT aspect into mindfulness of emotional reactions and then in the fourth session we're going to tie it all together we're going to talk about what is it like to have a breath as our grounding and to have our thoughts just kind of drift and not be judgments of them and then our mindfulness of feelings again not having them tied to anything in particular and experience them in their full comfort or discomfort whatever that happens to be and then also moving the material from what we're doing in these groups into the outside environment, and see how to how we're going to do that maybe what might be some challenges that get in the way of our moving this material on those types of those types of items that are, you know, really involved in any group that you're going to work with. 

01:27:00
UNKNOWN Okay great let's take a look. 

01:27:05
ALLISON SPARGO Hi Guys welcome back again. So I know we had some big growth last time right, mindfulness of thoughts. 

01:27:10
UNKNOWN Oh yeah. 

01:27:15
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. Anything between last session and the session that you would like to review or revisit? 

01:27:25
UNKNOWN Umm… I can say that nothing has changed whenever I do the breathing exercise is being aware of my breath I'm still aware. I'm able to not think. So on side of it, it was just like a one time thing or an in-the moment thing you have been able to repeat it. 

01:27:45
UNKNOWN I'm now aware of how much I am aware and sometimes it's good and sometimes it's gets on my nerves because I don't want to be aware of every everything but then I have to kind of catch myself like I'm okay, it's okay. And I think that was difficult for me is the part that you have to be okay with whatever is in the moment… 

01:28:10
UNKNOWN That will judgment… 

01:28:10
UNKNOWN …yeah I don't… I'm working on that, it's difficult. 

01:28:15
UNKNOWN For me I did it I put a little twist on mine because I know the longer I go the easiest for me to lose hope. So I start off do in one minute, two minutes to kind of work myself up and it works better for me that way so not try to do it five minutes or do it three minutes but just take a minute and stop and do it, and so it really worked for me. 

01:28:40
UNKNOWN I'm becoming more aware of my breathing a lot more aware of our breathing actually which helps me to not think, I focus on the breathing I stop thinking and if I do think it's just about the breathing. So that's been helpful, less stressful, so… 

01:29:05
Group leader self discloses and provides a recommendation to group members 

01:29:05
Group leader offers a subtle confrontation 

01:29:05
ALLISON SPARGO And just something about our group process so I know they're, you know, Dr. Blasko and I are the facilitators but that's really what we are we're a facilitator. So I've noticed that this particular group looks at me and looks at Dr. Blasko and you talk to me, and you talk to Dr. Blasko so I want to encourage you if you're comfortable to also talk to each other, right. So I scanned the room, right. And that's to see who is connecting with you so if you're looking at me you might be missing somebody nodding along right. So I would like you to encourage intention going to pick on you for a minute because you said that and the that you were looking for feedback in some ways. So if you're looking for feedback you've got an opportunity in this group to reach out for it if you want to. And you have an opportunity (inaudible ) said has invited you scariest to give her feedback. Feedback is my word but to see if you are if you've all experienced you the way that you feel you are right. And each of you came in with a goal of some sort of, you know, learning about yourself but also in the group context. So I guess I just want to spend that one moment talking about the process of this group that you don't have to look to Dr. Blasko and I we're not your teachers like in class, we're facilitators that way what facilitate your group. 

01:30:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) look that any of you. 

01:30:40
Group leader reviews and summarizes session 

01:30:40
ALLISON SPARGO And there isn't any right or wrong so if you look at me I'm going to be if you're talking I'm going to be looking at you but I'm also going to be scanning and Dr. Blasko will do the same thing. So I don't want you to feel pressured to do one thing or another but I do want you to have the opportunity just like I would like you to have the choice of being mindful or being in the future. I want you to have the choice of speaking to your facility or speaking to your group members right, it's up to you, you can decide. So today which our mindfulness of emotions so you use a little bit of the information from the first session the breathing, we added onto it the mindfulness of thoughts, we got some relief little bit of disappointment but either way one step at a time one present moment at a time and today mindfulness of emotions so last time even though we were talking there were a lot of words anxiety, stress, gratitude, joy, you know, like that there, there were a lot of different varieties of emotions and so today we're going to spend some time be coming mind full of them, so on board, yeah, okay. 

01:31:45
Group leader structures session 

01:31:45
SHANE BLASKO So we touched on in the first group this idea that we, we have a tendency towards avoiding our emotions, umm… towards avoiding being vulnerable, umm… planning, umm… looking at a future, keeping things scheduled so that we can control things so that we can avoid feeling uh, some of what we write or some of we refer to as some of those unpleasant emotions be it anxiety, be it sadness anything that's uncomfortable. We all have our own idea of what is uncomfortable and we all have different reasons for not wanting to have those experiences, some of us just don't want to feel that way, some of us may be afraid that if we start to feel that way, may not, may not be able to stop feeling that way. So, so we keep doing that we keep trying to control, we keep trying to plan we keep trying to avoid escape doing all, all of the things that we're doing. And in doing so what we end up doing is we end up carrying this painful stuff with us. And not really dealing with in, in getting through what we're avoiding experiencing. So one of the things that mindfulness of emotions can do is it can help us with experiencing our emotions as they come up in the moment. So we're not going to be doing this we're not going to be trying to bring up all the emotions and try and process through them. Or we're going to be working on is how to actually experience our emotions as they come out. So whatever emotion that is that you're having now experience it as it comes up. And or gently noticing that you're not ready to because some of us are not yet ready to have that experience yet and we're still working towards getting there. So when you go through this activity today not everyone in this room is going to be ready to embrace that emotion. It's the goal to get there but we're not all going to be there, just in a nonjudgmental, non-critical way noticing where we are. And we're going, you know, working towards being there. So… 

01:34:40
UNKNOWN This by far has to be the most nerve racking of all of the exercises we have planned. 

01:34:45
SHANE BLASKO Yeah. 

01:34:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:34:50
SHANE BLASKO How are you feeling right now? 

01:34:50
UNKNOWN Afraid, very afraid. I mean it's good to know that we're not going to be working out stuff from the past I mean it just not that intense and just but who knows what's going to happen (inaudible ). Because what we're thinking now may make us think about something that happened in the past and then just down little from there, yeah. 

01:35:15
[sil.] 

01:35:20
Group leader solicits group members feeling of university 

01:35:20
UNKNOWN All other people having similar fears I'm just anxious… 

01:35:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:35:25
UNKNOWN …I'm just like can we just I don't know (inaudible ) happen, so we could just get to whatever is happening that will be great. 

01:35:35
UNKNOWN The best (inaudible ) I guess we're not living in a moment because here again and I'm like oh no come on, say it when we need to do but I'm not in the moment like wait my (inaudible ) going to come. 

01:35:46
UNKNOWN I'll jump in the boat with the guys because I'm the same area I'm anxious. 

01:35:50
UNKNOWN I don't know how to feel at all. Oh no, I have no idea how to feel I think I will(inaudible ) slightly relieved when you say we're not going to dig our past things then Jeremy mentioned how thinking about something presently will bring up oh (inaudible ) anxious all over again so I don't know how to feel right now. 

01:36:12
UNKNOWN You welcome. 

01:36:15
[sil.] 

01:36:20
ALLISON SPARGO And Maya is right because if you're anxious about what will happen or what might happen then you're not being present in the moment unless you're saying I'm anxious, I feel anxious right now that you have all these stories around the anxiety right. 

01:36:35
Group leader reinforces it's ok to accept feelings 

01:36:40
SHANE BLASKO But, but, but mindfulness of emotion present in the moment can be as simple as now I'm feeling anxious and where my feeling that anxiety like getting in touch with in my body where am I feeling it… 

01:36:55
UNKNOWN Right in my throat. 

01:36:55
SHANE BLASKO (inaudible ) it's like my throat feeling like it's closing up, and our thoughts that come along with it. I can't breathe is that a thought that comes along with anxiety and, and I'm going to die, I'm going to die, and because whatever thought or, or this has to end whatever thoughts whatever physical sensations you get this coming along with your anxiety right now in this moment that awareness of all of it and with each thought that comes with it, okay. Saying okay to each one not okay, this is great I love feeling this way but okay this is happening right now, acknowledge this is happening. This is part of my current experience that is mindfulness of emotion. I am currently having this experience and allowing it to happen. 

01:38:00
UNKNOWN So it's not necessarily wrong I guess. If it's a physical feeling that… 

01:38:05
SHANE BLASKO It's, it's not wrong at all. It's, it, it is physical feelings and we, we, we all experience our emotions, we need to experience it that the similar motion differently so the way that I will… we could four of us right here could, could each say we're all experiencing anxiety and we will experience it in four different parts of our body and associated with different thoughts so, so I may not have any part of my mind that's feeling it right now but stay (inaudible ) may say one feeling I wish at her throat. So we will have a throat. But then (inaudible ) saying same one feeling it in, in my lower back and in my shoulders she's feeling in different places and… and I need might saying well I'm feeling in my stomach it's on a stomach and we all have different places where it's going it's because she's feeling in her stomach today and I'm just making up for them. I mean (inaudible )everywhere she's feeling it in ten minutes when she's feeling a different anxiety, and then each of our anxieties in each different moment going to have different thoughts (inaudible ) because my anxiety about a particular test may have certain catastrophic type thoughts around it but my anxiety about my relationship or my parents may come with all sorts of other different types of catastrophic type thoughts or non-catastrophic type thoughts. Is that make sense? 

01:39:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:39:35
Group leader reminds memebers to refrain from judgemental wording 

01:39:35
ALLISON SPARGO Into those words good and bad are labeled their label words, but they're also judgmental kind of words right. It means something so instead of may be good or bad can we use the words pleasant or unpleasant, comfortable or uncomfortable because those are simply part of the experience they're not so describing good and bad. 

01:39:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:40:00
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. I have to point out too I know you guys also have the first session that you have a tendency to leap forward to the future going to all of these things right. If I could remind you and I know it's not mindfulness oriented but it is a group process oriented that last time we met there was a lot of anxiety about mindfulness of thoughts, we did the activity and then there was a sense of relief. So instead of thinking back to a more pleasant experience, we're hanging on to the anxiety of the future and we're not fortune tellers. We're not fortune tellers. 

01:40:30
UNKNOWN Which is like… 

01:40:35
UNKNOWN Yeah I was like (inaudible ) 

01:40:37
UNKNOWN All right and I really did and that's something that I think I can take away from all of this is that instead of having all this invest that emotion over something that I do, I don't know what's gonna happen or you know just been all the energy there I can really just refer to a pleasant moment. You know and I, you know, I had similar experience where I did not know and it turned out well is that oh my God I don't know. This is ridiculous I'm going to hate it, it's going to be horrible, oh God. 

01:41:20
ALLISON SPARGO You have a third choice so you just identify… 

01:41:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible )… 

01:41:21
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah, can anybody help her what's the third choice she, she can jump to the future and feel the anxiety or the all those things that you just said, note to the past and draw from what could be a pleasant experience… 

01:41:35
UNKNOWN Or leave in the moments. 

01:41:35
UNKNOWN Stay right. 

01:41:40
[sil.] 

01:41:45
ALLISON SPARGO I think you just jump to the future again. 

01:41:50
UNKNOWN I did. 

01:41:50
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah, and that's okay because we're not going to be critical, and if we are… 

01:41:55
UNKNOWN That's okay too. 

01:41:55
ALLISON SPARGO That's okay too. And again I know we say this all the time right Dr. Blasko there is a process and you're not going to learn in forward group sessions with us. You're going to get a tidbit and if you practice it you might get a little bit more but it's a lifelong journey and I know you looked at me like I had four eyes last time I said that but it is a lifelong journey, it's a developmental process so just like you continue to grow in your emotions will shift and change in your life will look different here and there. You will look different if you integrate some mindfulness into your life too. 

01:42:30
UNKNOWN Great. 

01:42:35
ALLISON SPARGO So already you're seeing that it can change pieces of yourself just from these two groups sessions that we've gotten so far right. So imagine if you continue to practice for a lifetime what your life line look like. You will have three choices for each moment. 

01:42:50
[sil.] 

01:42:55
ALLISON SPARGO I'm seeing the smiles, do you see the smiles? 

01:43:00
UNKNOWN It's truly something to think about like, I don't think I've ever felt thought about it like that I guess if that makes any sense it's always at everything I do I have to do for a reason or I have to achieve something it's not okay I'm already doing right now. It's (inaudible ) what am I going to do later, why am I doing this right now so it can help me later. And so I guess is to think about well if I just really stop and say, I'm going to live for the moment or you know, think about that what you know what have a right to start to look at it instead of because I'm on my worst critic I for everything, anything everything so this is going to kind of different for me, I'm going to, and I'm going to try it because it seems like it will ease a lot of mush tourists that are bringing lots of myself. 

01:43:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) a lot of relief and like just knowing that you don't have to care as much as wreck this is that saying, if feels good, yeah. 

01:44:05
UNKNOWN It's (inaudible ) cynical like you were not in did you like agree kind of what, what I was saying what… 

01:44:10
UNKNOWN And then I'm like yes it does the feels great in my care but then like my mom like you slacker, who does that? 

01:44:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:44:15
UNKNOWN Who's this? It feels great not so clear that is ridiculous. I'm like oh you're judging like come on this is whole big thing but it does and I think I have to be okay with the fact that I think it is okay to say that it feels good not to, not to care. 

01:44:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:44:40
UNKNOWN But for me not just (inaudible ) because they're not feel like how you, not you got a care but I don't care so a certain extent I guess if that makes sense for me, I don't know. That's makes me feel better. 

01:44:55
ALLISON SPARGO And sometimes it can feel really heavy because you get in the cycle I mean I'm hearing your cycle and then heads are nodding and it's totally like wait, wait I was control little bit like a whole new way and it might feel like the swirling right, the swirling thoughts. 

01:45:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:45:12
UNKNOWN (inaudible )says Nicole said that I was like okay maybe I can (inaudible ). 

01:45:17
UNKNOWN Exactly, like (inaudible ) I don't care so let me taught I beg out there because I do care little bit. 

01:45:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) care little bit. But it isn't not good to say that. 

01:45:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:45:30
[sil.] 

01:45:35
ALLISON SPARGO So shall we practice some, some mindfulness of emotions. 

01:45:40
UNKNOWN Oh God. 

01:45:40
UNKNOWN Ready. 

01:45:45

01:45:50

01:46:00
[sil.] 

01:46:05
SHANE BLASKO As we sit in an upright and dignified posture, let the sound of the bells bring us back to the present moment. We can began by focusing back to our breath, focusing on our in breath, and the out breath. 

01:46:35
[sil.] 

01:46:45
SHANE BLASKO And remembering that if we need to we can always go back to focusing on our breath as our anchor. 

01:46:55
[sil.] 

01:47:05
SHANE BLASKO During this meditation today going to pay attention to any feelings that we may be experiencing. Just noticing what emotions we are experiencing… 

01:47:30
[sil.] 

01:47:45
SHANE BLASKO Noticing where in our body we are experiencing them. 

01:47:55
[sil.] 

01:48:20
SHANE BLASKO We're also aware of the thoughts that were having a while with the emotions. 

01:48:30
[sil.] 

01:49:10
SHANE BLASKO As we gently remind ourselves not to judge our experience, just pay attention to what it is we are experiencing, and where it is that we are experiencing it. 

01:49:40
[sil.] 

01:50:15
[music] 

01:50:30
[sil.] 

01:50:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, it was some (inaudible ). Oh, well, I was really able to control my thoughts almost if that that makes sense like a little bit. 

01:51:00
UNKNOWN Are you sure? 

01:51:05
UNKNOWN I am because I never because I where they always like but this time it was like and it bells back off like it going to try to come in, but in bells off. That is so I'm going to tell you what I thought about, you know, was last few minutes, you know, weird. 

01:51:20
UNKNOWN Sounds good. 

01:51:25
UNKNOWN I'm always pointed because for me like for me this time and I know we're not supposed to compare but from last session there was there relief and I guess feeling accomplished that I was able to just focus on my breathing but I didn't really I guess feel anything so I guess I was expecting for there to just be this emotion that was going to be there when we did the exercise and there really wasn't. So actually I got didn't really experience anything that makes any sense, you know. I'm disappointed by (inaudible ). 

01:52:15
UNKNOWN I'm (inaudible ) feeling. 

01:52:20
UNKNOWN Feel (inaudible ). 

01:52:25
UNKNOWN And I feel little better now. I know I really do. 

01:52:30
UNKNOWN Oh wow. 

01:52:30
UNKNOWN Thank you, yeah. 

01:52:35
[sil.] 

01:52:40
UNKNOWN I felt very in tune with myself and very peaceful which is something that I have not felt in a very long time and so at first I was like there has to be that's not the right emotion. And so I was very critical of myself like there should be something else you should be feeling then what you're feeling. And I was like oh that's nonsense I like this I'm going to stay here and I just kind of said whatever expectation I had I just don't let that go. I was like whatever it is, is going to be what it is. And I think that was the best thing I could have done like what is called are your (inaudible ) like I felt like my whatever is connected to my heart beat in my head I felt it. I… that was the best thing ever for me. 

01:53:35
UNKNOWN And so, you know, I'm disappointed again because I didn't feel any of that I didn't, I didn't feel like this thing right there was nothing and to like there was thoughts came back this time because I'm thinking to myself I should be feeling something but I'm not. 

01:53:50
SHANE BLASKO What was your expectation now? 

01:53:55
UNKNOWN That there was going to be I guess just a slew of emotions just everywhere that I'm just going to be feeling emotional and… 

01:54:05
UNKNOWN So you want to get choked up? 

01:54:10
UNKNOWN I mean no but. I just I guess something was suppose I thought something was supposed to happen… 

01:54:15
UNKNOWN On a deeper level than what it did. 

01:54:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. And it didn't, I don't think it did. 

01:54:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) so often about. 

01:54:26
UNKNOWN Oh no you (inauidble ) loses for the local fight that's what you fear and so would you referring to happen didn't happen now you're just so frankly but it makes sense though. Because I had a similar experience I was expecting like this like overflow of emotions but that I was like oh what is about to happen, when I felt you and the bells came out I was like that's the, the only emotion I feel (inaudible ) I was like oh my God like we've go the bells like who knows what happens once the bell rings like and then I close my eyes, then I just want to say, okay, are you okay, this is like there was no emotion per say I actually found myself going back to the other sessions like feeling what was going on in my body and thinking about the thoughts as opposed to the emotional side of it. So I can, I can relate to what you're saying I don't know I don't know maybe but I guess it makes sense a lot of times we have the expectation of what's going to happen and then we in the moment like you said before and it ever happened that way disappointment comes in and I guess this is now I see if I would not have had an expectation back in that previous moment it would have changed how I felt this one. 

01:55:40
UNKNOWN And you said, you said like when you after the bells you would just like okay, I feel okay, and that was the thoughts that I had was like okay, I feel okay would does that an emotion and so, it's just disappointment because I guess, I guess because the thoughts were there I guess I felt like I was supposed to be thinking and it just, it just completely went away from the whole emotion thing I was back to thoughts in thoughts are not supposed to be there when we're doing activities like this it just crashed. 

01:56:20
UNKNOWN But you know that is that's those trying to be perfectionists feel like we did something wrong because we didn't feel any emotions so that's all I hope you're thinking why you're doing this wrong because think that you don't feel anything this is now this is supposed to go but I think that's there's that whole profession being a perfectionist then saying, okay there's a right and wrong way to do it. And the right way would have been to fill in the emotion and especially tends the emotion and the wrong way is that not feeling anything wrong, when I guess it's a matter of pleasant and unpleasant maybe it would have been pleasant for us to feel some type of emotion but it was unpleasant felt like we should have… 

01:56:55
UNKNOWN Well, maybe that was my emotion, it was unpleasant because I didn't feel anything. So it was an unpleasant feeling of just like being in this moment. This moment is unpleasant to me. I'm not disappointed anymore. 

01:57:15
UNKNOWN So nobody else saying anything… And I don't know if certain exercises because the first one like thoughts I was like emotions for me I'm like okay I do have some emotional stuff going on today. So for that one that might have been my one piece because I did have but (inaudible ) unlike my fault I go lot of place so here I go. Pretty emotional one of my have emotions going on so for me you see like that one kind of real me and more than the thoughts… 

01:57:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:57:45
UNKNOWN …for me though. 

01:57:50
Group leader provides an observation/self disclosure 

01:57:50
ALLISON SPARGO And you guys can see I was watching you (inaudible ) because you was tapping during the thoughts activity and that's when you were incredibly still and you came back and I thought you had tears in your eyes… 

01:58:00
UNKNOWN I did, I did, I did, I was there. 

01:58:00
ALLISON SPARGO And for somebody who has biological ADHD then I must've been pretty powerful… 

01:58:10
UNKNOWN I was, I was, I was some… but weird like what, what some on bells… 

01:58:20
(crosstalk) 

01:58:25
UNKNOWN And mine was very different I was like I need some bells. I need those for whatever reason it's, it's very grounding for me. It was very, and I think that is that emotion? No, been feeling grounded, and peaceful. 

01:58:45
UNKNOWN This is your experience really? 

01:58:45
SHANE BLASKO Yeah. 

01:58:50
UNKNOWN Well, it is, I'm going with it. Umm… And I think I'm not used to feel in that way and so there was a moment I'll call it sensation to go down that road and be like this is wrong, now maybe it's just an emotion that I haven't allowed myself to feel and to partake and that's okay. I like it. So it's fine. 

01:59:20
UNKNOWN I think the more, the more you do it or the more I do it because for me I think it's a little bit of fear too. Because it's kind of like if I'm gone for a second what did I miss out on or what could I've been thinking about or what could I've been preparing for so that fear of really just letting yourself kind of stay calm and so this time I'm like I'm going to do I'm going to try it and it was really helpful. 

01:59:45
UNKNOWN I will say this I can see how from moment to moment that particular exercise be extremely different because I'm in the moment where I am agitated then to be able to hone in on that and say, you're agitated right now right, you're frustrated, or you're irritated like to be able to hone in on that in that moment. I can see how that's different as opposed to right now in this moment I'm calm, I'm okay. I can only feel anything but I can, I can see how from, from moment to moment though how that can change and how be very much needed to be able to attend to whatever abortion is happening or to say I'm sad right now or to say I'm hurt by what you just said or by which you just did or I'm happy I'm actually happy like I'm, I'm okay with this what happen or whatever the case may be and so. 

02:00:40
UNKNOWN I'm realizing how hard it is to get to that point where it's just like you know that you're feeling it and to be, to be okay with that is the problem for me, like to be okay that this is happening right now seems to be the issue because as you were just saying moment to moment you may be frustrated in a moment and you're realizing that you're frustrated for me I'm realizing I'm frustrated this is going to make me more frustrated or more agitated. So being okay with knowing that I'm frustrated and agitated is a problem. I feel like that's not okay to do or to just be. 

02:01:25
UNKNOWN Because naturally we want to fix that… 

02:01:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:01:25
UNKNOWN If I see that I'm agitated I'm want to try to find a way to not be agitate anymore but sometimes just being able to recognize on agitated is the way for me just not being agitated because sometimes you can't fix something if you can't even recognize that's what it is. I know for me sometimes I feel something I was not only today like I can't even pinpoint it sometimes like I, I feel that I'm activists in certain way but I can't (inaudible ) like I'm not really talking today I'm doing this I'm short of people and cut people off so if I can hone in on that as (inaudible ) feeling like antisocial there if you like doing with people, okay that's what's wrong me or oh it's because somebody said up to me I don't like (inaudible ) felons. Oh so really it's this and then from their side, oh, well I don't know what's wrong with me now I can now I can tell the next person I'm just I have the best day today so, you know, I'm sorry if I come off a little whatever… 

02:02:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:02:20
UNKNOWN …now I can work on it. So sometimes being able to recognize that emotion can help you deal with the emotion, it's kind of, it's kind of the way to solve it sometimes. 

02:02:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, it make sense. 

02:02:35
ALLISON SPARGO And to if you have those critical thoughts of I shouldn't be feeling frustrated or it's not okay that I'm feeling frustrated that's you holding on to the emotion moving it from moment to moment rather than what just can be describing is there goes frustration, right? 

02:02:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:02:55
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

02:02:55
UNKNOWN So being a, being okay with let it go. 

02:03:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. I'm with you because that's my I think as I better not go on the other session. Being okay with whatever it is it's very difficult for me. Because I had naturally think of things very black on my (inaudible ). (inaudible )I'm happy, I'm sad this is fabulous, I hate it. So and I'm okay with bad but this gray area let me think about it. So I've been learning how to I think it's more of giving myself permission to be okay with whatever it is. 

02:03:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:03:45
UNKNOWN But then still for me is if it's not okay but I make myself feel like it's okay, and what this is really not okay, is what I'm, what I'm that feel naïve. 

02:03:55
UNKNOWN Because then you feel like you're lying to yourself to make yourself look better… 

02:04:00
UNKNOWN You know that's not okay but that's how a lot that's so… 

02:04:00
ALLISON SPARGO I'm going to create a mock tickertape. I'm frustrated I'm frustrated that I'm frustrated I'm frustrated that I'm frustrated that I'm frustrated right, but they're all transients until you grab one… 

02:04:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:04:10
ALLISON SPARGO …right, and think about it and process it. 

02:04:15
UNKNOWN And slammed on the ground and tap on it. 

02:04:20
UNKNOWN What, what am I doing that okay I got it it's here… 

02:04:20
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:04:20
UNKNOWN …like what I do with it now. 

02:04:25
Group leader confronts group member 

02:04:25
SHANE BLASKO You have to feel it to, you have to actually feel the frustration because if you don't feel the frustration you're just carrying around with you you're shoving your pocket, you just stick your other pocket you're putting it in your backpack, you're running around with you all day, all week, all month, all year… 

02:04:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:04:40
SHANE BLASKO …you've not you think you've buried it but you haven't used you, you still got it with you all the time until you actually experience the frustration. 

02:04:50
UNKNOWN Oh… 

02:04:50
SHANE BLASKO Once you experience the frustration then it can go away… 

02:05:00
UNKNOWN Is there another point… 

02:05:00
SHANE BLASKO Yeah. 

02:05:00
UNKNOWN You want to experience the negative. 

02:05:00
UNKNOWN No. 

02:05:05
SHANE BLASKO And say it's of course you don't want to experience is unpleasant feelings that's why let's say we talk about why we're avoiding it that's why where, you know, that's why we're, we're working too much, that's why we're planning, that's why we're avoiding, why we're doing all those things we're doing, that's why…. 

02:05:20
UNKNOWN Why working… 

02:05:20
SHANE BLASKO Exactly, that's why we're an unserious why we're doing all of those things exactly. But if we can and we don't have to be happy about the fact that we're having this emotion right, and maybe it's not even being okay with that I'm having this emotion, maybe it's just I'm having this emotion, just acknowledging that it happening. I am frustrated. 

02:05:55
ALLISON SPARGO I think that's an important difference you don't have to be happy about what it is but can you acknowledge it. 

02:06:05
SHANE BLASKO Because there are horrible things that happen to us all the time. We're not telling you we're not normally asking you to be happy about those things. But they have happened they're happening you're experiencing them you're going to have reactions to them. Have your reactions, have your emotional reaction. Experience that. 

02:06:35
UNKNOWN It was that as one of trying to do during the last exercise we did umm… is in the past you know I was frustrated that the others didn't work so well for me. So you started this one a try to go a little different stance of sitting or whatever, umm… and then I was just paying more attention to not necessarily my like breathing but it started my breathing and I was like with my emotions I was like okay like this is getting frustrating, it's not working I'm like afraid of like why is it not working so I like some fear and then anxiety of like well the several work and stuff like that. So I just acknowledge those during the exercise and then umm… I paid attention to what was happening with my body so like where do you feel in your body and it was like my feet, I felt like very sweaty inside of my shoes, and I was like moving my toes around and stuff like that so it was very interesting experience for me of when I'm frustrated anxious whatever, what is happening to my body and so I get sweaty and hot uncomfortable and sort of pairing those together that's not really been paired together before I guess. 

02:07:55
SHANE BLASKO To… to you have a sense of this exercise being successful for you? 

02:08:00
UNKNOWN I think it was yeah, and I was happy about that. Because I think it scared me the most like the emotions when I was like I don't want to get into that like there are so many of them and they freak out so I avoid them so I was just like okay and I went in probably with that like fear and anxiety and I think because I did it was able to help me more because I was able to acknowledge that and recognize it like this is what it is like when you get afraid of your emotions like that's fear which is an emotion and so when you feel fearful if you (inaudible ) like so, yeah. 

02:08:40
[sil.] 

02:08:45
UNKNOWN I'm still not convinced. 

02:08:50
ALLISON SPARGO Well, and so I have to bring back up that this is a process right, so last time you were… 

02:08:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:08:55
ALLISON SPARGO Mindfulness. 

02:08:55
JEREMY I was and I guess that's why this feel so like not what it should be or I guess I would talk about really what I would expecting for it to be because it wasn't what I experienced last time. Umm… And being okay with unpleasant as the emotion that I was feeling, yeah. 

02:09:15
ALLISON SPARGO And I think to going back I think maybe (inaudible ) said it that if, if we didn't put the expectations from one moment on to another moment then maybe the disappointment when we been there, right. 

02:09:30
JEREMY Right. 

02:09:30
ALLISON SPARGO And also I have to think that what, what the fear was and I think several of United was I might be overwhelmed by emotions if I stop and let them and let them and just at present right. No body was overwhelmed by them and in fact some of you are saying, where are they, right. 

02:09:50
JEREMY And I, and I did say that I was nervous about doing it because I thought there was going to be this overwhelming amount of emotion and there was nothing. 

02:10:05
ALLISON SPARGO Does that make you think that you're, does it make you think something deeper or more meaningful? The way you said there was nothing. 

02:10:15
JEREMY I guess I was just expecting the overwhelming. 

02:10:20
ALLISON SPARGO Okay. 

02:10:20
JEREMY I just thought that that's what it was going to be and I mean I don't necessarily know what that means deeper but it was just wasn't what I expected. And that is unpleasant. 

02:10:40
ALLISON SPARGO And it sounds to me like you're acknowledging it that you're not happy about it but you accept it as it is, right now in this… 

02:10:45
JEREMY I think I'm more so like trying to convince myself. 

02:10:50
UNKNOWN But I guess Jeremy so that if you have done this before you get the one before, what would you do? Like if they were switched because like for me it was, you know, (inaudible ) okay nothing but this one is like oh… 

02:11:01
JEREMY I guess my expectations would have been different though for the whole thoughts thing. I probably would have come into it with that expectations actually if we did this one before we did the thoughts, umm… I'm not sure how that would have changed, the End story now because if I went to with bad expectations and then nothing happened why is that I guess I would have been more okay with that because when I have been expecting for something and so… 

02:11:40
SHANE BLASKO This is a heady conversation. So, are you feeling the disappointment right now in this present moment? 

02:11:50
Group leader uses immediacy 

02:11:55
JEREMY No. And you and you just asked me that question, no, it wasn't like a disappointment. It was kind of like a maybe we're getting somewhere with what I'm supposed to be feeling and so… 

02:12:05
SHANE BLASKO But there is no supposed to be with feelings that's why I was asking because you I'm, because I'm actually got a little confused where is the disappointment something you felt during the exercise or after the exercise, during the processing? 

02:12:20
JEREMY During and right after when we discussed, you know, what we initially felt is where the disappointment was that I didn't feel like anything was expecting to so I was disappointed that I didn't, and then… 

02:12:30
SHANE BLASKO Except that part of what you felt during was disappointment? 

02:12:35
JEREMY Right. Yeah. 

02:12:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:12:40
UNKNOWN So in that moment then (inaudible ) moment during your feelings went somewhere else… 

02:12:45
JEREMY Right. 

02:12:45
UNKNOWN …it makes (inaudible ), okay, I'll see that. 

02:12:55
ALLISON SPARGO Just another, another to tie in one more piece is that maybe you're not carrying your emotions around those of you who didn't have the overwhelming this that you thought maybe if I if I can change the metaphor from swirling thoughts to swirling emotions, you've been they're not swirling because if you experience them in the moments and you let them go maybe you're letting them go. So you're hanging on to the emotions because of something you're doing rather then being mindful of experience rather it go, experience rather it go. Or experience it and it went away right. So even though it might be disappointing to not experience the overwhelmed emotion or even, you know, any real tangible emotion might actually do healthy maybe. 

02:13:45
UNKNOWN I think to me forget that being calm is a mood right do we forget that for… 

02:13:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:13:50
UNKNOWN …I will say that I will say at one point I was disappointed. I was like okay I'm not feeling anything then I really have (inaudible ) relaxed, you're calm, that's your emotion like that's okay, your calm, you're just chilling, and I think we forget that sometimes right even when we were emotional, don't be emotions we think of our sad, and angry and you know you think of, you know this little boisterous emotion and we forget that calm and relaxed are indeed emotions and so you felt something… 

02:14:20
JEREMY Yeah. 

02:14:20
UNKNOWN …just a different emotions than what you expected. 

02:14:25
JEREMY Right. 

02:14:25
UNKNOWN But you felt an emotion… 

02:14:25
JEREMY Yeah. 

02:14:25
UNKNOWN …right technically we all felt something will may not affect (inaudible ) we want to feel but we felt something. 

02:14:35
JEREMY And I think that's where the disappointment came in was that expectation but now in this moments I'm okay with what I experienced then because we did experience something just not what we expected. 

02:15:00
SHANE BLASKO And disappointment with an… an exercise is a valid experience and not wanting to ever do this experience again is a valid experience of it and hopefully you'll try it again anyway umm… but, you know, we have we have different responses and reactions just like I was saying she was like that other activity that that one just didn't know and did not resonate with her as she just she really, you know, had trouble with her and I'm also just want to, to recognize that as we're doing these activities we're doing, they're very short umm… when I practice these the emotion, meditation I may do it for 30 or 45 minutes. So I may have several different emotions that can come up in that or just the same one may kind of resonate during it and, and sometimes you may want to say, oh, you know what I'm having this emotion maybe I need put to, to this meditation because I'm noticing I may be acting a certain way today and maybe I need to take a timeout and go spend, you know, ten minutes, fifteen minutes and then go sort of deal with this if I can, you know, take the time out that day. So just sort of recognize that we have been doing short activities so that umm… if you want to practice some of these longer time spans you may have a different experience with them. 

02:16:50
ALLISON SPARGO So one more meeting left do you have any homework assignments for yourselves or any I hate to say future calls any, any places in the process that you want to spend time as we move into our last session? 

02:17:10
UNKNOWN I like to continue with the progress I think I maintain session… 

02:17:15
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

02:17:15
UNKNOWN …not just with exercise but with being more open and sharing more so… 

02:17:20
ALLISON SPARGO Okay. 

02:17:20
UNKNOWN It's my goal. 

02:17:20
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

02:17:25
JEREMY I'm going to definitely work on the okay factor being okay with being okay that needs work so, I'm going to focus on that. I'm going to try this exercise particularly again and I think I'm going to be conscious of trying gates when I'm feeling different emotions just to see how the end result turns out. 

02:17:50
[sil.] 

02:17:55
UNKNOWN I'm going to try to work on that having that (inaudible ) specific expectations. It's okay to have like a general expectation like all this maybe good, or this may be interesting but then I have like okay I think this is exactly what's going to happen when I do this activity like trying to like (inaudible ) expectations. 

02:18:15
JEREMY You know, that's my … 

02:18:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:18:20
UNKNOWN With in the moment for me (inaudible ). 

02:18:30
[sil.] 

02:18:40
ALLISON SPARGO Okay. So let's rap this session up and we'll meet for our last final session, we'll talk about the wandering mind. We'll review some of the goals that you came in with, some of the group goals and then also just kind of process, you know, we've been processing a lot, the process the total experience in addition to the topic, the session topic as well, okay. Right, see you again next time, okay, thank you. 

02:19:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:19:10

02:19:10
The Final Session- 

02:19:10
Pulling It All Together 

02:19:15
Allison Spargo: Hi everybody. 

02:19:15
JEREMY Hi. 

02:19:20
ALLISON SPARGO It's our last group tonight. So just like most other sessions talk to me about what material you will to my previous times together to revisit or review? 

02:19:35
Re-introduction and review of homework 

02:19:35
JEREMY (inaudible ) I was going to work on practicing, mindfulness of emotion, and I'll just come to the conclusion that whatever I'm feeling at that time or I go into the practice of it is the emotion that I'm going to feel that I'm going to become aware of umm… so my mindfulness of emotion is very dependent on that present moment. 

02:20:00
[music] 

02:20:10
UNKNOWN And I don't know there's like problem but one thing that I did notice that when I practice mindfulness of emotion and I know I have to experience the emotion, I'm comfortable with how long it takes me to experience it, and sometimes in the moment, you know, you experience it but you still it's during your day so you have to keep going and so I'm like I kind of a shut it off but then I feel like I'm just caring it around anyway, so that I'm frustrated like why should we need practicing mindfulness of emotions. So, I don't know. 

02:20:45
ALLISON SPARGO It sounds like you solve a lot of rules around… 

02:20:45
UNKNOWN Like I'm okay. 

02:20:50
Normalizing uncomfortable experiences. 

02:20:50
ALLISON SPARGO And I think in some ways that's, that's accurate because there are places where emotions are more readily accepted right. So if you're in a delivery room, you know have some emotions and they're going to be welcomed the funeral right. Certain emotions are welcome to direct funeral, not all emotions right, so happiness and maybe joyfulness right, I'll be welcomed at all funerals. And so we internalize that a little bit right. We start to make these rules the social rules internal to ourselves and that can get us hung up sometimes. 

02:21:25
TISH I'm still working on whole expectations thing but I'm working on it, right. I still I think that, that's always kind of the my safety (inaudible ) I was always read expectations about stuff. So umm… trying to scale that back form had generalize expectations, is trying to scale it back. And so (inaudible ). 

02:21:50
Probing the status quo 

02:21:50
ALLISON SPARGO And what happens when you find yourself having one of those specific expectations? 

02:21:55
[sil.] 

02:22:00
TISH Umm… I'm more aware of it now I will say that before I wasn't something that I paid any attention to the best is what I did. Reason now I know that you're doing it again, right. You have this great… or specific expectation of something and so now more mindful of it. 

02:22:15
[sil.] 

02:22:20
ALLISON SPARGO Anything else to review or read as it. 

02:22:25
UNKNOWN I think I'm more aware now when I self add it and so will back things, reject things and reject things and stuff like that. 

02:22:35
Encouraging 

02:22:35
Visual representation of mindfulness of being for adolescent group 

02:22:35
ALLISON SPARGO So you're still doing it but you're aware that you're doing sometimes even maybe accepting not being happy with but accepting. Also, that's (inaudible ). 

02:22:45
[sil.] 

02:22:50
ALLISON SPARGO And so this is a process right, with years of practice you might be able to fully integrate a mindfulness of body, mindfulness of thoughts, a mindfulness of emotion and attend to the man the wandering mind. That, you know, these groups would each only attended it one thing at a time and it was so challenge sometimes. So, you know, practice can I give you a visual with me pat (inaudible ), rub, and kick, and tap. 

02:23:30
UNKNOWN Tap what? 

02:23:30
ALLISON SPARGO The other one and tap the other right. And I know it seems silly can you, can you cognitively think about can you attend to all of these different tasks as you're doing them? Can you even do them all? 

02:23:45
JEREMY It's, I'm, I'm struggling I think. 

02:23:50
ALLISON SPARGO And you don't stop but it's hard… 

02:23:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

02:23:55
ALLISON SPARGO …right… 

02:23:55
JEREMY Yeah. 

02:24:00
Introduction to psychoeducation - The Wandering Mind 

02:24:00
ALLISON SPARGO We did it for a short time and so again this is just a kind of a visual like this circle like I just a visual illustration of what I'm asking you to do four different things and then attend to all four different things. You're not going to be able to attend fully to one without maybe letting go of the other right, so I stopped tapping my foot that was the first thing to go and then this footstep kicking but I was always patting my head. So we're going to practice. It's going to be a hard thing to do today and in the future if you decide to move all of this into your more regular route, it's going to be judge but with more practice short bursts maybe free (inaudible ) with a minute, or two minutes or three minutes for all of us really short bursts, you know, maybe experience growth of concentration right. So let me talk to you about the wandering mind, you never heard that term before? You haven't even heard mindfulness right. Okay, so it's, it's similar to what it just sounds like your mind will wander, right. So when we did our mindfulness of thoughts, the thoughts came in right and sometimes we not only did thoughts come in but your mind might have gone outside of the room. Your mind went to the future, your mind went to the past all these things were happening to your mind. So the wondering mind reminds us in some ways that were alive right. We can also be reminded that we're alive by staying in the present and generally returning to our breath is our anchor right. And the reason it's called the wandering mind is it will continue to wander but minds do. You can you can practice and practice and it will be I don't want to say impossible but it incredibly challenging to ever fully live moment to moment, fully present in each moment. You're really challenging endeavor. So the wandering mind is another meditation of integrating all of these things but also being where… where your mind goes to and encouraging yourself to maintain some level of concentration. To do all four things at one time so pat and rub and kick and tap, all are one time if you can. And if you can't if you lose focus of one, breathe and see where you go. And if you wander you breathe and you see where you go because it's a cycle and this is the way that humans are, are biologically made up this is the way that our brains are wired. But we also know that our brains can be rewired so just because we learned something once does that mean that it's forever and ever and we can learn something different and replace right. 

02:26:45
[sil.] 

02:26:50
ALLISON SPARGO So (inaudible ), Jeremy so nervous and it's a process… 

02:26:55
JEREMY Yeah. 

02:26:55
ALLISON SPARGO …it's a process so what you experience from mindfulness of might not be here but we're hoping that maybe if we have less expectation or if we let go of the future or we let go of the past and just be present that maybe we can accept. Mrs. (inaudible ) be happy but accept what it is that we're experiencing. And if we're disappointed we're disappointed and if we're content, we're content. 

02:27:20
JEREMY Okay. 

02:27:25
Reminding group of goals of mindfulness' 

02:27:25
ALLISON SPARGO Okay. And there's no pressure to this, there is no right way and that's been something that's been kind of at the end that you guys are mentioned. There is no right way to do this. These are guided meditations that Dr. Blasko and I are, are helping you to get the basics but you're going to make them your own. So your own mind will maybe you'll do these unguided some day and you will naturally return to your breath. There are lots of different options available for the guided meditations. This is just one option it's not the right option. Think which again and leave the respond, okay. Okay. So in this one we're going to start… 

02:28:05
SHANE BLASKO Bells. 

02:28:05
ALLISON SPARGO …with the bells. 

02:28:05
SHANE BLASKO And uh… Dr. Spargo is going to lead you and you're just going to follow your mind as your mind wanders. And you will do your best not to judge yourself, okay. 

02:28:25
ALLISON SPARGO When you judge yourself? 

02:28:25
SHANE BLASKO You'll notice that you are. 

02:28:30

Group leader provides insight and uses immediacy

ALLISON SPARGO Sometimes relaxation is a by product of mindfulness. This group feels different again, isn't it? It's not what, what we're doing is not relaxation, what we're doing is mindfulness. And sometimes people feel frustration and disappointmentaly talk about that. Sometimes you might feel relaxation too. That's a sense of getting something from that group then all of the sudden comeing back from that one is your sense of sometime.

02:34:45
JEREMY Umm… There is (inaudible ) like I have drifting off to sleep feeling again but not actually being sleep. And I don't know none of us say that if you had stopped talking at some point because it seemed like this long period of silence, so yeah that was another good experience I guess. And I went into it without the whole expectation thing like was suggested and I was able to focus on my breathing. 

02:35:25
[sil.] 

02:35:30
UNKNOWN I didn't have an expectation either but its interesting because, you know, my thoughts are all of the place that one but I was okay with that.

UNKNOWN It was very pleasant. 

02:39:20
ALLISON SPARGO So when I was thinking where your wanders right so that was wondering mind so your mind wandered to about your coworkers swaying and in a really pleasant experience. 

02:39:35
UNKNOWN Yes, it's funny because it was like the ocean like form waves but like I guess in my brain like peaceful waves so it was like rocking right back and forth but it was still peaceful not but storming waves I guess.

Members connecting around natural cognitive states

UNKNOWN But your (inaudible ) because I think at some points like my imagination kind of just like got the best of me but it makes sense to my mom I wonder is this really my imaginations is like (inaudible ) I guess being on the child recreating my imagination. So that, that's scary, you know, that carry along with you thought as so my mind wanders I'm having is grandiose things happening in my mind and so I've been have a similar situation like of stuff showing (inaudible ) and imagination so. 

02:40:30
ALLISON SPARGO Did any else's mind wander? 

02:40:35
JEREMY When, when Herman mentioned the music I realize that because I know I'll say I was able to more, more so focus on my breathing but thinking about it now there were thoughts were there and I knew that they were there but it was just kind of like okay, and then I would just go back to my breathing. But yeah there were a couple of songs that roll through and that song was like those are my like those are my, my random thoughts were songs.

Members committing to using mindfulness techniques to create cognitive and behavioral change 

02:41:20
UNKNOWN I really didn't have any umm… I'm going to say I don't know I, I tried to make because really my mind always wanders if not even when I sleep like it's not a time when I wake up on tired because the whole night I have been thinking, you know, whatever so I guess at this moment I'm like okay, well let me see what I can do and it, it really didn't wonder off too much I guess I could say I guess because they were going so slow, but a kind of bell rang, they couldn't (inaudible ) I don't know, but I'm, I'm used to I've been always wander I don't this time I was like no, I'm not going to let it wander, no, instead of ever we have that problem. We did exercise so I'm going to continue to try to do the exercise especially when my mind gets to go on everywhere I'm going to try to just stop and do it, and see it like I'm kind of call myself right back there. 

02:42:20
ALLISON SPARGO And when you say stop and do it, what is do it? 

02:42:20
UNKNOWN Close my eyes. 

02:42:25
ALLISON SPARGO Same you dignified (inaudible ). 

02:42:27
UNKNOWN To me I'm going to associated with hands (inaudible ) close my eyes because I think you said before in a previous session like if my eyes are open , oh it's gone, umm… nothing I' not going to be particular about anything but everything else. So, you know, close my eyes and just try to take you know come and go with the slow because otherwise if I'm opened, my eyes are opened I'm not going to be able to focus so I think close my eyes are really is the my point. 

02:43:00
Group leader using self disclosure to encourage members 

02:43:00
ALLISON SPARGO Simply harder to so avoid the distraction… 

02:43:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

02:43:00
ALLISON SPARGO …with one more (inaudible ) available to them right. 

02:43:10
UNKNOWN So when you ask me like do it so again I guess it for this reason did activity but can you all see yourself just kind of like doing it without doing it like closing the eyes. 

02:43:20
JEREMY I, I don't I guess, I think… be dignified. 

02:43:30
UNKNOWN Your position, you know, I can see myself just kind of just like seeing here like okay let me get myself together. I would really have to like go with, because you're, because I would like… 

02:43:40
Tish processing how the new skills can integrate into her daily life 

02:43:40
TISH You know, I actually I can't see myself doing it without this because, you know, and I will say this is not necessarily like because (inaudible ) okay. But in those moments where I can't necessarily just sit down and do that, I can see myself trying to just bring awareness to whatever is happening in that moment. So I can see myself doing that like just trying to be aware like whatever emotion I'm feeling or what's happening with my body okay my chest is (inaudible ) and I obviously anxious about something or oh, you, your mind is wandering right now, you have all type of (inaudible ) on your head right now. What, what that you thinking, I had to see myself trying to tend to that more but yes, there are still (inaudible ) have to sit down.

Reiterating the strength of group process 

02:44:30
Planning for the future, exploring stumbling blocks 

02:44:30
ALLISON SPARGO I feel like today we might have gotten in touch with a little bit more on our brains, and our hearts, and our hobbies, also thoughts maybe. And again these were just short exercises we've only been together four sessions and you have a lot more potential should you choose to explore your mindfulness. When you're when your mind wandered, it had all sorts of options to go to. And the two that shared were not unpleasant, right. When we explored our mindfulness of thoughts activity, it wasn't unpleasant. In our mindfulness of emotions activity, it wasn't as expected right. And our bodily sensations both in the first session and here it's different right. So as we draw all of these group sessions to close and now we've talked a lot about, you know, at each point what can we take with us and Mary mention that she would like to take this, this chair and kind of with you. We can talk about the things that we want to take with us and we can also I hate to say fortune tell but you know maybe, maybe prepare for some things that might be (inaudible ). A lot of people have struggle with finding time for this. If you're doing this in this group it might feel different to do it at home, or at school. In this group everybody understands what you're doing but the goal is or the intention, if you do it at home or at school people might be liking what's you're doing, right. So they're also active things and I don't I don't want to spend a lot of time in the future but if we spend some time exploring the future then we can maybe encourage more opportunities for mindfulness throughout our lives. So can you help me understand what may be some stumbling blocks and how we can work through them? 

02:46:40
JEREMY Still at home being okay with being okay thing. That's I think always going to be a challenge because umm.., as you mentioned before that's not really allowed in our society… 

02:46:55
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

02:47:00
JEREMY …so it makes it really hard so just be reckless. Because that's I mean that's how society has made me view that as being reckless. So and not being judgmental as well. 

02:47:15
[sil.] 

02:47:20
TISH I think we (inaudible ) to although we planned for future learning how to live, and future umm.. specially at this age, you're at a age where there's so much you're trying to plan for you're trying to figure out what you're going to do with the rest of your lives so literally everything is rooted in future, everything I do right now it's going to effect where happens to me 10 years for now it was just like that is so scary, and so think that just oh I just take a wonder and it's over (inaudible ) no, I give it what you're going to do, I've already (inaudible ) and so learning how to be a okay with now at a time in life where everything is so rooted in later is very scary. And like you said it's okay to prepare and think about that but learning how to now literally just live in that featuring completely miss out on everything happening now. That's, that's the hard part learning the balance I guess. 

02:48:30
Group leader paraphrasing group members' reactions 

02:48:30
ALLISON SPARGO So reminding yourself that you got a choice to visit the future, and to prepare for the future and her goals for the future but also come back and live in this moment. And working towards being this judgment, we're not judgment. 

02:48:50
Group leader encourages members to embrace the feelings being expressed 

02:48:50
SHANE BLASKO And Maybe even by giving yourself some space to feel that's scared what you're talking about. 

02:49:00
[sil.] 

02:49:05
TISH Literally I mean just I mean little things like when you're at school you're always thinking about graduation, graduation, graduation, like you can't even start the first day of class (inaudible ) what I thinking oh I cannot wait to grow. And like which you and you miss out on every, every step of getting to graduation. The test that you pass, the test that you're going to fail like and being okay, will being okay like okay I didn't pass this test as opposed to, oh my God I'm never gonna graduate but I felt this one test like this everything seems so rooted in there. So it's just learning how to be, be okay with (inaudible ), everything… 

02:49:40
[sil.] 

02:49:45
May explaining how this group has given her permission to acknowledge and accept her present moment 

02:49:45
TISH That so true, of course now that you said that of course I have to self disclose again umm… and lot of my, my elementary days when I was umm… of course, you know, when they diagnose with ADHD I also, I'm also this lazy. So even now in class being older I always go back to that like (inaudible ). But I always go back to the am I going to stumble what is tough for me to read, you know, am I going to pass this class, am I going to think a piece (inaudible ) when I'm doing my multiple choice. So I was like I'm really have to like this is really show me like (inaudible ) no it's okay like, it's okay, it's okay I don't pass every test. It's okay if I don't, you know, get A in this class because of my parents which we don't go back to because of my parents I know that I have to live in this moment and it's okay, you know so this is really like opened up for me to say okay (inaudible ) you really going to just live in the moment and you're going to be okay. It's okay. Don't be nervous, go to class. Hey, if you read you stumble, it's okay because somebody else stumbles who's not this lazy but they're going to stumble to. But of course I am a critic to myself because when I stumble I'm just hello, everybody look at me and they laugh at, you know, like (inaudible ) but for me is like (inaudible ), you know… 

02:51:05
JEREMY Yeah. 

02:51:10
TISH …and so I guess for me it's really like live now, live for the moment and don't worry about what if, what cannot do, what happened that they cal me on a class, just a little bit (inaudible ). I'm really I'm living in the moment now that's some one (inaudible ). 

02:51:25
JEREMY Thus it suppresses thus it keep (inaudible ) process, it's a process. And that helps you being okay with being okay because remind yourself that it's a process but you know that right now you don't have to (inaudible ). You eventually maybe not eventually get to that point but during this time living in the moment it's okay. 

02:51:45
Empowerment as a result of resetting cognitions through mindfulness 

02:51:45
UNKNOWN And it just takes for me it just takes the pressure off and it just I don't say it's great it was just funny to me how I'm the beginning I saw the future as a place of comfort but really doing these exercise how being in the moment is a place of safety like it's okay it takes a lot of pressure off myself because I battle with anxiety really, really, really badly. And a lot of the things that we, you know, the activities that we done has helped me so very much because that's all really anxiety is I'm thinking about what's coming I'm thinking about what was in my thoughts just run away with me, and in a moment the breathing part the breath is your anchor is huge for me. Because when I'm sitting here I'm like that's my reset button no matter what is happening I can reset and in this moment it is okay. 

02:52:45
JEREMY And the anxiety is eliminated, yeah. 

02:52:45
UNKNOWN And it is done. 

02:52:50
JEREMY Wow. 

02:52:50
UNKNOWN So… 

02:52:50
ALLISON SPARGO That is so empowering. 

02:52:55
JEREMY It really, it really… 

02:53:00
ALLISON SPARGO And that we're all at different stages in this group right. So if you're not experiencing the liberation and the relief or you know, all of this that Stacy, Nicole just shared okay right, because it's okay to be where we are and I, I hope that that's something that you guys are all taking with you is even when you do encounter something that your breath is your anchor, and that you have the choice to draw back to that anchor. And just to come back to what could be a place of safety or what could be a place of unpleasantness but to experience it fully to be alive in each moment. 

02:53:40
JEREMY Because it's (inaudible ). 

02:53:45
[sil.] 

02:53:50
Exploring future goals and how to use mindfulness CBT to work towards them 

02:53:50
UNKNOWN I felt like I'm not where I want to be here but at least recognize the potential to be where I want to be and that's okay that at least I have some more awareness about it where are you in this process. 

02:54:10
[sil.] 

02:54:15
JEREMY Hence like process (inaudible ) my goal (inaudible ) everything. 

02:54:20
Termination of final group session 

02:54:20
ALLISON SPARGO I think you are going to (inaudible ). Well if this feels like a comfortable space for us to end our time together, I'd like us to end with the bells. Does that, does that feel okay for you guys too? Okay. 

02:54:40
[sil.] 

02:54:45
[music] 

02:55:00
UNKNOWN We just finished two more sessions in mindfulness based CBT group counseling with adolescents. Allison and Shane welcome back. So I like hear your thoughts about we saw in the last two sessions there was definitely a shift in the group dynamic. 

02:55:15
SHANE BLASKO Yes, so in this third session what we did see um, was one of our group members really struggle trying to get back to that place where he had gotten really excited where he had gone to a place where he had experienced that absence of thought, and then he will he gotten very excited about it and then and he had a real high and then in that third session when we went through that… that we went to be the emotion base meditation where our group members were trying to sit with uncomfortable emotions really struggled because he was trying so hard to get back to that place and he couldn't get back there. And so here ends up having a pretty negative experience trying to get back to that place. And it was (inaudible ) his group members processed with him to trying and try and help him, and he was able to get to a slightly higher place with that. 

02:56:15
ALLISON SPARGO And I think along those same lines you alluded to the fact that, that this group started to take over for themselves. 

02:56:20
SHANE BLASKO Yes. 

02:56:20
ALLISON SPARGO So in the first two sessions they were relying more on us and in this third session there was quite a shift actually in that they were eager for the material and I think in part due to the elevation that comes when you're when you're relieved of trying to alter your thoughts or trying to control your emotions and I think they saw that it was really going to benefit them if they could practice it, if they could really get a handle on this material, and so they started to, to ask for more and to push each other and who are engaged one another. And it was quite a treat for, for me to see that the group members really said it's take ownership of not only the material but also of the process and how they were engaging with it. 

02:56:55
UNKNOWN Okay so it seemed like they really uh, have formed good effective working relationship and started to take ownership of the concept of mindfulness and use that to encourage each other and support each other. 

02:57:05
ALLISON SPARGO And I think too we had some group members start to engage more in the third session and others you might see it start to withdraw a little bit, yes. 

02:57:15
UNKNOWN And is that typical? 

02:57:15
ALLISON SPARGO Well, I don't know if it would be, you know, all groups are unique so I wouldn't describe it as a as a typical. I think that there is always a level of hope that all group members will participate together and there's always an expectation that maybe not everybody will participate along the lines of the group cohesion that we would be hopeful for it. But I think that umm… you know there are different levels of engagement would be typical for any, any group for sure any group. 

02:57:45
UNKNOWN And did you have a sense of what might of caused the change for that for the group that started to withdraw that? 

02:57:50
SHANE BLASKO At the time was not aware of what was going on, after the fact we did become aware. So after the final group session was over one that the group member that had started withdrawing, did let us know that they were stuck they had they had were experiencing some significant personal emotional problems and that that was their cause for withdrawing and they chose not to share that with the group but it also caused them to withdraw from the group. 

02:58:20
UNKNOWN So although the focus of the group was staying in the present moment and really focusing on mindfulness something that was occurring outside of the group impacted the group members experience. 

02:58:30
ALLISON SPARGO And I think that that's, that's something that anyone who dabbles in mindfulness and mindfulness based C.B.T is going to encounter is withdrawn to the past. And withdrawn to the future and when trying to problem solve or trying to take care of things, we're trying to avoid trouble. So all those things that we talked about in those particular sessions were things that they were experiencing in the moment. So even if you are drawn to the past and it's so uncomfortable to be in the here and now moment where it's just too vulnerable of a space for them that, you know, sometimes we're just going to let our mind go to the future, over going to let our mind go to the past or we're just going to kind of, kind of check out. And that's something that can be expected to especially with an adolescent group. It's really hard to stay focused on something that's new and something that's uncomfortable and something that is in a quiet and something that doesn't have a lot of as social aspects to it until the processing occurs. So I think that that is something that, you know, it was it was unexpected, unexpected all at the same time. 

02:59:25
UNKNOWN Sure. And it does seem like one of the primary challenges of mindfulness particularly if you're going through a particularly stressful time in your life outside of the group is to clear those thoughts and to focus on being fully present in the moment. 

02:59:35
ALLISON SPARGO Or just accepting those thoughts in the present moment that they're that you're carrying them with you even if they're uncomfortable and yeah sure. 

02:59:45
SHANE BLASKO And that's not to say I mean the group the group member didn't say whether or not they were able to be successful in being present in the activities, the group member just explained to their reason for not sharing verbally in the processing. So it's unknown if they were just uncomfortable sharing what they experienced during the process because it may have been related to what they were experiencing during the activity. 

03:00:10
UNKNOWN Okay, great. 

03:00:10
ALLISON SPARGO And I think in the fourth session umm… some of the group members who started out more quietly maybe were more reserved because of that the ambiguity that was going on in the first and second session. You really got engaged in that fourth session and they were, you know, excited to make this material move into their everyday lives. Umm… So it was, it was need and exciting to watch them in particular the more quiet group members really get engaged and eager to take that information and make changes in their everyday life. 

03:00:40
UNKNOWN So do you feel like you've met your goal of providing education about the concept of mindfulness and helping group members integrate those concepts for themselves. 

03:00:45
ALLISON SPARGO Yes. 

03:00:45
SHANE BLASKO Absolutely. 

03:00:45
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

03:00:45
SHANE BLASKO Yeah. 

03:00:50
ALLISON SPARGO I think it was a little bit slower than hoped but definitely I think they got the information. 

03:00:55
UNKNOWN Great. And it seems like it might be a slow process a time because the developmental stage and just because the concept may be new to someone no matter what their developmental stage but when they get there it seems like it was really powerful. 

03:01:05
ALLISON SPARGO Yes, and what I loved about this group is we had a really diverse group of clients in this, in this setting and no matter what the background, no matter what the history was, they were able to take the concepts of mindfulness based CBT and create their own personal meaning and move it you know plan to move it forward into their utter lives and that's really need to see that it's a really cross cultural concept. 

03:01:30
UNKNOWN Right, right. So what tips would you have for someone who's thinking about running this type of group themselves? 

03:01:35
SHANE BLASKO Well I think one thing that's really important is that if you're going to be running this type of group yourself, the first thing is to make sure that you really know these scales well so that you have your own practice. And if you have your own practice then you would understand that it's important to have a lot of patience for yourself and a lot of self compassion umm… and we felt that umm… going forth and putting together a group like this umm… you're going to need to have a lot of patience for yourself, and then we felt that have a lot of fun with that. 

03:02:15
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

03:02:15
UNKNOWN Sure. So it does seem like something that could be a struggle but also a really enjoyable activity that people want to take outside of group and integrated into their daily life. 

03:02:25
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah, and like Shane was mentioning this is a process this is something that you're not going to start and finish in the same day. There's not like a 100% you're not going to ever check it off it's… 

03:02:35
UNKNOWN Sure. 

03:02:35
ALLISON SPARGO …it's an ongoing process. And sometimes a very uncomfortable one and so the patients peace is really important to recognize that umm… to just love yourself, to be aware of all of your experiences but to also try your best to accept them as they come, and like Shane said as you work towards becoming a facilitator of the styles of groups to really know your stuff, because if you haven't done it, it's going to be on a strange sensation of trying to ask or explore with your clients and process with them what their experience is like if you really aren't aware of what your own experience was like first. 

03:03:10
SHANE BLASKO Yeah. 

03:03:10
UNKNOWN Sure. And one thing I think was benefit about this particular demonstration is that we had the opportunity to have you both co-facilitate. Umm… Can you talk a little bit about the co-facilitation process and why that's so important? 

03:03:20
ALLISON SPARGO Sure I think for me umm… I have I'm a big proponent of co-facilitation. So I am, I am extremely grateful that she was able to work with us to get today as far as leading these particular groups. Umm… I think with any group there is there's a lot of dynamics and there were things that she was picking up on that I just, you know, got lost in that and that meaning making or in the conversation some heads were nodding and some, some scholars or some other facial, you know, nonverbals. And so if you've got one group leader attending to the content and another maybe attending to the process then there's less likely to be lost if you've got two people in the room, yeah. 

03:04:00
UNKNOWN Yeah I agree I think up from my own experience I found that tremendously beneficial just difficult to manage effectively with one person. As well as some of your processing like sort of behind the scenes what did you discuss after the group and what did you learn from this experience?

SHANE BLASKO Umm… More, a lot of our processing or we process a lot before the group, during the group, after the group which means sessions and then after the group we processed a lot, well how did you think this went, what do you think was going on for this member, for these members interaction, we, we, we must of over processed it. So ahead of time we were processing okay what it, you know, how are we going to try and explain these concepts to the members, umm… how, what, what activities do we think we want to use umm… as Allison mentioned before, you know, we, we, we came up with a lot of extra stuff way more than we knew we could possibly put into the group. So we had it we knew that we were not going to run out of stuff in case they didn't engage in the processing. We made sure that we had ways to help them process in different ways if they didn't engage in processing it one way then we can try and process it another way. So in an in between sessions it asked what it was how did you think this one and, you know, what do you think was going on with this particular client who seemed like they weren't engaging in us and how do you think we should try and pull this particular person out. Umm… So did you think this person was reacted to this, you know… 

03:05:35
UNKNOWN It's really attending to the group dynamics and interactions between members, okay, okay. 

03:05:40
SHANE BLASKO Yes 

03:05:40
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah, along the same lines just I think I did where I don't know if it's really reality testing but, you know, what I saw this happened what did you think or did you, did you notice this and if there was a yes like okay what, what kind of sense can we make of that so just kind of, kind of remember checking, double checking cross referencing the data if you will about how the group was going or how the interactions were flowing. 

03:06:05
UNKNOWN Thank you for that. What closing words do you have for someone who might be interested in facilitating this type of group? 

03:06:10
ALLISON SPARGO I think umm… for, for facilitating any type of group there are a couple key concepts to keep in mind what is the type of group that you're leading, who are the participants in your group and then also what are your major goals. So to kind of address those three topics and also be aware that groups are going to go through typical stages of development but also that the facilitator needs to be flexible enough to meet the group members where they are, to allow the group members the space to make meaning of the material that you are providing for them. And just have fun, have fun with the material as are some of my parting tips for anyone interested in facilitating any style of group and especially a mindfulness based CBT group with adolescents. 

03:06:50
UNKNOWN Yeah that seem really important so knowing just about groups in general like you said the stages, that, you know, typical roles of a group member maybe just basic group facilitation skills… 

03:06:55
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

03:07:00
UNKNOWN …and then also the specialized content knowledge of mindfulness in CBT… 

03:07:00
ALLISON SPARGO Right. 

03:07:05
UNKNOWN …coupled with the developmental stage of adolescence or whatever client I believe that you're working with. 

03:07:10
ALLISON SPARGO Exactly. 

03:07:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, and I think a lot of sense I think it's very helpful to think about it that way. Allison and Shane thank you again for sharing this information with us today. I think it was very informative and hopefully helpful to everyone who's thinking about running a Mindfulness based CBT group with adolescents or with any population. We hope you enjoyed this demonstration, thank you so much for watching.
