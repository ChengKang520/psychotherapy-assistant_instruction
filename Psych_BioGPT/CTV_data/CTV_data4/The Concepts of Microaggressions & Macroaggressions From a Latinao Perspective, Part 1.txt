The Concepts of Microaggressions & Macroaggressions from a Latina/o Perspective Part 1 

00:00:00
A Conversation with Maritza Gallardo-Cooper Patricia Arredondo David Acevedo Lisa Costas & Carlos Zalaquett 

00:00:00
The Concepts of Microaggressions & Macroaggressions from a Latina/o Perspective 

00:00:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Welcome. Our program today is about microaggressions and macroaggressions from a Latino perspective. What we would like to accomplish today is a review of this concept at a number of different levels. For example, at a personal interpersonal type of level and a academic and training type of level and, of course, a professional type of level. And then, moving from microaggressions into macroaggressions and talk about it from a [??] and organizational, uh, holistic systemic point of view. But I have the pleasure in order to accomplish our goal for today to be in the company of a distinguished group of colleagues.

00:02:15
Dr. Carlos Zalaquett 

00:02:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Hi, my name is Carlos Zalaquett, again. I'm an Associate Professor in the University of South Florida. In the (inaudible ) department within the College of Education. And as you can see I'm surrounded by a distinguished group of Latino faculty. Several of which has experience not only of, uh, Latino issues in the United States but also in other countries like, for example, Puerto Rico or Chile or Mexico. And, um, as part of our conversation we're gonna try to address some of the issues but also to offer some potential, uh, suggestions for solutions or ways to approach these issues. 

00:02:55
What do you think about the concept of Microaggression? 

00:02:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT But I would like to start with a very important question from my point of view. Which is, what do you all think about the concept of microaggression? 

00:03:00
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER I think it's a very, um, real issue that we all have experience but we did not know how to identify at the beginning, at least in my experience. It was that level of discomfort , of things not fitting in. And as I grew personally and professionally my professional development it became a much more real and a much more clear concept of an issue that I had to deal with. Not only within myself but also with the people that I supervise and with my clients. 

00:03:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO You know, it's interesting how you can, um, begin to give a label, um, to an experience you have. And how helpful that is. Uh, actually the term itself I came upon when I was doing consulting back in the 90's and coming out of communications literature. And, uh, we were looking at issues in the work place and how people would feel in a interpersonally affronted by what someone else did. And the communications literature calls this microaggression. And so that made sense to a lot of people who were in our workshops and seminars. They said they understood what also, when that person, uh, talks to me in that way and doesn't call me by, you know, Miss or, you know, and calls everybody, calls me by my first name and calls everybody else, you know, addresses with more formality. Now I know why that bothers me so it, it became, that's how I got introduced to it but clearly see how it fits into our work as, uh, counselors and psychologists. 

00:04:40
Concept provides a helpful way to understand personal experience and facilitates its process 

00:04:45
LISA COSTAS I think one of the things that, um, microaggression addresses is disloyalties(ph) that many of us experience, our clients experience, our students experience. And they haven't been able to label or they feel very confused this what really helps put it into context, understand it better. But it also explains how many things that were overt have... are now more subtle. And, uh, it helps us take a look at that and being able to apply some solution. 

00:05:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh, it's interesting how by listening to you it, it becomes clear to me that it sort of like a now finding a way to identify something that before we couldn't really process well because we didn't know... may of been a concern even though it produces discomfort. But the other thing that, that caused my, uh, attention to it is the fact that friends and foes, meaning this is not something that people who are, uh, in a negative position towards you. This, this might be the type of thing that even your, your friends would say sometimes in talking about your relatives or in talking about your (inaudible ). 

00:05:52
Impact of Microaggressions at a Personal and Interpersonal Level. 

00:05:52
CARLOS ZALAQUETT How has microaggressions affected or impacted your personal, interpersonal experiences? 

00:06:00
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER Well Carlos, I can only see it from a personal perspective, also as a professional. You know, I, I, uh, we were talking specifically this was kind of a vague issue, a very personal experience we all had. It was so wonderful it's like Hayley(ph) used to say, like, 90 percent of solving a problem is identifying it and then we can come up with a solution. And for me that's the way this... it was a process for me until finally I went, aha, now this all makes sense and I had an action for it. I think that going with what you're saying specifically, how did that affected me, I think it has affected me a lot personally as I'm growing in a new culture as a person but also make me a better clinician. Because I have a better understanding of the subtleties of, and I, I could address that specifically in therapy. Because otherwise I would never have asked about that so, in that perspective it has made me a better clinician. So, it's, it's a, it's a process that has been parallel in my life at least, growing little by little at a time when, you know, multi-cultural, multi-cultural movement was not really a much more known concept per se as to where we are right now. And even though we've made so much progress the issues are still there. I've, I, I've got many expressions of, like I've got it from my mother, I've got my, my own personal life and I also had it with colleagues. For example, I've had a, a interesting experience of a colleague who wanted me to, um, see their, um, their niece who was a bi-racial, uh, adopted child and he was a psychologist in the community, very well respected. He had called me and left a couple of messages, obviously was very interested in talking to me about this referral he had. When I had a chance to talk to him he said to me, [??] I'm so excited I would like you to very much see my niece who's bi-racial. And because of his insistence I said, well, you know, I would like to know what... how come you want me to see... why, what's the reason behind you wanting me to see your, your niece. And he said, well, you know, you're well respected, you have all these credentials and, you know, talked about, um, my expertise in general. And then he said, 'And you're not white toast either.' And I never heard that expression before. It was just like, what? It was just like, did I hear you correctly and I said, I remember saying to him, 'What did you say?' And he repeated it again and I, I said, 'What do you mean?' and he says, 'Oh, you understand, you know.' I said, 'No I don't know.' and I had to kind of pursue that a little bit more because it's a colleague and I just really did not, I mean, I think there was an agenda there. But he had, I felt, a lot of discomfort bringing issues of, of race and bringing issues of ethnicity with me. And that was his way of putting it together. So, it, it was a, it really shocked me. It was a little bit, um, kind of like, I do not understand what it means saying. 

00:08:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO You know, David gave us a good example earlier today when we were, uh, having lunch and I thought it would be relevant to the conversation about the, the job seeking comments that you had about who you are relative to someone else. Who people think is like you and, and so forth. I thought it was a relevant comment. 

00:09:15
DAVID ACEVEDO Uh-huh. That is a good comment. Hmm, I think if I have the right... 

00:09:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Example. 

00:09:20
DAVID ACEVEDO Right, right. Um, it, this had to do with, with, uh, uh, my going on the job market and interviewing at, at these different places. And, um, one of the, the problems I ran into, or situations I ran into is in talking to a similar faculty at one of the places I applied to. Uh, the people mentioning, well, there's a much of, less of a chance of you getting hired because we just hired another Latino. Uh, and it's... so I just sort of sat there and, and was trying to make the connection because it happens to be that, that both of us do work with Latino populations but in completely different scopes of work, completely different [??]. And I'm thinking like, well, did you have this problem when you hired two white people in a row. Or, you know, what, what, was that, was that something different. 

00:10:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO You thought about it too right? Did you think about it the same way? 

00:10:15
DAVID ACEVEDO Hmm, and, and it sorta, it, I think one nice things about that example is that it shows how we, personal and professional lives interact a lot. Um, there's a lot of pressure on me as a job applicant to sort of not upset the status quo in these different kind of things so I, I wasn't really ever sure how to handle... 

00:10:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Respond, yes. 

00:10:35
DAVID ACEVEDO ...the situation (inaudible ). 

00:10:41
LISA COSTAS I think for me it was a, a personal journey of, um, really working with myself at, um, being more empowered and understanding what was happening. Because a lot of what I received happened during my training. And, um, um, it was a, there were comments where I would make suggestions, you know, uh, for clinical cases and the responses were, well, that was really cute and, oh, she's so cute and, and, where did you come up with those. And it just really made me feel that there was something wrong... 

00:11:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO It was invalidating. 

00:11:15
LISA COSTAS Yeah. He said, it's positive, like you are, you're really, you know, you're hitting it on the nose or, you are, you're being put down. And so those types of comments, um, happen, you know, and I finished. And when I remember, one of my professors said, you've got what it takes, you have that, that Spanish thing. And, um, just really gets you very confused and because you're not in a power, uh, equal power, uh, position it's very hard to question or really look at what the intentions are. But then as you do grow as a professional and these things continue to happen then you begin to develop strategies and it doesn't, uh, confuse you or hurt you as much. But it's still something that you have to address and you have to choose. 

00:12:05
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER But you know Lisa, for me, being a Latino woman was a big issue because I feel like I could not really question authority when I went to graduate school being the only Latino there in the program. And people were very well meaning. I had wonderful training but cultural issues were not, that was, that was not clinically relevant at the time. But for me it was my role as my, my own socialization as a Latina that made me, made it more difficult for me to be a little bit much more assertive, you know, cuz I felt like I was being disrespectful. So it was very difficult for me to do that, um, and that's why it's true, um, my same journey, you know, it, it took some time and some growing up for me to get to the point where I'm at right now. 

00:12:45
LISA COSTAS But you feel comfortable, uh, addressing these things when they happen. 

00:12:50
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER Exactly. Exactly. 

00:12:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah. I, you know, it's really fascinating because, um, what can be a [??] microaggression turns out to be something quite macro, uh, because of the impact it has on your life, uh, personally and professionally. And I think one of my rude awakenings to this and, and, I think when you haven't been experienced it, it begins to cause you to stop and, and evaluate and, and perhaps mistrust a little bit before you get back on track. I, you know, I had, um, was born here, you know, grew up thinking that it's, as long as you set your goals and, you know, you get the support you have you keep on and succeed and you succeed and so I had, um, been encouraged to, uh, apply to be the Director of the Guidance program in the high school and it was, I did it reluctantly because I, I was finishing my doctorate and I thought, you know, I don't need this. But I got the encouragement from my supervisor and his supervisor and I know that they were well meaning because they really wanted to see, uh, a person of color in a leadership role and they were very social justice orientated so I trusted them and, and I still believe it was, it was that my trust was well placed. Hmm, and I think when you are in a job search sometimes and get encouragement you sorta get kind of lulled into that (crosstalk)(inaudible ). So, uh, when I got called by the superintendant to, you know, give me the results and I found out that I didn't get the job I was devastated. And, uh, you know, it was, maybe it was an example of, uh, sort of a systems issue in terms of, uh, mac, macro, microaggression but it was a systems issue and frankly they weren't ready to have a person of color be in this leadership role. And it was not the decision of my boss it was the decision of the superintendant who, who decided that, you know, in spite of my credentials that I was not the right person to do this. 

00:15:00
Mistrust and Anger 

00:15:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO And, as I said, I think that it caused me to go through a period of mistrust, um, uh, and, and, and anger, you know. Because I, I saw who got the position and I was further ahead in completing my doctorate than she was so, you know, you really begin to question, absolutely question and, and it was... but it was a very powerful experience for me. 

00:15:30
Use Experience to Find Ways to Face these Situations and Help Others Cope 

00:15:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO So I, I mean, I think that, um, it's something that I use still as a way of, of helping me frame how I approach situations. Um, and, uh, and, and work with students and, and colleagues and say, you know, don't put all eggs in a basket. Just because you're getting everybody telling you this, you know, they're other things in the system that can be barriers. 

00:15:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT That, you know, that reminds me cuz... and I think that there's the weight of experience because you are, you are born and raised in the United States. In my case I'm a, I'm an immigrant into the United States and so, so I came in with a much more na�ve perspective, you know. And there were two things I remember, uh, I, I, I've never forgotten. Number one was, I was having dinner and one of my best European American friends, uh, a family who had bent backwards to help us, you know, settle in and help my father and all that and in the midst of this, uh dinner, you know, the, the husband lash out against Mexicans and Latinos in general because he happens to have a, um, a, a house on a, on a row and what happened that, you know, after farming some of the tractors would drive out through that place and, and somebody has thrown coca-cola cans or, or beer bottle, you know, empty beer bottle. And, and he blame it on, of course, on the Latinos. So, I'm sitting at the table thinking what? What a uncomfortable situation here but I couldn't not say anything so I said, 'Listen, um, I, I, I hope you understand when you say things about the Latinos you're talking about all of us, you know, I'm sitting at the table with you, you know.' And, of course, he turned to me and said, 'Oh no, no, no, no.' (crosstalk)(inaudible ) 'You are not Latino to me.' So, but, but, but, and, and you wonder cuz, of course, this, this was a, a farmer that we had met for a, a social connections. So you, you wonder, well, you know, if maybe there is that just one lost soul. So it brought me to a whole different level. This was not just a lost soul that, it looks much more systemic and my impression is that, based on some of your examples, is that somehow you view the world(ph) then you are assimilated to a different faith(ph) than yours. 

00:18:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO But someone else, someone else tells you you're assimilated. 

00:18:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Ex, exactly. Some, someone else tells you you're assimilated. Well, I see that as an example of, of people from the majority, you know, not able to change their scheme(ph) about Latinos but able to change the scheme about you into a different frame, you know. And, and have you, have you noticed anything like that also, I mean, you got... is that part of your experience too? 

00:18:35
LISA COSTAS Yeah. That you are, um, set aside because it's not you. You are this, this great person, I know you personally, um, but you are not like the others, you are an exception. Um, it happens to me many times about the way I look or the way I speak. You know, so you have really good english. You're very different from. Or, you don't look Latino. You must be from another place. 

00:19:05
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER I was Italian. I couldn't be Latino or I couldn't be Puerto Rican. I was Latino, I mean Italian. That's the way they, they felt, yeah. 

00:19:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Part of the reason why I, I brought these two examples is because we have in this group a very educated group of Latinos and we have talk about some of our personal experiences and, of course, some, some more micro experiences but from an academic and a training point of view, okay. What, what have been your experiences as to microaggression? 

00:19:30
Microaggressions at an Academic and Training Levels 

00:19:30
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER I Carlos, I had a really hard time because I was being taught assessment and I, it was right when I came from Puerto Rico and I had an accent. I'm doing all of these, um, um, auditory closure tests with children and trying to figure out they have learning disabilities et cetera and I used to go to my supervisor and I used to say, 'You know, I really feel uncomfortable. I've been practicing on how to say this right but I just don't think that I'm doing it correctly.' And he was always, '[??] like, come on, [??] you're gonna do a good job.' I had clients and I said, 'You know, I was just sharing with Evite(ph) earlier and I said, you know, I have this client who coming to see me for couples therapy, they really have some, some interpersonal communication issues to deal with.' And he would go, 'No (inaudible ) you need to, have to work on, you have to work on, on, um, you know, women's issues and you need to empower her and she has got to get liberated.' That was the message from... and I used to always clash and I said, 'But I don't see it that way and they're happy and content. He's very protective of her, whatever, I'm not seeing that as a pathological process.' 

00:20:30
Devaluation of Cultural Issues 

00:20:30
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER And all of that. He was always devalue which really created in me a lot of self doubt. Like I was sharing with everyone I had an [??] program, well, you know, I'm coming here for training therefore I conformed. That was the way I cope, coped with it at the time because it was too much pressure and too much little professional stamina that I had at the time, unexperience. And it was at a time in my life that I was really beginning to grow. So that was, for me, the process because then once you... I became then a professional with more confidence then my other expertise would not be seen except for the ones that related to your, you know, ethnic identity. 

00:21:05
You Can Only Work With This Population 

00:21:05
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER So you can only work with this population because you're like this and I said, 'wait a minute, but I have other kinds of expertise.' So, you know, it just goes like I always call it, like a little pendulum, you know, it goes from one that they accept your, they got to accept your, your ethnic identity as part of your professional persona and the other that just goes into not accepting your other expertise because they only see the Latino in you. You know, that's, um, so it's, it's a process I guess that it goes in. 

00:21:35
You Become an Expert in All Latino Issues... 

00:21:35
LISA COSTAS You know, and then, uh, seeing the Latino in you a lot of times in my training was that I was the person, the go-to person for, oh I have a client that is Latino what do you thinks going on with, they said this word in Spanish, or, can you translate this form for us or can you be the one. Not, not looking at all the other abilities that you have but also adding this other burden. Of taking care of things, um, that are, were more, um, organizational, clerical, um, uh, out of the scope of your training. 

00:22:10
DAVID ACEVEDO I just had an experience recently, um, on a research project where somebody asked me to come into the research project. I was very excited about it and then they said, 'Here's your role, uh, we would like you to translate the documents.' and I said, 'Oh, that's good, I can, I can do that. I was a translator before in my life, um, but, uh, what else do I do?' And well, 'No, that's it. We, we want you to translate.' And, and translating is phenomenal profession and I did use to do it but I sort of had to sit back and, and think, I don't think it's pretentious of me to think, I have skills as, a, you know, as a, as a trained researcher and now I'm going to get hired to speak Spanish. So, what I did, I mean, I, you know, eventually I guess we're going to get to talking about coping mechanisms but, but for that [??] 'Fine, I'll translate but I'm gonna charge you, I have a friend that's a psychotherapist, uh, clinical psychology, charges $160 an hour and I think that's what I'm gonna charge you to translate.' So, at which point they said no thank you. And, and they hired a very qualified translator which was fine, that was that persons profession. But it goes to what you're saying. I'm Latino, I speak Spanish, here's a wonderful role for you and you should be so thankful that, that you're involved in it. 

00:23:30
Becoming a Token 

00:23:30
Importance of Knowing Who You Are and Your Ethnic/Cultural Identity 

00:23:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO It's that whole, that whole thing you know with pigeon holing, minimization and, um, and how my own, our own sense of, of racial and ethnic identity has to be pretty grounded in order not to always get taken off base because you never know where something's coming from. And, and normally, whoever the other person is, uh, saying or inviting you to do this wonderful pro, be on their research project it doesn't occur to them, I mean, there's a lot of unconscious racism as we know, um, and, and then other efficiencies and people just say, 'Oh, you know, (inaudible )you're Latino so come and do it.' And, and so, I think we have to be very grounded in our sense of who we are, uh, really be clear about our competencies. What you were saying Lisa. And our abilities so that we can evaluate this, the invite or the comment and say, 'Oh, you know, I don't think so, you know, uh, I don't think this is suitable. I don't have the time.' I mean, sometimes you have to fake it and say sorry I don't have the time. 

00:24:35
Importance of Perspective Taking and Self-Talk 

00:24:35
Importance of Qualifications 

00:24:40
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER Well, you know, you're saying something that, uh, Lisa, that reminds me of, of also [??] intended. Um, in... I've been in positions where they have hired people that are really incompetent but they speak Spanish. And they say, and I say, but the person doesn't have, this person doesn't have the skills, you know, it's gonna affect the population we serve, okay. Obviously it's gonna make my job easier if we get somebody that is more competent because I always say that when you're multi-cultural, you're Latino, uh, clinician, you work twice as hard. But, one of the issues that I, I realize because, 'Maritza, they speak Spanish and you should be happy.' And, you know, I was basically and I said, you know, I answer back and said, 'Well, would you hire them if they would only speak english. Would you hire them for your, for your program?' He says, 'Oh, no.' I said, well, you know, and this is... 

00:25:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO I rest my case. 

00:25:25
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER ...yeah. You know, there is... and that impacts from a systemic standpoint. You know, I, I understand sometimes, uh, it's difficult to find people that are bilingual and they are well trained et cetera but I really believe that systems... and we need to advocate so we can get those and, um, you know, because we do better I think for the populations we serve as well. 

00:25:45
Becoming an Expert in Latina/o Issues 

00:25:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT It leads as well, we are of being a, a token, you know, when you... as you were just saying, and as you Patricia replied with, also, you know, you become the expert on all things Latino. Without understanding that the, the Latino world is so diverse in a sense in all by itself. 

00:26:00
Potential Consequences of Microaggressions 

00:26:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, each one of these experiences have an emotional, a psychological, a social impact on, on ourselves. 

00:26:10
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER And a sense of responsibility... 

00:26:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And a sense of responsibility. 

00:26:10
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER That's, that's, that's really strong for me. Which really puts me in a position and Patricia, you bringing this up and you alluded to that Carlos, is where we are in our identity. How strong we are, you know, how solid we feel because that really helps us, gives us the impetus to do the social justice issues that we need to be followed through. I've always felt that experience a lot of microaggression when I'm advocating for a client that is a minority of any kind. It's, I do, in that process, I go through all of that all over again and how strong I need to be so that I can become a broken record and I can advocate for my client. 

00:26:45
LISA COSTAS You know, when I think the [??] of microaggressions require a lot of energy a lot of times. Especially when you're advocating for a client. Because you're, it, it, it touches you because we have this history that we, we, um, work with and overcome but you're also now trying to help a client and bridge, uh, doors and, and educate and understand so you really have to, um, put all that together and it takes a lot of energy. And I think for me sometimes what happens is I, for example, when you get the invitations, uh, to join a, a committee or an organization or you're work with an agency trying to get your client in and then you receive some of the subtleties and you are not sure, um, is, you know, what is, what is the meaning of this? Um, what do they want really from me. How, how will my client be best served. All these questions you really have to be on your toes and try to figuring, figure it out, um, what is this about? It almost gets you to be, uh, very observant (inaudible ) uh, you know, trusting and trusting the process. 

00:27:56
Re-Victimization or Vicarious Traumatization 

00:28:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, so let me, let me, uh, tie that up with a view of a re-victimization, vicarious traumatization if you look at it from that point of view. When you were with client, when you see the type of experiences they are having I think it remind us probably of our own, you know, negative experiences. So, in that sense it's like you are taken back to a moment of discomfort that somehow you thought you had overcome by knowing who you are, by recapturing your roots. By developing your skills and becoming professionally successful. What, what are the potential consequences of this? 

00:28:35
Additional Potential Consequences of Microaggressions 

00:28:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT You talk about mistrust, you talk about the, the idea of having to become an advocate, to respond for others who don't have a voice. You were talking about the, the energy that, that it takes. You were talking about the, the inconveniences of that, of being put in a situation where they do to you what they wouldn't have done to others, uh, from a different background. You know, I talk about a view of a vicarious [??] or re-victimization. What are the potential consequences for people, uh, who, who are some, sometimes, you know, uh, facing microaggression day in, day out? 

00:29:05
Taxing Over Time 

00:29:05
DAVID ACEVEDO Over time I think each of those take energy like you said and some take more, some take less. We all had stories about microaggressive type episodes that we're still mulling over years later, um, and so obviously those have taken a lot more energy. But, I think, over time they can be so discouraging and, you know, so the story that I was sharing yesterday was, to me, within a couple of years of graduate training. I was done wanting to be in the mental health professions because of the context I was in. Nobody was particularly aggressive, whatever, but they were not validating either. 

00:29:40
Self Doubt 

00:29:40
DAVID ACEVEDO Um, and it wasn't until I fell into, um, relationships with, with people like you all. Involvement in, uh, ethnic (crosstalk)(inaudible ). 

00:29:53
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER I was gonna say to you... always need to have your group of peers at work and... 

00:29:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Your, your network... 

00:29:55
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER ...your network, where you can really check yourself out. It's almost like A.A. You have to really get back together to really... because, it's true, because it takes so much energy, you know, it takes so much energy that, if you don't have that network to really do a reality check your, your skills as a professional get affected. But also personally because you really (inaudible ). 

00:30:19
Doubling Up Your Efforts 

00:30:20
DAVID ACEVEDO You start doubting yourself. That what you're going through is, is real. I remember that part of that was meeting other graduate students on other programs, um, going through the same experience and saying, okay, I'm normal, that's good. 

00:30:30
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER It normalizes it, you know, it just puts it into, into that perspective. 

00:30:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Well, I, I, I have experience of people quitting, uh, in other words, leaving a program because they didn't feel, uh, that they, they wanted to be in a situation like that let alone [??]. I've seen people with depression when it gets to a point when it taxes your, your energies but at a point of really draining you. People with [??], you know, say how, how am I gonna do to overcome this. And I've seen people going the other way around where you, you start doubling up your efforts in order to respond. 

00:31:00
Defense Mechanisms 

00:31:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO It's, it's really a good point as you were saying that, uh, you know, defense mechanisms of some type kick in when, when you experience, uh, microaggressions, as they say, it's not the intent it's the impact. You know, someone may be totally being, you know, they believe affirmative. But, you know, the impact is, it's, it's still there, still, you know, you can get into everything from denying you heard this or rationalizing what someone else said, um, to overcompensating and, and doing everything. Or you believe you have to redouble your efforts and so you have to write the perfect paper in the school, uh, and you, you know, you have to ace each exam and, you know, like, this person who told you, you know, the cultural peace wasn't important, um, you have to figure out a way to still validate that the cultural peace that you saw, you know, from your world view had meaning and importance in this. So, uh, I think the overcompensation is one that, uh, I can attest to. 

00:32:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And one of the things that hits home when I talk about these issues is a layer of, no matter how you do it, you still feel like you're not quite there. 

00:32:20
Validating experiences and coping strategies 

00:32:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO I could say that I've been there but I don't feel like I'm there now. Hmm, I mean, I think it's years of experience, you know, and, and I'm not a... I graduated almost 30 years ago from my doctorate program so, I mean, I think there have been a number of, uh, of experiences along the way that validates you. I think Maritza's point about, um, being in the company of others and, and, I use, you know, we all try to, I think, find the positives. Uh, and the coping, cope, I guess if you want to say it, those coping strategies. So I, I really often say, consider the source. You know, who is making the judgment and, uh, are they the best person to make a judgment about my work, uh, and, and that's, I have to say, uh, how I approach it, you know, if somebody doesn't think it's adequate, you know, um, maybe it's not but on the other hand I have to see who's making the assessment. 

00:33:15
Expect the Unexpected 

00:33:15
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER Yeah. And, and going with what both of you are saying. For me, more than having a doubt, a deep doubt of I'm not making it yet, for me it's more I don't know what I'm going to encounter. That's what is more my issue. The impact isn't in it with me. We have shared all of our experiences, it's just like, well I could have said this other thing, god I could have said this other thing, you know, it's like not knowing what to expect. Like I'm gonna expect one of these situations but will I have the right answer, the right per, situation, the right context for me to take action. That for me it's more what lingers with me. 

00:33:50
LISA COSTAS You know what, in, um, going back to what you both were saying, um, for me it was that process of, you know, of doubting yourself, you know, um, reaching that level of confidence, you know. It's, it doesn't happen for me now because of the years of experience and because I've put it in a different context. But when the students that I teach they said it's helping them and it's very disheartening to see how much of it still goes on. En, empowering them and knowing that this is a developmental process and that they are at the point where perhaps more years of experience, to gain that confidence and, um, to be able to make choices, do I address this, not address that, um, comes into place. 

00:34:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Which leads me to, to, to the question about... cuz I, I had that sense that somehow we're here because we have overcome some, some of those feelings and some of those reactions. But, but, but hearing to what you're saying, you say developmental process, how can we help others, you know, to, to go through this process in a less painful way. Or in a more successful way? 

00:34:55
How can we help others? 

00:34:55
Mentors 

00:35:00
LISA COSTAS You know, I think one of the things that helped me, or, uh, all along was that, um, I was surrounded by great mentors. And at that point they were not Latino mentors. I didn't have any until I got to an internship. But these men and women and the other graduate students saw who I was and my skills and offered great mentorship and, and a reality check and put everything in context. And I, so I think that mentoring peace, um, even if the person is not Latino, uh, it's, it's really crucial. Someone that sees your value and your skills and can provide a good feedback, the constructive feedback. 

00:35:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, mentoring an important peace. 

00:35:45
The term Microaggression as a tool in itself 

00:35:45
DAVID ACEVEDO I, I think even the existence of a term to talk about. Um, so this unintentional aggression, unintentional discrimination, it gives you a tool to be able to talk and to actually to be able to do that. Mentoring and, and like, like you all have been saying it, I think it does get better with experience. Some sort of a testament to that was even conversations we've had earlier today where those of us more experienced said, oh well, you could have done that, or you could have done that and it's like, oh yes, absolutely I could have, I'm not there yet. But, but, so, I think, I think the mentoring peace is important but the having the language to talk about it, peers to talk about it, to start having sort of that social interaction that gives you... you, you labeled it as a skill, a set of skills to react to those un, unintentional aggressive or unintentional discrimination, that is so important to, to, to, to be able to learn the skill or to teach the skill. 

00:36:40
Modeling 

00:36:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO I think the skills is important and, and the modeling. And so I think we're kinda going down the row here talking about skills and, and, um, modeling is a skill, um, just like being mentored. And, and, um, having, learning how to use... actually a lot of our counseling skills when we get into these situations. But I think modeling, as educators, whether we're supervisors or in the classroom, uh, or in a consultation, uh, for that matter, um, we have to be able to demonstrate to students that, uh, what you said in class, even though you didn't mean it, um, that you said, oh, you know, all the African Americans live on that side of the town and, you know, there's a lot of street gangs. And, and, you know, you've just got to say, this, it just kind of rolls off the tip of your tongue, you know. I, as a, a instructor cannot let that go, uh, without asking for more clarification. Can you tell me why you, you know, what... why did you say that and, um, what did you mean by that. Um, and, you know, let's, let's talk about this. So that, um, it's, it, in some way you're making sure the student understands that there isn't, it's not just okay. But that the rest of the students in the class also know that, you know, you just can't say whatever you want to and just drop it there and walk away and, you know, insult everybody in the room. Because, you know, no matter what people talk about, whether it's racism or sexism, it affects all of us. And so we have to, as, as the person, the professional in charge, you know, model that it's not acceptable. 

00:38:20
Confronting in a safe way 

00:38:25
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER But, but you're also adding, you're adding, you're confronting the issue also in a safe way. To allow the students then to have the discussion in the open as you, you basically are saying, hey, this is an important issue. We cannot let go of this issue. And it's not judgmental, it's a way of saying, we need to get to the bottom of this and, and, and explore what this means and I think that, for me, has helped me with my own peers when I have felt like there has been well meaning [??]. 

00:38:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Well, the example you gave about the peer who came up to you and wanted you to see the child. And that person had such discomfort, apparently because they didn't know how to talk about the fact that this was a bi-racial child and you're Latino and so you're 'white toast'. So, I mean, all of that kind of gets in the, in the way because of the discomfort. 

00:39:15
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER Exactly. But, um... 

00:39:15
Importance of Bystanders 

00:39:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT But I also think that one of, uh, um, the big elements of, of this situation are the bystanders. So, the idea is to educate our students to also, uh, realize that they, they have a role to play. And in the sense all the active bystander, you know, skills come alive. Even within the concept of microaggressions. 

00:39:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Exactly. 

00:39:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Cuz we used to, we used to think about them as, as, oh, they are good for open overt racism and all that. And we forget that a lot of time these comments, since we understand some of the ways to, to address these and, and, and we have mentioned others like, for example, knowing who you are, you know, uh, recapturing your roots. But let me, let's, let's move it to the macroaggressions part, okay. 

00:40:00
Macroaggressions and the Latina/o Experience 

00:40:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT How is that in the Latino experience? How does that affect the Latino experience? Especially in times like ours, you know, at this point in the country(ph). 

00:40:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO You know, I never thought it was gonna be 2007. I never knew, I mean, you know, who ever projects ahead anyway. But, but, um, you know, a lot of my research has been with immigration, uh, families, populations. And, and looking back on reading about legislation that was about exclusion of immigrants and so forth. I never thought at this point in my career we would be so anti-immigrant but so anti-Latino. And it, it really affects your sensibilities because you use the term you were all at risk in, in, in many ways because of, you know, how we were born, who we are, uh, that can't change. So, it, it's a, uh, fascinating sucidal(ph) phenomenon, um, that affects not just us, I mean, obviously, uh, just 40, 42.7 million people in this country, okay, who are of Latino heritage. And so, uh, it's, it's as, some of my friends would say it's deep. 

00:41:20
MARITZA GALLARDO-COOPER And, and not to be political cuz this is not the purpose of our conversation but politics and what's happening in our social, in our context has a lot, an impact on our personal and also now work. But I do see a lot of that macroaggression now hidden behind the whole movement and the openness of people talking more openly, uh, against Latinos. And the wall and what they take from us et cetera and it's, it's kind of an excuse. I see that opportunity for express, things that were not done before, at least with my perception, that was not done before, it's being done now. So, that's my concern. My job now is harder. And my own(ph) I have more vulnerability cuz I'm being asked for things that I have never asked, been asked before. Such as, a client asking me if I have papers, see if I have a green card, you know, as part of their interview and by trying to find out who I am. So, you know, things are really changing in some ways and, and, uh, you know, we are at risk. 

00:42:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT How do you all think? 

00:42:20
LISA COSTAS Hmm, I, I would agree that I, I get the sense from clients, talking to students, it's almost like, um, [??] it's okay to publicly say these things that we, we thought we had worked with and which some kind of reached an understanding. At least at the, uh civil discourse and the issues regarding immigration, Latino heritage and all these things. And all of a sudden there's this target. And a lot of, a lot of my students, um, who've just, Latino students who've just moved to the area find like, wow, they're coming from Latino countries and they feel, wow, this is, that's not the welcoming that I thought I was going to, uh, receive, yes, expected. 

00:43:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Especially in Florida. 

00:43:05
LISA COSTAS Especially in Florida. Especially in Florida where Latinos are the, uh, majority, uh, majority minority group. Um, and so it's been very difficult for, um, a lot of the students and, and we see it in the press. Um, we've, we, you know, we've had a lot of, um, immigration raids and families being separated. And a lot of fear and a lot of clients wondering how can they best be prepared if they are picked up and suspected of not having their paperwork. I mean there's even people who are, like you were saying, you know, like us that, you know, were being questioned, um, about origins and, and your status and a lot of assumptions. 

00:43:45
DAVID ACEVEDO It's, it's like you were saying, it's hard because you, you allow, uh, people to have their political beliefs on the issue of immigration. Where it's gets dicey for me and it's gotten dicey is, it's gotten racialized(ph) and it's made it okay to, to blatantly talk about, uh, especially Latino groups but other immigrant groups as well. Um, let's, it, it just makes all these blatant horrific generalizations that are independent from the issue of immigration. I mean, and people don't realize, you know, even with the Latinos there's great variety on feelings about immigration. So, but at, but we all get lumped together and, and, and it's now okay to sort of devalue a group and move on and so that, that he's, I think, increased in, in my personal life the sort of level of, of macro, uh, offences that I, that I perceive greatly and because people go, felt justified now in, in sort of having these discourses and not, you know what I mean? 

00:44:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT (inaudible ) 

00:44:55
LISA COSTAS What I was going to say, one of the things that concerns me the most is the de-personalizing of, of the immigrant, of the, the person doesn't exist. It's just this group and all these negative attributes that are, um, said about the group or the Latino groups. Um, and so from, um, the people that we try to know individually, our neighbors, our community, citizens. It's this group of aliens or it's this group of Latinos... 

00:45:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Oh, aliens, yes. 

00:45:25
LISA COSTAS ...from another planet almost. Uh, it's this need to de-personalize and when we de-personalize then we really devalue people. 

00:45:30
DAVID ACEVEDO It's, and it's easier to attack that big whole. They do that and so... and then if you ask the question, well who are they, because all the, the immigrants that I know don't do that, well not, not the ones you know, but then again, you know, what you saying. No, I'm not talking about those Latino immigrants, I'm talking about other Latino immigrants. And, and, but the truth is that it's made the environment a lot just... 

00:45:55
LISA COSTAS More hostile. 

00:45:55
Current Open and Unintentional Discriminatory Speech as a Macroaggression 

00:45:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And I agree, um, we are in a much more trying time and the, the openness and blatantness of the, of the comments have reached a level that I didn't expect in a so, in a civil society, you know, it, it becomes not only offensive but also, uh, as you said, have a major impact on, on all of us. And I wonder about those that are less privileged than us.
