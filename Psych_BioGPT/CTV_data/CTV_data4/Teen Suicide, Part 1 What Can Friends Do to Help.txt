PRINCIPLES Turning Our Schools Around 

00:00:55
STUART MUSZYNSKI Founder, Project Love More teens and young adults, die of suicide than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia and influenza and chronicle lung disease combined. In 1999, a nationwide survey of high school students found then in the preceding 12 months, one in five had seriously considered suicide and one in 13 had attempted suicide. The latter represents approximately 1.3 million students. Why is this happening and what can we do about it? Our expert today is Dr. Robert Findling, Director of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University Hospitals of Cleveland and we’re joined by my co-host Roger Sidoti, as well as by America’s teenagers. I want to turn to Dr. Findling first. I’m just baffled by these statistics. Can you shed some light on them and… and what’s going on with our teenagers? 

00:01:50
DR. ROBERT FINDLING Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist Well, I think the… the… the important thing that people should always remember is that this is nothing new. This is a long standing fact that has been present for years and years and years. The sad part about it is we often know what causes and contributes to this and unfortunately, very little has been done to really change the way to which it occurs. 

00:02:10
ROGER SIDOTI High School Principal I’ve often noted that umm… the students who tend to talk about it a lot, are students who I believe were crying out for help and they wanted to talk about it, the one's that I’m afraid about are the ones we don’t know. I mean how do we know when a student is really contemplating taking their own life? 

00:02:30
DR. ROBERT FINDLING Well, I think there is no way to really know, but it’s important to understand that depression, clinical depression is a real risk factor and when people think of depression, they think of tearfulness and sadness, but for teenagers they are often actually quiet irritable or sarcastic or cynical. Someone thinks they are just going through a rebellious phase where everything stinks and you stink and school stinks, but in fact, they are suffering from a clinical mood disorder that affects every way that they perceive themselves, their loved ones and their teachers. 

00:03:05
STUART MUSZYNSKI So in other words even… even their own peers might not know? Might just suspect… 

00:03:10
DR. ROBERT FINDLING Absolutely. 

00:03:10
STUART MUSZYNSKI …suspect that so and so is just having a bad day. 

00:03:15
DR. ROBERT FINDLING Everyone doesn’t understand that just like a person can have diabetes that can affect the way they regulate their blood sugar, people could have mood disorders that affect the way they regulate their mood and it’s the exact same principle, but we always don’t always recognize that. So when somebody is in a bad mood or irritable, we always looking for an explanation that occurs out there when often times that actually is occurring within them. 

00:03:40
ROGER SIDOTI Is it better in schools? I know that I’ve heard that some people are really concerned that if you talk about it, you tend to give kids more (inaudible or an idea about committing suicide. I’ve always felt that we should be talking about these things openly with our young people. Is that a healthy way to go or should we try not to do those things? 

00:03:55
DR. ROBERT FINDLING Oh it’s absolutely not always a healthy way to go. It’s the only way to go. We know for a fact that teenagers, you know you’ve got to give teenagers credit. They are smarter than often times we give them credit for. Nobody is going to ever talk about suicide and put a notion in teenager’s head, that wasn’t there before. And the only way we are going to really help teenagers is to make sure that it is something that you can talk about and they won’t be belittled because of it. They won’t be considered weak and in fact that’s the only way we are going to really help change these numbers because we think they are really a lot of things we can do to prevent… prevent this from happening. And remember, suicide is just the tip of the iceberg. Although we know that youngsters are suffering clinical depressions at very high rates. You are a principal, you know quite well how prevalent substance abuse problems are. You put them all together and it’s a potentially lethal mix. 

00:04:45
STUART MUSZYNSKI Now you see the clinical depression that we’re finding in our society today any different in terms of numbers, percentages than we would've found 20 years ago? 

00:04:55
DR. ROBERT FINDLING Interestingly the numbers really aren’t that different. About 5% of teenagers are depressed clinically depressed at any given time and that’s remained reasonably consistent. 

00:05:05
STUART MUSZYNSKI And how is that compared to adults for example? 

00:05:10
DR. ROBERT FINDLING Actually it’s the exact same, but we also know there is about 10% to 15% of teenagers who really hit a wall and really starts circling around the drain and we know the number one cause of that is the new answer of a first episode of clinical depression, because that’s actually when most depressions began, during the high school years. 

00:05:30
ROGER SIDOTI What are some of the signs that… that we as adults, as parents or school people who are working with kids? What should we be looking at, what be one or two things that would immediately should alert us that may be we are dealing with clinical depression? 

00:05:40
DR. ROBERT FINDLING I think the first thing to really alert us is this first significant dysfunction, whether be with peers or in school or at home, because in fact as I just mentioned, teenagers you know they have their bums they will fail a test here you know maybe get into disagreement with their folks sometimes pretty often. But usually their home life won’t fall apart. Their school grades won’t plummet. They won’t lose their friends, they won’t stop being interested in sports or hobbies. Any significant area of dysfunction is not a normal part of growing up and it’s not just a phase and so if there is any significant problems in any aspect of a teenager’s life, it is the probably the easiest flag to consider when you can start looking for other things like their irritability and the other difficulties that accompany that kind of… 

00:06:25

00:06:30
STUART MUSZYNSKI So part of this misnomer it sounds like especially among parents is that they are teens what do you expect. They are rebelling or they are going through a phase or we’ve heard from so and so that so and so went through this kind of thing and we just take our hands off approach, when in fact it maybe clinical depression and it may lead to… 

00:06:45
DR. ROBERT FINDLING Worst things. 

00:06:50
STUART MUSZYNSKI Yeah. 

00:06:50
DR. ROBERT FINDLING And in fact I guess that's… in some regards the best take home message on the positive side of things, which are teenagers are more resilient, more capable, more intelligent and we often times as a society give them credit for. 

00:07:00
STUART MUSZYNSKI Any final recommendations on your part is, well Roger as to how schools can deal with this? I mean you know… 

00:07:10
ROGER SIDOTI I think we need to be open about this Stuart. I… I… I really believe that we talked about making kids and helping kids become responsible adults and part of training I think in helping them become responsible adults is to talk about these types of issues openly with our students and making them feel comfortable to talk with us about those issues.

Authentic Conversations Project Love PRINCIPLES Turning Our School Around Teen Suicide Part1 

00:07:30
STUART MUSZYNSKI Welcome back to principles. We are here talking about teen suicide, the third leading cause of death among teenagers. I want to turn our teenagers. We heard what Dr. Findling said. Has anyone had any experience directly or indirectly with this? 

00:07:45
Principles Teen Suicide Part One www.projectlove.org To request a free study guide 

00:07:45
DOMINIC I have. I’ve had experience more than once attempting to doing suicide and I don't feel the shame to share my story because I feel that it will help someone in a same predicament as myself. I also feel that I have overcome my situation and I’m capable of accepting or been able to take the different pressures of that a teenager may have and go on. 

00:08:10
www.projectlove.org We welcome your comments 

00:08:15
STUART MUSZYNSKI Dominic can you shed any light on some of the factors that led up to your… 

00:08:20
DOMINIC Depression, I was twice diagnosed with manic depression, but I don’t take medication, I’m trying to put my faith in God and different pressures at home led to that. 

00:08:35
STUART MUSZYNSKI So it’s a combination of things. 

00:08:35
DOMINIC Yes 

00:08:40
STUART MUSZYNSKI Is there anything that your friends at school could have done differently that could have helped you along the way or teachers? 

00:08:50
DOMINIC Actually I… I am glad they didn’t do anything differently, because if they had of I might not be here. My friends actually had to fight me in order to take the pills from me and if they not had not enough or if they’ve I guess felt that they should that’s my business you know let me leave her to herself, I shouldn’t get involved, if they had of taken that thought or if they had a thought like that then maybe I might not be here. So I’m glad that they didn’t do anything differently. 

00:09:20
STUART MUSZYNSKI So in your case if your friends had backed off then… 

00:09:30
DOMINIC I would have kept going, yes. 

00:09:30
STUART MUSZYNSKI So, what advise do you give for how friends should be? 

00:09:40
DOMINIC Friends should be honest with their umm… with their friends. So that anytime anything may happen that is severe, that will always feel open enough to come and talk to them. Friends should also be there. They should you know it shouldn’t be a convenient friend friendship or I’m here sometimes not here other times I feel friends should always be there, should be open and just ready to taken in anything and not pass judgment. 

00:10:10
STUART MUSZYNSKI How do the rest of you feel? What do you feel? 

00:10:15
Like she said like if you are… if you are just kinda left to your own device, like if your just there to make your own choice without anyone influencing you or stopping you from kind of going over the edge, then you probably would just keep going. 

00:10:30
I think… I think another thing and I think Mr. Sidoti and Dr. Findling talked about this well. The fact that umm… in some cases it is… it is kind of tough to realize what a person is going through that and some people who maybe complaining suicides or a kind of in… in a depression aren’t really don’t really make it you know clear how they are feeling and they said it is tough to recognize that, that’s way I think as friends we have to make sure that you know anytime we see any kind of small sign you know to maybe investigate, to make sure that you know, you know how this person is feeling and you want to make sure that they are all right and that they don’t unthinking about doing something to the others magnitude. 

00:11:10
When I was younger I… I kind of had a… I guess I could say an experience where I… I thought that suicide would be the best option. I never really like tried to commit it, but it was… it was always on my mind like I… I guess I… I don’t know, maybe I didn’t have the guts or I don’t know but part of the thing, part of my problem was I’ve honestly thought that I was completely alone. I honestly thought that nobody else could possibly understand how I was feeling, nobody else could ever even be, nobody else would consider these thoughts and what actually ended helping me was I sat down with one of my friends and I was like, I have to talk about this, this is what I’m feeling and she was really there for me and I think that that’s part of the reason I never did attempt it, because I realized you know and she actually told me that she'd been thinking the same things herself and that helped so much just knowing that I wasn’t alone and I was… 

00:12:05
STUART MUSZYNSKI That did you feel alone as a result of being depressed or did you feel alone as a result of the way people were treating you or both? 

00:12:15
It was… It was definitely both. Like at that time my relationships with my friends and family weren’t exactly the best and I also was just, I mean my grades kind of went down, things like that I was more irritable like Dr. Findling said I mean, what he was talking about definitely relates and I just… 

00:12:30
STUART MUSZYNSKI (inaudible ) you had a number those risk factors, your grades went, you were feeling isolated… 

00:12:35
Yeah. 

00:12:35
STUART MUSZYNSKI …but was your… was your feelings of isolation and irritability were they noticeable to your parents? 

00:12:45
I don’t think my Mom really thought, you know this must be on you are being dispersed. I think she probably was thinking something along the line well this probably has to do with what’s going on in family life and or maybe school or something. I don’t think she ever would have thought that that’s that I was considering suicide or something. 

00:13:00
STUART MUSZYNSKI Any other opinions here? 

00:13:05
I mean… I’d never experience like wanting or attempting to commit suicide, but I remember getting mad after the fuss (inaudible ) with my mother and I say I rather be dead and here something like that and actually as you grow older you actually realize that life is actually a gift, you are lucky to be able to sit here and be able to learn and other all that stuff because it’s a lot of people they wish they are were in your shoes and you say you wish you were dead when someone is trying their best to help you. That’s just is its not called for… 

00:13:35
STUART MUSZYNSKI So you were trying just to be dramatic? 

00:13:35
Yeah I've been dramatic, but most of the time when you say that you don’t think that its ever going to happen, you just I wish I was dead then you say somebody that you knew or somebody you were under and they die or kill their self you just is like I actually say that. 

00:13:50
STUART MUSZYNSKI Yeah. 

00:13:50
www.projectlove.org To order a videotape copy 

00:13:55
I think is really important for friends knowing to be there and listen like to your friends if they have these problems, but also know where to get them help or how to get them help, I mean if they need it more than just what you can provide for them. 

00:14:05
Principles Teen Suicide Part One 

00:14:05
STUART MUSZYNSKI Yeah for help would you guys trust your school? Would you guys trust an adult authority in your school or is there someplace else your look for? 

00:14:15
Well I didn’t know what to do when this occurred in the class where my friend was trying to take the pills and we had to fight it for her. I was scared, I didn’t know what to do so first thing I ran towards the guidance counselor and told her about herself and that’s when they indicated and got in touch with the female and pulled her in the office and talked to her. At first she was mad at me, but after a while she see how it helped her. 

00:14:45
STUART MUSZYNSKI And you are referring to Dominic. 

00:14:45
Yes. 

00:14:45
STUART MUSZYNSKI Yeah. 

00:14:45
I think she was very… 

00:14:50
STUART MUSZYNSKI So she credits you and your friends for saving her life. Is that what you were saying Dominic? 

00:14:55
DOMINIC Yes 

00:14:55
Because I didn’t know what to do, but I think it helped her a lot. It made her grow when she starts talking to them more and they got to understand her. Coz a lot of people know her in school, but they weren’t think that she will be going through different stuff like that. 

00:15:10
DOMINIC And to add on to that at first you know rebellion kicked in from aggravation like why did you tell them because I didn’t know them and they were just school counselors, but they really are there to help. They really do care. The only thing that I would say is that I think it should be a more open conversation what they do is they pull you separately in a room and they talk to you about the situation, instead I think that is okay, but I think that they should also as a group ask students how do they feel about suicide because it is… we would never really guess how many people at our school or any school have thoughts about taking their lives until we ask and I think that we sort of feel it’s not our place and may the school counselors feel it’s not their place, but I think it is because we are their students so… 

00:16:10
www.projeclove.org To request a free study guide 

00:16:10
I think another big issue is that in this kind of part of the reason we are here to talk about it today, so many people are afraid to talk about it and Dominic you mentioned that sometimes friends are like well that's not really my business and it is your business. Its if you see somebody, I’m so glad that my friend was there for me to talk to and just be open and you know listen to me and I just think that instead of pretending like this isn’t a problem, I think we’d be better to just be open and just be more cooperative and understanding that this is an issue that we face every day and obviously people that we see every day are facing this problem and it is there. 

00:16:55
Authentic Conversations Project Love PRINCIPLES Turning Our School Around Teen Suicide Part1 

00:17:00
STUART MUSZYNSKI Welcome back to principles. We are here talking about teen suicide, and now we’re pulling our panel which includes Roger Sidoti and Dr. Robert Findling together with our students. Want to turn back to you Dr. Findling. You heard what the students said, you heard Dominic’s story. Can you shed any light any more light on this or can you offer any additional advice to what they already said? 

00:17:20
DR. ROBERT FINDLING I think they are… they are all right on the mark. The key is that to have somebody talk about it. I think it is important for a teenagers to be able to turn to each other. I think the one thing I would always emphasis the teenagers is not that a friend is turning to you, it’s not a responsibility you want to bare because certainly if you had a friend who had pneumonia and couldn’t breathe well you wouldn’t want to be responsible for taking care of it yourself. This is the opportunity to make that bridge to somebody who can be sure and help protect the youngster because the good news is many other things that are causing youngster to feel this awful although they may not appear to be a way out there always is. There’s always a better way out and it’s not matter of… if the youngster will eventually feel better it’s simply a matter of when and the only thing that would preclude from that ever happening is if they do something to take their own lives. But that kind of responsibilities difficult enough when you are professional with years of training, more life experiences they just come with age, it’s a responsibility no teenager should bare by themselves. 

00:18:30
STUART MUSZYNSKI Now you’ve heard about Dominic’s two friends. Did you do the same on your own to help Dominic or were you involved with the whole group? 

00:18:45
It is like there was a group of us came from the same middle school. We all… all had the class together so it’s like me and a couple of other friends, that was helping her. But I am the one who went to the counselor and told them her story. 

00:18:55
Principles Teen Suicide Part1 

00:19:00
And even though she was so good that always smiley and so happy you will have to look a little bit further to realize what’s wrong with her. I didn’t go to her middle school, but I… I found out her problems at ninth grade and as a friend you should not just… just because your friend is smarter look at them a little more, don’t just see that smile, look past that smile because she’ll be smiling one minute and you see her later on in day she is on the floor crying. You need to, don’t just think something just happened, her own problems would build up. 

00:19:25
www.projectlove.org To order a videotape copy 

00:19:30
If it’s building up for years since we’ve been in middle school, you can look at, you can look at Dominic and you’ll think that okay well she’s the person that has everything go on the right way, her life she gets good grades, she has a nice attitude, but we as friends can really tell when something was wrong with her. So that day we knew… we knew that something was wrong with her and because we love her as you know more than a friend like a sister, like as sisters all of us. We loved her that much that we decided to take time out of our busy schedule to help her and make sure she is safe and to make sure nothing like this ever happen again. 

00:20:10
STUART MUSZYNSKI Now Dr. Findling, you know you hear their story. You know what strikes me is that these kids having known Dominic from middle school had to be incredibly strong, you know as Dominic said you know they almost had to wrestle the pills away from her. How many kids are gonna be that strong? That’s my concern. 

00:20:35
DR. ROBERT FINDLING Absolutely and that’s why exactly why the suicide rates are high as they are. Because you know doing the right thing is not easy. You know especially you know teenagers, they are starting to develop this pull and push. You know you’re pulling away from their parents. They are supposed to. They are growing up. And they moving towards putting more importance on their peers and they should because they are growing up. But that there is that no man’s land where there is some wisdom believe it or not, with being a parent and there is something about being a peer that has some wisdom too because you can relate better and its finding that mix of peer support and parental wisdom that can come with years and age and maturity that a youngster sometimes has a hard time negotiating had to strike that balance between independence and support and you know ultimately it’s the teenager friend, the peer, the one‘s that they trust sometimes more than their own parents to be able to say you know you’re my friend and I care about you and this is, you know you may not want to me to tell somebody who could help you, but doing the right thing isn't always easy. 

00:21:40
STUART MUSZYNSKI We… We heard what these kids did and it seems to me is though they did it by themselves, I mean although they went to a guidance counselor, how can the educators help them? 

00:21:55
ROGER SIDOTI Well here is an issue, where I think we need to grasp and embrace and say look at. We aren’t capable as educators to really do the job such as the doctor, but we are certainly capable and we should be for the sake of all of our kids I mean these are beautiful young people here to create a climate and culture within a school where they can turn to someone and say, listen I have a friend, she is taking pills or she is contemplating suicide or he is just thinking about ending it all, help us please and that culture has to be say is to start right in that school building and I think it’s the responsibility of very adult out there to insist that culture exist in a school building, so that we can save the lives of the young people. I can’t imagine loosing kids, I’ve lost two to suicide in my 22 years as high school principal. In both cases it was just like someone just yanked the family member right out of our building and it shouldn’t have happened and it’s something that we have to take personally about developing within their culture so kids feel comfortable coming to us and then we steer them into the professional help. 

00:22:55
STUART MUSZYNSKI Any last comments over here from any view? 

00:23:00
DOMINIC I just want to say that if anybody is out there that feels like life is not worth living or if you feel like you can’t go on, don’t feel that way, take my story and use it as an encouragement. There are people they care, there people that love you and go to someone, talk to someone about it. Get it out. 

00:23:25

00:23:30
STUART MUSZYNSKI Commentary Teen suicide is a very complicated issue. It’s complicated for parents, complicated for educators, complicated for society, but most importantly it’s complicated for the potential victims of teen suicide, the teen themselves. It’s complicated for themselves as well as their friends. We as adults need to create cultures within schools, within communities, where this could be discussed, where we allow young people understand that although it’s complicated, it’s the process of caring of one human being caring for another human being, of one human being touching another human being. That allows this complicated issue to be alleviated as we saw in the situation of Dominic, she couldn’t have done it without her friends and I think that her friends are among the heroes we are having in this country. Thanks for joining us. Next week we’ll be back with part two of teen suicide.
