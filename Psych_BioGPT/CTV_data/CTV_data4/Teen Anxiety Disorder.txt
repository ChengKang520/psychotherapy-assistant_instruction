Keeping Kids Healthy 

00:01:05
WINNIE KING ,MD Hello, I'm Dr. Winnie King, and I'm here in the lobby of the children's hospital in Montefiore in New York City. So you can expect to hear some noise in the background. The teen years are supposed to be some of the best years of our lives, fun and care free, right, well not for everyone. For some kids those years can be filled with constant fears, doubts and insecurities. Now some of that's perfectly normal, since they are going through some pretty major changes in their lives, but about 13 out of every 100 teen and pre-teen kids experience something called an anxiety disorder, a level of anxiety that's more than they can really cope with, and that could lead to clinical depression and other serious issues, if they don't get professional help. The two most common anxiety problems are social anxiety disorder in which they feel extreme anxiety about being judged harshly by others or about behaving in a way that might cause embarrassment, and general anxiety disorder in which they experience constant unrealistic worry, that worry might focus on issues like health, family, school, or really something that's going on in the world. These are just passing phases, there are serious disorders, and the kids who have them need help. Today we are going to show you what it is like to live with social anxiety disorder like 15-year-old Mia DeSimone of Philadelphia 

00:02:30
CHRISTINE DESIMONE Mia's Mother Mia was always anxious, Mia was always an anxious child, and especially around other kids, she was very self-conscious, she had a hard time relaxing around other kids, going over another kids house or talking on the phone, she... she was very, it was very difficult for her. 

00:02:45
MIA DESIMONE 15 Years Old I never felt quite comfortable around people, especially in large groups, like I just always felt like there was a difference between me and them. Like I didn't quite fit in with the group that I was with or whatever, and I just felt, like I could never you know just relax. 

00:03:05
CHRISTINE DESIMONE I think around 6th grade she started to have more of the physical symptoms, the sweating, the ringing in her ears that kind of thing. 

00:03:15
FRANK DESIMONE Stomach aches 

00:03:15
CHRISTINE DESIMONE Stomach aches, tightness in her throat, wanting to come home, you get the phone call, she you know she would over friend's house and come back (inaudible ). And are you okay, and just can't be up, and you pick her up and say Mia What's the matter? What happened? And then it was always some kind of , I knew that you want me there or it was just that she wanted to go home. 

00:03:40
WINNIE KING Finally Mia's parents, reached out for professional help, and found out that her anxiety was more than just nervous, it was an actual diagnosable disorder. 

00:03:45
JAMI FURR Mia's Counselor Mia had presented with social phobia so she was diagnosed with a kind of an interfering social anxiety problem, where it was keeping her, um... from interacting with, with her peer um... kind of enjoying extracurricular activities. 

00:04:05
CHRISTINE DESIMONE Mia would describe how sometimes she would be sitting in school, and she fell like things weren't real, things weren't happening, like everything was go... going really fast in her head, and she couldn't figure how to… like to slow things down. 

00:04:20
ANNE MARIE ALBANO , PhD Child & Adolescent Psychologist When we think about teenagers they want to be a part of the group, they want to be successful, they don't want to look bad in front of others, have to look right, feel right, and be included, so imagine if they have a phobic... phobic level, a really extreme level of that kind of anxiety, it sets them apart from everyone else. 

00:04:35
MIA DESIMONE Sometimes I will wake up in the morning, and like as soon as I woke up, I'd start crying, I would sweat a lot, my head would hurt sometimes, like it will feel like in my chest, like I couldn't breathe, and sometimes my stomach would hurt. 

00:04:50
CHRISTINE DESIMONE And Mia what's the matter? Is somebody bothering you? Is somebody picking on you? Is it a teacher? Is it the school? You want to go to another school, and she would be, I don't know what's the matter? I don't know why feel this way? I don't know what's wrong? I don't know? I don't know why I feel like this? But I just wish, I could feel better. 

00:05:10
WINNIE KING One reason for Mia's anxiety may have been her heredity. Her father Frank also suffers from anxiety. 

00:05:15
ANNE MARIE ALBANO We do tend to see that the anxiety disorders as a group tend to cluster in families, that is if you had parents who are affected, it is more likely that the kids may be affected in some way. 

00:05:30
FRANK DESIMONE Mia's Father There is some guilt involved on my part because I have a family history of anxiety and depression, and you know I know that, you know a lot of it was inherited you know, and so I felt bad about that. I tried to talk to her about that. 

00:05:45
WINNIE KING But from Mia's perspective, her dad's anxiety actually had a positive side. 

00:05:50
MIA DESIMONE I definitely felt like my dad understood more I would... I would talk to him, a lot more than my mom 'coz like my mom just my mom just didn't understand. 

00:06:05
CHRISTINE DESIMONE I sometimes felt like I was seeing only the outside for looking in and it would be very frustrating, because there is that part you who just want to say why are you thinking like this? Just stop. 

00:06:10
MIA DESIMONE She doesn't have it so, she will never understand it. She will never fully understand, what it feels like, like I could just keep telling her over and over and she will just never understand. 

00:06:25
WINNIE KING But anxiety disorder is an entirely based on genetics, the environment can play a role too. 

00:06:30
ANNE MARIE ALBANO Parents of anxious children, tend to be overprotective, and over controlling, and then over control is where parents try to make everything right, and make sure the situation goes just right for their child so they don't have to experience a negative event, and again there they are not getting the natural consequences of living in the world, whether it is a bad grade, or the teacher was wean(ph) and things like that, you know these things are gonna happen and over controlling the environment again gives your child a sense that they can't handle the world and they need you to do it for them. 

00:07:05
WINNIE KING Well Mia received the help she needed in part because of her parents, when Mia's anxiety got to a point that it was disrupting the entire family, that's when they all knew they need to get help. 

00:07:20
JAMI FURR Child Anxiety Clinic, Temple University Everybody, you could kinda see what kind of work their way around to accommodate Mia and to make sure that Mia wouldn't get upset and you know wouldn't have a rough day. 

00:07:30
WINNIE KING But there are other signs that parents should look for too. 

00:07:35
ANNE MARIE ALBANO We ask parents to look at a couple of things, we ask them to look at whether the teenager is reporting that they don't like to do ah... social events, school related activities and things like that. Um... and if this is credible or if they have been dropping out of things overtime. Um... Do they have any friends? Do they make efforts to call their friends or the friends always calling them, and what you want to look for is whether reassurance about doing things doesn't matter. 

00:08:05
WINNIE KING Once the anxiety is diagnosed, there are treatments available, Mia decided, she didn't want to take medication, but wanted to give therapy a try. 

00:08:15
JAMI FURR The treatment that Mia, um... went through was 12-weeks long, she had 14 sessions in 12 weeks. Two of which were parents sessions, the first half of the treatment is actually really focused on building their coping skills, so we worked with them as like a coach to help them and manage their anxiety. 

00:08:35
MIA DESIMONE One of the most important things that she showed me was you like earlier, that may be like two weeks after I started, it was this relaxation exercise and like it just felt so weird were to finally be relaxed because my mom would just go on and go on for so long and when I finally relaxed, it was just like Wow! 

00:09:05
FRANK DESIMONE She has coping skills now. 

00:09:05
CHRISTINE DESIMONE Yes. 

00:09:10
FRANK DESIMONE And she gets upset, but it doesn't go on and on and on and on. She'll let it go. She'll resolve it with herself, and now I'm very proud of her in that respect. 

00:09:20
CHRISTINE DESIMONE And one of the things that Jami taught me, her therapist Jami taught me was that it's okay to say, you know Mia now it is not a good time to talk about this, you are upset, and we will talk about it later. Um… And that alone did it, when the kid is really upset and like up here anxious, um... and you saw talking about it, and now the kids just says… just keeps go up with anxiety and gets more and more worked up, and she has learned how to bring herself down, and I can't bring her down, you know, and sometimes, I just, now I know that, I can just back away and say Mia you know now it's not a good time, you are upset. 

00:09:55
WINNIE KING As part of her therapy Mia actually practiced doing the very things that made her anxious. 

00:10:00
JAMI FURR We also had her practice calling, so we had another person in another room with a phone, and she picked up the phone and called and the person was instructed to not answer the phone, because that was one of her fears of the mean um... point of the exposures or the challenges for them to actually feel that anxiety, that they have been trying to avoid. Um... and so because through the avoidance process, it's actually made the anxiety worse. And so we want them to be able to do those experiences and see that their anxiety will actually come down, and not experience it. 

00:10:30
WINNIE KING Now Mia is working part-time in a super market with the public and feeling better than ever before. 

00:10:35
MIA DESIMONE A year ago, I never imagined that I would be able to work with the public, but there will be sometimes it is hard, like sometimes, like the customers have an attitude or whatever, but I think, that in the end this job was definitely like one of the best things that ever happened to me. 

00:10:55
CHRISTINE DESIMONE She felt like you know, she was the only one who felt like this. And this was you know, this was terrible because that she was a weak person, and she you know suck it up and try to deal with this, and therapy taught her that you know, you go for your session and the waiting room is full you know there are other people with these issues too. I mean, it was... it was a real, it was a real eye opener for me, that there are lot of kids out there with anxieties, um... and for her (inaudible ) to talk about it. We were very proud of her. 

00:11:25
WINNIE KING It really is so terrific that Mia is willing to tell us what it's like from the inside and I am sure it's a real eye opener for lot of parents out there too. So as a parent, when is the time to get your teenagers some help? Well, you should pay careful attention if your child exhibits changes or problems in any of the following areas. 

00:11:40
Look For Changes In: -Eating -Sleeping -Schoolwork -General Activity Level -Mood -Relationships -Aggressive Behavior 

00:11:40
WINNIE KING Eating, sleeping, schoolwork, their general activity level. Their mood, like if they start to seem depressed for more than a short period of time, or if you see real mood swings, also the relationships with their family or friends, or aggressive behavior, you need to pay serious attention if you see signs like these, and if they seem to be more than just a brief passing phase, it's time to reach our for help.
