THINKING ALLOWED with Jeffrey Mishlove 

00:00:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome I’m Jeffrey Mishlove today we’re going to explore dream interpretation. With me is Dr. Gayle Delaney the founding president of the association for the study of dreams and director of the Delaney and Flowers Dream Center. in San Francisco Gayle is the author of Living Your Dreams and Break Through Dreaming. Welcome Gayle. 

00:00:50
GAYLE Thank you Jeffrey. 

00:00:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It is a pleasure to be with you. You know some people who work with dream groups have… have come to the conclusion that, there are many interpretations that are possible for a dream and if they are all true, that you know there may be a dozen different schools of psychology let’s say their method is the only correct method and on the other hand people who say their all correct where do you stand in this controversy. 

00:01:15
GAYLE DELANEY, PHD Breakthrough Dreaming Well I think there are many methods that can get the meaning of the dream, but I think there is essentially one meaning of a dream. If your dream is saying you’re in a destructive relationship with an abusive partner your dream isn’t also saying you are looking at the abusive part of yourself that is beating you up. Take the example of a woman in a physically abusive relationship and in the dream a man who looks vaguely like her father and is wearing the clothing of her husband we’ll make it easy is taking her head and beating against the wall and the blood is coming down. Now I’ve heard people say ah… since all images in the dream are part of yourself something I don’t believe to be true. Then that abuser in the dream is your own abusive you, the part of you that abuses you. Well at some level you could agree with that and that the woman wouldn’t be in abusive relationship if she weren’t willing to be abused, but I think you lose the punch in the dream. When the dream is in my opinion clearly stating you are in an abusive relationship, the man you say is so sweet and so kind is beating your head against the wall and you are bleeding and you’re nearly dead do something. So, I think that you could, you can convolute your interpretation so much that whatever nonsense somebody says could be seen to be true like a good astrological reading. But if you really let the dreamer described as various images in the dream, ask the dreamer what those images remind the dreamer of. You will get an “I thou” relationship in the dreams, sometimes the people in the dreams represent parts of yourself, but the dreamer will tell you. In this case the dreamer says that reminds of my husband, you know sometimes it’s like that and I guess it does hurt. I stay right with that meaning and say well is there something you want to do about it. You’ve got to look at it I think that fundamentally there's one meaning of a dream though there may be at several levels and I don’t think there are ever conflicting meanings of a dream what I think you have there is inadequate or incorrect interpretations on one or all parts and one of the ways you know you’ve worked with dream well is when all of the parts fit together in a nice clean line and it all makes sense like a parable or story. 

00:03:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So what you’re saying is no matter what method you use to interpret the dream when the method is done properly it… it clicks and there is a meaning that becomes very apparent. But let me ask you who is it apparent to. 

00:03:45
GAYLE Good point because we've often said dream psychologist, we’ve often said ah-ah, that’s the meaning when you have someone have the ah-ah experiences this is made popular in the late early 60s actually then you know the dream make sense. I’ve had people get ah-ah, so of the most nonsensical shoot from the hip interpretations of their own dreams. For example the woman with the beating husband "might say oh yeah I really understood it” that was my dream about my own aggressiveness toward myself, because she is probably terribly codependent and probably does turn all her aggression on herself but she has missed the point of the dream she still seeing her husband as the sweet guy and she shouldn’t have made him angry. I think it’s tremendously important to listen to the ah-ah that the dreamer has and then put it to the side and say does it make sense, does a whole dream now fall together, do all the images go toward a general thematic thrust and does that make sense. Now the dreamer may get the ah-ah first ideally the dreamer does and then you ask the dreamer to prove it ah-ah how does that make sense in your life and the dreamer will say well not only does it make sense here but it makes sense I do this in my work, I do this in my love relationship so you have a sense of coherence as very solid. Sometimes and specifically and I just done a lot of work with abused woman’s dream. 

00:05:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes that's apparent. 

00:05:05
GAYLE Yeah, yeah and its… it’s very intense work. Sometimes let’s see now where was I. Because I just got involved to another one. 

00:05:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well we’re about abused woman’s dreams. 

00:05:15
GAYLE DELANEY Yeah. 

00:05:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well you’re saying about how dreams come together that once the interpretation is clear. Its… it's seen on many levels. 

00:05:25
GAYLE DELANEY Yeah now in… in a situation where the issue is too painful for the dreamer, let’s say that the dreamer is not aware that she has ever been abused but her dreams are bringing it up very strongly, looks very evident to me because I’ve seen so many of those dreams. I'm may get the ah-ah quickly if for instances the dreamer dreams repetitive about abused little animals, burnt, scorched kittens, starved neglected little puppies. I begin to worry about early childhood abuse. If she mixes aggression with sexuality in her dreams and she is the victim without any recourse or any resource I start worrying about abuse and then I start asking a question she may come right up to the point and back off. 

00:06:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:06:10
GAYLE DELANEY So I may get the ah-ah and I may be able to convince myself this is probably what's going on because I’ve heard it through several dreams not just once, I still wouldn’t say anything I would wait for the dreamer to get there because I think she goes at her own pace and she gets closer and closer each time, but there's this instance where I would get the ah-ah first. 

00:06:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE One of the things that you’ve written about is that it’s usually a big mistake for a dream interpreter or a therapist to steal the dream by… by pronouncing an interpretation before the person you’re working with has arrived at that the insight. 

00:06:45
GAYLE DELANEY Yeah, it is stealing of a dream and I think its bit of a crime, we’ll want to help a dreamer when you have a friend come to you with a dream or one of your clients you know you are getting paid or you’re wanting to be a good loving friend so you want to give the friend something and help the friend who doesn’t know what the dreams about or you wouldn’t be there in the first place and you hear it can't you know, let me or I’ll give you an idea of what your dreams about or I… I’ve heard dreams like this before. So I’m pretty sure yours is about this. In most cases not all but in most cases its mean, let the dreamer figure it out. It’s like doing a puzzle at home and someone comes along and sees the last piece and puts it in for you. Let the dreamer do that I try to train dream interviewers or dream analyst to get their… get their profession jollies or I’m a good dream therapist, not by giving an interpretation, but by asking inventive questions that leads dreamer to put all the pieces together and the dreamer says I got there under my own steam and the next week when the dreamer comes back the dreamer doesn’t say you told me my dream had this but I don’t think such and such. The resistances can go way up way up and you’re in position of having made an interpretation. If on the other hand the dreamer has to come back well you know I thought about my dream this week and I know that I said that but now I really don’t think that’s true then you’re in a great position to say well now let’s see you describe the characters in your dream this way and that reminded you of these issues in your life and so what do you think about it now. Well, now that you say it that way and if only use the dreamers words you know, yes I guess that really was what my dream was about I guess I’m in a relationship that’s not very good for me something like that. 

00:08:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah well we’ve… we’ve been kind of dancing around this issue of… of dreams and I have a feeling some of our viewers may be a little confused about exactly what we were talking about. I think it’s fair to say that you’ve developed a rather unique method of interpreting dreams but its… it’s not so much a method of interpreting, but a method of interviewing the dreamer to help them define what the dream is so you are not imposing your own interpretation, you… you’re not approaching the dream with any theoretical preconception but rather with a methodology for finding out exactly what the dream means. 

00:09:00
GAYLE DELANEY Yes, I try to minimize theory as much as possible you know that doesn’t mean I’m without theory I do believe that dreams are metaphorically meaningful. That they tell you about your life by… by comparing your life situation to the images you create at night and you create those images out of the whole resource you have everything you ever read or thought or experienced. 

00:09:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:09:20
GAYLE DELANEY So that’s a prejudice I have the dreams aren’t meaningless, erratic, zaps of your neurons at night. 

00:09:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE This as some researchers have suggested. 

00:09:30
GAYLE DELANEY Well, actually they've only suggested it but not ever carried it through the… the real line now is well dreams are meaningful to the individual because the individual makes up images that are from the individuals personal life. 

00:09:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:09:45
GAYLE DELANEY Even though a certain brain function triggers it and that brain function is sort of erratic in terms of what… what brain cells get it triggered. 

00:09:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:09:55
GAYLE DELANEY Right, so no one’s got that extreme possession anymore. 

00:09:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:09:55
GAYLE DELANEY That’s taken some doing but I think that’s the case. What I would suggest is that a dreamer can come, you could say you’re my dreamer. 

00:10:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

00:10:05
GAYLE DELANEY Okay and you come and you say I’ve got this dream and its probably my dream it could have been any bodies dream none of it make any sense to me. 

00:10:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:10:15
GAYLE DELANEY Okay so I’d say fine I’ll be your interviewer but not your interpreter, pretend that I come from another planet now this is the key to the dream interview method. I’m going to ask you very silly questions because I want to find out what you think about the images in your dream, not what I think about. So that if you have a dream about a very famous person think of some favorite famous person. 

00:10:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Cary Grant. 

00:10:35
GAYLE DELANEY Okay Cary Grant, I’d say to you whose Cary Grant? What sort of guy is he? 

00:10:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm, now I’ll what you know? 

00:10:45
GAYLE DELANEY And I’d say, no I come from another planet that’s the trap. 

00:10:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah-ah. 

00:10:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE All right and I want to find out from you what you think of him because your images of Cary Grant may be very different from mine or they may be very similar, but even if they are real similar your words are going to be different and it’s the words you would use to describes your images in your dream that one when I reflect those back to you when I recapitulate those words will remind you of something specific in your life, let me give you an example. 

00:11:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

00:11:10
GAYLE DELANEY I had a dream about 15 years ago that I was being kidnapped by Mr. X and taken to the Soviet Union and Mr. X said you will have a German shepherd to keep guard and I woke up feeling both terrible because you know both terrible, and delighted. Now you be my interviewer ask me what’s the Soviet Union like as if you’ve never heard of the place before. 

00:11:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Oh… okay what is this Soviet Union like. 

00:11:40
GAYLE DELANEY Well it’s the workers state where there are no individual liberties. Those are all subsumed for the greater good of the state supposedly but it is basically a dictator… dictatorship. I used to be a Russian studies major and the last place I would like to live, 15 years ago was in the Soviet Union. 

00:11:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:11:55
GAYLE DELANEY All right so then we know that my dream starts out that I mean taken to place where no individual liberties and does not feel good to me. 

00:12:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:12:05
GAYLE DELANEY And then you would ask me well do you know anything about Mr. X and I’d say no and in this case I don’t, expect he’s the agent that makes all this happen and then he’d ask me the key question because this is key image in the dream what's a German shepherd. 

00:12:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE What is a German Shepherd? I’m asking you to define a basic term a term almost everybody knows. 

00:12:25
GAYLE DELANEY That’s right. 

00:12:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Hmm… hmm. 

00:12:25
GAYLE DELANEY Well a German Shepherd is a dog and they are these very proud handsome working dogs and they have a kind of elegance and pride and I love them and I had a number of them, but they are a little bit overly possessive I mean they wouldn’t let a man come within 10… 10,000 miles of me, my German Shepherds would growl and so I thought well know if I’m guarded by a German shepherd in the Soviet Union that’s great because they are loyal, they are loving they are handsome and on the other hand they are overly possessive and they won’t let me move. The minute I had this dream I call that my partner Loma Flowers who did the interview you just did with me and when I described the German shepherd to her she started to laugh and I said oh you know that’s my husband Steve and I would never have guessed it, by any great exotic interpretive structure or methods I wouldn’t have gotten to my husband but when I use those words as of exactly words I described my husband and sure enough that dream came the night after we had a major fight over my going to do a television show in Detroit and Steve is telling me that, oh I might be killed by the cab driver or might be in a car accident, besides I shouldn’t go and be off without him for a night, and it’s been a little bit over possessive. 

00:13:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:13:35
GAYLE DELANEY But he was also strong and handsome and wonderful and protective and Steve’s response to that dream was well you know what do you expect, you picked the German shepherd and its true I picked it. Now if instead in that dream you had said to me ah-ah all the images in your dream are part of you Gayle then I would prejudice my description of that German shepherd. 

00:13:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:14:00
GAYLE DELANEY It wouldn’t be as non-defensive, it wouldn’t be as free. I had no idea where I was going like that description and it was easy to give, so I let the dreamer chose is it a subjective meaning or is this image a part of you a subjective interpretation level or an objective is it the German shepherd reminds you something other than you. 

00:14:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But you are not asking so explicitly as that you are simply saying define a German shepherd, define the Soviet Union and then as the definition comes out the dream begins to interpret itself. 

00:14:30
GAYLE DELANEY Exactly. 

00:14:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That’s the key to your method I… I gather. 

00:14:30
GAYLE DELANEY And I guess I would say it is define and described, what the personality of the German shepherd. The key question is what is the Soviet Union and what is it like. What is a German shepherd and what are they like, that word like and I discourage people from saying what does the Soviet Union mean to you, because you don’t know or you wouldn’t be asking for help on your dream and the minute I start thinking what does it mean to me I get interpretive, but if I just want to tell you from another planet what are German shepherds like I can tell you just like that. 

00:15:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So you forget about saying with reference to the dream, you just say well to me a German shepherd is, but then don’t you sometimes go back and say in this dream what was this German shepherd like or something like that sort. 

00:15:15
GAYLE DELANEY Yes, let's say in my dream my German shepherd had a oh! Had a little bit of Dalmatian skin to it, you know part of it was German shepherd, but I also know it was a Dalmatian and so I’d say a German shepherd is like this but in my dream this German shepherd was a particular one it was like a Dalmatian, and Dalmatians are fire engine dogs they are very good in emergencies that would bring another bit of color to the dream. 

00:15:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

00:15:40
GAYLE DELANEY So I always want to know from you a good description of your images both what they are generically what's a German shepherd like and what was the one in your dream like. 

00:15:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:15:50
GAYLE DELANEY And then you tell me and I don’t have to tell you what your dream means what your image means I don’t have to tell you whether it’s a subjective or objective interpretation, I don’t have to tell you if it’s an archetype. I don’t have to tell you any of that I stay out of the way. 

00:16:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:16:00
GAYLE DELANEY I’m trying to get you to tell me because you know since you made up the dream. 

00:16:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well it sounds very much as if you are a good friend of mine and I had just visited another city and you are coming and asking me tell… tell me about the visit what was it like and I describe it that way now union dream interpretation is often based on the idea that a symbol or a story that appears in the dream can be interpreted by looking at mythology or Alchemy or you know the ancient traditions of humanity and… and the notion that… that the collective unconscious the encyclopedic store house of human knowledge is sometimes called the objective un… unconscious contains the key to interpreting these dreams. I gather that in your method is quite distinct from that. 

00:16:50
GAYLE DELANEY It is I had planned to be a union analyst, I did union analysis in New York and went to Zurich for a year and I found there's a major problem with this approach its… as if you were to tell me a dream and I would interpret your dream according to a dream that Fred had, I said listen I know what your dream means Fred had this dream or such and such a culture had this dream or told this myth I don’t want to interpret your dream according to other peoples meaning systems and where we get into particular trouble with that system, if it is not handled very well and it can be… it can be handled well but very often it doesn’t, is if you happen to be a woman got a problem. We are dreaming… we’re… we’re interpreting your dreams according to cultures were women didn’t live their lives they live today, according to Jung and anybody else you may want to think of who had a life, well the last woman got to vote in Switzerland where Jung lived this year, no in 1991 that was the last woman who got to vote. Jung died in 1961 I think and many women couldn’t vote at that point, it was 1972 when most women can vote in Switzerland. So he had a rule for women where you know in a very constricted place and I think the role allotted to women in mythology is constricted, thanks to certain work like Chenango Berlins(ph). We’re enlarging the scope of how woman can think of themselves in reference to history. 

00:18:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well we’re rewriting mythology as well. 

00:18:15
GAYLE DELANEY Yeah that’s true that’s what I want to see a much more rewriting because we have new goddesses, we have new woman with new roles and new issues and the whole interplay between male and female is so much more varied so my feeling is I get completely out of the way of all of that kind of belief system and if someone says to me oh! this is the archetype of such and such I say well fine what's that I never heard of it before I read the collected works at least once all of it and I act as if I never heard of Carl Jung or anything he's ever said because everyone has his or her own meaning system, and I want to follow that meaning system if for instance here's a major trap someone will dream about let's say a man will dream about woman at work, let’s say you dream about Judy. 

00:18:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

00:19:00
GAYLE DELANEY And you could say to me oh! I know Judy she is my enamor or this female part of myself, I say well fine what is that? What is this female enamor and you would say well this is part of myself, its feminine, and I say what is feminine, I come from another planet we don’t have those two sexes, we have several others but not male and female. So I get to find from you today in the context of your dream what you have think feminine in is and that’s my world order from that point on. I follow that system which may be different for you, as even you might be calling it Jung. 

00:19:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE What sounds like what your are saying is that when we interpret our own dreams through the lens of various psychological theories we’re distancing ourselves from our own unconscious mind. 

00:19:40
GAYLE DELANEY I think so. 

00:19:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE From our own inner wisdom. 

00:19:40
GAYLE DELANEY Its an academic step that moves you away from your immediate experiences in most cases now there are exceptions to this, but generally speaking why bring in a label why not stay with Donna whom do we have Donna in your dream or Debbie stay with Debbie tell me about Debbie what's her personality like what does that remind you off and you’d say oh God it reminds me of the part that is like this, that’s a little clear then the female part of you because I need to go for feminine. 

00:20:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:20:10
GAYLE DELANEY And its different from you because you identify masculine so I just assume leave those terms out and leave them in for academic discussions afterward, but not in the time that you’re working with the dream. 

00:20:20
GAYLE DELANEY Now I… I do have a trouble though with the very concept of interpretation of dream it… it… it seems to imply a sort of finality to it and al… almost like once a dream is interpreted it becomes dead, somehow or frozen in… in time is… is that how you see it. 

00:20:35
GAYLE DELANEY I think the deadness that comes after interpretations is a sure fire signal that is wrongly interpreted. 

00:20:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:20:45
GAYLE DELANEY Where you have taken a formula plastered over your dream and now means this and its dead, it’s not alive, that’s because you haven’t gotten the meaning of the dream. 

00:20:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:20:55
GAYLE DELANEY I’m just bet you most times you just plaster something on that is supposed to me, but it is not you it means out there if instead the dream reminds you of this in your life, it reminds me my German shepherd dream, it reminds me, it’s so live 15 years later because it… it crystallizes aspects of my husband and part of the struggles that I have with that it’s so alive this is not a dead dream but I didn’t decide I decided what it meant and I don’t even need the word interpretation I could live without that word. 

00:21:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:21:20
GAYLE DELANEY But I use it because most of us do. I interpreted that animal to be like my husband and I love German shepherds, I have troubles with German shepherds so it reminds me of all that at once it doesn’t just say the German shepherd means my husband then I lose all the richness of German shepherdess. 

00:21:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well but when you say that when the dream is interpreted everything clicks together you can see all these levels of meaning at once. It seems to imply a… a sense of finality to it and I’m… I'm wondering. 

00:21:55
GAYLE DELANEY There can be fullness. 

00:21:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:21:55
GAYLE DELANEY And there might be some level of finality but you have to always be open for new levels of surprise. 

00:22:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:22:00
GAYLE DELANEY Years later because reviewing your dreams over the years gives lots of insight and how well you work with your dreams and let’s say that the dream falls into place very well it make sense, it reminds you of this it makes things click into place in my life now that’s in the moment of interpreting the dream. 

00:22:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:22:20
GAYLE DELANEY I could forget that very easily if I don’t live that out and one of the key things I say to people and say over and over again is that insights and good interpretations or a dime a dozen they are easy and you forget them by the next day and they don’t change your life. 

00:22:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:22:35
GAYLE DELANEY If you don’t live with how you understand your dream that’s why I call an interpretation how you understand that what it says to you. 

00:22:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:22:40
GAYLE DELANEY Try it on during the day for at least in… intense week thinking about it, talking about it with if its appropriate, my case of my husband. 

00:22:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:22:50
GAYLE DELANEY Then the dream becomes part of you, you look back on the dream and it’s so obvious it’s like a biblical parable it’s so evident what it was about. But its… if its dead then you’ve done something wrong, it should be much more alive and oh wasn’t I creative to thought of that, didn’t I highlight certain qualities well with that image. 

00:23:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well when you say live the dream I… I get the feeling that you are saying take some action based on the insight. 

00:23:15
GAYLE DELANEY Action would be nice, but often we can’t do action for a long time. So what I ask for is reflection, at least twice during the week reread your dream think about it and if there's some obvious sort of action to become in the case of the battered woman less terrified that she do something, it might just be writing more in her journal about her feelings that she read a book on the issue that when she is walking down the street she thinks she is a little bit braver takes just a little risk to… to say no to someone when they try to push her off the curb or something. 

00:23:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:23:50
GAYLE DELANEY To take tiny little steps but sometimes and often actually we dream way before we are ready to make the move and so I try not to push action though my natural personality is action, I’ve learnt through years that you can’t push it. You have to have people dream the same dream over and over again until they are ready to make the move and so yes action would be nice but if you are not ready for action reflect on it. 

00:24:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. What about recurring dreams did these suggest to you that somebody might be stuck that… that they really need to take action when a dream keeps reoccurring. 

00:24:20
GAYLE DELANEY Yeah in fact if you have recurring dreams and you certainly have a sense what it is about and you keep having the dream get yourself immediately into therapy. You need real help a little you know a nudge, someone to help you look at how your holding yourself back because recurring dreams are like are record on a skipped place you’ll never get on to more wonderful music and you keep having to listen to the same stuff over and over and I’ve got people tell me dreams I’ve had for 20 years and sometimes they have been analyzed oh yes they understand what the dream meant, the psychoanalyst said this, the union analyst said this but they presented it that way the analyst said my dream meant. 

00:25:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:25:00
GAYLE DELANEY Rather than I understood my dream to be about this, you know it just surprised me when I realized what these images were about. One fellow had a dream of about 20 years in which he was a wizard awake and the dead man wasn’t quite dead and the dead man started moving the finger and our dreamer would get anxious, because he’d have an idea what was coming next he’d get sort of lucid in the dream aware that, ah I remember this dream and so he go and hide behind people and you hide behind palms, you know the nice palms that wakes, and the dead man will get up and look at him glazed eye and wherever dreamer went the dead man will be able to see him. He'd wake up in a cold sweat. 

00:25:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:25:40
GAYLE DELANEY So how long if you been having this dream that’s the first thing you want to ask yourself about a recurring dream and you’d probably been having the dream just about the same amount of time you’ve had the particular problem the dream is helping to deal with. 

00:25:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:25:50
GAYLE DELANEY Say there is a dead man and in this dream the dead man wasn’t quite dead and everyone wanted to think especially the dreamer wanted to think he was dead. All right so is there anything going on in your life for last 21 years where you would like to think it’s dead because you didn’t get a lot of descriptions, but it is not dead and wherever you go it haunts you. He said well I chose my career 21 years ago my father wanted me to be an engineer I wanted to be a pianist, I became an engineer. 

00:26:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Oh… 

00:26:25
GAYLE DELANEY And so it looked like you know again that’s much as we got, it looked like that was the case. He called me up in a a couple of months. 

00:26:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:26:30
GAYLE DELANEY And he had never gone to even concerts after this he was so heartbroken about not playing and he started going to concerts, that’s not a big deal but he did a little something to be with the music he loved. 

00:26:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:26:40
GAYLE DELANEY And he didn’t have the dream three years later he called me up again because I said let me know and he never had the dream again. I think he got through that he had to deal with something he couldn’t undo 21 years later but he could modify the pain. 

00:26:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Fascinating, fascinating. Well, I have had a recurring dream myself maybe we can discuss a little later for… 

00:27:00
GAYLE DELANEY Okay. 

00:27:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …for those of our viewers who are interested in our discussion with Gayle Delaney we have an hour follow up not for broadcast but as part of Thinking Allowed inner work collection that will be available from thinking allowed productions. Gayle this has been a fascinating discussion with you I get the feeling that we were not only get into some depth in terms of the usefulness of… of dreams and… and understanding ourselves but also a… a sense that you’ve got some real particle tools for getting at the meaning of dreams in specific ways and yeah. 

00:27:35
GAYLE DELANEY That’s been my goal. 

00:27:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah… ha. 

00:27:35
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

00:27:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Thanks so much for being with me. 

00:27:40
GAYLE DELANEY Thank you Jeffrey. 

00:27:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And thank you for dreaming with us.

THINKING ALLOWED with Jeffrey Mishlove 

00:28:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello again I’m Jeffrey Mishlove back with Gayle Delaney and we’re going to spend the next hour going into greater detail on the interpretation of dreams. Gayle let’s talk for a few minutes about the spiritual dimensions of dreams. You mentioned to me that you have actually had some experiences interpreting dreams of various gurus and spiritual masters. 

00:28:55
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. Let me say that the way I look at our dreams I don’t know exactly where they come from, I don’t know who sent them to us or how we create them you know I have a lots of ideas too but that’s not crucial what's crucial to me is to see what are the fruits of dream work. 

00:29:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:29:10
GAYLE DELANEY What good does it do in your life. So from that perspective I don’t judge one dream as being more spiritual than another. 

00:29:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:29:15
GAYLE DELANEY What I noticed when I work with people’s dreams looking at the dreams as if they are metaphors. Is that our dreams help us to love ourselves love other people in our world and be creative within our world, to do work that’s meaningful, to relate others in meaningful ways. So what's not spiritual about any of that. 

00:29:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:29:30
GAYLE DELANEY I’ve never found a dream that isn't spiritual and I’m dismayed when people come to me and say oh I’ve had a lucid dream or I’ve never had a dream of a flying horse and my dreams are very spiritual and what I try to show is whatever your dream is about its always helping you to live better. 

00:29:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:29:50
GAYLE DELANEY That’s your task and there's not one higher than another remember something that Dr. Casey said to someone for whom he gave a reading once back in the 30s I guess. He gave a reading for two sisters who asked about their dear little brother who was just a drunk in the bowery and what they could do about him and they prayed for him and nothing seem to work and what should they do about this terrible brother. 

00:30:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:30:15
GAYLE DELANEY And Casey spun into, his put everyone into psychotic records, his trans states. 

00:30:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah-ah yes. 

00:30:20
GAYLE DELANEY And he said you know this is the most evolved being for whom I had ever given a reading and he didn’t have to come he came back this time to give you two a lesson to lover him no matter what even though you couldn’t save him you couldn’t change him, he’s only here for you as a gift for you to love him in spite of the fact that he lives in a way that you find so dismal. 

00:30:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:30:45
GAYLE DELANEY I thought that was a rather sobering experience I had very early on in my interest in dreams back in early 70s. 

00:30:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:30:50
GAYLE DELANEY And sure enough when I look at the Gurus dreams you know their dreams are about love, relationships, loving themselves, being honest with themselves about being creative in the world. 

00:31:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:31:05
GAYLE DELANEY One particularly comes to mind of… of a wonderful person who had this terrible sadness about being lonely in life whenever she needed somebody nobody was there for her. 

00:31:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:31:15
GAYLE DELANEY And her dreams would show the need to connect with other people older women or people to whom she felt on whom she felt she could lean and what those dreams brought up for her was how she had created a world where she walks around saying I am holy and I am the one who will hold you altogether and I’m somewhat superior in a… in a loving way but nevertheless she will, put people who felt somewhat inferior and more needy then she. 

00:31:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:31:45
GAYLE DELANEY And so she had any needs they were gone. They didn’t know how to do giving and dreams would say this again and again. The dreams weren’t talking about the golden spheres often the Netherlands of other dimensions sometimes they would but the dreams will also deal with you’ve got to learn to be humble if you see another friend be needy that’s part of being human. 

00:32:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:32:05
GAYLE DELANEY A… a number of Gurus have a major problem with the power and control issues, they need to be in power and in control and their dreams were all about that furthermore they are followers dreams whom might see are about that and I will see again and again certain leaders being represented generally as abusive fathers it is not uncommon at all. 

00:32:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:32:35
GAYLE DELANEY Who take advantage of volunteer workers and volunteer groupies you know come adore me come love me, the dreams both of the followers and of the leader who will show the same dynamics and the sickness of both those dynamics. 

00:32:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:32:50
GAYLE DELANEY So what I want to say about spiritual dreaming is all your dreams are spiritual about every issue, if your dream is only about your boyfriend if its only about your body image that’s very important what could be more important than how you love someone intimately and how you respect your own body, you care about your body or if you are ashamed of your body or somebody hurt it, there are no dreams that aren’t spiritual and I don’t see anybody that I could say as more spiritually advance then then since somebody else for sure especially when I think of the Casey reading. 

00:33:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah, yeah. 

00:33:20
GAYLE DELANEY And I think that is a helpful way to approach someone’s dream and the dreamer knows that you are seeing that person that way. 

00:33:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah-ah. What's a very Zen attitude in a certain way whatever is happening is… is it at the moment you have to deal with reality as it presents itself and yet there are categories of dreams and altered states of consciousness that seem to be you know so different from the normal that we often think of them as spiritual lucid dreams out of body states, precognitive dreams. 

00:33:55
GAYLE DELANEY Well that because you’re calling, the dream is about the tomatoes in the grocery store a non-spiritual. 

00:34:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:34:00
GAYLE DELANEY What's not miraculous about the tomato and we have grocery stores that can feed us. So when you can look at the part that you denigrate the part that’s only mundane. 

00:34:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah… yeah. 

00:34:10
GAYLE DELANEY But then look at these are the dreams, let’s say a precognitive dream. 

00:34:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:34:15
GAYLE DELANEY A dream in which you have these experiences that someone you love is going to die. 

00:34:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

00:34:20
GAYLE DELANEY Right most of those dreams have nothing to do with the future. JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:34:25
GAYLE DELANEY They have much more to do with what’s going on in your life now, what do you think of the person who died let’s a dream of your father dying. 

00:34:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Alright. 

00:34:30
GAYLE DELANEY Alright what's your father like what it would be to you if your father died. 

00:34:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:34:35
GAYLE DELANEY That might be much more an issue right now in your life for better or worse, if your father dies, depending on your relationship with him in the dream. 

00:34:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:34:40
GAYLE DELANEY But let’s say it’s a dream that you have, you didn't know your father was ill and he dies the next day. 

00:34:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:34:50
GAYLE DELANEY That would suggest to us that you had more than luck on your side because you had the dream and close proximity within three days let’s say. 

00:34:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:34:55
GAYLE DELANEY And my feeling is it doesn’t do you any good to say that you had a spiritual dream, it does you good to say did the dream help prepare me in a little way for this disaster, well not disaster necessarily. 

00:35:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

00:35:05
GAYLE DELANEY But for his loss this pain. 

00:35:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. Well. Hmm… hmm. 

00:35:10
GAYLE DELANEY So I just read the dreams in a non-heroic fashion. 

00:35:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:35:15
GAYLE DELANEY Which I think it was all of our dreams more meaning and more fullness. 

00:35:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:35:20
GAYLE DELANEY Lets take flying dreams, lots of people feel that those are imagery for out of body dreams that when you fly in dreams you always out of body well I don’t know and I don’t know who knows that, but some flying dreams are wonderful there are joyous and you have a sense of beauty and power and giving that goes with lot of things we called spiritual in the world. 

00:35:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:35:40
GAYLE DELANEY Wonderful call it a spiritual dream. If on the other hand if you have a dream where your flying and you are the, it is just a common one you’re the only one whose flying and none of your friends can do it and they can't touch you. Well are you running a superiority number in your dream that you also do in your waking life. 

00:35:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:35:55
GAYLE DELANEY I can tell you a lot of people do who run their I’m very holy. 

00:36:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:36:00
GAYLE DELANEY Look and then they have lots of dreams of flying and being the only one who can do it and they are very proud of that. 

00:36:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:36:05
GAYLE DELANEY What joy is there in that? What about the person who dreams I’m flying and I see some people and I teach them how to fly and then I fly with them, or I just have flight and beauty and I’m practicing my courage to be able to fly in spite of the fact that people are watching. 

00:36:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:36:20
GAYLE DELANEY Those are different kinds of emotional issues that have been dealt with. Another flying dream is and a very common flying dream I’m sorry to say is where you are flying to escape a bad situation. 

00:36:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm. 

00:36:35
GAYLE DELANEY That’s usually not very helpful. 

00:36:40
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

00:36:40
GAYLE DELANEY Why were you in your waking life flying away from, it is not unlikely a disassociation dream. 

00:36:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:36:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE People who have been… woman who have been… and I suppose men but I’ve haven’t heard it for men. Woman who have been abused in childhood often have dreams of flying out the top window flying out and often the bad guy the mad scientist or the father type image. 

00:36:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:36:55
GAYLE DELANEY Will come and grab them and they never do get away and pull them back in. 

00:37:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:37:05
GAYLE DELANEY Flight is sometimes the best you can handle but I wouldn’t say it’s the best way to deal with. Find out who this bad guy as and dealing with him. 

00:37:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:37:10
GAYLE DELANEY So again that takes us to lucidity. If you think of dreams been more spiritual where you are lucid… in another words you’re aware of the fact that you’re dreaming while you're dreaming. Ask yourself what are the fruits of that lucidity. 

00:37:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:37:25
GAYLE DELANEY Has that helped me to live what I think is more spiritual life as you define it. 

00:37:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm. 

00:37:30
GAYLE DELANEY Well let’s say I have lucid dreams where I know what's going on in the dream and I don’t know like what's happening so I make a happy ending. Or I fly off and go make some other happy ending. Let’s say the animals are about to devour me and I’m so terrified so I go off and I make love(ph) to a flower I go off to the beach. 

00:37:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:37:45
GAYLE DELANEY What have I done, have I understood the problem? 

00:37:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well isn’t there a tradition in forms of lucid dreaming a confronting the monster or if going back and making a friend out of the monster are that running away. 

00:38:00
GAYLE DELANEY You know what… what happened with the whole lucid dreaming business a lot of us were taken from the so called Senoi practices. 

00:38:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:38:05
GAYLE DELANEY Which weren’t apparently anything like what Kilton Stewart then wrote up as his study of the Senoi and… 

00:38:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Kilton Stewart was an anthropologist who popularized the… the idea that the Senoi where a tribe of people living in the jungles of Malaysia who… who shared their dreams all of the time and… and were… 

00:38:25
GAYLE DELANEY Had no illness and had no crime of course every culture has 1% schizophrenia there was crime in their culture and there's a lot of misrepresentation. 

00:38:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So it… it became sort of over blown a little bit we… we romanticized the… the Senoi. 

00:38:40
GAYLE DELANEY In fact the whole… the whole principle that when something bad is happening in your dream. 

00:38:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:38:45
GAYLE DELANEY You become conscious that and you kill of the bad guy. 

00:38:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:38:45
GAYLE DELANEY Now what's sense does that make therapeutically not any therapist I know would ever say ah-ah we… we demolish whatever is bad. 

00:38:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But what about facing it, confronting it. 

00:38:55
GAYLE DELANEY Facing it okay that I started mentioning back in the early 70's say no let’s not do this from Yung. 

00:39:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:39:00
GAYLE DELANEY When Yung kept saying face the shadow deal with the shadow. 

00:39:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:39:05
GAYLE DELANEY And sure enough you can do that, you can say oh I’m having this dream again this bad guy is coming after me I want to fly away I’m not going to do that. 

00:39:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:39:10
GAYLE DELANEY Who are you? What do you want? 

00:39:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:39:15
GAYLE DELANEY Ask a question don’t go Stewart taught you should turn and confront I don’t think that ever happened in the culture he studied and you should kill off the bad guy that’s not going to win anything, but find out who the bad guy is in your dream what conflict is he represent for you, who are you? What do you want? And the dream with either have the character will stay to speak to you with explanatory… 

00:39:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:39:35
GAYLE DELANEY …lines or it will take you into another dream image that will make it a little easier to deal with. Okay so how do you use your lucidity? Do you use it to explore or to run away from. 

00:39:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:39:45
GAYLE DELANEY And make happy Pollyanna Indians, how do you use it? 

00:39:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The sense that I have is that’s quite useful to… to convert these fearful images , the shadow like images into allies to discover in them some connections someway of relating someway of gleaning value. 

00:40:00
GAYLE DELANEY If you also take into account their negative side. 

00:40:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:40:05
GAYLE DELANEY If instead you’d… you’d say here is this terrible gorilla coming after you, and you say but you have nice eyes gorilla and you just deal with the nice eyes of the gorilla and not the ferocity and the destructiveness of your gorilla in your dream. 

00:40:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:40:20
GAYLE DELANEY Then what you're doing is probably doing what you're do while you're awake looking at the nice stuff not looking at the problem that is threatening to you. 

00:40:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:40:25
GAYLE DELANEY If instead you say okay there's something in my life that’s like a gorilla that’s terrifying to me that threatens my whole life. 

00:40:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:40:35
GAYLE DELANEY And I know I like its eyes. 

00:40:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:40:35
GAYLE DELANEY What does it remind you of in your life then you deal with the problem your dream is saying you looked during the day and you ignored me. Let me tell you there is a problem here deal with it. 

00:40:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:40:45
GAYLE DELANEY And recognize it so I’d say yes but again try not to move just toward the pleasant deal with what's unpleasant because that’s the gift of that dream I think. 

00:40:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. But now when you work with people in… in your method of interpreting dreams do you give them instructions like that you tell them deal with this? 

00:41:05
GAYLE DELANEY Not in the beginning in the beginning I say tell me your dream, describe all the images in your dream what do these descriptions remind you off in your life that’s what I do. 

00:41:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. Yes. 

00:41:15
GAYLE DELANEY But let’s say the dreamer comes in to me saying I really want to be more spiritual being and have more lucid dreams. 

00:41:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:41:20
GAYLE DELANEY Then I’ll describes various ways of working with lucidity. 

00:41:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

00:41:20
GAYLE DELANEY And I will push the idea of use it to explore rather than to escape or to avoid or deny. 

00:41:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:41:25
GAYLE DELANEY And I actually say that some people who have read my books they already know it. It’s not as if it’s a big secret you know many of my clients have already done that. 

00:41:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:41:35
GAYLE DELANEY But I don’t do it unless someone brings up the lets the lucidity issue or the flying issue generically. 

00:41:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:41:40
GAYLE DELANEY What I try to do is first just work with the dreams specifically see what the dreamer did. 

00:41:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:41:45
GAYLE DELANEY And then ask the dreamer and is this how you would you know like to deal with this so you ran away from the gorilla and you woke up because you are so terrified. Let's tell me more about this gorilla, describes him, does this remind you without saying what we’re doing the dreamer is now getting back into the gorilla the scary part of it and then the dreamer will usually be able to say ah… this reminds me of some part of myself or someone in my life and then we talk through how is that similar does it really fit okay, and is there anything you want to do about that. Do meaning reflect as well as act. 

00:42:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah, do you have your clients occasionally continue the dream a sort of like a hypnotic state? 

00:42:25
GAYLE DELANEY Yes. 

00:42:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:42:25
GAYLE DELANEY, PHD Breakthrough Dreaming I might say suppose you didn’t hadn’t awakened and here's the guy and now that we know all that… we know about the gorillas because we have gone through this big description. 

00:42:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:42:30
GAYLE DELANEY How else might you deal with this gorilla. But I won’t do that until the dreamers given me a full gorilla description, really got involved otherwise you get these happy endings oh I’ll turn the gorilla into a flower oh I’ll turn the gorilla into a good friend and he’ll just help me and give me a song and that doesn’t make for insight the gorilla has got some pain to tell you about. 

00:42:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:42:50
GAYLE DELANEY And so I try to get the dreamer connected to that. 

00:42:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:42:55
GAYLE DELANEY And then say how would you like to deal with the pain, rather than just white wash… 

00:43:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:43:00
GAYLE DELANEY …The gorilla. 

00:43:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Now I did bring a dream of… of mine and perhaps if I were to share that we could work with it and it would give our viewers an opportunity to see you at work and I think it will be perfectly appropriate Gayle for you to stop if you like and comment for… for the… the benefit of our viewers and just watch you are doing. 

00:43:15
GAYLE DELANEY Okay can I give a little structural background. 

00:43:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Sure. 

00:43:20
GAYLE DELANEY Okay what I’m going to do with you is I’m going to ask you to pretend I come from another planet. 

00:43:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:43:25
GAYLE DELANEY So I’ll ask you to describe all the major elements in your dream. 

00:43:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:43:25
GAYLE DELANEY And those elements are the setting, the people, the objects, the feelings and the actions. 

00:43:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:43:35
GAYLE DELANEY You can put animals in there as people if you want they are pretty close. 

00:43:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:43:40
GAYLE DELANEY And I’ll try to ask you about all those major images in the dream. 

00:43:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:43:40
GAYLE DELANEY Quotes in the dream, so and so said that’s an action. 

00:43:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Alright. 

00:43:45
GAYLE DELANEY So it depends how you want to cut up the pie, that’s how I cut it out. 

00:43:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:43:50
GAYLE DELANEY And then I will do three major things, I’ll ask you for very rich description and I’ll egg you on to tell me more about it, but I’m not asking you for your associations because that would take us 10 hours. 

00:44:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:44:00
GAYLE DELANEY But you give the associations anyway, but I’m going to and I want those but I’m not going to say I want those. 

00:44:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

00:44:05
GAYLE DELANEY I want you to give me a description to someone who comes from another planet nothing fancy just give me the basic facts and feelings about the image, how do you feel about it, what do you think about. 

00:44:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:44:15
GAYLE DELANEY Alright I want to know that. Then I use as best as I can remember your words not mine own words to recapitulate that description to you. So I got a good description now I recapitulate your own description. 

00:44:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:44:30
GAYLE DELANEY Because this is going to be the first time you have heard those words. 

00:44:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:44:30
GAYLE DELANEY Even though you’ve said them when it comes back to you it looks very different sound. 

00:44:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:44:35
GAYLE DELANEY And then I’ll say now is there anything in your life it could be a part of you, some situation in your life, someone else in your life. 

00:44:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:44:45
GAYLE DELANEY That comes to mind when I give you this description which you just gave me, that’s called bridging can you bridge from your dream, the dream image through the description to something in your life now I don’t want you to go look around your life and where does this fit because then these are force fit things. 

00:45:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:45:00
GAYLE DELANEY And if it’s doesn’t come right away that’s fine you just go later on and things have time to gel, but when you give me a good description and when I recapitulate it well to you usually an ideal world you’d say ah… you know that reminds me of such and such. 

00:45:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:45:15
GAYLE DELANEY And I’d say fine we have got a bridge, I might say now how does that fix because I want to make sure you're not just trying to please me or you didn’t go from just one or two qualities of the image you described and I want a pretty full sense. 

00:45:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:45:25
GAYLE DELANEY So its descriptions recapitulation bridge. 

00:45:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:45:30
GAYLE DELANEY Those are the three key steps of the interpretive method and that doesn't that means I try to keep my interpretations out of it. 

00:45:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right and I should say I feel a little bit vulnerable doing this on… on video it’s the dream is about a year old. I don’t know where we are going to go with this at some point if it feels like it’s getting to personal I’ll… I’ll just say I don’t want to go any further. 

00:45:50
GAYLE DELANEY And that’s perfect modeling for anybody listening. 

00:45:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:45:55
GAYLE DELANEY That when you work with a dream you have got to come with an open heart and the only way to be sure that you can do that and not protect yourself if any one of them are dooming(ph). 

00:46:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:46:00
GAYLE DELANEY You know unavoidably, is to say you know if it’s gets to a point where it’s too tender or too public in particular if you are in a public forum like this. Well thank you I think that’s all I will do right now, that’s fine that is just fine and I like everybody listen to you know that’s fine you don’t have to go one inch beyond your comfort zone. 

00:46:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:46:20
GAYLE DELANEY Unless you want to push yourself there. 

00:46:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:46:20
GAYLE DELANEY And I thinks it’s important for therapist listening not to push it, if the dreamer doesn’t want to… if the dreamer wants to be nudged, the dreamer can tell you okay this is really uncomfortable but if you would… wouldn’t mind nudging me a little bit I’m willing to do it. 

00:46:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:46:30
GAYLE DELANEY Okay. 

00:46:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:46:35
GAYLE DELANEY Great. Well why don’t you tell me your dream read it to me. 

00:46:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay the dream is about a year old I call it giant crocodile or is just the one I was going to do I guess it is, this is not the one we had selected, but it’s in my hand so. 

00:46:50
GAYLE DELANEY Would you like to do it or would you like to get the other one. 

00:46:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE No… no that’s all right. Let’s… let's just go with this who knows what will come up. 

00:46:55
GAYLE DELANEY Okay. 

00:46:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well it’s called giant crocodile it’s not a year old it’s about six months old. 

00:47:00
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

00:47:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I’m driving along the San Rafael canal when I see a large crocodile in the water its seems to be having no trouble getting enough food. Other people have seen it also I notice so I assume that authorities have been notified. Later as we continue to drive the terrain becomes more rugged there is a cliff above the canal then we see another crocodile much larger than the first. We are driving in a small VW Beetle someone in the car named Mark a tall handsome man gets out to have a closer look the crocodile is climbing up the cliff now we can see it as the whole length of the cliff at least 40 feet. Mark gets too close and the crocodile eats him. We see it swallow him whole, it is tragic and gruesome. 

00:47:50
GAYLE DELANEY Okay, so just to prepare you and our listeners when a dream ends up tragically and gruesomely it’s going to be something painful. 

00:48:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:48:00
GAYLE DELANEY You know we just can bet on that. Can I have the dream? 

00:48:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes… yes you can and I… I wonder if it’s useful to mention you know that note that I had written down there at the… at the time. 

00:48:10
GAYLE DELANEY Why don’t you, because people often make that sort of note after. 

00:48:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. I… I had just seen the movie JFK Oliver Stone’s film and I wondered at that time whether the crocodile represents either the conspiracy itself that he postulates to kill the president or the idea of a conspiracy theory that swallows people as they get close to it. 

00:48:30
GAYLE DELANEY Can I just ask you from that association you had remember what happened the day before that’s a trigger event. 

00:48:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

00:48:35
GAYLE DELANEY What, do you what know made you think about crocodile and conspiracy? 

00:48:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Crocodile conspiracy. 

00:48:40
GAYLE DELANEY You put it was having just seen JFK, I wonder if the crocodile represents either the conspiracy itself or the conspiracy theory that swallows people as they get close to it. 

00:48:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:48:55
GAYLE DELANEY There's something about the crocodile or that it swallows up or what was that. 

00:48:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well there… there's the sense about conspiracy theories that when people get involved in… in thinking about conspiracies they get fanatical, they get carried away or they become antagonistic and hostile to the notion that people can’t think rationally around the idea of conspiracy theory or if Oliver Stone’s particular hypothesis is correct you know the conspiracy is like this evil thing that you know kills anybody who gets wind of it and takes over the whole country. So. 

00:49:25
GAYLE DELANEY Okay, so you are telling me about the crocodile might be an evil thing that takes over and… 

00:49:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah the way in… in the dream it just jumped up suddenly and became an enormous much larger than you’d ever expect a real crocodile to be and just before this fellow had a chance to… to do anything it swallowed him whole. 

00:49:45
GAYLE DELANEY Okay alright so that’s we have been hearing about crocodiles so far from you. 

00:49:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:49:50
GAYLE DELANEY Since I come from another planet, I’ve never seen a croc. I don’t know a thing about how they work what they are like, I don’t know what San Rafael is, so I’m in the same boat as a lot of people who don’t live in California right, so I’m going to ask as we go along. 

00:50:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:50:00
GAYLE DELANEY Okay so pretend I come from another planet. 

00:50:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:50:05
GAYLE DELANEY And what's the San Rafael canal area like? 

00:50:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The San Rafael is a city where I happen to live. 

00:50:10
GAYLE DELANEY Okay that’s your hometown. 

00:50:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes, the canal is a body of water like a river only its man-made. 

00:50:15
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

00:50:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And it runs through the… through the town it has boats on it and ducks and… 

00:50:25
GAYLE DELANEY Do you like the canal not like the canal? I want to get your feelings as well as the fact. 

00:50:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah well I… I parts of it are nice, parts of it are very nice and… and. 

00:50:30
GAYLE DELANEY Why? 

00:50:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It’s pretty there can be you know sail boats, berthed and you get a sense of you know things reflecting half of the water and… 

00:50:40
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

00:50:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …parts of it are quite attractive and parts of it tend to look like an open sewer in places as well. 

00:50:50
GAYLE DELANEY And so where is the canal? 

00:50:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It… it runs very close to the downtown it sort of divides the city into two parts and one side is the very affluent area and the other side is… is an area that’s associated with immigrants and crime and… 

00:51:10
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

00:51:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …social problems. 

00:51:10
GAYLE DELANEY So do you like to go deriving around the canal area or not? 

00:51:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well I happen to I mean… in the course of… of living in San Rafael one drives by the canal frequently. 

00:51:20
GAYLE DELANEY Do you seek out the canal or do you go there to boat on it or anything like that? 

00:51:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Not usually. 

00:51:25
GAYLE DELANEY Okay so… so what you are telling me about a canal is the San Rafael canal is your hometown canal. 

00:51:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:51:30
GAYLE DELANEY It’s a divider between the affluent and the non-affluent and more crime oriented area. 

00:51:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:51:40
GAYLE DELANEY Right and it divides that, in places it looks like a sewer and in places it’s a nice for recreation for boating and that sort of thing. 

00:51:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes, yes. Hmm… hmm. 

00:51:50
GAYLE DELANEY Well so you’re driving along and you notice that there's a crocodile who has been able, no trouble getting enough food. 

00:51:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

00:51:55
GAYLE DELANEY You say, so what does tell us about the crocodile? 

00:51:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The crocodile is happy. 

00:52:00
GAYLE DELANEY We have happ… happy crocodile. 

00:52:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:52:00
GAYLE DELANEY What are crocodiles like? 

00:52:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well they are dangerous, crocodiles are… are… are dangerous and they… and they kill their prey and drown them and they have powerful jaws and they definitely not something that most people would want to get close to. 

00:52:20
GAYLE DELANEY Because they use their jaws to… 

00:52:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:52:25
GAYLE DELANEY …to get them. 

00:52:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

00:52:25
GAYLE DELANEY And to drown them, okay so it’s their jaws that make them dangerous? 

00:52:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:52:30
GAYLE DELANEY And they kill their prey, right now we have got a happy crocodile that hasn’t been caught by the authorities? 

00:52:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah right and it’s a reptile which is you know primitive more primitive form of life I think than… than the mammalian form and also I… I guess about reptiles I think that they don’t have the same emotional states that you know furry animals have. 

00:52:50
GAYLE DELANEY How is that different? 

00:52:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE They are ruthless, you know with a dog or a cat there's a sense you know warmth and relationship, not with a crocodile, although I did say it was happy I must. 

00:53:00
GAYLE DELANEY That’s alright it can be both. 

00:53:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. Yeah. 

00:53:05
GAYLE DELANEY So the… the dreamer is always right… right I mean… so it’s both this is a happy crocodile. Its having its needs met apparently, its getting its food but they are also ruthless and more primitive. 

00:53:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:53:15
GAYLE DELANEY And they have got these big jaws. 

00:53:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:53:15
GAYLE DELANEY Does this remind you and it may not at this point this is not a pressure question of anything in your life that’s like a crocodile that’s can be ruthless, they have big jaws very strong jaws. 

00:53:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:53:30
GAYLE DELANEY And they grab their prey eat them, I mean and they are more primitive, that’s… that’s what crocodiles do you don’t reason with or emotionally reason with them. 

00:53:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well of course in… in the light of having seen that movie it makes me think you know organizations can be like this. They are not human their… and… and governments or… or other hidden organizations perhaps more primitive. They… they seem more primitive when I see that organizations can sometimes take person’s life and destroy it and the person may not know what hit them. 

00:54:05
GAYLE DELANEY Okay is there are any organization in your life? 

00:54:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:54:05
GAYLE DELANEY That’s like a normal size crocodile. 

00:54:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:54:10
GAYLE DELANEY That’s right now on the dividing line of your own town. 

00:54:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE No. 

00:54:15
GAYLE DELANEY And you know the authorities need to be called because it is still a dangerous crocodile. 

00:54:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:54:20
GAYLE DELANEY But you don’t take particular action your assuming that somebody is already called the crocodile… 

00:54:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:54:25
GAYLE DELANEY Police. 

00:54:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:54:25
GAYLE DELANEY Right. 

00:54:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

00:54:25
GAYLE DELANEY So anything in your life that’s like a crocodile that’s been you know eating birds and such for the moment. 

00:54:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:54:30
GAYLE DELANEY But that could be very dangerous. Going to say no. 

00:54:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Actually, well no I can think of organizations that… that do that sure. 

00:54:40
GAYLE DELANEY Are there in your life because you’re the one who is in watching the situation. 

00:54:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Personally you mean. 

00:54:45
GAYLE DELANEY Yeah. 

00:54:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well when you say in my life it’s a kind of a funny. 

00:54:50
GAYLE DELANEY I try to leave it open so you pick it. 

00:54:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right, well okay where the first thing that is coming to me. 

00:54:50
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

00:54:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Are organizations like business and utilities that pollute, pollution is kind of like this. 

00:55:00
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

00:55:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Pollution can sneak up on people and… and cause great damage. 

00:55:05
GAYLE DELANEY What's happening so far in the dream is that crocodile isn’t causing great damage yet right. 

00:55:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:55:10
GAYLE DELANEY The crocodile is eating his prey. 

00:55:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

00:55:15
GAYLE DELANEY It’s not polluting this is not a polluting crocodile. Right. 

00:55:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well but this crocodile you know when I say its eating its prey its taking you know friendly little water fowl. 

00:55:25
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

00:55:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And… and killing them. 

00:55:25
GAYLE DELANEY Okay so the dreamer now… 

00:55:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:55:30
GAYLE DELANEY …is convincing me what he says does have a good strong relationship to the crocodile, so that was a testing question okay. 

00:55:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah… yeah. 

00:55:35
GAYLE DELANEY Alright that’s pretty interesting. 

00:55:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:55:35
GAYLE DELANEY We’ll just leave it now and go on to the next image. But then you see there's a big cliff above the canal. 

00:55:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

00:55:45
GAYLE DELANEY Do you want to tell me anything about how the cliff rises up? 

00:55:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well it… it… it starts out where there's no cliff. 

00:55:50
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

00:55:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And then as we are driving further along the cliff becomes gradual and gradual until it’s like about a 40 feet cliff above the canal, which in fact there isn’t. 

00:56:00
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

00:56:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In… in San Rafael this is my own. 

00:56:05
GAYLE DELANEY Dream geography. 

00:56:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah, although I used to live by a cliff. 

00:56:05
GAYLE DELANEY Did you? 

00:56:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes I lived in an area called Sea Cliff in San Francisco where there were cliffs like that. 

00:56:15
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

00:56:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Over the water and people would get killed, there were signs you know saying danger you were… you know be careful you might get swept away by the waves and people do. 

00:56:25
GAYLE DELANEY Okay so you are from an area that is flat by a canal. 

00:56:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:56:25
GAYLE DELANEY To a place it’s very dangerous, where people can be swept away. 

00:56:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

00:56:30
GAYLE DELANEY That’s what cliffs are like right. 

00:56:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:56:30
GAYLE DELANEY And rugged. 

00:56:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:56:30
GAYLE DELANEY Anything else, since I come from another planet I’ve got to know what… 

00:56:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:56:35
GAYLE DELANEY …cliffs do, so cliffs are dangerous and… 

00:56:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:56:35
GAYLE DELANEY Alright, so that’s what we are coming up to. 

00:56:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:56:40
GAYLE DELANEY That’s when you see another crocodile much larger than the first. 

00:56:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

00:56:45
GAYLE DELANEY And that’s also when you notice that you are driving in a small VW Beetle. 

00:56:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:56:50
GAYLE DELANEY Now what's a VW Beetle, I come from another planet we haven’t heard, but we have heard that they are popular on earth. 

00:56:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE They are cute. 

00:56:55
GAYLE DELANEY Yeah they are cute. 

00:56:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE They are… they are cute and they are old because they are not made now, when there… we… we would use the term funky to describe and this particular one in the dream was like that. It was sort of old beat up, but you get the feeling that people have a lot of fun in them. 

00:57:05
GAYLE DELANEY Ah that’s what funky he has to do, it’s sort of old beat up lots of fun. 

00:57:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:57:10
GAYLE DELANEY They were funkiest. 

00:57:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:57:10
GAYLE DELANEY Okay, there are certain adjectives you always get the dreamer to tell you about. 

00:57:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well right in this case yes. 

00:57:15
GAYLE DELANEY Alright. So this funky VW, the people would have fun in it. 

00:57:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:57:20
GAYLE DELANEY And they are cute. 

00:57:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:57:20
GAYLE DELANEY Alright, now what is the car in general, why do humans use cars? 

00:57:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE For transportation, it’s… it’s a mode of transportation. 

00:57:30
GAYLE DELANEY Okay is there any mode that you used to get from place to another in your life, that’s cute that is sort of funky and you know had some fun to it an old, old. 

00:57:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm. Let’s say. 

00:57:45
GAYLE DELANEY Not made anymore, so like a VW Beetle when you go around in and in the style of VW Beetle. 

00:57:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Actually I can’t think of anything like that. 

00:57:55
GAYLE DELANEY Okay that doesn’t seem like your style. 

00:57:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE No. 

00:57:55
GAYLE DELANEY Not at all. 

00:58:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Not… not. 

00:58:00
GAYLE DELANEY That’s fine, just say no. 

00:58:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know there was… you know at one time be… before we were married my wife had a… had a Beetle. 

00:58:05
GAYLE DELANEY Yeah. 

00:58:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE A… a car like that, Yes. 

00:58:05
GAYLE DELANEY And what was the feeling in being in that Beetle. 

00:58:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That particular one. 

00:58:10
GAYLE DELANEY Yeah. 

00:58:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I didn’t like it as a matter it had a little leak and you could smell gasoline and inside of it. 

00:58:20
GAYLE DELANEY So was that quite different from the feeling of the dream Beetle. 

00:58:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah it wasn’t the same, you know I had friends in the past you know this take goes back 10, 20 years. 

00:58:25
GAYLE DELANEY Yeah. 

00:58:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Where I have had friends I can had… I had a… I had a friend named Tommy who had an old Beetle just like that one. 

00:58:35
GAYLE DELANEY Yeah. 

00:58:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:58:35
GAYLE DELANEY Okay and what was the feeling when you go around in Tommy’s car. 

00:58:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well as a matter of fact this is very interesting Tommy was an artist and… and he used to do I don’t know what's the term happenings he… he would do unusual forms of art, he created a… a sculpture that he put on his old Beetle to make it look like a giant vagina, he called that is for vagina mobile, and… and he would go around doing sex education programs with this vagina mobile. 

00:59:05
GAYLE DELANEY Okay so this guy who… who had a VW Beetle.

00:59:50
GAYLE DELANEY And what was this Mark like. 

00:59:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well now here I’m a… I’m a… I’m a little delicate ground because I don’t remember the Mark in the dream too much but… but there was a person I… I knew… 

01:00:05
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

01:00:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …by that name a tall handsome fellow named Mark who was very charming, very friendly, artistic, a musician and also a drug user and a fellow who was violent.

GAYLE DELANEY Any aspect of that, but particularly rings a bell and if it doesn’t that’s fine. 

01:01:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE No it doesn’t but I’m getting an intuition that maybe this does represent some aspect of myself. 

01:01:10
GAYLE DELANEY What gives you that feeling? 

01:01:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm. It’s like a little voice. 

01:01:15
GAYLE DELANEY Okay and this little voice say to you oh that artistic side, that fun side or that violent and angry side or what does it say anything? 

01:01:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE A kind of selfishness maybe. 

01:01:30
GAYLE DELANEY Okay we'll just leave that here, we’ll come back to it. Let that little voice that often gathers speed you put that in the back burner. 

01:01:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

01:01:35
GAYLE DELANEY Okay, so you are in this VW and I’m repeating for purposes, and this is a funky car, that’s artsy car, they are not made anymore and just going along and that’s something you used to be more involved with back… 

01:01:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:01:45

JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah there was… there was a sense of adventure about him. 

01:02:25
GAYLE DELANEY Okay so was that also mirrored in the VW? 

01:02:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah… yeah you know that is the kind of car you would have an adventure in. 

01:02:30
GAYLE DELANEY Well I guess we have a character with you know two strong sides. 

01:02:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:02:35
GAYLE DELANEY Artistic, adventuresome, fun, selfish, vain and violent. 

01:02:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:02:40
GAYLE DELANEY That’s not uncommon don’t try to make a decision too early about it. 

01:02:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

01:02:45
GAYLE DELANEY Just let that be. 

01:02:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:02:45
GAYLE DELANEY So Mark gets out to take a closer look the crocodile… the crocodile this may be the same crocodile you see the crocodile is climbing up the cliff now. 

01:02:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah it’s the same crocodile. 

01:02:55
GAYLE DELANEY Ah, okay so what you thought was just a little something that somebody was going to take care of. 

01:03:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well no, no there… there were two crocodiles that I mentioned now there was a larger one. 

01:03:05
GAYLE DELANEY I’m sorry, okay so now we have got the second crocodile. 

01:03:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:03:05
GAYLE DELANEY And the facts in the dream are really important so I’m happy that I have your help. Now we see it is the whole length of the cliff at least 40 feet. 

01:03:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:03:15
GAYLE DELANEY Huge. 

01:03:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Huge. 

01:03:15
GAYLE DELANEY Anything else you can tell me about this crocodile? 

01:03:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well when you see the crocodile scampering up the side of the cliff you know you realize this is… this is a threat because we’re just down the other side ourselves and… and Mark is now standing on top of the cliff and there's a sense of… of surprise danger like this things is engulfing us… 

01:03:35
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

01:03:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …is about to you know and… and there is almost a horror. 

01:03:40
GAYLE DELANEY Can you give me anything of how the crocodiles, feeling the big crocodile, what's he feeling what's he up to? 

01:03:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE He is intent and I recall this like a feeling of a big belly there to and he wants to fill it. 

01:03:55
GAYLE DELANEY Does this remind you of anything in your life that’s like a really big crocodile there are the… 

01:04:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:04:00
GAYLE DELANEY …there are the… there the pollution crocodiles there are the things that eat in the canal. 

01:04:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:04:05
GAYLE DELANEY But there is a 40 foot crocodile that’s so big it’s got an empty belly and it wants to eat and one thing it's going to eat is this creative fun… 

01:04:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Oh yeah. 

01:04:15
GAYLE DELANEY …fun artistic.

01:04:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:04:15
GAYLE DELANEY And vain guy. 

01:04:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah now… now what's coming up is like my own… my own hunger, my own if I eating you know sometimes I get into almost like a… a mechanical or reptilian you know I’ll just eat things sometimes. 

01:04:35
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. Okay. 

01:04:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah you know. It’s my own eating, if its. 

01:04:35
GAYLE DELANEY So actual food eating. 

01:04:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:04:40
GAYLE DELANEY Alright, so it got actual food eating. 

01:04:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. Hmm… hmm. 

01:04:40
GAYLE DELANEY And I want to see if there's anything else there as well, because you had crocodile who you're concerned about as companies and organizations that do that. 

01:04:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right, right. 

01:04:50
GAYLE DELANEY This is even bigger than that. 

01:04:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:04:55
GAYLE DELANEY It has a relationship to the other crocodile and this is crocodile. 

01:04:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. Right. 

01:04:55
GAYLE DELANEY But this a 40 foot empty belly. 

01:05:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

01:05:00
GAYLE DELANEY And its going to eat up we know and you’ll feel very sad and its very gruesome. It’s going to Mark up. 

01:05:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. Right. 

01:05:05
GAYLE DELANEY And that’s sad you don’t say oh God I’m glad the world is rid of this vain, violent guy. 

01:05:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:05:10
GAYLE DELANEY Instead your sad how come. 

01:05:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. It’s a feeling of having witnessed there is a feeling you know if… if you were to see that happen in front of you, you’ll have a feeling like horror and that’s… that was the feeling tone in the dream. 

01:05:25
GAYLE DELANEY Why would you have horror I come from another planet why is that awful. 

01:05:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It’s the… the emotional shock of… and… and the loss. 

01:05:30
GAYLE DELANEY What loss what do you lose. 

01:05:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You lose. 

01:05:35
GAYLE DELANEY You are losing Mark, what are you losing? 

01:05:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well… well there was a person there we are relating, we’re having fun together and all the sudden he is gone. 

01:05:45
GAYLE DELANEY Okay, is there anything going on in your life around the time of the dream? 

01:05:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:05:50
GAYLE DELANEY May be for long time for 20 years well we know. Where there's some force in your life that eats up Mark. 

01:05:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:05:55
GAYLE DELANEY The fun, the artistic, the creative. 

01:06:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah well. 

01:06:00
GAYLE DELANEY That’s big belly and its… and its primitive it just goes and it eats. 

01:06:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm and it… well I think in a way when I eat a lot when I put on weight and now that I think about it that. I… I was heavy at that time that’s what I do to myself you know would like to the handsome fun loving part of myself I… I destroy it when I eat. 

01:06:20
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

01:06:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah, yeah and… and that’s real relevant for me now because my weight… I lost weight shortly after that dream and I’ve put it back on so. 

01:06:30
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

01:06:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah I can see where… where I do that to myself. 

01:06:30
GAYLE DELANEY Okay now people watching you might not see that you have any problem with being overweight and what we have to remind them… 

01:06:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Shall we give them a close up? 

01:06:40
GAYLE DELANEY Well we… we have to go remind is that how it feels for you with the forces. 

01:06:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:06:45
GAYLE DELANEY Now what are the forces that lead you to eat with that huge belly? 

01:06:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:06:45
GAYLE DELANEY You know that incredibly hungry, empty belly. 

01:06:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE This is… this is where I put on weight to when I eat, men do in general but I do definitely right there in the belly hmm… hmm. 

01:06:55
GAYLE DELANEY Okay and is it true as you just said I just want to get a confirmation if this is so. Does that go for the part of you that’s like Mark the tall, handsome; I’m not now emphasizing the negative because you don’t in the dream. 

01:07:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

01:07:10
GAYLE DELANEY In the dream you're emphasizing it’s just terrible thing to lose Mark, the fun loving the creative. 

01:07:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:07:15
GAYLE DELANEY Does that go when you into your eating mode. 

01:07:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah, even the vanity you know it's like… there's not much to be vain about. 

01:07:20
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

01:07:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. So may be there is some positive sight to that aspect of it, but in felt it’s… it's a horrible thing. 

01:07:30
GAYLE DELANEY So, there's nothing positive. Here's an example where I wouldn’t agree that ah… there's something good you are eating up you know the negative parts of Mark. 

01:07:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:07:35
GAYLE DELANEY If you’re feeling in the dream that has been gruesome. 

01:07:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

01:07:40
GAYLE DELANEY And tragic. 

01:07:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

01:07:40
GAYLE DELANEY That’s its lost. 

01:07:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

01:07:45
GAYLE DELANEY That’s what we have to look for. 

01:07:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

01:07:45
GAYLE DELANEY There's something tragic happening here. 

01:07:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right yeah. 

01:07:45
GAYLE DELANEY That’s been eaten up… 

01:07:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:07:50
GAYLE DELANEY Now what we can also look at in the dream is in the first part you notice a small crocodile. 

01:07:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:07:55
GAYLE DELANEY Things get worse next. 

01:07:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

01:07:55
GAYLE DELANEY Things got worse I think we can say from the structure of the dream because the authorities haven’t been notified. 

01:08:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:08:00
GAYLE DELANEY And you go by assuming that they have been notified. This is a part… may I now quote now that you say this sort of makes it funny. "I’m driving I see a large… large crocodile in the water it seems to be having no trouble getting enough food"aAnd you think well the authorities have been notified you know I've seen the weight and… 

01:08:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:08:20
GAYLE DELANEY …you know. 

01:08:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:08:25
GAYLE DELANEY But no there's a bigger one and this dream as you think about it over the next week or so. 

01:08:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:08:30
GAYLE DELANEY Might lead you to identify the… the state of mind you get into when you eat. 

01:08:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:08:35
GAYLE DELANEY Right. 

01:08:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know what another thought I just had is the… the… the 40 foot crocodile I wonder if that relates to turning 40 and you know the issues of… of. 

01:08:45
GAYLE DELANEY Are you turning 40? 

01:08:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Oh I’m well past 40 but… but the issues you know around weight since I’ve turned 40 I have been… I think more pronounced for me and… 

01:08:55
GAYLE DELANEY Okay. 

01:08:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …and the issue of losing you know that young, handsome part of myself yeah. 

01:09:00
GAYLE DELANEY Okay alright see how, what you're doing now is your feeling sort of the ripple effect of richer interpretations or understandings of the dream because its evoking more and more. 

01:09:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:09:10
GAYLE DELANEY And its confirming the general thrust of your understanding. 

01:09:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:09:15
GAYLE DELANEY You are not saying, yeah but you know now let's go see other way in which case we go back to ground one and say may be we haven’t looked at this. 

01:09:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:09:20
GAYLE DELANEY As clearly as we need to. 

01:09:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:09:25
GAYLE DELANEY But what you're saying now all fits within it and I wouldn’t be surprised during the week you have a much closer sense may be even what gave birth to some of the crocodile consciousness in you. 

01:09:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:09:35
GAYLE DELANEY Around eating. 

01:09:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:09:35
GAYLE DELANEY And some of the… the feeling states and it may be simply this is not a neurotic crocodile, this is that's what crocodiles do. 

01:09:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:09:40
GAYLE DELANEY And the… the problem is that the authorities haven’t been apparently notified in time. 

01:09:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah, well they sure didn’t know about the second one. 

01:09:50
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

01:09:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In any… but now I have this original concept when I had the dream that it was relevant to the concept of conspiracies and JFK and so you suggesting that may be my original interpretation was just off the mark. 

01:10:05
GAYLE DELANEY I would say that your first interpretation was shot from the hip. 

01:10:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:10:10
GAYLE DELANEY Because what you did and this is the problem with looking what's day residue. 

01:10:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:10:15
GAYLE DELANEY What did I do yesterday? 

01:10:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:10:15
GAYLE DELANEY That comes to mind now that I look in the dream. 

01:10:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:10:20
GAYLE DELANEY Yesterday’s events are triggers to the particular imagery you chose for you dreaming that night. 

01:10:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:10:25
GAYLE DELANEY There are two levels, that’s the imagery you saw JFK and we often, often dream about the novels we’ve been reading or the movies we’ve seen just before sleep. 

01:10:35
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

01:10:35
GAYLE DELANEY Kids do have more nightmares when they watch terrifying things before they go to sleep by the way for parents listening. 

01:10:40
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

01:10:40
GAYLE DELANEY Now the thing is you pick up on certain images because they fit you are emotional need for whatever your intending to dream about tonight. 

01:10:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:10:50
GAYLE DELANEY And you're not going to suddenly dream about something just because you saw JFK, but what you saw in JFK enlivened some stuff you have about crocodileness. 

01:11:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:11:00
GAYLE DELANEY Something that when you get close to it swallows you up. 

01:11:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:11:05
GAYLE DELANEY And you’ve got to be careful of it and you’ve got to get the authorities and get control over it and all of that stuff. So that fit there, but you use the imagery from your movies to your dreams of the day and you put them to our own use at night. So the big trick is not to take that as your whole interpretation. 

01:11:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:11:20
GAYLE DELANEY You take that and okay that reminded me… oh and it was useful because you had strong feelings about conspiracy. 

01:11:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:11:30
GAYLE DELANEY But as we worked with the dream those feeling were funneled or channeled off. 

01:11:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:11:30
GAYLE DELANEY Into another area that made more sense in the overall part of the dream and you weren’t telling me anymore about conspiracies. 

01:11:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:11:40
GAYLE DELANEY That would have been fine but that’s not what you did and that didn’t make sense in the dream context. 

01:11:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right now that makes a lot of sense for me to think now that this dream has do with eating and… and food issues, if you're swallowed the person whole and its. 

01:11:50
GAYLE DELANEY The handsome, slim. 

01:11:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know for a moment I thought, when I began to reflect about the VW bus… a Beetle being a… a vagina mobile and the crocodile 40 feet long it almost seemed like there was some sexual imagery like… you know but I think maybe that is stretching it, I don’t know that there is much there. 

01:12:10
GAYLE DELANEY That’s exactly that very important to find out when you are stretching it to make it mean something. The vagina mobile I heard use to say that’s an example how playful and fun VWs are and creative and youthful. 

01:12:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah-ah… hmm… hmm. 

01:12:25
GAYLE DELANEY Not that the VW was a vagina. 

01:12:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:12:25
GAYLE DELANEY And the crocodile didn’t put its nose in the… in the VW either. 

01:12:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:12:30
GAYLE DELANEY This guy gets out so it didn’t carry through that theme. 

01:12:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:12:35
GAYLE DELANEY But that association of the vagina mobile was very useful because it reminded you of something for funny and creative about VWs. 

01:12:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:12:45
GAYLE DELANEY This is what this guy do with his VW. 

01:12:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm and… and there was a sense you know of threat. 

01:12:45
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

01:12:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE There it’s like gosh it's like if you gobble everything up, if you become heavy and overweight and fat, you're going to lose that fun loving part. 

01:12:55
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. Okay now you're telling more corroborative. 

01:13:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:13:00
GAYLE DELANEY Material you say… oh yeah and more of this fits that way and more that’s the kind of feeling you're looking for… 

01:13:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:13:05
GAYLE DELANEY …not just one ah-ah, but other things start making sense. 

01:13:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well I could go on and on, now that we are getting into it about you know the serious issue of… of the weight is you know putting on getting becoming overweight and I. 

01:13:15
GAYLE DELANEY For you. 

01:13:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes for me. 

01:13:20
GAYLE DELANEY For you that’s really important issue. 

01:13:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It’s an issue. 

01:13:20
GAYLE DELANEY And that your dream tells me you take this as a matter of life and death at some level certainly to a creative. 

01:13:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:13:25
GAYLE DELANEY And funky and playful part of you which is tragic, you tell me it's gruesome, you tell me it's tragic. 

01:13:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:13:30
GAYLE DELANEY And its real loss. 

01:13:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:13:35
GAYLE DELANEY And that’s my world. 

01:13:35
GAYLE DELANEY That I follow that. 

01:13:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

01:13:35
GAYLE DELANEY Definition of… 

01:13:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:13:35
GAYLE DELANEY …of reality about your weight, I've even though I look at you I don’t say this guy is overweight. 

01:13:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE People say that to me all the time and it bothers me because I know I’ve got an issue. 

01:13:45
GAYLE DELANEY That’s right you got the issue the dream makes it really very clear that you do. 

01:13:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah… yeah. So what you’re saying now is that we have these… these intersecting lines where this interpretation is like the correct interpretation. 

01:14:00
GAYLE DELANEY Now might be the next you going to call me up Gayle you know what I was in the office I was talking about my weight. 

01:14:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:14:05
GAYLE DELANEY But then I remembered that when I was little my father wanted to devour me. 

01:14:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:14:15
GAYLE DELANEY And that might make as much sense to you and work into how you devour things. 

01:14:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:14:20
GAYLE DELANEY So there might be another level of I’m not saying there is any or even that I suspected but that would be the case, if you came back to me a week later and said you know what Gayle this wasn’t that, what that dream really was about I’ve decided it was about my concern for conspiracy issues. 

01:14:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:14:35
GAYLE DELANEY And then I think ah-ah, he’s covering over the tender parts and he is going back to something very distance, saying you know this is just out there. Sometimes people will say that. Once I had a ongoing dream study group with therapist. 

01:14:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:14:50
GAYLE DELANEY And about sixth weekend I was trying too hard to stay awake. Usually dreams are so exciting you can’t fall asleep. I did caffeine things I never do to stay awake with this group it was so boring and it’s about their fifth or sixth session I said no I looked over the dreams we’ve worked on here and funny they are all about work, lets on the odds it's pretty unlikely that they are all about work, whether something going on here that because I’ve had trouble staying awake and the photo therapist who had were friend together "oh well that’s what we decided how we are going to talk about the session we don’t want to do our personal issues here we’re coming because we want to be better therapist working with other people’s dreams, but with their own dreams but we only pick dreams that were deal with work." So I said lets pick anyone of those dreams we have to open this up because who knows what's going to go and it’s not uncommon for someone who is quite defensive or deciding they don’t want to be open. 

01:15:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:15:40
GAYLE DELANEY To associate to work issues but not in our life issues. 

01:15:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:15:45
GAYLE DELANEY Sometimes they are work issues, but in this case these women were bringing in core issues. One had an abuse issue, she turned into… this reminds you something at work my office… my… my boss is mean to me. 

01:15:55
Hmm… hmm. 

01:15:55
GAYLE DELANEY But there was a very defensive moving away, very different from how you worked you would be open up and you just see what's comes up rather than say alright I'll look into this area of my life and so if we might work with work and I have to follow the dreamer. 

01:16:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:16:05
GAYLE DELANEY I don’t think I can say you're lying. 

01:16:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well I… I have to say you know with regard to this dream I don’t know idea when we started that it was going to go in this direction. 

01:16:15
GAYLE DELANEY Neither did I and that’s what makes dream work so much fun. 

01:16:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah-ah. When people are kind of covering up and not willing to get into the real issue and you notice yourself getting tired that’s a clue. 

01:16:25
GAYLE DELANEY That’s a clue or if you feel like you're having like sissified keep climbing up the same hill and you get pushed down and you know it doesn’t remind me of anything and the question of does this remind you of anything in your life. 

01:16:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:16:35
GAYLE DELANEY The no comes before the looking then you know you have to ask the dreamer well you know I can’t find this one for you, you have to wait a minute look inside see what it reminds you, there's a little voice somewhere and its going to tell you if you just give me more description. 

01:16:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:16:50
GAYLE DELANEY But if you rather stop working on it that’s okay but I can’t do this. 

01:16:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah, let me ask you this can we go further with this I feel like I’m still left with this crocodile. 

01:17:00
GAYLE DELANEY Do you want to go, do more. 

01:17:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well I don’t know. I… I where do you go with a… with a crocodile like… like this? You know how… 

01:17:10
GAYLE DELANEY What are you left with tell me what you left with. 

01:17:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I’m left with this feeling, because when I had the dream I was very near my all time high weight and I did you know I think the dream did must have stirred something up because I lost weight then I took off 10 pounds and now here we are back some… some five, six months later and I see I’ve put it back on again so this is a… this dream. 

01:17:35
GAYLE DELANEY And you accidently chose that dream. 

01:17:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I accidently chose this dream it wasn’t even the one that we had intended. 

01:17:40
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

01:17:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE To… to go into, so now I’m saying what… what will I do I don’t, I get the impression they are trying to call the police and that is putting myself on a strict regiment is not the way to do it. I have to work with the crocodiles somehow. 

01:17:50
GAYLE DELANEY Well that may have be or may not be true. 

01:17:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:17:55
GAYLE DELANEY Oaky let’s look at what this much of the dream says. Remember this dream came when you had put on all the weight. 

01:18:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:18:00
GAYLE DELANEY And see you know through heaven knows what levels of insight. 

01:18:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:18:05
GAYLE DELANEY Either from the dream that were unconscious or other life issues in your scale. 

01:18:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:18:10
GAYLE DELANEY You have lost the weight. 

01:18:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:18:10
GAYLE DELANEY The dream says right now you’ve got this big dangerous crocodile that is devouring or threatening to devour your Mark that’s playful and creative. 

01:18:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:18:20
GAYLE DELANEY There's also this other one that the authorities haven't been called on. 

01:18:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:18:25
GAYLE DELANEY Okay if you go back into the dream what do you think needs to be done in the first part of the dream when you notice the crocodile if you had that dream to do again. 

01:18:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:18:35
GAYLE DELANEY What do you think will be the ideal response for you to have? 

01:18:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The… the very first time. 

01:18:40
GAYLE DELANEY The very first sighting of the… the smaller crocodile that’s still large in the canal. 

01:18:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah… yeah. 

01:18:45
GAYLE DELANEY That’s getting plenty to eat. 

01:18:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Call the authorities. 

01:18:45
GAYLE DELANEY Is that in the reality of the dream is it good to assume there's authorities has been called or should you call what do you think? 

01:18:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well I that’s a… that’s a tricky question and in this case there's a lot of people around and were an effort to call, they were an effort may be to get some kind of specialist in who can you know take care of this crocodile check and see if it has got a big cousin, a family. 

01:19:10
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

01:19:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Around. 

01:19:10
GAYLE DELANEY Okay. 

01:19:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Something should be done yeah. 

01:19:15
GAYLE DELANEY It is a tricky question. 

01:19:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:19:15
GAYLE DELANEY And we keep looking for the straight forward answers. 

01:19:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Alright. 

01:19:20
GAYLE DELANEY But with the weight problem obviously there are lots of ways to deal with it. 

01:19:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:19:25
GAYLE DELANEY All right so one thing you might do is call in a specialist who knows how to deal with crocodiles. 

01:19:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:19:30
GAYLE DELANEY And one thing we have to remember about the crocodiles there so much you really think about… 

01:19:30
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

01:19:30
GAYLE DELANEY …is they are primitive. 

01:19:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:19:30
GAYLE DELANEY And they think about eating. 

01:19:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:19:35
GAYLE DELANEY They are not more realistic about it. 

01:19:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That’s right. 

01:19:35
GAYLE DELANEY They see food they eat, they can move very fast and devour. 

01:19:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

01:19:40
H But if you are not careful they will also devour something you left. 

01:19:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Practically their whole life. 

01:19:45
GAYLE DELANEY Okay. 

01:19:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:19:45
GAYLE DELANEY So you get to know the personality of a crocodile a little better. 

01:19:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. Yeah. 

01:19:50
GAYLE DELANEY That’s something you can do on your own, you can also do that with somebody who knows how to deal with crocodiles. 

01:19:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:19:55
GAYLE DELANEY You know weight specialist, people who deal with people with eating. 

01:19:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah… yeah. 

01:19:55
GAYLE DELANEY Stuff. 

01:20:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

01:20:00
GAYLE DELANEY And you may have set yourself for 10 pounds I don’t have to see a specialist may be you do. 

01:20:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:20:05
GAYLE DELANEY May be it will be helpful for you to really sit down and talk about weight. 

01:20:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:20:10
GAYLE DELANEY You know very straight forward way stuff. 

01:20:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:20:10
GAYLE DELANEY With the hungry crocodile type. 

01:20:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:20:10
GAYLE DELANEY It may be enough for you to think about crocodile personalities. 

01:20:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:20:15
GAYLE DELANEY And animals are wonderful you’ll have more dreams of… of the same thing as we working on it. 

01:20:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:20:20
GAYLE DELANEY And look at the person… what is a crocodile what is the personality of a crocodile and that tells you a lot. Get to know the crocodile when you go let’s say tomorrow evening or dinner time you’re a little hungry. See if the crocodile is leavening you to eat and what do you want to do about, do you want to call in the authorities, the authority you. No… no we’re not going to have crocodiles here that’s not the way I’m going to eat now. 

01:20:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:20:45
GAYLE DELANEY Or you may want to be in a weight program were people talk about this stuff and get used to it. 

01:20:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah… yeah. 

01:20:45
GAYLE DELANEY Does that make sense. 

01:20:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words what your saying is I’ve got lots of options here but I’ve got to address the issue. 

01:20:55
GAYLE DELANEY Really have to address the issue, because you don’t want to lose Mark that would be tragic for you. 

01:21:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. Right. 

01:21:00
GAYLE DELANEY And I think the dreams, bitter sweet messages you know you could save Mark. 

01:21:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:21:05
GAYLE DELANEY But not if the crocodile isn’t dealt with. 

01:21:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:21:10
GAYLE DELANEY And it’s so important for you. 

01:21:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. Thank you Gayle. Thank you… 

01:21:15
GAYLE DELANEY Thank you Jeffrey. 

01:21:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I'm… I appreciate it that was… that was a valuable… a valuable session for me. Now we got a little less than five minutes left so may be this would be a good time to recapitulate. 

01:21:25
GAYLE DELANEY Hmm… hmm. 

01:21:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Since what we are really talking about is not my crocodile but about your dream methods so first we could talk a little bit now about what you’ve just done. 

01:21:35
GAYLE DELANEY Okay, you were very cooperative and remembering that I come from another planet. 

01:21:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:21:40
GAYLE DELANEY So then you told me about San Rafael and the canal and you gave me descriptions of the place. 

01:21:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:21:45
GAYLE DELANEY Right what's the place like, what does it feel like to you, I get good descriptions and I think that we could do more with that the particular place you found but then again when were else would you find a crocodile but in the canal and on a cliff a very dangerous place and let’s not forget this is all coming to mind to, that Mark was on a cliff. 

01:22:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:22:05
GAYLE DELANEY A very precipitous and dangerous place for you. 

01:22:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:22:05
GAYLE DELANEY So what we did is got from you very simple descriptions, these weren’t hard descriptions for you to give. 

01:22:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

01:22:10
GAYLE DELANEY You didn’t have to be embarrassed about them, you just tell them. 

01:22:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:22:15
GAYLE DELANEY To someone who comes from another planet or to a child it makes easy. 

01:22:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:22:15
GAYLE DELANEY Alright, so just sitting up that… that… that standard your describing to someone from another planet is the key thing. Then if you’re doing this on own you write down this descriptions and then you read them back to yourself if you have friend which makes it easier you recapitulate those descriptions trying to use only dreamers words. 

01:22:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:22:35
GAYLE DELANEY Viding your life as like crocodile, which you said was da, da, da. 

01:22:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:22:40
GAYLE DELANEY And as I’m doing that you have time to rest, listen that it wash over you and all of a sudden thoughts that are very surprising come to mind. 

01:22:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:22:50
GAYLE DELANEY And you say you know I want to bridge that this reminds me of such and such in my life. 

01:22:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:22:55
GAYLE DELANEY And then I test that bridge. 

01:22:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:22:55
GAYLE DELANEY I say well how is it like that or is it really like that and if it’s a strong bridge you are not saying this to please me or get out of the difficulty you've not knowing an answer. 

01:23:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:23:05
GAYLE DELANEY And you say well yes this is this way and further more it’s also similar in this way. 

01:23:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:23:10
GAYLE DELANEY And that happened with the crocodile the big one and the small one and with Mark and with the VW. 

01:23:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:23:15
GAYLE DELANEY And then the associations like the vagina mobile. 

01:23:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:23:15
GAYLE DELANEY That aren’t central you don’t have to go off on a to a sexual imagery about it. 

01:23:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

01:23:20
GAYLE DELANEY Because the thrust for you was at the playfulness and I don’t come in and say ah-ah we have a sexual image. I keep that stuff out of way and see if it comes up again and again or if you seem to be… 

01:23:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And it was a secondary association it wasn’t in my dream. 

01:23:35
GAYLE DELANEY Exactly and I’m in no position as far I thought he was. To tell you what you've really meant and that the very part secondary atrocious is really most important, I don’t think so. Most of the time the dreamer really tells you what's important first off you can tell by the tone of voice, as people want to replay this tape. 

01:23:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:23:50
GAYLE DELANEY Watch the tone of voice that Jeff… that Jeffrey had when he was talking about the hunger and now came up with a tummy stuff and you see oh that’s convincing. 

01:24:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:24:00
GAYLE DELANEY It's gets convincing. 

01:24:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:24:00
GAYLE DELANEY So that’s what we are doing, get a description recapitulation bridge those are the key steps, follow the dreamers lead if you think the dreamer is avoiding something bring the dreamer over and say how about looking at that but don’t push and eventually the dreamer will lead you usually to a nice strong thrust of what the dream is about and then we will want to stop talking about because it even makes more sense. 

01:24:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:24:20
GAYLE DELANEY As it goes on. 

01:24:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah… yeah. ah-ah. 

01:24:25
GAYLE DELANEY And the best work you do with the dream is after you’ve gotten an interpretation think about it for a week run yourself through the images. 

01:24:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

01:24:30
GAYLE DELANEY And then see if you want to do about your life. 

01:24:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. So what… you know at this point I need to sort of sit with this and mull it over and just. 

01:24:40
GAYLE DELANEY And get to know that crocodile well. 

01:24:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Get to know that crocodile. Okay… okay well Gayle this has been a real more than pleasure, it’s been a rewarding experience for me. You help me get… get in touch with an issue that I have been in a little bit of denial about. So… so I appreciate it and… and it’s been an honor to see you at work doing… doing what you do so well. 

01:25:05
GAYLE DELANEY Oh! Thank you Jeffrey it was great to work with you. 

01:25:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm thanks for being with me. 

01:25:10
GAYLE DELANEY My pleasure. 

01:25:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And thank you for being with us.
