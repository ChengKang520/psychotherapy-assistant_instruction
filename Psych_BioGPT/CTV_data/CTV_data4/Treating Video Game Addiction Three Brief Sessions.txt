ALEXANDER STREET PRESS HAWAII ACA2014 Conference & Expo ACA Counseling in Action Demonstration Series Treating Video Game Addiction: Three Brief Sessions Brian Van Brunt 

00:00:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT My name is, ah, Brian Van Brunt and I'll be, uhm, playing the part of therapist today doing some addictions treatment with, ah, Katie(ph), uhm, my gracious graduate student, uhm, who's volunteered for this, ah, for this project. So, that's her plan today. What we're gonna do today is a three to 10-minute sessions, uhm, just very brief kind of snapshots in time. My general experience, I've been working college counseling for about 20 years or so, uhm, a LPC therapist. I started my doctorate in, ah, Counseling Education and Supervision. I trained therapists and psychologists and I've done that for most of my career. Now, I've moved over to the evil side of consulting. Uhm, some over with a grip called NCHERM, the National Center for Higher Ed. Risk Management. And I do trainings on threat assessment primarily suicide and, uhm, therapeutic interventions with college students. So that's kinda were my background is coming from. And during that time, I've done a lot of work in addictions with college students. I know this might be surprising but, occasionally, college students, uhm, drink a little more than us supposed to. Uhm, that's a joke. I know you can put it out. I know. It's just-- maybe it's just the schools I worked out, but occasionally they do that, uhm, or using drugs or other substances. So, uhm, I've often been in a role of working with those students, working with the court student forensic evaluations and, uhm, you know, and DUIs, the intoxicated and bad decision-making. I guess that's a whole, uhm, quality as well. And, certainly, with our other addictive qualities whether it's studying, relationships, uhm, or even video game addiction, I worked with a lot of clients in those areas as well. Uhm, I'm excited for this program because it, it goes away from the traditional thing that maybe you were expecting which would be kind of a slacker, with like a backwards hat, like crazy, like, "Yeah, I called you the other time and it's awesome. And I just, I just-- I lose track like, world, World of Warcraft for like 12 hours a day, you know, like an eight level paladin mage or-- right? That's probably what you're expecting. And, ah, this is gonna be a little different. We have, uhm, a female, uhm, patient and the Candy Crush is the problem. So, a little, little bit of a switch and, and maybe that hits a little closer to home to some of you here. You thought you're safe, right? No, no, it's good. I don't, I don't have an Xbox, so I'm gonna be fine." Uhm, but that's the thing with addiction. It can, uhm, it can sneak up on you. So, let me give you just a real quick overview of the, the plans today. 

00:02:30
Session One • Establish rapport • Chief complaint • Disruption of family, friends, work, school • Previous attempts at limiting and control • Identifying triggering events • Family history; additional addictive qualities • Establishment of goal • Baseline the behavior • Harm reduction versus abstinence 

00:02:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT The first session in about 10 minutes, my hope is to, uhm, go over to some of these basic ideas. Establishing rapport with the client, get building a connection, getting a, a sense of the chief complaint. Let's assume for argument sake and time sake that we've actually done an informed consent. I've gone over some of the basic information with her. And even, uhm, in this, ah, area, Titanium is a program that's use quite frequently in counseling centers. We've already completed it. In intake form, they've described for me some of the problems. So, I have that in my head as we're beginning just an overview of the problem. Uhm, so establishing some goals. I'm gonna search around a little bit maybe broach the subject of a harm reduction versus abstinence. That would be our theme throughout this, uhm, talk as well in threat or treatment deciding if this is something that needs to be reduced that we need to look cognitively at her behaving differently, or if this is something that she really can't touch anymore and need to step away from. And that, that theory will be played out. 

00:03:25
Session Four • Continue rapport building, overall check in • Update on current behavior • What worked? What didn't? • Support, reassurance, encouragement • Change Theory • precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance and relapse prevention • Motivational Interviewing techniques • Expressing empathy, avoiding argumentation, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance, supporting self efficacy • Re establish updated plan 

00:03:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT The we're going to, uhm, more space and time and move to Session Four kind of in the middle somewhere. In our discussion, I'll shift a little bit more towards, uhm, what worked and what didn't. Uhm, so we've been working together for about four weeks now. She's had some success and some failure. I wanna talk about these kind of things and, ah, then try to reestablish the plan. I'll use some change theory, concepts of time or time allowance. I think that's really interesting concept to introduce to clients to talk about that kind of two steps forward, one step back normalizing things, helping them to understand that recovery is a process not something happens overnight. 

00:04:05
Session 8 • Update on current behavior • Support positive change • Identify future obstacles and triggers • Build positive social support • Harm reduction vs. abstinence • Future counseling check in • "How will you know if the behavior gets out of control again?" • Termination and future contact information 

00:04:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT And then, finally, on the last session is really a termination session, uhm, kind of where do we go from here, what worked, what didn't as we move forward. So, try to do that 10-minute sessions all the way through. Questions or things I can answer for you. Yes 

00:04:20
 I would like to know why Mrs. Blank came in counseling and, ah, came in counseling and, ah, you know, how, how she came to recognized that she had a problem in any intervention? 

00:04:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT I love it. So, the question is why did my client come to counseling and why did she have, uhm, -- why did feel like she needed to, uhm, come in. Let's find out. 

00:04:35
 Oh, okay. 

00:04:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Katie(ph), hi, I'm Bryan. 

00:04:40
KATIE Hi. Nice to meet you. 

00:04:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, nice to meet you. Tell me a little bit why, uhm, you're coming in today. What can I do to help? 

00:04:45
KATIE Uhm, I just feel like I always have my hand on my-- on my pho-- my phone in my hand and I'm like looking at Candy Crush and waiting for my lives recharge. And then, I just feel like I'm attached to it way too much. 

00:05:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:05:00
KATIE And I wanna get away from that. I, I don't think that that's a good way for me to be. 

00:05:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. How long have you feeling this way? How long this is going on for you? 

00:05:10
KATIE Since about Christmas. 

00:05:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:05:10
KATIE Yeah. Couple of months. 

00:05:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT So, couple of months now. 

00:05:15
KATIE Yeah. 

00:05:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Is that the first time you played Candy Crush? 

00:05:15
KATIE Yeah. I actually started, you know, around the holidays cuz you know, being a student, like, I'm used to go, go, go, go, go. And, like, around the holidays had so much time, I didn't know what to do with myself and my boyfriend has been a Candy Crusher for, like, a long time. And he's like, "Here, play this." And, you know, at first I was just like, "No, I'll just watch you," and then I was like, "Hey, I'm gonna download it to my phone." And ever since then I just feel like I'd been so attached to my phone. 

00:05:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:05:45
KATIE I hate it. 

00:05:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Is that the name for Candy Crush players, Candy Crushers. They have it. 

00:05:50
KATIE Yeah. I mean, that's what I-- yeah, we're Candy Crushers. 

00:05:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. What's a, a typical day look like for you when you're, when you're playing? I know it's kinda hard to average out, like, exactly. I'm sure each day is a little different, but what did it talk about? 

00:06:05
KATIE No, it's kind of like a routine. Uhm, it's, like, I get up in the morning and that's the first thing I do is grab phone and I mean, it, it's right by the bed and I look you know-- and, uhm, go on and start playing immediately. You know, it's like drinking coffee in the morning. And, you know, I'll get ready and maybe play another round and, uhm, -- yeah, hopefully, make it to school or work on time. And then just-- as I started feeling, I don't know, like I need to get away throughout the day - 

00:06:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:06:35
KATIE - like a break or, uhm, if I'm idle like on the bus to his class, you know, I'll play that. And then, uhm, you know, it just depends on what stage I'm in. So, if, you know, I'm beating levels pretty well I will, you know, get excited and want to keep going. If I'm feeling frustrated, I'll be able to like put it away. But then I'll think about like what could I have done differently or ask my boyfriend for strategies. He's really good at it, like - 

00:07:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:07:05
KATIE - he's so far along. Uhm, yeah, so which is throughout the day. And then, when I get home, like, we're playing while we're eating an not really even talking to each other. And then, before bed, like we're sitting up in bed and most people read a book or talk about something or watch TV, we were on our phones candy crushing. And, you know... 

00:07:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. It so-- it sounds like it's something that you guys share together as well, so there's - 

00:07:30
KATIE Yeah. 

00:07:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - a positive aspects of it that you kinda get from it? 

00:07:30
KATIE Uhm, I'd like to say yes but it's, it's so weird like it's like as if I was sitting next on somebody on the bus and - 

00:07:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:07:40
KATIE - they're playing too. It's like no connection in between. And, like, you just get so engrain and, it like, you don't even realize there's a world going on around you. 

00:07:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm, so it maybe started off a little differently that you, you enjoyed it and can't put it down and can't let it go. And then, from here, and you're right kinda built over time and maybe gets a little more a lot of control now for you. 

00:08:00
KATIE Yeah. It was enjoyable when like we were connecting cuz he was showing me what to do - 

00:08:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:08:00
KATIE - and, and telling me about, like, the different little candies and what they could do. And, you know, I, I was excited to learn from him. And now, I mean, I'm almost as far long as, you know, he was when we first started playing. So, I've learned enough up to that point, and, you know, and getting in myself. So, now we don't really even communicate back and forth about it, you know, except like what level you're on and he's always ahead of me. So, I don't know. 

00:08:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT It's become a bit of a race between you two - 

00:08:30
KATIE Yeah. 

00:08:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - try to catch up. 

00:08:30
KATIE It's a little competition but he's so good. I can't even like compete with him. 

00:08:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:08:30
KATIE But even like when we go to family members' houses, he wants to be on their iPod and play their Candy Crush. Like his mom, like, she just, uhm, plays, you know, every once in a while and he'll get on there and help her beat levels and help her advance. 

00:08:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:08:45
KATIE And, you know, and I'll, I'll say, "Well, I wanna do that, too." So, then, you know, other family members let us played in their phones cuz we do it all the time. We're so good at it. 

00:08:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT I'm guessing you've tried to stop before coming into counseling. Uhm, and - 

00:09:00
KATIE Yeah. 

00:09:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - what-- what's been your success in terms of cutting back and-- I mean, does that work or not so much? 

00:09:05
KATIE Well, I tried to like to leave my phone places like at home or in the car. Uhm, and then I get like those anxiety like I'm gonna miss something like a new mail or phone call or a text message. And - 

00:09:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:09:20
KATIE - so, like, that's not working for me cuz I want to be near my phone. 

00:09:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:09:25
KATIE You know, but that's what the game it. 

00:09:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT It reminds me a little bit of other people have described with like eating disorders or with like addiction to alcohol that sometimes the social impact other - 

00:09:35
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:09:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - that it's, it's in their mind. They wanna just separate from it and say, "I'm just gonna do this," but then you know, they find themselves at a restaurant or they find themselves out with friends and their goals get messed up. So, for you, it sounds like, you know, you, you wish you can almost take that Candy Crush part out of the phone and kind of leave it and still have access to your e-mails and things. But-- since it's all together, it makes it harder to - 

00:09:55
KATIE Right. 

00:09:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - balance that. 

00:09:55
KATIE Yeah. My boyfriend has even tried like having an old phone - 

00:10:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:10:00
KATIE - and not his phone that he normally uses and then he found it like, "I don't like it here on two phones." So, you know. 

00:10:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. So, he's tried to cut back too and he's a... 

00:10:10
KATIE Yeah. 

00:10:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, what makes it a, a larger problem in your mind? Where does it started to get in a way of what-- I mean, it sound that there's a communication stop between you and your boyfriend. 

00:10:20
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:10:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT You're in the same space but not really talking. Ah, with work or school sounds like you've maybe been a little late to things occasionally or... 

00:10:25
KATIE Yeah. I mean, I definitely missed my bus stop more than couple of times - 

00:10:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:10:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - going to class. Like, it really is like the world disappears. I mean, and that's something I like about it cuz, you know, cuz I, I work full-time. I go to school full-time. There's just a lot of going on in my world. Sometimes I just need a way. 

00:10:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:10:40
KATIE So, when I do that, I just don't-- I feel like I lose control over time and-- or lose track of time and control over where I need to be. And, yeah, I just don't like that. 

00:10:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. If you had-- you know, this is that miracle question that I'm sure in your counseling program referred about before what, what would you like to see, uhm, in terms of if you had control over this and you could see yourself, you know, a month or two from now? Where, where would you wanna be with, with your behavior? 

00:11:10
KATIE It's really hard. Uhm, I wanna say I don't want Candy Crush to me and my boyfriend run my life, uhm, but I really don't think that's realistic. Uhm, I don't know, maybe that I just allow myself to do it in the morning, going to bed, and only after a certain time at night cuz I, I wanna connect with my boyfriend - 

00:11:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:11:35
KATIE - when I-- when we're off the work and, you know, wrapping up our date together. And then I think it's okay to do in bed like when you're trying to fall asleep, you know. 

00:11:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Maybe how it started out for you, right, like that idea of just seeing that as a, a rest bed or break from things, kinda breaking it into this zone and enjoy it but not to feel like it expands beyond that. 

00:11:50
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:11:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:11:55
KATIE Yeah. 

00:11:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT It make sense. Ah, well, what I, what I like you to do, you know, after we've talked a little bit today, uhm, when I'm-- I, I began kind of process with people to change behavior, uhm, the first thing I'd like you to do is I think is really easy. Uhm, so if you came in here anxious about, "Oh, no! This is gonna be really hard," your first week is really easy. And what I'd like you to do is, if you have a journal or, uhm, maybe even on your phone if you have like a notepad - 

00:12:20
KATIE Hmm. 

00:12:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - ah, where I can certainly a form that you can kinda check off, I'd like you to just track, uhm, your use warming(ph) for the first week. Uhm, write down whenever you play. Ah, maybe if you're out, if you're out for it, if there's someone who can, uhm, get behind kind of journaling and writing about what you're doing. You can even talk about maybe some of the emotions or feelings at that time. 

00:12:35
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:12:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT And for the first week, just gonna keep track of, uhm, how often you are playing and, and how you feel when you do it. Uhm, and there's the easy part. I don't want you to change your behavior at all. 

00:12:45
KATIE Okay. 

00:12:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT I want you to, you know, don't worry about limiting. Don't worry, I want you to just kinda do what you've been doing but just write it down this time. Uhm, it will kinda do that then meet again next week and talk from there. Does that sound okay? 

00:12:55
KATIE Yes. 

00:12:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:12:55
KATIE I can do that. 

00:13:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. Let's do that. Uhm, so we'll pause here. This will be, you know, basically the first session. Uhm, we'd probably spent a little bit more time exploring other addictive qualities. I might ask some questions about alcohol and other substances. I get into a larger discussion of family addiction history and maybe a little talk if I could get into around social support, friends, people who might have been involved in this with her who would be you know, fellow, fellow Candy Crushers who might inspire her more to play versus people who would, uhm, push back a little bit on that. So, let's assume we've been meeting. Kay(ph) and I have been talking for a couple of weeks now. It's about, you know, four weeks later and we're gonna talk about what's , what hasn't work. She's baseline to behavior for me. Uhm, we're at about 68 hours a day that she's playing which is pretty extreme. Uhm, she hasn't play straight, but she's playing at times like she said and mentioned at the bus stop, just eating up time, before bed, waking up, or she's eating breakfast that something that happens with other activities but it's pretty significant. Uhm, so we've done some things about trying to have her cut back. We've talked about having her leave the phone in places, uhm, turning it off. We've talked about, uhm, -- we've broached the subject of taking it off the phone. She's not been ready to do that yet. Uhm, but the idea of, you know, how point trying to cut back on this behavior. And we're gonna meet again, ah, about four sessions. And so, Katie(ph), thanks for coming back in today. Uhm, how has it been? How have you been doing? 

00:14:25
KATIE Well, like I've been doing a lot of writing. 

00:14:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:14:30
KATIE Uhm, the writing it down has definitely brought to my awareness how much I do it. And, like the emotions I am feeling when I do it. 

00:14:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uh-hmm. 

00:14:40
KATIE Like, main emotion is like overwhelmed. So, when-- and what the funny thing is when I'm feeling overwhelmed in my life and I go to Candy Crush to kind of get away from it all. And I put down Candy Crush it's usually cuz I'm feeling overwhelmed by Candy Crush. 

00:15:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uh-hmm. 

00:15:00
KATIE You know, like I've, you know, beat so many levels and I get just so stimulated from that or, uhm, so frustrated because I can't beat level, you know. And I'm just like gotta put it down and go back to life. And it's kinda like my life becomes a respite of Candy Crush. 

00:15:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:15:15
KATIE So... 

00:15:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT So, it almost flip-flopped a little bit for you, that it's gotten so bad - 

00:15:20
KATIE Yeah. 

00:15:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - for you that it-- that not just playing becomes the time where you can zone out a little bit and take a break. 

00:15:25
KATIE Yeah. And certain levels are just said tough. You know, you play million times-- and then, you know, the Candy Crush-- I don't know if you've ever played but it has like this timer where you, you know, have to beat this quest and you have to recharge you lives. And you can pay money to get lives from others and that gets expensive, so I tried really not to do that a lot. Uhm, but yeah, there's just that waiting and like-- it's like you're just going through the motions of life while you're waiting on your lives to be recharged or somebody give you life. 

00:15:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. So, some of that anxiety and, - 

00:16:00
KATIE Yeah. 

00:16:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - and feelings of... 

00:16:00
KATIE And you realize how much anxiety was part of it until it started writing it down. 

00:16:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. You mentioned this the first time about the idea of spending money to buy new lives. How much would you say spend on an average week on new lives on with the game? 

00:16:15
KATIE Uhm, it's like a dollar of lives. So, all right, I'll probably do it like 25 and 20 times - 

00:16:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:16:20
KATIE - depending on how time I'd been able to Candy Crush. Ah... 

00:16:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT This so-- if, uhm, I put it once or twice the idea that you kind of wait if you don't do well and a new life sort of appear but you also can kind of buy in - 

00:16:35
KATIE Right. 

00:16:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - uhm, extra lives. And about... 

00:16:35
KATIE Yeah. 

00:16:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT You said some over 25 and 10 dollars a week you'll, - 

00:16:40
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:16:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - you'll spend on that. 

00:16:40
KATIE Yeah, cuz it really-- you have like two moves left and you could have-- like, you only have two more jellies to clear, like, you can pay to clear, you know, to get more lives. And then you only have too much allies so might as well - 

00:16:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:16:50
KATIE - pay to do that. 

00:16:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:16:55
KATIE So that the way. 

00:16:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT That's insidious though with marketing, right, to kinda get you so close and you have to pay and to do that. 

00:17:00
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:17:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, do you have that kind of money to spend on it or it's like creating some hardship for yourself? 

00:17:05
KATIE Uhm, I'd really rather not spend on that cuz it's-- I like to spend my money well and on tangible things, so that's not something I feel like as a good investment - 

00:17:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:17:15
KATIE - for the money-- little money I do have, you know. It's not a good way to spend it. 

00:17:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. So, we've been talking for a couple of weeks now. Uhm, how, how-- maybe for you ask to-- if I ask to sometimes we're you've been successful, uhm, being able to cut back maybe sometimes where it didn't work out so well and you found yourself, uhm, maybe frustrated or angry or upset because you, you found yourself back into that cycle again. Well, what's going well and what's been harder for you? 

00:17:40
KATIE Well, now that I know, it is like anxiety driven or, you know, being overwhelm or needing a break or something like that. I've tried other things to try to deal with that. Uhm, just kind of like mindfulness or, uhm, meditation, I just, you know-- I fe-- I realized that I'm in a place of unrest and that's when I go to Candy Crush. Or, when I get that way with Candy Crush, that's when I go back to life. 

00:18:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:18:10
KATIE So, it's like I'm trying to like start substituting some of those other things. I just, you know, being at pissed of myself, uhm, in the moment and, uhm, just trying to call myself. And these are some relaxation techniques, uhm, cuz I'd rather not use Candy Crush as a solution cuz I feel like it's also a problem. 

00:18:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:18:35
KATIE Uhm, so I think that's been helping a little bit. Uhm, but honestly, if my phone is within reaching, I will wanna go to that and I can't get myself to that place that I wanna be, you know, to be able to actually relax. 

00:18:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:18:50
KATIE So, uhm, I have to remember to put my phone somewhere else or give it to somebody and then go in another room and do my thing, you know, and that's not always possible. 

00:19:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. So, part of where your success has been, has been separating out a bit more where your phone is so that you don't have that access problem. And if it's on your hand then you have lives and the temptation to play is really pretty high for yourself. 

00:19:15
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:19:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. And then other times you're identifying this idea of when you do play it's kind of a distraction. It's a, a way to deal with some anxiety. Uhm, and you've tried some other things, you said mindfulness - 

00:19:25
KATIE Hmm. 

00:19:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - and, yes, maybe some breathing exercises or you're being able to kind of center yourself. What else does work for you? Have you tried other things to-- like exercise or, uhm, you know, distraction techniques to, to get away from that? Any of those work? 

00:19:40
KATIE No, I haven't tried exercise yet. I'm just been trying to steal my mind, I think. Uhm, so that-- I mean, exercise sounds good but I can't really do that on a bus. 

00:19:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:19:50
KATIE I can't really... 

00:19:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT If she would just walk back and forth, that people probably look weird. 

00:19:55
KATIE Yeah. The aisle. 

00:19:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT They're like, "What are you doing?" kind of that. Okay, so that's harder. 

00:20:00
KATIE Yeah. 

00:20:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT So when you're restricted in space, when, when you're maybe tempted, there's not a lot else you can do. 

00:20:05
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:20:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT That's where you get stuck. 

00:20:05
KATIE Yeah, to be mindful in the bus, I even like put my phone, like, in my purse and my backpack, like, on the bottom so they get more of a challenge to get to it. And then just to be able to like remember how far away it is, you know, and to think to myself I can, I, I can be mindful cuz I have to go through extra amounts of stuffs to get to my phone. 

00:20:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uh-hmm. 

00:20:25
KATIE And then that sound tedious and detail but it's not gonna stop. It's 

00:20:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah, it makes, makes sense to me. I mean-- and it sounds like there's two different times, you know, talking about the times you've been successful and maybe not as successful. But there's time where you, uhm, aren't really even aware or mindful of what's going on and you're just gonna reach for it that very-- when you wake up first thing in the morning - 

00:20:45
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:20:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - and you kinda reaching for the phone. And there's other time where you're very aware, uhm, almost like you're seeking it out. Uhm, you're overwhelmed with-- uhm, like you've talked before that being overwhelmed with the class - 

00:20:55
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:20:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - feeling frustrated, uhm, with all the things that you're supposed to do and this something that, uhm, you can lose yourself and you know for a while that's coming. 

00:21:05
KATIE Yes. 

00:21:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:21:05
KATIE Exactly. 

00:21:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT That's a tough place to be. How are things with your boyfriend as, you know, as you're trying to cut back, is he mimicking that for you or is he making it harder or easier? What's his take? 

00:21:15
KATIE Uhm, I just kinda let him be. I'm not really, you know, try to intervene with him. Uhm, so I'm doing things differently and he continues to do it so it kind of actually brings more awareness to me - 

00:21:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:21:30
KATIE - how much he play it. So, that's tough, uhm, because I hope out of this, I get more time with him, more, you know, one-on-one or meaningful time. Uhm, but I'm not really sure how to do that, like, I'm just trying to work on me and me not doing it so much. So, I'm not sure how to like include him in that process yet. 

00:21:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. What's his take on your coming here on therapy. Have you talk to him about coming here? Is that something you kept private? 

00:22:00
KATIE Uhm, no, I've told him I'm here. Uhm, he says that Candy Crush is a more of a passion than, ah, an addiction. Uhm, so, and then he is always right. So, I said, "Okay, sure." Uhm, yeah, so I just-- I think he think it's silly that I'm here and - 

00:22:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:22:20
KATIE - that I need help with it or I'm asking for help with it. So, yeah, I don't know how would that go. 

00:22:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. Well, you don't think it's silly. I mean, it feels like something that's causing some pain for you when you're feeling more out of control you shared, you know, using a-- in class once - 

00:22:35
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:22:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - and a professor kind of being frustrated at you and, you know, - 

00:22:35
KATIE Yeah. 

00:22:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - it's caused you some problems in your life. 

00:22:40
KATIE Yeah. 

00:22:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, so, you know, we're looking at the past couple of weeks, you have like you said some success, some failures, uhm, what's been working for you, what's not been working as well? Where do we go from here in terms of like the plan, uhm, you said the mindfulness works a little bit. Maybe one of the challenges when you're in an enclosed space - 

00:23:00
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:23:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - that's little harder for you to be able to, uhm, access the phone. You've done some things to keep it away from you. How that triggers around during anxiety when you just find yourself drawn to it? Uhm, have you thought some of those? 

00:23:15
KATIE Yeah, uhm, like, if I were at a restaurant or a bar and my boyfriend is playing, I don't feel like I can be like in my zone and that let that public place where I feel like people are looking at me or with, you know, wonder what I was doing. Uhm, so I then-- I bring out my phone and, you know, it's like we're in the same place, we're in a social atmosphere but we're both on our phones. 

00:23:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah, so there's some kind of awkwardness there if you guys are mismatch like you're sort of sitting there looking at him and he's, you know, on the phone. You're like, "Well, I guess I've looked busy, too - 

00:23:50
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:23:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - I think so it doesn't feel awkward." 

00:23:55
KATIE Yeah. Or, like I should be occupying myself because he's occupied. I think I need to be occupied, too. 

00:24:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:24:00
KATIE So, I'm not thinking about, "Oh, well, I lose," you know, and then, you know, I wish he was paying more attention to me like kind of thing. 

00:24:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. Try to avoid the-- larger conversation with him, you know. So as a therapist, I'm always drawn to people talking and trying to explore, you know, fighting, compromising things. It sounds like, uhm, he's comments are but dismissive to you, you know. It's a passion, so I don't wanna change it. 

00:24:20
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:24:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, not really understanding, you know, how it's affecting you. How much of that is the way he is versus how much about is what you're willing to share with him about? Like, had-- does he understand that it's, it's really gone beyond just a, a problem for you but it's something that's causing you some pain. 

00:24:40
KATIE Uhm, yeah. I think I've expressed that, you know, to him. I think he, uhm, feels like he has a lot of control over his life and would think that I have the same - 

00:24:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uh-hmm. 

00:24:50
KATIE - amount of control. And, uhm, like to him, it's just a fine game to do and to me it's like, it's become more than a fun game, like, this has been my entire Christmas vacation with my phone, you know. And now I'm like whole. Like, what other things could I have done with that time? I could have spend with family here, you know, - 

00:25:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:25:15
KATIE - catching out or getting ahead, you know. 

00:25:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT So, feeling a lost-- like lost time - 

00:25:20
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:25:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - that you can't get back. 

00:25:20
KATIE Well, I was a little feeling of lost time because I feel like you can't get that back and there's something you can do in time, so why waste it? 

00:25:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uh-hmm. 

00:25:30
KATIE Attached to a device. 

00:25:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Is this a problem if you guys, another of areas of your life has kind of listening emphatically to you or trying to understand kind of what's going on for you. Uhm, how, how does this play out in non-Candy Crush, kind, kind of areas? I mean, is he more attentive if you have other concerns or I guess your picking a movie or going out to dinner, did you feel like he listens to you in those areas as well? 

00:25:50
KATIE Yeah, I do. And I think that, uhm, he's very attentive which is one thing that I'm, you know, drawn to him for. 

00:26:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. Yeah. 

00:26:00
KATIE I think it's just the Candy Crush. It's like, it's a, it's a game. It's a silly little app on a, on a cellphone. 

00:26:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uh-hmm. 

00:26:05
KATIE And I guess it doesn't make sense to him. You know, it's like, why, you know, why are you so in need of an intervention for that, or you know, like-- yeah. 

00:26:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. If we talk a little bit about your anxiety, uhm, and I don't know if that's a fair word if you use anxiety to describe it, that when you turn to the, the game at times and, and you're wanted to explore that a little bit. Do you find yourself anxious in other settings? What, what are some of the triggers for your anxiety when you find yourself worrying or becoming upset? 

00:26:40
KATIE It's usually about time. 

00:26:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:26:40
KATIE Yeah, like being someone who is working and going to school. I do that because I'm afraid to graduate and don't have any experience, you know, and then going to school-- or if I just work then I would waste time where I could be learning and getting an advanced degree. 

00:27:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:27:00
KATIE So, I tend to like overlap things and try to multitask. Uhm, and with Candy Crush, there's no multitasking except that I can travel to a place and Candy Crush. 

00:27:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uh-hmm. 

00:27:10
KATIE You know, like on a bus, uhm, on the airplane, you know, wherever I'm going. It's, it's a way-- cuz I feel like travel time is a waste of time, you know, like trying to be more productive. And the Candy Crush is not productive, like there's no outcome. It's just a game - 

00:27:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uh-hmm. 

00:27:30
KATIE - you know, and you get levels and stuffs. So, uhm, I stressed a lot about of time and managing time well and being productive. 

00:27:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah, a graduate school I'm sure is not making it any easier. 

00:27:40
KATIE No. It's sort of demanding. 

00:27:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT And work on top of it. Yeah, it's a tough place to be. 

00:27:45
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:27:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Nevertheless, like we talked a little bit about, uhm, change theory and how, you know, trying to change his behavior isn't something that, you know, is kind of a overnight process. And that when you're trying to change a habit that's gotten especially one that's so marketed well, you know, the extra lives and that little happy, like, noises it that makes like it-- You get, you know, attached to it in a really profound way when you're trying to change this. You know, you've moved through precontemplation. Clearly, this is something that you wanna, wanna change and that you're concerned about. 

00:28:15
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:28:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT You've really moved beyond contemplation. You know it's a problem. You're ready to change. You've taken some steps. You've come in therapy, we've talked, we've tried some things, youv've tried some action, and now we're in this, you know-- is this changing well Or, are you relapsing and kinda going back to the bottom like sheets in ladders? You know, we're kinda - 

00:28:30
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:28:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - back down to the beginning. Uhm, and you've seen some positive. You've been successful so far. To remind you of t his in cutting back, uhm, some of the techniques you've been doing to be mindful, breathing exercises we talked about, uhm, as well as you know, keeping the phone a little more distant from you this times where you're feeling, you know, challenged. So, what I would say is we'll keep working on this, uhm, from here and then we'll, you know, meet again for another couple of times and talk about, uhm, what's next for you. Is that good? 

00:29:00
KATIE Yes. 

00:29:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:29:00
KATIE Thank you. 

00:29:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT So, that's, uhm, we'll take a break for a second. Kind of the mid-session, uhm, typical session that we would go through. Uhm, some of the goals that I wanted to have was to begin I think to explore a little bit more around, uhm, the addictive qualities here looking for other causes, the idea of anxiety came up. But like any addiction, uhm, sometimes boredom is, is part of the key here being locked into a place. So, you know, we have time where she's drawn to it based on desire and seeking it out another times where it just something to do and becomes a habit. So, we're fighting this habit kind of in this battle looking for ways to discuss change, uhm, looking for ways to discuss, uhm, other things that we can insert as we're taking something away that we're putting something in back. We've talked about breathing exercises talked about, uhm, reading books, finding other distractions she can insert that might be a little more productive in her mind. So, uhm, let's fast-forward time and space again. I will be about four more sessions down. At this point, Katie(ph) has some real success in kinda reducing that. She's made a decision that she doesn't wanna have Candy Crush completely out of her life right now or take the steps to make that happen. And we're really looking more at the harm reduction model how can we identify the main sources of harm, playing during class, uhm, getting in a way of communication with her boyfriend. So, she's had some successes on moving forward. It's been about eight sessions so far, and at this stage, I feel like we've reached a bit of a plateau. I wanna give her a chance to do some work alone and then to come back in usually about two months later, a month later, check and see how things are going and how they're developing. So, it's where we would be, uhm, at this stage. So, we'll talk a little bit about termination, how to make the progress going, looking at some social supports, talking to other friends who've been supportive for her, and then moving forward and keeping that process. So, we'll go from here. Katie(ph), good to see you again. How have you been doing? 

00:30:55
KATIE I'm doing a little better. Uhm, we kept trying to do the mindfulness. And after we, you know, have been talking and lot of ways to be more productive, you know, with that time, the downtown. And I do think being mindful, uhm, was a good way to spend time cuz I feel like it helps me to center myself and to address the anxiety or feeling of over-- being overwhelmed, uhm, in the way that is, uhm, more focused on wellness for me - 

00:31:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:31:30
KATIE - instead of just like a band aid that, uhm, shifting my focus to something else that a lot-- that also happened to be anxiety provoking. Uhm, yeah, so I'm pretty happy with that. I've, you know, we talked about exercise and I've been trying to maybe take a walk especially that work. Uhm, when I'm just feeling over-stimulated with all the things that are going on. Uhm, but I still find it like really tough in the class cuz I feel like I can't go anywhere and I can't, you know, do anything. 

00:32:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:32:05
KATIE I'm trapped there. 

00:32:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. That's one of your triggers we've talked about a couple times when you're in a situation where you can't do the other kinds of things that you wanna do. But you know you're more healthy cognitively but you're trapped. 

00:32:15
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:32:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT That's a really good word. You kinda stuck in that class environment and, uhm, the phone is there and still so tempting. 

00:32:20
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:32:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT And you need it there because you know, you've talked about your e-mail and other access and, uhm, but the, the temptation to, ah, to play is a, a fight that you continue to have. 

00:32:30
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:32:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Now, where's-- where do you say your time is down to now in terms of how often you're playing? We start our probably around like 68 hours. It's been a number of weeks we've been working on things. Where have you been lately? 

00:32:45
KATIE Uhm, let see. So I probably pay-- play about a half hour in the morning and maybe a half hour to an hour at night. Uhm, and then, throughout the day, maybe one to two hours - 

00:33:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:33:00
KATIE - usually like 15 to 20 minutes increments throughout the day. 

00:33:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm, so pretty significant cutback, ah, - 

00:33:05
KATIE Yeah. 

00:33:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - from where you started. 

00:33:10
KATIE Yeah. I, I think so. 

00:33:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. It's kind of a bitter sweet, right, like on one hand you feel good about it, you know, like, "Ah! Cool! I've cutback," or "I feel good about it," for you, on the other hand, that's still one, two, three, four hours that you're - 

00:33:20
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:33:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - uhm, kinda using it. And, uhm, how do you feel about that time? So... 

00:33:25
KATIE It does seems like a lot of time, - 

00:33:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:33:30
KATIE - you know, that I, I could be doing other things. 

00:33:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:33:30
KATIE Yeah. 

00:33:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT It's particularly harder I think cuz you know, you're also-- I think beating, we've talked about this beating yourself out, feeling guilty for the times where you, you do-- are playing, you know, trying to enjoy that time, uhm, and you're spending that, uhm, kinda cursing yourself. 

00:33:45
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:33:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT "Oh, god! I can't believe I'm doing this," you know, and, and feeling bad about it so you're getting mad. Kind of double whammy of feeling bad that you're playing and losing the time. 

00:33:55
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:33:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Ah, we've talked about that harm reduction model in, in different way to think about mindfulness that when you do choose to play that you enjoy what's in front of you - 

00:34:05
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:34:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - and you have some limits on what that is, and the you work on you're kinda keeping those boundaries. Uhm, does the half hour in the morning and the half hour at night feel good to you different in the stuff during the day? I mean, does that - 

00:34:15
KATIE Yeah - 

00:34:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - feel like a... 

00:34:15
KATIE - definitely. I'm okay, like, as I feel like multitasking. I'm gonna drink my coffee and there's now a lot that I can do while drinking coffee - 

00:34:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah, yeah. 

00:34:25
KATIE - and it's not that safe. Uhm, so I'm okay with, like, candy crushing or sipping coffee, but I know that I could finish my cup of coffee quicker if I wasn't playing Candy Crush. 

00:34:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Sure. 

00:34:35
KATIE But I feel like I just to enjoy it more. Uhm, so I have allowed myself to enjoy that part of it. 

00:34:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uh-hmm. 

00:34:40
KATIE And then going to bed like sitting in bed or lying in bed, and just trying to like wind up my day. I'm okay with that - 

00:34:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:34:45
KATIE - you know. Uhm, cuz eventually I do fall asleep. It's not like it keeps me awake. 

00:34:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hmm. 

00:34:55
KATIE Uhm, play on it throughout the day, I don't enjoy it. I wanna know, I wanna play during the day. 

00:35:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT That's where kinda hit those danger points a little more like either at work or with school you find yourself in situations where you really shouldn't be playing or - 

00:35:05
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:35:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - uhm, in occasion, it bit sounds like there's a breaker, something you can do during the day. But, for the most part, uhm, that's where it feels more out of control for you. 

00:35:15
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:35:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:35:15
KATIE Yeah. 

00:35:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. Well, we've talked for, you know, about eight weeks and, uhm, what I'd like propose for you-- I know we haven't fixed this problem completely, uhm, but I-- I'd love to you know, space things out a little bit, you know, cuz of your insurance company and how often they're gonna pay for this. And, and I know money is a hardship certainly for graduate students - 

00:35:35
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:35:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT So, what I'd like to do is, you know, to continue to see to you. But I actually spaces out a little bit and see how you do working on some of the techniques that we've talk about, things like, you know, being aware and mindful when you're playing. Uhm, maybe focusing a bit more on the morning and the night playing is something that you can enjoy and work in to your, into your, uhm, schedule and trying again to cut back a little bit more in those times during the day. 

00:36:00
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:36:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT And probably meet again in about a month, you know, checkings, you know, see how things are going. I'm gonna move from there. So, is that okay? 

00:36:10
KATIE Yes. 

00:36:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. Thanks for your spending your time with us. 

00:36:10
KATIE Thank you. 

00:36:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. Uhm, so I'd like to do the question this way if we could, ah, either questions for me or questions for Katie(ph). I'd love to draw on your experience, uhm, with addictions what are the things that you would do differently, things that you like, things that you didn't like just to get an opinion in how you might have approached this maybe differently than I did as we move forward. Or, are there questions that you might have? Yeah, please. 

00:36:35
 I'm joining all of it. Sounds, sounds great. Uhm, I-- I'm really willing to when people like, say they, ah, are born or they turn to someone that I give them-- I give out stress balls, then they use those kinds of things. 

00:36:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:36:50
 And she talks about multitasking. So many times that I feel like, you know, that, that, that helps with that multitasking. 

00:36:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:36:55
 Like that, and so, I would try to, ah, I guess interest the boredom as well cuz that generated from boredom. It seems like she had to feel every moment of her life. She wasn't comfortable with like just gazing off and daydream. 

00:37:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. That's a really good observation and I, I love that idea of giving them something to kinda do with their hands. Uhm, I, I was tempted I think throughout the sessions and with someone that I met with. I think, uhm, actually, you know, I overtime. I might have introduced the concept of flow theory, uhm, by Csikszentmihalyi's, uhm, work on, you know, kind of losing yourself in space. Uhm, if you're, if you're familiar with the flow theory, there's a great TED talk on it. You can learn the heart of it by 10 minutes if I were listening to him talk about it. But it's doing these things that we just lose our self in that we have the ability to, uhm, do well, that they don't stress us out almost like-- what are some examples-- gardening, uhm, meeting. You know, there's people who's always jealous to the people at conferences like meeting long time. I'm like, "How do you do that? It's so cool." But they're not thinking about it. They just say, "It's like magic to me," right? So, you get lost in those activities like working out, playing sports, uhm, doing martial arts, doing like a form, doing dance, doing, uhm, even video games and certainly Candy Crush, right? It's something she has the ability to do well and can lose herself in. And what a temptation for a graduate student who's in a world full with chaos and destruction, right, a chance to just focus and do something. So, that idea of losing yourself in the flow, I don't think is a particular negative concept however it's one that's getting out of control for her and her life and resonating in different areas, ah, and room full of therapists, right? So we're all feeling like relationship stuff, dealing of yourself when you're bored, you know, not being perfect, you know. All these theories like sort of come up for me as I'm talking to her. But even something as simple as just replacement and destruction, uhm, is a power, you know, some type of, uhm, buddy or plate or Bendy Sticks or Wikki Stix. Yeah, really good suggestion. Other concepts? Yeah, we'll go here and then here. Yeah. 

00:38:55
 How do you want when you're dealing with that-- deal with the replacement doesn't come unique? 

00:39:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Right. Yeah. I wanna be like, "Here's Candy Crush, too." 

00:39:10
 I'm so sorry. Uhm, what - 

00:39:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Exactly. 

00:39:10
 - be as the replacement you help it with her Candy Crush - 

00:39:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Right. 

00:39:15
 - and something else... 

00:39:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Messages like been watching Buffy episodes. Yeah. It's, ah, yeah, it's absolutely-- you know, in the way I would address that is I think, uhm, more of a thorough exploration during the first earlier sessions of other issues that are sort of work-- cuz it's not-- it's never about the-- just the thing in front of you, right? It's also is about something deeper. So, we got-- we touched briefly on this idea of anxiety and sort of worry. And I, I even pulled a little bit more towards, you know, being productive. And, and with Katie(ph), my goal would be you know, how are you productive and when can be sometimes when you're not productive. In helping her, maybe that ties some of the mindfulness to you. Can you just give yourself mission to took off, you know, what that's like. Uhm, so when we're thinking about replacements, you know, if she does have an addictive personality who wanna be careful that we've solve this and now she's like drinking heavily in the bar with her boyfriend, right, and I would put or replace it with another bad behavior. Uhm, we have to be careful about that. And that's why I think the-- I'd rather do something where I'm stepping down therapy and for those who we work in the community, you know, the whole like eight sessions deal, right, like, you get, like, couple of approve and then you move through it. I'd always rather do that space out of over six months, uhm, every other week and then kind of step down and being-- continue to work with the person rather than like eight weekly sessions then be like, "Good luck with life," you know. Uhm, that's another way I kinda monitor as I move forward. Can you do for thoughts on that or sort of explaining your brain. 

00:40:45
KATIE Uhm, yeah. I mean, I think the, the need to be productive was kind of the thing I was feeling most and, uhm, permission not to be productive, you know, that it's okay to, to waste - 

00:41:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uh-hmm. 

00:41:00
KATIE - time on doing something that I enjoy. Uhm, but I'm just making sure that I feel comfortable with the way I'm enjoying that time - 

00:41:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uh-hmm. 

00:41:10
KATIE - and that on something that I can accept, uhm, and not feel guilty or embarrassed about her, you know, something that I can enjoy fully and share with others. 

00:41:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. How about distraction of work for you doing something besides the phone like, uhm, "I liking to go like a Rubik's cube," but that wouldn't work on something else that you kinda do with your hands and your mind that might not have that same kind of - 

00:41:35
KATIE Uhm... 

00:41:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - Candy Crush addictive quality to it? 

00:41:40
KATIE No. I think mind-- like just being centered and like mindful - 

00:41:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:41:45
KATIE - for me what have worked, like, done like a stress ball or something like that. I just don't think that I would have engaged in that, you know, like I'm one of them. I would probably leave it at home or you know, like-- and, uhm, I would just rather be able to find something within me that I could do anywhere just given the body that I have. 

00:42:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Sure. 

00:42:05
KATIE You know. 

00:42:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:42:05
 So, are you saying you've perceived Candy Crush has been productive because you're advancing levels and so forth? 

00:42:15
KATIE Ah... 

00:42:15
 Are you saying you're-- do ever you have a need to be doing something of being productive? So, ah, big you're doing Candy Crush, so are you perceiving that as productive? 

00:42:25
KATIE Uhm, at first it was a way to like spend time that I was bored when I was first learning and that was productive like, "Oh, I'm on level 63 or whatever." But then I got to be like, "Well, what am I really accomplishing with advancing on the levels. I didn't really feel like it was." And the broad scheme of things really productive, like, although I'm advancing in levels, it was no longer satisfying to me like it was at the beginning. It was a challenge of the beginning for time that I had to waste. But not that I'm back in session with school and work, I feel like that's not a good way to be productive. 

00:42:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT It's an interesting phenomena. I'm-- I all out myself as a, a pretty avid gamer call of duty and borderlands and first person shooters. I enjoy, uhm, a lot. I would echo that there's a joy up until a certain point, you know, of unlock the golden weapons, you've always unlocked you know, the kinds of things that you wanted to get, and then it, it does become a bit more rote. Uhm, and then you're just sort of pursuing things. And the early stages of pursuing things for, you know, the rush and the goal and to ge-- unlock something that's fun. As time moves on, it becomes something that you feel more, uhm, trap into. So we had a question here and on the back. Yeah. 

00:43:30
 It's a great segway to my observation that, uhm, that-- because that, that echos in the substance addiction also - 

00:43:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yes. 

00:43:40
 and as we go tolerance, then it's less and less fun - 

00:43:45
KATIE Uh-hmm. 

00:43:45
 - and rewarding. And we just perpetuate being a-- experience because of tolerance or addiction. 

00:43:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Trying to get to normal. Right, yeah. 

00:43:50
 So, what I noticed is that you didn't rush to offer a conflict. And so, often in especially substance addiction, we have these mirrored pamphlets and the counseling center and the health center. So, I, I'm not being on that. I mean, I grew up you know, doing, ah, addiction in the '70s. We have pamphlets galore. 

00:44:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Right. 

00:44:10
 And we know psycho education doesn't work. I only appreciate staying with her individual process evoking at sort of for personality architecture or infrastructure or offered issues that maybe propelling that. So, so, and, and I also, uhm, appreciate you sort of educating her. Okay, we've talked about change theory. Okay, we've talked about trigger. You're using terms that we use - 

00:44:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Right. 

00:44:40
 - well and what, what we teachers do. So, appreciating how did he learn. So, at what point do you sort of introduce addiction and what point do you talk about addiction for her? And or not you just stay on family, social, emotional issues? 

00:44:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah, You know, I, I-- that carry my clinical backgrounds very Rogerian and existential. You know, where I would define myself. And, uhm, I, I wish TBT work for me well. I just haven't found that experience. I mean, I, I use it obviously, you know, the idea of base lining behavior and, and educating them around change and thinking differently about things. I love teaching L.S. as well as the whole ABCs activating event your beliefs leading to different consequences. I worked it in, but with this client where I would had very quickly as early family stuff, you know, you owe 'em stuff, you know, where is this coming from, uhm, what are you-- what hole are you trying to fill. Cuz that I think you teach them the sort of how to behave differently and that's great. But it does-- it leaves that emptiness. Uhm, you really have to get to some of that underneath and some of that relationships stuff. So, for me, my draw out clinically with someone like Katie(ph) would be the relationship with her boyfriend and why he's not being more supportive and appreciating this as a problem as well as getting to some of this, uhm, being able to kinda sit comfortably with herself. And then, I'd be concerned about mindfulness that I felt like, you know, she was getting it on a cognitive level, but I also felt like that was some kind of lift service to the, the field. But I'm gonna be mindful now. It's like, "Hmm, all right, walk me through that like your just gonna like, uhm, I might achieve one this at the world - 

00:46:10
 Uh-hmm. 

00:46:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - or, you know, how are you doing now would me more that discussion. But, yeah, and I'm with you on that. Yeah, please. 

00:46:15
 I'm glad that you'd brought that because I'm at the same kind of situation here. 

00:46:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah, sure. 

00:46:20
 - I mean, this is essential, right? I don't think that's really an awful mistake, hearing that instead. I was going through a debriefing as you were saying, ah, you're one of us or you're, during this time, you're being very much had left the notion and look up and be free because she does have some of that anxiety for that matter. Building relationships and you're being with relationships with the game you actually hold. Assigning, you know, okay so we have the buzz. I want you top until you keep all things. That the potential for building relationships is always-- are around. It's-- you're always surrounded by people. And then our anxiety comes from not wanting to be around people. Why is that? like, unlike how you started going out with your boyfriend and probably you're in a relationship with him. It's like, ah, maybe that briefing and speaking. Are you happy for that goal and you're on the bus. Do you really think that by communicating with other people, ah, start in yourself when you're making new friends or probably you're seeing someone and there's someone laughing at you. I mean, you never know and there's anxiety. And even in some I, I, I wonder if that would be a segway into that in helping them deal with it. 

00:47:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT It's a brilliant one. Yeah. I, I think-- you, you know, for me, I'd always wanna make sure that they could receive the information. Ah, I'm very pamphlet averse myself and I know you're not suggesting like pamphlets here. But I-- even homework, you know, I worry that, that's more about me and feeling better about like I'd given him homework now and good therapies. 

00:47:50
 Uh-hmm. 

00:47:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Like, I've achieved what I've supposed to do. Uhm, so, on a cognitive level, it will be all about like, "What's-- have you talked with two people in the bus?" And it's, uhm, in the feeling where I know I wanna probably, you know, get a better Myers-Briggs sense of where she is, check out the intervention, extroversion, you know, how comfortable is she when engaging people. And, you know, at the rival possible hypothesis that I love to-- I love it if I thought of that and said, "Hey, you know, is this part of the problem? Should we move away from attack and move to personal connection? We write and explore friends either in social supports. And we, we... 

00:48:20
 Probably like you. 

00:48:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. And we should. I mean, absolutely. It shou-- it will be good to explore that people who could support her as well as, uhm, you know, encouraging her to be able to be more social. Yeah, if she's very introverted and this is just part of, you know, of what she needs, then it's an extroverted, you know, technique where she's not engaging people is their way to do that differently. But now well, well said and, and good points for sure. Yeah. 

00:48:40
 Yes, a little-- ah, she talked a little about, about her anxiety. Well, I'm thinking about working with people that, uhm, having addictions initially, you know, like you said, it's how you do that. It's kind of fun and from something that we almost like have to do-- could not feel in certain ways so - 

00:48:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:48:55
 - I think I'd like to know what I guess your experience with family, asking people, you know. A lot of it happen if you do like, in order to that process through routine that thinking of the phone, waiting all the while. I might be doing it because other people are doing it. And also, uhm, because she said that she didn't wanna feel, "I started my life with-- colorfully." He was doing it. She worked with her feeling and, and what, what happen if she just do it? 

00:49:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, kinda push here a little bit more about that. I like that. I mean, that reminds me a little bit of, ah, Perls' work in Gestalt therapy, you know, that kind of staying stung with that bad feeling. And, and I love pushing clients. It's very existential, you know, what, what would happen. Early on, it was pretty clear to me that her-- she had some reticence about her goal, that she-- you know, even though she came in, it was like this is what I wanna fix when I asked her about that. It was very much the miracle question kinda fell little flat like I'm not really sure. 

00:49:50
 Yeah. 

00:49:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, you know, one of the things I do-- and this is a bit of a segway is I'm, I'm very a proponent of harm reduction especially of the college students that, you know, what's good about it. And same with drinking. Uhm, I, I get a lot of flat for this, ah, in the field. But, ah, you know, drinking is awesome like-- I'm sorry if you guys are not on the same page as me, but you know, there's something that really happens when you have a couple of drink. You feel good, you buzz, you know, it's the biphasic curve kind of stuff. It feels great. All the bad stuff, you know, happens in the same way of Candy Crush right you start to get addicted to it. Uhm, you start to overuse and all the bad stuff to be familiar with the biphasic curve happens after, you know, certain point of intoxication. You no longer buzz and hop in, or you can't like find your butterfly and Bukowski. But I try to find stuff and stumbling around and fighting people in the bed, like things started to go wrong. Uhm, so for some, you know, AA is a wonderful program. It's one that I've supported and sent dozen of college students to and they've been successful at it. However, there's other students who just don't wanna go to AA and they're like, "I-- I'm not alcoholic. I just-- I'm drinking too much." And I said, "Well, let's talk about cutting that back." Uhm, so really that harm reduction pieces is important here to understand, is this someone who's-- cuz she's not ready to give up the phone, right? I mean, eight weeks session and she's down to like four. You know, from like eight hours to four. All right, it's okay for the insurance company. But when it comes back to it, that's not the kind of progress I'd like to see, uhm, so we keep pushing here hopefully and see where that goes. We have time for couple of more questions. Yeah. 

00:51:10
 The support system seems to you - 

00:51:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Change. 

00:51:15
 It's so critical. 

00:51:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Change absolutely. 

00:51:15
 And, uhm, I'm not aware of 12-step program that specifically for these types of addiction. 

00:51:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:51:20
 But I'm wondering whether would you think there might be another 12-step program wouldn't be an exact fit but where, uhm, she could go for, ah, the support or just the, ah, the spirituality of the program. And, ah, - 

00:51:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:51:40
 - could you think of like, ah, what might be palatable because there isn't a specific program - 

00:51:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:51:50
 - foster program with this. 

00:51:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT I-- it's a funny example but I'm thinking of Fight Club, if anyone seen the movie right about addiction to like the 12-step programs, there something about being with other people and that emotional intimate kind of environment that's healing, you know, and have often sent people to church for that same kind of reason that's always tricky and finding the right church. But you wanted the right things about a church or spirituality experiences that you have this community that begins to care for you and hold you accountable. And sometimes that goes little too far and you have to be careful about it. Uhm, but yeah, just general, I think 12-step programs, uhm-- I think one of the things we do in the field badly is that we bifurcate everything into this little compartments. And like now this is eating disorder addiction treatment and this is, you know, alcohol and this is, oh, you're addicted to painkillers and, ah, their, their similarities that overlap all of them. So, if I were running a group at a college center, I might try to do just a general addictions group and have different people from different walks of life because the process is so similar for so many of them. I think you have a question, I will jump here. Yeah. 

00:52:50
 Ah, yeah. 

00:52:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:52:50
 When you talked about why don't you replace it or a part-time in exercise and kinda make a little humor, we can't laugh at that them - 

00:52:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah, sure. 

00:52:55
 - on the backyard. But, uhm, I'm thinking of course with muscle organization, isometrics - 

00:53:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:53:05
 - they can go with, "Hey, should we have the cycle of exercise?" Let's explore the book on where according to - 

00:53:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Sure. 

00:53:10
 - hat's... 

00:53:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah, absolutely. Uhm, and if you have that skills that you were aware of some of those different, you know, muscle things that she could do in an, in an unclosed space, uhm, certainly. Yeah, good point. We'll go here and then over here. Yeah. 

00:53:20
 I'm assuming, uhm, she hadn't come in voluntarily cuz when I quit the video that came with addiction she said, "Think of it like misinterpret teenage boys, hmm, with this - 

00:53:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Right. Yeah. 

00:53:30
 - you know, who, who never lives the later day. 

00:53:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Sure. 

00:53:35
 Uhm, with that - 

00:53:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Look at the mine craft, yeah. 

00:53:35
 - more like, ah, intervention model first. I mean, someone who don't think they have a problem even though they're there all the time. 

00:53:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. With those kinds of modelings and you could imagine what's happening in a college setting, I think, or even a high school setting where she - 

00:53:45
 You know, you... 

00:53:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - starts using never leaves the room, starts to use, uhm, online in class, professor get upset, starts to agree a conduct issue just disrupting the academic environment. 

00:53:55
 Because he think he had struggled. 

00:53:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Right. Then I'm in, I'm in my mot-- I mean motivational interviewing so I'm doing the same kind of stuff, uhm, with mandated treatment. My differences, I just try to make it not mandated after the first session, like I wanna have to hook on. And if they're not into talking with me, uhm, you know they commented like I don't wanna talk to a psychologist about this. This is bullshit. And you're like, "Yeah, I met a lot of psychologists before too and they're kinda crazy," so you know, your role of resistance, you with, uhm, -- you've developed rapport, you get into an advocacy position with them and you build connection. And that, especially with college students and younger kids, it's so important. Uhm, and then you start to work on this kind of things. But those queer elements of motivational interviewing if you're not aware, it's, it's expressing empathy, helping them understand. I might share, you know, some of my own experiences playing video games and, and kind of getting that initial rush and enjoying it and then feeling almost like chained to it like, "Why I maybe doing this?" like, "I'm on level 52 and who cares if I get like this extra little thing for the gun that I want." like I'm-- this is a waste of time. I should be doing something else. You can not only help them, you know, empathize with their play but you help them understand that you really do get this in a profound way rolling with resistance. They come out to you like, "This is bullshit. And I have to be here, right?" And instead of challenging back like, "How dare you insult me like I'm being paid for this. This is my job and you're coming in here with an attitude. That's not gonna fly, Mister." Right. That-- that's not the way to approach it. You kinda roll with it. Help him develop discrepancy. Right. You help them understand that what their currently doing is not gonna get them where they wanna go. You know, her frustration that comes through really clearly is this is making me unhappy. Ah, this is something that feels out of control for me and doesn't feel okay. And then supporting self-efficacy, catching them, uhm, doing well, you know, and re-framing in a positive way. You caught me doing that a little bit. This is good. You've made some change. It's not gonna happen overnight. This is a marathon, not a sprint. Let's keep moving forward. Yeah. 

00:55:50
 I, I just wanna that I really appreciate what harming do, what a harm reduction model is. As respect of this model, do you think there like a lot of people in this field don't necessary look at it from that point of view? Uhm, and then you also like looking about that positive intention behind that where you don't really look at what value is starting to, ah, fill. Maybe start to look at okay, well, if this is about the value that you're trying to fill with this but you don't want to do this, what other activities would kind of bring it back to that? You know, come back and really, that's not a big match. 

00:56:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. I really like, too. 

00:56:20
 (inaudible ) Thank you for the (inaudible ). 

00:56:26
BRIAN VAN BRUNT You're welcome. 

00:56:26
 harm reduction model. I was like, you know, had a lot of training. 

00:56:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. There's another question. 

00:56:30
 I just wanna say, ah, online games are synonymous. 

00:56:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT I think, right, they are. Yeah. 

00:56:35
 There's always that... 

00:56:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT I thought you're playing Candy Crush. Just wanna say I made it at level three. 

00:56:40
 I wanna say-- so online games are anonymous and there's a OLG anon. for family members. Online gamers anon. for family and friends. I mean, mean - 

00:56:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Well, that might be... 

00:56:50
 - what abstinence is based? And as supposed to Katie(ph), she's way-- she's not there yet. So the good news is there's a support group, the bad news is it might have been too early to refer that. So that's... 

00:57:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT And then you guide them through this support. And we that the problem I've had with harm reduction modeling is that there's, you know, work on your own. Uhm, you know, for the most part, moderation management and all but that, you know, hasn't cut on as much. But, you know, the nice thing about AA is they're all over the place and they meet all the time and you for your community and you get connected to people. But the bad thing about it is this, I have this anti-authority thing big as our project. Uh, well, I just-- I, I feel like I don't like that inflexibility, you know, being-- I, I missed my, uhm, '70s time. I wish I were born a little earlier like that. I, I like the idea of, of having some flexibility built in a discussion not what I've heard, told the college students that I have sent to AA before which is, uhm, until you're ready to say that you're an alcoholic. I'm not gonna talk to you anymore. And that-- I, I get that that works in some settings, but I also think it turns of a lot of the, the younger folks. And we get to tell these arguments then like well that means they're not ready to accept their problem. And, and I could see the point here that really she would have a better life if she was just like Candy Crush goes away and you know, when did an abstinence probably would get better quickly-- more quickly. But she's, she's gonna do that and that, that's where the client, uhm, autonomy comes in for me about respecting you know, like I talked to college students all the time, like, you're in 17 girls and I-- it's like-- yeah, would they have a better life? This cut out drinking altogether? Yeah, absolutely. They don't wanna do that. I'm like, so let's get you done in 10. You know, that's a weird thing to be talking about but with the college students, that's-- you start there and then see how that feels and love the baselining, you know. By definition, she's automatically in a cut back. And some over time, just by watching the behavior. Yeah. 

00:58:35
 I just think-- I mean, I, uhm, I really like how you approach this and especially since it sound like this was a road of a new problem for her - 

00:58:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uh-hmm. 

00:58:45
 - so I probably try to go with the, you know, let's step down to that. It's like, if she had coming with, you know, a lot of the consequences or she was feeling, her cla-- you know, that kind of thing - 

00:58:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT All right.

 - uhm, or, I mean, don't you think about what has happening is about the coaching with nothing. Something, there's not you. When do-- you know, I'll think about that in third thinking and that they're in that guess the one who respect you know, that the clients desire of where they are, you know, in terms of what they want to do. But, but I also think about it. If this person is really dangerous and, and or, and or kind of seem really severe consequence. I mean, when, you know, when would you start to introduce addiction, abstinence, like that kind of thing. 

00:59:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. We'll end on this question by the way, and let me just repeat it for everyone. This idea of like when would we start pushing a little harder on, you know, to the client if they have a behavior that's actually getting in the way, it's more serious, it's getting to the point of separation from school. It's just a serious problem. It's get-- let's say she was spending like a $100 a week on new lives where it's really you know, you're watching this unfold in front of you like well, like, if this keeps going this way, she's gonna be homeless and kick out of school. I need to have a harder, uhm, push. That's where I would use a lot of the motivational interviewing techniques especially developing discrepancy, uhm, and then really caring advocate-focused way helping her like Columbo like from, ah, you know, ah, Peter Falk on that TV show. You too bit if you're not aware. You're young and straight. Uhm, but there's this great guy who like have this way of kinda getting inside people's head. He had like this like fumbled code most like this detective and he put people at ease. But in his head, he was like, you know, more already kinda, you know, genius, uhm, and would come, "Well, one more thing. Let me ask you." like he would do that. And with her, I think that would be my approach, like, "Listen. I wanna help you but, you know, you really-- this seems like it's getting out of control. And like if I'm guessing in a couple of weeks from now, you're not gonna have more money to buy new lives. And what happens when you hit that bottom." So, I do a little more, uhm, pushing I think on that issue. So, thanks for spending some time with us. Uhm, thanks to Katie(ph) for the wonderful work.
