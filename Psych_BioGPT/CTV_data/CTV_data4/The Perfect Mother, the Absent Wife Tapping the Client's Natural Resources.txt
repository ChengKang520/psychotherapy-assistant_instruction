BRIEF THERAPY INSIDE OUT With Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling and Diane Kjos, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling. 

00:01:20
JON CARLSON All the therapy attempts to be brief. Brief therapy clearly identifies as a therapeutic focus in goal and then strives to reach that goal in a time limited, efficient, and systematic fashion. This series brings together the leading strategists in the area of brief therapy. Each will demonstrate their approach with real people with real life problems. 

00:01:45
THE PERFECT MOTHER, THE ABSENT WIFE. TAPPING THE CLIENT’S NATURAL RESOURCES BRADFORD KEENEY, PH. D. 

00:01:55
JON CARLSON Hi, I'm Jon Carlson, I like to welcome you to another session of Brief Therapy Inside Out. 

00:02:00
DIANE KJOS And I am Diane Kjos and this is our guest Brad Keeney who is going to talk to us about his approach to Brief Therapy. Brad, how would you define Brief Therapy? 

00:02:15
BRADFORD KEENEY Well, let me say what therapy is not for me. For me, therapy is not problem focused, therapy is not solution focused, it is not attentive to psychological explanation, it is not focused on any particular story or narrative rather it focuses upon a one central idea, that is client’s bring with them, the necessary tools gives resources that can help themselves evolve their situation in the way that they desire. So my responsibility is to be attentive to help them rediscover that which they have forgotten about themselves, about their own context and it so happens when you work that way more often than not its brief so its brief by some parsimonious gift of the therapeutic universe. So, I’m not organized to be a Brief Therapist. I find that working with an eye toward resourcefulness brings forth Brief Therapy. 

00:03:15
JON CARLSON Well, can you tell us your general strategy for what you do, but how does it work, can you talk more about the nuts and bolts the change process, may be the stages you might even go through? 

00:03:30
BRADFORD KEENEY Well for me, the central idea is to sit on the bank of the therapeutic river of discourse with a fishing pole and watching the cork bob on the water, just waiting for a little nibble that will suggest the possibility of a metaphor that can be resourceful for the client. As soon as I feel that I start to reel it in, so anything they might say that triggers in me, a hypothesis that this may suggest that there's something positive useful resourceful in their life I’ll work with it and as soon as we can set forth these metaphors or building blocks then we can move towards constructing for them a therapeutic reality. 

00:04:20
JON CARLSON So your tool is the hammer and resources are the nails, that’s what you're looking for? 

00:04:25
BRADFORD KEENEY I don't begin with the hammer, I think I begin by just simply looking in their life for where have hidden the building blocks, they are already there. I don’t have to bring them, they already have the building blocks, but they have forgotten them. They might have left them in the attic they might be in the backward, they could be in the basement. So, I have to help them re-find these therapeutic resourceful building blocks and then I get out my hammer or my string or my welding iron what not to help put these together and that process of therapy I call weaving, weaving these elements of resourcefulness. 

00:05:00
JON CARLSON You have identification and then what weaving? 

00:05:05
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes. 

00:05:05
JON CARLSON Those are primary stages? 

00:05:05
BRADFORD KEENEY Because if you have these elemental ingredients that each of which are positive and resourceful and the natural gifts of the client you must tie them together so they spin, if you wish, a context, a context that has I would call therapeutic closure that is there now experiencing all of their talk and they would experience when the perspective of their having gifts or having resources to work with. So that’s… that's weaving and it's that simple for me, I don’t carry a lot of theoretical baggage in terms of the operational procedures however, I do have my own theoretical ideas as to account for why this is effective. Yes. 

00:05:55
DIANE KJOS How did you get there, what influenced you and what brought you to this approach to therapy? 

00:06:00
BRADFORD KEENEY, Ph. D. Well, there are specific influences. At first there were some amazing performers of psychotherapy and I say that because their therapy was like watching and experiencing great theater and these particularly I think of Carl Whitaker, who was one of my mentors and whose work in therapy truly inspired me and it was never boring, it was always filled with a vitality and excitement of great theatrical performance. And so, there was that preformative sense of… of… of therapy that touched me and moved me. Secondly, I’m a jazz piano player and so the whole world of improvisation has been critical to me in seeing the therapy as a performance of improvisational conduct, you don’t know what they're going to say they… you don’t know what their first line is, you don’t know what they'll say to you, and hopefully you don’t know what you'd say the more open you are to surprise the more likely that imagination would touch the session and breathe life into it. You know it's working, I don’t say is the therapy working, I say is the therapy alive. You can feel when it's alive it's moving and that's when I would agree that it's working. So music and being inspired by some of the great performers the Mozart's of psychotherapy and… and also I’ve been quite fortunate to have had the opportunity to travel the world and meet indigenous Shamans and healers and to see the performance arenas for their specific ways of cultural healing and all of these have touched me and influenced and been ways of… of teaching me about… about the conduct of therapy. 

00:07:50
JON CARLSON, Psy.,D., Ed.D., ABPP Well, maybe you could help me a little bit more to understand how change takes place then in your approach. I know you wrote a book on change at one time. 

00:08:00
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes, I wrote a book on the esthetics of change, which attempted to articulate that change is not a… a simple complex, you can't say here's this specific thing I want to isolate from the client's life and then eradicate or vanish and so forth that there is no isolated action, it's always embedded within interaction and social ecology. And I have moved away from a focus on change rather than seeing what is it that must change and what is the process of affecting that change. I tend to see the organization that I encounter the family, the individual, the couple, as… as… as a… as a process that has a relationship between elements of change and elements of stability. So although, this can take us into abstract conversation suffice it to say that change serves the purpose of stabilizing or making… making present a relational ecology. So, for me, I'm careful about change because I know the family is and the client is drawing upon change as a way of trying to keep its identity. And… and… and so I do have an abstract way of navigating through these various slippery realm and at the same time it's not on my mind in the practice of… of therapy, I'm not thinking what needs to be changed what… what are the elements that comprise a process of change, this is on my mind… my mind in therapy to content. It's afterwards as we become theoreticians. 

00:09:55
DIANE KJOS Which you talk about in this… in this sense. 

00:09:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah, yeah. 

00:09:55
JON CARLSON And you look back and try to figure out what did I do. 

00:10:00
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes, precisely, postmortem. 

00:10:05
DIANE KJOS, Ph.D. Yes. (inaudible ). Have you found that there are particular kinds of clients that this works better with than others or that it doesn't work as well with or do you sort of have of an idea what will be an ideal client? 

00:10:20
BRADFORD KEENEY Well, I… for me, its… it's not a nature or category of client that will benefit more about this orientation. As it is that each of us gets on better with certain people and gets on less and that’s just our human nature, the reasons for that are too complex to ever understand but I'm mindful and aware when I find myself just not able to get on as easily with a particular client and then that may become a part of the therapy addressing that and can itself be resourceful. 

00:10:50
DIANE KJOS Interesting. 

00:10:50
BRADFORD KEENEY So, I think less in terms of categories of clients than just having a sense we're walking together in our conversation. 

00:11:00
JON CARLSON As you talk, it sound as if your approach is supported by the wisdom of the ages, but I'm also wondering if there's any empirical support for the work that you do? 

00:11:15
BRADFORD KEENEY Well, when I was a… an academic professor, we struggled with ways in which to you know address this kind of question. And we devised a qualitative research method called "recursive frame analysis", which enabled us to score a therapeutic session much like a musician would score a… a music or a dance choreography which score dance so we could watch and pull out the movement of the session in terms of frames and context and how they would be set in place and woven together and to map it. 

00:11:50
DIANE KJOS And repeating of the (inaudible ). 

00:11:53
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah, so we could have on… we could have on one sheet a score of the therapy and then we could have a larger series of sheets the particular moves that embodied that therapy. So, my response to that general question was to score therapy so that we might see what is this thing that we're talking about and I can have a clear sense of whether it's moving somewhere and certainly if it's moving toward the client and therapist feeling resourceful then that would be successful outcome, so the map itself is the answer. 

00:12:25
JON CARLSON I see. So it sounds like as if you can score a piece where if there's movement, you would call that the empirical support that you are looking forward to be successful. 

00:12:35
BRADFORD KEENEY Precisely, precisely. 

00:12:35
DIANE KJOS You talk about that the… the resources in… in both the therapist and the client and if going back to sort of this issue of developing a relationship, so when you identify that, is that sort of a new relationship or I mean how does that work in terms of developing a relationship with the client or working together, dancing together? 

00:13:00
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes, yes. At the same… if we dance, I mean you each… you each have to somehow stumble in the beginning to find a way to move together so that it's not a matter of one steering the other that both of you feel that you have stepped into a kind of interactional flow. So the amazing thing is when you truly step into the therapeutic mind I call it, the therapeutic voice or a therapeutic process, it feels like the therap… the client is telling you statements and utterances that awaken your imagination. A sense of there your therapist. They are throwing comments towards you to help awaken you to say the thing that will be therapeutic for them, so it's going both ways and that's a greater mind, that’s a greater voice and when it's really moving and flowing you feel like these ideas and these things that you say come up without any effort, you know saying that working what, you know what is going on and why don't you say it just appends naturally the same in great dance, you are swept away on the dance floor something feels like its dancing you. The musician feels totally touched by the music, they're not making the music, the music is flowing through them. So it's that flow experiences… that flow experience psychologist have talked about that's critical for the performance of therapy. 

00:14:20
JON CARLSON In some ways, I think words are the kind of discussion we're having now, might not really do justice or clearly provide clarity to the kind of work you do. In a moment we're going to watch you work with a young woman. Can you set that up for our viewers and maybe help them know what they should be looking for during this session? 

00:14:40
BRADFORD KEENEY I would say look at the way in which I attempt to be attentive to what this client presents. 

00:14:45
JON CARLSON Okay, so attentive. 

00:14:50
BRADFORD KEENEY Be attentive to what she brings to the table and how those frames and metaphors and utterances that imply pathology and being stuck will be sort of moved to the side in favor of those possibilities for… 

00:15:10
JON CARLSON Resources. Okay. 

00:15:10
BRADFORD KEENEY Resources and then, identifying these underscoring them through repetition, bringing them forth, putting the elements, the building blocks in place. 

00:15:20
JON CARLSON And weave them. 

00:15:20
BRADFORD KEENEY And then the next stage if you wish would be to weave those in the spinning of a therapeutic context and in that context the therapy takes place effortlessly on both of our parts. We'll each be walking together and have statements one to the other that are completely in synch and then you'll see how it will move towards the prescription of action that is resourceful in… in particularly mobilizing the resources of the client. 

00:15:55
JON CARLSON Well, let's watch how the client changes as a Brad's behavior. 

00:16:00
DIANE KJOS Yeah, I'm really looking forward to this. 

00:16:00
BRADFORD KEENEY I'm looking forward to. 

00:16:00
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

00:16:00
BRADFORD KEENEY (inaudible ) to be unchanged(ph) always, yes. 

00:16:05
DIANE KJOS Okay. Great. 

00:16:10
BRADFORD KEENEY Thank you for coming. 

00:16:10
No problem. 

00:16:15
BRADFORD KEENEY And you can discuss anything you want tonight and just give me some sense in the beginning. What's going with you? And what would you like to focus on? 

00:16:20
Alright. Umm… basically, I've been married for three years my husband is an alcoholic and I have baby at home and we're dealing… now we're dealing with the marriage problem and an alcohol problem. I moved out of the house and for the last two weeks my husband has been playing emotional games on me. One minute he wants to make it work the next minute he doesn't. Basically, one of the reasons I left is due to his alcoholism, the other reason is because he verbally abuses me and I can only take so much. 

00:16:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Hmm… hmm… 

00:16:55
I’ve been doing… well, I’m a full-time working mom who works three nights with the palsy and like I said I have a baby at home which… if you don’t know is a lot of responsibility. 

00:17:05
BRADFORD KEENEY Hmm… hmm… 

00:17:05
And I basically I've been doing the blunt of everything and about two weeks ago just completely lost my mind and called mom and said, can I come home? From that point on he has been more verbal abusing and… every other day changing his mind, I don't know what's he wants to do and what he doesn't want to do. And I've asked myself many times what do I want to do? I don’t know what I want to do, really don’t know. Part(ph) of me feels like this is the person I married for better worse and part of me is like I think I've been through enough, maybe I could do it on my own and… and I've a better chance of so my daughter can have a really good life, which is my biggest concern. 

00:17:45
BRADFORD KEENEY How old is your daughter? 

00:17:45
She really is 20 months old, she'll be two in August. 

00:17:50
BRADFORD KEENEY Okay, so you're hands truly are full. 

00:17:50
My hands are truly, truly full. 

00:17:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah. 

00:17:55
Very truly full. She's a very (inaudible ) thing she is really very active. I feel I cannot, she's is the joy of my life. I hope not to be one of those mothers who puts everything I have into her and I have nothing left for myself, I'm learning also to set some time aside for myself, which is very hard. You know my mom is trying to show me it's okay so go out leave her home. I mean up until now I've never been able to leave her, but then (inaudible ) anyone beside my nana and my sisters because of his alcohol problem, which he doesn't really want to get help for. He doesn't really seem to think there's(ph) a problem. 

00:18:35
BRADFORD KEENEY So you really want to be a good mother and do the right thing. 

00:18:35
Yeah. He seems to think that I want to be a mother more than I want to be wife, which I don't really think is true, it's just that I've had a role and I don't think he realizes that she does take a lot of work a lot of paying attention to and I don't know is to how to use the right words. So, but she needs a lot more attention than he does right now and he's also an… a kind of person who's always been the center of attention in everyone's life. And he just don't know how to accept the fact that my attentions now are going towards more towards Casey and not him. 

00:19:10
BRADFORD KEENEY Now, when you say he's an alcoholic, give me a some sense of what that means to you, as this is what everyone is saying, as this is, (inaudible )? 

00:19:21
Basically, he has a good job. 

00:19:21
BRADFORD KEENEY He is able to keep a job. 

00:19:25
He has been able to keep a job. He's been into this job that he has for about three years, which is as long as we've been married, he's been here in Illinois for about seven years, he's originally is from Pittsburgh. 

00:19:35
BRADFORD KEENEY Hmm… hmm… 

00:19:35
He can drink about eight to ten beers a night probably a couple of shots of tequila, and basically takes care of himself. 

00:19:45
BRADFORD KEENEY Does he change when he drinks, so become another person? 

00:19:45
Yeah, he does. At first, I didn't really notice it and I slowly… slowly caught on to it. 

00:19:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Then will you change when he changes? Does it create a change… 

00:19:55
Basically, I can ignore. I try to do the best I can, I have my routines when I come home, get her dinner, get her bath, you know what I mean (inaudible ) reading time with her, we spend a bit time with her and then I try to get her off to bed so at least I have some downtime for myself, which is really watching TV. I know I always been a big reader, but I've noticed that now I what are the things that I like to do, I put aside because it's so now we are two fighting every night, which I have to have in the schedule and have to have a schedule just happens to come up because I don't like living the way we've been living. I'm not happy with it. I can't ever seem to do anything right, I can't go grocery shop the right way, I can't take care of Casey the right way, I can't do anything right. 

00:20:40
BRADFORD KEENEY So, you're facing some real challenges? 

00:20:45
Yeah, I am. And I really seem to think that I'm a good mom, I mean I put her interest for that I put her first, I put her safety first, communication with her. You know I mean… I mean I can't even take basic phone call in the evening without him, can't you get off the phone to change her diaper, can't you do anything right, you're so fat you're stupid. I don’t think I should have to live like that, you know I mean so… 

00:21:10
BRADFORD KEENEY So where do things stand at this moment and let me ask you in a different… different way. If we would ask him where are things in the marriage and the family life, what would he, what do the kids say? 

00:21:20
He doesn't think like there's a problem. 

00:21:25
BRADFORD KEENEY So he says no problem. 

00:21:25
He says, basically the biggest problem is I don't obey him… I don’t obey him. 

00:21:30
BRADFORD KEENEY Would he say that… that you left him? 

00:21:30
Yeah he’d say that I left him. 

00:21:30
BRADFORD KEENEY So he'd say that you left him. 

00:21:35
He say that, he also would say that I don't touch him enough that our sex life is none and void due the fact that he think is because I'm fat, I thinks because he's drunk and the way in here today, he beeped me and he called me back and he said that I love and I want to make it work, but just his morning he told me my marriage is over with. So I walked around in tears all day thinking this is it, I really have to face a big challenge myself now. (inaudible ) changes his mind now. (inaudible ) I don't know what's going to happen, but it seems to be changing real fast. 

00:22:15
BRADFORD KEENEY So there's so many things going on, what do you think at the moment would be most useful for you in terms of focusing on something to… to help… help you sort out your life to make things better for you, what would that be? 

00:22:25
I don't know. I just, I've so much on my play right now. I feel… I feel like it's a drinking problem, then I feel like there's more to just drinking problem Frank's brother passed away. Excuse me. Two weeks after we were married. His brother was his best friend someone he'd cheer a lot with, who was very, very close with. He took his death very, very hard. 

00:22:50
BRADFORD KEENEY So, maybe this a three year wake. 

00:22:50
It could be a three year wake. He also said that his parents he was abused growing up that his father, and I witnessed his father he does not know how to respect people, he doesn't know how to talk to people. So I think part of it comes from that. He has never really learnt how to talk to a woman, I mean his dad talks down to his wife so, of course Frank only knows this and will talk down to me. I don't believe he wants to do it, I just believe he doesn't know the difference. Maybe I'm trying to be on his side not on his side, but I'm trying to hope that he doesn't really think that down upon me. I don't know. 

00:23:30
BRADFORD KEENEY Give a couple of wild ideas. 

00:23:35
Shoot him up. He can't help. 

00:23:35
BRADFORD KEENEY It seems there anywhere in the pathway. From what you've have said it's possible that you truly are not only a good mother, but an outstanding mother. 

00:23:50
Thank you. 

00:23:50
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes, that's part of the reason I think that you came here look how busy you are and you came in the midst of this probably largely because you do almost anything to help… help that child that you love, yeah. 

00:24:00
I do. I did (inaudible ) dinner already everything. 

00:24:06
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah, see. Then I think I'm on the right track there. 

00:24:10
Thank you. 

00:24:10
BRADFORD KEENEY Now, he obviously even though, he may not admit it, may be not even to himself but he down deep knows too that you are a great mother and probably in some deep level knows and is aware of the gifts that you bring to home life. So, maybe… maybe he has some inner desire to learn how to be different in the home than the way that he experienced as a kid. 

00:24:45
Hmm… hmm… 

00:24:45
BRADFORD KEENEY You know and in a sense, he's trying to get over may be two deaths this… this sort of recent, this death three years ago and like I say it sounds like a big wave just can't stop… stop that process, but there's also a sense he probably like to get out of the patterns that he grew up with. 

00:25:10
I will hope. 

00:25:10
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah, I mean who wouldn't? I mean some down deep you know that's… that's got to be some… some (inaudible ). 

00:25:17
I believe that it can partly be true because he often talks about how he wants to change and he often says he is not like his father. 

00:25:20
BRADFORD KEENEY Exactly. 

00:25:20
But he doesn't realize that he is but I don't know how to show him. 

00:25:25
BRADFORD KEENEY Well, see the trap is… is that people caught in this situation often have to act the way they did or act the way they saw their for parents acting to see what the spouse would do about it. He doesn't help for you to point that out because he'll say no I'm not and no you don't understand and and other times he'll say, yeah I don't want to be like my father. So you know he's aware that… that there is something there. So you are up against this challenge that in a way when he challenges you with his forms of let us say disrespect and when he challenges you with in particular the drinking he maybe in a way he's saying, look this is exactly what I don't want to be like. I’m showing you this is how I don’t want to be. You know it's a… it's a… it's a sort of a strange way to do it, but… but people were all strange, you know people just don't in other ways you know if we had a problem, people sit down and for 10 minutes say I don't want this, I want this and say okay, shake hands let's go off. That doesn't work for anyone. 

00:26:30
No. 

00:26:30
BRADFORD KEENEY Right? Otherwise we wouldn't have literature motion pictures and plays that show how complicated we make simple things into. 

00:26:40
Very true. 

00:26:40
BRADFORD KEENEY Okay. So, may be he's showing you how he doesn't want to be and hoping that you'll respond in a way that can help him break out of that. 

00:26:50
I thought my leaving would show to him that hasn't. 

00:26:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Okay. 

00:26:55
My understand now he's drinking more. He says that he is willing to quit drinking if the marriage works, but if the marriage does not work then why bother quit drinking. He asked to see his daughter. 

00:27:10
BRADFORD KEENEY Then what communication do you have with him? You said, you talked to him today. 

00:27:15
Basically… 

00:27:15
BRADFORD KEENEY You said in the phone or do you see? 

00:27:15
Oh, no actually, I give him… we've one kind of, I give my lights(ph) to the train in the morning and I think one of problems we're having, the more I think about this, it kind of person who loves to analyze, then with analyzing… 

00:27:30
BRADFORD KEENEY So you said, you're… 

00:27:30
Oh, I loved… Oh, yes me. Him? No, (inaudible ) what it means, but I don't think I think he literally does, but I would love to analyze, I've been analyzing the whole situation, I've been analyzing him, me, how I am, how everything and I partly… partly starting to wonder if maybe he's just doesn't, he's not grown up yet. He's 38-year-old man his parents are taking care of everything for him and if he is not, if they like ask him to do something and he is not, they say it's okay, he's 38 years old. 

00:27:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Hmm… hmm… 

00:28:00
Well, I was brought up in a household where you just faced every day as a challenge, we (inaudible ) to work, Frank is a fair kid, Frank doesn't go to work. How he's never lost his job I don't ever know I… I honestly do not know. He's had notes in home saying you only allowed one more day off and your job is gone and he pushes it every single time. 

00:28:20
BRADFORD KEENEY So this sort of confirms my hypothesis about you're being a good mother, it's something about you attracted him… 

00:28:25
Yeah. 

00:28:25
BRADFORD KEENEY …to find it maybe possible good mother and you're caught with a pattern of. 

00:28:35
I just I… I… I originally thought when we got married I… I… if I think back now, I did see drinking problem, but either A, I thought I could change it or B, I close my eyes to it. I don't know what's when I did, you know (inaudible ) maybe I did a little bit of both, I don’t know. 

00:28:55
BRADFORD KEENEY How was he like before the funeral three years ago? 

00:29:00
He was drinking, but he knew when to say when. We would talk and communicated, but if I think back it was always his way. If I think back, he was always… always an excuse for something now I moved out of the house, knew that I needed to talk to someone, knew that I didn't have a lot of money so I started going through the telephone book. I started talking to friends, talk to (inaudible ) some state representative and here I am today. 

00:29:25
BRADFORD KEENEY Okay, have you made a decision what you're gonna do or you still… 

00:29:30
Oh, no I haven't made any decisions. 

00:29:30
BRADFORD KEENEY So you're just really just wondering. 

00:29:30
But he hasn't even thought ain't(ph) even rent a car so do not have to take him to and from the train any morning or take him to the grocery store which I don't take him to grocery store or home from the… I used to take him to work to the train because I want him to go to work because I need that money right now. He said I don't know what's going to happen. I can't have him losing his job, you know I mean like he is… doesn't make really good money, my money is I don't know what happens to it… it goes to the babysitter actually, she makes (inaudible ) more than I do, but I like what I do, I work with handicapped people I totally get into that. 

00:30:05
BRADFORD KEENEY So everything in your life is being this wonderful mother. 

00:30:05
Well, I don't want to seem to put myself all up and push him down. 

00:30:10
BRADFORD KEENEY But you see the dilemma, can you see the dilemma that shaping itself up and clearly everything you say confirms my hypothesis that… that you have fabulous mothering skills working with handicapped people, the concern you have about your own daughter the… the ways in which I think he behaves are not only bringing a lot of pain and suffering to you, but in a crazy way, it's his way of… of acknowledging that you are a skilled mother, otherwise he wouldn't be present you a child like behavior. 

00:30:40
Maybe. 

00:30:45
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah, some most like saying, I see and (inaudible ) that you are this great mother let me throw all those childish stuff and you mother me through it, now the dilemma is you know thank you very much I'm glad you know but the dilemma is this is a mess. 

00:30:55
Yeah. 

00:30:55
BRADFORD KEENEY But can you see in some crazy way that it's… that's almost a top of… 

00:31:00
After you pointed out I can… I can see it or maybe the reason why we're together is maybe as I will help him to straighten out and turn to a man and (inaudible ). 

00:31:10
BRADFORD KEENEY It's bizarre because he is complimenting you when he behaves this way, complimenting your skill as a mother, but it… it's a very crazy way of doing it. And I would say in some way since you are very bent on being a keen analyst of things, let's put our thinking detective paths on because I think that possibly this business of the drinking starting at that… at that funeral like awake(ph) in some way has signaled that he wants part of this childish behavior of his own to go away, to die to pass. 

00:31:40
Yes, I think he does really do. 

00:31:45
BRADFORD KEENEY So (inaudible ) let's tie it together. 

00:31:46
I think he knows that he can't continue going on like this it's going to kill him. It really is going to kill him literally. So, I mean he doesn't eat healthier his idea of being dinner is like 9 o'clock at night at stake. My idea of eating dinner is 6 o'clock and whatever I can put together and (inaudible ) that's testable(ph) for her. 

00:32:06
BRADFORD KEENEY Okay. 

00:32:06
It's my trend of thinking. 

00:32:10
BRADFORD KEENEY So let's in an analytical sense assume that most if not all of this performance that he creates of being a 38-year-old, 15-year-old is basically a way of… of acknowledging your skill as a mother and that puts you in the trap that you can't be as mother. 

00:32:30
Yes that's very (inaudible ), very. 

00:32:31
BRADFORD KEENEY And then that leads to all kinds of the weird things that are also being experienced. So, let me ask you are there as there's even five minutes in a course of the week where you don't feel like a mother to him, were the two of you have… have a truly… 

00:32:40
No, there really isn't, there really is. 

00:32:45
BRADFORD KEENEY So, let’s think. What if you… if you could only create I don't know five minutes, 10 minutes maybe that's too ambitious, maybe one minute where that… where he did not relate to you as a… as a 38-year-old, 15-year-old and you did not really to him with your mothering skills, where the two of you not as equals in the way you did as a couple before you were married, before the funeral, before all this crazy wake, before all these things started to happen. What… what would it be, what could we create that it would just be a moment, is there anything? 

00:33:15
I don't know, but I… I do honestly miss not having him talk to. When we met, we thought we were soul mates, I still sometimes feel I could connect with him. We almost think… we could almost think for each other at times, it sounds very weird as much as I could (inaudible ) strangle him at times. I also feel like you know he is going to say, before he is going to say it. I don't know we didn't really date for very long, we only dated for six months before I married. 

00:33:40
BRADFORD KEENEY Where did you go for fun? Did you go to movies, did you go to restaurants, did you go bowling? 

00:33:45
A bar. 

00:33:45
BRADFORD KEENEY A bar? Anything else?. 

00:33:50
We used to take a walk, we used to live downtown about two blocks from like Michigan we used to get up in the morning and weekends and walk along the lake with cappuccino. 

00:33:55
BRADFORD KEENEY So walking and coffee. 

00:33:55
Yeah. Yes. 

00:34:00
BRADFORD KEENEY Okay. A bar. 

00:34:00
Yeah, bar was always fun for him and never for me. 

00:34:05
BRADFORD KEENEY Okay. So what you both liked was walking. 

00:34:05
And spending time with his brother was always very important to him. We would spend… we spend a lot of time with his brother before he… like between the time I met him and the time he died. 

00:34:15
BRADFORD KEENEY Hmm… hmm… 

00:34:15
We spent a lot of time up there. 

00:34:15
BRADFORD KEENEY So where do you live now, if you… if you were to go for a walk where would you go? Your place? 

00:34:20
Well, we can go the (inaudible ) walking path, we can go around the blocks, we can go almost everywhere. 

00:34:30
BRADFORD KEENEY And so, how much time do you have in a week or a day to have for walking? 

00:34:35
For my husband I can make time. I really could probably make time. 

00:34:40
BRADFORD KEENEY I don't want you to be too ambitious. 

00:34:45
A few times on Saturday we walk to the park, take Casey to the park and walkover to the dealer store, shouldn't really get out a lot when you have kids. You don't get it all when you have kids. Walkover to the video store and get a video for her, of course she can't (inaudible ) I get bunny in there and the video each that we both liked we watched videos and something like that I found that a very enjoyable day. 

00:35:05
BRADFORD KEENEY When is the last time you walked together? 

00:35:10
Couple of months. 

00:35:10
BRADFORD KEENEY When was the last time you watched a video tape together? 

00:35:15
We can't even sit down to watch a TV show together. I don't, I mean for some reason like we don't seem to have the same interests in TV as we did. When we were dating I guess you could say we're living together. 

00:35:30
BRADFORD KEENEY So, it would be quite an issue to decide which video tape to watch. 

00:35:35
But I also think it could also be that when we first met we didn't really watch TV or videos. We would go out and we would stay in and we would talk, keyword is talk. We spent a lot time communicating. 

00:35:45
BRADFORD KEENEY So the talking, the kind of talking is… 

00:35:50
The talking has gone. The talking has gone. 

00:35:50
BRADFORD KEENEY But when you walked it was present. 

00:35:50
Yeah. 

00:35:55
BRADFORD KEENEY What do you think he would he say if you just mentioned let's go and walk tomorrow? 

00:36:00
Well, probably say sweetheart (inaudible ) and he'd say you know what can you wait until Saturday, probably give me that excuse. 

00:36:10
BRADFORD KEENEY Would you do it on Saturday then, that would be another excuse? 

00:36:15
No, there won't be another excuse. 

00:36:15
BRADFORD KEENEY Do you think you have the skill to figure out how to get him on a walk? 

00:36:20
No. 

00:36:20
BRADFORD KEENEY You don't. Five minutes, one minute, (inaudible ), is there anything that you can do? 

00:36:30
I probably if I (inaudible ). 

00:36:31
BRADFORD KEENEY What would you have to do? 

00:36:35
I could approach it yet, maybe in order to make this marriage work we have to stop back remember what we used to like together when we first met and say why don't we take a walk instead of having a beer. 

00:36:50
BRADFORD KEENEY Okay. That's… and that's the way you probably would have asked him in the past years? 

00:36:55
Hmmm… hmmm… 

00:36:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Now I want you to turn on the imagination. 

00:37:00
Oh, oh. 

00:37:00
BRADFORD KEENEY Click it on. I want you to try to imagine how you could you ask him to take a walk in a way that would completely shock him? He would go like, what, did you say that? 

00:37:20
I'm a mother, okay. 

00:37:20
BRADFORD KEENEY How could you ask him for a walk that would shock him? How would you do it? I mean it could be weird, it could be mysterious, it could be a little crazy, it could be saying it with a word or with an idea? 

00:37:40
A gesture. 

00:37:40
BRADFORD KEENEY A gesture. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. 

00:37:45
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. 

00:37:50
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah, okay. Nice thing about pretend is that you can just make something up. I'm not asking what would work, just what… just what… what would do you think will shock him, you know? 

00:38:00
Probably nothing because I've shocked him so many times with all things. 

00:38:05
BRADFORD KEENEY So you're good at shocking? 

00:38:05
Oh, very good in shocking (inaudible ) says I am the queen of shock value. 

00:38:10
BRADFORD KEENEY Oh, really? And you're telling me now that you can't come up with another word I think you're holding back. 

00:38:15
And may be… (inaudible ) watching a Barney movies… (inaudible ) Barney… barney movies daily where it's just, I don't know. I don’t know. 

00:38:25
BRADFORD KEENEY How do you shocked him in the past? If you are the… if you are the master of shock. 

00:38:30
Probably just things I (inaudible ) things I've beeped into his beeper. 

00:38:35
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah. 

00:38:40
Yeah. 

00:38:40
BRADFORD KEENEY So, this is some… you are skilled at this. 

00:38:40
Oh, I'm very skilled at this. 

00:38:40
BRADFORD KEENEY I want to hear more about this. Tell me more about this ability to shock. What kind of things… what kind of things are shocking things in the beeper are they, things you could say? 

00:38:50
When my friends taught me how to put a code like figure out the number in the letter and put it on the beeper like if I was going to say I love you I would put the numbers for I love you and the letters for I love you, the numbers, I always get numbers almost confusing. For I love you, and then he call me back and he goes did you beep me I said, yes I beeped you. He said, what did you say, I go look at the phone and figure it out. 

00:39:20
BRADFORD KEENEY Ah… Code. 

00:39:20
It took about part of a… half hour, but he was like ah, I like this. 

00:39:25
BRADFORD KEENEY So when is the last time you exercised this communication? 

00:39:25
I did it today. I did that today. 

00:39:30
BRADFORD KEENEY And did he like it? 

00:39:30
He was very surprised. 

00:39:30
Scene(ph). 

00:39:30
This morning he called me and told me a work that he did not think this marriage was going to work. So this afternoon, with a tear in my eye I beeped that I so love you. 

00:39:40
BRADFORD KEENEY So you do have this special talent and resource of a… of shocking that's proven to be something wonderful for the relationship. 

00:39:55
Yeah. 

00:39:55
BRADFORD KEENEY So how would you… would you, I mean can you send a message to him that he would be able to figure out that you're inviting him for a walk? 

00:40:05
I hope I can do that. 

00:40:05
BRADFORD KEENEY Do. 

00:40:05
Of course, thinking down, sit down (inaudible ) I would be able to do that. 

00:40:10
BRADFORD KEENEY So that would be very interesting and maybe you can use that as a clue for how to talk to him about things that aren't so easy to talk about. May be you would come up with a special arrangement that… that sensitive issues are only to be addressed in code, you know I'm not sure exactly how you do it, I mean it's gonna take a lot of messages on the… on that machine, but… but you could arrange something, I'm sure you can do that with. After all your mother said, you're… you're master with this, yes? 

00:40:45
That's true. 

00:40:45
BRADFORD KEENEY So now we've hit… we've hit some interesting territory that is we have found a skill that you held back from telling me. That is you have this skill of shocking and you used it with him and it's been effective. Do you ever shock yourself? 

00:41:05
No. 

00:41:05
BRADFORD KEENEY Just others? 

00:41:05
No, just others. 

00:41:05
BRADFORD KEENEY Do you ever think about what it mean to shock yourself? 

00:41:10
No. I won't. 

00:41:10
BRADFORD KEENEY I don't know what that mean, but it might be an interesting thing for you to think about. 

00:41:15
I guess. 

00:41:15
BRADFORD KEENEY You know because you… you analyze things, yes? 

00:41:15
Yes. 

00:41:15
BRADFORD KEENEY Over and over? 

00:41:20
Yes. 

00:41:20
BRADFORD KEENEY So would it be a way to analyze things that would shock you like you could create out of your imagination, a shocking analyses. 

00:41:25
(inaudible ) I think I've done it before maybe. 

00:41:30
BRADFORD KEENEY Really? 

00:41:30
I can now make believe an actor. 

00:41:30
BRADFORD KEENEY Excellent. 

00:41:30
Pretend. 

00:41:30
BRADFORD KEENEY This is wonderful. This is such a valuable thing. Does it make you giggle or when you… when you make it a sort of wild explanation of things? Does it… does it make you, it's… it's your funny bone or is it? 

00:41:45
Maybe. 

00:41:45
BRADFORD KEENEY Is it that your weird bone? 

00:41:50
(inaudible ) weird bone. Maybe I don't think always as I don't laugh anymore like I used to laugh, I don't joke around anymore the way I used to joke around, maybe I really don't. 

00:42:00
BRADFORD KEENEY You know what I'm thinking you need to announce loudly and clearly that the shock is back into your life. Need to say it to yourself. I'm bring back the shock. The shock is back. 

00:42:15
The shock is back. 

00:42:20
BRADFORD KEENEY The shock is back. You know what… what plays itself out in my imagination is that little device I don't know you could still buy them, when I was a kid I used to have a little device as you would wind up and you would shake somebody's hand and you buzz them. Did you aware of that and that's truly a shock, right? Did you still make those? 

00:42:35
I don't know I really don't shop on trick stores, but I could probably look for one. 

00:42:40
BRADFORD KEENEY I bet there is one, it has to be they could not… cannot be extinct. It has to be out there, but what a wonderful way to announce to the family and to your husband that the shock is back. 

00:42:50
The shock is back. I'm back. 

00:42:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Did you play practical tricks, did you go to trick shops in the past and get things like that or… or is that said something you did not explore. 

00:43:05
I have done little things like that where I've hidden things from him make him go on maze to find things. 

00:43:10
BRADFORD KEENEY Really? 

00:43:10
He has (inaudible ) me too though like Christmas presents are always hidden somewhere with little notes that I have to collecting them to figure out. 

00:43:20
BRADFORD KEENEY That's fantastic, that's fantastic. So you all have a lot of knowledge that other couples would benefit upon it. 

00:43:25
I guess so. 

00:43:25
BRADFORD KEENEY You can figure out this mothering and wake business get past that. 

00:43:30
If we can get passed all that. 

00:43:30
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah. Yeah that's fascinating. It's like treasure hunts. 

00:43:35
Yeah, treasure hunts. 

00:43:35
BRADFORD KEENEY Oh that's excellent. So you willing to announce that the shock is back? 

00:43:45
Yes, I probably could do that. Yes. 

00:43:45
BRADFORD KEENEY It would make sense for you to put it up a sign in the house? 

00:43:50
No. 

00:43:50
BRADFORD KEENEY That's too much, it's not shocking you know. 

00:43:50
That's too much. 

00:43:50
BRADFORD KEENEY So you got to say it to yourself. 

00:43:55
I've said it to myself a few times (inaudible ) shock is back. 

00:43:57
BRADFORD KEENEY The shock is back and you had to start giving little codes. May be that first code would be to get him take a walk, but you… but you can't. See the thing about shock, I'm assuming that that's when you are not a mother. 

00:44:10
No. 

00:44:10
BRADFORD KEENEY So you're not a mother when your shocking. 

00:44:10
That's true. 

00:44:10
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah, so your great mother and you are a great shocker and this relationship needs more shock that's where I want to sleep. 

00:44:20
It sounds like it. 

00:44:20
BRADFORD KEENEY On your part. 

00:44:20
Yes. 

00:44:20
BRADFORD KEENEY Your part, I mean he's still in the wake and you forgot and you left the shock. 

00:44:30
I've been so busy trying to hold everything together and make sure everything runs the right way Monday to Friday (inaudible ) Saturday comes I'm like, what? Huh? 

00:44:40
BRADFORD KEENEY And you know how you know that you have brought the shock back, at the end of the day you'll be able remember the times that you laughed, you've already told me that. Laughing… laughing has gone away and… and put this together. It seems to me you'll know at the end of each day by being able to remember that I laughed, I giggled you know and I was tickled in these way, but the shock is back. Okay. 

00:45:05
Thank you. 

00:45:05
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah, I mean I think you've simple laid out this fantastic gift, this that you have that your family knows about it, your mom knows it. 

00:45:15
Oh, yeah. My mom would. 

00:45:15
BRADFORD KEENEY Have you ever… you said that he also does a little trickery with you in terms of the treasure and so the gifts and the two of you together ever shocked somebody? 

00:45:30
No, I don't think we ever have. 

00:45:30
BRADFORD KEENEY Now that would be an experience. 

00:45:35
That would be. 

00:45:35
BRADFORD KEENEY Who with the… What person in the world would both of enjoy shocking? He would agree, you would agree? 

00:45:45
Hmm… I don't know I think Casey is still too younger to really benefit from it. 

00:45:50
BRADFORD KEENEY Probably so. Who would the two of just give the biggest charge, biggest giggle if you truly together shocked them? 

00:46:05
Maybe one of his nephews. 

00:46:05
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah, nephew would he agree? So that's the best target. 

00:46:10
I'm thinking it could be. 

00:46:15
BRADFORD KEENEY You see, maybe we need to get in the mind back… mind set of a secret intelligence operation. 

00:46:30
Some team work again. 

00:46:30
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes. You and your mind make clear that shock is back. Get him a code to go on a walk with the purpose of the walk is for the two of you to plot together a shock of someone both of you enjoy shocking. 

00:46:50
No, maybe our sister-in-law, oh it's his sister-in-law Alison. 

00:46:55
BRADFORD KEENEY You really shocked her what he (inaudible )? 

00:46:57
Yeah, I think (inaudible ). 

00:47:00
BRADFORD KEENEY Okay so that's… that's… that's when he know it has worked and you both, there's a giggle out of both of you. 

00:47:05
Maybe I will laugh a (inaudible ). 

00:47:06
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah. 

00:47:06
(inaudible ) was left again (inaudible ). 

00:47:11
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah. 

00:47:11
That we could probably do. 

00:47:15
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah, very interesting… very interesting. Yeah, but again I think it's good. I don't think you should forget about that little buzzer, little buzzer, yeah. And that might be nice way when you both agreed on that walk to do this shock, that you say let's shake fizz again buzzes out and he would be shocked, yeah? 

00:47:40
Yes, he would be shocked. He'd be very shocked. 

00:47:40
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah. 

00:47:40
He'd be shocked. 

00:47:45
BRADFORD KEENEY He could even after he's buzzed him just take it and go, toss it to the water because you'd be walking by water right? Yeah so just toss it in the water, and really it should be a double shock. 

00:47:55
Yeah, I could try that, I could probably try that. 

00:48:00
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah. 

00:48:00
(inaudible ) work and I don't know, but I could definitely try it. 

00:48:05
BRADFORD KEENEY Then you… then you… then you say now it's really shaking. Again stop with one I think he's (inaudible ). 

00:48:11
Exactly. 

00:48:11
BRADFORD KEENEY And then you say the shock is back. Yeah that would be a good time to say it. You think, but you need a moment like that to announce it. 

00:48:20
That's true. 

00:48:20
BRADFORD KEENEY Otherwise its bad… it's bad theater, you're right, you can't just say it. The audience won't believes it. You got to set it up. 

00:48:30
That's true. 

00:48:30
BRADFORD KEENEY Got to set it up. 

00:48:30
That's very, very true. 

00:48:35
BRADFORD KEENEY Well, I think there's hope in your life. 

00:48:35
I hope. 

00:48:35
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah. 

00:48:35
I pray. 

00:48:40
BRADFORD KEENEY Because… because I mean how can you… how can you not get through life having the skill of analysis and skill of shocking. 

00:48:45
That's very true. 

00:48:45
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah those were two amazing tools. Wow, and every… every human being had that there would be greater hope for the world. 

00:48:55
That's true. 

00:48:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Just think of the world leaders had those things. They don't know how to shock anybody. 

00:49:00
That's very true. 

00:49:00
BRADFORD KEENEY I think that's probably why the the world is on a mess. A little more shock you know. 

00:49:05
Exactly. 

00:49:05
BRADFORD KEENEY Little more laughter. 

00:49:10
A lot more laughter. 

00:49:10
BRADFORD KEENEY Oh, we need it. 

00:49:10
Hmm… hmm… Exactly, yeah. 

00:49:15
BRADFORD KEENEY So will you… will you promise me that the shock will be back? 

00:49:20
I'll try, yes. 

00:49:25
BRADFORD KEENEY It's not good enough. 

00:49:25
I'll try. 

00:49:25
BRADFORD KEENEY It's not good enough because I'm assuming you came here really worried and then you tell me you have this talent and I… I really, I mean I want you to make it up, but I really want to hear, yes the shock is back. And let's just say, can I come back for one week and you… and you say to me the shock is back for at least one week? Can you make that promise? 

00:49:55
One whole week. 

00:49:55
BRADFORD KEENEY One whole week. 

00:49:55
Seven whole days? 

00:49:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah, I don't know I'm not saying to shock 24 hours a day, but at least for the… at least for one week in your mind you're going to have a little voice is heard, yeah you're gonna be applauding, you're gonna do the code thing with him to say let's have a walk, have the walk, you're going to plot the shock to someone you both agree on and then to feel better, you know orchestrate all that. Let's just give a week. Can you… can you promise me that? 

00:50:25
Yes, I can promise you that. 

00:50:25
BRADFORD KEENEY That's okay. You're not just trying to shock me. 

00:50:30
No, I'm not. No, I will try it. I really, I feel like I have to give it (inaudible )before it give(ph) it quits. 

00:50:36
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah, I mean you've got to try that which you know has been a resource for you throughout your whole life. You can't stand in the face of adversity and not use the tools you have. Whatever happens to you however the form of your relationship because he's always going to be the father to your daughter. No matter what the outcome, whether sickness comes, whether or a climatic disaster comes or the financial ruin or the other kind of disasters you know sweep stakes, you win the sweep stakes and all these people converge on you, you know great success and great failure of both calamities. 

00:51:15
That's true. 

00:51:15
BRADFORD KEENEY So whatever life brings to you, you have to grow(ph) up on the skills that… that were given to you, that's your gift. So really doesn't(ph) matter what happens, what matters is that you use what you've got. 

00:51:30
True. 

00:51:30
BRADFORD KEENEY And you are not using them. 

00:51:30
I've not been using it at all. 

00:51:30
BRADFORD KEENEY So just promise me you'll use the gifts that you were born with. 

00:51:35
I could yes, I will do that. 

00:51:35
BRADFORD KEENEY That's it. 

00:51:35
Yes, I would do that. 

00:51:40
BRADFORD KEENEY Then I'm going to… I'm going to feel very good that there's a human being out there in the world who not only can analyze and make sense of things about who's a master at shocking because this is an endangered species. 

00:51:55
Yes. 

00:51:55
BRADFORD KEENEY You know, very few, few people with that skill left and it gives me hope for the future to know that there's one person exercising it. Okay. 

00:52:05
Thank you. 

00:52:05
BRADFORD KEENEY Thank you Good luck. 

00:52:10
Thank you. 

00:52:10
BRADFORD KEENEY I was sort of wondering that you're gonna buzz me. 

00:52:15
No, (inaudible ) I don't have anything. No tricks in my pocket yet. 

00:52:20
[sil.] 

00:52:25
JON CARLSON Brad is this is a good example of the type of therapy that you practice? 

00:52:30
BRADFORD KEENEY What I like about the case is it shows that therapy can take place by simply listening to what the client brings to you and suggesting that they utilize their own natural resources. 

00:52:40
JON CARLSON And… and every one comes in with both strengths and weakness into the therapy session? 

00:52:45
BRADFORD KEENEY Absolutely. They bring the resources they already can draw up on to move their life forward. 

00:52:50
JON CARLSON And it seems like too much of traditional approaches focus on what's wrong and trying to highlight how you screwed up, why your life didn't work. 

00:53:00
BRADFORD KEENEY I mean this what the client already brings, the client is already stuck in recycling their past psychic karma if you wish their own biography in terms of their pathology problems impasses suffering has been recycled in their in… internal dialogue as well as conversation with friends, professionals it had so much of that they had forgotten and have lost touch with their own inner resources so my job is simply to pay attention to what they bring that they can draw upon as a positive resource in their own life. 

00:53:30
JON CARLSON And then helping them to write a different story a different script for how they do things? 

00:53:35
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes to say your story also includes these wonderful delightful surprises that come into your life that can be drawn upon to help you move forward. 

00:53:45
JON CARLSON Well we’re going to watch a clip and might some clips from the video we just… just saw and the first clip we are going to look at is about three minutes into the video and this is where you begin to identify the positive, it's all that early lets watch it. 

00:54:00
BRADFORD KEENEY Great. 

00:54:05
BRADFORD KEENEY So you really want to be a good mother and do the right thing. 

00:54:05
Yeah, he seems to think that I want to be a mother more than I want to be wife, which I don’t really think is true, it’s just like I’ve had that role. 

00:54:15
JON CARLSON What… what was going on what did you see at this point in time and what are you hoping to do with this good mother when you don’t know she is a good mother. 

00:54:25
BRADFORD KEENEY Well here is a woman whose has come and her whole body, her tonality, her content and the discourse she presents is laying this present crises on us, that things aren’t going well she doesn’t know what to do and I’m looking for any possible direction that can steer us toward her resource and obviously she has mentioned her concern about her daughter which we can utilize and reframe as showing concern for this child to come and so this becomes my first effort to lay down a building block toward drawing her into reality an experience where she can again be in touch with her own positive resources. Her own natural resources. 

00:55:10
JON CARLSON So you make kind of a leap from I’m concerned about my daughter to I’m a good parent. 

00:55:20
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes and your always making an hypotheses, an assumption, intuition about what… what might be able to lead this conversation toward her having an acceptance that yes I also bring in with me something that’s resourceful, something that’s useful, something that’s positive and… and we see that she… she accepts this and now we have laid down a foundational block and we’ll look to build other blocks and then when we have a number of these resources we’d attempt to weave them together and then the total weave of this complex creates a therapeutic context. A therapeutic experience now she carries her own resource, she can drop on herself. 

00:56:05
DIANE KJOS So you’ve something you’re building something to… to… to build on to use as yours. 

00:56:10
BRADFORD KEENEY Precisely. 

00:56:10
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

00:56:15
BRADFORD KEENEY So I hold this in my mind very clearly working for laying down these foundational pieces or these building blocks or these metaphors all which point toward or underscore or make very explicit, this is what you carry that’s resourceful and then we weave those together. So that one is woven inside this therapeutic context. 

00:56:35
DIANE KJOS So we watch that mother (inadible ) through here. 

00:56:37
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes. 

00:56:40
DIANE KJOS See how you use it. 

00:56:40
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah. 

00:56:40
JON CARLSON Many over troubled people you know they come to us with their problems they want to stay rooted in the past, they want to talk about how this happened how that didn’t work, how they are victimized by this, in this next clip we are going to watch you stay in the present and move towards the future. 

00:56:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah. 

00:57:00
And that we (inaudible ) today he beeped me and I called him back and he said that I love and I want to make it work, but just his morning he told me my marriage is over with. So I walked around in tears all day thinking this is it. I really have to face a big challenge by myself now. Not only I’m here and he changes his mind now, but to my mind I don’t know what’s going to happen, but he seems to be changing real fast. 

00:57:25
BRADFORD KEENEY So there’s so many things going on what do you think at the moment would be most useful for you in terms of focusing on something to… to help… help you sort out your life and to make things better for you, what would that be? 

00:57:40
I don’t know. I just, I’ve so much on my play right now I feel… I feel like it’s a drinking problem then I feel like there’s more to just drinking problem Franks’ brother passed away, Excuse me, two weeks after we were married and his brother was his best friend, someone he’d cheer a lot with, he was very, very close with. He took his death very, very hard. 

00:58:05
BRADFORD KEENEY So maybe this a three year wake. 

00:58:05
It could be three year wake. He also… 

00:58:10
JON CARLSON Yes, you watch this what’s going on inside of you when you think about her situation. 

00:58:15
BRADFORD KEENEY Well your are correct in pointing out that we are steering it toward the present experiences and her present understanding and conceptualization particularly this presenting plan of her husband's drinking but what’s fascinating is she says that this really begins when… when this family death took place that begins for me to trigger the possibility of laying another building block, which is the idea that perhaps this is awake that he is still in that process of grieving trying to let something go and of course that’s another metaphor for change. Something to drop on as a resource. So that is presented and we see that we can utilize that as the therapy progresses. 

00:59:10
DIANE KJOS So then his depression isn’t permanent it's just part of a process, always drinking... 

00:59:15
BRADFORD KEENEY Right, it becomes naturalized he’s in something natural although a bit crazy because it's going on for three years and we are going to see as the case progress how this ties and to her skills as a mother. Someone who just needs a little help to get out of this pattern and so the notion of awake drinking may be a way of not only getting past the death of a loved one but hope… hopefully getting past the patterns that have been disruptive and dysfunctional and not resourceful in his own family origin and in his present relationship with his wife. 

00:59:55
JON CARLSON There’s a lot there, there’s a lot of different things you could have focused on there… 

01:00:00
BRADFORD KEENEY But the key, the key is to… to go for that which can take you toward resourcefulness. It can take you toward healing, it can take you toward empowering her to drop on a different way of conceptualizing the situation that gives forth options that are more than simply being stuck in a hopeless situation and in this sense it may appear on surface to be a positive therapy but I would suggest that it’s a resourceful therapy because that’s a more positive way of… of connoting this… this… this notion. 

01:00:30
DIANE KJOS And… and the other direction I mean that one might have taken because she is the one who comes in for therapy is how, what… how do you think you are contributing to this, or what’s your role in this in other words because I’m… I'm sure she carries a certain amount of that. 

01:00:45
BRADFORD KEENEY What’s important is that we keep it in the relational feel. 

01:00:50
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:00:50
BRADFORD KEENEY That we not isolate her as separate from the relational context. So we attending to all the players which now embrace not only their relationship but his relationship to his own family I want to change so we are going to widen that to always maintain a social ecology, to never forget that to not treat someone in vitro(ph), isolated from the context of relationships that define their life and their experiences. Yes there are many ways in which we could go after the relational aspects of in the relational organization but in the idea that... or her suggestion that this drinking and problem began with that death to me was the trigger. 

01:01:35
JON CARLSON Hmm… hmm… 

01:01:40
BRADFORD KEENEY And… and so it was a quick leap to reframe that as awake because that is none pathological way of connoting this behavior, creates an opening now because if it is pathological, you always face the possibility of… of rigidifying the context and her understanding of it and by definition it means I can't change this, it's hopeless if… if you truly is hardened addict to… to addict to alcohol and all the kinds of hopelessness that she may be connoting with that then it’s a lot more difficult for her to mobilize any different way of… of participation in this relation ecology, but if it’s awake then she is good mother now we start to have a sense of there might be new possibilities for this couple, how to understand and how to interact and not only with themselves but in their whole family ecology. 

01:02:35
JON CARLSON Well in this next clip you are going to continue to probe for possibilities and redevelop this good mother thing lets watch how you do that. 

01:02:45
BRADFORD KEENEY You are not only a good mother but an outstanding mother. 

01:02:50
Thank you. 

01:02:50
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes, that’s part of the reason I think that you came here look how busy you are and you came in the midst of this probably largely because you do almost anything to help… help that child that you love yeah. 

01:03:00
I do I did (inaudible ) dinner already everything. 

01:03:06
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah see. Then I think I’m on the right track here. 

01:03:10
Thank you. 

01:03:10
BRADFORD KEENEY Now he obviously even though he may not admit it may be not even to himself that he down deep knows too that you are a great mother and probably in some deep level knows and is aware of the gifts that you bring to home life. So maybe… maybe he has some inner desire to learn how to be different in the home than the way that he experienced as a kid. 

01:03:45
Hmm… hmm. 

01:03:45
BRADFORD KEENEY You know and in sense he is trying to get over may be two deaths this… this sort of recent this death three years ago and like you say it sounds like a big wake just can't stop… stop that process but there’s also a sense he probably like to get out of the pattern then he grew up with. 

01:04:10
I have hope. 

01:04:10
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah, I mean who wouldn’t I mean some down deep you know that’s… that's got to be some… some… 

01:04:15
I agree they could partly be true because he often talks about how he wants to change and he often says he is not like his father. 

01:04:20
BRADFORD KEENEY Exactly. 

01:04:25
JON CARLSON Talk about what you’re doing at this point in time with her. 

01:04:30
BRADFORD KEENEY Now we are using the metaphor of the wake as an opening to continue to re-contextualize the drinking in two ways, one to… to see that perhaps the drinking is awake also in the desire to let go, of past dysfunctional past less resourceful patterns but we’re linking this drinking behavior to her mothering and in a varying specific way that we will see and this moves us forward, moves us forward to giving her new possibilities again how to understand and how to participate in her relationship with her husband. 

01:05:25
JON CARLSON I wonder though by developing her as a good mother does that mean he has to be a son? 

01:05:30
BRADFORD KEENEY Well there is this obvious implication and that’s something which both he and will rebel against at the say… and this is… this is the paradox of it that as he behaves in a... in an adolescent way on the one hand is a compliment to her as a… as a good mother acknowledging in some kind of strange mysterious, paradoxical, indirect unconscious way that here I present to you that which I’ve never been able to outgrow in a faulty family background. And exercise your mothering with me at the same time that leads them into an… an impossible situation, as they can't relate to one another in a satisfactory way to adults that has two marital, two members of a marriage. But we’re identifying what has been a paradoxical possibility or the realization of a paradox which then she can on the… the one hand see oh you know this is not what I've thought that it meant that in fact this is a way that acknowledges my own skill as a mother, yet its driving me crazy, I must change and… and you’ll see that very slippery ambiguous in that definition because I don’t want to get too vigorous and too specific of a definition of how this behavior elevates her as a mother or acknowledges her mothering or how it has anything to do with awake which is gently moving around those themes as we see how she will respond to it and then and the back and forth see how it moves us toward a redefinition of the situation again as a… as a… as possibility for drawing upon resources. 

01:07:30
JON CARLSON I was really impressed with the changes in her already she came in very heavy very almost dead depressed and she so much of a high now she is very attentive, very focused and fishing terms you have hooked her. 

01:07:50
BRADFORD KEENEY Truly as a testimony to the… to the history of psychotherapy that words can be medicine and we hear so much about the medicalisation of peoples difficulties and that you know it’s the inner biochemistry that must be encountered with and altered and… and here you see someone coming in with… with such hopelessness and immobility and… and if you… if you as you know sitting here in the room we could just feel it the atmosphere was like oh this is one of the classic cases the therapist goes what can I do with this, what can I possibly do and… and yet through simply being attentive to the metaphors of the words the possibilities that she presents that might take us toward a realization of her resourcefulness soon as you touch that there’s dramatic change, and this is just. 

01:08:45
DIANE KJOS Yeah so this is going to touching on the what a… what a you know sad and awful time you are having you… you go and touch about what a great mother you are. 

01:08:50
BRADFORD KEENEY Exactly. 

01:08:50
DIANE KJOS And immediately this. 

01:08:55
BRADFORD KEENEY See even if we had a good heart and did… did… did the right thing. 

01:08:55
DIANE KJOS This is very empathic. 

01:08:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Empathic thing and so tell me how you saw, so how does it feel and… and… and to draw further history I mean three, four, five, six sessions in history even though we may in our heart desire to have great understanding so as to then mobilize our therapeutic resourcefulness what we do is during all of that time keep her in a context and we further rigidify, concretize the pathologizing the non-resourcefulness, the connotations of suffering and impossibility of her situation whereas any direction that might take us toward having a fresh new possibility of finding a way that she can think yes there… there are possibilities within myself that… that I’ve just given, I’ve… I've had amnesia and since clients come to us with amnesia towards those parts of themselves that can… that can be utilized to evolve their… their own lives and so we are trying to awake them out so maybe every I would say that perhaps my approach has one psychiatric diagnoses that everybody I see I assume has amnesia, they have amnesia for their own inner strengths and resources. 

01:10:10
JON CARLSON Under… under utilization of resources. 

01:10:15
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes. 

01:10:15
JON CARLSON To get a number to go with that you know we can put in our insurance forms. 

01:10:20
BRADFORD KEENEY Fantastic. 

01:10:20
JON CARLSON And this is brief therapy you know this is one of your few minutes into the interview and… and… and overall interview is less than 40 minutes long and we can already see what I… what I call movement occurring. 

01:10:35
BRADFORD KEENEY And it's also not problem focused in the sense that if we were to say tell me more specifically and draw me a clear picture of a particular problem either in behavior terms or its embeddedness in an interactional sequence we would be doing what still staying in the context and adding further frames that concretize her presence in that nor is it solution focused as if you imply solutions if you talk solutions you imply problems and we will see as the case moves forward and even ends we move away from this being about solving anything or this is about understanding problems instead we are mobilizing her to be awakened to the natural resources she carries to utilize no matter what life presents her. 

01:11:25
JON CARLSON But it's also not Pollyanna focus either. 

01:11:30
BRADFORD KEENEY Precisely that’s why… that’s why I hesitate to call her positive, I suppose call it resourceful because we all carry resources and that doesn’t mean we have to put a false smile and sing I’m singing in the you know singing in the rain everyday and… and when the bombs fall and so forth, that’s still the human condition does include suffering and it includes all these dilemmas that touch everyone and what we must remind and awaken our clients is that they carry a good number of tools with them, they wouldn’t be here they wouldn’t have survived. They wouldn’t have managed to come and sit in front of us and so we are awakening their inner tools their strength so that they can get on with their life. 

01:12:10
JON CARLSON Lets move on to another clip and the next clip we have you continue to focus on being a good mother and you also focus of the fact that she is a teacher of handicapped children, lets watch this. 

01:12:25
BRADFORD KEENEY Okay. 

01:12:25
She makes more than I do, but I like what I do, I work with handicapped people I totally get into that. 

01:12:30
BRADFORD KEENEY So everything in your life is being this wonderful mother. 

01:12:35
Well I don’t want to seem to put myself all up and put him down. 

01:12:40
BRADFORD KEENEY But you see, but you see the dilemma. Can you see the dilemma that is shaping itself up and clearly everything you say confirms my hypothesis that… that you have fabulous mothering skills working with handicapped people the concern you have about your own daughter the… the ways in which I think he behaves are not only bring a lot of pain and suffering to you but in a crazy way it's his way of… of acknowledging that you are a skilled mother, otherwise he wouldn’t present you a child like behavior. 

01:13:10
Maybe. 

01:13:10
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah it’s almost like saying I see in some level that you are this great mother, let me throw all this childish stuff and you mother me through it, now the dilemma is you know thank you very much I am glad that you know but the dilemma is this is a mess. 

01:13:25
Yeah. 

01:13:25
BRADFORD KEENEY But can you see in some crazy way that it’s almost a… 

01:13:25
After pointing it out I can… I can see it or may be the reason why we are together is maybe I will help him straighten out and turn to a man and let him out. 

01:13:35
BRADFORD KEENEY Its bizarre because he is complimenting you when he behaves this way, complimenting your skills as a mother, but a it’s a very crazy way of doing it and I would say in some way since you I’ve already been told you’re being a keen analyst of things, let’s put our thinking detective paths on because I think that possibly this business of the drinking starting at that… at that funeral like a wake in some ways a signal that he wants part of this childish behavior as his own to go away, to die to pass. 

01:14:10
Yes I think he does really do. 

01:14:15
JON CARLSON As I listen to this segment and watch them I’m picturing this truck pulling up in front her house with the Bradford Keeney construction company I understand. I’ve seen you use these tools. 

01:14:25
BRADFORD KEENEY I already had a hard hat. 

01:14:25
JON CARLSON I already hard hat it in the whole… the whole thing as you are constructing a new world for her, you are reframing her predicament for lack of better… better words. 

01:14:35
BRADFORD KEENEY That’s a nice image and I want to also be mindful that what underlies this way of working because indeed there is a sense of lets… lets join this construction crew and let's build for you a therapeutic way a resourceful way of living your life, however what I’m carrying with me is one central idea and it's an idea that comes from many philosophical traditions and it even comes from the theoretical orientation I was originally trained in that of cybernetic epistemology which is a big word that includes one central idea that any metaphor any idea is always one half of a greater distinction. So it I say love it implies hate if I say absence it implies presence, if I say sickness it implies health, so everything I hear… I hear as only half of a larger relational structure so when I hear someone say here’s this terrible symptoms, here’s the this terrible problem its causing all of this suffering and all of these difficulties. I say yes that’s the visible side but they will be implied another side to it that the symptoms this problem is somehow an adaptation somehow a contribution, somehow masking something that’s working including something that could be seen as resourceful, so everything has this implied other that is not see but it's there, it is present in the room, it's not spoken so that there is not so much guessing like just out of clear blue sky where this connotation or this frame its… its… it's just assuming that there is another side to anything uttered and in that way you’re bringing forth the invisible the unspoken which is already present and when that comes forth we now use those as building blocks put on hard hats get out there the tools and we put this together and you are out in construction because you have pieces. 

01:16:45
DIANE KJOS See her acknowledge that I mean it's like your right that’s what I mean there is this very clear identification... 

01:16:55
BRADFORD KEENEY yes. 

01:16:55
DIANE KJOS ...response on her part. 

01:16:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes in a sense she is saying yes these building blocks are present they’ve been in my home, they are in my life, I acknowledge that there are now here I’ve forgotten but you know he is still… they… they are here, now we have to do more than just have the blocks. 

01:17:10
DIANE KJOS Right. 

01:17:10
BRADFORD KEENEY We have to start to move these things together and we have to stack them together we have to build a wall with the building an entire frame so that this thing becomes as closure so that it is woven together and has a richness and texture and complexity that enables it to be full reality to be fully a contextualization of her life not just a piece otherwise you will have I live in this terrible pathological nightmare and I have a few things that might help, no that’s not therapeutic you have to say I live in this resourceful context and there are things that are here are problematic, that’s the… that's flip, that’s you wanting the ideal session is… is… is typically it… it comes in with the context this is impossible it’s problematic its filled with symptoms, I’m stuck, its hopeless and what you want to do is not change the fact all the same facts all the same pieces by turn it upside down so this is a context were I have plenty of tools and resources to draw upon no matter what happens and this is bigger than reframe this reframe we tend to think as a small, so we’re reframing connotations but maybe its not so much reframing as it is bringing forth the implied other side of the distinction and that’s… that's there is an old Japanese proverb for every truth the opposite is also true. So that is an operating premises in… in all the therapeutic encounters that… that… that I work in. 

01:18:50
JON CARLSON Lets watch this next clip were you continue to develop this idea of resourcefulness and try to put it in a context and keep it in the context that's you saw for her but we’d particularly watch the way you build in this piece. 

01:19:00
BRADFORD KEENEY Okay. 

01:19:05
Also be then when we first met we didn’t really watch TV or videos. 

01:19:05
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah. 

01:19:10
We would go out and we would stay and we would talk, key word is talk. We spent a lot time communicating. 

01:19:15
BRADFORD KEENEY So the talking is. 

01:19:15
The talking has gone… 

01:19:15
BRADFORD KEENEY The talking has gone. 

01:19:20
The talking has gone. 

01:19:20
BRADFORD KEENEY When you walked it was present. 

01:19:20
Yeah. 

01:19:25
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah what do you think he would he say if you just mentioned lets go and walk tomorrow. 

01:19:30
Well probably say his feet hurt he is complaining about his gym shoes slightly and he’d say you know what can you wait until Saturday, probably give me that excuse. 

01:19:40
BRADFORD KEENEY Would you do it on Saturday then, that would be another excuse. 

01:19:45
Now would be another excuse. 

01:19:45
BRADFORD KEENEY Do you think you have the skill to figure out how to get him on a walk? 

01:19:50
No. 

01:19:50
BRADFORD KEENEY You don’t. Five minutes one minute would you trick him is there anything that you can do? 

01:19:55
I probably if I tried really hard I could. 

01:20:00
BRADFORD KEENEY What would you have to do? 

01:20:05
I could approach it maybe in order to make this marriage work we have to stop back and remember what we used to like together when we first met and say why don’t we take a walk instead of having a beer. 

01:20:20
BRADFORD KEENEY Okay that's… that's the way you probably would have asked him in the past years? 

01:20:25
Hmmm… hmmm. 

01:20:25
BRADFORD KEENEY Now I want you to turn on your imagination. 

01:20:30
Oh, oh. 

01:20:30
BRADFORD KEENEY Take it on. I want you to try to imagine how you could you ask him to take a walk in a way that would completely shock him, he would go like what, did you say that. 

01:20:50
I’m a mother Okay. 

01:20:50
BRADFORD KEENEY How could you ask him for a walk that would shock him? How would you do it? I mean it could be weird it could be mysterious, it could be a little crazy, it could be saying it with a word or with an idea. 

01:21:10
A gesture. 

01:21:10
BRADFORD KEENEY A gesture. Yeah that good. Yeah. 

01:21:10
I don’t know… I don’t know… I don’t know. 

01:21:20
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah oh nice thing about pretend is that's you can just make something up, I’m not asking how it would work, just what… just what… what would do you think would shock him you know. 

01:21:30
Probably nothing because I’ve shocked him so many times with all things. 

01:21:35
BRADFORD KEENEY So you are good at shocking. 

01:21:35
Oh very good in shocking. My mother says I am the queen of shock value. 

01:21:40
BRADFORD KEENEY Oh really. 

01:21:40
JON CARLSON When all else fails shock therapy. I… I… I just love this piece here you, to see her laugh and to get all excited, you suggest that she use her own imagination and shock where did this come from? 

01:22:00
BRADFORD KEENEY Well first of all you couldn’t do this in the beginning of the session I mean logically why didn’t you start there. 

01:22:05
JON CARLSON I’m surprise you could do it in the middle. 

01:22:10
BRADFORD KEENEY Because… because in the beginning she was hopeless so any suggestion of positive action or change she would negate because the context is about nothing can work in this, but we have already established very firmly her competence, now she is in a context as not a helpless person, a competent person, a mother… mother to solve problems. She when reminded in this… this conversation at the end but I’m a mother. 

01:22:35
JON CARLSON Sure. 

01:22:35
BRADFORD KEENEY So… so that we now have her in the scaffolding of her context that is resourceful and we can suggest a possibility for a change in the realm that she says in the past has been resourceful, namely they’re having walks and conversations and when we see her reject any hope for things that have logically worked in the past for mobilizing him to have a walk I see this as good. And I want to play that out so it exhaust in our conversation her hope drawing upon what she has tried in the past to do and… and so when this won't work only five minutes, no one minute no how would you ask it, well I would say with that worked? No probably not I’m… I'm tracking this and wanting to run it into a reductive (inaudible ) until she finally says... 

01:23:30
DIANE KJOS Hey, no way. 

01:23:30
BRADFORD KEENEY No… no way and that’s the door that opens now we can, that’s the door where we can now knock on imagination if you suggest imagination too early the logical mind tend to say, but you know you are being ridiculous I should say ask this and say that. Once you let that logical mind and its habits and patterns extinguish itself by reducing it through her playing it out saying that won't work… that won't work, that won't work stops now let's knock on the door of imagination and that door has many names it could be let’s be creative it can be let’s be silly, let’s absurd, let’s be exotic, lets be magical, let’s be shocking, let's be whatever I did not have a clue why I chose the metaphor shock. 

01:24:20
DIANE KJOS That’s what I wonder you know how did you know to say shock. 

01:24:25
JON CARLSON This is dumb luck. 

01:24:25
BRADFORD KEENEY Well I think its… it's definitely dumb luck but I think there’s something I heard in the Caribbean in Saint Vincent Island it's an expression that they have when you’re truly in synch with another person and your conversation they… they say you’re walking with me in my talk so we were walking together and what that means is that in a… in a sense that you’ve both submitted your separateness to the togetherness of the therapeutic relationship and in my own theatrical understanding I see this as the creation or the evocation of therapeutic mind and so that your therapist is not trying to be separate and instead is trying to be a participant in a greater relational connection which I call therapeutic mind and then it’s the voice of therapy that speaks. You happen to be the… the physical instrument and likewise the same for her. 

01:25:25
DIANE KJOS It's like you opened a treasure chest. 

01:25:30
BRADFORD KEENEY It was beautiful, it was a beautiful it was a moment and when she said queen... 

01:25:30
DIANE KJOS Queen of shock. 

01:25:35
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah that certainly shocked me. 

01:25:35
DIANE KJOS Yeah it did, it's like wow I didn’t know you had all this earlier, yeah. 

01:25:40
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes, yes. 

01:25:45
JON CARLSON In this next piece we are going to watch you don’t just stop with shock you develop shock you move shock into talking about shocking other people and then you bring it back to shocking herself lets watch this. 

01:25:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Okay. 

01:26:00
This morning he called me and told me at work that he did not think this marriage is going to work so this afternoon with a tear in my eye I beeped that I still love you. 

01:26:10
BRADFORD KEENEY So you do have this special talent and resource of a shocking that is proven to be something wonderful for the relationship. 

01:26:20
Yeah. 

01:26:20
BRADFORD KEENEY So how would you… would you I mean can you send a message to him that he would be able to figure out that you are inviting him for a walk? 

01:26:30
I probably can do that. 

01:26:35
BRADFORD KEENEY Do. 

01:26:35
Of course thinking down and sit down like 10 seconds I would do that. 

01:26:40
BRADFORD KEENEY So that would be very interesting and maybe you can use that as a clue for how to talk to him about things that aren’t so easy to talk about. Maybe you would come up with a special arrangement that… that sensitive issues are only to be addressed in code. You know I’m not sure exactly how you do it I mean it can take a lot of messaging on that… on that machine but… but you could arrange something, I’m sure you could do that with. 

01:27:10
Yeah, I probably could do. 

01:27:10
BRADFORD KEENEY After all your mother said you are… you are the master of this. Yes. 

01:27:10
That’s true. 

01:27:15
BRADFORD KEENEY So know we have hit… we have hit some interesting territory that is we have found the skill that you held back from telling me. That is you have this skill of shocking and you have used it with him and its been effective. 

01:27:30
JON CARLSON Brad as you watch this and we watch your work I’m wondering what’s going on inside of you right now. 

01:27:35
BRADFORD KEENEY Well I’m… I'm thinking in terms of the progression of this case the way you spoke about arriving with a construction crew and lets build this and… and it… it brings to mind that the initial redefinition of the husband’s drinking as actually carrying a positive contribution to her namely acknowledging her competency as a mother, led us with, led her to… to now be further inducted into a therapeutic contextualization of her life, but it leaves us with a dilemma how can they relate to one another as adults and leaves the paradox how as a good competent mother, can she teach him and employ herself also to have an adult to adult relationship because that’s paradoxical as if you are a mother you can't be spouse. Now the metaphor that has risen in this case as the way of talking about adult to adult, spouse to spouse relationship is shock. So now we are talking about how she can have a relationship with her husband rather than a child through the metaphor of shocking so that’s the way the language has organized itself without ever explicitly saying it. 

01:29:00
JON CARLSON Sure. 

01:29:00
BRADFORD KEENEY Because I don’t want a challenge her competency as a mother I would sound like a… a parent challenging her being incompetent in terms of her not being an adult, we never have to get into those issues but instead this natural metaphor has risen and it provides us a very tidy and clean way of redefining how they can relate to one another. 

01:29:25
DIANE KJOS She brings forth this other resource this communicating by code. 

01:29:30
BRADFORD KEENEY Isn’t that a wonderful. 

01:29:35
DIANE KJOS Yeah. You know it's like I was wondering how many other people do that, what a great idea. 

01:29:35
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes I would see families we forget unless we think about our own family life how strange and bizarre our family life is. I mean pets for example often have voices in families I don’t know if you had a, my own family origin we had a little dog the family used sort of used to ventriloquist like voice to talk for it so we created this mythology that our little dog name it was a dachshund named Schopenhauer after a German philosopher and it had its degree from Heidelberg and subatomic physics and a laboratory and I need the bed and the whole family shared in this exotic fantasy less than two years later that I began probing other families as a family therapist and found that yes your pets can have this bizarre place in the family life so I got excited and for a while was prescribing to families who had a pet and totally caught up in the pets presence by saying to them when nothing else seem to be moving forward I would say to them you know I think there's one thing we can all agree upon and that is… that's you all love this pet, this dog of yours you all love spot you know and boy you could see him you know come together at that moment and so why don’t you just take a little pause from all of this stuff you’re trying to work out with yourselves and give consideration for the dog. I would like for you this weekend to take the dog on a special unique vacation. You are all to sit and think what would this dog just absolutely adore and love, you know might you go to a restaurant order a piece of raw meat presented, go to park where sense are going to be strong and delightful and then take a… take a camera so you’ll have a scrap book of our dogs vacation and you know and I know that if a family does this it's something they’ll never ever forget they will rally together, there will be humor, there will be all the kinds of treasures that family life hopes and sometimes are forgotten when they get overly focused upon the problems and impasses so our families contain this delicious craziness which Carl Whitaker was always aware of. He was my inspiration, we’re talking about this, I… I loved his presence in therapy and he was always mindful of looking for what he called the families unique craziness and it's that creative part of family life that we as therapist I think must be attentive to because its… it's that treasure that chest we talked about that’s the treasure chest, every family has it and whether to view television habits or a pet or things that… that would shock you. 

01:32:25
JON CARLSON Right I think most families don’t have pets with pedigrees quite like yours philosophers. 

01:32:30
BRADFORD KEENEY I came from a very family. 

01:32:30
JON CARLSON we probably know. I… I… I noticed in this scene two that you didn’t have to solve this for her I mean you said I don’t know how you do this but you know I bet you know how to do this and she said yeah I do I think its therapist we often feel really hard pressed that we are supposed to do this for our clients in order to be like the physician who gives the cure tells him what to do. And you didn’t do that. 

01:33:00
BRADFORD KEENEY Precisely in fact when she identified herself earlier as mother calling me the queen of shock she then assumed in her posture that of a royalty I mean she looks like a queen that’s sitting there I mean I… the sparkle in her eyes you can see and… and the way in which she is assured about her own self and presences you know it's clearly I’m talking to someone who in this context and in this moment of therapy has great competence and who is someone who holds the possibilities for the evolution of her own mind so you are precisely right it’s a matter of attending, attending to what the client brings and sometimes doesn’t speak and sometimes doesn’t show but everything they say that’s about suffering or negative or impasse again always implies another side… another side. 

01:33:55
DIANE KJOS And the fact that came to me is it her mother probably gave to her that title not out of admiration. 

01:34:00
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes… It certainly yes. 

01:34:00
DIANE KJOS But out of frustration. 

01:34:05
BRADFORD KEENEY That's I said in childhood it was… it was a frustration. 

01:34:05
Always doing these things. 

01:34:10
BRADFORD KEENEY It was disorderly a childhood but now in adulthood the other side is and we know this because we look back at things we perhaps got in trouble as children and now as adults they have become fantastic badges of honor. 

01:34:20
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:34:20
JON CARLSON And it’s a credit to you that you recognized her royalty and by doing that you saved your head you know you’re able to… 

01:34:30
BRADFORD KEENEY I would have stay away from that therapeutic guillotine. Yeah. 

01:34:40
JON CARLSON This next clip that we are going to look at shows you talking about shocking and for shocking as a mother then shocking as a non-mother and then you make a big leap to having the couple shock someone or something together. 

01:34:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Well we’re weaving we’re now in the midst of taking all these various positive resources these building blocks and weaving them together. 

01:35:00
JON CARLSON Let’s watch how you do that. 

01:35:00
BRADFORD KEENEY Okay. So you are willing to announce that the shock is back. 

01:35:05
Yes I probably could do that, yes. 

01:35:10
BRADFORD KEENEY It wouldn’t make sense for you to put it up a sign in the house. 

01:35:10
No. 

01:35:15
BRADFORD KEENEY That’s too much it's not shocking enough. 

01:35:15
That's too much. 

01:35:15
BRADFORD KEENEY So you got to say it to yourself. 

01:35:15
I will say it to myself a few times right now with everyone else.... 

01:35:20
BRADFORD KEENEY The shock is back 

01:35:20
The shock is back. 

01:35:20
BRADFORD KEENEY The shock is back and then you have to start giving little codes may be that first code would be to get him take a walk, which… which you can, see the thing about shock I’m assuming that’s when you are not a mother. 

01:35:35
No. 

01:35:35
BRADFORD KEENEY So you're not a mother when your shocking. 

01:35:35
That's true. 

01:35:35
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah so you're a great mother and you’re a great shocker and this relationship needs more shock, that’s why I went to sleep. 

01:35:45
Sounds like it. 

01:35:45
BRADFORD KEENEY On your part. 

01:35:45
Yes. 

01:35:45
BRADFORD KEENEY You’re part, I mean he is still in the wake and you forgot and you left the shock. 

01:35:50
I’ve been so busy trying to hold everything together and make sure that everything runs the right way Monday to Friday by the time Saturday comes I’m like what ahh. 

01:36:00
BRADFORD KEENEY And you know how you know that you have brought the shock back, at the end of the day you will be able remember the times that you laughed. You’ve already told me that. Laughing… laughing has gone away. 

01:36:10
Yeah. 

01:36:10
BRADFORD KEENEY And… and put this together seems to me you’ll know at the end of each day by being able to remember that I laughed, I giggled you know and I was tickled in these ways that the shock is back. Okay. 

01:36:25
Thank you. 

01:36:30
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah I mean I think you… you simple laid out this fantastic gift this that's you have that sound your family knows about it, your mom knows it. 

01:36:40
Oh yeah my mom knows it. 

01:36:40
BRADFORD KEENEY Have you ever, you said that he also does a little trick with you in terms of the treasure and the gifts and the two of you together ever have you shocked somebody. 

01:36:50
[sil.] 

01:36:55
No I don’t think we really have. 

01:36:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Now that would be an experience. 

01:36:55
That would be. 

01:37:00
BRADFORD KEENEY Who with the… What person in the world would both of enjoy shocking? 

01:37:05
JON CARLSON Whether so much that happened in that little piece you know identifying laughing as a marker for her to… to see where things are working and now to bring this together to getting them to work on a common purpose a common task... 

01:37:20
BRADFORD KEENEY This is weaving the… the pieces are all there, now we’re putting them together and we make explicit that there’s two parts of her family life the one being a competent mother and the other being a competent shocker, we’re metaphorically saying yes you can be competent in your adult relationship as a spouse with your husband and the metaphor for that is shock and it needs more shock. We are also know including her as a occupant of the problem I mean it's not just the husband is the problem she now is accepting yes I need to bring more shock but we have done it in a benign way of resourceful way without pathologizing(ph) and the move toward utilizing shock together toward an… an… another… another person a third is… is now a way of talking about how to bring more shock into the relationship how to work on the relationship, how to build the relationship so this becomes a movement toward the… the real… the real (inaudible ). 

01:38:30
JON CARLSON As I watch this I’m… you know I'm amazed that how much she has changed and I’m wondering at what point in the interview did you get rid of her and bring in her happy twin. Because… because it seems like there was a substitution that you did on us that this new person emerged. 

01:38:50
BRADFORD KEENEY Well again its… it's to me a… a testimony to the power of context rather than thinking of changing people we and or even changing the therapist conduct it's better to think of changing the context because if the context is not resourceful the therapist will sound impotent and the client will sound hopeless but if the context is therapeutic the therapeutic voice awakens and the client directs the therapist in how to be useful, both are participating in being therapeutic to the roles that each are defying in the traditional way. 

01:39:30
JON CARLSON In our final piece we are going to watch you really get her to utilize her resources and utilize all of her assets. Lets watch this conclusion. 

01:39:40
BRADFORD KEENEY Okay. Planning you are going to… you are going to do the code thing with him. To say lets have a walk have the walk, and plot the shock to some one you both agree on and then feel better, you know orchestrate all that, let him just give a week, can you… can you promise me that? 

01:40:05
Yes I can promise you that. 

01:40:05
BRADFORD KEENEY That’s okay you nor just going to shock. 

01:40:10
No I will try I really I feel like I have to give it my all before I give it quits. 

01:40:15
BRADFORD KEENEY Yeah I mean you have got to try that which you know has been a resource for you throughout your whole life. You can stand in the face of the adversity and not use the tools you have. Whatever happens to you however the form of your relationship because he’s always going to be the father to your daughter no matter what the outcome, whether sickness comes whether climatic disaster comes, whether financial ruin or the other kind of disasters you know sweep stakes, you win the sweep stakes and all these people converge on you, you know success great success and great failure are both calamities. 

01:40:50
That’s true. 

01:40:55
BRADFORD KEENEY So whatever life brings to you, you have to grow upon the skills that… that were give to you, that’s your gift so really no matter what happens what matters is that you use what you have got. 

01:41:05
True. 

01:41:05
BRADFORD KEENEY And you are not using them. 

01:41:10
I’ve not been using that at all. 

01:41:10
BRADFORD KEENEY So just promise me you’ll use the gifts that you were born with. 

01:41:15
I could yes I will do that. 

01:41:15
BRADFORD KEENEY That’s it. 

01:41:15
Yes I will do that. 

01:41:15
BRADFORD KEENEY Then I’m going to… I'm going to feel very good that there’s a human being out there in the world who not only can analyze and make sense of things but who was a master at shocking, because this is an endangered species. 

01:41:30
Yes. 

01:41:30
BRADFORD KEENEY You know very few, few people with that skill left and it gives me hope for the future to know that there one person exercising it. Okay. 

01:41:45
Thank you. 

01:41:45
BRADFORD KEENEY Thank you good luck. 

01:41:45
Thank you. 

01:41:50
BRADFORD KEENEY Don't worry I was sort of wondering if you were going to buzz me. 

01:41:55
No, I couldn’t buzz you I don’t have anything, no tricks in my pocket yet. 

01:41:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Not yet that’s why not yet. 

01:42:00
Not yet, not yet. 

01:42:00
JON CARLSON Wow did you really think that she was going to shock you. 

01:42:05
BRADFORD KEENEY Well I actually it came to my mind as soon as I… as soon as I shook her hand I thought that buzzer which shows I mean immediately demonstrated for me that I had been fully inducted into a therapeutic context and I was in it and I think I want to add the comment that its very important for me to return to the truce that we delivered in the early days of psychotherapy by existential therapist reminding us that life is not some simple matter, if there is a problem we get out her you know laser and wiz that is operated, the life will always present calamites difficulties and challenges and so forth and I don’t want clients to walk away with this simplistic idea that oh let me go apply this and see if things get better because it limits their appreciation of the complexity of life rather, that’s why this was not a problem focused or a sol… a… a solution focused therapy its resource focused, its focused upon helping people acknowledge their humanness which includes that life will be filled with all kinds of calamity including successes and that… that’s not the point the point is are you living it with the gifts that were given to you to utilize. 

01:43:25
DIANE KJOS At that one point I said she just looks like she is hugging herself almost as if she is so thrilled. 

01:43:25
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes… yes… yes. 

01:43:30
DIANE KJOS Excitement. 

01:43:30
BRADFORD KEENEY And she… and she truly must be a master of shock. 

01:43:30
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:43:35
BRADFORD KEENEY With the delight she shows about the skill. 

01:43:35
JON CARLSON She is one in a million she was an endangered species. 

01:43:40
BRADFORD KEENEY Absolutely. 

01:43:40
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:43:40
JON CARLSON And now full of hope. 

01:43:45
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes and these… this endangered species more generally I think what you mentioned as the treasure chest in people's lives, in the family life and that’s being forgotten, it's being forgotten by clients who come to us basically again with amnesia forgetting we have these treasures might include shock and the problem is the same amnesia has spread to psychotherapist, they have forgotten. 

01:44:15
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:44:15
DIANE KJOS Actually yes. 

01:44:15
BRADFORD KEENEY Therapist too have forgotten that individuals, couples, families and whole ecologies have with them all the necessary operating equipment. 

01:44:25
DIANE KJOS Yeah so instead of starting out with I have this client who is overweight, married to an alcoholic you know. 

01:44:35
BRADFORD KEENEY Fix, fix, fix. 

01:44:35
DIANE KJOS Fix, fix, fix. 

01:44:35
BRADFORD KEENEY Or add, add, add. 

01:44:35
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:44:35
BRADFORD KEENEY Just say okay we are in your attic or in your basement, you know where is the treasure chest. 

01:44:40
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:44:40
BRADFORD KEENEY Lets open it, I remind you hey this is life its not perfect, but don’t go through it without using what you have got. 

01:44:45
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:44:45
JON CARLSON Hmmm… hmm. 

01:44:50
DIANE KJOS It was… it was great. 

01:44:50
JON CARLSON Well there are any final comments you might have for our viewers and all that they have seen you today? 

01:44:55
BRADFORD KEENEY Yes wake up don’t forget that you have that treasure chest. As a therapist as do client have it and if we return to the quest for finding the gifts that are present in the context that we interact with then its more likely that we will in enter into therapeutic mind the mind of therapy the voice of therapy that takes place naturally. 

01:45:30
JON CARLSON Well thank you very much for sharing your ideas.
