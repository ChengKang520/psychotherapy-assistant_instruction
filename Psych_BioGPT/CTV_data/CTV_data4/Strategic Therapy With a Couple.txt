Cloe Madanes, HDL, Lic 

00:00:55
CLOE MEDANES I am Cloe Madanes and thank you, thank you. Thank you. And I'm going to be with you here for an hour. Working with Joanne and Tom who have so graciously and generously volunteered to be the couple that I am interviewing today. So I want a big hand for Joanne and Tom. So let me tell you very quickly the little bit that I know about them. I met with them yesterday for about five minutes and I know that there are both professors of psychology on the West Coast and they teach college and the concern, the challenge that they're facing right now is an issue about celebrations and holidays. And correct me if I am wrong wrong. Ok. Tom gets in a bad mood when there's planning of a celebration. And the last event was for Thanksgiving when Joanne had invited people for Thanksgiving dinner and Tom was not very happy about that. And then Joanne you mentioned something about vacations also but we didn't get into that. So that's what we're going to talk about, we're going to create a bubble here where we're going to ignore you completely for a while and we'll see what we do. I'm not sure what we're going to do. Thank you. Ok. 

00:02:35
CLOE MEDANES Alright so tell me a little bit more about the two of you. How did you meet? 

00:02:40
JOANNE At work.

00:02:50
CLOE MEDANES What kind of work? What were you doing? 

00:02:50

CLOE MEDANES (crosstalk)Teaching. Oh. Ok. 

00:02:55

00:03:00
JOANNE No. 

00:03:00
CLOE MEDANES No. 

00:03:00
TOM No. 

00:03:00

00:03:10
CLOE MEDANES Alright. 

00:03:10
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:03:10
CLOE MEDANES So how did you know that you were in love with her? 

00:03:15
TOM Um. I used to go to her office and, uh, I just couldn't keep secrets. I used to, it was like a magical door frame? You know, I would go and talk to her and, uh, I just kept sharing things. And then I tried not to. I remember standing outside her office and crying kind of, you know, just cuz it was, she was so special And I shared things that I hadn't with anybody else. 

00:03:40
CLOE MEDANES Ah. So you knew right away as soon as you saw her? 

00:03:45
TOM Pretty early, yeah. I would say pretty early. She had been there about a month or two. Yeah 

00:03:50
CLOE MEDANES Aha 

00:03:50
TOM Yeah. 

00:03:55
CLOE MEDANES And you? How did you know you were in love with him? 

00:03:55
JOANNE Um. That's a good question. I hadn't thought of that. Yeah. Um. How did I know? I, um wanted to be around him, I wanted to listen I wanted to, we, we talked a lot. And um, I just loved talking with him and listening and just being around him. Yeah. 

00:04:25
CLOE MEDANES And when did you become aware that he worships you so much? 

00:04:30
JOANNE It took a long time, actually. I had no idea. So, um, probably more than a year. 

00:04:40
CLOE MEDANES Oh. 

00:04:40
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:04:40
CLOE MEDANES So you didn't notice right away that you were magical to him? He said that it was magical. 

00:04:45
JOANNE Uh, no I, and then when he told me I didn't understand. 

00:04:50
CLOE MEDANES Aha. So you take worship very well.(crosstalk) 

00:04:55
[sil.] 

00:05:00
JOANNE Um. Either that or he hides it very well. So. Yeah. 

00:05:05
CLOE MEDANES Well he was getting teary just remembering how he worshipped you in those early days and today also. 

00:05:10
TOM Mmm-hmm. 

00:05:10
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:05:15
TOM It feels more, more real now than it did.(crosstalk) 

00:05:15
JOANNE Yeah.(crosstalk) 

00:05:20
TOM There was a lot of fantasy I think in the beginning.(crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:05:20
JOANNE Yeah.(crosstalk) 

00:05:20
CLOE MEDANES Aha. 

00:05:20
JOANNE Now we have toothbrushes, and pets, and you know. 

00:05:25
TOM Yeah. 

00:05:30
CLOE MEDANES When you first got together, did somebody oppose your relationship? Did you find any difficulty with family? 

00:05:35
TOM Yeah. 

00:05:40
JOANNE Um. 

00:05:40
CLOE MEDANES Who? 

00:05:45
TOM We started it, uh, we were both married when we met. 

00:05:50
CLOE MEDANES You were both? 

00:05:50
TOM Married when we met. 

00:05:50
CLOE MEDANES Oh, I see. 

00:05:55
TOM Yeah, so a number of people opposed. 

00:05:55
CLOE MEDANES Oh. 

00:05:55
TOM Yeah. So. Yeah. 

00:06:00
JOANNE Alrighty then. 

00:06:05
CLOE MEDANES You both look so young for so much story behind. 

00:06:10
TOM Oh, thank you. 

00:06:15
JOANNE Yeah. It. Yeah. So, to be, to be very honest, we didn't, you know, we, we, we talked a lot. We became friends. We were colleagues. We got to know one another and we resisted one another quite a bit.(crosstalk) 

00:06:25
CLOE MEDANES (crosstalk)Yeah ok 

00:06:25
JOANNE So. It's not, um. Unfortunately we don't have that beautiful, easy start. 

00:06:35
CLOE MEDANES So you, you both went through a divorce while you were having a relationship. So those were tough times. 

00:06:40
TOM Yeah. 

00:06:40
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:06:40
CLOE MEDANES How long did that take? 

00:06:45
TOM About a year and a half, two years? 

00:06:45
JOANNE Yeah. Depends on what you mean by how long did it take, but yeah. It took a very long time. 

00:06:55
CLOE MEDANES Ok. Since, I, I meant since the time since the time that you decided that you were going to divorce and that you were going to be together. Probably took more than a year, right? 

00:07:05
TOM Yeah 

00:07:05
JOANNE It took some time. And then we actually, we separated for a little while because. 

00:07:10
TOM We couldn't make it work. 

00:07:10
JOANNE There was no... Just to make sure? And just because we had too much business I think to close, to make sure that it wasn't an exit. 

00:07:20
CLOE MEDANES Ok. And did you have children, from the previous marriages? You do. 

00:07:25
JOANNE I do. 

00:07:25
CLOE MEDANES How many? 

00:07:25
JOANNE One. 

00:07:30
CLOE MEDANES One? Girl or a boy? 

00:07:30
JOANNE A boy. 

00:07:30
CLOE MEDANES Ok. How old is he? 

00:07:30
JOANNE He's nine. 

00:07:35
CLOE MEDANES Wow. 

00:07:35
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:07:35
CLOE MEDANES And is he with you, or with the father? 

00:07:35
JOANNE He's with me and he's with his dad quite a bit and we're actually thank heavens, we have it worked out just beautifully. We're very flexible and We do things together. Yeah. 

00:07:50
CLOE MEDANES And how do you get along? With, 

00:07:55
TOM With, uh. 

00:07:55
CLOE MEDANES With the son? 

00:07:55
TOM With her son? Oh, pretty well. Yeah. 

00:07:55
JOANNE Yeah 

00:07:55
TOM Took a while to be clear about the the step-parent role. 

00:08:00
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:08:00
TOM Um. But it's gotten a lot better. I think particularly in the last year. 

00:08:05
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:08:05
TOM Yeah. 

00:08:05
JOANNE And he has the, the, he has very clear boundaries, too, my son. So he's very clear on, he adores his step-dad, and he has his dad, and, 

00:08:15
CLOE MEDANES And he’s fine with that. That’s great. 

00:08:15
JOANNE He’s very happy with it, I think. 

00:08:15
CLOE MEDANES What is his name? 

00:08:15
JOANE Gabe. 

00:08:20
CLOE MEDANES Gabe, great. Ok. Very good. Alright. So let me come back to the issue that you want to resolve. So what is the story about, let’s talk about the Thanksgiving dinner to have something more concrete. You decided to invite people by yourself? Or did you, was it a joint decision? 

00:08:40
JOANNE I definitely asked, I didn’t just invite. 

00:08:45
TOM Yeah. 

00:08:45
JOANNE What do you think about having, 

00:08:50
TOM Probably. I, I tend to not pay attention early on, so 

00:08:50
CLOE MEDANES Oh. 

00:08:55
TOM That’s part of the problem, I think. Yeah. 

00:08:55
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:08:55
TOM You probably did and I probably didn’t remember. My, my response usually is, is, I think it’s no big deal, I think I can deal with things and then as it gets closer, so, yeah. 

00:09:05
CLOE MEDANES So how many people did you invite? 

00:09:10
JOANNE Uh, two couples and one couple had a child. 

00:09:10
TOM So five. 

00:09:10
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:09:10
JOANNE So five. 

00:09:15
CLOE MEDANES Ok. And the idea was that you were going to cook together? Or you were going to cook by yourself? Or what, what were the arrangements? 

00:09:20
JOANNE I think I figured I would do it, the cooking on my own and maybe prepping you know, hanging lights, or something. 

00:09:30
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:09:30
TOM Cleaning. Yeah. 

00:09:30
CLOE MEDANES And then you began to get moody about it. 

00:09:35
TOM Yeah. 

00:09:35
JOANNE Oh, they can see us over there. Ok. Ignore that. Sorry. 

00:09:45
TOM So, um, we don’t teach on Wednesday before Thanksgiving so Tuesday night’s the beginning of the, the holiday and I think it, and I had been starting to dread it, I, I dread in general some holidays you know, from stuff from my childhood and uh, 

00:10:00
CLOE MEDANES What is this stuff from your childhood? 

00:10:00
TOM So the biggest piece, my parents were divorced so it’s my mom and uh, uh, you know there’s all this preparation. There’s a lot of fighting. My mom, my aunt, my grandmother, like fought over who would have the meal and that meant a lot so it was a power struggle followed by tons of, all this work, and nothing’s ever good enough, and more and more intensity leading up. And then you pretend like everything’s wonderful when people come. And all that intensity followed by all that lying was very distressing. Yeah. 

00:10:35
CLOE MEDANES Alright. So you get confused and you think that she’s your mother? 

00:10:40
TOM I know she’s not but I know, but the pattern starts to feel similar. You know. That piece. And this was the strongest, I think, in that the closer it got, the physiological, I just. It was more intense, I was like shaking, I had a hard time concentrating, you know by the time it’s like Wednesday night and Thursday morning, um. 

00:11:00
CLOE MEDANES So what, when. The emotion was fear? 

00:11:05
TOM Yeah, yeah. 

00:11:05
CLOE MEDANES What were you, 

00:11:10
TOM Real trembly, I mean.(crosstalk) 

00:11:10
CLOE MEDANES Like panicky? 

00:11:10
TOM Yeah. Very. Much more panicky than usual. Yeah. 

00:11:15
CLOE MEDANES Because you were expecting what? 

00:11:15
TOM I am, I didn’t, well. I was expecting to. We, we, we focus so much on, on, on the preparation and not like what you’re going to do together We focus so much on the meal and not on the people. And um, I hate that. I just, I, I hate that, I’ve hated that, you know, al- 

00:11:40
CLOE MEDANES So you’re afraid that the meal will fail? You’re afraid that she’s going to boss you around and you’re not going to be able to follow her orders? 

00:11:45
TOM I’m afraid, well, no, I I guess that it’s, it’s, that it’ll never end. The preparation it will be never good enough, 

00:11:55
CLOE MEDANES Aha. 

00:11:55
TOM Is the biggest piece, and that we’ll focus on things that are unimportant. And that what I think is important doesn’t 

00:12:00
CLOE MEDANES And what is important? 

00:12:00
TOM You know, that’s, that’s always been the problem, I guess, is that. Well, part of it is being with other people. And what are you gonna do and what are you gonna say? And enjoying them, not will they like the meal or not. So, so enjoying the company rather than worrying whether the meal and the house meets the expectations of other people. 

00:12:20
CLOE MEDANES Mmm-hmm. 

00:12:20
TOM So that’s 

00:12:20
CLOE MEDANES And is, how do you perceive this? Is this the way it is? Is his description accurate? 

00:12:30
JOANNE I think, so, yeah. 

00:12:30
CLOE MEDANES What, what do you think that he is afraid of? What is underlying this fear? 

00:12:35
JOANNE What do I think he’s afraid of? Um. I think I think he said it pretty accurately. I think he’s afraid that I will get into some kind of a whirlwind of making some kind of a stage. 

00:12:50
CLOE MEDANES Mmhmm. 

00:12:50
JOANNE And that he will be a, correct me, if I’m, 

00:12:55
TOM Yeah, it’s, 

00:12:55
JOANNE He will be a an actor, 

00:13:00
CLOE MEDANES Mmhmm. 

00:13:00
TOM With lines. 

00:13:00
JOANNE In my show? 

00:13:00
TOM Yeah. Well with inauthentic lines. 

00:13:05
JOANNE With inauthentic lines. 

00:13:05
TOM For us also growing up there, there was always all this tension you know, and it was never addressed and I always thought that, you know, that rituals and holidays could address things that were meaningful, not hide them. 

00:13:15
CLOE MEDANES Mmhmm. 

00:13:15
TOM And then we would in our family you would, you would stay until. People got grumpy. You know. You couldn’t leave when you were happy. You got to wait until somebody’s angry. Yeah. 

00:13:30
JOANNE It’s true. 

00:13:30
TOM And that’s, 

00:13:30
CLOE MEDANES Are, are you the oldest in your family? 

00:13:30
TOM I’m the middle. 

00:13:35
CLOE MEDANES You’re the middle. 

00:13:35
TOM But I’m the only boy. 

00:13:35
CLOE MEDANES Aha. 

00:13:35
TOM And there’s a lot of gender stereotyping. 

00:13:40
CLOE MEDANES Aha. 

00:13:40
TOM So you know so I cut the turkey. There’s this yeah very inauthentic role, you know. You cut the turkey but you have no say over anything and then you’re sort of cast aside and the women in the family, in my family of origin run things. Yeah. 

00:13:55
CLOE MEDANES Alright, but you also mentioned that there’s an issue with vacations? What is the issue with vacations? 

00:14:00
JOANNE Um we’ve struggled a little on vacations. It’s a little different. But um, gosh I don’t want, I don’t want it to be about Tom. I don’t want. You know. I think when we’ve gone away there’s, there’s the piece of, I. Correct me if I’m. Where maybe Tom doesn’t feel like, he knows where his role is with me and. 

00:14:25
TOM Mmm. 

00:14:25
JOANNE And with Gabe, my son. And wants to have fun and wants to be with us. But feels sometimes like there’s maybe not a place for him? 

00:14:35
TOM Well that, yeah. I think that in the stepfather role the hardest times are early in the morning and right and the bedtime ritual cuz that’s clearly where they become a unit. 

00:14:45
CLOE MEDANES Aha. 

00:14:45
TOM And it’s not so you just see that more? Yeah. 

00:14:50
JOANNE On vacation. 

00:14:50
TOM Yeah. 

00:14:50
JOANNE Yeah like we’ll be all in one room you know or something. 

00:14:55
CLOE MEDANES Oh. 

00:14:55
JOANNE So it’s really very, 

00:14:55
TOM Yeah. 

00:14:55
CLOE MEDANES So you always go on vacations the three of you together? 

00:15:00
JOANNE No. 

00:15:00
CLOE MEDANES No. So it’s, when it’s just the two of you is there an issue? 

00:15:05
TOM No that usually works pretty well. 

00:15:05
JOANNE Yeah that’s actually a lot better. 

00:15:05
TOM Yeah. 

00:15:05
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:15:05
TOM Yeah. 

00:15:10
CLOE MEDANES So what have you done to resolve the problem of the three of you together on vacation? 

00:15:15
TOM Have we done? 

00:15:15
JOANNE I think they have formed more of a unit. 

00:15:20
TOM Yeah. 

00:15:20
JOANNE And I really enjoy it. They go off and we’ve gone to this, we go to this retreats place that we just love, and they’ll go off and play ping pong and that, 

00:15:30
TOM Go sled 

00:15:30
JOANNE Foosball and go sledding and do stuff that frankly I’m not always thrilled to do with a nine year old boy but he is. 

00:15:40
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:15:40
JOANNE So. 

00:15:40
TOM And I accept the-I mean there’s when I accept the closeness that isn’t there? 

00:15:45
CLOE MEDANES Mmhmm. 

00:15:45
TOM Cuz I don’t have children um then I can accept the closeness that is there. And there are some of those opportunities cuz we eat meals together and so there’s still that. Um. I think when I was younger I was sort of I was the fun one or the, you know, or the interesting uncle so you’d get the play time but not the, the ground time, the morning, the evening when the, 

00:16:05
CLOE MEDANES Right. 

00:16:05
TOM Person’s sick, the mealtimes, those so that was sort of, 

00:16:10
CLOE MEDANES Right. 

00:16:10
TOM Foundational times. 

00:16:10
CLOE MEDANES So something that is really, um, difficult for you is to feel excluded or to feel that Joanne is not giving you her undivided attention? And that is the similarity with between the relationship with Gabe and the preparation of the Thanksgiving dinner. 

00:16:30
TOM Yeah. 

00:16:35
CLOE MEDANES The similarities are, is that she’s paying attention to somebody or something else than you. 

00:16:40
TOM Yeah and that, 

00:16:40
CLOE MEDANES And that’s painful because you really want her undivided attention. 

00:16:45
TOM Well and with Gabe, I also want, 

00:16:45
CLOE MEDANES His attention too, yes. 

00:16:50
TOM Right. 

00:16:50
CLOE MEDANES Yes. 

00:16:50
TOM I wanna be in the, um, the inner circle(crosstalk) 

00:16:50
JOANNE (crosstalk)Have a place. 

00:16:55
TOM Yeah, have a, have a place in the inner circle, yeah. 

00:16:55
CLOE MEDANES Right. 

00:16:55
TOM Yeah. 

00:17:00
CLOE MEDANES And have you developed a strategy for placing him in the inner circle with Gabe? 

00:17:05
JOANNE A strategy. No. Not an actual strategy, but what happens is they have things in common. 

00:17:10
CLOE MEDANES Ok. Like those games that they play. 

00:17:15
JOANNE And math and, 

00:17:15
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:17:15
JOANNE Computer things and I really, enjoy, 

00:17:20
CLOE MEDANES Alright. 

00:17:20
JOANNE Kind of taking time for myself, actually and I think the other thing that happened was this summer, Gabe was pretty sick and they had some really good time together. 

00:17:35
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:17:35
JOANNE You know. 

00:17:35
TOM Yeah. 

00:17:35
JOANNE It was, it was important. 

00:17:35
TOM Yeah. 

00:17:35
CLOE MEDANES Alright. So when, when you get in a bad mood anticipating the Thanksgiving dinner how does that bad mood manifest itself? Is it like a little boy that is tantrumy? Is it like a macho man that is angry? What is it? 

00:17:55
TOM Um, very resentful. I you know so I hold a lot in there and I think irritable and um snippy, do you know what I mean? 

00:18:05
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:18:05
TOM Yeah, yeah. 

00:18:10
CLOE MEDANES Is that how he is? 

00:18:10
JOANNE Yeah. Yeah. We’re polite, but um. 

00:18:15
TOM Yeah, yeah. 

00:18:15
CLOE MEDANES You can hold hands. So he gets more polite and cold. 

00:18:20
JOANNE He’s always,we’re always, we’re pretty polite. But the snippy, irritable and, 

00:18:25
TOM Mmhmm, and and then I, 

00:18:30
JOANNE Distant. 

00:18:30
TOM Yeah. 

00:18:30
JOANNE He goes and comes. 

00:18:30
CLOE MEDANES Aha. 

00:18:30
TOM Yeah. And you can feel it in the room. I mean it’s yeah. 

00:18:35
CLOE MEDANES Ok. And what advantage do you get from that? How does it work for you? It must have some advantage or you wouldn’t do it. 

00:18:40
TOM Yeah. It well it allows me to stay close cuz I’m afraid of missing something important but not feel like I have to take in like I have to swallow stuff that I don’t like. So I can, you know, it’s like a wall that I can stay close but still push out and not have to, yeah. 

00:19:05
CLOE MEDANES Ok. So the advantage would be that it gives you a certain distance so you don’t feel that her personality has taken you over. 

00:19:10
TOM Yeah. That’s yeah. 

00:19:15
CLOE MEDANES Ok. But you lose a lot also. Right? Because you don’t respond well to this. 

00:19:20
JOANNE No. Not at all. 

00:19:25
CLOE MEDANES What do you do? Do you get mad at him? Do you yell at him? Do you complain? What do you do? You get cold? 

00:19:30
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:19:35
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:19:35
JOANNE Just alrighty. This is what we’re doing now. 

00:19:35
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:19:35
JOANNE I, it’s anger but I don’t show it. It’s like, ok, I’m going to prepare everything, and if you wanna be that way, you know. Just very, not very evolved. 

00:19:55
CLOE MEDANES Ok. Alright. Have you found any way to break his pattern when he goes into that? Like for example if you start dancing naked around the house. 

00:20:05
JOANNE I think that would break his pattern. 

00:20:15
CLOE MEDANES So you could solve this, if you wanted to. 

00:20:20
JOANNE It, it would be out of character. 

00:20:25
CLOE MEDANES Exactly. To break somebody’s pattern you have to do something completely out of character. How would you respond if she starts dancing naked? 

00:20:40
TOM Yeah I can’t. I, no, I have no idea. 

00:20:45
JOANNE He responds pretty, it’s, it’s funny because it’s pretty easy to break it but I don’t want to, I get, I dig my heels in, and. 

00:20:55
CLOE MEDANES So you get obstinate. 

00:20:55
JOANNE I get very obstinate and very oh I don’t know, I kind of catastrophize in my mind. 

00:21:05
CLOE MEDANES Aha. 

00:21:05
JOANNE You know, it’s going to be this way forever, we’ll never have a good holiday, and community, and we’ll be dooah. 

00:21:10
CLOE MEDANES Aha. 

00:21:10
JOANNE And it’s all his fault. 

00:21:15
CLOE MEDANES Right. And do you know how to break that? I’m not going to suggest that you dance naked. 

00:21:20
TOM Oh. No you know I get caught up if I, if I apologize it’ll help but then I’ve lost you know and I you know I don’t want to apologize when I think that there’s something right. And I know this particular time I kept saying this is what I’m, you know this resentment that she, she had these people over, if I tell it it’ll just make it worse and we’ll have a big fight. And sometimes I mean, you, one of the things I’ve learned in this relationship is that you know, that fighting can lead to a decent outcome but I still don’t trust that. 

00:22:00
CLOE MEDANES Mmhmm. 

00:22:00
TOM So I was very much I remember a lot, you know, all day Wednesday, struggling with, do I share this? Don’t I? Do I share? Will it just make a bigger fight that’s worse cuz I knew I wasn’t you know calm enough in a place that I would probably fight poorly. But that’s. So between apology and fighting I guess where the two guesses. 

00:22:20
CLOE MEDANES Have you, have you tried for example, putting on a little apron and saying to her what would you like me to do now, ma’am? 

00:22:25
TOM Oh. I don’t know if I could do that without being you know doing it in, I would have done it in an angry and bitter way at that moment, you know, a very spiteful way. 

00:22:35
CLOE MEDANES You couldn’t do it in a funny way? 

00:22:40
TOM Well. 

00:22:40
CLOE MEDANES Well you have find some way of changing this. 

00:22:40
TOM Yeah. 

00:22:40
CLOE MEDANES And one way of changing it is to give in to the situation, take a secondary role, take her orders, and then you can get to talk about what are we going to talk about with these people? 

00:22:55
TOM Hmm. Hmmm. 

00:22:55
CLOE MEDANES Which is your concern. 

00:23:00
TOM Right, yeah. 

00:23:00
CLOE MEDANES I think that she takes it for granted that the conversation will flow and it will be fine. 

00:23:05
TOM Yeah. 

00:23:05
CLOE MEDANES But you don’t. You want to focus on that. 

00:23:05
TOM Cuz I find that is, that’s why we’re doing this. That’s the interesting and the joy of it. 

00:23:10
CLOE MEDANES Right. I think she knows that’s you’re doing this but she doesn’t feel you have to plan it, right? You have to plan the conversation, or do you? 

00:23:20
JOANNE No I don’t feel like we have to plan the conversation. Maybe just because there are kids we plan some games. 

00:23:25
TOM Uh it’s not about planning, it’s about to me, the preparation should make it more exciting, not more miserable. 

00:23:30
CLOE MEDANES Aha. So do you get miserable when you’re cooking? 

00:23:35
JOANNE No, I, I like it. 

00:23:40
CLOE MEDANES You like it? 

00:23:40
JOANNE I like it. 

00:23:40
CLOE MEDANES She gets miserable? 

00:23:40
TOM No. She likes it, I get miserable. 

00:23:40
CLOE MEDANES Ok, alright. Ok. So let’s take a bit of a look. Now you have a tool that you can use. 

00:23:50
JOANNE A what? 

00:23:50
CLOE MEDANES You have a tool that you can use now, I’m very serious about dancing naked. Well that way you can show him that you’re having fun, you’re not miserable about cooking or anything like that. You may have to interrupt the cooking if you do that. The turkey might burn. And you have a tool that you’re reluctant to use because you’re afraid that it’ll come out angry. 

00:24:20
TOM Yeah. 

00:24:20
CLOE MEDANES But you could just give in to the situation and say, Joanne, you’re in charge. 

00:24:25
TOM Mmhmm. 

00:24:25
CLOE MEDANES When we have guests, you’re in charge. As long as you dance naked a little bit, it’s ok. 

00:24:35
TOM Oh. 

00:24:35
CLOE MEDANES Alright. But let’s look at what is underlying this and so I was talking the other day, I don’t know if you came to my workshop about the fact that there are six universal human needs. And I don’t know if we have the connection with the computer so we can put this up. 

00:24:55
JOANNE We do. 

00:24:55
CLOE MEDANES We do? Ok, great. So you’re going to. The, the six human needs are the following: the need for certainty, that is the um, a critical word for certainty would be security, safety, predictability, knowing what’s going to happen next, and so on. Second need which is paradoxical, that as soon as you have certainty, you want uncertainty- variety, you want entertainment, you want fun, you want things to be unpredictable. The third need is for significance. The need to feel important, respected, unique. Then there’s the need for love and connection which is probably the most important in the sense that if um children don’t get love and connection they die. We all need to be connected to others, right? Then there’s the need for growth to learn to develop one’s skills to grow physically. And the need for contribution, to give to others. To give beyond oneself. So think about these six human needs. You can see them on the screen. You can turn around and see them there or on this screen, I don’t know which one you can see better. And let’s go to the flipcharts and I want each of you to write these needs in the order that they are most important to you. 

00:26:25
TOM Overall, or in the situation we’re talking about? 

00:26:25
CLOE MEDANES No no, for you in your own life, what are the needs that are most important? That, and we’re going to focus on the first two for each of you. But just to get an idea I would like you to write all of them. Let’s not trip on all this stuff. You’re, you’re hooked but you have plenty of room to walk. 

00:26:45
JOANNE Ok, thank you. 

00:26:45
CLOE MEDANES And you can just put that over there. Yeah. 

00:26:50
TOM Ok. 

00:26:50
CLOE MEDANES So. You have the needs up there? Um I can write them all up for you again if we can’t get up on the screen. They’ll be up on the screen in one second. There you go. So of these six human needs, which, how would you order them in order of importance, the first one being the most important, the one need that you feel intensely that you have to satisfy at all times. 

00:27:30
[sil.] 

00:27:30
JOANNE Do you want all of them in order or just the top two? 

00:27:35
CLOE MEDANES Yes, yes, I would like to see all of them. 

00:27:40
[sil.] 

00:28:10
CLOE MEDANES I will repeat them. I will read them to you and we’re going to have them on the screen in a second. I don’t want to say anything until they’re finished writing. 

00:28:20
[sil.] 

00:28:40
CLOE MEDANES Ok. So let’s look at what they have here. Joanne has as her most important need is the need to grow. Then she has love and connection. Then she has contribution as her third, variety as the fourth, significance and certainty. And Tom has significance first, love and connection second, contribution, growth, uncertainty/variety, and then certainty. You need me to repeat them again, I will. No? You got it? Ok. So let’s look at this. Both of them have love and connection as the second need. There we already see a bit of a problem, guys. Because their relationship, you have a wonderful relationship and I totally appreciate that. But that relationship could be even better if both of you could think that love and connection is the most important thing for you. Because that is the essence of a marriage. And marriage is all about love and connection. And so if you can make that switch and think, before I think, feel significant, before I feel important, I want to give my love to Joanne. I want to give her my love even if I, I don’t feel important. 

00:30:00
TOM Mmmmm. 

00:30:00
CLOE MEDANES Even if she doesn’t respect me. 

00:30:00
TOM Mmmmm. 

00:30:00
CLOE MEDANES I will still love her. If you can feel even if I am not growing, learning, developing, my love for Tom is the most important thing. That would be crucial exercise. And you have accomplished a lot in your lives so I’m sure that you can accomplish this. So let’s look at what happens here. Where, what the discrepancies are. You have put significance at the top of your list. So it’s crucial important for you to feel respected, appreciated, and so on. There’s a discrepancy here because you have that almost at the bottom of the list. And so probably because you don’t value significance that much, you sometimes don’t give him all the significance that he needs. Because for him it’s so important. You don’t think it’s so important. You have it almost at the bottom of the list. Alright. And for you, growth is number four. For her, it’s number one. 

00:31:00
TOM Mmmhmmm. 

00:31:00
CLOE MEDANES So it’s possible that you don’t pay enough attention to help her grow as she might want to because growth is not that important for you Right? In the other things, you are very similar. You are similar in your need to contribution, you’re similar in your need for variety, and so on. So now let’s take the two most important ones that for Tom are significance and love/connection. You’re going to do this better than me. 

00:31:30
JOANNE Do you want me to turn this off? 

00:31:30
CLOE MEDANES Can we remove the sheets? Yeah. Oh yeah, I’ll just pull it back, it’s ok. 

00:31:35
TOM Oh. 

00:31:35
CLOE MEDANES No, that’s fine. 

00:31:35
TOM Flip it over? 

00:31:35
CLOE MEDANES Yeah, yeah, you’re going to take those home, anyway. 

00:31:40
TOM Ok. 

00:31:40
CLOE MEDANES So let’s start Tom’s significance. 

00:31:40
TOM Ok. 

00:31:40
CLOE MEDANES Write down significance. What are your vehicles for obtaining significance? Give me two or three ways that, what has to happen for you to feel that you are significant? 

00:32:00
TOM Hmmm. 

00:32:05
[sil.] 

00:32:10
CLOE MEDANES See your impact on others. 

00:32:10
TOM Mmm-hmm. 

00:32:10
CLOE MEDANES You want to see that you’re creating an impact on others. 

00:32:15
TOM Yeah. Like with students. 

00:32:15
CLOE MEDANES Like with students. A positive impact, or a negative impact? Alright, positive impact. Ok. 

00:32:20
TOM Um. 

00:32:20
CLOE MEDANES Well sometimes you create an impact on Joanne that is not positive. Ok. What else has to happen? 

00:32:30
TOM Um. I don’t know how to say this. 

00:32:35
CLOE MEDANES That it relates to? 

00:32:40
TOM Like big ideas, or universal. 

00:32:45
CLOE MEDANES Big ideas. 

00:32:45
TOM Universal truths. 

00:32:45
CLOE MEDANES So you want to be heard in your ideas. 

00:32:50
TOM Well I want it to be connected to things that are important in general in life, you know, the, the big things. 

00:32:55
CLOE MEDANES Ok. Anything else? 

00:33:00
TOM Um. Yeah, you know, sadly. Yeah, you know, um, there’s a lot of pride in being, um, recognized. 

00:33:10
CLOE MEDANES Pride. 

00:33:15
TOM I don’t, I’m not. 

00:33:15
CLOE MEDANES Ok. So you want to feel proud, it’s important for you to feel proud. 

00:33:15
TOM No, I, I do feel a lot of pride, unfortunately. And I’d like to be recognized. You know even for the little things I do around the house and that kind of stuff. 

00:33:25
CLOE MEDANES Ok. To be recognized for things that you do. 

00:33:25
TOM Yeah, just. 

00:33:25
CLOE MEDANES Alright. So let’s for a moment do Joanne and then I’ll come back to you. So you have growth. 

00:33:30
JOANNE Right. 

00:33:35
CLOE MEDANES So what has to happen, Joanne, for you to feel that you’re growing? 

00:33:40
JOANNE Um. There are preconditions, and then there are things that are growthful, so. 

00:33:50
CLOE MEDANES Both. Whatever comes to mind. 

00:33:50
JOANNE Both? Ok um. I need, uh, this isn’t, uh, sorry. Um. To be able to center. 

00:34:10
CLOE MEDANES To be able to? 

00:34:10
JOANNE Center. 

00:34:10
CLOE MEDANES Center. Ok, what does center mean? To be centered? 

00:34:15
JOANNE To be centered in myself. 

00:34:15
CLOE MEDANES Ok. When you’re centered, you feel like you’re growing. Ok. 

00:34:20
JOANNE And like, like I can. It’s one of those preconditions. 

00:34:25
CLOE MEDANES Ok. Alright. 

00:34:25
JOANNE Um. Uh, for me, art is a. 

00:34:30
CLOE MEDANES Art? 

00:34:30
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:34:30
CLOE MEDANES You do art? 

00:34:30
JOANNE I do. 

00:34:30
CLOE MEDANES What do you do? 

00:34:30
JOANNE I draw. 

00:34:35
CLOE MEDANES Ok. Doing art. Right. 

00:34:35
JOANNE Or create other stuff. Um. And the, there are a lot of things that the, um. The painful work on the relationship is, is growthful. 

00:34:50
CLOE MEDANES Painful? 

00:34:50
JOANNE Sometimes, yeah. 

00:34:55
CLOE MEDANES Work? 

00:34:55
JOANNE On-- 

00:34:55
CLOE MEDANES On-- 

00:34:55
JOANNE The relationship. 

00:34:55
CLOE MEDANES On the relationship. Why is it painful? 

00:35:00
JOANNE The other stuff’s easy, it’s not growthful. It’s the painful stuff that sometimes-- 

00:35:05
CLOE MEDANES So you mean, for example, discussing the relationship with Tom, is that what you mean? 

00:35:10
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:35:15
CLOE MEDANES Going through, it’s like growth pains. 

00:35:15
JOANNE Exactly. 

00:35:15
CLOE MEDANES Of improving, like growth pains. 

00:35:15
JOANNE Changing. 

00:35:20
CLOE MEDANES Changes. Ok. Alright. So now let’s do something with this. I start with you, Joanne, this time. 

00:35:25
JOANNE Ok. 

00:35:25
CLOE MEDANES When your first vehicle to feel that you’re growing is to be centered. On a scale from one to ten, ten being the highest grade, what grade would you give Tom, in his ability to help you to feel centered? Or in his willingness, or in his skill in helping you to feel centered, or his practice of helping you to feel centered. 

00:35:50
JOANNE I would say for willingness I, I’d go nine or ten. 

00:35:55
CLOE MEDANES Nine to ten? 

00:35:55
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:36:00
CLOE MEDANES Very good so let’s say, give him a ten, let’s be generous. 

00:36:00
JOANNE Ok. 

00:36:05
CLOE MEDANES What grade would you give yourself in your ability to help Joanne to feel centered? 

00:36:10
TOM Well in willingness I would go nine or ten. Ability I would probably go seven. 

00:36:15
CLOE MEDANES Seven. 

00:36:15
TOM Six or seven. Yeah. 

00:36:15
CLOE MEDANES Ok. So you give yourself an eight, let’s say. Put an eight next to it. 

00:36:20
TOM Ok. 

00:36:20
CLOE MEDANES And, uh, and in terms of helping you with your art, what grade would you give Tom? 

00:36:35
JOANNE Um, a ten. 

00:36:40
CLOE MEDANES A ten. Alright. What grade would you give yourself, Tom? 

00:36:40
TOM For the art, yeah, I think nine or ten. Yeah. 

00:36:45
CLOE MEDANES Ok. Ten. Alright, nine or ten, ok. And in helping you go through the painful work on improving the relationship, what grade would you give him? 

00:36:55
JOANNE I’d give him a ten. 

00:36:55
TOM Oh. 

00:36:55
CLOE MEDANES Ten? Very good. And you? What grade? 

00:36:55
TOM Yeah, a nine, not to feel stupid. 

00:37:00
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:37:00
TOM Yeah. I’m learning. 

00:37:05
CLOE MEDANES Alright. So. Now let’s look at Tom. Tom has significance as his most important need. And one of his vehicles is to see that he makes an impact on others. What grade would you give Joanne in terms of helping you to have an impact on others? 

00:37:25
TOM How does, and in terms of seeing that, I think she’s very good at helping me see that. Yeah. I give nine. 

00:37:30
CLOE MEDANES Ok. Is that correct? What grade would you give yourself? 

00:37:35
JOANNE Lower. Um, you mean to see your impact on me? 

00:37:40
CLOE MEDANES No, no, no. Your helping him to make an impact on others. 

00:37:40
JOANNE Oh to see his impact on others? Oh, ok. Yeah. Maybe eight or nine. 

00:37:50
CLOE MEDANES Ok. And,uh, in relating to big ideas and universal truths, and helping you with that, what grade would you give Joanne? 

00:38:00
TOM Hmm. 

00:38:00
CLOE MEDANES You have to be sincere in this. 

00:38:05
TOM Yeah, I don’t. I hadn’t thought about that. 

00:38:05
CLOE MEDANES Think about it for a minute. 

00:38:10
TOM Yeah. Yeah, I’d, I’d go with a ten for that, I think, actually. She really does. 

00:38:15
CLOE MEDANES What grade would you give yourself? Being totally honest. 

00:38:25
JOANNE Eight. 

00:38:25
CLOE MEDANES Eight? Ok. And in helping you with your feeling that you’re recognized, that you can be proud of yourself, what grade would you give Joanne? 

00:38:35
TOM Um, probably an eight. 

00:38:40
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:38:40
TOM Five. 

00:38:40
CLOE MEDANES Five? 

00:38:40
TOM Yeah. 

00:38:40
CLOE MEDANES That’s honest, ok. 

00:38:45
JOANNE As I look at these, it’s funny, because I think we help one another, but I, I can’t do these for myself and Tom doesn’t do these very well for himself. 

00:38:55
CLOE MEDANES Mmmhmm. 

00:38:55
TOM Mmmhmm. 

00:38:55
JOANNE I mean, I don’t know if, anyway, I just noticed that. 

00:39:00
CLOE MEDANES Oh, that’s interesting. So let’s do that. Let’s turn it around and do it that way. What grade do you give yourself in fulfilling your need for significance by making an impact on others? 

00:39:15
TOM Hmmm. I don’t know, like a seven or an eight. Yeah. 

00:39:20
CLOE MEDANES So less than you give her. 

00:39:20
TOM Yeah. 

00:39:20
CLOE MEDANES Ok. But put a seven or an eight and circle it so we know that that’s your own grade. 

00:39:25
TOM Ok. 

00:39:30
CLOE MEDANES Ok. And in relating to big ideas and universal truths, what grade do you give yourself? 

00:39:35
TOM (ph)Remember card on that? 

00:39:35
JOANNE I do. 

00:39:35
TOM Yeah, probably a nine. 

00:39:40
CLOE MEDANES Ok. And in feeling proud and recognized? 

00:39:40
TOM Oh that’s a mess. Yeah, like a five. 

00:39:45
CLOE MEDANES Five. Ok. And what grade do you give yourself? (crosstalk)For being centered? 

00:39:50
JOANNE (crosstalk) Being able to centered? About a two. Um. 

00:40:00
CLOE MEDANES And your art? Two? 

00:40:00
TOM Ah. 

00:40:00
JOANNE This is about taking the time to actually, 

00:40:05
CLOE MEDANES Yes, yes. 

00:40:05
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:40:05
CLOE MEDANES And to work on the relationship? 

00:40:10
TOM You do. No. 

00:40:10
CLOE MEDANES A five? 

00:40:10
TOM Wow. 

00:40:15
CLOE MEDANES So it’s very interesting because you give yourself a two in being centered, Joanne, a two for art, and a five for working on the relationship. And you give yourself better grades except when it comes to your pride. 

00:40:30
TOM Mmmhmm. 

00:40:30
CLOE MEDANES And feeling recognized which is a five. But you know, guys? This is wonderful because you have such a complimentary relationship. So the grades that you give each other are much higher than what you do for yourself. So what you need to do is take more responsibility for your own and not to expect so much to come from the other person. 

00:40:55
TOM Mmmm. 

00:40:55
CLOE MEDANES And I think that the presenting problem that you have of his being unhappy in the preparation of celebrations and so on is because he expects so much to come from you and at that moment, you are focused on something else, and you’re not giving him the recognition and the attention that he so craves and-- 

00:41:15
JOANNE Right. 

00:41:15
CLOE MEDANES So needs. So you need some cue words, something that you have, that you’ll dance naked but you need something. 

00:41:20
JOANNE What? 

00:41:25
CLOE MEDANES You’ll dance naked. 

00:41:25
JOANNE Oh. 

00:41:25
CLOE MEDANES So that’s my, but you need something that you’re gong to say to yourself that, for example, that could be, she’s cooking the turkey just for me. 

00:41:35
TOM Mmmm. 

00:41:35
CLOE MEDANES Or I’m going to eat the biggest piece of that turkey or something that will turn around whatever she’s doing into something that is related to you. 

00:41:45
TOM Mmmhmm. 

00:41:45
CLOE MEDANES Or you could simply walk into the kitchen and say, where’s that naked dancing? Alright, let’s do, turn the page. 

00:41:55
TOM Ok. 

00:41:55
CLOE MEDANES And let’s do love and significance. 

00:42:00
TOM Sounds good. 

00:42:00
CLOE MEDANES For both of you love and significance was second. So, Joanne tell me what has to happen, I mean not love and significance, love and connection, sorry. Love and connection. What has to happen, Joanne, for you to feel that you are getting enough love and connection? Or giving enough love? Love is about getting and giving. 

00:42:20
JOANNE Right. I, I think I actually have to feel like I’m giving it in order to feel like I’m experiencing. 

00:42:30
CLOE MEDANES Ok so for you it’s more important to give it. 

00:42:30
JOANNE It’s not that it, it’s, that’s when I feel it . 

00:42:35
CLOE MEDANES That’s what you feel. Ok. 

00:42:35
JOANNE I don’t know what I would do if I wasn’t receiving it. 

00:42:40
CLOE MEDANES Ok so one way is to give it. To give love. What else has to happen for you to feel that you’re experiencing enough love and connection? 

00:43:00
[sil.] 

00:43:00
CLOE MEDANES Just giving it? 

00:43:00
JOANNE No, I’m, I’m, I’m drawing a blank, but I don’t think it’s cuz there’s nothing there. 

00:43:05
CLOE MEDANES Ok. So think about it and I’ll turn to Tom. What has to happen for you to feel that enough experience of love and connection? 

00:43:15
TOM I think the, that the first is honesty. 

00:43:20
JOANNE Mmhmm. 

00:43:20
CLOE MEDANES Honesty? 

00:43:20
TOM Yeah. 

00:43:20
CLOE MEDANES What do you, what do you mean by honesty? 

00:43:25
TOM Well if there’s something else going on, like you know, admitting I’m resentful, was, was, was a big one, often. Or acknowledging that something bigger’s going on. It really feeds on that piece of pretending that everything’s ok when it’s not. So it’s the opposite, it’s sort of the antidote to that? 

00:43:40
CLOE MEDANES So is it, is it honesty with yourself, or honesty with Joanne? 

00:43:45
TOM Honesty with Joanne in the situa- about what’s going on right now. 

00:43:45
CLOE MEDANES Ok. Alright. What else has to happen for you to feel love and connection? 

00:44:00
[sil.] 

00:44:00
CLOE MEDANES I, do you feel honest right now? 

00:44:05
TOM Mostly. 

00:44:05
CLOE MEDANES Say the truth, now. 

00:44:10
TOM Um. 

00:44:10
CLOE MEDANES Oh you got yourself into this by putting honesty. 

00:44:15
TOM Yeah, I, uh. 

00:44:15
CLOE MEDANES What is the part that you feel is not honest? 

00:44:20
TOM Um, I don’t know. So, so you said, yesterday, when we met, that you’re sure that you could make sure this was fixed? 

00:44:30
CLOE MEDANES Yes. 

00:44:30
TOM I, I don’t, I don’t see problems working that way so I’m like, oh, good, you know, that’s exciting, but I was like, well, um. 

00:44:40
CLOE MEDANES I’m not going to, I’m not going to let you get rid of me until this is complete. It doesn’t end here. 

00:44:45
TOM That’s very bad. 

00:44:45
CLOE MEDANES Alright. 

00:44:45
TOM Yeah. 

00:44:45
CLOE MEDANES Trust me, trust me. So it’s-- 

00:44:50
TOM So I have yeah I have, I still have little doubts. Or you know there’s a part of me that judges and say well how much has gotten rid of so far and how we are going to get-- 

00:45:00
CLOE MEDANES Ok so there’s a scientific psychologist part of you. 

00:45:00
TOM (ph)vective, yes. 

00:45:00
CLOE MEDANES That is thinking about the statistical chances of such a thing happening. 

00:45:05
TOM Exactly. Updating the scores and the questionnaires. 

00:45:10
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:45:10
JOANNE You know him already. 

00:45:10
CLOE MEDANES So what part of, what part of the problem would you like to keep? To make sure that I don’t solve that because, I don’t want to solve everything. 

00:45:20
TOM Yeah, that’s a great question. 

00:45:25
CLOE MEDANES It’s an honest question. 

00:45:25
TOM Yeah. 

00:45:25
CLOE MEDANES So you want to be grumpy sometimes? 

00:45:30
TOM I want to, yeah, I want to be able to, to assert my way or my-- 

00:45:35
CLOE MEDANES (crosstalk)Your way of being grumpy when you want to-- 

00:45:35
TOM (crosstalk)What I think is important. 

00:45:35
CLOE MEDANES Right. Ok. So we’ll be make sure to keep it. So how often should that be? Once a month, once a week, every day for a few minutes, how often do you want to be grumpy? 

00:45:50
TOM Yeah, I’d like every day for a few minutes. 

00:45:50
CLOE MEDANES Every day for a few minutes? I’ll make sure. 

00:45:55
TOM Ok. 

00:45:55
CLOE MEDANES I promise you we’ll make sure. Joanne, do you agree with every day for a few minutes he can be grumpy? 

00:46:00
JOANNE Oh yeah, he’s actually not very grumpy, it’s funny. But um. 

00:46:05
TOM Yeah. 

00:46:05
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:46:05
TOM But I wanna have the right to have it, you know. 

00:46:10
JOANNE Ok. 

00:46:10
CLOE MEDANES Alright, alright. Maybe we should, we should get him a costume of a little dwarf that’s called Grumpy? When you put on that, then you can be grumpy. And you can call him grumpy. Alright. We’ll make sure to give him that. I think it’s important part of the relationship. 

00:46:30
JOANNE Mmhmm. Yeah. 

00:46:35
CLOE MEDANES You know, some people feel great satisfaction from being grumpy once in a while, it’s a way of connecting with oneself. 

00:46:40
TOM Yeah. 

00:46:40
JOANNE And I can be. 

00:46:40
CLOE MEDANES And you connect with yourself that way. 

00:46:40
TOM Yeah. 

00:46:40
CLOE MEDANES Yeah. 

00:46:45
JOANNE I can be very intolerant of that. 

00:46:45
CLOE MEDANES Oh. 

00:46:45
JOANNE You know, so. 

00:46:45
CLOE MEDANES Oh. 

00:46:45
JOANNE I, I can. 

00:46:50
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:46:50
JOANNE You know if the grumpy was five minutes, I’ll carry it on for the next two hours. 

00:46:55
CLOE MEDANES Instead, right, instead of being intolerant you could pat him on the head and say, ok, little grumpy. 

00:47:00
JOANNE Not when he’s grumpy. 

00:47:05
CLOE MEDANES He would, he, what would happen? He would snap at you? 

00:47:05
JOANNE He probably wouldn’t appreciate it very much. 

00:47:10
CLOE MEDANES Ok but see you have to turn it into a mutual agreement, fun thing, instead of a dangerous thing. 

00:47:20
TOM Mmmm. 

00:47:20
JOANNE Right. 

00:47:20
CLOE MEDANES There should be nothing in him that feels dangerous to you. Not even his grumpiness. That’s really important. Do you agree with that? 

00:47:30
TOM Hmmm. 

00:47:30
CLOE MEDANES Or do you want her to feel that you’re dangerous? Is that part of the game between you? 

00:47:35
TOM No. 

00:47:35
JOANNE No. 

00:47:35
TOM No. It’s more protecting myself, sort of pushing boundaries up. 

00:47:40
CLOE MEDANES Ok, ok. And so, I think you’re a strong woman and you can let him push against you, and you’ll be fine without feeling that you’re in danger. 

00:47:50
JOANNE It, danger isn’t a word that I would use. Annoyed. 

00:47:50
CLOE MEDANES Annoyed. Ok. 

00:47:55
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:47:55
CLOE MEDANES Right. 

00:47:55
JOANNE I want to throw things at him when he’s-- 

00:47:55
CLOE MEDANES Oh, but you have a better thing to do. What is the better thing that you can do? 

00:48:00
JOANNE The better thing to do? Um. What? 

00:48:05
CLOE MEDANES Dancing naked. 

00:48:10
JOANNE Oh. I forgot, of course. What I should probably do is go off by myself and center somewhere which is what I want. 

00:48:20
CLOE MEDANES No, no, no. 

00:48:20
JOANNE No? Dance naked. Ok. 

00:48:20
CLOE MEDANES Dancing naked, no. It’s the opposite. You don’t want to go off by yourself. 

00:48:30
JOANNE No? Ok. 

00:48:30
CLOE MEDANES You want to make this a fun, loving relationship which it already is except for this little thing that you have between you. Ok, well, what else has to happen for you to feel love and connection? 

00:48:40
TOM Um. I think feel accepted even when I make mistakes. 

00:48:50
CLOE MEDANES Accepted even when you make mistakes. Ok. 

00:48:55
TOM You know not feeling out of the relationship. 

00:49:00
CLOE MEDANES Ok, ok. So that’s a part of her that has to be more tolerant. Ok. And did you think, Joanne, what, what has to happen for to feel love and connection? 

00:49:10
JOANNE I’m trying. Um. 

00:49:20
[sil.] 

00:49:20
CLOE MEDANES Is there something that Tom can do for you to feel love and connection? That he can do or say or show you? 

00:49:30
JOANNE I know when he listens and when we talk about real things, I feel very connected. 

00:49:35
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:49:35
JOANNE Um. 

00:49:40
CLOE MEDANES So talking, when Tom talks to me about real things? 

00:49:45
JOANNE And vice versa. 

00:49:45
CLOE MEDANES Ok. So talking with Tom about real things. What are real things? 

00:49:50
JOANNE Um. 

00:49:55
CLOE MEDANES What do you mean about real things? What are real things? 

00:50:00
JOANNE Um, either parts of my spirituality, or-- 

00:50:05
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:50:05
JOANNE Things that we’re struggling with, um. 

00:50:10
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:50:10
JOANNE Parts of my, my unevolved parts that are, that make no sense. 

00:50:15
TOM Mmmm. 

00:50:15
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:50:15
JOANNE And um. 

00:50:15
CLOE MEDANES Very good. Alright. So let’s go to the first one. Giving love. What grade would you give yourself for giving love? 

00:50:25
JOANNE Um. Five. 

00:50:30
CLOE MEDANES Five. And what grade would you give Tom for helping you to give love? 

00:50:45
[sil.] 

00:50:45
JOANNE Wow. Um. It’s complicated. Cuz. 

00:50:55
CLOE MEDANES Just be spontaneous. 

00:50:55
JOANNE Ok. Ten. 

00:50:55
CLOE MEDANES Ten? Ok. So again it’s more what he helps you than what you feel that you’re able to do by yourself. And for talking about real things? What grade do you give yourself? 

00:51:10
JOANNE Eight? 

00:51:10
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:51:10
JOANNE (ph)Something. 

00:51:10
CLOE MEDANES Ok so that’s better. And what grade do you give Tom? 

00:51:15
JOANNE Ten. 

00:51:15
CLOE MEDANES Ten. Very good. Is she correct in the grades that she’s giving you? 

00:51:20
TOM I think, uh, it’s a little high, but I appreciate it. 

00:51:25
CLOE MEDANES Ok. 

00:51:25
TOM Ok. 

00:51:25
CLOE MEDANES Alright. Alright so now let’s, let’s look at you. What grade do you give yourself for honesty with Joanne about what’s happening right now? 

00:51:40
TOM Yeah. Most of the time, pretty good, but I just know that whole Thanksgiving weekend, I was very poor. So anyway. So I’ll say eight. 

00:51:45
CLOE MEDANES Eight. And what grade do you give her for honesty? 

00:51:50
TOM The same thing, it’s you know, usually we’re pretty good, and then we have these bad spells, so. 

00:51:55
CLOE MEDANES Alright. 

00:51:55
TOM I think we’re pretty much the same on that. 

00:52:00
CLOE MEDANES And for accepting yourself when you make a mistake,(crosstalk) what grade do you give yourself? 

00:52:00
TOM (crosstalk)Oh, a two. 

00:52:05
CLOE MEDANES A two? 

00:52:05
TOM Oh, yeah. 

00:52:05
CLOE MEDANES So you’re hard on yourself. So you’re not only hard on me because I said that I was going to solve, you’re hard on yourself, too. Ok, alright. 

00:52:15
TOM Yes, very. Yeah. 

00:52:15
CLOE MEDANES And what grade do you give Joanne for accepting you when you make mistakes? 

00:52:20
TOM I say nine. 

00:52:20
CLOE MEDANES A nine. Alright. So again, you help each other a lot. 

00:52:25
TOM Yeah. 

00:52:25
CLOE MEDANES Alright. So um, what do you suggest to Joanne, Tom, that she can do to improve her grade, her own grade of the five in giving love. Could you acknowledge more frequently that she loves you and that you like her love? Would that help her to give love more? 

00:52:50
TOM Oh that, it’s what I can do to help her, or what she can do? 

00:52:55
CLOE MEDANES Yes, what you can do to help her. 

00:52:55
TOM Oh what can I do to help her. Yeah, I think she, she doesn’t know how kind and considerate she is on an ongoing basis, so, yeah, I could make that more obvious. 

00:53:05
CLOE MEDANES So go over and give her a hug and tell her. 

00:53:05
TOM Oh. 

00:53:10
JOANNE Oh. Way too many people here. 

00:53:15
TOM You’re very calm. 

00:53:15
JOANNE And they heard that. 

00:53:15
TOM And very loving. 

00:53:15
CLOE MEDANES Alright. 

00:53:15
JOANNE Thank you. 

00:53:20
CLOE MEDANES Well we still have more to do so how about it. How can you help him to accept himself better when he makes a mistake? 

00:53:25
JOANNE Oh, man. Um. 

00:53:30
CLOE MEDANES Let’s think of something else than dancing naked. You could dance naked. 

00:53:40
JOANNE That’s just gonna be the default. 

00:53:40
CLOE MEDANES Let’s think about something else, you could tell him don’t be so hard on yourself. 

00:53:45
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:53:45
CLOE MEDANES Everybody makes mistakes, or I love you anyway, what could you do? 

00:53:50
TOM Yeah. 

00:53:50
JOANNE I think I, I do a lot of those. Um. 

00:53:50
CLOE MEDANES What would help? 

00:53:55
JOANNE I think it’s my immediate response sometimes. 

00:53:55
TOM Yeah, for me it’s the, and then we tight- you know, it’s the little touches, it’s the, you know, just this piece, that’s a big, you know. It doesn’t have to be a big. 

00:54:05
CLOE MEDANES (crosstalk)So show me how you do that. Show me. 

00:54:05
JOANNE (crosstalk)(ph)Have to do that But I’m not good at, yeah, I mean, I could, you know, I can definitely. 

00:54:10
TOM Yeah. 

00:54:10
JOANNE You know, it’s the(inaudible ). 

00:54:15
CLOE MEDANES That’s the way it is, there’s nobody here. Is that way you do it? 

00:54:20
JOANNE No. 

00:54:20
CLOE MEDANES No. How do you do it? 

00:54:20
JOANNE I, I, I’m not, I’m not good enough at the small touches, I’m better, I, I do a lot of words, and I need to, I think to approach more. 

00:54:30
CLOE MEDANES Touch more. 

00:54:30
JOANNE Tom’s very, he really is very um, physical, you know. 

00:54:35
CLOE MEDANES Ok, so let’s do a little thing together that you can practice at home. You can leave those pens here. And so stand closer together and close your eyes for a moment and each one put one hand on your own heart. 

00:54:50
TOM Mmmhmmm. 

00:54:50
CLOE MEDANES And breathe into your heart as you think about the love that you have for each other and the tolerance. 

00:55:00
TOM Mmmmm. 

00:55:00
CLOE MEDANES Take a moment to breathe deeply in your own heart. And now open your eyes and look at each other’s eyes. Look into each other’s eyes. And be totally present. And then put your other hand on the other person’s heart. And feel your hearts beating together. And continue looking deeply into each other’s eyes. 

00:55:25
TOM Mmmmm. 

00:55:30
CLOE MEDANES And breathe deeply together. And think of all the love between you that has carried you through so much. 

00:55:35
TOM Mmmhmm. 

00:55:35
CLOE MEDANES And you have overcome so many obstacles to be together and loving each other forever. And you know that when there’s hard times, you can always do this- breathe into each other’s heart, and look at each other, and you don’t need to say a word. The love is there. And the tolerance is there. And the forgiveness is there. Alright. One big hug. Let’s give them a big hand. 

00:56:20
