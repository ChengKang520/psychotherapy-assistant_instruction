WARNING FEDERAL LAW PROVIDES SEVERE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR UNAUTHORIZED REPRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, OR EXHIBITION OF COPYRIGHTED MOTION PICTURE PROGRAMS IN ANY FORM (TITLE 17, UNITED STATES CODE SECTION 50 lff). THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION INVESTIGATES ALLEGATIONS OF CRIMINAL COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT. TRIANGLE PRODUCTIONS Presents UNBALANCING A COUPLE a film by Jay Haley and Madeleine Richeport-Haley 

00:00:35
JAY HALEY Because there are many kinds of marital problems there are many ways to do therapy with them. This film shows one way to think about a problem and one way to intervene to bring about a change. The couple is in their late 20’s and they have been married seven years. They came to therapy because they were unhappy with each other and they were trying to decide whether to separate or stay together. Neither was willing to initiate a change. The therapist who was experienced in doing traditional therapy with couples and he was in training in brief therapy approaches. He had been taught that a therapy should be neutral and not side with one spouse against the other. For reasons of confidentiality, this film is performed by actors. They reproduced exactly what the participants say and do in the videotape sessions. The therapist does a typical introduction of the room. 

00:01:25
Thank you for coming in. I would like to say few things first about the room. As you can see there are some microphones and cameras around. Like to videotape so that after the session I can see if I’ve missed anything that might be useful. After the session I am… I will have a release form if you wish to sign it. And also you can see there is a two way mirror here. Sometimes some other members of the staff are sometimes behind there and if they hear anything or see anything that might be useful they will telephone me and I’ll talk to them and I’ll go talk with them and if something that I think that will be useful, I will share it with you. Sometimes if you have several people or more than one person working on a problem we find it can be more useful. 

00:02:15
JAY HALEY The couple came in expecting to discuss and reflect on their dissatisfactions with each other. They do that for a period of time. 

00:02:25
Let’s get back to this issue of you know… does she love you and what evidence do you have that she does love you? What evidence do you have that she doesn’t? I mean this is… this is not a court of law or court of appeals, but we have to have some evidence not just here say. 

00:02:40
STEVEN She absolutely avoids spending any time with me. She shows very little if any warmth or affection, physically or emotionally. 

00:02:50
CHARLENE That’s not true. 

00:02:50
STEVEN It’s true. 

00:02:50
That’s your perception. 

00:02:55
STEVEN I feel completely shed off from my life. What she is thinking, what she is feeling and there more about what’s going on in our life or what I hear to tell people on the telephone. I don’t feel that she wants to be around me at all and I think she is very close to moving out on her own away from me. Whatever it is, she doesn’t wanna be around me. I've tried real hard to behave, but and I don’t get any positive feedback at all. 

00:03:20
And how was it for you when she touched you just a minute ago? 

00:03:25
STEVEN I was very aware of that. 

00:03:25
But you didn’t respond. 

00:03:30
STEVEN No, I didn’t. She wouldn’t have done that at home. 

00:03:30
CHARLENE That’s a lie, an absolute lie. 

00:03:35
So you deny the evidence then? Well what evidence do you have that she does love you? 

00:03:45
STEVEN Well we are here and well we still live together. 

00:03:50
Well I can see that you are displeased. But I don’t see that you have any evidence, any real evidence that she does not love you. 

00:04:00
STEVEN I feel no emotion from her at all. 

00:04:00
Emotionally cut off. Well is… is that… if she is not interested in you is it possible she is interested in another man? 

00:04:10
STEVEN I don’t think that’s the problem, no. 

00:04:15
So there isn’t… there is not another man. So you feel you need more contact, but you are not getting it. 

00:04:20
STEVEN That’s right. I mean I feel like she is going through certain motions like this therapy, out of a sense of guilt or because the last step is hard one to say. 

00:04:30
Letting you down softly? 

00:04:35
STEVEN Perhaps letting us both down. Feeling responsibility to the marriage and anyway I don’t feel very much wanted. 

00:04:45
And… And how about you? How do you feel about when he says he does not love you and when he can’t say he loves you? 

00:04:55
CHARLENE Uh… I think he loves me. I know he says he hates me every once in a while, but he tells to kind of fly off the handle a lot. And what hurts me when he says that a lot. I think he loves me. I wish that he… the ways I want someone to show love is different from the ways he shows it and he is unwilling to show it the ways I wanted shown because he doesn’t feel that my ways are valid ways. I think we both have to come to terms with each other’s way of showing it. That’s basically true and that’s a big problem. 

00:05:40
Your styles? 

00:05:40
CHARLENE Yeah. To be able more readily to interpret the ways the love is shown. 

00:05:50
STEVEN That’s my speech. 

00:05:50
CHARLENE I know. I agree with you and I agree with you wholeheartedly. 

00:06:00
STEVEN You didn’t say a word. 

00:06:00
CHARLENE I did. I agree with you. 

00:06:00
STEVEN Say that. 

00:06:00
CHARLENE I said yes, when we were sitting there. I said you are right if you recall. I think he loves me. But he is losing patience with me and we are having a hard time right now. 

00:06:20
So do you feel you have to go after him again to court him again? 

00:06:25
CHARLENE I don’t even know a part of me doesn’t even want to. You know I feel like… like if he is not willing to make any changes. I am not willing to make any changes either. 

00:06:35
JAY HALEY Many of the couples follow communication rules. This couple follows the rule at the wife initiates what happens and the husband response. A couple can be satisfied with this rule but others can be dissatisfied. They find they cannot easily change that rule. Attempts to change are done according to the rule. They come to therapy for problems related to it. Even when deciding whether to go to therapy they follow the rule. The wife recommends therapy and the husband responds reluctantly. In many cases as in this one the wife pursued the husband in their courtship days and the husband responded to her. After marriage she wants him to initiate more and not just wait for her to act. He objects against that is not in their contract. The wife has the dilemma whether to go back to initiating what happens or wait for her husband to do so, with the possibility that he might never move toward her unless she asks for it. He initiates no independent action. Change is difficult to achieve when they are lacked in this rule. 

00:07:45
Your husband is in doubt as to whether or not you want to stay with him. Are you just being kind and going through the motions and is this marriage gonna go on and if so what we can do to resolve this issue? 

00:08:00
CHARLENE Well I can… I mean I can sort of stand apart and say okay I know I need to show him more affection, but it’s… it’s very hard for me to show that right now because I mean its… he is… I just feel that I mean it’s like he doesn’t know… I mean it’s a catch of 22. It’s like he doesn’t feel like I love… like I love him. So he is I mean neither of us are particularly thrilled about the idea of being vulnerable, nobody is. You know the anger that he expresses and the frustration that and the frustration at me, I take that and I make it worse. 

00:08:45
But you… 

00:08:50
CHARLENE I know, I know I could be more affectionate. 

00:08:50
Do you want this marriage to continue? 

00:08:55
CHARLENE Not the way it is now, no. 

00:08:55
What are you going to have to do to change? Is it worth the effort at the in the energy and can it? 

00:09:00
CHARLENE Well, I think it’s worth it. 

00:09:05
Are you willing to work at it? 

00:09:10
CHARLENE Yeah. 

00:09:10
So you feel that you have a an investment in this marriage to Steven? 

00:09:15
CHARLENE Well I don’t know if… I don’t know if an investment is the right word for it. 

00:09:20
But you are not ready to declare bankruptcy yeah. Is that what you are saying? 

00:09:25
CHARLENE No, yeah. I mean yeah. I have… have an emotional investment in this. 

00:09:30
Is… oh is it over with that Charlene has made two three years changes in her life. She is… She has become more independent. She doesn’t need you as much and she is in love with her career and her job and she doesn’t need you the life she did before as she is not the same person when you met. 

00:09:55
STEVEN I am not looking for dependent woman at all. It’s almost as she is not independent enough. She doesn’t stand out to me. She doesn’t talk to me. She is afraid to because I would be very bad. 

00:10:05
CHARLENE And he will win. 

00:10:10
STEVEN I don’t want my wife like that. It’s not interesting. I think very highly about my opinions, but also like dialogue, a lot. 

00:10:20
CHARLENE Then you have to understand why I feel a little ill at ease. 

00:10:25
I will step out and talk to my colleague, seems to me where to place in this marriage as to whether you to free to decide whether you want to continue or not and if so what’s the plan. So I’ll be right back. 

00:10:40
CHARLENE Okay. 

00:10:40
JAY HALEY It became obvious to the supervisor behind the mirror that change was not happening, only a conversation was taking place. The couple was willing to talk at length about their feelings and ideas, but the change some new action must take place. By behaving in a fair way with each spouse the therapy puts unintentionally legitimizing the rules of their relationship. The husband and wife each seem to be waiting for the other to do something. Together they are waiting for the therapist to do something. The therapist was waiting for the supervisor to do something. Something had to be done. The supervisor called the therapist to come behind the mirror for a consultation. In the conversation behind the mirror, the supervisor’s task was to change the behavior of the therapist so the couple could change. The supervisor decided to change the neutral posture of the therapist. He asks the therapist if he could be unfair? Could he choose one spouse and say that one was entirely wrong and the other was entirely right? The therapist said he could not do that because systemic research had shown the spouses in trouble equally cause the trouble, neither one is to blame. The supervisor agreed that research probably had shown that, but this was therapy and not research. Different rules and the theories apply. It was decided to decide against the husband. The wife could have been blamed but the husband being the responder would be more appropriate. It would also be easier for this therapist to go against the man and would be to join the man against the wife. The supervisor said the therapist was to join the wife by saying the husband is entirely to blame and must act in new ways. What helped was the supervisor saying that other therapists could be unfair. The therapist said that if other therapists could be unfair, he could be unfair. Once he accepted the plan he carried it out with enthusiasm. 

00:12:40
You… You should have a very clear in your mind as to whether this is going to get better or worse. Right now you are locked, you are… you are stuck and I think you need to take time. There’s no panic about this. It’s been going on for a while, changes you are going through, changes in your career, changes in your life. You are going into your 30’s pretty soon. I must say what I heard tonight Steven, you are in danger of losing your wife. I think that what you are doing is absolutely wrong. I think you are making the mess of things that you are pouting, that you are doing things to turn it off by not talking to her, by not being aggressive, by not seeking her out, by not… not courting her. I think you need to go back to your romance. Maybe… Maybe she did the courting I think now maybe it’s time you start courting her and you are driving all away. I think you've(ph) worked as long hours, not spending time with you, not… not communicating with you. If I had to make a choice right now I would have to say that you are absolutely wrong. It’s your fault and… and you’ve got to do the things if you want this woman as your wife. Because you are putting all the blame on ma'am, you really have to take responsibility for this and this is a good time of year because its spring and the sap is rising its… it’s the beginning of new life, new beginnings. This is the time for you to really convince yourself if you really want to win her you really have to make it very clear in your mind that… that you have done everything you can to win this woman as your wife. It’s like a second marriage. No fault of yours. 

00:14:15
JAY HALEY Anticipating a response is part of the strategy of therapy. The husband might say he didn’t feel affection toward his wife and so could not be nice to her. That was prevented by saying in advance that he should pretend he was in love with her and so could act. 

00:14:30
This means that you have to you know pretend at the beginning. The beginning is kind of hard for you because you are so mad, still feeling cheated or being ignored or bring hurt or slighted. You are going to have to pretend for the first week or so that you are in love with her. Go through the motions it’s almost like after you get into something you suddenly realize oh yeah this is kind of nice. Our marriage is getting better. I am going to put the responsibility on you. I know you won’t like what I am saying. It’s a hard message I am leaving you in and I don’t see that anything Charlene is doing is contributing toward it all. I just… I think that is not the case. 

00:15:15
CHARLENE I must be doing something. 

00:15:20
STEVEN Let’s talk about this. I think you’re bullshit. 

00:15:25
Well you… you really have to go after her, you’ve… you’ve to court her you really do. 

00:15:30
STEVEN She spends her time telling me that everything I’m and everything I do is bad, is evil. 

00:15:35
To convince her that is not, you… you’ve to convince her that by courting her, by… by going after her, by calling her during the day. 

00:15:40
STEVEN I call her during the day, I can’t get through. She never is available to answer the phone. She’s always busy. 

00:15:50
Take time often met her for lunch. Don’t wait, go after her. Don’t let her out of your sight. She is a prized possession. If this is the greatest thing in your life better than margarine then she is going to melt. She is going to disappear and you’ve to take the offensive and… and be aggressive and don’t fold under her criticism, she is just giving you a hard time. 

00:16:15
STEVEN Her criticism isn’t just… I don’t like it when you do that and I’m going out, I’m leaving. 

00:16:20
Go with her. 

00:16:20
STEVEN I’m not invited. 

00:16:20
Well you don’t have to wait for an invitation, you’re the man of the house. 

00:16:25
STEVEN She is never home. She comes on 8:30, 9 O’clock every night and I am the first one at home every night. What can I do? 

00:16:30
JAY HALEY When one observes a way for all blame she must come forward because she knows that’s not true. On the telephone the supervisor suggest that the therapist ask for specific behavior and not have an abstract discussions. 

00:16:45
STEVEN It's a fairly bold statement after one hour. 

00:16:45
Well by tomorrow what will you do so that Charlene does not slip through your fingers so that she is not moving away from you. What can you do tomorrow? 

00:17:00
STEVEN Give up everything I believe in. 

00:17:00
Well you can modify it. 

00:17:00
STEVEN No, I won't do that. 

00:17:05
Well what is it that would prevent you from… from… doing something tomorrow, the other day off tomorrow don’t you? 

00:17:10
STEVEN Yeah we will sort of have some obligations at work. 

00:17:15
Well what could you do tomorrow that would make Charlene think that you feel that she is the greatest thing in your life? 

00:17:20
STEVEN I don’t know anymore. 

00:17:25
Well you’re not sure you got to try at the beginning if you’re not sure. 

00:17:30
STEVEN There is certain type of person that she wants that I'm not, I never will be. 

00:17:30
Well can you just try for tomorrow? Can you… Can you just… Can you just be that way just for tomorrow? 

00:17:45
STEVEN I don’t know. 

00:17:45
Change I mean you’ve to take… you have to convince yourself that you can… you can change that you can modify yourself that you’re not fixed in concrete. You can modify your own behavior. Right now you guys are locked one of you has to change. By you’re not changing you’re preventing Charlene from responding to you. You… You have to take charge and be and court her. 

00:18:10
STEVEN I’ll tell you what I’ve to do and I’ve been doing for the past few weeks. I show a lot of interest in her work, but at the same time I’ve to be careful not to ask any questions that are sensitive or suggest criticism or suggest that maybe she is not perfect. It’s not allowed any one-sided dialogue and I… I’ve to believe as I think her parents are whatever you do is wonderful. I’m not that kind of person, not that kind of person about myself. 

00:18:35
That would be hard feeling you’ve to pretend that you’re a good listener. 

00:18:40
STEVEN I’m not allowed to ask questions. I can’t say what happened, what went on. I just have to say oh I’m sorry. You’re wonderful and whatever happened at work that’s bullshit. I’m not that kind of person. 

00:18:55
JAY HALEY The most extreme approach if the husband criticizes the wife, the therapist must say he doesn’t agree with that and such criticism is being rude to his wife. 

00:19:05
Well that’s not the type of person your wife is, I mean it’s almost as if you’re being rude to her. I mean if you would just ask her the who, what, where, why just to get the facts your wife would not be offended. 

00:19:15
STEVEN But I do. I know everything about her job. I know the names of the employees. I know what they do. I know what goes on during the day, but I’m not allowed to ask anything substantial. If something goes wrong and her boss is upset about something, I’m not allowed to you know. 

00:19:35
CHARLENE Because my boss yells at me and I’m upset. The last thing I need is for my husband to turn around and examine me in this situation. I just want to you say its okay. 

00:19:45
Just… Just to be a good listener and not use the third degree, that would be hard for you? 

00:19:50
STEVEN It would be. 

00:19:50
CHARLENE You can do it. 

00:19:50
STEVEN It’s not my personality. 

00:19:50
But you could learn that behavior or you just reflect back the times you know the feelings that you hear from… from her without giving a solution. What else could you do more to prove that Charlene is the woman that you love? You really have to take the change to take charge or it’s not going to happen. If you continue what you’re doing, you gonna drive her way. You… You must know what things have worked in the past to get into her heart. Because you’re a man of feelings, I know your feelings are strong. I can sense them. If you listen to her what else could you do? 

00:20:25
STEVEN I don’t know. 

00:20:25
JAY HALEY One risk of this extreme approach is that the husband must act or leave the marriage. When the husband gets thoughtful here, he seems to be deciding whether he wants the marriage. The wife become nervous worrying about what he’ll decide. The therapist goes on pushing. 

00:20:45
STEVEN I'm always there. 

00:20:45
You go after her. Don’t wait for Charlene to show up at your doorstep, go after her. Buy her a present, I mean you’ve… you’ve courted people before haven’t you? 

00:20:55
STEVEN I’ve brought her a present. 

00:21:00
CHARLENE He has brought me a present. 

00:21:00
Good, well what else can you do? Flowers, flowers that's a way into a women’s heart. I mean Valentine’s Day is over, but well you’ve got her a present that shows that you do, you really do care about her what… what… what can you do? Can you meet her tomorrow for lunch, supper? You’re courting him that’s his job. 

00:21:25
CHARLENE You’re hard on him. 

00:21:30
Well that this is something really important you know. I know it’s hard. I mean right now you probably mad as a devil at me right now, but I think you have to figure out a plan, a strategy to win Charlene. Do you go to shows? 

00:21:45
STEVEN We have. 

00:21:45
Can you get some tickets? Surprise her with tickets it could take off. I’ve some tickets come on babe, we are going to the show, but I’ve my work. Forget the work, you are coming with me now, take her by storm. Do you have to call the boss up to get permission to get her, to take off or what? I think you’re going to be surprised that after you’ve done it two or three times even if it’s just going through the motions. You might even be questioning as is it really gonna work? Is it against my values? Do I have to change until my life upside down for this? But I think this is a prize in here for you and I think you know what to do. It's getting you mobilize to do it. You can make such progress that one night you go home and make a pass at her. I think that she is gonna reject you because this has been a problem in your marriage before. I think it is all the more reason why you should have to work at it. Before you can become intimate, you really have to have some foreplay ahead of time during the day, things that you have in common. You just can’t jump into the sacks, so I wouldn’t be surprised that you do all this work and you’re not going to get any kind payoff or reward. But I think you might get rejection and I think if you work at it hard enough it will be okay. 

00:22:55
JAY HALEY The therapist mentions that he has experienced with couple therapy. When doing an unusual intervention, it is best to define oneself as experienced and not a novelist). 

00:23:05
I’ve seen a lot of couples, I do a lot of marriage therapy and I’ve seen this happen before. I expect as a work. 

00:23:10
STEVEN I don’t, I don’t. 

00:23:15
CHARLENE What can I do? 

00:23:15
You don’t have to do anything. 

00:23:15
CHARLENE That’s not fair. 

00:23:20
This is Steven’s job. 

00:23:20
CHARLENE He always say that he wouldn’t compromise. 

00:23:25
If he doesn’t compromise there is your answer right there. 

00:23:25
CHARLENE Well I… I hope he doesn’t mean it. 

00:23:30
Well just go and do the work. 

00:23:30
CHARLENE How come I don’t get to do anything. 

00:23:35
This is a man’s job. You… You there are things down the line that will be expected of you. You… You are not off the hook, but this is Steven’s two weeks to shine. 

00:23:45
JAY HALEY The therapist ignores the resistance of the husband and proceeds as if there is agreement on the plan. 

00:23:50
You have the task Steven of courting Charlene for the next two weeks. I want you to be as imaginative and creative as you possibly can be. Don’t wait to be asked. Don’t wait for her to make the first move as she has done here several times tonight. You have to become the initiative for the next two weeks then we will see what happens. What prevented from… from not working Steven? 

00:24:10
STEVEN Then I won’t do that, I won’t want to. 

00:24:15
That you’re stubborn? You… You… You don’t believe it will work? 

00:24:20
STEVEN No, I think it will work. I have no doubt about that. 

00:24:20
JAY HALEY When the husband admits this approach will work and make a happier marriage he is caught. 

00:24:25
Can you… Can you take the first step give in a little? 

00:24:30
STEVEN I just don’t think what’s going on here is representative of what’s going on at home. 

00:24:35
Okay, but I… I want you to change what happens right in here. What you just said gives me hope that… that you’ll do this. What kind of roses does Charlene really like? 

00:24:45
STEVEN She doesn’t like roses. 

00:24:45
CHARLENE I never said I didn’t like roses. 

00:24:50
STEVEN She prefers cut spring flowers. 

00:24:50
CHARLENE I never said I didn’t like roses. 

00:24:55
And you better find out what colors she likes. You better find that out. 

00:25:00
CHARLENE Ha…ha… 

00:25:05
Two Weeks Later 

00:25:05
JAY HALEY Two weeks later the therapist meets with the couple and ask for the report. He has cuddled them several times to make sure they are following the directive. Even when deciding who will report on the two weeks, the couple followed the initiating responding rule. 

00:25:20
Report on the two weeks now I’m going to give you the, the choice to… to go first because I want to hear from both of you. I understand you… you did some… some different things and you had two different kinds of experiences. So what probably say I… I found out that when I called you so go ahead. 

00:25:40
CHARLENE You want to start? 

00:25:40
STEVEN I don’t care. 

00:25:40
CHARLENE I always start. 

00:25:40
STEVEN I’ll go first. 

00:25:45
CHARLENE Okay. 

00:25:45
STEVEN How we are? There was a whole range of things here pretty much across whole spectrum. I think I was pretty good at doing the things that I was supposed to do. 

00:25:55
Precisely what was it that you did? I know that you’re doing some neat things. 

00:26:00
STEVEN Well I don’t think I did anything wild and crazy. I don't run any horse in the house or circuses but we went out to lunch once. 

00:26:05
And you arranged that? 

00:26:10
STEVEN Yeah. 

00:26:10
You didn’t wait for Charlene to… to do so you set it up yourself? 

00:26:15
STEVEN I took her to a restaurant everything… It was really a very nice restaurant. 

00:26:15
CHARLENE It was very nice. 

00:26:15
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:26:20
