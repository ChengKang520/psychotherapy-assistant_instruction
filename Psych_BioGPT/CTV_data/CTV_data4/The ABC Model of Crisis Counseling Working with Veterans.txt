KRISTI KANEL Hello! I'm Dr. Kristi Kanel, Professor of Human Services at California State University, Fullerton. In this video, I will be presenting a brief lecture on the ABC Model of Crisis Intervention, which I have been developing and revising over the past 30 years. A complete description of the model and its use with a variety of client populations can be found in the fifth edition of A Guide To Crisis Intervention, published by Cengage Learning. Following this lecture, I will be demonstrating this model with a client. The ABC Model of Crisis Intervention is a method of conducting very brief mental health interviews with clients whose functioning level has decreased following a psychosocial stressor, which I refer to as a precipitating event, and which has usually occurred within four weeks of the crisis state. It is a problem-focused approach in which the focus is identifying the cognitions of the client as they relate to the precipitating event, and then altering them to help decrease unmanageable feelings. In addition, providing community referrals and other resources such as reading material is essential in applying this model. The ABC Model is based on the definition of a crisis state as including the following: A precipitating event occurs, the client has thoughts and perceptions about this event that lead to unpleasant and unmanageable feelings which cause a decrease in functioning and normal coping mechanisms fail to help the client function. These aspects will be the focus of the crisis intervention. The goal of crisis work is to offer coping strategies and alter-cognitions in order to increase functioning to its normal or higher level: A, developing and maintaining rapport; follow the client. The foundation of the crisis intervention is the development of rapport. A state of understanding and comfort between client and counselor. As the client begins to feel the rapport, trust and openness follow, allowing the interview to proceed. Before delving into the client's personal world, the counselor must achieve this personal rapport. Before any work can be done, the client must feel understood and accepted by the counselor. People don't care what you know, and tell they know that you care. Everything the counselor asks or says to the client should be related to something the client has just said. So the client can experience that the counselor is actually listening, and not just thinking of things to say or following a preset list of questions. Use of these basic rapport, building communication skills invites clients to talk, brings calm control to the situation, allows them to talk about the facts of the situation, helps the counselor to hear and emphasis with the client's feelings and lets the client know that the counselor is concerned and respectful. There is no set order in using these skills. Counselors use in tuition and verbal following, and genuine reactions when responding to clients. Basic attending skills aren't interpretations or advise-giving, rather it means to enter the internal world of the client and let the client know you understand what he or she is really going through. Basic attending skills: Attending behaviors; These include things such as good eye contact, verbal following, minimal encourages and an interested posture. It's very important to follow what the client says and not bring in pre-thought out ideas. 

00:04:15
Minimal encouragers/ head nodding, solid eye contact 

00:04:15
KRISTI KANEL Otherwise, the client won't feel that what you're saying is relevant to where they are at. Minimal encouragers are things like nodding your head and saying ah-ha! It shows the client that you're interested and that you want them to keep talking. These are basic to any counseling process. Questioning; Open-ended questions: These types of questions invite clients to explore more of what they have spontaneously shared without categories imposed by the interviewer. They allow clients an opportunity to explore their thoughts and feelings without feeling interrogated by the counselor, which close-ended questions often do. Questions that begin with what and how are effective in allowing clients to explore their ideas and feelings and in moving the interview along, while gathering essential information about the nature of the crisis. Counselors should try to tie the questions to what the client has just said. Verbal following is essential in order to ask pointed open-ended questions as related to what the client just said. Whenever a client offers a new word or expresses energy behind what he or she says, the counselor can ask a question that helps him or her better understand the meaning of the word or the energy. Never assume that you know what the client means; inquire. Close-ended questions: These questions began with do, does, are, have and could. Notice that clients can respond to these with a simple yes or no. There is a time and place for this. Usually when a fact is needed and during suicide assessments. Although it is true that many counselors must complete forms for their agencies, this does not mean that the interview should be a series of close-ended questions. Interviewing close-ended questions with open-ended questions, reflections and paraphrasing usually allows counselors to complete intake forms for most agencies. Clarifying: Clarifications can be thought of as a form of soft close-ended questions. They are used when a counselor isn't quite sure what the client just said, because maybe the counselor missed a piece of information because the client was speaking too fast or presented so much information at once that counselor couldn't grasp it at all. The counselor restates in his or her own words what they thought they heard client say in a questioning manner, beginning the statement with are you saying or did you mean. It is used to clear up confusion or ambiguity, and thus avoid misunderstanding, and confirm the accuracy of what the counselor to heard. It is not meant to encourage the client to explore more of what we said, but simply to help counselors make sure they understood what was said. Paraphrasing: Paraphrasing is restating in the counsellor's own words what the client just said. This shows the client that the counselor understands the basic facts and thoughts of the situation. It establishes empathy and a non-judgmental stands. Because I have not approving or disapproving just restating. If the counselor didn't quite get what the client just said, the client has the opportunity to correct the counselor and present his or her ideas more clearly. Reflection of feelings, empathy is integral to achieving and maintaining rapport with clients. This means we enable to let clients know you understand their feelings. A reflection is a statement that reflects the effect of part or emotional tone of the client's message whether verbal or nonverbal. Reflection is best done immediately following an expression of nonverbal feelings. Like when a clients start crying, we can say this seems really painful. It could be done after they express their feeling verbally. If a client says, I feel really down, you could say, wow, it sounds like this really gets to you. So, that you're staying with that feeling and -- for them what they are saying. Keeping it short is very helpful too. It keeps the client focused on feelings and nothing else. Keep it simple to help them stay with the feeling. Don't add facts and thoughts, don't add because. This is a tendency to say you're feeling down, because you're mother said this to you. You keep them with the feeling more when you just reflect the feeling by itself. If counselors add cognitive or factual information after the reflection of feeling, the client might then focus on something other than the emotion. Summarization: The key purpose of summarization is to help another individual pull his or her thoughts together. A secondary purpose is to check on whether the counselor may have distorted the client's frame of reference. This is a statement that ties together most of the facts, thoughts and feelings presented in the interview. It's very useful when transitioning from B to the C section. It's very useful for beginning counselors as well. Sometimes they are blank and no -- know what to say. A summarization will help a client focus on something, that's important for them at that moment. So if I summarize facts and feelings, the client will be hearing it and will think, yeah, that's right, that's what I want to talk about. B, identifying the problem: Follow the model. After basic demographic information has been gathered and as rapport is developing, the counselor will need to start focusing on the client's presenting crisis. Keeping in mind the basic aspects of a crisis state is vital in identify the nature of the problem. These were mentioned at the beginning of this presentation. They will now be addressed more thoroughly. Identifying precipitating events. Shortly after the interview begins, the counselor seeks to find out about what happened to trigger the crisis, asking what happened that made you call for an appointment is appropriate. It is an opening for clients to tell what is going on with them. If they cannot think of any particular event that brought them in, the counselor is encouraged to probe further, explaining that understanding the trigger of the crisis aids in relieving the crisis state. It is vital to pinpoint the precipitating event in order to be able to understand the thoughts and feelings that brought the client in. No matter how much clients profess that nothing has happened really, something drove them to seek help. We must squeeze it out of them. They must see that their current state of emotional distress is tied to an actual event. Remember, the client's thoughts are related to this event. And if we don't know the event, we cannot properly explore thoughts about it, and then alter those thoughts; exploration of thoughts, cognitions, perceptions and meanings. Another thing we need to identify are the perceptions, thoughts and meanings about the situation. A good portion of this B section is involved with exploring these cognitions. We really want to understand the entire cognitive schema going on inside this person to get a full idea of what's going on, so we can later attempt to alter cognitions. We really can't alter cognitions unless we know what those cognitions are. Clients very rarely present with cognitions. It's very rare for a client to come in and say, I'm here because I'm thinking bad stuff about myself or my situation. So we generally have to ask many questions related to that. Asking questions such as these help to begin the cognitive exploratory process. How do you put it together in your head. What do you think about this. What does it mean to you that. What are you telling yourself about. What assumptions are you making about. Once the first thought is given by the client, the counselor must continue to inquire about deeper and relative thoughts. It is only when the counselor truly understands the whoever perceptions and thoughts that he or she can help the client think differently about the situation. Identifying emotional distress and functioning level. We also want to identify their emotional distress. Oftentimes clients present with emotional issues rather than a precipitating event. They will come in and say, I've been very depressed lately, or I have been feeling very scared or guilty. So it's not hard to get emotions out of people, because that's generally what brings them in. But we do want to make sure we attend to those feelings and understand them. And if clients do not tell us of their emotional distress, we need to inquire directly as to how they have been feeling. We also want to understand their functioning level. This also might bring somebody in. Maybe they present and say, I've been having difficulty in school. I can't concentrate on work. I haven't been able to eat or sleep lately. Oftentimes impairment and functioning will bring somebody in, and if that is what they began their session with, we start with that. And then we form our questions, so that we can access information about perceptions, subjective distress, precipitating events and functioning. We then tie them all together to get a clear picture of the crisis state. It is helpful to understand how their functioning level was prior to the crisis in order to evaluate the outcome of the crisis intervention. Remember, the goal of crisis intervention is to bring the client back to pre-crisis level of functioning. Making ethical checks: We also at some point may need to identify any ethical concerns. This information is typically a part of most intake forms for most agencies and modern health maintenance organizations. Ethical checks can be done as part of the interview rather than just thrown at the client. If rapport is built first clients tend to be more forthcoming about these vulnerable and sometimes scary areas. Suicide assessment is always a potential risk for people in crisis, so it's not inappropriate for any mental health professional ever to simply identify and assess whether the person has suicidal ideation, that is thoughts of suicide. If they do, you have to do a formal suicide assessment to understand the risk level. The sessions in the video will include a suicide assessment. Homicidal or abuse issues are other ethical checks that need to be done in a crisis interview. Being a danger to others has to be considered and we may have to do some reporting to the police if that's the case. This includes child abuse, elder abuse and disabled adult abuse. Another ethical concern has to do with medical or organic concerns and any serious mental illness. We have to be aware that if that's an issue we have to connect this person with appropriate physicians. This may also include those clients suffering from serious substance dependence or abuse as this may also require some involvement of a physician, other than just a mental health professional. Therapeutic Interactions: once we understand the crisis state, we can began to alter-cognitions. However I don't want to present this as a linear model, sometime we're altering cognitions as there are presented to us. It has to happen intuitively as the counselor starts to think about it. It has to be related and relevant to what the client says. While the sessions are being viewed by you there will subtitles, when one of these interactive statements is being made by me to help you follow along. Validation statements: one approach to altering cognitions is what we call validation statements. These let the client know what she is felling and experiencing is understandable, then it is difficult and that she is entitled to feel what she is feeling. So we want to make statements like, that is hard, that is difficult, totally understandable to be feeling like that, most people in this situation do feel this way. This will help the person not feel so abnormal like something's wrong with him. They will feel more connected, that you understand them and that you not judging them. In my hub clients not see themselves as sick, weak or bad. Educational statements: providing factual information is vital in every crisis. Clients often suffer merely because they lack or have incorrect knowledge about the situation. Thus, it is imperative for counselors to gather as much information as possible about each crisis situation either through formal academic course, books or supervision. Educational statements may include psychological, social and interpersonal dynamics, statistics or frequency of the problem. Counselors are passing down knowledge we learned in college to our clients. Empowering statements: For clients who are in crisis situations in which they feel violated, victimized or helpless. Empowering statements may help them take back personal power by making helpful choices now. These statements help them move from a position of feeling powerless to feeling that they have some control and choice in their life now. The goal is to change the mind step from victim to survivor. Reframing statements: Reframing is defining a situation differently from the way the client is defining it. It is a cognitive restructuring tactic that aims at changing the crisis from danger to opportunity. If we can believe that something positive or beneficial will be an outcome or result of the problem, we can usually integrate the difficult episode more easily. The counselor's responsibility is to be creative in finding the right reframe, which means actively searching the positive. This is an advanced technique that puts problem in a solvable form by changing the meanings of behaviors and situations and provides a new perspective which opens up new possibilities for change. Reframing is possible only if the counselors first understands fully the clients current frame of reference. Counselors can learn the client's frame of reference by asking direct questions such as how do you perceive the situation, what does it mean to you. Reframing offers a way out a problem that allows the person to preserve the integrity of the self and the family unit as well, because reframes are usually offered with the person's self-identity in mind, shame is reduced and self-integrity is preserved. Moving into C, once the counselor has identified the crisis and offered new ways of thinking about it a strong summarization is in order to help move smoothly into the final stage and get the client out the door in better shape than when they first walked in. C, Coping; The first step is exploring the client's own attempts at coping. The most important thing to remember about moving into this section is to have clients think about what they would like to do to begin to resolve the situation before the counselor starts offering ideas. By having the clients ponder their own ideas they're more likely to follow through with them. Narrative therapy has shown this to be effective in recent evidence based practice studies. It's also a starting point for me, the counselor, to think of different things for the client to do. The point is, I don't want them to resist my referrals and my interventions and if it comes from them, chances are they are going to follow through. I want to ask clients what they would like to do to get through this crisis. During the educational statements, I might have seeded some ideas that they may have been pondering, like educating them on the fact that codependency is so common that 12-step groups have been created to provide support for those living with an alcoholic or maybe I had educated the person about new techniques that people suffering from PTSD have been using such as EMDR. Often the client will respond to the question what do you think would be a good place to start or what do you think might help you by saying that that 12-step group I had mentioned sounds good, they might also give other ideas such as exercising or reading or writing. When they give me some ideas, I'm going to ask them for more. What are the things can you think of, I really want to thoroughly exhaust their inventory of what they'd like to do. Presenting alternative coping behaviors: Once I hear what they'd like to do, I often then have some ideas on what I think they should do. I also have ideas on what I think they could do based on my experience and knowledge of what would really work in various situations. So then I might began offering the client ideas after that. I might refer them to a support group. Support groups are very valuable. They are usually groups run by a professional with people going through the same situation. And these different -- these are different from 12-step groups or mutual self-help groups. These are groups usually not run by a therapist. You might have heard of some like Alcoholics Anonymous, Al-Anon, Overeaters Anonymous. These 12 -step groups are formed and they are very useful as referrals, because they are usually very low fee or no fee at all. You can access them seven days a week, three to four times a day. So they are an excellent resource for people who needs something that is useful, effective and very cost effective. I might refer them for a medication evaluation by a psychiatrist, if I really felt there was some serious symptoms going on, severe depression or anything sever like a panic disorder or severe anxiety disorder. I might encourage them to get a physical examination from their own doctor if that seems to be an issue. If I were working with a victim of rape, I might have already seeded the idea of getting a medical exam earlier. I might recommend legal assistance, perhaps they need help getting a restraining order or maybe there is a child custody situation, I might encourage them to seek a lawyer for that. Often in an empowerment statement to a victim of domestic violence, I talk about her choices. One being to press charges. There are many agencies and shelters or other clinicians that I might refer them to, such as someone who specializes a marriage counselling or family counselling or other specialties; maybe EMDR which is Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing for people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Sometimes when encouraging clients to explore new coping, they mention something that has worked in the past. I might encourage them to do this again, at this point or offer ideas that I think might such as journaling, reading, exercising, attending classes and a multitude of other things. Commitment and follow up: Once I've given referrals and I have given my ideas, I want to get a commitment from this client that they're going to do this, and I want to establish some follow-up. Before I end the session I want to make sure the client has a definite plan of action and is committed to following through with that action. If clients presented at low risk or middle risk suicide I would make a no suicide contract before they leave the office. I would also set up a specific time to speak again.

KRISTI KANEL This client presents with being in crisis after he was terminated from his job. Of course we could just focus on the loss of a job and how it leaves him feeling financially insecure and without identity. However, he lost his job because the place of employment changed its insurance carrier which didn't want to ensure the client due to his longstanding history of PTSD. This triggered a spiral-down effect and functioning due to negative cognitive statements the client is making about himself related to the PTSD. This moves him into a discussion of why he still has PTSD, how he got it in the first place and how other areas of his life are affected. This client served as a snipper in several operations and had been deployed four times for service. According to the latest research, PTSD is strongest when soldiers have been deployed four times or more. Another issue particular to this type of client is the fact that he had been physically abused as a child. Studies have shown that impulsive aggression was over-represented among veterans with PTSD and that PTSD was stronger in veterans who had been abused as children. He has struggled with this type of aggression. In recent years clinicians and social workers have been using the terms invisible wounds and combat stress injuries when talking about three very common disorders that veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan war struggle with, such as PTSD, depression and suicide and traumatic brain injury. This client has suffered from all three of these casualties. As more and more veterans returned, we are learning about issues specific to this group of veterans that differ from other veterans. One issue has to do with the treatment received at the veteran administration. Virtual reality exposure is common for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan. For this client it was not effective, leading to worsening of symptoms. Treatment frustration then becomes another issue to deal with in crisis work. It becomes vital for crisis counselors working with this population to be tuned in to new and evolving treatment approaches and resources. Lastly, much research has been focusing on the issues facing the families of these veterans; the children and spouses are dealing with secondary traumatization and showing difficulties in reintegrating the veteran back into the family upon post-deployment. While the VA does offer resiliency training and the debriefing for families and the veteran, it may not always be enough or effective. It is possible that military culture inhibits veterans to fully disclose their issues for fee of seeming weak or like a complainer which goes against everything they were taught in order to have the identity of a good solider. In recent years I have worked with several community agencies that are creating community-based services for veterans and their families. Once all counselors and social workers become educated about the particular needs of this population, they will no longer have to rely solely on the VA for mental health services. Competent mental health services may then be provided by general practitioners to veterans without fear that the military commanders will hold their illnesses against them. Additionally, veterans may find it easier to get into treatment faster and work through issues more quickly. Community counselors may be well-suited to work on helping the families adjust to having the veteran back home once they become knowledgeable about the issues involved in military service, PTSD, depression, suicide and traumatic brain injury. Hi Tai, I am so glad you are able to join me today for the session. We've been talking and I know there are somethings that have been distressing you lately. Would you like to open up and start talking about what's going on with you? 

00:28:50
UNKNOWN Sure, recent incidents of because I have always been a real advocate of veterans and PTSD and sharing being able just to be open with it, like to my co-workers, friends, family, so because for a long time I felt like I was a monster looked upon by society for what I did. 

00:29:10
Open-ended questions to begin cognitive 

00:29:10
exploration "Monster" 

00:29:10
KRISTI KANEL What do you mean by monster? That's an important word you just used? 

00:29:20
UNKNOWN Well, because sometimes when we're -- when we come back from deployments, everyone looks at you, that's either -- you get the typical same two questions. Did you kill anybody? And then, if you say yes or no depending on your -- they are actually, either they look at you like you're making up the stories or how could you do that? 

00:29:40
Identifying emotional distress as related to 

00:29:40
precipitating event - people asking if he killed anyone 

00:29:40
KRISTI KANEL What does it feel like when people ask you that question? 

00:29:45
UNKNOWN Really uncomfortable, even to the point of -- when someone says thank you for your service, I am slowly coming to the grips of saying you are welcome, but it makes me feel really awkward. 

00:30:00
Cognitive Exploration, verbal following 

00:30:00
KRISTI KANEL What about thank for your services makes you feel particularly awkward? 

00:30:05
UNKNOWN Just inside it sounds like a kind of, that I did it to become -- to get the title of hero or like I did it for the thank you's and for the glorification, awards and all that not -- 

00:30:20
KRISTI KANEL And you are saying that's not why you did it? 

00:30:20
UNKNOWN That's not why I did it. And -- 

00:30:25
KRISTI KANEL So you don't like that term hero? 

00:30:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, the heroes are the one that they can't come back. 

00:30:30
KRISTI KANEL How so? 

00:30:35
UNKNOWN They gave up their life for me and it's just hard to go through life everyday not think about them, and also not think about the once you have taken. And when you become a parent you start looking at your children and you start thinking those lives that I have taken what's -- what could happen to them, what could -- did they have children. You start thinking all these fresh and then -- 

00:31:05
KRISTI KANEL Have you been thinking lately about some of the lives you have taken? 

00:31:10
UNKNOWN Every single one of them. It's very personal and it's difficult, especially around holidays, any type there is -- any holiday when there is a family gathering, I'll go to my in-laws and I kind of felt out of place, because I feel like I don't deserve to be there, because I have taken that right from someone else from being there, being with their family. 

00:31:30
Clarification 

00:31:30
KRISTI KANEL So, you are thinking because you took the life of somebody and their ability to be with their family you don't deserve to be with your family? 

00:31:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, it's an awkward word, sense of repentance, so I try to give blood, I give platelets whatever I could do to give back symbolism of life, so. 

00:31:55
Another attempt to identifying emotional distress 

00:31:55
KRISTI KANEL What emotion or what feeling would you put with that when you repentance, what is that feeling? 

00:32:05
UNKNOWN It's a feeling, because I've taught myself not to feel. So it's a feeling. 

00:32:10
KRISTI KANEL But it's hard for you to place another feeling like -- 

00:32:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, the only way I could really have feeling is the adrenaline rush of thinking about being back with my brothers or sadness remorse, those feeling are easy to tap into. 

00:32:30
KRISTI KANEL Is that what you are saying you feel sadness and remorse? 

00:32:30
UNKNOWN Sadness, depression and remorse because it's easy to get to those places, it's hard to find the ray of light and stuff. 

00:32:40
Reflection 

00:32:40
KRISTI KANEL So you are saying that you feel sad, remorse, depression, but you don't feel joy or some that way of light? 

00:32:50
UNKNOWN Only when I am with my kids. 

00:32:50
KRISTI KANEL When you are with your kids you do feel that? 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN But then I start look at them and my mind starts taking me like what, did you take this opportunity away from someone else. 

00:33:00
KRISTI KANEL So even when you are with your children feeling joy, it kind of fades if you think about other people not been able to be with their children? 

00:33:10
paraphrasing 

00:33:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, or even when my teenager, she is about to graduate high school and I look at her and I know some of my teenagers, they are culturally doing what they were told to do, and I can just have a hard time of saying someone her age could be fighting against the marine or -- in my case the marines, but someone her age or even younger and that's kind of disturbing. 

00:33:40
Cognitive Exploration "Disturbing" 

00:33:40
KRISTI KANEL What makes that disturbing for you? 

00:33:45
UNKNOWN Because I try to give my kids joy, happiness let them live their life of typical teenager, American teenager, American toddler, child and school. And when reflect back on what I did and taken away, yeah, it's a different part of the world but it's hard to really put -- because I'm projecting my cultural on to them, so even though they may never have those Prom dates or activities in the American culture, I'm projecting it on those faces and that's make me feel more remorse, because even though they may never have been education, or high school like a basic education, I am so projected in what I know on to them. 

00:34:40
KRISTI KANEL So now you have been back from service for how long now? 

00:34:50
UNKNOWN I have been back for 14 years. 

00:34:55
KRISTI KANEL 14 years. 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN And it didn't really hit me until my son was born. 

00:35:00
KRISTI KANEL And when was your son born? 

00:35:00
UNKNOWN He was actually April 21st and he will be 5. 

00:35:05
KRISTI KANEL So he's have birthday coming up, doesn't he? 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:35:10
KRISTI KANEL And so you've been struggling since then, more than ever with these feelings of remorse? 

00:35:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, because I have my older step-daughter but I am adopted her so doesn't matter. My seven-year-old daughter, it didn't really affect me, because as a girl but when I held my son for the first time it triggered things I have done to, isn't always the way he reacted, triggered everything and I found myself deep in a tunnel I couldn't get out I tried to repress PTSD for so many years. My ex-wife told me to keep it quiet, don't tell anybody. 

00:35:55
Symptom of PTSD "Triggers" 

00:35:55
Identifying most current precipitating event related 

00:35:55
ro presenting idea of being a monster 

00:35:55
KRISTI KANEL Then it gets back to what happened recently at your previous job, you let them know you had PTSD. 

00:36:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, it keeps on -- it seems like it's a strong effect of the monster. Like my wife projected -- 

00:36:05
KRISTI KANEL But your job didn't -- you've got fired from your job because that you had PTSD and the insurance carrier didn't want to cover you something like that. 

00:36:15
UNKNOWN Well what it was is, there I was in a position, I have been there for like several years, five years and I was about to get promoted and what happens is when they get promoted to like associate level, they take out a life insurance policy on you and then one for your family. Well, around about way they found out that someone with PTSD, major depression is a high risk factor and they made up a case that wasn't just for and they terminated me and made me sign a non-disclosure termination. So I never knew what -- I was called into the -- called into the office one day, here is your check, we'll send your personal stuff and everyone knew I was very adamant about awareness of PTSD and the suicide rates within veterans and the fundies and what programs are working, which programs aren't and I was very active in that, but after that happen to me I was nervous to talk about it again, because the same reaction I got from my ex-wife. 

00:37:20
KRISTI KANEL Understandable. 

00:37:20
UNKNOWN Say, now it's like my job, so now it's like do I tell my new job about this, like why I have to go to my therapy sessions I am just going to doctor, why you are going to doctor every week. I am not comfortable with sharing anyone because it's used against me. 

00:37:40
Suicide assessment 

00:37:40
KRISTI KANEL You said that earlier about the depression and suicide. Have you been thinking of suicide recently. 

00:37:50
UNKNOWN No. 

00:37:50
KRISTI KANEL No. Okay -- 

00:37:50
UNKNOWN That's one thing I have always -- 

00:37:50
KRISTI KANEL You're done with that or -- 

00:37:55
UNKNOWN It's not really suicide that I ever think because suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. 

00:38:00
KRISTI KANEL Right, exactly. 

00:38:00
Symptom of PTSD "Isolation" 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN It's more of, I want to be left alone on an island by myself. I don't want to be around people, I can't, I go to Disney Land for my kids, but it's the worst day in my life, I don't like crowd, I don't like people I am sorry to say I have bias against certain cultural, background, smells, noise and that's not right for my kids so I pushed through it and then at night I lay awake all night long trying to relax from it, so. 

00:38:30
KRISTI KANEL  So this -- so there is a lot of complicated things going on for you, it seems do you sometimes feel very complicated, there is so much that all of this is so connected together. 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN It's complicated and so much goes on at night, that's why now I am actually on medication to help me slow my mind down, because I would lay awake in bed and images will be rolling to my head all night, what is this, what if that, what if this reenacting scenarios. And then for a long time I was wondering why did they let me go, why did they make me sign a non-disclosure and I recently found out all this information. 

00:39:15
Symptom of PTSD " Recurrent images" 

00:39:15
KRISTI KANEL That it was because of the PTSD? 

00:39:20
UNKNOWN It was because of the insurance, because they did promote the next month and they had all the promotions, and then -- 

00:39:25
KRISTI KANEL And then knowing that, that triggered you to start thinking again that, like you are a monster. 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN So I've -- 

00:39:30
KRISTI KANEL So that word monster, that's really a huge factor. 

00:39:35
UNKNOWN I've had five years of therapy that started building my confidence up to be make this aware and then also one little act like that can regress me that I don't want talk about it. It's awkward to talk about it and that term monster it's come back now. 

00:39:50
KRISTI KANEL Right, and the meaning behind that, meaning what, what does monster mean to you? 

00:39:55
Cognitive Exploration 

00:39:55
UNKNOWN Someone scary, someone you are scared to look at, you can't look in your eye, you can't trust, you can respect. They are just to cause pain, suffering. 

00:40:10
KRISTI KANEL And that's how you are perceiving yourself, so that's how other people see you or do you see yourself like that? 

00:40:15
UNKNOWN That's how other people see me. 

00:40:20
KRISTI KANEL But that's not how you see yourself. 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN No, that's why there is a nick name I gave my son, I call him Boo, based upon the movies, because that monster is really a nice guy, so I have always called them Boo based upon that, because I have always tried to not be a monster and I'll play with these action figures, I don't go in foreign, I'll go into his world because God knows minds are pretty jacked-up. 

00:40:45
KRISTI KANEL But that isolation from people sounds like it's in part because you are thinking they're going to think you are monster? 

00:40:50
UNKNOWN Oh well, I even had family members when I got with my -- when I got re-married and I had some family members that wouldn't allow me to be in the room with their kids because they -- because I was very, I recall about my PTSD and they would looked upon me as oh, he could snap anytime and like take my kids out there. 

00:41:15
KRISTI KANEL What are your thoughts about that snapping anytime. 

00:41:20
Symptom of PTSD "Hyperaltertness" 

00:41:20
UNKNOWN My reactions when I have issues hyper alertness is, you actually want me around because I become like super -- like a superhero like looking for everyone's safety, it's not that I am scared, it's not that, oh, I hear fireworks, I get scared, I get on high alert, so I will get up, walk around and make sure everything is locked, secured, be like. 

00:41:45
KRISTI KANEL That's certainly a positive spin on it? 

00:41:50
UNKNOWN But -- that's but sometimes -- 

00:41:50
KRISTI KANEL And other people -- you are saying other people won't see that. 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN Because in the other -- in media sometimes, you hear about the negative aspects of PTSD or he was a former marine that had suffered PTSD and he just went in on a shooting spree and that negative media hype puts in perspectives of people that believe everything they see on TV and -- 

00:42:15
KRISTI KANEL But in your mind, you did not perceive yourself as somebody that's going to snap or blow up or do anything like that. 

00:42:20
UNKNOWN No, I've already done that, I've really done my time doing that, I just -- 

00:42:25
KRISTI KANEL And that's just not something you do now? 

00:42:25
Symptom of PTSD "Crying fits" 

00:42:25
UNKNOWN No, I get upset and I just -- like when I first triggered the PTSD started, I would just start going into a crying wit for no apparent reason. I will just start crying, I would see my son or some triggers and I didn't know what was going on. They wanted go to -- help, I don't want to get on meds, because I don't want. You had that stereotype of oh, you have to be on medication, you are a veteran that because the whole stigma that they projected on to the Vietnam veterans. 

00:42:55
KRISTI KANEL  Sure. 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN So that's still rolling into this slightly that people, oh you are on meds, oh, you must -- everyone not honor me must be crazy, because one thing I can't stay -- 

00:43:10
KRISTI KANEL You have a lot of perceptions about how other people see you and I am not so sure those are also accurate. 

00:43:15
UNKNOWN No, I know they are not accurate. My logical size know it's accurate, my emotional side is like. 

00:43:25
KRISTI KANEL Well, that to me is a positive step that if you know that the way you are thinking isn't necessarily how other people think. 

00:43:30
UNKNOWN Others take five years to get to that point. 

00:43:35
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Hey, you got there. 

00:43:35
UNKNOWN But when you are told that it reacts, all those old feelings come back and say I told you so, you are a monster. 

00:43:45
KRISTI KANEL Because of this insurance company situation. 

00:43:45
UNKNOWN  Yeah. 

00:43:50
KRISTI KANEL And so that kind of has re-triggered these feelings that somehow you are not going to be acceptable or people are going to judge you. 

00:43:55
Symptom of PTSD "Agitation" 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN Sleepless nights again, couldn't agitate easily but just why to be removed like, I don't like when -- 

00:44:05
KRISTI KANEL But you are able to function at work okay, at least to that, that's not effective? 

00:44:10
Identifying impairment in functioning at work 

00:44:10
UNKNOWN Well, so work -- I just focused on what the job, just like on record, what they taught us is focus on the job, machines first, welfare second, so 

00:44:20
KRISTI KANEL As you got a new job, it's just so -- they -- but you don't want to tell them. 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN No, I don't want to because I wanted to point where I want to educate people but I don't want to because I like my job, I like my the new firm on that right now. 

00:44:35
KRISTI KANEL If you could educate people, what would you want to educate them on? 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN Just resolve stuff, that we did stuff to protect them from seeing it ever, that's why we really did it is, we didn't do it for the like I said the medals, the rank. We did just to protect the ones we love and our future loved ones and did it for the guy next to me because through, he get on deployment and then only thing, it's not really the mission, it's just to get home. But when you come back home it's -- home is not the same any more. When I came back from Somalia I couldn't relate to any of my friends. 

00:45:25
Impairment in relationship functioning 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN People I knew a year ago was in high school with the year prior, I couldn't even talk to them until let's say, I still can't talk to people of my age, I just can't relate and I serve a veteran, where it like myself 

00:45:40
KRISTI KANEL What's the difference now between you and people of your age, let's say? Where do you see the biggest gap is? 

00:45:50
UNKNOWN They don't appreciate life, they don't appreciate living life to its -- like they take -- they take advantage of opportunities that are given to them, just like if a college student is paying his own way to college or her way and then they have a friend that their parents are paying it, I guarantee that kid that's paying his own way is studying harder than the one that's being given the opportunity for college. 

00:46:20
Identifying emotional distress 

00:46:20
KRISTI KANEL How does that make you feel when you think about people not, I don't know taking advantage of resources and what is offered to them. So when you perceive that about people what feeling goes along with that. 

00:46:40
Symptom of PTSD "Numbing" 

00:46:40
UNKNOWN Honestly, I just shut it -- shut down the emotions I don't -- I don't care anymore. It's, I tried, I tried to make a better world and -- but that optimism and hope I left overseas, it didn't come back with me. 

00:46:55
KRISTI KANEL That sounds like possible of foundation of some of your depression feeling hopeless and negative about the world. 

00:47:05
Symptoms of PTSD "Hopelessness" "Negativity" 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:47:05
KRISTI KANEL At least, it doesn't move you into suicide anymore. 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN No, but it's -- 

00:47:10
KRISTI KANEL But it does make you feel depressed and you shut down feelings and feel hopeless. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN I recall, find the darkest room, just sit in there and I interact and for the first six months, my son's life, anyone with you can do them, and knowing that as a dad say, I know he won't know it in his memory unless someone tells him, but knowing that, it makes me feel like a -- I felt really as a father. Even though I logically, in my mind -- and oh, I could be myself up, it's just because my dragon started -- 

00:47:50
KRISTI KANEL You do realize that you are suffering from a serious post-traumatic stress disorder and depression and you have TBI, Traumatic brain injury. Do you believe that has anybody talked to you about possibly experiencing that? 

00:48:05
3 Invisible wounds PTSD, Depression, TBI 

00:48:05
UNKNOWN Possibly, I have been near -- near where you hear the cracker of the bullet, you may hear grenades where my head rattles, I have constant migraines. 

00:48:15
Education Statements 

00:48:15
KRISTI KANEL So that has major you effects on your physical, your brain functioning, the PTSD certainly impairs brain functioning. We know that when people expose to trauma it does have an effect neurologically, the depression, all of that has -- you don't give yourself very much slack, do you? 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN Well even trauma, even the medicines like, they are like oh, you will gain weight -- you have weigh gain no matter what you do, and I have gained 80 pounds and that's so frustrating on this obviously like people say oh! you are marine, you don't look like one. Well if you look at all -- most of veteran marines and through medications, they have -- their marine core chest has fallen to their belly. 

00:49:00
KRISTI KANEL Now the medication, that is one of the side effects. 

00:49:00
UNKNOWN And it's frustrating. 

00:49:05
KRISTI KANEL That's very frustrating. A lot of this is frustrating, because you go there to protect the country, you trying to help your fellow comrades and arms, you think you're doing good stuff, you're doing what you're trained to do, you do a good job of it, then you come back and -- 

00:49:20
Validation Statements 

00:49:20
UNKNOWN It's like a baseball bat and like even right now it's kind of uncomfortable, like even with the studio staff here, it's I am more worried about not by well being or it's what are they thinking, like people behind the camera crew, it's the whole crew -- 

00:49:35
KRISTI KANEL What do you think they might be thinking? 

00:49:45
UNKNOWN Well, he is pretty jacked-up or I don't know it's just -- 

00:49:50
KRISTI KANEL Doesn't feel like to me that you accept that people might have some understanding or compassion or appreciation of you. You don't see that part from other people. 

00:50:00
UNKNOWN I don't receive it, even if it might be given to me, I don't receive it because I've learned how to switch compassion off, so -- 

00:50:10
KRISTI KANEL What would make you switch compassion off? 

00:50:10
UNKNOWN I really don't know, I don't know right now. Play with my son, that's compassion. Play with my daughter, teaching my elders how to drive. 

00:50:25
KRISTI KANEL But it sounds like you won't -- that you don't -- that maybe you are -- you don't like it that people might judge you or think negative stuff about you and yet if somebody wants to feel good towards you and appreciate you, you also -- it sounds like you reject that. 

00:50:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, I am playing the odds, because -- 

00:50:45
KRISTI KANEL What does you mean by that? 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN In my head, I am playing the odds of, well most people will reject or look upon you strangely, awkwardly and they are just telling you, thank you for your service, because they may feel like they are obligated to say that in society. That's my thought process as there are they feel like they are obligated to say thank you, to my service to you. Because they won't -- they don't want to be perceived as non-patriotic. 

00:51:20
KRISTI KANEL So any concern or compassion someone had for you in your mind, it's just somebody trying to be patriotic, it's not because they would truly care and appreciate you in what you have done, because you put yourself in an incubator for PTSD by doing the work you have done and so it's an occupational hazard that you put yourself into and so the fact that you've come back and you are suffering is not to be unexpected first of all, and so you are thinking that people would not appreciate that and understand that. 

00:51:55
Educational Statements 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, and then like I have some friends that their kids have joined the military. So they say, well go talk to him and I will talk to the parents and my friends' parents or the teenager and I go I want you to know one thing, you're joining the military to learn how to kill, it is your job to bake the other guy die for their country, that the whole purpose of the military, not the college fund, not the uniform, not the being the hero or looked upon on the Veterans' Day as hero, it's to train to kill and if you accept that, that's -- that will get you through it, if not, you are not going to make it through it. 

00:52:35
KRISTI KANEL So that, that gets back to what we started to -- 

00:52:40
UNKNOWN And then the harshness of that, people look me like, oh my god, how can you say that, because I am not putting blinders on people, I want people to know, that's the whole purpose of the military. 

00:52:50
KRISTI KANEL And I suspect, because this is what we started with today that, the facts that you had to kill people, it's part of your job, that, that is something that maybe you believe other people judge you about or that's what make -- is that what makes you a monster or does having -- that's why I'm not sure what makes you the monster --. 

00:53:10
UNKNOWN I can tell you exact. 

00:53:10
KRISTI KANEL or the PTSD. 

00:53:10
UNKNOWN I can tell you exactly when the first time I feel like a monster. Came back from my first deployment, felt really bad, went to a priest, confession. And I was told, I'm going to hell, because that was sanctioned by God. If someone that's supposed to be so forgiving can tell you you're going to hell, how's a normal person out there going to look upon you if spiritual guidance tells you something that you could, now you're going to say of -- they think this, what's the other people thinking? And ever since that incident, I've always looked upon that. So people will say well, you served the military. Yeah, I served. I don't want to go into detail. 

00:54:05
KRISTI KANEL Well, you've -- you've done stuff that the average person never has to do or never even knows what that's like to do. 

00:54:15
UNKNOWN But, that's my job is to keep it from them to. That's how I feel it is. It's -- I don't need to make a movie or write a book. I don't need to see it. People shouldn't see that role is -- people always say, oh! that movie is so realistic. Yeah, it's so realistic, I can't even watch them because, I'll have night terrors for two to three days, and -- 

00:54:40
KRISTI KANEL You're talking about American Sniper? 

00:54:45
UNKNOWN American Sniper, The Finest Hour, those similarly the movies or based upon. You know, those guys technically you will hear or so, not taking anything away from them. But my perception was, I did what I did not to have people see that. 

00:55:00
KRISTI KANEL You did what you did because it was your job. 

00:55:05
UNKNOWN But I joined in the military knowing that I was going to see that stuff. 

00:55:10
KRISTI KANEL But you joined the military to there was a purpose behind you joining in the first place. 

00:55:15
UNKNOWN To be the knight in shining armor. But also, I was always taught, you keep it in. 

00:55:30
KRISTI KANEL And keeping it in can have some pretty negative effects. 

00:55:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:55:35
Reframing 

00:55:35
KRISTI KANEL Because if you chop off a part of yourself, you chop off your feeling, you chop off who you are, you're -- you don't get to be the full person. You're like half a person, you're not a whole you and so -- so, I'm thrilled that you have been going to counseling to try to integrate it and bring it back in just a little bit. Because, anything you chop off it, it's not all of you that -- all that experience you had, makes you who you are. And if -- if there is a sense of -- I got to cut off of my arm or cut off a piece of me, you're not -- it's not the whole person yet. Maybe you didn't have a leg blown off or an arm blown off. But you had -- your emotions have been cut off or blown off. You have a different type of casualty than just appear physical casualty. And that's why I'm really glad you've been going to counseling, you know, to help -- it's the only thing I know that can help with it. And I understand you're struggling now. 

00:56:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, change of insurance and trying to find other counselors that know how to handle with hyper alertness, PTSD stuff like that, and it's -- it's hard to open up, it's harder to open up like I had a therapist for five years, then I got a new one. But then, insurance changed, now they're out of the network, so now I have to open up all those rooms again, which I was working on compartmentalizing. Now it's like, got to go share again. 

00:57:15
Begin C: Coping 

00:57:15
KRISTI KANEL How do you -- what do you think you can do to make that process work better for you? Make it something that's not such a strain or a challenge for you. 

00:57:30
UNKNOWN Subsidize or something and he you will say well the VA. I can go on about bad experiences from that group, because they are not military doctors. 

00:57:40
KRISTI KANEL How do you feel about the -- that you continuing to do your medication? 

00:57:45
UNKNOWN I want -- 

00:57:45
KRISTI KANEL You're okay with it, I know you complained about it, but it helps? 

00:57:50
UNKNOWN I know it helps. But, knowing that I'm on medication kind of sucks, sorry to be blunt. 

00:58:00
KRISTI KANEL Well, I mean, -- 

00:58:00
UNKNOWN Especially when like -- if you're having a bad day, everyone has bad days. But then you hear that, did you take your meds today, that's the worst thing to say to someone on medication. 

00:58:10
KRISTI KANEL Right. 

00:58:10
UNKNOWN Did you take your -- you know it, I'm just having a bad day. I just want to be left alone. I wanted say here with my sketch book, I draw and just cry if I want. Doesn't mean I didn't take my meds. 

00:58:25
Substance abuse assessment 

00:58:25
KRISTI KANEL Exactly. One of the concerns that we -- that I have or other -- you might have is, many veterans are like abusing their medications like if they get prescription pills, they're using that to like -- like really get high or numb themselves is -- 

00:58:45
UNKNOWN I had -- 

00:58:45
KRISTI KANEL Have you struggled at all with any of that? 

00:58:45
UNKNOWN I had -- no, I figure something like very conscious, because alcoholism and drug abuse for instance is in my family. So, I was always very knowledgeable what that -- like I would research the medications before I got on it or when they say, don't take with alcohol, I actually changed my whole habit of got rid of the Listerine in the house. 

00:59:05
KRISTI KANEL Okay, so you -- 

00:59:05
UNKNOWN So, stuff like that. 

00:59:10
KRISTI KANEL You're not doing any drugs or alcohol like that that's -- 

00:59:10
UNKNOWN No. 

00:59:10
KRISTI KANEL So, that you -- well, you're relying on prescription, medication to help with night terrors and depression, I'm assuming. 

00:59:20
UNKNOWN Correct. 

00:59:20
> Trying to get commitment 

00:59:20
KRISTI KANEL Okay and you're going to continue to do that, you're going to keep looking for somebody. 

00:59:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, because my therapist -- my previous therapist said, you know what, I know you want to be offered, but if it works, it probably going to be on for rest of your life. 

00:59:35
KRISTI KANEL And you're right and that doesn't mean that you won't sometimes just feel depressed and cry and need to sort through and work through some of that stuff. 

00:59:40
Things NOT to say to a veteran 

00:59:40
Things NOT to say to a veteran 

00:59:40
"Did you kill anybody" 

00:59:40
Things NOT to say to a veteran 

00:59:40
"Did you take your Meds?" 

00:59:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, but the worst things unlike he said, right, so what's the worst things to say to a veteran did you kill anybody, and did you take your meds today? And thank you. 

00:59:55
KRISTI KANEL So, that's important to know. 

00:59:55
On screen Text 

00:59:55
Things NOT to say to a veteran 

00:59:55
"Thank you for your service" 

00:59:55
UNKNOWN Those are the three things that really create on my nerves are like -- 

01:00:00
KRISTI KANEL Well, I'm hoping that the audience that's listening to us right now is going to take heed to that. Don't say thank you. Did you take your meds and did you kill anybody. This is important information for not only therapists, but for other people in life to not to do that. What would be the best things that you could hear from people? 

01:00:20
UNKNOWN You suggested something last through one session. 

01:00:20
KRISTI KANEL What, what I suggest? 

01:00:20
UNKNOWN Instead of thank you, you just said, welcome home. That really caught me. Because -- 

01:00:30
KRISTI KANEL You liked that? 

01:00:30
On screen Text 

01:00:30
Better to say, "Welcome Home", "You're off watch" 

01:00:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, because, like I said, when you're over there, the only thing you want to do is come home. And welcome home means, yeah, we understand you been through hell in back. We don't want to hear the details what just welcome home you're home safe, you're off watch. You're not standing guard anymore. And for a while, people got real patriotic and we got the welcome home, some units got welcome homes and my four deployments, I got it pack off, went to my perks and unpacked, thinking that welcome home, because it wasn't rains week or I don't play in the media, because we're using media now to help. But, yeah, just a, hey, welcome home. Because I want commercial that has that veteran coming off the bus, and he -- the world is spinning around him, that's what it's like to us. The world is spinning around and that moment I walks up to him shakes his hands and say welcome home brother, that's the foundation that we really need when we come back. And even it's funny thing, I see an eagle globe and anchor on someone always like I say semper fi and I will get in 20 minute conversation just to a complete stranger kids and wife, oh, God, dad found another marine to talk to. 

01:02:00
Reinforcing coping idea 

01:02:00
KRISTI KANEL Well, that's a -- that sounds like a good coping strategy for you -- 

01:02:05
UNKNOWN And they told -- 

01:02:05
KRISTI KANEL To talk to other marines. 

01:02:05
UNKNOWN They tolerate it, we don't even have to talk to other marines like, my son's godfather did four deployments and purple heart and there will be like two months apart from enrolls and we'd hold each other up yes, hang out and we don't even say that we just look each other, yeah. And we feel better about that. It's just -- we don't really have to talk our feelings out. We don't have to talk like oh, I'm having a rough time sleeping. It was just have that look. 

01:02:40
KRISTI KANEL So, do you think being around as marines veterans is helpful for you? 

01:02:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:02:45
KRISTI KANEL Is there something you can do on a regular basis to get, to be around other marines? 

01:02:55
UNKNOWN I tried like the Marine Corps League but it's a bunch of older gentlemen. 

01:03:00
Offers alternative coping 

01:03:00
KRISTI KANEL Have you checked into the Vet Center? 

01:03:05
UNKNOWN I have been looking into that. Sorry to say, this, but the marines are kind of a rare breed. We only like to talk to the marines. 

01:03:15
KRISTI KANEL You don't like to maybe be around -- 

01:03:15
UNKNOWN Other branches of people, you know what they did their countries -- they served the country great, and they did their jobs really well, but. 

01:03:25
KRISTI KANEL There might be some marines at the Vet center. 

01:03:25
UNKNOWN Marines stick with marines, it's just -- that's -- 

01:03:30
KRISTI KANEL Is there somewhere else you can go to be around marines that are younger, you know in Iraq and yet maybe a little younger? 

01:03:40
UNKNOWN There was a couple of programs like on base and pent up -- like the nearest ones would be bouncing, but the wounded warier -- 

01:03:45
KRISTI KANEL What about in the community -- oh, wounded warier, okay 

01:03:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, wounded warier, they're -- yeah every program has its negatives and positives. 

01:03:55
KRISTI KANEL I still think you should check the Vets Center and see if they have marines -- marine group there or something, then -- because there would be maybe people you could relate to a little bit more. 

01:04:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. I'm -- I plan on it, just life is actually -- 

01:04:10
KRISTI KANEL I think that will be nice for you. 

01:04:10
UNKNOWN High school senior and everything, but yeah. 

01:04:15
KRISTI KANEL I think that would be nice for you. 

01:04:15
UNKNOWN I really do want to check that out. 

01:04:15
Securing commitment and follow-up 

01:04:15
KRISTI KANEL Yeah. So, what's one more thing you're going to do to follow up to make sure you keep your treatment going and you continue on the good work that you're doing. 

01:04:35
UNKNOWN Try to stay away from that lonely island. 

01:04:35
KRISTI KANEL Okay. So, how are you going to do that? 

01:04:45
UNKNOWN I haven't figure that one not yet. 

01:04:45
KRISTI KANEL I think you need to go and be around other marines. You need to talk. That would be a way out of that lonely island with people that you're not comfortable with. 

01:04:55
UNKNOWN That's also kind of a test dose for one thing, you don't want to show weakness. 

01:05:00
KRISTI KANEL Oh, you think it's weak to develop yourself as a whole person? 

01:05:05
UNKNOWN Show emotions, yeah. 

01:05:05
Reframe 

01:05:05
KRISTI KANEL But that's a part of you. It's a part of being a human being. I don't know if that, that makes you weak and makes you strong, because you're a whole person that way. But it takes strength to be in touch with yourself. Something to think about. 

01:05:25
UNKNOWN Like I said that, the pressure, the sadness and the remorse and those are easier feelings that get to versus the shining and sunshine stuff that -- 

01:05:35
KRISTI KANEL But you need to be sunshine. 

01:05:40
UNKNOWN But I'm just saying it's easier to get to those feelings then. 

01:05:45
KRISTI KANEL Well, you've maybe still need to get to some of those, kind of sure like you to consider talking with some other people, because you said you don't want to be in that lonely spot to -- and maybe you could just be someplace else other than with marines like there could be another social situation you could be in. 

01:06:05
UNKNOWN But that's -- that's a part of it, the social, I don't like crowd. 

01:06:10
KRISTI KANEL Well, maybe this one or two people. That was -- 

01:06:15
UNKNOWN I'm not -- be counteract everything 

01:06:15
KRISTI KANEL I know, but I want you to think about that, okay. That would be something I think could be helpful, because you don't want to go to that lonely spot or that alone spot. 

01:06:25
UNKNOWN  Yeah. 

01:06:30
KRISTI KANEL So, I would really want you to develop a plan for yourself to work on that. And then I'm going to check up on you, and see what you did. So we are going to -- we're going to set up a time limit again. Okay? 

01:06:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:06:40
KRISTI KANEL We'll do that. And now, what we're going to do is meet with my colleague Tiffany, and we're going to kind of deep brief and talk about this session. 

01:06:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:06:50
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Thank you, Tai. 

01:06:50
UNKNOWN  Yeah. 

01:06:55
KRISTI KANEL Thank you, Tiffany for coming in. This is Tiffany Atalla Hernandez. She is a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and specializes in trauma response and crisis counseling. And we're going to deep brief, she has been watching this session and making some notes and I want her to find out a little bit about how other people were perceiving this video. First of all with you Tai, what do you feel after this video. 

01:07:20
UNKNOWN Awkward. 

01:07:20
KRISTI KANEL Awkward. What's awkward for you? 

01:07:25
UNKNOWN Sharing. 

01:07:25
KRISTI KANEL Sharing? 

01:07:25
UNKNOWN Sharing, wonder what everyone is thinking in the room and just kind of like wanting to just jump up and just go to my car. I'm blunt and truthful. 

01:07:40
KRISTI KANEL Would you like to hear what somebody was thinking of you? 

01:07:40
UNKNOWN I don't know. 

01:07:45
KRISTI KANEL How about if Tiffany were to share that. 

01:07:45
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ That's what I was thinking along that I wanted to share with you, how amazing it was, you're so vulnerable and real. Very likable. Thank you. Thanks for letting me be a part of it and everybody else too. 

01:08:00
KRISTI KANEL So that's what she was thinking. How does that -- what do you think if that's what somebody thinks about you. 

01:08:05
UNKNOWN  Scripted. 

01:08:10
KRISTI KANEL So, you don't believe it? 

01:08:10
UNKNOWN Partial. 

01:08:10
KRISTI KANEL It's hard to really trust? 

01:08:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:08:15
KRISTI KANEL That people are real and how they feel. 

01:08:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:08:20
KRISTI KANEL Was there anything said during this session that you found at all helpful or useful or what did you like the most I guess is what I want to ask. 

01:08:30
UNKNOWN Knowing that this will help my brothers, sisters down the road, that's why I keep telling myself be open, don't be reclusive and quiet and just you do for the better. I'm trying to follow the Marine Corp models simplify, always faithful. 

01:08:50
KRISTI KANEL To your fellow brothers and sisters. 

01:08:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:08:55
KRISTI KANEL Was there anything in particular said, or that you said that is meaningful to you at this point, in particular. 

01:09:05
UNKNOWN I think the three don'ts. The three don'ts that don't say to a veteran. That's like if I could take away one thing and highlight it, just like I said, say welcome home, don't ask did they kill anybody, just assume that they have, you know, it's military, combat happens. 

01:09:30
KRISTI KANEL What did you think off that, Tiffany as you were listening to that. 

01:09:35
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ I thought that was very helpful. I hadn't been told that before. And I think you're right. It is out of respect or out of an assumption that -- that's what needs to be said, thanking someone for their service. And to know that, that could bring you to another place. I like hearing the welcome home, it sounded more grounding. 

01:09:50
UNKNOWN Because it's just like that thank you for your service is like, okay, you said that you're patriotic, that's great. And it's just -- I didn't serve for sorry to be rude or blunt, but I didn't serve for you, I didn't serve for the American flag or mom and apple pie in the American way. I served to have a brotherhood, I served and survived for the guy next to me. The guy that has I drink beers with, I have shared stories with and I've cried with. It has nothing to do with my service to this country because, initially, yeah, you go and you swear it all, but don't thank me for something I didn't do. 

01:10:40
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ So meaning behind it's really important. 

01:10:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:10:45
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ Hearing that from you. 

01:10:45
KRISTI KANEL As you observed this session, what were some of the highlights or things you particularly noted as you watched. 

01:10:50
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ Well, I noticed that it -- that you're carrying sometimes two different emotions about one situation. And there is this dichotomy that continues. And so as the ABC Model evolved in your session really exploring deeper the meaning behind different things and the struggle to change your perception of things. Because I did hear you working hard sometimes took find a positive spin or a reframe on your own situation, and there were times you were very accepting of Dr. Kanel's reframes as well. So, I noticed that. 

01:11:25
KRISTI KANEL Do you have one in particular that you've -- that you noted. 

01:11:30
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ Well, I noted all that -- initially I noted your discussion of -- with the meaning behind being a monster. Okay. And what that meant for you. And then, later on, I went into looking for a greater understanding and meaning behind protecting others. In particular, when you talked about your hyper vigilance or your hyper awareness. 

01:11:55
UNKNOWN The hyper alertness. 

01:12:00
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ Hyper alertness, that was the right word. 

01:12:00
UNKNOWN Head on a swivel. 

01:12:00
KRISTI KANEL I thought that was a great reframe. 

01:12:05
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ I too do. 

01:12:05
KRISTI KANEL A very positive frame that people should be appreciative to have you around, because that's something that you are good at. And that's one of the skills for military service that is a beneficial skill. And one of the things I wished I would have said thinking upon it now that there may be some other skills you learned in the military that aren't needed anymore that might not be working for you so well, like having the hold in your feelings. Having to always buck-up and be strong, maybe that particular skill is not as useful now as being hyper alert is that would be something I wish I would have said to you before, and I am glad now I had a chance to do that. Thank you. 

01:12:40
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ Definitely interesting. 

01:12:45
KRISTI KANEL Anything else you would like to mention before we end this today. 

01:12:50
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ Well, I would like to talk a little bit about coping. Because I know that you've explored your coping already. You're doing a great job attending therapy and working with that med management as much as it can be a barrier sometimes. And you both discussed the idea of sitting down possibly with some other marines at some point. I think that there are some other areas to tap into for the future. And I just want to make sure that you are aware of them, and you continue to research them and off-hand I'll mention to you, if you haven't already looked into maybe doing some AMDR, with specifically to help with PTSD. I see the eye look -- and I understand, because -- 

01:13:25
UNKNOWN This has happened and must be cover on me. 

01:13:25
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ Well let me -- it's a long one too, it's an eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. And it can be very, very helpful with PTSD. It really helps take that trauma that still feels like it's real time, and help you reprocess it and change your perception on how you're feeling about different things that you can go on with your life and reintegrate that. It's like -- 

01:13:50
KRISTI KANEL Let's hope you can find a therapist, who could do ADMR. 

01:13:50
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ Yes. You'll be on the path -- 

01:13:55
KRISTI KANEL That will be something that really, because it's very helpful. 

01:13:55
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ Absolutely. 

01:13:55
KRISTI KANEL And it's not like that computer virtual thing at all. It's completely different. It would be more like what you and I have kind of already done. 

01:14:05
UNKNOWN That's -- 

01:14:05
KRISTI KANEL Similar to more to that. 

01:14:05
UNKNOWN  Yeah. 

01:14:10
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:14:10
UNKNOWN We are not doing that again. 

01:14:10
KRISTI KANEL Yeah. No. You won't be doing that again. Would you like to say anything else before we end this today? 

01:14:20
UNKNOWN One thing I learned for self soothing is my marine buddy told me, he's like, I want you to play guitar, that would help me. So I started playing about five years ago. Now I have 12 guitars, and I play every day for my kids. And I started to research on guitarist rivets and it's actually a movement out there of getting vets just to start on guitar. 

01:14:50
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ Awesome. 

01:14:50
UNKNOWN So 

01:14:50
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ It's so great. 

01:14:50
UNKNOWN That's my self soothing. 

01:14:50
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ That's a great soothing. Great. 

01:14:50
KRISTI KANEL Great. That's great. I really want to thank you so much Tai for coming and doing this. I know this was challenging and difficult. And I'm so appreciative of you coming and doing this and I'm just glad that you're here playing guitar and being a good dad and doing your architect stuff. 

01:15:10
UNKNOWN That's right. 

01:15:10
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ Thank you, Tai. 

01:15:10
KRISTI KANEL Thank you so much.
