USES OF METAPHORS AND POETRY IN COUNSELING presented by SAMUEL T. GLADDING, Ph.D Department of Counseling Human services and Foundations UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAMU4B 

00:00:20
FAYE LILES The reality sits in a Green-Cushioned Chair. In the midst of a day that has brought only grey skies, hard rain, and two cups of lukewarm coffee, You come to me with Disney World wishes Waiting for me to change into: a Houdini figure with Daniel Boone's style Prince Charming's grace and Abe Lincoln's wisdom Who with magic words, a wand, frontier spirit, a white horse and perhaps a smile Can cure all troubles in a flash. But reality sits in a green-cushioned chair lightning has struck a nearby tree, Yesterday ended another month, I'm uncomfortable sometimes in silence, And unlike fantasy figures I can't always be what you see in your mind. 

00:01:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Counseling is both an art and a science. It is an applied branch of the helping profession with many theories and techniques, all approaches to counseling may be diverse. There are many common threats within the profession that helped to tie it together, for example counselors make use of empathy and active listening in order to understand their clients better and help them problem set and problem solved. Another unifying aspect of counseling is the employment of metaphor within the counseling process. A metaphor is an implied comparison, in which two seemingly dissimilar objects are identified with each other. Metaphors operate on both a verbal and nonverbal level. For example, on a verbal level a person may say I’m a dot I stay in one spot. Well, on a nonverbal level a person may act clam during the midst of crisis and thus serve as an anchor for those who’re around him or her. Almost all theories of counseling from psychoanalysis to behaviorism make use of metaphors in explaining their theories and in helping their clients. Extensive research has been conducted on the use of metaphor and counseling and the overall conclusions seem to be that, 

00:02:55
1.Metaphors are a Natural Way for Both Clients and Counselors to Convey Information 2. Metaphors are an Effective Tool For Helping Clients Problem Set (Make the Familiar Strange) and Problem Solve (Make the Strange Familiar) 3. Metaphors Are Useful in Helping Clients Gain Insight Into Themselves and Change Their Way Of Functioning 4. Metaphors are Used by Clients and Counselors More Frequently When Therapeutic Progress Is Being Made 

00:02:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Metaphors are a natural way for both clients and counselors to convey information. Metaphors are an effective tool for helping clients problem set (make the familiar strange) and problem solve (make the strange familiar). Metaphors are useful in helping clients gain insight into themselves and change their way of functioning Metaphors are used by clients and counselors more frequently when therapeutic progress is being made. Poetry is rich in metaphors but has been underutilized by counselors. In this video effective ways of employing metaphors through the use of poetry will be examined. You will have opportunities at select times during the video to turn it off and to practice the skills that you have just seen demonstrated. 

00:04:00
POETRY AND METAPHORS AN INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING USING SIMPLE METAPHORS TO P ROBLEM SET 

00:04:05
FAYE LILES With Cautious Understanding She strung her words out skillfully like a craftsman stringing beads, Bright, round, nice-sounding phrases she linked together before me Capturing my dull analytical mind in the sparkle of her voice and smoothness of her tongue; One by one her feelings came not as polished as her words or as pleasing to the ear as her first free-flowing sentence, But carefully through the structured hour she heard herself a little girl crying And with cautions she carried from childhood reached out for comfort and not to charm. 

00:04:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Since metaphors are natural part of speech they may be expanded upon when they occur. In such situations clients are invited to examine what they have said more deeply and problem set in so doing clients seek more clearly how they perceive themselves and how they perceive their worlds. There are improper and proper ways of doing this watch. 

00:05:25
IMPROPER METHOD 

00:05:30
MARIANNE DREYSPRING Paul, I seem to be walking on thin ice all the time. I tiptoe around problems with my boss, my husband and my children it is a safe but painful existence 

00:05:45
PAUL MYERS Why not Marianne when the ice is thin you do need to be cautious. and though it is painful but that’s the way life is. You remind me of my other clients. 

00:06:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING In this situation the counselor acknowledge the clients predicament but basically told her that she didn’t have a problem after all, that’s just the way life is, now we’ll see a more proper way of using a client’s metaphor. 

00:06:15
PROPER METHOD 

00:06:20
JO SPRADLING I seem to be walking on thin ice all the time. I tiptoe around problems with my boss, my husband and even my children it is a safe but painful existence. 

00:06:30
JENNIFER DORRIS It seems like you don’t feel secure putting your foot down and being yourself. You’re not sure of the foundation yet walking around on your toes in such a cautious way is really not getting you anywhere I wonder what other means are available to you to help you get somewhere with your life. 

00:06:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING In this case the counselors took the metaphors walking on thin ice and tiptoe around and used them to help the client see the predicament that she was in. The counselor help the client in this case to focus on her feelings of frustration and to see where she wanted to move in line. Now while this way of using metaphors is appropriate sometimes clients and counselors can become bog down in exploring the past too much. Thus the counselors offered a slight lead at the end of this exchange. Now you will have an opportunity to problem set using a client’s metaphor. Your client is a young women, in a dual career marriage with three children and heavy civic responsibilities. She says to you 

00:07:50
JUANITA TURNER I just want to get out of this merry-go-round of madness for a while and catch my breath. 

00:07:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING How could you constructively respond to this clients merry-go-round of madness metaphor. And help her problem set. Turn off the video while you complete this exercise. 

00:08:10
EXERCISE I POETRY AND METAPHORS IN INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING PROBLEM SOLVING 

00:08:20
FAYE LILES Here and now I feel at times that I'm wasting my mind as we wade through your thoughts and emotions. With my skills I could be in a world-renowned clinic with a plush, private office a soft swivel chairs, and a sharp secretary at my command. Instead of here in a pink cinderblock room where it leaks when it rains and the noise seeps under the door like water. But in leaving, you pause at the door your voice spilling out in a whisper: "Thanks for being here when I hurt. at that moment my fantasies end as reality like a wellspring beings filling me with life-giving knowledge as it cascades through my mind that in meeting you when you’re flooded with pain I discover myself. 

00:09:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING A second way metaphors may be used in counseling is to plant seeds in clients minds of their own identity and what they can be in the future. Now this is usually, a joint counselor client adventure, as opposed to problem setting where the counselor usually follows the client’s natural language and then expands upon it. There are improper and proper ways of problem solving. Just like location is everything in business so timing is a crucial variable in problem solving. 

00:10:00
IMPROPER METHOD 

00:10:05
MARIANNE DREYSPRING I’ve told you how lost I feel at times and we’ve explored how hemmed in I’ve been you know I keep wondering if I’m not imposing limits on myself. 

00:10:20
PAUL MYERS Limits, I’d say you’re imposing limits here also everything in your life. If you want to move on, you need to learn to break some rules which one you want to break first. 

00:10:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Well, it may be true that he client is hemmed in with self-restricted rules. This way of problem solving is counselor imposed, thus the client if she gets into rule breaking may not think or feel any differently than she did before, because she has not felt in power or in control of the situation in the first place. Here is a more proper way of problem solving. 

00:11:00
PROPER METHOD 

00:11:05
JO SPRADLING I’ve told you how lost I feel at time, and we’ve explored how hemmed in I have been. I’m wondering if I keep imposing limits on myself. 

00:11:15
JENNIFER DORRIS Limits? 

00:11:15
JO SPRADLING Yes. I’m thinking that there is no way out of my situation unless I take down some of the boundaries. 

00:11:20
JENNIFER DORRIS What might be some of those boundaries? 

00:11:25
JO SPRADLING Well, I have wall of perfectionism I could take that there then there is the barrier of listening to other people instead of listening to myself that could go. 

00:11:35
JENNIFER DORRIS It sounds like part of becoming the person you want to be is that you need to tear down barriers you have structured in your mind and build more functional ways of living. Let’s look at that more thoroughly 

00:11:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING In this exchange the counselor listened first and then joined with the client to examine how she might more constructively move on with her life. Now you’ll have an opportunity to practice the technique of problem solving. Your client is the same as in the first exercise. She says to you, 

00:12:10
JUANITA TURNER I realized that the merry-go-round I have been on is one I’ve created. I’d like to get off or what is the person do without such a predicable pattern to fire back on. Do you see any other ways to ride the life. 

00:12:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Turn off the video while you respond to this client. 

00:12:30
EXERCISE II POETRY AND METAPHORS IN INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING USE OF COMPLETE POEMS 

00:12:40
FAYE LILES The band-aid man At times I entry the band-aid man who cleaned my cuts when I was young While painting me as "mercurochrome clown " before he patched my pain with adhesive. That was security to know he cared and would be around to fix, when possible, all the hurts of childhood that come in growing to be man. His job, I think, was easier than mine for in counseling I cannot always see your past wounds, scars and might-have-beens. If I could, on days like today, I might like the old man I remember try with gentleness to cover them. For you sit before me in tears and I know bow slowly it takes words to heal. 

00:13:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING The use of complete poems in counseling is another way of helping clients feel connected with others and gain insight into themselves. It must be handled carefully however. Counselors are not inspirationalist and they are not creatures. Rather they are facilitators thus poems that are used in counseling must be non-didactic and rich in metaphor and imagery. Poems by such modern writers as A R Ammons, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Langston Hughes are appropriate in counseling, however, in choosing a poem, for a client a counselor must always consider that client’s age and stage of development and keep that uppermost in mind. An interesting way of using complete poems in counseling is as prescriptions, the idea of poetry as prescription is credited to Dr. Jack Leedy, a New York psychiatrist who has often asked his clients to read a poem or poems instead of taking medication. Usually when clients come into counseling they are in mental distress and feel isolated and unique. By reading certain poems clients may realize the more universal nature of human life and not feel so alone thus they feel a sense of relief. Here are some examples a poems, the Dr. Leedy has prescribed for certain conditions 

00:15:25
for insomnia HUMN TO TH ENIGHT Henry wadsworth Longfellow A BALLAD OF DREAMDNLD Aigeron charles Sisburne TO SLEEP William wordsworth OFT, IN THE STILLY NIGHT Thomas Moore NIGHT John Whitaker TO SLEEP John Keats ANNABEL LEE Edgar Allan poe TINTEEN ABBEY William Wordsworth for anxiety ANXIETY Paul F. Whitaker I’M NOBODY! WHO ARE YOU? Emily Dickinson THE ROAD NOT TAKEN Robert Frost ODE ON A GREIAN URN John Keate THE DAY IS DONE Henry Wadsworth Longfellow SONG OF MYSELF Welt Whitman THE LAKE ISLE OF INNISFREE William Butler Keats for depression TODAY Thomas Carlyle THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS Oliver Wendell Holmes ON HIS BLINDNESS john Milton ODE TO THE WEST WIND Percy Bysshe Shelley IN NO STRANGE LAND Francis Thompson THE ETERNAL GOODNESS John Greenleaf Whittier 

00:15:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Now listen to the reading of a poem on anxiety after you finish hearing it turn off the video and note what you have experienced. 

00:16:05
FAYE LILES I feel rummagings and restless striving expectations come to my mind slowly in a rhythmic pattern of the person whose name I hold in my hand carefully typed in a medical manner The waiting room is filled with a sterile white-walled silence except for the rustle of well-worn pages of Time and Cosmopolitan that a client flips through in a nonstop style in hopes of making the hour pass quickly while discovering far-distant facts that will carry her mind and concerns from here I have opened cases so many times to find dark emotions and torn ragged feelings spelled out and spilling over onto the multilined faces of those encountered that I feel with experience nothing new will appear. But instead of a calloused mechanical style where each muscle moves in a professional manner while the voice comes forth in a well polish prose. I find my mind hearing the small fumbling sounds of your rummagings and restless striving. Thus I come ever new and never knowing to meet you and your expectations, Which you carefully carry like ancient books presenting them to me most hesitantly In the hope that like an ageless poet I will listen with grace and care to discover a beauty and perhaps new meaning in the midst of frail words which you carefully uncover and constructively sound before me. 

00:17:50
EXERCISE II 

00:17:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING The effect of poem on a person is connected to that person’s experience and perception thus the poem just read may or may not have had an impact upon you. Poems and metaphors that have impact upon people and influence them are always following the isomorphic principle that is they are paralleling that person circumstances now there are improper and proper ways to prescribe poems watch. 

00:18:30
IMPROPER METHOD 

00:18:35
PAUL MYERS Marianne I realized that you’re depressed and that you need to work on getting better outside the session. I’ll tell you what, here is a book of poetry read it between now and the next session and tell me what you think. 

00:18:50
MARIANNE DREYSPRING Poetry, Paul I’m paying you to help me. 

00:18:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Here is the more proper way to prescribe a poem. 

00:19:00
PROPER METHOD 

00:19:05
JENNIFER DORRIS Well, Jo I realized that we’re out of time and you’re still feeling depressed since I can’t be with you outside of these sessions I would like to send something with you. Some people find a great deal of comfort knowing others have felt a similar to them, often poems described these feelings. I would like to give you a few poems that other clients have found helpful. And would like for you to read these poems on a daily basis and to write down what the poet is saying is both similar and different from you. Let’s talk about this at the beginning of our next sessions. 

00:19:40
JO SPRADLING That sound good. 

00:19:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Poetry used in this manner often gives clients a sense of unity with others and generates ideas in their minds that can be return to later. Initially, many clients in their counseling thinking that their situations are hopeless and serious. Through the use of metaphor and poetry clients may come to see that their situations are serious but not hopeless or hopeless but not serious. The use of humorous poems is often quite effective in helping clients realize that their situations may be hopeless but not serious. 

00:20:35
FAYE LILES I'm nobody by Emily Dickinson I'm nobody! Who are you? Are you nobody, too? Good there's a pair of us — don't tell! They'd banish us, you know. How dreary to be somebody! How public, like a frog To tell your name the livelong day To an admiring bog 

00:20:55
POETRY AND METAPHORS IN GROUP COUNSELING USE OF WHOLE POEM 

00:21:00
FAYE LILES Encounter group beginnings all of us come from a uniqueness tempered by the fires of life strangers to each other and to ourselves at times we wait anxiously for a word to break the tension or enact to shatter silence. Knowing that most beginnings are awkward we hope for an uplifting genesis. New growth is close at hand but if not nourished it passes like an elusive second. 

00:21:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Another way a poem may be used as whole is as an ice breaker in the forming stage of group work where members are just getting to know each other or as a link in the norming(ph) stage of group work where members are beginning to appreciate each other more In either case a poem that is used in this manner serves as a catalyst breaking down barriers between members energizing them while not calling attention to itself. Johanna Lessner the California therapist is known for her work of using a poem and group work. She basically says that before a poem is used in group that other business should be taken care off and group members should be helped to relax watch this demonstration of the use of a poem in a group. 

00:22:45
RONNIE PRIEST Now that you’re relaxed, I am going to read you a part of a poem entitled Thoughts On Alice Average as I read I want you to try to identify with an image in the poem that best represents you right now. You may or may not want to close your eyes ready, There you are Alice Average seated midway back in the long-windowed class room Adjusting yourself in a polite subtle manner into the cold of a blue plastic desk that supports your body While your hand props up your drooping head That yearns to rest on the pillows of your mind. Who are you who sits so still As your last teenage year is begun Amid the crowd of faces that fill my class? Are you just a name in black type on a class roll Twice as long as my arm? Or a father's daughter, who delights in pleasing and At times perplexes an active, grey- haired man? In a world full of light words hard rock Madonnas, longhair, confusion and change Dreams fade like blue jeans And “knowing” is bound like books in quarter days That are only studied until the start of summer When you check them in and leave with what images did you connect. 

00:24:30
PAUL MYERS I saw myself as the blue plastic desk. I think a lot of people lay on it for support and I tried to give it but often not too effectively, 

00:24:40
JUANITA TURNER I’m the blue jeans with some minor responsibilities I feel I’m fading fast. 

00:24:45
JO SPRADLING For me is the name and type, people know who I am but really don’t know me. 

00:24:50
MARGARET MORRIS I feel somewhat like like you Jo I identified with the crowd of faces. I would like to stand up more but I don’t know how. 

00:25:00
POETRY AND METAPHORS IN COUNSELING PROJECTIVE POEMS AND STORIES 

00:25:05
FAYE LILES Of Frogs, Princes and Lily Pond Changes She went about kissing frogs for in her once upon time mind that's what she had learned to do. With each kiss came expectations of slimy green changing to Ajax white. With each day came realizations that fly-eating, quick-tongued, croaking creatures Don't magically turn to instant princes from the after effects of a fast-smooching, smooth-talking helping beauty. So with regret she came back from a lively lily-pond to the sobering stacks of the village library To page through the well-worn stories again and find in print what she knew in fact that even loved frogs sometimes stay frogs no matter how pretty the damsel or how high the hope may be. 

00:26:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Metaphors and poetry can also be used to help clients project into the future, this type of exercise is especially valuable when clients are very anxious about the future are a two caught up in the present to even think about the future. There are several forms that this type of exercise can take Margaret Haskins an expert in this area has suggested that one form of projecting into the future is the writing of a therapeutic fairy tale. Such fairy tales began with once upon a time and writers are given 6-10 minutes to complete this exercise. Other aspects connected with the writing of a therapeutic fairy tale include, 

00:26:55
1. set the Scene for the Tale Far Way From the Present in Time and Place 2. Include a Problem or Predicament 3. Include a Solution, no Matter How Outlandish. 4. Include a Pleasing, Positive Ending. 

00:27:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Setting the scene for the tale far way from the present in time and place, including a problem or a predicament, including a solution, no matter how outlandish, including a pleasing and positive ending. Here is a brief example of a therapeutic fairy tale, once there were three people in a mental institution when asked if they would like to get out one said, I can’t and didn’t, one said I won’t and wouldn’t. One said I will and did. Sometimes the natural metaphors the clients use can just be extended into fairy tales. Here is an example of such an extension 

00:27:55
IMPROPER METHOD 

00:28:00
PAUL MYERS Marianne you described as your life as tempered by the fire of experience that image of fire seems really strong for you, unlike for you to become that fire in your mind and tell me what you’re going to burn up in your life. 

00:28:15
MARIANNE DREYSPRING I become a fire in my mind and burned down the future. 

00:28:20
PAUL MYERS Right, just let yourself get fired up wherever you wish. 

00:28:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING In this case, the counselor started out properly but aggressed and left the client with a confusing and destructive sense of direction. Here is a more proper example. 

00:28:40
PROPER METHOD 

00:28:45
JENNIFER DORRIS Jo you’ve described as your life as being tempered by the fires of experience. You seem to be well acquainted with which fires have scared you and those that have made you stronger. Yet I feel we’ve dealt mainly with the past since you’re so into the image of fires and how those fires have influenced you, I’d like for you to write a simple fairy tale about dealing with fires. Begin the story once upon a time and set in a time and place far from here, have the character or characters deal with the problems of fires and come up with a solution that is both pleasing and positive even if it seems outlandish. You’ve only 10 minutes for this exercise so work quickly. Do you have any questions? 

00:29:35
JO SPRADLING If I can’t come up with a solution what do I do? 

00:29:35
JENNIFER DORRIS Well, we’ll deal with that if it happens. But I believe you’ll be able to come with a good positive ending without my help. 

00:29:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING In this situation the counselor was clear about the task, reassure the client and express faith in the client’s ability. Now, you’ll have an opportunity to extend a metaphor into a therapeutic fairy tale with a pleasing ending. 

00:30:05
EXERCISE IV POETRY AND METAPHORS IN FAMILY CONSELING SONGS AND CYCLES 

00:30:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Families go through many transitions after their formation. Evelyn Duvall speaks of these turning points a stages in the family life cycle, some stages such as the birth of a child or the death of a loved one are more unsettling than others. But all add up to the overall development and help of the family. Gus Napier and Carl Whitaker speak of a families reaction to different stages as the family dance, all family members dance to metaphors in their minds. Some of these metaphors are carryovers from observing one’s own family of origin while others are ideas that are formed in the mind of how the family should be. Thus it is not coincidental that certain family members will identify with poetic lyrics and songs at times. Here are few examples of songs that family members identify with a particular stages in the family life cycle. 

00:31:30
beginning family MOTHER-IN-LAW DO RIGHT WOMAN WE’VE ONLY JUST BEGUN AIR THAT I BREATH THAT’S THE WAY I’VE ALWAYS HEARD IT SHOULD BE SUMMER BREEZE WIVES AND LOVERS BROWN JUG infant family ISN’T SHE LOVELY? SWEET LIFE HAVING MY BABY BACK HOME AGAIN DANNY’S SONG BLUE HEAVEN USED TO BE HER TOWN DANG ME preschool family CAT’S IN THE CRADLE TURN AROUND BABY NEEEDS A PARENT CABIN FEVER WATCHING SCOTTIE GROW school age family RESPECT HOME IS A WOUNDED HEART DREAMS OF AN EVERY DAY HOUSEWIFE THERE’S NO LOVE IN THE ROOM WE ARE FAMILY I AM WOMAN adolescent family ONLY THE GOOD DIE YOUNG VIENNA ALL REVVED UP WITH NO PLACE TO GO PARADISE BY THE DASHBOARD LIGHT PATCHES BUCKDANCER’S DAUGHTER SCENES FROM AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT AT SEVENTEEN GIRLS JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN launching family OLD MAN I WON’T HOLD YOU BACK BABY ME BAY DON’T CRY OUT LOUD MOTHER SYNCHRONICITY II HOPELESSLY HETROSEXUAL HUSBANDS AND WIVES YOU ARE SIXTEEN GOING ON SEVENTEEN DREAM LOVER postparental family EVERYBODY HAS A DREAM HUNGRY YEARS WHISPERED WORDS BROTHER TO BROTHER COLD AS CHRISTMAS PHOGRAPHS AND MEMORIES MASQUERADE aging family ELEANOR RIGBY MY WOMAN, MY WOMAN MY WIFE PEOPLE I BELONG TO SEPTEMBER SONG SUNDAY AND SISTER JONES AND WHEN I DIE GRANDMAS’S FEATHER BED THANK YOU FOR BEING MY FRIEND WHEN I’M SIXTY-FOUR 

00:32:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Getting family members to identify what poetic lyrics is a fairly straight forward process. They’re simply asked to describe how the family functions at a particular point in time. They are improper and proper ways to do this, watch. 

00:32:50
IMPROPER METHOD 

00:32:55
PAUL MYERS I realized if you have any trouble letting go with each other, this time in your life even though Jo is 21 and needs to begin establishing a life of her own I want to suggest something for you to do to help you become more functional. Think of a song that you’ve heard describes this kind of situation of family members too close and tell me what you think. John let’s begin with you. 

00:33:15
JOHN A song that describes a close family ah.. wow this is hard. 

00:33:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING In this case the counselor was too direct and too specific. The father was fenced in by the counselor’s directions instead of being free to think. Here is a more proper example. 

00:33:40
PROPER METHOD 

00:33:45
JENNIFER DORRIS It appears me that you’re all experiencing something different in this family. You seem to realize how important it is for Joe to be out establishing a life of her own but it’s really hard to let go. I wonder if there is a poem or a musical lyric that expresses how you feel about the family right now. 

00:34:05
JO SPRADLING Oh that’s easy for me breaking up is hard to do I really love these guys and I’m afraid neither they nor I could survive very well unless are all together under one roof. 

00:34:15
MARGARET MORRIS It’s interesting to hear you say that I was just thinking of the song born free and was wondering if we as a family could undergo a rebirthing process. I don’t say your laziness (inaudible) as much as I do creating something new. 

00:34:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Now you’ll have an opportunity to think of your own experience in the family that you grew up in or the family that you created through marriage. Think of a poem or musical lyrics that describes your feeling about this family, write these words down and then discuss them with the friend or a colleague. Turn off the video while you complete this exercise. 

00:35:05
EXERCISE V USE OF POETRY AND METAPHORS IN CAREER EXPLORATION 

00:35:15
FAYE LILES Awakening In the long-shadow days of winter when the cold seeps through to the depths of your thoughts and engraves crystal frost on your morning windows You awaken your inner dreams — images that have laid dormant since summer when you — warmed by the July sun — built sandcastles and called your expectations by name Slowly with chilled fingers you handle the slow-moving memories like slightly blurred pictures basking them in the light of a 60 watt bulb from my office desk lamp that flickers off and on like the sound of your voice which seems to flow in broken waves. Yesterday the world of seas and soft rock music entertained you through the stable hours now your time is drifting high with snow and clouded moments I know that your worries wander and search for the peace of your past Yet the journey they take is filled like your steps with the still empty sounds of cracked ice on black asphalt. The month of March gusts forth with winds and chilling new directions stirring in you a sense of time and turning your mind to different sights, With your fright of unknown feelings you back through the haze of time to the thoughts that were stored in childhood Then nervously like an unsure child you glance at me for support While with a slow and hesitant movement your hand reaches out to grasp the first traces of a slightly green, almost-born season that will grow to adulthood with time 

00:37:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING The use of metaphor and poetry in career exploration is an old one. Most children recite poems and nursery rhymes about careers such as doctor, lawyer, merchant, chef(ph) and later sing such songs as I have been working on the railroad thus metaphors and poems introduced children to what certain vocations feel like give them a basic knowledge of these types of careers. John Holland an expert in the area of careers suggest that when adults are making career decisions that they get in touch with early childhood memories. Now there are some ways of doing this that are better than others look. 

00:38:05
IMPROPER METHOD 

00:38:10
MARIANNE DREYSPRING Paul I’m still confused as to what I want to do with my life. My career plans are as illusive as the wind. 

00:38:20
PAUL MYERS Mary Anne I think what you need to do is to think back to your childhood and remember your nursery rhymes now which one did you like best. 

00:38:30
MARIANNE DREYSPRING Humpty Dumpty, (inaudible ) Paul is this going to help me? 

00:38:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING The exercise that counselor imposed was done out of the blue and made no sense. Here is a more correct way of doing this. 

00:38:50
JO SPRADLING I’m still confused as to what I want to do with my life. My career plans are as illusive as the wind. 

00:38:55
JENNIFER DORRIS Joe sometimes getting in touch with early memories and the patterns that they represent is helpful in determining what you like to do in the future. I would like for you to go back in time as far as you can, and try to remember what you’ve dreamed of becoming. Sometimes a poem or a nursery rhyme will spark a memory of an early vocational choice. The important thing to remember need no stone and turn as you begin to discover yourself a new. 

00:39:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Here poems and nursery rhymes were used as an adjunct to the main task of career exploration, that is an appropriate way to use them. 

00:39:35
USE OF PEOTRY AND METAPHORS IN RESOLUTION OF THE PAST 

00:39:40
FAYE LILES Indelible, I find you there in my mind sometimes even when I am not looking subconsciously your appear breaking into my awareness just when the surface of my thoughts seemed calm. 12 years is a long time to carry a memory picture, the (inaudible ) and things become distorted, even the worlds change in the living process. Yet there we're sharing an ice cream, proud(ph) thoughts and the summer heat of Winston-Salem while carrying Carpenter (inaudible ) a good bye song from a radio in the background. Write me a line that capture summer word you say and I fumble squirreling(ph) out awkward sentences while silently praying for inspiration. Finally gazing up (inaudible ) the perspiration of my effort I share my words in a trembling voice. Summer is everything we think of today. The beauty is more than the season acceptingly you take in the thought and deliberately(ph) writing it down as your brown eyes gaze toward the horizon. Today, surrounded by the cold blue sky of December and the hectic pace of seeing clients before the Christmas holiday unexpectedly a smile momentarily summer years again.

SAMUEL T. GLADDING Memories play an important part in human life. They may either inspire or depress. In counseling it is important that we help our clients get in touch with their memories and eliminate those that depress them while getting in touch and making use of those that inspire them. This task is not always easy, but it can be accomplished through the use of poetry and metaphor. As we've seen previously poetry can help clients get in touch with the experiences that others have and thus help them feel more comfortable with themselves. Another simple way of helping clients resolve the past is to have them write down, read and then talk about certain feeling that they have had. Such a process promotes catharsis that is the release of emotions that have been bottled up and it's very therapeutic for our clients. Listen to the following poem scars and talk with a friend or a colleague about how you would use such a poem if it were brought to you in a counseling session. 

00:42:40
FAYE LILES Scars, As our sessions go well you speak of your scars and show me the places where you have been burned. Sadly, I hear your fiery stories re-living with you through your memory and words, all of the tension-filled blows and events that have beaten and shaped your life. I wish I (inaudible ) steel you say, and you were a blacksmith's hammer. Maybe then, on times anvil, we could structure together a whole new person with soft smooth sounds, inner strength and glowing warmth. Dazed your striking words catch me surprised as they scatter through my mind like stinging(ph) spots leaving me branded with lasting impressions of the dreams that born within you, through the night like furnace ovens of molding your life in such a manner that like a craftsman's flame formed product. You might live through fires and pounding to bring forth beauty and growing stature instead of painful scars. 

00:43:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Remember that when clients are getting better they often do spontaneous things such as write poems, thus it's very important that we handle this material appropriately. Turn off the video while you complete this exercise.

EXERCISE VI USE OF POETRY AND METAPHORS IN SAYING GOOD-BYE 

00:44:30
FAYE LILES Twilight, when all my clients have left the office I'll turn off the silent florescent light and watch a lingering afternoon sun like a patient court square artist, slowly spread his gold-tinged hues across my wooden floor canvas and onto my cluttered desk. That moment fills me with a sense of awe for quiet light and moving life. Walking in shadows I picture the day and wonder if life as a floatingly touched will (inaudible ) vision with beauty and wonder the small thoroughly brush strokes that they made painted in the colors and grace of time to form and transform like the sun stagnant (inaudible ) fiestas were depending on the shades(ph) display life becomes a bright warm saying or a work full of questions and mystery. 

00:45:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING A final way poems and metaphors may be used in counseling is a termination. When clients have progressed and are no longer in need of a counselor. It is important they'll be able to express their feelings about this experience. Many times clients have mixed emotion about saying good bye. One way that they can properly say good-bye to a counselor is through the use of a poem or a metaphor. Poems and metaphors express such sentiment appropriately and empower clients to thus get on with their lives. At termination a counselor can suggest that a client bring in a poem or metaphor that conveys what the experience of counseling has been like for that individual or the counselor can suggest that the client write such a poem or use such a metaphor if one is not readily available. (inaudible ) a California therapist has suggested that the emphasis in this type of exercise is on the writing or the reading and the release of emotion rather than on the poem or the metaphor as a piece of literature. Watch how such a process may be conducted.

PROPER METHOD 

00:47:15
JENNIFER DORRIS Well, Jo it looks like you've done some good work and we'll be ending our session soon. I wonder what your feeling has become near the end of this experience. 

00:47:25
JO SPARDLING Bittersweet it's been hard work, but I'll miss it and miss you. 

00:47:30
JENNIFER DORRIS I hear you and I have some of those same feelings. Since we are experienced in something similar and since both you and I write, I would like for us try to put those feeling into words and share that next time. 

00:47:45
JO SPARDLING That sounds good to me. It's like counseling. It will be hard but worth it. 

00:47:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Such a mutual ending helps clients and counselors experience both grief and relief and can be quite therapeutic. Overall the use of poetry and metaphor in counseling is a viable, exciting and dynamic way of helping. It's not for everyone however, for example clients who are concrete thinkers or those who are mentally impaired or those who are simply overwhelmed with emotion may not benefit from the use of poetry and metaphor. Yet it can make a difference and can help counselors make contact with and promote change in clients in ways that would not otherwise be possible. 

00:48:50
FAYE LILES I'm saying good-bye. So little of me were shaped by you yet those (inaudible ) of time raided(ph) me down like boulders for years and kept problems of dashed(ph) hope open. Now, free from that burden with realistic memories and strength having written myself out I'm able to say good-bye with the bittersweet realization that like an aster(ph) who shares its pain and continues to grow. Out of my experience has come not only suffering, but pearls of insight and enrich perspectives on love and life.
