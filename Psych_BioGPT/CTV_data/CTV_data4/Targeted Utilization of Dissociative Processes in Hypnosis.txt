Targeted Utilization of Dissociative Processes in Hypnosis

Brent Geary, PhD 

00:00:30
BRENT GEARY All right, welcome everyone. I assume, you can all hear me adequately even over the drone of everyone talking. Shhh… Thank you. So welcome to the clinical demonstration and Ellen has volunteered to be the subject. We're gonna do a little bit of an interview here to talk about what it is that she'd be interested in accomplishing within the hypnosis. If after 10 or 15 minutes, you become bored and you don't think that this is where you want to be, please feel free to get up and leave. Once, we start the hypnosis, nobody comes in and nobody goes out. Do you all solemnly swear? And if you take a picture, you can only do so if I can't see you do it. So if I can't see you do it, it's, it'll be okay for you to take a picture, otherwise no pictures. Uh… this is out of respect primarily for Ellen. I can divide my consciousness to a certain extent because I have two cats at home and if you have cats at home, then you get real good at dividing your consciousness. But when is doing hypnosis and one absorbing in the trance, it's nice to be able to have an atmosphere in which, you can do that without a lot of outside interference and with a number of other people in the room. So it's unavoidable but to the extent that we can, let's be respectful for her experience. All right, so would you tell me what it is that you would like to do today? 

00:02:15
ELLEN Umm… one of the things I'm working on is. 

00:02:20
BRENT GEARY Okay. I think you're gonna have to hold it, yeah. 

00:02:25
ELLEN Wonderful thanks. 

00:02:25
BRENT GEARY I don't think you're on. 

00:02:25
ELLEN Is it on? I thought it was. It says, it's on. It says, it's on. 

00:02:35
BRENT GEARY Let's try this one. If you want, you can just put it here. 

00:02:40
ELLEN Okay. 

00:02:45
BRENT GEARY Oops. 

00:02:50
ELLEN Does this work? 

00:02:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:02:55
ELLEN Okay. 

00:02:55
BRENT GEARY Okay. 

00:02:55
ELLEN So what I am interested in working on today is I umm… have a really instant critical voice that tends to respond to sort of my default first response to a lot of things. Umm… my (inaudible ) says, somebody should be doing something differently umm… they are not doing it right. Those kinds of things. 

00:03:20
BRENT GEARY When you say instant, what, what do you mean by instant? 

00:03:25
ELLEN Umm… umm… just to look at somebody and have a negative comment come to my mind about how they work or what they're wearing or, they are, they are looking at me cross eyed or anything. 

00:03:40
BRENT GEARY So this is primarily externally oriented or do you also have say things about yourself? 

00:03:45
ELLEN Well, that too. 

00:03:45
BRENT GEARY Okay. 

00:03:50
ELLEN Umm… I think, I've really worked on what I say to myself. So I don't do that as any where near as much as I used to. Umm… I haven't been that successful on getting the automatic reaction out there. It's different. 

00:04:05
BRENT GEARY How long, how long ago do you remember this starting? 

00:04:10
ELLEN Umm… probably early on but I don't have a specific. 

00:04:15
BRENT GEARY Teen years or 20s or… Even before? 

00:04:20
ELLEN I, I would say 20s probably. 

00:04:25
BRENT GEARY Okay. 

00:04:25
ELLEN That I, that I can remember. 

00:04:25
BRENT GEARY And what did you do, you say, you've, you've decreased the amount that you direct the negative thought toward yourself. 

00:04:35
ELLEN Yes. 

00:04:35
BRENT GEARY What did you do to accomplish that? 

00:04:35
ELLEN As soon as I learnt that I could change what I said to myself, the first piece I worked on was changing all the shoulds to could and so I'm, there is really very little of that that runs in my brain and I think, it used to be about 70% when I was in my 30s. Umm… so it's, it's really minimal now when I'm very aware when I start there and I go whoa, stop. 

00:05:00
BRENT GEARY So this is quite an accomplishment actually. 

00:05:00
ELLEN Yes. 

00:05:00
BRENT GEARY You could package this and become rich. 

00:05:05
ELLEN That's a great idea. 

00:05:10
BRENT GEARY Umm… have you tried to do a similar sort of thing with the externally oriented uh… talk that you do? Toward others 

00:05:15
ELLEN I haven't actually thought of doing that. 

00:05:15
BRENT GEARY Okay, until now. 

00:05:20
ELLEN Until now. 

00:05:20
BRENT GEARY Okay. 

00:05:20
ELLEN What a great idea. 

00:05:20
BRENT GEARY Okay, we're done, does anybody have any questions? This is called brief therapy. Umm… is, are there operative, because it was interesting when you talked about the, you just say to yourself that it should. Are there operative verbs that are uh… characteristic or common when you're talking about others? 

00:05:45
ELLEN I think there is a fair amount of shoulds umm… or, or feeling sort of compelled to tell them how to do it. The right way umm…, you really should, you know, sort of acting and pretty strongly. 

00:06:05
BRENT GEARY Okay. And so what have you done to attempt to minimize this? 

00:06:15
ELLEN Umm… owning up to it. Uh… at least when I catch it but it's not usually until afterwards and umm… my partner is somebody who is particularly sensitive to that in the air, even if I don't say anything about it, I'm sure I'm doing body language that goes with it. Umm… and so even if I stop myself, I've already started. 

00:06:40
BRENT GEARY And you've already given. 

00:06:40
ELLEN And, and he picks it up and it feels terrible to him and I don't want to be doing that to him. 

00:06:50
BRENT GEARY Okay. So if, if before with what you did with yourself, in your critical, with yourself, 100% at what percentage do you think it is now? 

00:07:00
ELLEN Maybe five. 

00:07:00
BRENT GEARY Gees. 

00:07:00
ELLEN And it's really down. 

00:07:05
BRENT GEARY Yeah. 

00:07:05
ELLEN And, and when the five comes up, I can go, no, no and shift gears on that. 

00:07:10
BRENT GEARY Okay. Now if we compare the amount uh, with which you used to do this against yourself with how you do it toward others, is it fairly much on a part you did about is as commonly about as, as much or do you do it more or less? 

00:07:25
ELLEN I think I, I would say that sort of first reaction is maybe 50%. 

00:07:30
BRENT GEARY Okay. 

00:07:35
ELLEN Is the, you know, it should be different or something like that. 

00:07:35
BRENT GEARY Is there anything that helps this? Anything that does decrease the frequency? 

00:07:40
ELLEN Shutting my mouth and, and saying both to myself out loud. That sounds like a great way to try it out and, and sort of open possibilities and on the inside what I have to say to myself is, it's probably gonna work out just fine and it usually does. 

00:08:00
BRENT GEARY Okay. 

00:08:00
ELLEN And even if it doesn't, it works so much better if he figures out what didn't wouldn't work and telling him what's not gonna work. 

00:08:10
BRENT GEARY So they are, they are kind of two selves so to speak that work simultaneously. The one that knows better and the one that reacts. 

00:08:15
ELLEN Yes. 

00:08:20
BRENT GEARY Okay. Umm… just like they are kind of two voices right now that you can hear. Mine and that other one. 

00:08:25
ELLEN Yes. 

00:08:30
BRENT GEARY Okay. Umm… if we were to uh, conceptually, do you think that it would work to move the voice into the foreground that "quote-unquote" knows better, that would doesn't really want to do this and move the other one more into the background because I don't, you know, I can't go and pluck it out and, and neither can you. 

00:08:55
ELLEN And I don't really want to because I don't think it's helpful to try to get rid of parts of me. But it could maybe use a different job description. 

00:09:00
BRENT GEARY Okay, okay. 

00:09:05
ELLEN Or something like that. 

00:09:05
BRENT GEARY Re, rewrite it. 

00:09:05
ELLEN Yeah. 

00:09:10
BRENT GEARY Maybe give this one a demotion. 

00:09:10
ELLEN Yes. 

00:09:10
BRENT GEARY Okay. 

00:09:10
ELLEN Yes. 

00:09:15
BRENT GEARY All right. Umm… your experience with hypnosis? 

00:09:15
ELLEN Umm… I don't have a lot of formal experience with hypnosis either doing it but I use, you know, metaphors and a lot of hypnotic kinds of things in my practice. 

00:09:30
BRENT GEARY Okay. 

00:09:30
ELLEN And I've certainly been in trance before. So… 

00:09:30
BRENT GEARY You know. 

00:09:35
ELLEN Umm… because after a bit I'm gone and then later, I come back. 

00:09:40
BRENT GEARY Uh… while you're doing clinical work or while you're watching television or? 

00:09:45
ELLEN No, I was thinking about when we've done exercises in, in presentation, go I don't go away in the middle of clinical work. 

00:09:55
BRENT GEARY Okay. Have you been to hypnosis workshops? 

00:09:55
ELLEN Yes. 

00:09:55
BRENT GEARY Okay and so you have practiced the principles and practices of hypnosis some. 

00:10:00
ELLEN Yes, yes. 

00:10:00
BRENT GEARY Okay. Umm… you like surprises? 

00:10:05
ELLEN Yeah. 

00:10:05
BRENT GEARY Pleasant surprises. 

00:10:05
ELLEN Pleasant surprises would be fine. 

00:10:10
BRENT GEARY Okay. Umm… I think what I would like to do is I have a pretty good idea to the extent that we've talked about what kind of things go on with you. Uh… this is something that you are going to address for yourself long after you and I part and hopefully what we can do here today is give you some sort of ideas, some sort of associations, how you might address this and how you might affect the shift so that the part that knows better is at the forward more often than the other one in, than the other that remains in the background a little bit more. Umm… now just exactly how that happens with you, I don't know. I'm going to do what I can do which is to provide you with a context and provide you with some associations that might be helpful. Some won't be and as you sit there kind of your task is to sort among the things that I'm telling you and saying, this might be interesting to, to follow up on, that's garbage, we'll get rid of that and put it in the trash bin or the recycle bin or whatever the case might be. Okay. So the important work that happens here is, is what's gonna happen within you and so I want you to really, really focus upon that and if you do go away and miss parts of what I'm saying that's okay. Because I have a tendency to drawing on a lot and you're probably not gonna miss my (inaudible ) away and if you come back and there is something that's interesting, you can pick right up from where it left off. 

00:11:50
ELLEN Okay. 

00:11:50
BRENT GEARY Okay. 

00:11:50
ELLEN Yeah. 

00:11:55
BRENT GEARY Umm… somewhere, so you're not looking in the light over there, somewhere over there on the wall or on, on the ceiling is there a certain spot that you can find that you would like to look at? 

00:12:05
ELLEN I think the corner of the umm… speaker. 

00:12:10
BRENT GEARY Okay. 

00:12:10
ELLEN Over there. 

00:12:10
BRENT GEARY So with your hands in a nice comfortable position like this, what I would like you to do at the beginning here and I'll be talking to you and, and giving some reminders because the, the luxury of working at a conference like this is that people have experience and I don't have to really teach you from the beginning. But I'll give you some reminders and what I would like you to do is take yourself about halfway into trance, kind of that familiar sort of feeling that you have to, halfway, 50%ish and at that point, I would like you to open your eyes and look at that spot. 

00:12:45
ELLEN Okay. 

00:12:50
BRENT GEARY Okay. But for now go ahead and close your eyes. 

00:12:50
ELLEN Okay. 

00:12:50
BRENT GEARY And take one or two or three nice easy refreshing breaths and as you do just allow the muscle energy that you're not gonna need here for the next few minutes to easily drift out of your body. You feel your feet, resting on the floor, that chair is there to support you, so you can add comfort to yourself in anyway by changing your posture, changing your position. There are different things for you to listen to and at the beginning here, you might find yourself listening to some things that you don't listen to later and it might be interesting for you and it might even surprise you a little bit to discover how that happens. Maybe you won't even be aware of it while that's happening. It might be something that comes into your awareness after it is already happened. And so as you feel that rhythm within your body, from your breathing and as you feel the muscles responding to this context and hear the sound of my voice and any words that help you with your experience. You can start to open yourself so to speak to any sorts of experiences that whatever level it might be something that you see or hear, feel remember, hallucinate that can provide you with a pleasant surprise because it's the season for surprises right now, so why not have a gift from this time and make it as important and as meaningful and as memorable for you as it can be. Now there are a lots and lots and lots of different things in your life that have been possible because of this talent and this resource and this ability that you have to focus. You accomplished certain things in school because you were able to focus, you accomplished professional things because you were able to focus. You accomplished things in relationships because you were able to focus. You accomplished things with yourself inside because you were able and so now is a time that you can utilize this capacity that you have as you let go of any need to really do anything about, anything that's happening around you. It's all, it's there, it's going on but where your focus can be is upon what's happening inside. And as you feel yourself developing that trance, developing it down to about halfway whenever that occurs, you remember that there is something for you to do. You remember that there is a change that's going to occur because you're looking forward to what it is that might happen thereafter. Almost as if, there you are, excellent. Almost as if there is something waiting for you that you know that you can use. And what I'd like to do with you is to really cement so to speak, this cooperation that you and I have that you're so splendidly developing and exhibiting, I'm going to count from ten down to one at even numbers and what I'd like you to do is to count the odd numbers. So I say ten and remind you that you can feel your hands resting on your legs and feel the warmth of your hands resting on your legs and then you say… 

00:18:15
ELLEN Nine. 

00:18:20
BRENT GEARY That's right and stay keep looking at that spot as you say those odd numbers, eight. 

00:18:30
ELLEN Seven. 

00:18:30
BRENT GEARY Excellent. And feeling more and more comfortable and even those situation might seem a little bit odd in saying those odd numbers, we're gonna come out even at the end. Six. 

00:18:45
ELLEN Five. 

00:18:50
BRENT GEARY And now halfway down in the count from ten to one and what you can feel even with your eyes open is this we finish this latter half of the countdown to one, it will be such that when you say that final odd number and close your eyes, you'll feel a complete sense of the extent of trance and focus and absorption that's appropriate for you to utilize in what you want to accomplish today. Four. 

00:19:40
ELLEN Three. 

00:19:40
BRENT GEARY Two. 

00:19:45
ELLEN One. 

00:19:45
BRENT GEARY Very good. And so just feeling yourself, allowing yourself, noticing the soothing sensations behind your eyelids, noticing any place in your body where you might want to let the last (inaudible ) of tension, just dissipate and go away. And finding the level of trance for yourself, not for me, not for anyone else just for you. That's appropriate for you to have here today. Now, it's really important to remember that there are ways in which you can change your experience. You just had one example of that, a moment ago. You're continuing to do that now and sometimes you set about on a course of action consciously and take the steps that requisite in order to attain a goal. Any of us who have been to graduate school, any of us who have been to college or university know very well about that. Sometimes we have work objectives, sometimes we have financial objectives. There are lots and lots of things that you do consciously that are extremely valuable in improving your life, providing you security and progressing in ways that you would like. But it's equally important to remember the role that the unconscious mind plays in your life and what I would like to do is to ask your permission, if it's all right that I take your right wrist and just lift that arm up in the air and have you keep it up in the air. Is that all right with you? 

00:22:20
ELLEN Mm-hmm. 

00:22:20
BRENT GEARY Okay, I'm gonna do that now. Okay, now I'm gonna take my hand away and you can keep that hand there. It's in a comfortable position, you might be a little bit surprised how long your hand can stay there without any particular discomfort. But what this right hand represents is unconscious processing at this very moment because your unconscious mind has some ideas, has some associations, has some inklings about what it is that you can do about this instant response that you have to start that critical voice. 

00:23:15
[sil.] 

00:23:20
BRENT GEARY And so as your unconscious mind processes through possibilities, that right hand will just very gradually, easily drift back down toward your leg and all the while over here, consciously, you can hear me talk about some other things. It might seem a little bit odd to you to sit in a position in which you're hearing different things and feeling different things unconsciously as well as consciously because you might think that it's your conscious mind that's allowing that arm to remain suspended but really it's the unconscious mind that does that. Because the unconscious mind is responsible for blood flow and muscle tension and all sorts of neural activities that allows that to occur. But there is a communication that occurs, a communication between parts of yourselves, these two selves so to speak these two minds and so as that arm is moving down, simultaneous with the generation of ideas and associations, images, memories, plans, thoughts, feelings, all these different that the unconscious mind provides for you. You will notice. You'll notice and you'll be aware of different things. Now they might be odd things, they might be things that don't make any particular sense at this given time, a particular image, a particular word. What does it mean to hear a cough when you're sitting here and the cough is there. They are out there, what the cough and you're hear listening to me sitting here that to me you're there hearing me talk as I'm over here but to you that's there. And they're there with the cough but you can still hear it as you can hear it here when I'm talking to you about them coughing there. And so there are all sorts of ways in which both of your minds make sense out of different things. Now probably you have more than once heard the song me and my shadow. And the shadow is something that moves with us, moves in a similar way but sometimes there is a distortion from the angle of the sun, from where the light is behind you or above you or in front of you. But the shadow is always there. Unless it's dark. And so there is an opportunity that one has to shake the shadow so to speak. When you close your eyes, you cannot see a shadow. You don't feel a shadow. But conceptually, you know it's there. You know, it's there sometime. You don't see a shadow when you're asleep and when you feel that contact with yourself, when you feel that hand come in contact with your leg, you can just allow that right arm to join the rest of your body in the level of comfort that's right, excellent that the rest of your body is feeling. And so sometimes the shadow is there, sometimes the shadow is not, sometimes the shadow is behind you and it's there but you're not even aware. So if it's there but you're not aware then maybe you can't hear what is there. Does a shadow ever talk? Does a shadow listen? It seems rather odd to think about a personification of a shadow and yet it's a part of you. It's a part of you that's a part from you. And there are a lots and lots of other things that are part of you that can become a part from you with varying degrees. And now I'm gonna ask you a question and it's a question that you can answer in whatever way is most appropriate for you. While that arm was coming down in relation to the unconscious processing that you were doing about this instant response of a critical voice, is there anything that occurred during that process that you would like to tell me, you would like to talk about here and perhaps develop in some way in hypnosis and you can say yes or you can say no. 

00:29:50
ELLEN Yes. 

00:29:55
BRENT GEARY Okay and what was it that occurred? 

00:30:00
ELLEN Umm… three images. One was umm… that shadow playing peekaboo and being really young and one was uh… the our, the, the umm… sundial at the uh… desert, botanical garden and the third one was my young self umm… trying really hard to be grown up and doing critical the way I hurt my parents doing critical. 

00:30:40
BRENT GEARY Okay. And what do you hear yourself saying anything, is that young self being critical? 

00:30:50
ELLEN No, it's more sort of a stance uh… 

00:30:55
BRENT GEARY Okay. Do you hear your parents saying anything that is critical? 

00:31:05
ELLEN No, it's, it's the pause and what didn't get said more than direct umm… but the one line is you should have done such and such. 

00:31:20
BRENT GEARY Okay. And what time does the sundial say? 

00:31:25
ELLEN 1 O' clock in the afternoon. 

00:31:30
BRENT GEARY And isn't nice that 1 O' clock is an odd number. And one represents when you you're fully absorbed into trance. And then are you playing peekaboo with the shadow or is the shadow playing peekaboo with you? 

00:32:00
ELLEN It wants for both of us to play. 

00:32:05
BRENT GEARY And what's your reaction? 

00:32:05
ELLEN I like to do that. I like to play. 

00:32:10
BRENT GEARY Okay. Of those three images, which is the one to which you would like to attend right now? 

00:32:20
[sil.] 

00:32:30
ELLEN The little one who is trying so hard to be approved of. 

00:32:40
BRENT GEARY Okay. I'd like you to focus upon that and another thing that I'd like to do is take your left arm and raise it up in the air like I did with your right arm before, would that be all right with you? 

00:32:50
ELLEN Mm-hmm. 

00:32:55
BRENT GEARY Okay, I'm gonna lift it now. We're gonna bring it up again and I'm gone take my hand away and so you keep your hand up there, okay. All right, here goes my hand separating from yours and as you run that scenario through your mind in any sort of way that you'd like, you can do it consciously, you can do it unconsciously or you can do it co-consciously. Anyway that you'd like. As that happens to your satisfaction, that left arm will do what the right arm did before and will just easily and gradually drift back down toward your leg. Now while that happens I'm going to draw on a little bit more and you can listen or you can tune out. It's important sometimes to tune out. Timothy Leary of course long time ago said, tune in, turn on but it's important that you are able to tune out. Because sometimes what's being said are really looney tunes and they can really bug you whether you're a bunny or not and so while I'm talking to you, it might become very apparent to you that what is happening in your own mind in terms of what you see, what you feel, what you remember, what you hear is infinitely more important than anything that I'm saying over here and so with that capacity and that talent that you have to focus, you can tune out anything to which you really don't want to be paying attention. Now I mentioned before that I have two cats at home and these two cats, as it turns outcome from Italy. They actually made the trip across the Atlantic ocean to come here and my male cat Luigi never ever shuts up. He's always talking, he's always mourning, he's always screaming, he's always complaining, he's always talking. 2 O' clock in the morning, 3 O' clock in the morning, 4 O' clock in the morning, even the odd hours of the day, even though my bedroom door is closed, out in the living room, out here meow, meow, meow and I want so much just to be able to tune it out and to a certain extent, I can and what I do is talk to myself and I say this is how Luigi saved his own life because when he was just a tiny, tiny little kitten, he was on the streets of Rome and he was screaming his head off and someone noticed him and said poor little thing and picked him up and saved his life. And so I taught to myself to help to understand what it is that Luigi is doing and it helps. Not necessarily all the time to tune it out but it helps with tolerance. And we all know that tolerance is an extremely important virtue. And so like that old Buddhist saying is true when you're ready to learn something, it's placed into your life. That's excellent, very good. That arm relax. If that old Buddha saying is true then certainly somebody is placed to lead you in my life. For me to learn and learn and learn about tolerance. Even if, I can't completely tune it out. 

00:38:30
[sil.] 

00:38:35
BRENT GEARY Because I want Luigi to be there. There are times when I have great friend with Luigi and it's just sweet. So it's really incumbent upon me to learn that tolerance to that voice. To learn to accept that voice and to remember the feelings that I have about him. 

00:39:15
[sil.] 

00:39:20
BRENT GEARY And separate those from the feelings that I have about the voice. 

00:39:30
[sil.] 

00:39:35
BRENT GEARY So now once again, I'm just gonna ask you a question, very similar to before, was there anything that happened when that left hand was coming down about which you would like to say anything publicly. You can say yes or you can say no. 

00:39:50
ELLEN Yes. 

00:39:55
BRENT GEARY Okay, please do. 

00:40:00
[sil.] 

00:40:10
ELLEN It was really bugging me to talk and in the midst of that umm… I got a couple of pieces uh… along with that little one learning just to act and speak critically as a way to try to be okay and acceptable. 

00:40:40
[sil.] 

00:40:45
BRENT GEARY The, that was the only way 

00:40:50
[sil.] 

00:40:55
BRENT GEARY She could try to say what she wanted. 

00:41:00
BRENT GEARY That's a pretty important piece. 

00:41:05
ELLEN Yeah. Thank you. And umm… I just felt a lot compassioned for her as opposed to something I want to get rid of. 

00:41:20
BRENT GEARY That's… 

00:41:20
ELLEN Really want to listen to her and help, help things happen for her. Help her learn to speak directly instead of indirectly. 

00:41:35
BRENT GEARY And what's the, the feeling that you have that accompanies, this, this realization? 

00:41:45
[sil.] 

00:41:50
ELLEN Umm… sadness for a lot of years that I haven't listened and umm… and just hopeful and curious about how she and I will do it differently. 

00:42:05
BRENT GEARY Okay. That's one. You remember a time that you've been hopeful and something positive has come true. 

00:42:15
ELLEN Yeah. 

00:42:15
BRENT GEARY You remember a time that you've been curious and you've had something pleasant happened. 

00:42:25
[sil.] 

00:42:30
BRENT GEARY Have you been noticing that voice in the other room here? 

00:42:30
ELLEN Not much. Just now. 

00:42:35
BRENT GEARY Tune it out, huh. 

00:42:35
ELLEN Pretty tuned out, yeah. 

00:42:40
BRENT GEARY If we go back to that sundial for a moment, there is a botanical gardens. Has anything changed? 

00:42:50
ELLEN I think it's between 4 and 5 O' clock in the afternoon right now. 

00:42:55
BRENT GEARY Okay. So there has been some change in… time has moved forward. 

00:43:05
ELLEN Yeah. 

00:43:05
BRENT GEARY Maybe other things have moved forward too. 

00:43:10
ELLEN Yes. 

00:43:10
BRENT GEARY Would that be a nice surprise for you? 

00:43:15
ELLEN Absolutely. Yeah. 

00:43:20
BRENT GEARY You know, they say ‘tis the season, there are a lot of ways to completely that. ‘tis the season to be jolly. But there is also the way that some people end up by saying, ‘tis the season to give. 

00:43:35
[sil.] 

00:43:40
BRENT GEARY And maybe you've given yourself something here today, something that can, can be valuable for you. 

00:43:50
ELLEN It feels like that. 

00:43:50
BRENT GEARY Terrific. Does it seem like there is anything else to do? 

00:44:00
ELLEN I don't think so. 

00:44:00
BRENT GEARY Would you like a moment just by yourself sitting there to cogitate, integrate what's happened? 

00:44:15
ELLEN Yes. 

00:44:15
BRENT GEARY Okay. Why don't you do that and do anything it is that you'd like to do and then when you're ready, you can either nod your head, I'll be watching you. 

00:44:25
ELLEN Okay. 

00:44:25
BRENT GEARY Or you can just say okay, something like that. 

00:44:30
ELLEN All right. 

00:44:30
BRENT GEARY Okay. 

00:44:35
[sil.] 

00:45:00
ELLEN Okay. 

00:45:00
BRENT GEARY Very good. You feel, it's okay to come back that quickly or do you want to take a little more time? You feel okay? 

00:45:10
ELLEN I think I'm okay. 

00:45:15
BRENT GEARY Okay. Terrific, that's, that's up to you. Okay, umm… people are generally curious about what has happened. Umm… things that happened inside that they can't see, I mean they could watch me but they don't know what happened with you. But I would encourage you very highly to do is to keep anything to yourself that feels like you should do that and allow this to continue to develop within you. Sometimes talking about it, spoils it a little bit. 

00:45:50
ELLEN You bet. 

00:45:50
BRENT GEARY And I don't want that to happen and if you would, if you would rather not talk about anything and, and leave right now, I can answer their questions. So what would you like to do? 

00:46:05
ELLEN I'll stay. 

00:46:05
BRENT GEARY Okay. 

00:46:05
ELLEN And I'll listen really carefully about answering or not answering? 

00:46:10
BRENT GEARY Okay. Very good. Okay, does anybody have any questions for her about her experience? Let's ask her first and then if you uh… have any questions for me, I guess we have enough time to make up something sensible for what you ask me. 

00:46:25
UNKNOWN First of all, thank you (inaudible ). Did you notice a difference in your (inaudible ). 

00:46:40
BRENT GEARY I'm sorry, is there a volunteer that can move the microphone please? 

00:46:45
[sil.] 

00:46:50
UNKNOWN That was moving, I really appreciate that. 

00:46:50
ELLEN Thank you. 

00:46:50
UNKNOWN Uh… did you notice a difference in the experience between your right and left arm on the way down and I ask because I mean, this first I've never seen bilateral arm levitation. I was gonna ask you to explain whether you think there is a neurological or neuropsyche, psychological difference but, that's why I wanted to ask you, did you, did it feel different or something about the images or anything else was different between one and the other arm? 

00:47:15
ELLEN Umm… Probably the biggest difference had not so much to do with the arm is with my level of irritation with your talking while it was going on. There was a lot with this was like, I mean, I was listening but I was like, be quiet, I'm doing stuff. 

00:47:35
BRENT GEARY Now, you know how I feel. 

00:47:40
ELLEN Well, I could be irritated (inaudible ). Umm… no, I, I do a fair amount of bilateral stuff myself and so I wasn't particularly aware. I had times where I really that I was holding my shoulder and about my shoulder drop or my arm readjust. Umm… I, but I didn't notice a big difference. It's okay. Okay. 

00:48:15
[sil.] 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN She said that you were really irritated when your left arm was going down. Umm… how does that relate to what you're trying to process, I mean, it's not a throwaway, right. 

00:48:45
ELLEN What a great question. Thank you for bringing it to my awareness. 

00:48:55
[sil.] 

00:49:00
ELLEN Umm… I think it probably is related and umm… I think I'm gonna have to just think about that some more. Or not. 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN Or not. 

00:49:15
[sil.] 

00:49:20
UNKNOWN Umm… can I ask you a question? 

00:49:25
BRENT GEARY Anybody have any other questions for Ellen? Okay. If they are (inaudible ), you can still, you can still answer them. So sure, let's… 

00:49:30
ELLEN It's just one session, thank you for all of you, I could really feel how wonderfully the space was being held. Many thanks. 

00:49:40
[sil.] 

00:49:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, I umm… I'd like to thank you. I feel, I feel very much like you. I can get very critical and I, I felt, it helped me very much because when you're like that, you feel, you will miss out if you don't have a negative thought. Something will happen bad and you will not notice. But after this work, I felt that you miss more than that also. So it was very helpful for me. 

00:50:15
ELLEN Thank you. Yeah. 

00:50:20
[sil.] 

00:50:30
UNKNOWN This is actually for both of you. From where I was sitting, in front of, it looked like, sometimes you're leaning to your right speaking in her left ear, sometimes the other direction, I don't know if I misperceived that. Was that true? Did you do that and was there a purpose to it? 

00:50:45
BRENT GEARY A couple of times. 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN And did you notice anything different in where the sound was coming from? 

00:50:50
ELLEN Yes. I did. And I, I've done some work with things that say one thing into one ear and something different into the other ear and so that felt familiar and okay and… 

00:51:05
BRENT GEARY Didn't irritate you. 

00:51:05
ELLEN Did irritate me at all. I was like, I know what this is about. 

00:51:10
UNKNOWN What's the your thinking as you're doing this? 

00:51:15
BRENT GEARY Variety. 

00:51:20
UNKNOWN Is it as simple as that or is there okay. 

00:51:20
BRENT GEARY Yeah, you know umm… both hemispheres of the brain, both conscious and unconscious minds are simultaneously processing and so it's just a little bit of a variety. It's a, you know, if I just sit here in one position and go on and on and on, so, it's, it's one thing that if there is a little bit of something that's a little bit unusual, maybe it stands out in some way, so. 

00:51:45
UNKNOWN Like you're saying, this one get in her left ear, this goes to the right hemisphere. 

00:51:50
BRENT GEARY I, I don't, no. We have a, we have a thing called the (inaudible ). And so both hemispheres listen at the same time. Did you, something you want to say? 

00:52:05
ELLEN Umm…, he didn't know this but I'm umm… brain switched so on my right side, it goes to my left brain, my left brain doesn't do logical stuff, my left brain does it's all the stuff and so he was saying unconscious over on this side and that was my right hand doing the unconscious and that worked really well. That spoke to that part of my brain. 

00:52:30
BRENT GEARY Sometimes it's better to be lucky than smart. 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN So about the bilateral, the bilateral arm levitation, is that for variety also do you have some deeper theory beyond that? 

00:52:40
BRENT GEARY No, it would be something much, much more bright than I am to see if there is any sort of neuroscience basis to it. No, it was just, we were doing two different things. So we did two different arms. 

00:52:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, I thought it was great and so the idea, you know, Erickson used to say, you talk to the unconscious here and the unconscious there. That, that had nothing to do anything you did? 

00:52:55
BRENT GEARY No. 

00:52:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:53:00
[sil.] 

00:53:05
BRENT GEARY Five minutes. 

00:53:05
ELLEN Okay. 

00:53:10
UNKNOWN You know, I'll ask my question. Okay, umm… you're counting was, you're counting using odd and even numbers and you somehow tie, you're tying the odd numbers into something important and the even numbers. Is that something you had kind of preconceived or did it evolve, it evolved as you were. 

00:53:30
BRENT GEARY It came did kind of came to me during the interview. 

00:53:35
UNKNOWN And is that something that have, that you experienced often or you, you find yourself doing often or… Okay. In terms of the numbers. 

00:53:45
BRENT GEARY Umm… this is the first time I've ever done this with the person going halfway in trance and then opening their eyes and so it's the first time I've ever, ever done it which is, I said, let's try this. How was it? 

00:54:00
ELLEN That worked. That worked well for me. Umm… probably because I don't do hypnosis. I am, I am not hypnotized on a regular basis and umm… I was interested to notice that I was very present. I was, I didn't go away during any of this. Umm… and I think that was your invitation to just go as far as that's right for me and the opening my eyes again sort of helped around of that and permission to sort of come touch back into the room and that worked fine. Your intuition was great. 

00:54:40
BRENT GEARY Good. Excellent. 

00:54:40
ELLEN Thanks for listening. 

00:54:40
UNKNOWN So that's the first time you've done that. What was it like? 

00:54:45
BRENT GEARY For me? 

00:54:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:54:45
BRENT GEARY Interesting. 

00:54:45
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:54:50
BRENT GEARY No, I thought umm…, you know, it's, it's, it's not reinventing the wheel. If people are going in a trance and they open their eyes, it's called fractionation, I mean, it's an old, old technique that's been done for years and years and years and I've done it, done fractionation in other forms but I just felt that it, it kind of encouraging me, I said let's try this. I had this theme of odd surprise to now other, other sorts of themes in mind and so I wanted her to do the odd numbers. I wanted to reinforce the odd and, and so you know, the, the old conceptualization of fractionation is that, you are some level and then when you defraction so to speak, when the person is allowed to close their eyes and they absorb more readily and umm… so it was, it was also a technique to do that. Because anybody who is sitting in front of a 100 people and, and exposing themselves in such ways to go in trance has some trepidation about that and I wanted to give her an experience where she can, she can go and she took her time which was good and then fractionate and maybe absorb a little bit more after that. So there is a little bit of method to my method. 

00:56:05
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:56:10
UNKNOWN And I'm curious too umm… I did notice several examples of fractionating and when she got to the end of this and she was lowering her left arm to her knee, I thought that perhaps your voice became, the irritant in your voice became the other part and so she got so irritated, she could let it go and that arm can go down and become one. Did you use your voice as part of the fractionating? 

00:56:40
BRENT GEARY Did I? 

00:56:45
ELLEN I don't know. I did. I did actually though umm… recognize that I was doing that critical piece inside of me in response to whatever he was doing. 

00:56:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:57:00
ELLEN Umm… and I think it was kind of like I could just note that was there without criticizing myself for it and, and sort of move steps closer to including that little one that learnt how to do that. 

00:57:15
UNKNOWN Yes. Nice. 

00:57:15
ELLEN Really early. 

00:57:20
BRENT GEARY And I did want to provoke. I, I wanted to provoke her, I, I knew that inside she would do that but I followed it up very quickly without, with things about putting in the background umm… tuning out and, and things like that. So… 

00:57:40
[sil.] 

00:57:45
BRENT GEARY Well, I always do that, so nothing knew about me going on. Okay, thank you all very much for coming.
