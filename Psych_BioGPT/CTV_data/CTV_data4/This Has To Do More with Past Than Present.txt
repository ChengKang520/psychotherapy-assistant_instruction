DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in your trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is: This has more to do with the past. Most of us look at everyday moments in life tended by experiences of the past. This is just for a time because, we can see a spelling error and or know that we prefer a science fiction movies rather than humor. So, this is helpful in making quick decisions. We don't have to deliberate over every little simple thing. Because, there is a technique which the brain uses called a heuristic. Which is the strategy to shortcut, full deliberation and reflection over everyday decisions or thoughts. However, in human relations, we can make huge errors with heuristic decision making. It can lead us to decide that the waiter in the restaurant was rude when in fact he was distracted because the chef, just snapped at him in the heat of the kitchen. If we could only listen to his inside thoughts and we would've known that the waiter was saying in his own mind. "Wow, what if I lose my job? I am working so hard already. The chef always seems to be yelling." The waiter's emotions were clouded by hurt and fear. What we felt was that the waiter was deliberately rude with us, when in fact what was going on with the waiter had absolutely nothing to do with us at all. Let's practice together. When you've experienced a difficult interaction, ask yourself. Is there a different way of looking at this? Whatever the insult, hurt or bad interaction was, what was the other person thinking? What might they be going through? And finally, let's realize that this is actually an ancient and universal system that greater minds already recognized in a time honored system. If all else fails, consider this interesting quote, Chuang Tzu. I found this quote in a wonderful book called "The Book of Awakening" by Nepo. Listen, "Being shaped by others, the whole world could praise Sung Jung-Tzu. And it wouldn't make him exert himself. The whole world could condemn him and it wouldn't make him mope. He drew a clear line between the internal and the external." Imagine what a relief that would be. So, other's bad moods, troubles, stress, anger, negativity, it can all be about them and not about all and us that all. Practice this again throughout the day, whenever you need to recapture feelings of comfort or calm. Take the time right now to form a new healthy practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky, from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
