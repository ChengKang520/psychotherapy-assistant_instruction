MARY PIPHER Thank you very much. Good morning everyone. I hope you're enjoying this conference as much as I am. It's a lot of fun. I'm honored and happy to be here with you this morning. I know a lot of you have traveled a great deal, uhm, a great deal to be here today. And, and I hope this, this lecture is, is worthy, ah, of your very precious time here in this conference. Today I'm gonna talk about the ideas in my ninth book, The Green Boat: Reviving Ourselves and our Capsized Culture. And in it, I examine our individual and cultural responses to global climate change. Uhm, I, I really struggled preparing this speech. Nobody including me wants to think about these overwhelming problems and I want everyone of you in this room to be happy and have a good experience when you listen to me. And with this topic, it's, it's a real challenge to make that happen, it's a challenge. But I'm gonna start with the most difficult material. And, ah, I'll move through it pretty quickly, and, and please stay with me for the more heartening information there will be a turning in this talk. Isak Dinesen wrote, "All sorrows can be born if put into a story." And sorrow begin with my story. In the cataclysmic summer of 2010, I experienced what environmentalist called the "Oh shit!" moment. At that time, the earth was experiencing its warmest decade, its warmest year, and the warmest April, May, and June on record. In Pakistan, ah, record high of 129 degrees. Russia record high of 111. For the first time in history, lightning fires ignited the peat bogs of Russia, and these fires spread to the wheat fields farther south. As doctors from Moscow rode to the rescue of heat and smoke victims, they fainted in their non-air-conditioned ambulances. Our planet and all living beings seemed to be gasping for breath. In July of that year, I read Bill McKibben's book Eaarth, spelled, E-A-A-R-T-H, in which he argues that the earth as we used to know it has already vanished. Any postulates that we now live on a new planet, Eaarth, spelled differently, with a rapidly changing ecology. He argues that without immediate action, our familiar ways of life will disappear, not in our grandchildren's adulthoods, but in the lifetimes of middle-aged people today. He writes, we don't have 50 years to save our environment, we have the next decade. None of my experience had could quite prepared me for the bleakness of his book. I couldn't stop reading it, and when I finished I felt shell-shocked. For a few days, all I could experience was despair. Everything felt so hopeless and so over. During that time, my grandchildren came to visit. As we picked raspberries, I thought about all the care we lavished on the children in our family. We made sure they ate healthy foods and brushed their teeth with safe toothpastes. We examine and treat every little bug bite or cat scratch. And yet, we-- and by we, I mean all the grandparents in the world, including myself-- hadn't worked to secure them a future with clean air and water and diverse, healthy ecosystems. Had we all been in a trance? That summer, when I listened to my friends talking about the mundane details of life, I wanted to shout at them, "Wake up! Wake up! Please wake up!" But after years of being a therapist and a mother, I've learned that shouting "Wake up!" doesn't work. In fact, one of my most dispiriting realizations was I desperately wanted to preserve the world I loved, but I didn't even know how to talk about this with my closest friends and family. One night, ah, during this period, my daughter and her family came to dinner for-- ah, and it was a night of a record-breaking rainfall in Lincoln where I live that we'd never had so much rain in one night before and we haven't since. After their baby went to sleep, all of us watched the wind whipping through the pines and the torrents of rain hammering our windows. Sara asked my husband and I, if we-- my husband and me, if we thought that the rain was related to global climate change. Jim and I stared at each other, almost too confused to speak. My daughter had all the dreams all mothers have for their babies. She was already doing her best. And there was a part of us that didn't wanna inflict any pain on her. But she was persistent in her curiosity. And so in the most po-- calm and positive way I could, I talk to her a little bit about McKibben's book. Well, she was devastated. She and her husband bundled up the baby and said good night. I could see her weeping as she tucked my little grandson, Coltrane, into his car seat. I wasn't sure I'd done the right thing, I felt anguished. And yet Sara's 33 years old. Could I really shield her from what scientific experts are telling us? Would I wanna be protected from the truth? Was it-- wasn't it better if we face these things together as a family and try to talk through him and figure out how we would behave as a family? Now that next week, my despair was intolerable. I couldn't enjoy anything. My conversations with my husband quickly fell into what we call, the dumper. I was afraid to be around friends for fear I would infect them with my gloominess. I had to find a way out of my state of mind. I couldn't survive all this awareness every minute of my day. I wanted to be happy again, to be able to laugh, to snuggle with my grandchildren without worrying about their futures. And yet I couldn't forget what I already knew. What pulled me out of my despair was, uhm, the desire to get to work. I didn't know what I was gonna do. I was virtually unqualified for everything involving the environment, but I realize they had to do something. It was unclear to me there was anything I could do that would benefit the world, but I knew it would help me. I've never been able to tolerate just stewing in my own anxiety. And action has always been my antidote to despair. So what I did in this particular case was I invited a group of friends to my house to discuss what we could do to stop the TransCanada Keystone XL pipeline from coming across our state Nebraska. And we're a unique state because we're a red state in the quarter between Alberta and Texas where this pipeline is to go. Uhm, and most of the red states pretty much rubberstamped all the planning for the Keystone. But our state happens to sit at the top of the largest fresh water supply in the United States of America, the Ogallala Aquifer. It provides drinking water to 40% of our population in this country. And furthermore, that Aquifer is covered by a very fragile ecosystem called the Nebraska Sandhills. And we realized in our state, if there was trouble with this pipeline, we would have no drinking water. So our state in spite of its very conservative leanings was an easy state to start talking about this pipeline because people understand in our state water and soil and agriculture and lifestyle. Those are things people understand in my state. But so anyway, we, ah, got together first little potluck in my house. We called ourselves The Coalition. Whether Randy or other's name at that time, there were three of us, but, but, uhm, we made sure all our meetings were parties. I bought a bottle of French wine. We always-- we had a lot of gourmet chefs in our group which helped a lot. We always had good food and wine. We either met at people's houses or we met at beautiful places outdoors. Not one person in that group had any extra time for tedium, for, for sitting in a dull meeting or extra suffering, but we liked being together working for a common cause. Every time we had a meeting, we planned an action. We never just sat around and talked. We always came out of our meetings with some things that we're gonna do before our next meeting. Now if you wanna discover how the world works, ah, try and change it, especially if changing involves confronting the fossil fuel industry. Our campaign has been a complicated story about money, power, international corporations, and politics. But it's also been a very simple story, about my friends and, and, uhm, me, working to save our state from what we called the Xtra Leaky Pipeline. Our campaign ended at being the best thing to happen in our state since Big Red football. Progressives and Western ranchers worked together, Sierra Club attorneys were given standing ovations in VFW's in little halls where previously if they'd showed up they might have been shot. We had tractor brigades, we had poetry readings against the pipeline. I was a member of a group of, uhm, grandmothers and we called ourselves The Apple Pie Brigade. And we would show up with The Apple Pie Brigade or apple pies freshly baked to reward legislators and government regulators who were acting on behalf of the people. And then the people that weren't, like Lee Terry, denier of climate change, one of our senators and so on. We would show up with the pie for them and a thank you in and that press conference. To thank them for changing their opinion to a more realistic one that would save our state. So we had a lot of fun with that Apple Pie Brigade. Now, what I wanna-- the reason I tell you these details are fun, they're fun to talk about, but it turns out we live in a very, very conservative state. The world radical is like the word communist in our state. And we figured out we needed to work with the, with the, uhm, symbols of our state that people loved. What is the number one symbol of Nebraska? Apple pie. So that's what we work with, the apple pie. And, uhm, it turned out to be a lot of fun. This little group of urban, urban progressives that I started with. Our first allies were the ranchers and farmers from the Sandhills. Because if I had a nickel for every time some of those ranchers said to me, "I don't agree with you on a damn thing, except this. I'd be a rich woman." But they agreed with me on this, they understood, their land and their water. Now, amazingly, ah, we've actually been pretty effective with this. In, ah, January 2012, President Obama denied a permit because of concerns about Nebraska. It's the first, uhm, permit to cross the US border for an all company that has ever been denied in this country. Ah, thank you, thank you. In 2013-- anybody in this room there? I went back to the largest climate rally in history of this country. It was a bitterly cold day, February 17th, 2013 in DC. And before I went to this rally, I went to a, a branch, ah, the NDRC and Dan Jones was there and he'd been in the environmental, ah, group that work with President Obama on this pipeline. And he turned to me, and a few of other Nebraskans, he said, "I just want you to know that this was a done, done, done deal. We were gonna sign that agreement until you Nebraskans showed up." So we got approved that we could stop it. Now, Obama is apparently going to make his final decision about that pipeline in, uhm, early winter-- I mean, early January next year and nobody knows what he will do. The outcome is uncertain. He still may decide to improve the pipeline, we can't tell. But, uhm, even if President Obama does approve the pipeline, from my point of view it's not over. And the reason it's not over is it's not over till we give up. And we're not gonna give up, we're just gonna keep going. Thank you. You know I don't tell the story to brag in the slightest bit. I tell the story to suggest to everyone of you in this room if you wanna change something in your state, have a potluck dinner with three people and go to work and you can make it happen. It's very interesting in America, we think we have no power and that belief that we are powerless makes us powerless. One of the things that just done to us was we felt like by acting as if we had power, we created power out of thin air. And it was a magnificent experience, just a magnificent experience. In fact, I, really in the book, make a mental health argument for activism because whether or not we win this pipeline we have more hope now because we were engaged in this particular process. Our coalition was not about odds. We never thought we had a chance. We did it because we couldn't let our state be destroyed without a protest. And we've had many rewards from the process. One of them has been to be involved in what Martin Luther King called, a beloved community. Durkheim I believe called it, ah, the feeling you have if you're working with other people that you love to make something good happen in a culture. He-- Durkheim called it, uhm, collective effervescence and that's what we experienced, collective effervescence from this work. I also learned that saving the world and savoring it are not polarities but tend to be deeply related. George Orwell argued that pessimism is reactionary because it makes the very idea of improving the world impossible. I found out that whether or not we believe we can change the world, even in a small way, acting as if we can is the healthiest emotional approach to take in the face of injustice and destruction. Now I'm gonna move into a little bit less, uhm, climate-oriented, activism-oriented part of this speech. Let me get a sip of water. I think the hard part of the speech is getting quite close to over. Life is very stressful in 2013. We all think something is wrong with us. But the problems are endemic and systemic. As a people, we have lost our grounding in deep time and place. Our problems are at root relationship problems. We have a disordered relationship with the web of life. Right now, the more we connect the dots between events, the more frightened we are. This reminds me of something that happened. I was camping in my own yard with my three grandchildren, Kate, Aidan, and Claire a couple of years ago. And Kate was the oldest. That time she was probably about eight, Aidan was six, Claire was four. So we get in our tent we've set up and we're listening to cicadas and the frogs from the nearly lake and, ah, we've got a great horn down in our yard. The other-- the younger two children are enjoying this enormous thing. And Kate says, "Nonna, let's just go back and sleep in the house." And stupidly, I chided her and I said, "Kate, set a good example for your younger brother and sister. You're the oldest, you should be the bravest." And she was disgusted with me and she said, "Nonna, they're still little kids. They don't know enough yet to be afraid." Perfectly right. The more we know right now, the more vulnerable we are to darkness and fear. None of us can keep up with the pace of the culture we're in. We're bombarded by too much information, too many choices, and too much complexity. Our problem solving abilities and our communication and coping skills have not evolved quickly enough to sustain us. One shorthand way to think about this, we have paleolithic arousal systems, neolithic brains, medieval institutions and 21st century technology. It's just not a mix that works. It's just not a mix that works for any of us. We find ourselves rushed, stressed, fatigued, and upset. And on all levels, international, national and personal, many situations seem too complicated to be workable. A friend I, I have put it this way, there are no simple problems anywhere. Everything is connected to everything else in such complex ways. In addition to the problems, we tend that name and label, we have new problems. We can, we can barely, barely label. Ah, writers are just now starting to coin words for some of our new, ah, phenomenological experience. For example, Glenn Albrecht from Australia coined the term solastalgia. Here's what it means. The melancholia you feel when your environment is changing all around you in ways that you view is profoundly negative. How many people in this room have experienced solastalgia? Yeah. It's a feeling without a label until Glenn. We experience our pain, but also the pain of the earth and of the people and animals suffering all over the earth. Environmentalist Joanna Macy calls this planetary anguish. We want to help, but yet we all feel like we have enough on our plates without taking on the melting polar icecaps or the dying oceans. One night when I was writing this book I had-- of course, I had to do a lot of reading about the environment to write this book. And it's pretty grim reading. At this point, all of the scientific work is especially with all the graphs going in their wrong direction and so on. So Jim, my husband invited me-- oh, and also this week, we had had a week where a tree fell and broke our air-conditioning heating unit and our dishwasher conked out on us and our refrigerator wasn't working very well, it was really old and we are thinking we might have to buy a new refrigerator. And so Jim said, "Let's sit down and have a glass of wine. And I said, I said, "I'll, I'll sit down with you if we don't have to talk about the fate of the earth." And Jim said, "I don't even wanna talk about the fate of our appliances." You know, and that's how we all feel. It's like, just our ordinary life it's too hard, "No, let's not even talk about our life," you know. The crimate-- the climate crisis is so enormous in its implications. That is just difficult for it to-- as to grasp its reality. One way to think about it is its scope exceeds our human, our neurological and our cultural resilience systems. It's too big. It's too big for humans. It's like trying to cap 2 billion pinto beans. Oftentimes because we don't know how to respond, we don't respond. And that, ah, leads us into a state psychologist call learned helplessness, psychic numbing. There's a lot of words for that beaten down state of, I really at some poor level think things are terrible and I'm not gonna do anything about it. In states of denial, Stanley Cohen writes about Germany in the denial of the holocaust. He talked about very interesting state that he called knowing-not knowing that arises from ongoing traumatic situations that are impossible to ignore but too terrible to process. So it's a kind of a knowing-not knowing. Another word for it he uses is willful ignorance, a willful ignorance. A lot of screening involved, a lot of deadening involved in willful ignorance. And I think that's the state when, when we tried to deal with global climate change for the most part. Now partly in America are cultural denial reflects a very well funded and well orchestrated misinformation campaign by the fossil fuel industry. And there's a guy-- yeah, yeah, there's a guy at, ah, Stanford named, ah, Robert Proctor who's coined-- he, he started a new branch of, of study at, at Stanford and he calls it agnotology, agnotology. And what that is is the study of ignorance that is deliberately manufactured for political purposes. And there's a lot of reason to study agnotology at this point in time. Partly though are, are cultural denial can also be explained by what Renee Lertzman calls the myth of apathy. And she did the research on this. She interviewed people about global climate change and found that people actually care intensely about this issue. But that their emotions are so tangled up and upset and they are so beset by internal conflicts and fear of speaking that they can act adaptively, they can't figure out how to do with all this care they have in their hearts. They're not apathetic, but they're in psychological shutdown. Now all cultures have rules about what can and can't be acknowledged. And I'll just give you one example from the Soviet Union. For some reason, there are tons of jokes about the Soviet Union. And I think because so many things could not be discussed, humor, just tons of ire in humor come out of that stolen hysteria. So here's the joke. Two KGB men are walking together down the street. One of them says to the other, "What do you think in this system?" "I don't know," said the other one. And he pauses few minutes and then finally says, "I probably think about the same thing you do." In which case, the first officer says, "I'm going to have to arrest you." Dr. Kari Norgaard writes, "The denial of global climate change is socially constructed. In America it's as if all relevant, ah, information about our climate change is classified. Our national policy towards the devastation all around us is, "Don't ask. Don't tell. Don't ask. Don't tell." We have a healthy and understandable desire to avoid feeling pain. We wanna savor the occasional shrimp cocktail without thinking about the ruined mangrove groves. We wanna be able to read a book about lions to our children or grandchildren without wondering how many are left in the world. And yet we cannot solve a problem we will not face. It cannot be done. James Baldwin said it in a more positive way. Not everything that it is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed that is not faced. And once we face the hard truths about our environmental collapse, once we have our "Oh shit!" moment, we can begin to transform ourselves and em-- embark on a journey that I call in the book a journey from trauma to transcendence. Despair is often a crucible for growth. When our problems are too big for us, there is only one solution which is to grow bigger, grow bi-- bigger as people, grow bigger as communities, and grow bigger as a culture. Uhm, there is a turning once things are squarely faced. And there's many, many transcendent responses. But in the book I primarily talk about three of them. One I'd been talking about which is action, and if anyone in this room is interested in acting, my suggestion to you-- people say, "What should I do? What can I do?" My suggestion to you is do what you love about what you care about the most. The world passionately needs engaged citizens at this point. Whatever your skills are, whatever your gifts are, whatever your passions are, that is where you should work. Uhm, if you can bake an apple pie, if you can create a website, if you can write a song, if you can speak to groups, if you could look at scientific research and integrate that for other people, if you can write letters to the editor, those are things you can all do right now. You know, Margaret Mead in my opinion had the best definition ever invented for a society. And that was the ideal culture has a place for every human gift. And I'm gonna paraphrase that and say the ideal transformational movement for the planet has a place for every human gift. So anywhere you can start. I like local because you know the people, you can have your friends involved, you had better connections to the resources. And because it's your place you have the most passion, you have the most love for that particular place. And if you think about it, if everyone takes good responsibility for their place, the earth can change. That's all we need to do. Take responsibility for our place. Thank you. Hopeless affection of struggle and it comes from acting as if we can make a difference. So one of the things I guarantee you is all this energy that goes into deadening and denial and avoidance. It channeled into action. It becomes something positive and hopeful, positive and hopeful. Now there's other ways to achieve transcendence. One of them is amazement. Amazement is a wonderful anecdote to despair. And in fact, my concept of balance is this, that for all of the pain of the world that you take into your heart, you must be able to have the ability to savor in equal part. So that you can stay happy and equilibrated because you're experiencing beauty and bliss and love and all the good things we want in our life, in equal part. There's a lovely, uhm, quote on this topic of, of, uhm, despair by Hanna Tennant-Moore, "It took me a long time to learn that being miserable does not alleviate the world's misery." We all have what the Lakota Sioux call Wakan Tanka, the big mysterious all around us. We can always walk outside and look at the stars. In Nebraska, I'm very fortunate if I'm having a really bad day or a bad week or if something happens it's very hard for me to process. I have a beautiful prairie I can drive to 20 minutes from my house and I can go and lie down in the dirt and look up through that tall blue stem grass at the sky and I can calm down and I can feel connected to something so much bigger than my little world of Mary, my little myself of Mary Pipher. One of my friends put that very beautifully, I was commenting one night with her how, how gorgeous the sky was and she said, "You know, Mary, I've never seen an ugly sky." Now, another thing I think that's very, very transformative is just si-- simply being present, taking a gratitude walk to the mailbox, looking deeply at your partner eyes, holding someone's hand in full presence, it's very bliss creating experience. One time I walked around this lake by my house with my friend Margie and she have this little dog that kept literally turning little summersaults and just rolling in the grass on its back and just the happiest little dog either one of us had ever seen. And Margie said, "If you wanna know what time it is, ask a dog. The dog will say, it's now, now, now." Good way to be happy. When I was walking to this meeting, I walked by a hotel room probably some children going to, to Disneyland and they were kinda squalling and laughing and I thought, "Man, I wish more adults could laugh that way." There is such a joy in the laughter of children and we can do that, we can, we can have that. It takes a little more intentionality. Now the last thing I wanna talk about is what I call moral imagination. 

00:33:50
[sil.] 

00:33:55
MARY PIPHER And I define that as the ability to understand how the world looks and feels to another person. It's all about point of view. Uhm, and it implies embedded in the term is imagination, it's an effort, you have to actually push beyond your own little filters for the world. It, it comes from love and a, and a desire to understand people because you want to love them more fully. And it's about motivation. And embedded in the idea as if you understand someone fully you will act on their behalf. And, ah, by someone, I don't only mean people. I mean, beetles and bull snakes and hawks. That someone to me. Now, I was with my-- I happen-- have any of you been with the child when they first experienced a point of view? I happen to be with my grandson Aidan. Actually, I was with that same little family of children I'd been talking about. And we went out to see the Perseid meteor shower. So we're all lined down by the plat river looking up at the Perseid's polar around August 14 that year. And, and the oldest Kate, she had seen falling stars. So I'm going, "This is gonna be so exciting. We've seen-- we're going to see falling stars tonight. It's a good year for the meteors." And Kate goes, "Well, Nonna, I've seen them. I've seen them, you know. I know it will be a pleasant experience but you're getting too excited about this." So then the little one, Claire, she really wants to see a falling star but she never looks at the sky. So we ended up seeing 20 falling stars at night. In everyone of them, Claire goes, "I didn't see it. I didn't see it." We go, "Well, Claire, you were chasing a frog. You've got to look up to see a falling star." But meanwhile, Aidan, the boy in the middle, he's lying by me in the blanket and holding my hand and he said, "Nonna, I wanna be with you when I see my first falling star and I wanna remember it the rest of my life." So that happened. Aidan is the very big hearted boy. I, I-- of course, and that's about him. But-- so that happened. He and I were holding hands when we saw our first falling star. So then we ride them back into town, they live in a little prairie town out there. They actually live on a farm but we're heading back toward their town. And, uhm, he's in his car seat in the back and I'm driving. And he says, uhm,-- we top a hill. And he says, "Nonna, look at my beautiful city." All the lights were in his little town. And I was quiet a minute and then I go, "You know, Aidan, you do live in a pretty town especially when the lights are on like this at night." And then he was quiet. And then he said, "Central city is big to me. But it's small to the rest of the world." And that's when he understood a point of view. And you know, there's adults who don't understand a point of view, but he understood it after that. He, he started to grow in his ability to understand. Now, my belief in moral imagination leads to a very simple value system. Anything that increases my own or other people's moral imagination is good. Television shows that help us love each other and understand each other, good. Anything that decreases moral imagination, from my point of view, is harmful. So for example, let's take pornography. There's a lot of things to say about pornography. But from my point of view, it's harmful because it diminishes our ability to see other people as complex human beings. We start seeing people in terms of body parts with pornography. Now, ah, the purpose of life from my point of view is to grow and develop my own imagination and help other people grow their's so that the end of life I can feel I can help other people feel that all living beings are part of their circle of caring. Mandella I think achieved that. I think Gandhi achieved it. It's a very difficult goal. But from my point of view, that is the purpose of life. And of course, everyone has their own point of view on that. And I wanna describe one more story about this point of view because these are little teaching story. But it, it shows you kind of the developmental process for this. Same children, same grandchildren. So there's a, a book and a song called, Hey Little Ant. Do any if you know that little song in book? Well, what it is is a story about a boy on a school yard. And his friends are encouraging him to step on ants for fun. And meanwhile, this ant is talking to the boy and saying, "Don't step on me, I have a wife and a family too. My life is important to me as yours is to you." So I play my little grandchildren this song. And the last chorus of the song is, "Should the ant get squished? Should the ant go free? It's up to the kid, not up to me. We'll leave that boy with the raised-up shoe. Now what do you think that boy should do?" So that's the ant. So then it's time for me to see how my grandchildren respond. So Kate and Aidan, the older two, they go, "Nonna, we would never-- we will never step on an ant again." And they probably won't. I mean, they're really good kids. We will never step on an ant. We will never hurt an animal again unless it's an accident. Well, we can't help it. But Claire is not saying anything. And so I go, "Claire, what, what would you do in that situation?" And she's quiet. I know she's gonna answer me. And finally she says, "Nonna, I can promise you this. I will never step on a talking ant." 

00:40:15
[sil.] 

00:40:20
MARY PIPHER So she's got ways to go. I actually started laughing. I tried not to laugh at my grandchildren when they're answering me sincerely, but, oh, that one just-- that was one fun. Pablo Neruda wrote, "We are each one leaf on the great human tree." And I would extend that where each one leaf on the great tree of life. Dealing with global climate change is essentially an ethics problem. If we do not expand our moral imaginations, we will destroy ourselves. Healing will involve reweaving the most primal of connections to our sacred web. Interconnection can be seen as a spiritual belief, especially in Buddhism. Thich Nhat Hanh, for example, talks about interbeing and says, "we inter-are." But it's also a scientific fact. Jeremy Rifkin writes, "We are learning that the earth functions like an invisible organism. We are the various cells of one living being. And those who work to save the earth are its antibodies." At core, interconnection is a survival strategy. Gregory Bateson said it best, "The unit of survival is the organism and his environment." Let me read that one more time, "The unit of survival is the organism and his environment." The next great rights battle will be a fight to rescue our beleaguered planet. It will be about air, plants, animals, humans, water, energy, and dirt. We have a right to a sustainable planet and a right to a future for our grandchildren. And the meadowlark has this right, and the fox, the bull snake, and the mosquito, and the cottonwood. We are in a race between human consciousness and the physics and chemistry of the earth. We can equivocate, but the earth will brook no compromises.

MARY PIPHER In our great hominid journey, no one really knows what time it is. We could be at the end, or we could be at the beginning of a great and glorious turning toward reconnection and wholeness. We who are alive today share what Martin Luther King called, the inescapable network of mutuality. We are not without resources. We have our intelligence, our humor, our compassion, we have our families and friends, and our ancestry of resilient human survivors. We can be restored. Since the beginning of human time, how many people have loved this and cared for each other in order for us to be alive today? How many fathers have hunted and fished, fought off predatators-- predators, and planted grain so that we could breathe at this moment? How many mothers have nursed babies and carried water so that we could savor our small slice of time? We could never know the significance of our individual actions, but we can act as if our actions are significant. That will only create good on earth. And besides, what is our alternative, really? So let us save and savor the world together. I wish you well on your journey. I wish you long and happy lives. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:44:35
 If you have any questions - 

00:44:35
MARY PIPHER Yeah, sure. 

00:44:35
 - ah, if you could please go to the microphone so they can be recorded also - 

00:44:40
MARY PIPHER You know... 

00:44:40
 - because I'm way too lazy to repeat questions. 

00:44:45
MARY PIPHER Can I go sit down over here for the questions? I think I can, this mic is on. 

00:44:50
[sil.] 

00:44:55
MARY PIPHER Yeah, sure. 

00:44:55
 Are you familiar with an organization called the Great Old Broads for Wilderness? 

00:45:00
MARY PIPHER That's wonderful. No, I'm not. 

00:45:05
 Ah, well, I think their focus is probably more narrow - 

00:45:10
MARY PIPHER Uh-hmm. 

00:45:10
 - than what you've been talking about and I certainly hear some shared values, uhm, similar maybe strategies and tactics. 

00:45:20
MARY PIPHER Right, right. 

00:45:25
 This is a group of... 

00:45:25
 Please speak closer. 

00:45:25
 This is a group of mature women - 

00:45:25
MARY PIPHER Uh-hmm. 

00:45:25
 - who are particularly interested in BLM lands and they make regular treks through BLM lands, uhm, and then go to BLM and let them know what they've seen and what they think the next step should be. And - 

00:45:45
MARY PIPHER Wonderful. 

00:45:45
 - I think they're based in Boulder, Colorado. And I, I, I would be very excited to see what kind of collaboration there could be between your group and the Great Old Broads. 

00:45:55
of Psychotherapy Welcome! The 7th Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference The World's Largest Psychotherapy Conference Anaheim, California • 2013 

00:45:55
MARY PIPHER Either that or you could find those women and start a group and collaborate with them. You know, I wanna tell you something. One of the things that happened with our group and, and this is-- it means no disrespect for you, but it shows the different way I think about things now. One of the things that happened with our group was people would come to us and say, "Well, I've heard that Robert Redford is an environmentalist. Have you thought about getting him involved?" Or, "I think maybe Leonard DiCaprio," or they would come with someone named like that and you know what we started saying to them, "You know what, we're talking to you. We're talking to you." Because one of the things that's crazy about America is we all sit around and wait for somebody else to do stuff. There's nobody but us who is gonna save this. And that means everyone of us. So the other thing I wanna say that your, your, ah, very good comment illustrates or makes me think of, is Paul Halkins in the '90s wrote a book in which he documented. There are over 2 million groups around the world working to save the world. In a way, what is new is not our degradation of our planet. We've been doing that since at least the industrial revolution. What's new is the number of people who are trying to stop it. And if it was 2 million in, uhm, say, '95 when Halkins wrote this book, somebody can Google it right now if they want it to be the exact date, if it was 2 million then, I bet it's 5 million now. In fact, one of the things I really think is if we had the kind of media and information delivery systems, an ideal plan it would have and we were all connected to each other and we all knew what people were doing all over the world, it would be a better world tomorrow. Because wherever I go to speak, I get so many people come up. Well we've, we've got a group doing this, we've got a group doing that. There are people in every community in this country doing things but we don't know of that. So it's a big problem. Yeah. 

00:48:10
of Psychotherapy Welcome! The 7th Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference The World's Largest Psychotherapy Conference Anaheim, California • 2013 

00:48:10
 Yeah, Mary, ah, it's interesting. I'm from Australia, and, ah, over the last, ah, six years or so with, with a, a label government which is sort of a Democratic set of party. We've had one of the most progressive environmentalist governments in the world. We put on a cabin price. Ah, sadly, we've gone to call the cabin tax. Ah, that was unfortunate. We've, ah, lead the world in many respects and in our lectures last September, ah, the principal goals of the, ah, conservative party were, ah, cut the tax, get rid of the tax and stop, ah, refugees. And we voted them in. With the 53 to 47, ah, majority which was a, ah, ah, and in the past a 100 days which we've just arrived at we have the pride-- the prideful thing of saying that we have, ah, cut out almost you, you know, dismantling all out environmental policies, all that groups, all that research programs. Ah, we actually-- when the, ah, ah, ah, the United Nations, ah, woman, I forgot her name, was talking about Manila, ah, the, ah, hurricanes that went through Manila, and she was saying this is related to climate change, our government actually came out in those statements that you can't say that and that's not true. And we're having this disturbing thing, and the point of that, and the reason not to, we're happy with my government, but just bringing the point in that this, this aspect of proximality, this expert, you know, the clear and present danger of what is most proximal to me, ah, altered the way in which our people, ah, voted. And one final thing was they have the mechanism of the press. And I don't know whether you've heard of a guy, ah, in America named Rupert Murdoch. And I guess I kinda have to say I'm sorry about that. Ah, but we had, ah, I don't know what, what it's like for you guys here with fox, it's a bit disastrous. But we actually had on the announcement election campaign a front page headline in this popular newspaper saying, "Now, kick the bombs out." 

00:50:15
MARY PIPHER Yeah. Excellent. 

00:50:20
 And so it went through. And we had-- so it's this thing, Mary, just this comment of that enormous difficulty of its so-- look at the standing ovation we got here. 

00:50:30
MARY PIPHER Yeah. 

00:50:30
 Yes. The mo-- you nearly didn't vote back in Obama. I don't know that Obama has got a lot of problems, but you nearly voted back in, ah, conservative party that would have showcased now. 

00:50:40
of Psychotherapy Welcome! The 7th Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference The World's Largest Psychotherapy Conference Anaheim, California • 2013 

00:50:40
MARY PIPHER Yeah. Let me say something about that. First of all, speaking just from myself, I have given up on the idea that politicians and the government will say this. I've totally given up on it. That is not how we will solve these problems. We will solve these problems by community, by community. People getting organized and going into the streets. Not with rocks, but with apple pies and flowers and a committed determination that it's over. Business is not gonna go on as usual. You know, you look at the history of the, the say, the Kyoto treaties, we just had another one, nothing happens there and nothing will happen there. You look at our government mired in a tired old. Here's the really interesting thing in America. We have been talking for 30 years about who believes in climate change and what percentage of the people. And do more people believe in it or do fewer people believe in it? And what states do the most people believe in it? Well that has been a total diversion from any real issue. And so one reason I wrote this book is to say, "Well, for God's sake, let's at least talk about climate change and let's at least talk about action. You know, it's very interesting for example in this country the way the debate are in climate change goes. First of all, climate change deniers get a great deal more press than people who actually believe in the climate change. But secondly, on the, on-- in the fossil fuel and the agnotology department, let's say, the agnotology department, what's happening in that kind of misinformation to the American public is at first it was nothing here is happening, don't worry about it. There's no problem here, there's no scientific evidence. Well, as the evidence has mounted and mounted, it has flipped to it's hopeless, it's over. We can do nothing about it. But you know what it missed, we are actually citizens, we are actually global citizens. And we could do something about it if we chose to do something about it. But that's a very American thing right now to either tell people there's no problem. Or if there is a problem, go, but it's far too late to fix it and you certainly aren't gonna be able to do anything about it, you know. So one of the ways to work with power is to surprise power by your tactics. So for example, I'm actually-- I went to that climate change march. It was a lot of fun. I think it fired up the believers, you know. Obama was playing golf with our people in Florida. I doubt if it made one bit of an-- you know, one bit of difference to anybody who's gonna decide on policy that 40,000 of these were out freezing, our behind is off in that march. But here's an example of how I think power really can work. In our state, what happened is we had a statewide campaign. We called it the celebration of water. It encourage every church, every library, every little town, they have an event celebrating clean pure water. It doesn't get any more basic. You know, an interesting thing in America, we have this term quality of life. Well what is quality of life involve? Health, happiness, relationships, joy, beauty, uhm, kindness, uhm, meaningful work. Why don't we just call that life? That is what life is. Ah, but we've marginalized all of the things that really mean life. And so there's enormous amount of relanguaging and there's enormous amount of fresh tactics. They're not gonna be necessary. But the good thing about that, we have seven peop-- 7 billion people on this job. Diane, you're not on-- in it alone. I'm not in it alone. Neither as anyone else in this room. We have to do our one 7 billion of a part. Maybe a little more because we live in a privileged country. But I'll tell you-- what time do we have? You have ta-- you wanna hear one final story about tactics and then-- please, you too, I think we'll have time, I'll make this kind of fast. Okay. So we had a Republican governor bought and paid for it by, ah, TransCanada. We had an attorney general bought and paid for it by TransCanada. He was letting TransCanada go in and threaten eminent domain on our ranchers whose great grandparents at home stand at their land before they receive in our permit. Our legislature had been bought and paid for it. We could have written a 1,000 letters. We could have, ah, we tried all the traditional ways. We weren't gonna change in anything. TransCanada spent over $40,000 reported money on every legislature in our statewide here. And the reported money was less than the nonreported expenses. It was all over for us if we work in that system. So we just designed all this other really funny ways to work in the system. But I actually follow this idea. I thought it was really good. We decided that we would have-- so our, our governor, it got to the-- we did not have one rule on the books, governing pipelines, not even a rule for liability or that the pipeline couldn't go by a school, or, or any rules about safety standards or clean up. The oil company will not even tell first responders what is in the Tarzan's latch. It's proprietary information. So if there's a spill, the people who have to deal with it don't even know what it is. They can have chemicals there to be ready in advance. So anyway, our governor is just rubberstamping everything. And what he needs to do is call a specialization in the legislature and introduce legislation to protect us from the spike line. Of course, he's not gonna do it. So what we decided to do is I just tell every woman I know that can get off in the middle of the day, let's start showing up at our governor's house with thank you and advanced gifts. So this is August. So we show up with the bush, with the tomatoes, we show up with our flowers from our flower garden, we show up with homemade cinnamon rolls, we throw up with little throw rugs for the governor's couch and stuff. We of course, he never comes out to me, does he has the security guard with the poker face take all those stuff. But after we give him all these if's, and we have the press there every time and the sincere woman standing up to explain why they are giving the governor these cinnamon rolls they baked this morning from their mother's recipe and such. So then after our meetings with-- after our gifts are delivered, we all march over, sometimes as many as 30 or 40 of us to governor's office and demand a-- we ask politely, we don't demand. We ask politely for a meeting with the governor. Well, the governor doesn't think we're gonna meet with this, he thinks we're environmentalist and he'd never made with this, plus he's feels totally tough lined. He has no worries about the reply test. So one day we were giving our 15th refusal. And it turns out the governor's chief aide is an old neighbor of mine. Well I never liked this ne-- ne-- neighborhood much and vice versa cuz our politics were so different. But anyways, he's name is Larry. I see him walking back to talk to the governor. I think real fast, I run over him and give him a hug. And I go, "Larry, it's been ages since I've saw you. How are the kids? How are you doing?" Well he's like, "What's going on?" He's like flummox by an issue. And then I go, "I'm here with the group of women. We've been trying to meet with the governor for weeks now. Doesn't the governor meet with his"-- and I'm talking this way, "Doesn't the governor meet with his constituents?" You know, I came just kind of naive lady just, "Why can't we meet with the governor?" And so then Larry goes, "Well, I'll look into it." And I go, "That is good because, Larry, I'm gonna come over to your house and talk to you about this if I haven't gotten an appointment for us." Well, what do you think the guy does? He makes an appointment for us. He doesn't want me showing up in his house with his wife and kids to talk this over the next night. So in some ways, you could say I was using brutal tactics there, but it worked. So we all go in. We all go in and talked to the governor the next day. And, and the governor tries as usual bamboozled and as usual, you know, kind of talking points to explain his position. Well we have been researching the stuff for two years. And what it did-- would-- he would say something and we'd go, well, that's not exactly through governor, the match here referring to our maps that are actually not US geological survey maps and they'd found-- been found by the state department to be on wood. So we could correct every little thing like that. Well, the governor, we gave him an apple pie, he waxed finely on his, his mother's apple pies. And then when we left, we said, "Now, Governor, if you call a specialization, we will back and be here with the press and give you another apple pie. And on the other hand, if you do not call a specialization, we are going to bake apple pies for every legislature and policy person in this government who's doing the right things. And we're gonna call a party on the lawn of the capitol for the people who are taking care of our state." Well, you know what? He called a specialization. We don't know if it was us. That's not my point. And I'm certainly not claiming credit for that. But I'm saying that is the kind of tactic that every single person in this room can pull off and at least something we did has made to you to difference. And if Obama approves this pipeline, it's not over. One thing we've done, we have built a solar barn. We had a barn with this with a lot of press. We've got a video about this that's gone national. We built a solar bomb-- barn right in the proposed pipeline root with farmers and potlucks and every-- all this children hammering away on the barn and that barn will be our place of resistance. And if that pipeline comes near our state, we are all going together around that barn and sing and have potlucks and talk to the press and hand out homemade cookies. And then if necessary, we are just gonna lie there in front of the equipment. So we're strategizing how, how to keep this thing going. Another question-- and this would probably be-- the you two and then we'll stop. 

01:02:05
 Dr. Pipher, I very much respect your courage and your commitment. Uhm, I have nothing to lose. I own no property. I don't have a car. I do not work for the government. I do not work for no other companies. I'm very much a respecter-- and this is what I want to ask with you, respect my courage in front of this audience, I'm very much a respecter of Bjorn Lomborg, the skeptical environmentalist. 

01:02:30
MARY PIPHER Uh-hmm. 

01:02:35
 I respect his research, I respect his views. They are not the same as yours. How do you react to someone like me prepared to stand up in a hostile audience to say what I said? 

01:02:45

01:02:50
MARY PIPHER Well I'm not upset about that in the least. I mean, I'd never for one minute think everybody in the room agrees with me, nor would I expect them to nor would I want them to. I think I actually don't know the person you're talking about. That probably also helps me be not the slightest bit upset. It's much easier to be upset if it's somebody I've personally tangled with and find their views in aftermath. That being said, I think there is enough common ground that we don't need to worry very much about divergent views. How many people in the world wanna drink clean water? How many people in the world wanted the Amazon tropical forest to survive? How many people in the world want soil that is arable? I think there's enough common ground that I always work in the common ground. I ha-- you know, my attitude, ah, by the way, and this is not about you, I don't know this person's belief, but one of the things our group found out very early on, is we never argue with the climate change deniers. Because it's a waste of time. As one my friends said, you cannot reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into. And what it does is to waste time arguing with people who will not respond to reason. What that does is dispirit you and waste time. And it can also start family fights at thanksgiving, and who wants that? You know, there's no point to do that. There's two groups of people that it really makes sense to talk to about these issues. One is people who already are with you who can help you organize to deal with things in your community. And the other is people who are amenable to reason and encouragement. So that's how we spend all our time with. Thank you for coming up. I'm sure it did take courage. Please.

 I don't know it's answer to this question or not, but I keep wondering as a psychologist what happened to the moral imagination of the Murdochs and the CEOs of fossil fuel companies and all. I feel somehow in effect could understand that. I'd no better how to fight it. 

01:05:15
MARY PIPHER You know, I think that it's a great idea. The time is up. Anybody who wants to go, go, but just to respond briefly to that, I was very impressed when Thich Nhat Hanh was asked what he would say if he could talk to Osama bin Laden after 9/11. And he said a very interesting thing. He said, "I would like to sit down with him and I would like to ask him his point of view. And I would like him to tell me the experiences he has had that led him to the set of conclusions he has about the world. And once I listen to that very respectfully and very carefully, I would proceed to change his mind." And that's what I think I would do too. If I had a chance to talk to the CEO of TransCanada, I would very respectfully sit down and talk to him. And first I would listen to him. Thanks all of you for coming.
