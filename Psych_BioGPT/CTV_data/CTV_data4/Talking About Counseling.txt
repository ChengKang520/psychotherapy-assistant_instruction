00:00:35
MIKE SIMMONS Hello my name is Mike Simmons and I teach counseling at the University of Wales, Newport. One of the features of our counseling courses here is that once a year we take our students away for a residential weekend. This can be a pretty intense business and after the days work is done the staff tend to sit around together chatting as they unwind. Inevitably, a lot of that chatting is about counseling and one such residential weekend has struck me that lot of what was being said people talking about the years of experience at the counseling core phase could have been a real interest to the student, who by then were relaxing in the bar. I began to wonder whether there was a video in all this. To that end I invited four counselors into the studio presented them with the range of topics and asked them to talk about them. Afterwards, I edited the tape, cut out all the indiscretions and irrelevances and wound(ph) up with what you have here. The counselors in question were for the most part hugely experienced with very many thousands of counseling hours under their collective belts. There was Helen Burston who originally trained in the mid 80’s and who has experience of counseling in agencies, of training volunteer counselors and students and of working as a primary care counselor. She has also had a lot of experience in counseling young people. But she now runs her own busy private practice from home where most of her clients are adults. Then there was Norma James who is a counseling lecturer here at the university and who originally started her training in the early 90’s. Norma has worked in agencies in the past and has had a small private practice. But she now works exclusively as a counselor in a hospital in South Wales working with clients experiencing loss and grief. Then there was Jan Gray who also works here as a lecturer as well as maintaining an active private practice. Jan originally trained in the mid 80’s and like the others has also worked in agencies in the past and she still does some work for the NHS. And finally there was Sarah Rogers who isn’t an experienced counselor at all. But a student just working towards the end of her diploma here at the university. That requires her to complete a minimum of 100 counseling hours with an agency and she has now just completed those. I invited her because I thought she introduce a further perspective to the session. Someone who is looking forward to her counseling career rather than back and someone who might ask some useful questions of a more experienced colleagues. So that’s who I invited and that’s why I invited them. Hopefully this is an all to self-indulgence just a bunch of my colleagues having a chat in the studio and drinking coffee at the universities expense. What I hope is that this video will give you an insight into the world of counseling as it is in Britain in the early part of the 21st century. Let’s see. 

00:04:10
SARAH ROGERS Okay so what is like being a counselor? 

00:04:15
HELEN BURSTON Huh… it's quite interesting, I mean it’s hard to say it is enjoyable because it’s not really enjoyable to… to sit with people in a great deal of distress. But I find it fascinating, I’m fascinated by how people are and how people react. So I think for me that was it’s… that's what it’s like. It’s a fascinating occupation. 

00:04:50
JAN GRAY Yeah and I suppose I think for me one of the things it's lonely. It’s quite a lonely, solitary job. But I think I’ve learnt more about me since I become a counselor after I've been qualified. So it has helped to place me in… in… in the world. 

00:05:10
NORMA JAMES Yeah but… but possibly(ph) with the… with the lonely. I think when I’m working as a counselor I’m alone. Ah… but because I’m within the organization then there are always people there you know and but yeah in… in the hour I’m alone. And… and that sometimes feels like quite a responsibility. But the hour finishes and then we walk back down to the reception area and… and the world is buzzing again. So I guess that… that is slightly different to you when… when you’re working at home well for two of you I guess. 

00:05:50
HELEN BURSTON Yes I mean it… it is… it is… it is true it’s lonely, but it's also the… the process of counseling involves something very intimate, happening between two people. And I would kind of put you in touch with all the different bits of you I think. On the other… perspective, I think lonely, there is something about I think working in private practice can be lonely. Because you haven’t got the thing of walking outside of the consulting room and having a chat with somebody else or just sort of offloading how you might feel in that moment, which can be very holding and supportive. 

00:06:40
JAN GRAY But I think there is also something about how possibly before I was a counselor. My relationships with friendships probably were different how we… on the whole(ph). So it… it's changed how I… how I use friendships that’s right word. So you know perhaps lonely is, lonely more about how is affecting me outside the job to some extent. 

00:07:10
HELEN BURSTON But I think that, I think that's true, I think ones relationships do change. 

00:07:15
NORMA JAMES Because you… you begin and then you intimate to that you… you begin to relate on a much of our different level on a deeper level with people. And that's what we train to do you know that becomes part of us. 

00:07:30
Yeah. 

00:07:35
NORMA JAMES I mean it’s… it’s hard sometimes to switch… to switch from that deeper relating. And this one you know, I can understand why… why people get stand affability(ph) because you don’t want to be precious but they recognize that you changed. 

00:07:55
HELEN BURSTON Yes, but I think for me the opposite has happened in a way that I think before or whilst I was training or before I started training when I was quite interested in the whole field a bit. I think I was kind of turning all my friends into clients. And all sort of couldn’t think of anything else, I was so absorbed with it all, that all my conversations were psychological and I wasn’t really interested in anything else. And I find as time is gone on, I’m very clear that when I’m with my friends I don’t want that kind of conversation. And people ask me why do I tend to trying avoid answering the question because I feel a barrier goes up, especially with strangers. 

00:08:45
JAN GRAY You can be clear be that is in your mind, but I think it’s sometimes hard for your friends to be clear. And so yes there is a barrier goes up both ways as I think I’m aware that lot of people get quite scared of me for the job title. I almost feel assigned(ph), but you know I’m still me, you know I’m off duty now. 

00:09:00
HELEN BURSTON Yeah. 

00:09:05
SARAH ROGERS So they are worried(ph) today you’re going to analyze them in someway in that whilst they are not noticing. 

00:09:10
HELEN BURSTON Yeah although you can see into their mind somehow. 

00:09:15
NORMA JAMES You know this is all done very jokingly, but don’t you do that counseling stuff with me now really. You know and… and sometimes yes you do lapse into, but sometimes it is such a part of you. It's a part of how you communicate with people. It’s hard to realize that you’re doing it. You know, and then it’s oh… oh crump's(ph) yes okay let’s talk about News tenders or the yachters(ph) or. 

00:09:45
JAN GRAY But you'll not find as an expectation of news well that you’re supposed to be deserted(ph) to get the person, you never can pitch, you can never come on, you could never you know some… 

00:09:55
HELEN BURSTON …pass judgment on anybody. 

00:10:00
NORMA JAMES Yeah, I sometimes think if clients knew that we were also in therapy they might go oh! Oh!. 

00:10:05
SARAH ROGERS Yeah I’m wondering whether people whether you experience that people saw, your friends saw you out as well at the beginning you know, they knew you’re a counselor or therapist or whatever and then they maybe talk to you about stuff that they might not have done before because of the perceived change in role. 

00:10:25
HELEN BURSTON But that’s a two-way thing isn’t it and there is something about you’ll talk people to you if you’re kind of really hone in on peoples problems. 

00:10:40
NORMA JAMES Oh! it is part of instruction of… of you know your… your course practice outside… at who can you practice on… your best buddies or you know your… 

00:10:50
HELEN BURSTON But it's a dangerous thing isn’t it? 

00:10:50
NORMA JAMES Oh yes. 

00:10:50
HELEN BURSTON I mean I remember when I was first training and picking up something from somebody else while talking to at a party. And kind of coming in with something and then absolutely their eyes filling up and the… you know sort of a very wobbly moment. And a kind of thinking oh my god we’ve got to be really careful, a little bit of, a little bit of scallop information or it can be quite a dangerous thing. 

00:11:20
JAN GRAY I suppose as a division between learning it a skill that you… you recognize that using the skill and been able to specify that this is as good I'm using at this particular time and… and separate it from this is me the person, this is how I relate. And I suppose the person get you in to do the training initially and then you learn there is a skill and it is a tool and yes it is involved a new role(ph), but, but it can be… it can be used. 

00:11:45
 Yeah. 

00:11:50
JAN GRAY …quite specifically in home… 

00:11:50
HELEN BURSTON Yes in an intentional way. 

00:11:55
SARAH ROGERS To see if we can pick it up and put it down. 

00:11:55
JAN GRAY Well hopefully I mean that’s hopefully. 

00:11:55
HELEN BURSTON Yeah but when you are first training you can’t do that can you? It’s… it’s… 

00:12:05
NORMA JAMES …continually trying to fine tune and… and then sometimes you know you get blur entirely wrong. But you know that times you can hardly hit what you’re doing. You know but balance does come, somehow it comes, sometimes it… it just. I think sometimes, it’s almost unnoticed. Yeah, it is almost noticed and yeah it comes together. 

00:12:30
JAN GRAY Yeah, I think it’s finally I think I probably lost my sense of humor for about a year, first year of training because everything really intense. And we always sort of the ire(ph) in you and… and I couldn’t, couldn’t joke or laugh because… and I think when it came back again appropriate it was okay and good. I could be in that way you know be as silly as I was before and… 

00:12:55
HELEN BURSTON Quite a relief. 

00:13:00
JAN GRAY You know it is tough being serious as all the time. 

00:13:05
NORMA JAMES It may be that… that’s of expectation of people half of counselors like that… that I don’t know that we should be serious you know that we should to have a gravitas(ph) if you like you know. 

00:13:15
JAN GRAY You know my son told everybody I have to wear dangly earrings he just say… But I guess that something about, you know about the image isn’t it of… of counselor because it has an image… 

00:13:35
HELEN BURSTON And well the way that counselors are portrayed on the media it infuriates me. 

00:13:40
SARAH ROGERS So what your views on you know the requirements otherwise for personal therapy because that’s been mooted(ph) down hasn't it now of accreditation. 

00:13:50
JAN GRAY I mean, I think quite strongly that I cannot, I cannot understand why anybody would feel that they could be a therapist or a counselor and not have undergone the experience to know what is like to be client themselves. And actually I… I think that's quite arrogant to think that I… I can help you and I’m not prepared to be where you are. 

00:14:15
HELEN BURSTON Or I haven’t been myself to the depths that I’m expecting you to go to. I agree with you entirely I think it’s a real shame. I mean I can’t just sort of understand and I… I think personal therapy is the only way to have personal development. And I think that's where BACP coming from on that one. But… but I think I myself I’ve learnt so much more about being a therapist by being a client than I have from anything else. 

00:14:45
JAN GRAY I know… I know because I'm CBT background and… and there sort of hasn’t been that much emphasis and focus on the therapeutic relationship. Things have changed, things are changing and that is becoming incorporated into CBT training now that they are realizing that is you know the relationship and what it feels like in that relationship is this integral to the therapy as any tool or technique that you give. So you know that you know… you can, you can only experience that by doing, by being that. But then the downside I’ve… I’ve had clients who are students who have to have the requisite number of sessions in order to fulfill the course criteria. And they have skimmed along the top. 

00:15:30
SARAH ROGERS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:15:35
JAN GRAY Because you know they’ve… they’ve not really being prepared to… to do it and… and take… 

00:15:40
HELEN BURSTON They’re doing it to fulfill the criteria rather than because they want to do it for themselves. 

00:15:45
SARAH ROGERS And how do you deal with that and with the vassals(ph) of clients. I guess it is more just students as who come in but don’t really want to do the work. 

00:15:55
JAN GRAY Here is a tough one, I mean the analogy I use it was that it is like a elective surgery I suppose to. You know so… so they come in and choosing and I suppose put like that it’s… it’s how radical they want that surgery to be. 

00:16:10
SARAH ROGERS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:10
JAN GRAY I have to be only so frantic or frustrating at times. And I’m thinking of a couple that… that we felt like we played and we wasted time and we talked about the process, but not actually gone that's never gone live as it were. 

00:16:30
HELEN BURSTON Did you feel like that yourself when you… when you’re in therapy. 

00:16:30
JAN GRAY No, no. 

00:16:35
HELEN BURSTON Well I think I did, I think I, it took me about a year before I… I actually felt like a client and not an observer of the process. And yeah and that must have been very frustrating for my poor therapist. 

00:16:50
JAN GRAY So perhaps that say in 10 sessions, is that… is 10 is not enough it needs to be you know if you’re going to do it, you need to do it for a longer period. 

00:17:00
HELEN BURSTON Well that would be my opinion but then I mainly work long term with people and I really believe in that, but I’ve done a lot short term work in the past. And… and I think it’s a whole different ballgame really. 

00:17:15
NORMA JAMES From that idea that you learn from your own therapy, you know what might be going on for your client. I certainly learned a lot about resistance to counseling and… and to whom a therapist. You know I’ve been better able I think to work with my clients because of that. 

00:17:35
SARAH ROGERS So like your personal therapies given you a better understanding of how to deal with resistance in your own client. 

00:17:40
NORMA JAMES Yes, I mean I’ve always I think when… when clients don’t want to be there then that’s what you’ve got to work with. But I think it’s given me a deeper internal understanding of what might be going on for that. You know and the risk you know they… they… they sent and you've got a risk stuff. 

00:18:05
HELEN BURSTON So it’s a kind of awareness of the obstacles the things they getting aware of somebody actually looking openly and truthfully at themselves. And the kind of ways we probably use ourselves and see in our clients of changing the subject, diverting attention. 

00:18:20
NORMA JAMES Yes… oh yes… oh yes. 

00:18:25
HELEN BURSTON Looking on to something more possible. 

00:18:30
NORMA JAMES Yeah don’t check. 

00:18:30
SARAH ROGERS And one of the other questions I guess this as a sort of beginning counselor ah… that almost everybody on my course want to now induce(ph) how do I get into the work. And you know how does it move from… how did it move for you… for you from being on a course and training and maybe doing placement work into actually doing it for real. 

00:18:50
NORMA JAMES What doing it for real in an agency or independently? 

00:18:55
SARAH ROGERS Yeah, yes well both I suppose. I’m not certain how many people just go from being on a course to working privately on their own. 

00:19:05
NORMA JAMES These days that… that is heavily discouraged I think. 

00:19:10
JAN GRAY Oh there are lot of courses only train and students to work in an agency settings now. So some of the courses they wouldn’t have had the training to be on their own and… 

00:19:20
SARAH ROGERS Right, so the students will just go straight into… 

00:19:20
JAN GRAY …into an agency, they will be trained to work in an agency setting. But it is a really good question actually because when I know when I qualified and became accredited and then I thought well actually now I can do it on my own and it was, I… I could remember that sitting one day think about what… what’s stopping me, you know who do I need permission from. It felt like I needed something it just say you can’t do this on your own now. So yes there was a clearly defined day when somebody phone me up and I said yes, secure. And then I have to fix a price of course for that because that was then going to become my profession and then how do I… how do I know how much I’m worth because I’m to that point. I had been doing it for nothing. 

00:20:10
SARAH ROGERS Right. 

00:20:10
JAN GRAY So it… so it… it did changed within a week. 

00:20:15
SARAH ROGERS Wow, so went from being the end of the course to… into private work pretty more straightly. 

00:20:20
JAN GRAY Well, it went from being an agency counselor… 

00:20:25
SARAH ROGERS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:20:25
JAN GRAY …and to being on my own and having to think about things like insurance, premises, you know having to employ a supervisor, yes, I mean it was… there was a day when that happened. And actually that day, I mean that it cost me more to see that client by the time I paid for everything than the client was paying for me. 

00:20:50
SARAH ROGERS And how did you choose how to much to charge the client? 

00:20:50
JAN GRAY That was… that was tough. 

00:20:50
HELEN BURSTON And this… I think is where support from peers comes in… 

00:20:55
JAN GRAY Yes. 

00:20:55
HELEN BURSTON …doesn’t it? 

00:20:55
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:20:55
HELEN BURSTON I think its… its very hard to do that all at on your own. 

00:21:00
JAN GRAY Yes. 

00:21:00
HELEN BURSTON …you know finding out what your peers are charging and how they go about it and… and… networking really. 

00:21:10
JAN GRAY Hmm…hmm… 

00:21:10
HELEN BURSTON I mean I think the… the people who get most clients are the ones with a lot of fingers and a lot of pies. 

00:21:15
JAN GRAY Yes. 

00:21:15
HELEN BURSTON Become very known. 

00:21:15
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:21:20
HELEN BURSTON I mean I think it is still word of mouth that bring us client along more than anything else, but umm… certainly things like the ACPE website and yellow pages and that kind of thing, has made a big difference. 

00:21:30
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah, I mean certainly most of my referrals come from umm… the BABCP’s website. 

00:21:40
SARAH ROGERS Right. 

00:21:40
NORMA JAMES Which is what… 

00:21:40
JAN GRAY That’s the British Association for Behavioral Cognitive Psychotherapies. And so, they would just give you the accredited cognitive therapy, so thought cognitive therapy is sort of the best therapy at the moment, there are very few accredited therapists, so… so that’s how I get my referrals. 

00:22:00
HELEN BURSTON I’ve done a lot of work in GP surgery, so I get quite a number of referrals from doctors… 

00:22:05
JAN GRAY Hmm…hmm… 

00:22:05
HELEN BURSTON …ex-clients, people who pass my name on to others and not so many from my own organization because its based quite a long way away from where I live umm… but the BACP do it really I think themselves sort of main. 

00:22:25
JAN GRAY Hmm…hmm… 

00:22:25
HELEN BURSTON But then other therapists… 

00:22:25
JAN GRAY Yes. 

00:22:25
HELEN BURSTON …that’s where we’re having a network of other therapies if you are working on your own at home is I think really important part of the support structure that you need to build around you to support you in the work. You get to know when people have got spaces and what their specialisms are and so that… if somebody would interrupt and you haven’t got a space, you know that you can recommend a particular person whose work you know… 

00:22:50
JAN GRAY Hmm…Hmm… 

00:22:50
HELEN BURSTON …and… and that’s why I get referrals for us well. 

00:22:55
SARAH ROGERS What was your first job based qualification? Was that first paid counseling that you did? 

00:23:00
HELEN BURSTON I worked on the young people's counseling service as a training coordinator, I think my title was and I run training courses for the volunteers and supported the volunteers and… and did supervision and so clients from the agency as well is really good rounded bit of experience. 

00:23:20
SARAH ROGERS Hmm…hmm… 

00:23:20
HELEN BURSTON Uh… I was very lucky to get that… to get that job. 

00:23:25
NORMA JAMES I mean, I may have well apart from that a… a brief stint working at home. Uh… I’ve always worked within the… the volunteer sector as a volunteer counselor. And I think I’m likely to… to stay there, I mean I can… I can afford to do that because I have employment elsewhere. But it sort of fits in with a bit of a being my only(ph) devout accessibility of counseling, I'm not… in anyway putting down people who can afford to access independent counselor, but there are many… many people who suffer because they can’t pay for it and while I'm able I will stay a volunteer, I think. That will change… that will change and uh… and then I’ll be in that place where I have to decide that how much should I charge which is the question that you… you asked, you know. 

00:24:30
JAN GRAY Do… do you think it changes how you feel about the… the role when… when you are doing it privately I supposed doing it in a volunteer basis? 

00:24:45
NORMA JAMES I don’t know. The short while I did that it is… this goes back to what we were saying a… a moment ago I've… that is when I felt lonely. When I was just seeing a few clients at… at home, you know because… because I’m so used to the boasts(ph) of other people around me and instant support systems as well, you know I'm incredibly lucky I work within an organization that that is really… really supportive. You know it's very helpful for its placement, students and volunteers and there’s good supervision as you know we get paid expenses. We look toward issues like health and safety, good training you know staff that are really well qualified and it… it felt in… in that… in that short time, I was away from… I’ve taken a great big leap. I couldn’t open the door and there would be you know people in the offices are walking down the corridors, I felt really strange. But the aloneness about being with it was exactly the same, that intimacy one to one where the rest of the world sort of disappears and you’re entirely focused on… on another you know on another person. That was the same. 

00:26:15
HELEN BURSTON Yeah, I think it changes. When you’re starting out, you really need the support of… of umm… you know of other… of other, but this has been true for me and I think what you are saying you know, whereas you can't can’t imagine a time when you wouldn’t need that. But for me, I think I did need that and now I don’t and I don’t know that’s about. 

00:26:45
NORMA JAMES I mean how would you feel Sarah, you’re… you’re asking this to us, I wonder if its a scary prospect for you, yeah? 

00:26:50
SARAH ROGERS Terrifying. Yeah, now I can’t imagine it really, you know the thought of somebody failing me up and saying, would you guys take on this referral, I mean your private capacity would be terrifying, which is odd really because it shouldn’t be like that because you’re responsible in the same way to all of your clients that… 

00:27:10
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:27:10
SARAH ROGERS …really makes no difference whether you see them in a agency setting. But its nice to have the support of the agency umm… although it didn’t work in a building and I guess that… that… that question really is about where do you go from there? 

00:27:25
NORMA JAMES Hmm… 

00:27:25
SARAH ROGERS You know how do you sort of shift in, but it feels at the moment like that that’s probably just opportunity just arises and you take opportunities and then more opportunities come along and gets maybe… gets into what Helen was talking about the networking and becoming known and sort of like… like a river coming to a delta and broadening out there maybe. 

00:27:45
JAN GRAY Hmm… yeah and I think it can open lots and lots of doors because they… if you think about it sort of from the pragmatic level you’re training yourself look made you better communicator hopefully, so whatever you’re going to be doing, you’re going to possibly be going to be doing it more effectively. So, possibly that the counseling training may open different doors say, you know teaching, training and… and it may not be that you’re under counseling per se, but… but its opened the door into somewhere else. 

00:28:15
SARAH ROGERS Yeah. 

00:28:15
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:28:15
SARAH ROGERS Yeah, it wouldn’t have happened. And the other thing I was thinking about while you were talking was how important your first placement was, the choice of your placement. I mean I think there are some people who choose that placement because that’s why they came into counseling because they have a specific interest. 

00:28:30
HELEN BURSTON Hmm… 

00:28:35
SARAH ROGERS But for me, I didn’t and I kind of recognized for me its… I thought no I want to teach generic and then I’ve ended up actually being very involved with young people even though that's generic work and kind of feels like I’m going to be maybe that path be more, I wondered for you whether that was the… was the choice of your original placement or the work that you done before you did the counseling training significant and how it were developed. 

00:29:00
JAN GRAY To be choose our clients. 

00:29:05
HELEN BURSTON Well, years ago you didn’t have to do placements on… 

00:29:05
SARAH ROGERS Right. 

00:29:05
HELEN BURSTON …counseling courses. When I did my training, that wasn’t the case… 

00:29:10
JAN GRAY Didn’t you? 

00:29:10
HELEN BURSTON No. I found myself a placement working umm… for a voluntary organization it was a telephone helpline and… and got some experience that way, but it wasn’t a required part of the… the training. I think it's really good that it is. 

00:29:25
JAN GRAY Yeah, I… I suppose that… I think my first placement I was just glad that anybody would take me so it was… it was fairly generic. And then umm… I worked with umm… with a client group that I haven’t expected to work in it. I found it personally quite challenging, so I was working with people with disabilities and I had… had not experience of… of that in my life at all. Umm… and that was wonderful I was in… you know I really enjoyed that. But my main interest, yes I've ended up working with that, which was possibly the reason why I went into counseling the first place which was way related umm… eating disorders. And yes, I chose my client group. That was possibly more about my own history as to why I chose to work, specifically I mean my private practice is fairly generic, but… but my interest would be with that. 

00:30:20
SARAH ROGERS It's something which may have had something to do with you coming into the whole field to start off with. 

00:30:25
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah. 

00:30:25
SARAH ROGERS Yeah. 

00:30:25
JAN GRAY And I wonder if its like that for the people. 

00:30:25
HELEN BURSTON Yes I… and… I mean the… the very first placement idea I was working for umm… parent helpline. Umm… and being a parent of young children at the time myself, I think I… I… I was drawn to that and it felt very relevant. And then when I worked for the… the young people’s counseling agency all my children were teenagers at the time. So there was something about… I was getting something for me from that too umm… but my specialism became young people umm… and I would get referred a lot young people from doctors. Umm… but as time went on and… and my private practice developed umm… so I've… I… I felt that it's less appropriate for young and not possible for young people to go into… ah… to go to see into independent practitioners, they haven’t got the money. Umm… and it means that their parents have to bring them and that immediately creates a difficulty, especially if you live in a rural area like I do and there’s always that dynamic then, umm… and I think its probably more appropriate for young people to go to… to agencies. But I think its very difficult work working with young people. So I think the agency has to be really good. I don’t think it’s a… umm… this is a bit controversial and it might get cut out, but I think that umm… you know umm… working with young people is very difficult and umm… there are a lot of… a lot of people who work in young people’s agencies are not very experienced and short we’ve all got to learn somewhere, but that’s my particularly hobby always about young peoples agencies. We can carry on that way… But I like not to have a specialism really, I mean there are some people that I wouldn’t see because I’m… I’d… I haven't had enough experience and when I was working as a primary care counselor umm… there were particular areas that counselors would be referred, clients would be referred to umm… within the other psychological therapies. Umm… and so I didn’t see people with eating disorders, I didn’t see people with addictions, alcohol problems. Umm… and so, I would be reluctant to take on people in my private practice with those issues, simply because of lack of experience. 

00:32:55
NORMA JAMES Yeah and I’ve just always worked in bereavement umm… for as long as I can remember. Umm… it was my first placement started off with pregnancy loss. But then I… I think it was through most of the… I still wanted to be in bereavement, I still wanted to work in that area. And so, I… they… they were training in the hospital where I work you know and I applied for it and I… I did it and… and that’s where I've remained. And you were saying Helen, early how fascinating counseling work is umm… bereavement work still absolutely fascinates me. And we’re very lucky in the service because, although clients referred with the bereavement or they can refer in themselves we’re allowed to travel with them, you know I’ve explored that areas I… I… I know there are some bereavement services who will just stick rigidly to the… the bereavement. So, in a sense, although they come in because somebody has died as if all of their life is dead because that… that’s what they talk about. You know so its in a sense is generic as well. And… 

00:34:15
JAN GRAY Yeah, and… and I think also with the weight clinic although extensively its that toward for weight management and weight loss and its fairly generic. 

00:34:25
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:34:30
JAN GRAY I mean more rationale for being there is I'm helping the person come back to clinic in order that they get the medical treatment and if it means we talk about bereavement or anxiety… 

00:34:35
NORMA JAMES Yeah. 

00:34:40
JAN GRAY …just so happens that I’m interested in how psych… how psychological help can help somebody with umm… obesity umm… because its relatively… it wasn’t considered an emotional problem, it wasn’t considered a problem that needed any psychological support obesity umm… up until fairly recently. And I think even now its considered a medical problem and its not an emotional problem. So… so for me it’s a whole… you know it’s a whole new field, it’s a whole new way of thinking and working with clients. And for me, it's clear that there is a link. 

00:35:15
NORMA JAMES Well, like for the backside off we are just one and I think you probably know because its… its my belief that I mean I work with bereavement, but when I'm working with his loss you know and I think that permeates our human experience, so its gonna be in any sort of counseling you know whether its with young people or whatever. 

00:35:40
SARAH ROGERS I wonder if that’s a common experience that is… as a student you start off thinking I'm going to do bereavement counseling or alcohol counseling and then actually is to get more experience to just and so being the same thing, but under different type of person. I was going to ask about supervision and how you find good super… how you know you found a good supervisor umm… whether and what negative experiences you have in the supervision front? 

00:36:10
JAN GRAY Yeah, I suppose, for me, a good supervisor, a good enough supervisor is one that I feel challenged, but held while I’m being challenged. And I think a… I remember I… in training we had umm… supervision as part of the course and we… we given a supervisor in a… in a case discussion group as such. And it was a very negative experience because I didn’t have that feeling of umm… actually if I was… wasn’t… I wasn’t liked as a… as a person, I wasn’t valued of all the core conditions weren't there for me in that relationship. And I supposed to some extent, it has to mimic the… the therapeutic relationship. But then it must be too closely and it's got to be that element of child you know I like to feel that I've been given some to think about when I go away. 

00:37:05
SARAH ROGERS And if you ever started a relationship with the supervisor and thought no, this is not gonna work and stopped? 

00:37:10
JAN GRAY No… no… no, I've had… I mean I haven't had that many supervisors, I think I've had four and two of which I've chosen myself. I do wonder if you gets to a point where I… I perhaps need to think well, perhaps I need to think about do I need something different now from the supervisor do so ah… you know do we renegotiate or do I look for it elsewhere. 

00:37:40
NORMA JAMES And was that because your expertise had grown, experienced. 

00:37:45
JAN GRAY Well, on a… on a practical level we come from different theoretical models. 

00:37:50
NORMA JAMES Hmm… 

00:37:50
JAN GRAY So, umm… we're almost having to use interpreting, you know an interpreter with some of… and… and how we approach our client work, may be different and so, umm… if I'm wanting sort of education from my supervisor as to the theoretical model and… and specific technique then I'm not going to get it from that supervisor because she doesn't have that knowledge of the model in the same way and actually brings me you know a… a… a different understanding and then allows me to look at things in a very different way, but sometimes I want somebody to say to me… this is what we need to do it here and you thought to doing that. And so what I've done is I've actually found another supervisor that we have sort of pay review so its not a… it seems more to paid supervision for the super technique. 

00:38:45
NORMA JAMES So, you got the best of both worlds? 

00:38:50
JAN GRAY Yeah, I think I probably have actually. Yeah. 

00:38:50
HELEN BURSTON Yeah, umm… needs change and therefore supervisors sometimes need to change umm… or there needs to be some kind of reviewing process going on within supervision of changed needs. Umm… and I think we need different things from supervisors at different stages of our development umm… so you know the first supervisor has got an important role in supporting somebody through developing their practice and there's more of a training well for a supervisor early on that whilst the… that the further on you… you go there's more of a sense of a consultancy and colleagues and peer… peer supervision maybe anything like. But I… I think umm… that its quite important, especially early on and this isn't the way round I did it myself umm… to have a supervisor who models the approach in which you were taught, so that you've got something to… to… to kind of… because I think its asking quite a lot of inexperience counselor to be able to integrate another approach into their own. 

00:40:05
JAN GRAY Yeah, it possibly wasn't ideal from the confidence building point of view. And certainly from a… a personal support and supporting and then that good experience of the relationship that possibly from… I mean confidence to use the model umm… probably ideal. 

00:40:25
NORMA JAMES And so, I… at… at one time in my development I made a decision to…to work in a… in a different approach. And I was advised to… to pick a supervisor who worked within that approach, and… and that's what I did. And that… that was really helpful because she helped me to make that transition. I… I had got to a place where I… I needed to find out if it… if it would work with me. But I needed the supervisor who would watch that I wouldn't be I guess my fantasy was that if I change something is gonna happen to the… to the client, you know, so she help me take that transition. And I worked with her for quite a long period of time. But now I've moved to another supervisor who perhaps works with me in a more purest approach. But I think, with all the supervisors that they've had what makes it work for me is when I'm comfortable enough to take mistakes. You know that… that… that's when I know and… and I come back feeling, I feel of very tired, but I feel refreshed and you know I've… my head is buzzing with sort of you know because I've moved on, I've… I've understood, I've integrated or whatever. And I learned to do that with a supervisor long time ago when she said to me one day umm… Norma, will you stop trying to figure it before you bring stuff here. I said what, you've noticed. Because I just couldn't take her, you know material I saw, I'll be criticized for. You know and it was such a huge relief to… to be honored. 

00:42:20
HELEN BURSTON It’s okay to bring the mess… 

00:42:20
NORMA JAMES Yes… yes. Absolutely. 

00:42:25
JAN GRAY That is completely… I’ve… I’ve struggled bringing this success and my supervisors, you know insists though I tell her the good best(ph), because I’ve… I’ve tended to bring here all the… the things on… on my own struggling with. And that’s been hard to sit and say you know our folk are happy with that so that’s been useful. So perhaps I say something about my expectation of what supervision was about. 

00:42:55
NORMA JAMES Yes, yes. 

00:42:55
SARAH ROGERS And when you were saying that you sort of had to get your first supervisor or your first client… 

00:42:55
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:43:00
SARAH ROGERS …and you still crack it but sort of supervision, how did you go by finding or choosing is that supervisor that sort of first private onus… 

00:43:05
JAN GRAY I think I phoned round and asked other people. 

00:43:10
SARAH ROGERS A recommendation. 

00:43:10
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:43:15
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:43:15
NORMA JAMES Yeah. 

00:43:15
HELEN BURSTON Mine… mine have been… have all come through agencies I’ve worked for all my own training organization, people on their list. So that there have been umm… although one exception umm… when I… I… yes, I… I kind of did a bit of research because I had a very specific need. It was a time when I had two supervisors one for my kind of psychotherapy clients and one for my primary care clients and I sort out a supervisor who I knew would have the expertise and experience that I needed and help for… for the primary care clients. So… so that makes it a bit easier when you’ve got a specific need you’re looking for somebody with a particular approach or particular set of skills. 

00:44:05
NORMA JAMES Yeah that’s what I have to do for this… this last supervisors I’m working with now sort of require him middle of course that I’m on that. I work with the supervisor that’s accredited by… by that college so it’s just given a list. You know and picked the… the one that was closest to me. I think it is mostly quite often it word of mouth or recommendation. 

00:44:30
SARAH ROGERS And what is that about the relationship to you and the supervisor than that makes you think it's time to change or move on or is that always been dictated by agencies and so on? 

00:44:40
HELEN BURSTON For me there was something about I was noticing that I was through the training process really that I was working in a different kind of way and I wanted somebody to model that for me the way in which I was developing. So that was… that was what inspired my last change of supervisor. 

00:45:05
JAN GRAY I suppose for me it would be the sense that the hour and a half, the two hours I’ve been and that they haven’t come away thinking. I haven’t thought about it that way or you know that… almost like the meal that you've eaten and 10 minutes late and you’re still hungry. 

00:45:30
HELEN BURSTON It became a bit stale? 

00:45:30
JAN GRAY Yeah… a yeah bit… bit too comfortable… 

00:45:30
HELEN BURSTON Alright. 

00:45:30
JAN GRAY …a bit too… I suppose I… I… I like to have that sense that there’s somebody there right in your own way that sort of up… up there as to where I’m down there. And… and if I felt that I was too much there, then I… I would… it’s about safety I think. I’m not feeling that… that… that there’s somebody there that would know more than me. It was strange enough is that less important now which is possibly why I don’t feel the need that I would need to change the supervisor now and so that probably says more about me and how I’m going into the supervision. 

00:46:10
SARAH ROGERS Yeah because I think about supervisee there, supervisor that feels very familiar for a student… 

00:46:15
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:46:15
SARAH ROGERS …you know trainee counselor that they will… you know that’s a familiar feeling. 

00:46:20
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:46:25
SARAH ROGERS And nice comforting because you feel like you can take your mistakes and say what do I do now? 

00:46:25
JAN GRAY Yes, yeah, and what do I do? 

00:46:30
NORMA JAMES Yes because it… it is a big step from… from college learning to agency that first time you're working with… with a… with a client and I’ve got to get every sort of support around me you know sort of put it on like a cape. And I think for me that… that was the… the role of the… the very first supervisor I had. There was somebody that was going to keep me safe because I… I didn’t feel you know at that time that I could do it on my own. 

00:47:05
SARAH ROGERS And it must be a terrible experience if you don’t have that feeling, you know feeling and say for the supervisor for whatever reason. 

00:47:10
JAN GRAY Yeah, something there is much responsibility in the role of supervisor than the trainees. Umm… because I think they can wield a lot of power that can be quite damaging. 

00:47:25
SARAH ROGERS It’s a combination of mentor teacher… 

00:47:30
JAN GRAY Yeah over see it. Yeah. 

00:47:30
SARAH ROGERS Yeah the person who might be giving you an employment… 

00:47:35
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:47:35
SARAH ROGERS I mean I think as a trainee that’s a real issue… 

00:47:35
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:47:35
SARAH ROGERS You know what… what can I take somebody who I might be asking for a job. 

00:47:40
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:47:40
NORMA JAMES …who writes your report. 

00:47:40
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah. 

00:47:45
HELEN BURSTON That’s what I think its really important to have the clinical and management roles of supervision separated. 

00:47:50
SARAH ROGERS Yeah, which often they’re not in an agency setting. 

00:47:55
HELEN BURSTON Yeah, I’m aware of that. Yeah. It creates huge difficulties for being evaluated and… and… and you can’t therefore be as open as you need to be for the process to work. 

00:48:10
JAN GRAY Well, yes because that could be judgmental to… to the… your client well. Because if you don’t feel that you know the supervisor likes you or… or rates you. You’re less likely to bring the change in clients. And… and ultimately you… you know your clients you know are the ones who are going to suffer from that. 

00:48:30
HELEN BURSTON But it's… it's really important with all these kind of difficulties that… that their work through isn’t it? Rather than changing supervisor because there are difficulties. It's such a wonderful opportunity actually to work in the harem(ph) now with what’s going on between you and me around this work in terms of what we learned from that to take into out… with clients and working through difficult relationships. I mean, I think I’ve learned a lot myself as a therapist. How I felt in supervision. But I think there are real problems that arise though. I don’t know if everybody here, you worked in supervision yourselves? 

00:49:10
JAN GRAY I don’t. 

00:49:10
HELEN BURSTON You don’t, you too. 

00:49:15
NORMA JAMES Not at the moment, I’ve done it but not at the moment. 

00:49:15
HELEN BURSTON Yeah, because I think… I think there is a real difficulty as a supervisor talking from the other side of it. Umm… that if you are actually not confident in your supervisee in the work that they do. How do you deal with that, it’s a dilemma you recognized that your supervisee needs to feel safe and needs to feel supported but actually you know there is some real issues that need to be challenged and that could really wobble things considerably. You know it's a quite difficult one to find that balance. 

00:49:50
SARAH ROGERS Yeah and the separation, you know you are talking about of clinical management helps that I think, but it's not something certainly that I’d really thought about probably when I was choosing my agency for my for… for my hours. I really hadn’t understood the significance of that in a way that I did whilst I was doing it. 

00:50:05
HELEN BURSTON Hmm… But now what… what I was talking about then was… was… was a problem within clinical supervision… 

00:50:10
SARAH ROGERS Hmm… Yeah. 

00:50:10
HELEN BURSTON …that, that if the supervisor has some doubts about the work of the… of the supervisee which are just about their work rather than about their role in the organization or… or whatever. 

00:50:25
JAN GRAY But I… I suppose that brings onto how do you know when you’re well enough to work, how do you when you… you need to take time out, you know, you would hope that your supervisor would be… you know either you would have some awareness that perhaps you’re not working well at the moment and perhaps need to take a rest or timeout, but you would hope that your supervisor will have to say that. 

00:50:45
SARAH ROGERS So, how do you… how do you know that you were not working well or how do you stop yourself getting into that position? 

00:50:50
JAN GRAY Umm… that’s another good question. 

00:50:55
HELEN BURSTON And… and impossible to round so, really I think because it comes over… of umm… reflection and awareness and expiration, just exploring… exploring something brings eventually some kind of clarity, but there isn’t an easy answer. 

00:51:10
NORMA JAMES I think its… that… that the relationship you have with your client, if things are getting on top of you. If you are feeling uh… very tired and… and burnt out, I think its absolutely essential that the relationship is strong enough so that you can voice it and open it up. And I think in discussion, it might be enough to say, its okay. Yeah, but if… if you’re not going to own that in supervision and it might… it might just continue. 

00:51:45
JAN GRAY Hmm… Yes. I… I suppose the fear for a lot of people is that if I… if I’m burnt out then I’ll never get back you know and I’ll have to stop forever and… and it’ll mean this and it’ll mean this and… and I… and I suppose realistically there are… there are times when you’re going to need some timeout yourself. 

00:52:05
HELEN BURSTON And I think that… that kind of, I don’t know if its where you were going to move towards next Sarah, but there’s something about umm… the kind of support that we… we all need and what you know how… how to prevent that burn out happening by what we put in place in order to support us. I mean I think I got close to burn out umm… about four or five years ago and didn’t… didn’t… didn’t in the end have to stop working. But it taught me some serious lessons about, for instance how many clients I could cope with, how many different kinds of work I could be managing at the same time in the course of a… a given week, what strategies I was using to kind of switch off from one client in order to be fresh and ready for the next client. What I needed to do when I took time off in order to refresh me you know… 

00:53:05
JAN GRAY So, I'm always wondering did you need to get to that point in order to be able to set those things in place? 

00:53:10
HELEN BURSTON I think I probably did. 

00:53:10
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:53:10
HELEN BURSTON Its always the way, isn’t it? We interrupt bottom before you cut you know the lessons. 

00:53:15
JAN GRAY I think there’s an… I there’s an and then normally because I think to work 37.5 hours a week counseling, I… I would think it would be unrealistic and you would risk burning. But then as… as Helen was saying you then, in order to… to work you probably do have diverse and different joke. So then you… you… you’ve got that risk that you got too many things on the… the go at… at one side. It is about balance isn’t it? 

00:53:40
NORMA JAMES I mean it's really have taken onboard self care, I… I think there’s a tendency in… in… in counselors to… to give out and to give out and to give out. And… and we could talk about self care and we can teach others about self care, but we variably miss out doing that for ourselves and… and… and I own(ph) that. And yet, it isn’t… it isn’t an option. 

00:54:10
SARAH ROGERS Hmm… 

00:54:10
NORMA JAMES You know it… its really down, its there in… in the ethical framework. Its such an important aspect of our work to care and to nurture ourselves. 

00:54:20
JAN GRAY Yeah. Well, we are the tools of our trait, don’t we really, and… and I suppose if… if you wouldn’t keep your tools dirty and rusty umm… but I guess a lot of people don’t look after the main tool that they use. 

00:54:35
NORMA JAMES Which is ourselves. 

00:54:35
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:54:35
NORMA JAMES Absolutely. 

00:54:35
HELEN BURSTON So, how do we all do it? something has to… 

00:54:40
SARAH ROGERS And because you were talking about strategies that you had for refreshing ourselves between clients is that… that was with you what do I do so. 

00:54:50
HELEN BURSTON Okay. Well, I said don’t ask for the client leaves and I write my notes and I’ve… I’ve reduced my the… the full map by which I do that now that its quite concise umm… before I found I had packers and pages and went on and on going more and more, not getting any sort of sense of completion aorund took the piece of work I just done because of it was spiraling somewhere, you know. So, I’ve reduced that format, so I spent about five minutes doing that then I shut the folder and that’s very important, the shutting and putting it away in the filing cabinet. Umm… and then I might go and make myself a drink or have a wheel, go and have a look at the river or do something which involves a change of activity, a change of movement umm… before I open the folder for the next client and read the notes from the previous week. Umm… I… at one time I used to work back-to-back on the hour with clients for 50 minutes with so five, ten minutes between each one wasn’t enough. I would get absolutely worn out, I would muddle up material from one session to another. So now, I leave 40-minute gap between each client. So, if I have one at 10, they leave at 10 to 11 and then I see the next one at 11.30. Umm… I don’t see anymore than five clients a day, I used to just see seven, umm… and it… and it was too much and they didn’t get the best of… out of me those last two clients of the day. Umm… I can’t… I realize that my limit is about 16 sessions a week and then I’m really tired, if I… if I took try to anymore than that. And… and also there’s something about the number of very difficult clients I’m carrying, so I… I feel if I got a lot of sexual abuse clients in my case load that takes more, I feel more depleted by that. Umm… so I try and managed my client load, so that I have a… a kind of range of what’s the word. 

00:56:55
NORMA JAMES Different activities? 

00:56:55
HELEN BURSTON Yes, that’s what the difference. So yeah, so some clients and clients, it sounds like the therapy clients, some… and that… and be working at different stages of work with different people as well. So I… I would try not to start with a load of new clients all together. Umm… so I have to sum who I’ve been seeing for five years and some might be seeing for one year and some might just started with. That’s the ideal, anyway and… and… and it’s hard to make sure that that happens, but with an awareness that that’s what needs to happen. I can try and manage it better than I might have done and I say, no much more no than I ever used to. I always find that difficult, but I have to do that to protect myself. And I take quite long holidays to… and so I take by two weeks at Christmas and Easter and three or four weeks in the summer. 

00:57:55
NORMA JAMES Yeah, and then the same way that Helen closes her folder, her file. When I walk out to the… you know the… the hospital, my clients stay… stay there until I meet them the… the following week. And I think it took quite a long time to be able to do that when… when I was a you know there root(ph) key trainee counselor, I… I think oh, what have I done now, how have I been with them or how well they and they would be in my head quite a long time. And that that’s tiring, that’s tiring I think so to separate out, separate though. 

00:58:35
HELEN BURSTON I mean that’s a bit realistic. Sometimes, clients do stay in our house and those maybe the ones that we take to supervision. 

00:58:45
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:58:45
HELEN BURSTON Because there is something that’s kind of nagging at us about what happened. 

00:58:50
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:58:50
JAN GRAY But there is something about boundaries, isn’t there about umm… having, especially if you’re working from home that that… for me, its clear that there are clearly found boundaries between what’s workspace and what’s home space and I find the room that I see the clients and is a room I don’t go into unless I’m working. And because somehow it’s umm… it… it’s my workspace and… and I want to close the door and I want that to… to… to not be with me. And I think that’s harder when you’re working from home to… to do that. 

00:59:25
SARAH ROGERS And is that something than that just comes with experience do you think miscibility to shut, close down as it were? 

00:59:35
NORMA JAMES I think its disciplined. 

00:59:35
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah. And… and I think its also about having good supervisions, so you know that you’ve got that space to take them. 

00:59:45
HELEN BURSTON But it is… it is also about kind of valuing importance of boundaries I think, isn’t it and recognizing the very positive element of boundaries is I think I know that when I first umm… trained I saw boundaries as quite a bad thing umm… uh… I didn’t want to stop at the end of 50 minutes sometimes it felt, inappropriate to suddenly cut off umm… what… what the client was saying and so we have to stop now umm… I’ll see you next week. It felt like I was giving less to the client, but I’ve now recognized through bitter experience really that the holding boundaries is… is… is an incredibly positive thing to do for a client, it's very containing. 

01:00:35
NORMA JAMES Yeah it is much as boundaries within the session, I mean that in those part we’re contracting it. You… you… you might say you know in the form of words to client if we meet out side of here, however we to talk not, do we acknowledge one another you know. 

01:00:50
HELEN BURSTON And that… I think that’s particularly important to do that if you’re working and living in the same locality. 

01:01:00
NORMA JAMES Yes, yes, 

01:01:00
HELEN BURSTON And you know you go off to despise(ph) or whatever and you’re pretty well bound to see one or two kinds pretty much every time you’re going to the supermarket because you’ve… you’ve seen a lot of people over the years. And… and so yeah, I think it’s really important to discuss that kind of thing with people so that they know where you stand. And I… and I don’t think there is a set of rule for how you should behave and what you should do. I think you’ve to work that out for yourself and thinking back in point of view, how… how it would feel for the client if you’re a sort of friendly and chatty and things and you saw them when they were with their mother who perhaps didn’t know that they were seeing you for counseling and might say to the client afterwards who was that. You know so there… there are a lot of things to think about I think. 

01:01:55
SARAH ROGERS Yeah. I mean the other thing I was thinking of is sort of like through really the other side of coin and this might reflect my inexperience and may be sense of self but umm… clients seeing me out of the counseling room as well I think that has an impact on me you know and being out my friends and behaving in a way that I wouldn’t behave, you know that feel slightly weird and feels like something that needs to dealt with. 

01:02:20
HELEN BURSTON Yeah, it's… it's… yeah, it's difficult for both people I think. 

01:02:25
NORMA JAMES I… I don’t think it can ever be entirely boundaried because you know particularly in… in a social setting. What are you going to do if you have a glass of wine in your hand you know and you’ve had a couple of glasses of wine and… and you see your client coming in stage left. Do you sort of try and hide it or you know you start being human, but you can’t engage, you cannot engage and… and that’s, that’s the… the balance to keep it. 

01:03:05
HELEN BURSTON But I think the most important thing is not what you do in that situation, but how you understand it together afterwards. 

01:03:15
NORMA JAMES Yes, yes. Yeah. 

01:03:15
HELEN BURSTON And… and so, you know at… at potentially embarrassing situation you know in society we tend to avoid embarrassing situations by not talking about them in the therapeutic relationship that’s the most important thing to talk about at that moment. 

01:03:30
JAN GRAY Yeah, and of course, there are some clients, the whole idea of having someone has listened to them umm… and… umm… worked with them for a longtime, for some clients to understand that you’re not their friend and that when it ends, it ended because you’ve actually worked together and… and hasn’t been I’m… I’m thinking in particular of… of clients who perhaps were sent for counseling actually, so the whole idea, the whole concept they have no idea of what counseling or therapy meant. So, they perhaps were unclear to start with that it… that it is a working you know contractual relationships and so it’s important to be quite clear at the start. 

01:04:20
SARAH ROGERS It is like contracting at the beginning. 

01:04:20
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:04:25
SARAH ROGERS It’s important, particularly with clients who haven’t sorted out. 

01:04:30
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah it is almost at the start that you know that it is going to end. So, you know you’re sort of talking about the endings at the start, but this isn’t, you know you and I meeting now forever. 

01:04:40
NORMA JAMES Yeah and it’s… it’s… its a strangest of relationships I guess because a… a counseling relationship will probably be for some people, the deepest relationship they had ever had with anybody in their lives. You know and they might well consider you a friend uh… you know, but it’s not… it's not. No matter how deep that relationship is, it… it is a therapeutic relationship. 

01:05:15
HELEN BURSTON And then it can be very painful… 

01:05:15
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

01:05:15
HELEN BURSTON …contact for… for somebody to have, have expose so much of themselves to somebody, and then to come to the end and that final line being drawn. I think it’s quite difficult to do justice to what it means to end a relationship like that through the ending process. And I think in my own therapy, I didn’t, I don’t I fully appreciate it what it meant to end that relationship until months after it had finished. So I… I do think it is something that’s really important, and I think it is some, I mean it’s… it’s something that needs to be given time. So clients when they feel ready to leave might say oh, I was thinking I might go on for another couple of sessions and invariably, I will encourage a longer time period than… than they think. 

01:06:20
SARAH ROGERS To be able to end properly. 

01:06:25
HELEN BURSTON Yeah. 

01:06:25
SARAH ROGERS And how did that different for you than in GP practice where you were very fixed six or seven sessions. 

01:06:30
HELEN BURSTON Well, I think that’s like you were saying about you acknowledge the ending almost right at the… right at the start, so you’re always working towards that six session or eight session or whatever it is. 

01:06:40
NORMA JAMES I guess it’s a bit large from the word go. 

01:06:45
SARAH ROGERS Yeah, start. 

01:06:45
JAN GRAY And there’s merits in both isn’t it, there’s merits in having that explicit the start and there is also a merit in… in the client having that long period that they sound as if they have with you Helen umm… much longer than, then I would tend to lot of clients. 

01:07:00
HELEN BURSTON Yes, yes. 

01:07:05
JAN GRAY But I’m also aware that there are some clients that I don’t like to end with because there’s some clients that I would really like and I feel really sad and… and I don’t think the clients are necessarily aware that you know there is still some clients and I think, why I wonder what they doing and I really like that client and… and of course you… you come and chase you know there’s some I left to know what they’re doing now because it's the work we did together. And of course, you… you can’t… you can’t do that. 

01:07:35
HELEN BURSTON Would you, would you acknowledge that with them? 

01:07:35
JAN GRAY Oh, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. 

01:07:40
HELEN BURSTON Hmm… yeah. 

01:07:40
JAN GRAY Yeah. And I think sometimes they are quite surprised that, that you’re sorry to see them. 

01:07:50
NORMA JAMES So sometimes doing for us as well. 

01:07:50
SARAH ROGERS Yes. 

01:07:50
NORMA JAMES at last a the therapist. 

01:07:55
JAN GRAY If you think about it, we have a lot of endings and all that. So, you’ve all the intensity and all those endings. 

01:08:05
NORMA JAMES Let’s see lots of again I told you… 

01:08:15
SARAH ROGERS Because as a student, I think before you start doing counseling, that’s a very hard thing to get how important endings are. 

01:08:20
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:08:20
HELEN BURSTON Hmm… 

01:08:20
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

01:08:20
SARAH ROGERS So it’s… 

01:08:20
 Because most endings in life are imposed on us suddenly I guess there are… there are certain… 

01:08:30
SARAH ROGERS And there’s no question of ending with pain and distress for a lot of people I think and so I healthy world, finishing that is going to be painful distressing, but like you’re saying my therapist, I’m not experienced on what you think I’m experiencing. 

01:08:45
NORMA JAMES Really talking about boundaries at our service they still do home visits. I know whether agencies do that as well crews still do it. And we have to… to health and safety report, but it never quite prepares you for because you step into somebody else’s home, they are not on part and they’re not within your environments. So you really don’t know what you’re going to be meeting, you know and you can have the television on, you can have the dog sort of bringing you a ball to throw, you could have (inaudible ), I mean it’s much, much more difficult to set the boundaries there. Umm… And… and telephones ringing and… and clients getting up or you know somebody coming in with a plate full of sandwiches would you like and it's all man kindly(ph) and in the whole visits there has to be a real transition between a friendly chat you know to this is a… a counseling hour and… and it can’t be quite difficult, quite challenging and demanding. 

01:10:00
HELEN BURSTON I would find that so different to me. 

01:10:05
JAN GRAY And I think it’s very hard for the client because if you’re dealing with a difficult issue the there is no way for them to go. They are left with the feelings but they are also left with the feeling in their home at least when the client comes to see you. They, they have to leave that room, get in the car or go in the bus whatever. So they have that opportunity to… to… to leave it somewhere, to some extent. Yes one of the agencies I worked for we worked in people home and I would really try encourage and to meet in a… in a neutral place. 

01:10:45
NORMA JAMES Yeah I’ve stopped doing it. I… I work entirely you know within the… the hospital. 

01:10:50
HELEN BURSTON The other aspect of boundaries is the issue of knowing or vaguely recognizing the person that has come to see you as a client or realizing as you’ve once you've started the work that there is a connection… 

01:11:10
NORMA JAMES Yes… yes. 

01:11:15
HELEN BURSTON …that, that could create a real difficulty. And… and you know I think those are amongst the most difficult situations I ever experience. 

01:11:25
SARAH ROGERS And how… how do you deal with that if you’ve already started the process? 

01:11:30
HELEN BURSTON Well I suppose through the relationship is the… is the… is the simple answer. But… but sometimes it does the exploration or not even the exploration, but the realization of what the… the boundary difficulty is and makes it completely untenable to continue the work. But I… I think except in those extreme situations where there is a very close connection I think the awareness needs to be out in the open and feelings need to be freely expressed on both sides about the situation. And, and then may be things put in place, how I will be if I see you in this situation, reinforcement of the confidentiality bond that you’ve made with that person. 

01:12:25
JAN GRAY And I suppose it’s also having that network that if fall out, fails you’ve got some on them to that you can say you know I… I… I… I can't see anymore that I know somebody who can. 

01:12:40
NORMA JAMES And to facilitate that transition as well. 

01:12:45
JAN GRAY And I suppose if you live in a relatively small community and you are working you know and you’re working for a period of time that’s more and more likely to happen that you’re going to be working with family members or people that you know. 

01:13:05
HELEN BURSTON And it's quite hard for other professionals to understand what the difficulties are about. And I remember working in doctor surgery and so, we have to do with that kind of thing all the time you know. We see all different members of the family and they, they cannot understand that it causes a real difficulty in the work. 

01:13:25
SARAH ROGERS In one of the agencies I worked they've a very formal assessment sheet it is two sides of A4, huge history to be taken. And one of the difficulties I’ve encountered is if you… if I have got very distressed or client or somebody who really doesn’t want to be there and so it is almost monosyllabic. And I was wondering how you if you find that difficulty and how have dealt with that. 

01:13:50
HELEN BURSTON I would abandon the, the process and, and address what’s, what’s happening for the… for the client and come back to it at at time but negotiate that with the client that's what I would do. It can feel very brutal sometimes to impose a lot of questions on a client in such a distress state. And I think we can underestimate what a huge step is for somebody to come along and see somebody and how much have buildup there will have been in those days in those days leading up to the appointment. And to… to… to go through a very kind of structured inquisitorial process can be yeah very harsh. 

01:14:40
JAN GRAY Although in some ways I can see that having some structure and I would say this wouldn’t I can be away these in I mean the process as well. So I think I would try and make it exquisite that this would meet the we got through. Because I mean speaking pragmatically that there for the hour and if they are not able to talk at all because they are distressed in the hour they made and they’ve got six sessions. You know they may go away and think nothing happened in that hour and I’m… and I'm thinking that possibly by allowing them to go through the questions then yet they regained their… their… their… their you know they bring themselves back down enough than to talk about the problem. And but I'm only hypothesizing here because I… I don’t have to do that. So I’m not sure if I would and I’m aware that where I do work in hospital and is quite structured very often we would necessary talk about the issue that they have come to talk about whether talk about something completely different. So I think I’m probably doing when you are doing Helen. I’m putting this… I’m putting this side. But I’m just thinking about myself that sometimes of not being very tearful and very distressed. It’s helped me that somebody has given me some questions to answer so that then bring me back enough to a point where I’m able to talk about my problems is that make sense. 

01:16:10
SARAH ROGERS Yeah, it’s a kind of distraction from it, tends to the feeling. 

01:16:15
HELEN BURSTON But I… I… I think in a way the first session you… you start as you mean to go on really don’t you? And I think you, that the response that we show to the client in that first session is really indicative of how, of what they might hope to get from… from the process. So I think there is a real danger in ignoring distress or making it easier to manage. I don’t know what I communicate to the client. Does I communicate, oh this client is not able to deal with me being tearful. You know she is going to resort(ph) to the format. 

01:17:00
JAN GRAY I must think there is a real art isn’t it and been able to hold that and actually work with it. Because for some people tears don’t necessarily mean that they are not able to work. But I think very often and again I suppose I’m speaking from my own experience that I can… I can be tearful and distressed but so want to work. But it is whether or not I as a therapist the counselor have heard that and it is how sensitively it's dealt. 

01:17:30
HELEN BURSTON Yeah absolutely I think it is how sensitively it is dealt with and judging what might be right for one client may be wouldn’t be right for another. 

01:17:35
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah and I think… 

01:17:35
HELEN BURSTON But I think what I’m saying is I think we should wo do attached to the process of you know first session is your assessment, second session we get over the… the business. I think the business starts the minute they pick up the phone or walk through the door. 

01:17:50
JAN GRAY And I think that’s one of the dangers of CBT I have to say that… that it can be very often be to the process led, to the judgment of relationship and if it I’m thankfully it is changing. I mean it’s… it’s changing because of course the assessment will be carrying on all the way through. And… and I suppose the assessment the case of conceptualization would be… would be something will be quite exquisite anyway as part of… as part of the work. So I’m not sure if there is a same of assessment you’re… you’re talking about. 

01:18:25
SARAH ROGERS Yeah I mean the sheet, those sheet that I’ve to deal with this you know personal details, GPS details alcohol and drug use issues so you’ve got feeling about issues, suicidal risk and rest of the thing. 

01:18:45
NORMA JAMES I mean we… there is a requirement that we make that sort of assessment but I think when I… when I work when I meet the client for the first time that’s my aim is to meet that client wherever he or she is. You know there are ways I mean to filling in your sheet. You know without losing saying that… that connection with your client. 

01:19:10
SARAH ROGERS That's what make me feel better because I’ve often felt guilty that I’ve been in one session or two filled half of it because we haven’t got that yet. But I think there is a quite a lot pressure and quite little agencies to be matured(ph) to a extent. 

01:19:25
HELEN BURSTON And… and I think the anxiety with which the client comes is the most important thing to acknowledge before any doctor details or, or whatever I think more clients have been lost have never returned because feelings were acknowledged in that first session of work. 

01:19:40
JAN GRAY And I’m surprised that you would have be having to do that because agency that you know agency experience I’ve had is all of that would have happened so that my assessment will be first and would be very different. I wouldn’t see that as a part of the assessment I would see as a part of you know I would have got that the client. 

01:20:05
JAN GRAY At the point of booking that almost. 

01:20:05
HELEN BURSTON They are working in different ways don't they, they are agencies. 

01:20:10
JAN GRAY That I think it is I don’t think it is an art as much as it is a science, it is an art isn’t it. 

01:20:20
NORMA JAMES Like its big precious of collogue, but it’s really a sensitive balance of needs I guess. 

01:20:30
HELEN BURSTON And we make mistakes all the time…

NARRATOR The School of Health and Social Sciences at the University of Wales, Newport is developing a wide range of videos and DVDs aimed at counselors, counseling trainers their students and that anyone interested in developing their use of communication skills. We offer programs demonstrating good practice and bad practice. We give critiques of the use of counseling skills. And we explore the way in which those skills can be used in a variety of helping settings. Using a wide range of examples in an informative, but lighthearted manner we look at the ways in which help and support and counseling can be offered, both in face-to-face work and over the telephone. We have also developed a series of programs in which key practitioners discuss their work and ideas. In this series in common with all the material has been welcomed by many counseling trainers. If you're a trainer, a counselor, a student or someone who uses counseling skills as part of their everyday work, we think that will have something to interest you. Call for brochure or visit our website and see what we've got to offer.
