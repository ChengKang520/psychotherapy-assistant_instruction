STRUGGLE FOR IDENTITY 

00:00:00
Issues in Transracial Adoption 

00:00:00
JOSH 

00:00:50
JOSH I was born in 1977, and my parents were told they couldn't have any more kids so they decided to look towards adoption. And I don't know exactly how or why they adopted transracially, but they did. And I came along. I was a "failure to thrive" child. I had braces on my legs, was told I wouldn't walk, and a whole bunch of other crazy stuff. But they still adopted me. 

00:01:20
MARTIN Josh's Dad 

00:01:20
MARTIN We wanted to have a larger family and we did not wish to have too many more people brought into the world, so the next step was by adopting them. The first son that we had was, was biracial and therefore considered hard to place. Um, it fit us just perfectly. 

00:01:40
ALISON 

00:01:40
ALISON I came to America and I was placed in a family that I was supposed to have been adopted by, but I wasn't what they had expected, so a family who had seen me come off the airplane adopted me um, 11 months after I came to America. I have um, there's five of us that are all adopted. 

00:02:00
ROBERT Alison's Dad 

00:02:00
ROBERT When the whole thing in Vietnam happened with the fall of Saigon and the sudden coming of um, this one group of children from Saigon. Um, one of them was placed with us uh, on two weeks notice, as I remember. 

00:02:10
JEAN Alison's Mom 

00:02:15
JEAN I was clear about wanting a child, that the child didn't have to look like me. It didn't seem like an important piece of the process. 

00:02:20
JOHN 

00:02:25
JOHN When I was growing up, my parents were pretty liberal, and this was during the Civil Rights Movement. And people were really coming, trying to become colorblind, I think, and trying to move towards integration and whatnot. This was all before the Black Power movement and kind of this backlash to liberalism. And because I was biracial, my parents pretty much raised me just to be a human being. They didn't really teach me that I was Black. 

00:02:50
MARTIN 

00:02:50
MARTIN I don't know exactly what my mother was or what my father was, and so I'm kind of confused about that still, but I, I just identify myself as a Black person, and until I know any more, that's what I'm going to continue to identify myself as. 

00:03:05
MICHELLE 

00:03:10
MICHELLE I can tell you when I was 3 and 4 years old, I was shocked to see myself in the mirror. I, I was brown. You know, other than my brother, who was less brown than I was, everybody I, else I knew was white. So it was like, it was a reminder, every time I looked in the mirror, that I wasn't just like everybody else. 

00:03:25
SEUJAN 

00:03:25
SEUJAN My mom's a piano teacher, so we're playing piano together and, and I said, "Well, what am I?" cuz I was looking at my fingers on the keyboard which, you know, is very white, and I was looking at my mother's fingers, and she's blond and blue-eyed and very fair, and she said, "Well, I'm white, and your father's white, so you're white." And as I, I remember looking at my hands, well, wait, wait a second. I don't think I am quite white. 

00:03:45
JOHN I knew right away that I wasn't white. But then there's like this vacuum that you have to fill, cuz you have to be something in America, you know? The other kids that were white made it really clear that, he's not white. We're not sure what he is, but he's not white. So I got called n****, I got called spick, I got called, you know, whatever. 

00:04:10
MARTIN I thought it was kind of strange to be adopted into a family that had white parents, but then, I, I had also learned that they had adopted other kids and the one that I knew I could relate to most would be my brother, Josh, because everyone else there, to me, they were white. 

00:04:30
JOSH 

00:04:30
JOSH Before my brother, Martin, came along, and my older sister, I was the only black kid in the entire town. It was, everybody else was white and, so my parents took me down to the zoo, down to Duluth, that's a long way away, and there's, there's some black people there. And we're in the zoo and I'm walking around, of course asking what every animal is. She says when I was just sitting back, looked up out of my, the stroller, and I pointed to African American kids in their stroller and I asked what kind of animal they was. And right there, my parents sort of stopped and thought about it, saying, he has no clue he's different. 

00:05:05
MICHELLE They began with a sense that this, I was just another child, but um, as soon as kindergarten came, I had my first incident in the kindergarten room where someone called me the n-word. And I came home and was really excited about it and actually said to my dad, I said, "Daddy, Daddy, someone called me a," you know, the word that rhymes with "trigger," and um, he. And I was excited, I didn't know what it was, and I had no clue when it was just an exciting day for me. So I think that was my parent's wakeup call that they were raising Black children. 

00:05:35
JOHN There are so many societal expectations and every time I walk into a room, people react to the way I look or the way I dress or the way my hair is or the color of my skin, and that can make me crazy. If you don't have some sort of frame of reference, which is why identity or this label becomes so important. I went through this whole period, my first couple years of college, where I rejected labels, and then I thought of myself as Brown for about a semester, or maybe a whole year or something. I said I'm not white, I'm not Black, I'm just gonna be Brown. I tried that out. But still, society doesn't work like that. They want you to make a choice, you know, as a biracial person, they want you to say. Are you Black? And that, it was never a choice to be white because it was very clear: you're not white. But what are you? Are you Black? And I finally, at the age of 22 or 23 came to say, yeah, I am Black. 

00:06:25
MARTIN I was listening to my Walkman and a Black guy comes up to me and he said, "What are you listening to?" I was like, "I'm listening to Pearl Jam." He's like, "That's white music. Can't be listening to that." He's like, "You got to listen to rap, reggae, all this other stuff. And I was like, it just, I was like, "It's what I like." He's like, "But it's like you're double-crossing the Black community." The way I see it, music doesn't see any color. It's, it's who you are and it's what you like, but I mean, that's one thing that just really discouraged me. He was like, he won't listen to that, you're not, you're not Black. 

00:07:00
JOHN I think I feel most comfortable in a multicultural setting. You know, it's kind of like people that are on the margins of their culture, whatever it is, you know, that's why I can feel comfortable in a room like this because we're not all African American, we're not all biracial, but we all have that experience of being marginalized from our cultures of origin. 

00:07:15
ALISON I don't even have to open my mouth when I go in a community of Vietnamese, um, so to speak, Vietnamese community, and they know I'm not Vietnamese. I lost a language, and it was something that uh, in American society, you have to speak English. And um, I hate America, and for the longest time I really did, I hate America. Um, I've grown to love it, now. Um, only because I was, you know, I'd been forced to live here, um, but it wasn't something that I wanted, you know? If, if they had asked me as a kid, what did you want, I would have told them, I wanted to go back to my country. 

00:07:50
MICHELLE In 1990, that was the first time I lived with Black people. And now, looking back at it, it was really horrible, or not horrible, but just interesting how a lot of stereotypes for my past and all that stuff came up. Oh my God, I'm going to live with those people. I have to get this kind of clothes, I have to start talking this way, I have to start acting this way, you know? And that was, you know, some of it isn't even who you say you are, but then how you present yourself to other people. And that I was suddenly going to be around African Americans, other people of color, meant suddenly I had change, I had to start looking at those issues. It was a very difficult summer. Where when I came in, I'm like, "I'm Black?" question mark? And they'd say, "No, you're not," or, "You're an Oreo," or "you're a Zebra," or, you know, I'm sure everybody here's heard a lot of those things. And by the end of the summer, what I really realized was that I had to take that back from them, I had to define myself, and basically, the question turned into a statement, "I am African American." I am who I am. You can take me or leave me as you choose, but this is how I define myself. I, I got to the point where I wasn't seeking their approval, and at the same time, um, I didn't feel that I had to fit in, I just was. 

00:08:55
JOHN How, how I came to identify as African American was by being around other African Americans. And I really didn't know any African American people until I got to high school, and there were just a few. And then really, in college, when I met other African American students, and I found myself gravitating towards them. It was kind of strange because I, I had grown up with all these stereotypes about what it meant to be Black and how I needed to talk. And, you know, God forbid if I had to do the handshake or something. I, I knew I was gonna mess it up cuz I, you know, I didn't know it, but, I mean, I knew that I wouldn't be seen as cool if I couldn't do it, or whatever. So there was all this anxiety. But so I plotted ahead and reached out and just found myself telling Black students um, my whole life story like, "This is why I'm so confused, and I don't know if I'm Black or white, or da, da, da, da, da," and they said, "Man, get over it. You a n**** just like us." You know, and, and like, I don't like to use that word anymore, but hearing them say it was like, oh, yeah, I'm one of the guys. I, I fit in. So it was sort of validating, even though it sounds negative. It was very validating. I also discovered, through the poetry of Langston Hughes and other African American writers, that this quest for identity is like the essence of being African American, of being of African descent in the Americas. And that it was something that all Black people, or people of African American descent, are struggling with, and it's not just something that I as a transracial adoptee was struggling with. 

00:10:20
MICHELLE When you're looking at interracial adoption, what you're really looking at is A, that most of the parents who adopt us adopt us because of infertility reasons, which means that they didn't really want us in the first place, but they couldn't get what they really wanted, so we're plan B, or C or D or Z, or whatever it is. 

00:10:35
JOHN And why did our parents adopt us, you know? And probably all adoptees go through that. "Why did you adopt me?" you know, "Why did you pick me?" But then because of the cultural or racial difference, it's, it's even more significant. 

00:10:45
SEUJAN My sister, who is Canadian-Indian, her nickname was Eagle-Eye. You know, and there were a few other, and it was very subtle, and my parents considered themselves to be very liberal, and they were even more liberal because they had adopted us kids. But they've never really explored their own racism, and I've gone back and I'm finally starting to challenge them on some of their stuff. But I think in addition to finding out who they're getting, they also figure, need to figure out who they are and why they decided to adopt kids of color. 

00:11:15
MICHELLE And there's also something about how parents respond to the whole thing about, "Oh, it was such a wonderful thing you did." That's racism. "Oh, God, you were just so wonderful for doing that. You made y-." You know, there's something about, you know, about some kind of a model of um, pathology in that. That you can be the divine savior, The Great White Hope, as, you know, I say and I kinda have to laugh about it, but, you know, there is that, that whole savior complex. If you're doing it for that reason, that's an altruistic reason, that's not a healthy reason. And I think at some point it's very hard because this is a class issue. Transracial adoptions are a class issue. White parents get these children cuz they can afford them. White parents get these children because the Black community can't, for a lot of reasons, socially, politically, culturally. And they know that and there is this kind of a power in that, that in many cases, it's a white caseworker who's giving the white parent the brown child. You know? And there's no questions. These questions aren't even asked. It's "What's your income, where do you live, you have a bedroom for the kid? Congratulations, you have a child." And a lot of those issues aren't dealt with in any kind of systematic way, and they have to be. They have to be, to serve us. 

00:12:15
ALISON The first family that I went into had no clue. I mean, they thought I was gonna be blond haired and blue eyed. If you're adopting from Asia, you're not gonna get that. And so they were very shocked when they saw me, you know, "Ooh, well, who's that?" Well, this is the person that you're, you know, you were supposed to adopt. And as it turned out, she really wanted a Barbie doll. She didn't want a child to love, she just wanted a Barbie doll. She wanted somebody, you know, that she could do the hair up and poke holes in their ears and dress her up. And, you know, I, I think that that's, that's, that has to be a priority is, do you really want adopt someone and take care of this person? 

00:12:55
MICHELLE In my family, I think, and I was blessed in a lot of ways. My parents made a decision, they made it before they adopted, they knew why. I knew that they wanted me for me. They had their white children. They didn't want any more white children. They really wanted to fill a need of the community and they had been connected with the community before they were adopting. I think a lot of parents now, it's like, you know, you get to that stage of, "Well, what would you do when you adopt?" "Oh, I'll go find some Black friends." I'm sorry, if you don't have them before you start the process, you need to stop. Honestly. You know, this isn't about suddenly making my house what I think you think it needs to be for me to have this child, the house should be that way before. The attitude should be that way before, you know? Children can't afford to be, you know, kind of the testing ground for this. This should have happened before. 

00:13:35
SEUJAN I remember we had these two dolls, that was it, and their eyes just were like these little slits, you know? And then my Barbie had these big, beautiful blue eyes. And, you know, it, as, as a parent who's possibly gonna have another child who's even more mixed-race than I am, you know, you really, I want them to see more images and I want them to see book with people who look them and with kids who look like them and look like other people. 

00:14:00
JOHN As a parent adopting two African American kids, um, I had, you know, I had to kinda go through that because in a way that's a transracial adoption because I was raised in a white environment and my aunts and uncles and grandparents and everyone are, are white. So why am I bringing these two black kids into this family? You know, and how am I gonna make sure that they've maintained their Black identity, while integrating into this family, you know? But I had an idea of, in my head, which I guess all of us as parents do, of the kind of child that I wanted to adopt. And I knew I wanted to adopt Black children because I'm Black and I wanted more Black people in my family, you know? And I felt like that was a valid reason. And I knew the, what I needed to do to make sure that they knew they were Black and were connected to the Black community and whatnot. I mean, I had done all that self-inventory stuff. 

00:14:45
ALISON If I picked out a child at the final stage, I would do research on that child's family so that, you know, I would know all about this kid and I could tell them when they're growing up. And then, not having any, you know, blanks drawn on them. There're a lot of blanks drawn on me. 

00:15:05
MICHELLE 

00:15:05
MICHELLE I think one of the major things that parents really have to understand is that this is a painful process, this is a very hurtful process in many cases. There're gonna be issues at every stage of this child's life that are painful. Um, and you're gonna have to be able to deal with that. You're gonna have to deal with a lot of rejection, not necessarily of you, but of your culture and a lot of the microcosms of a racist culture. 

00:15:30
SHERI Transracial Adoptive Mother and Michelle's sister 

00:15:30
SHERI If we as parents show that we value that other culture by ourselves being involved with, if it's Black adults or Korean adults or whatever, or ourselves go-, learning a Korean dance or learning Spanish or whatever it is, because I think kids that, when they're young, at least, so much of what they think is worth something is what we think is worth something. And if we just say, "It's worth something for you, but it's not worth something for me," then it doesn't feel to them like it's really worth something. 

00:16:00
MICHELLE My parents are Swedish-American. I know all about lutefisk and Swedish meatballs and the Sven and Ole stories and all that stuff that goes, I, I love it. That's what my parents were, and I love my parents, but at the same time, I have my culture and my stuff that they brought to me. So unlike a lot of the parents here, my dad and I sat and read Dr. King. We celebrated holidays. We hadn't done Kwanza till recently, but we do now. 

00:16:20
BETH Josh and Martin's Mom 

00:16:20
BETH I think that as the adult, you have to be willing to change. And I don't think it's the children that have to change, I think it's you that have to change. And when you show the changes in the way you're dealing with things, your kids will do the same thing that you do. 

00:16:35
JOSH My mom and dad, I think they have done lots and lots of things right and not too many things I can think of that are wrong, just because I view myself as Josh Jolles, nobody else. I have an, I don't think I will ever identify myself as being Black or white or anything like that just because that's the way I am. 

00:16:55
BETH You have to look at your family and to decide that your family is not a Caucasian family. And that you have to make that understanding so that if you were going to go someplace and your children are going to be stared at or looked at or asked questions about, that you help them come up with either answers or how to ignore or whatever the process is that you think is appropriate at that particular time. 

00:17:25
JOHN Given that we have racist police and given that Black males between the ages of 18 and 25 are really a targeted subgroup in the United States right now, unfortunately. Young men of color really need to be given survival strategies. They need to be taught how to respond when the police roll up on them. They need to be taught how to respond if they're being followed around in stores because people shoot first and ask questions later, and if we don't teach these young men to think through and to anticipate, at every turn, racism, they could end up dead, and that's the last thing that any of us wanna see. We're talking about survival strategies, and I believe that the people that can give those survival strategies the best are the people that have actually lived through that, which are other adults of color. So you've gotta find adults of color. 

00:18:15
SHERI It was helpful for me to have someone who had been through it who could either advise me or respond to the child directly. And so part of it, I think, one useful strategy for me is humility, which is to say, I'm not gonna be able to do all of these things myself. Some of it is things I'm going to have to provide the child with other places that they can find coping strategies. 

00:18:40
MICHELLE I used to get very angry growing up when I would look in my dad's den, my mom's bookshelf and see "How to Raise a Black Child." I'm like, why you need a manual for me that you didn't have for your other three kids? But there was an added recognition that, hey, we, we're, we're on a different track here, and we can't, we don't have all the answers, and we need to look to people who have parented Black children, who are Black parents, to give us the answers. 

00:19:00
JOHN You're white, why did you wanna adopt a Black kid or an Asian kid or a Latino kid? And there should be some sort of really. So much we, we attach so much significance to having an answer to that question that they can't just give us a flippant answer. You know, before they adopt, I, I think that they really need to think about how're you gonna answer that question at different stages? When your kid is 6, when your kid is 10, when your kid is 16, when your kid is 20, when your kid totally rejects you and, and goes back to the culture of origin, let's say, because sometimes that happens, and, and they go through their anti-white stage. What are you gonna tell that kid? Why did you adopt them? You know, what were you hoping to prove? Or what were you hoping to, to accomplish? To turn them into a white person? So they could go to college and, and live out the American dream? Or to raise another strong, proud, culturally-connected individual of color that's gonna help liberate their race or their people? I mean, you know, what, what are um, your motivations? And I think they way you answer that is really, really significant.

STRUGGLE for IDENTITY 

00:21:25
MICHELLE When I see the first video, you know, it was 10 years ago. We're very different people, but I wouldn't change anything that I said. 

00:21:30
JOHN Being the oldest person in the group, it was really interesting to kind of look at the people coming along and seeing myself in them at different stages. It really impressed on me that this is a life-long process. 

00:21:45
MICHELLE All of us have had to deal with racism, and all of us have had to deal with prejudice and justifying our families and our own lives, both in our communities of color as well as the adopted communities. 

00:22:00
JOHN Even in adulthood, the question lingers: where do we fit in? 

00:22:05
[sil.] 

00:22:05
Conversation 10 Years Later 

00:22:10
JOHN Because I was in the first video, I feel like that was an important experience, being in that, and knowing that it's had such a huge impact, um, and knowing that if it gets updated with extra features or something, it'll reach an even wider audience. I mean, that appeals to me because I feel like my perspective and Michelle's perspective is really valuable. Um, I miss the other people not being here because I think their perspective is equally valuable. But I think it's an important mission, you know, I really do. I think it's an important training tool and an important educational opportunity. And bottom line is, I wanna make some other adoptee's life easier than the road that I had. 

00:22:50
MICHELLE After a decade of people approaching me um, very differently, depending upon, of course, who it is, and um, basically you, most of the Black people are like, "Right on, sister." And my overall negative comment, or what people who are less um, I guess, I don't, I don't know what word to say, but who don't get it quite as much would say that I'm the angry Black woman in the video. "You're the angry Black woman!" And what I say to that is, "Well, I would like to think of myself as assertive, but thank you, yes, I'm glad you remember me!" 

00:23:25
JOHN I see your, what you're describing as anger, as passion. You know, you're passionate about this issue and I feel passionate about this issue too. And I think sometimes I have come across as angry. I'm not, I'm not sure if people hear me as the angry adoptee in that video, but I know that earlier presentations that I've done over my career, people have labeled me that way. But to me, it's passion for the issue. 

00:23:45
MICHELLE But you have to also understand that there is an emotional toll. And I think that the analogy that we made was that we do these things and a part of this is, you know, we're bleeding. You know, we're, we're exposing a lot of our really difficult issues or painful experiences, but all with the hopes that other kids will have to do less, and that parents will do more. 

00:24:10
JOHN I feel very comfortable going on camera and talking about it publically. Kinda make it normal and say, yeah, it's controversial. Here's what I think works and here's what doesn't work, but be ready. Like, you can't just think you're gonna adopt this kid and everything's gonna be hunky-dory, and it's, you know, and everyone's gonna be fine with it. For the rest of our lives, people are gonna be reacting to this family configuration. And I don't think people realize that when they're walking into this. And I don't think they're prepared for that, and I think they're shocked by some of the hostility that they come up against. 

00:24:45
Taking Race Seriously 

00:24:50
MICHELLE My parents, and my father in particular, when they made this decision to adopt, some of his, his own aunts and uncles um, were, were vehemently opposed to this. "What was your problem, because you'd done this perfect thing and you had these blond, blue-eyed children the first time, and why would you do this?" was kind of their answer to that situation. And why I say that all the people that I knew and grew up with were supportive is, my father made the decision to cut those people out of his life. And it was very clear and it was very quick and it's, if you don't agree with what decision I'm making, you are no longer welcome in my house. 

00:25:30
JOHN I talk a lot about that when I'm talking to families. Um, it's about yo-, like, you make, you made the choice to adopt and to take in a child of another race, and that child comes from a community of people that look like him or her and probably will find their way back to that community at some point. So um, it's like, as a white person taking race seriously and taking anti-racism seriously. 

00:26:00
MICHELLE I never questioned that my parents loved me or were committed to me. That advocacy was there and frankly, sometimes it was there when I didn't want it to be there. Because I think that's one of the other harder things, is that we say we want you to be on our side and we want you to advocate for us, but some of those moments of advocacy are embarrassing or are, especially during the teen years, you know, I don't, I didn't want my parents to march into the principle's office and say that there was a racist teacher or this activity was racist or insensitive um, when I was a teenager because it's embarrassing. You, and you already stick out enough and you didn't certainly want anybody else, especially your parents, pointing it out to you. But you gotta give 'em um, props for that because they, they didn't care. The difference, it didn't matter. Their child was having an issue and they were there to advocate. 

00:26:45
JOHN It's like a commitment. That's, that's what it takes. It's a, it's a, it's an emotional, philosophical, political, intellectual, moral commitment to stepping up and being there and to taking it seriously. 

00:26:55
MICHELLE That's one of the things I talk about when I train, and I've trained this tape a hundred times, different countries, here um, in the States, whatever, is to really say that, you know, people get upset with me by saying, "Oh, I, do I have to go to that level? I really love my mother who, who in all other regards is this supportive person, but, yeah, she, she says stupid things or she says racist things, but it's okay," and I kinda, "No, it's kinda not okay." I think a lot of those, those of us who have dealt with some of those things can talk about just how damaging those comments are and those getting different presents or not getting presents or not being in the will or all of those differences that are shown in nonverbal ways about, as well as verbal ways, but nonverbal ways about whether we really think you're a member of this family.

00:27:45
Transracialized Identities 

00:27:50
JOHN Something about the public nature of transracial adoption, a video like this really brings that up. And it is a public thing. And in my own research, you know, with siblings, like white kids that grew up with brothers and sisters adopted from other races, how publically on display they felt, and no one ever really thought to check in with them. And we were just talking about this, you know, like, going to the restaurant as a family, like, you really stand out. And I just, I knew that we adoptees felt that, but I never thought that my brother and sister, who are white, would be feeling that too. 

00:28:20
MICHELLE My parents did talk with my older three siblings who were all biological to them before they adopted, saying, "We wanna do this. Are you okay with this?" Now, true, they were teenagers at the time, but all three were on board before that decision to adopt was made and those discussions happened. 

00:28:35
JOHN The siblings that I was interviewing, they said, "You know, this is the first time anyone has every really asked me about this, and I have a lot to say about it. There were great things about it, and I feel incredibly blessed that my parents did this, but at the time," some of them said, "I thought it was a mistake, I resented it, I couldn't say that cuz I didn't wanna appear racist." I mean, they had really intense feelings and no one has thought that, to validate those feelings or even to bother to inquire about them. Based on my dissertation research, I came up with this idea of transraciallized identities. And there were some siblings that I talked to, white siblings, that somehow got to this new way of performing their white identity that I called "transraciallized." And those were the ones that did become anti-racist allies to their siblings of color, and they did b-, take up the discourse on race and anti-racism in a really principled and thoughtful, politically clear way. 

00:29:25
MICHELLE I think a lot of the people that we talk to and a lot of our colleagues, at moments, they have been left standing by themselves, and parents have not been on their side. And that is a very scary place to be. And that is where you can lead the questioning about whether they really do A, have your back, but B, will they be with you for the long haul if there's a certain situation that's going on right now and Mom and Dad have disappeared and you're on your own. 

00:29:50
JOHN Like, one of the siblings in my study said, if it's an offense against my Black brother or sister, it's an offense against me. Like it's that organic for her. So it's not just like, oh, where some of the other siblings are like, "Well, yeah, I understand that my Korean sister had some issues in high school, like boys didn't wanna date her or whatever or," but they don't really get personally involved. They, it doesn't touch them. It doesn't have to touch them because they're holding onto their white privilege. But the siblings that I'm most impressed with, and, and parents, are the ones that take it so seriously that it hurts them as if it's happening to them. That it's not like, your issue, you go fight that battle and come back and tell us about it. Or, actually, don't even talk about it cuz it's too painful for me to even think that this is happening to my kid or my brother or sister. But the ones that walk hand in hand, side by side, and are there, emotionally present, validating the feelings, are educated enough about racism to know that it's a reality, that if your Black brother comes and says, "Yeah, I'm being followed around and profiled in this gated community every time I come home for Christmas," that you don't say, "Oh, it's all in your head." But you're like, "Wow, this is a real issue. Let's think about this. What can we do?" Not, "You go and fix it on your own cuz it's not my reality." But they get upset about it enough so that they're on their kid's side. It's their problem. It's a family problem. It's not just the kid's problem. Racism is not just the kid's problem.

00:31:20
Loyalty and Attachment 

00:31:25
JOHN I think many of us that are adopted into these sort of middle class or upwardly mobile families have like this survivor guilt, like why did I get this? And, am I turning my back on the hood? You know, can I still go home and be accepted or am I, are they gonna see me as selling out, are they gonna see me as trying to be white? I, and I think this is not, I think it's not unrelated to the adoption issues cuz of the split loyalties and the, the identity. Who am I like? Am I like these people in my extended family, or am I more like the people that I know I came from, the foster siblings that I left behind when I got adopted? What happened to them? I know one's in jail, I know one got shot. Here I am, I'm s-, I have all this opportunity, but I'm scared to do it because. 

00:32:10
MICHELLE This is an adoption issue, whether you look like your parents or not, is like, whether it was intentional or not, whether it was voluntary or not, your first attachment to your birth mother, often your birth family has been severed. And, for kids, I think, and my struggle early on and still on some days, I think is, if that first attachment can be broken, what guarantee do I have that any other attachment in my life can't be broken. 

00:32:40
JOHN In my own life I feel like I have to play catch-up to learn quickly, as fast as possible, all about the adoption issues of grief and loss and how that can impact your adult choices and relationships and whatnot um, that really are separate from race. And they can be teased out, and I think sometimes we have to, we have to tease it out because it's easy to just get so consumed with the race and culture issues. I had an interesting moment when I turned 40 a few years ago. And I was talking to a, a friend of mine in a, in a professional sort of mentor and advisor who's also an adoptive parent and has um, a challenging daughter, we'll put it like that. And we were comparing our kids' experiences and how heartbreaking it can be, you know, as a parent going though some of these issues with teenagers at home. And, and she sounded to me like, you know, it sounded like she was saying, like, you know, "After all we've done for this kid that we've adopted. I can't believe that she's kinda doing this to us." And I'm like, said to her, "Well, as an adoptee, I'm not gonna like, thank my parents for adopting me, that's just not gonna happen. My brother and sister didn't have to thank them for bringing them into the world, so why should I, you know, why should we be grateful?" And she said, "Well, you know," and she'd met my parents at my 40th birthday party, and she said, um, "You know, your parents are getting older, John, you should really rethink that." And so a few days later I happened to be on the phone talking to my parents, and I was recounting this conversation to them, just totally unrehearsed. I said, "You know, I was talking to," I won't say her name, "and it, and it occurred to me that I'd never really thanked you for adopting me and thank you for sticking with me when I was putting you through hell as a teenager." And I was just kinda like, saying all this. But my mom started, I could hear her crying on the phone. And my dad, who's usually also, sounds like your parents, very verbal and loquacious, was just like, breathing into the phone. It was, and for me, it was like this moment, this weight lifted of my shoulders cuz I, I was thinking, and I'm 40 years old, "So they waited 38 years to hear 'thank you' for adopting me and educating me and giving me this." And, and that was the turning point in our relationship. And I share that with families when I'm doing like, workshops and things because sometimes, and maybe, maybe you'll never get thanked, but maybe you have to wait 38 years or 40 years till the child emotionally adopts the parents. That's what it felt like. It's like, now I'm making this commitment on my own. I had no say over it before, as a kid. And I've gone though hell, and they didn't understand, and I've been angry and hurt, and I've pulled away, and I've forgiven. Now I adopt them. They are my parents. 

00:35:30

00:35:30
Creating Multicultural Families 

00:35:35
MICHELLE Even those of us who are successful and would say we have the best families and we had the best possible outcome based upon a difficult situation, that doesn't mean there wasn't pain and there weren't hard times or there weren't conflicts or there weren't times when we didn't feel like we truly, truly belonged. 

00:35:55
JOHN We're like the successful transracial adoptees. And you've kind of outlined different definitions of success, you know? We, we're successful, and we had a hard time. I don't want people to say, "Well that's just them, they were adopted in the 60's and 70's, they don't represent my kid adopted from Guatemala." Yeah, we do. When we talk to these teenagers, they are saying the same, they're saying the same issues. 

00:36:15
MICHELLE Kids from Russia. You know. 

00:36:15
JOHN They're saying the same things. If they're living those white bread existences, they're having our experience all over again. Now, if they're living in a very multicultural environment and their parents are transraciallizing their lives, yeah, then it's a whole new thing. 

00:36:25
MICHELLE It really starts with the social workers. You know, it starts with the people who arrange these adoptions and what happens when someone walks into an agency saying, "I want to adopt," or "I'm willing to consider children of color," and really assessing whether they have an understanding of what that means. Assessing whether you as a social worker have a concept of what that additional information will entail for you to do to prepare during the training and orientation process all the way through placement and post-placement services to help facilitate a successful adoption cross-culturally. 

00:37:00
JOHN If you form a transracial family, everybody should become transraciallized. That's the point. And it starts, as Michelle is suggesting, before a child probably comes into the family. 

00:37:15
MICHELLE My parents and my older siblings understood from the beginning that we were a multicultural family. So it wasn't uh, white parents raising Black and white kids. It was a multicultural family that had the culture of Africa and Sweden, or Europe, in it that were now together, moving through life. 

00:37:35
JOHN It troubles me to see that there are still kids being raised um, so they aren't really bicultural. So that they're not fluid and comfortable in both settings because that's the way they're, I mean, ideally we should all be that way, we should all become bicultural and comfortable in different settings. The hopeful thing that keeps me going is that I see families doing it. Very few, not enough, but I do see families. Like we were talking earlier about um, your parents and I was thinking about some of the families in my studies too, where the parents actually do, are proud of the fact that their daughter's in Korea. That's not a threat. They're proud of that. Or they're really proud that their son married an African American woman. That is, that to me is huge, but that's the rare parent that gets to that point. But to me, that's like a transracialization moment. It's like, yeah, they've come around the corner and seen life in a different way where it's not threatening anymore, and that's a good thing. That's like, yeah, our kid has to succeed on his or her own terms, and we can't walk that far with them. But we can push them out of the nest and be there when they come back for, you know? Like that, to me, is a successful transracial adoption. They don't have to turn out like you. They have to be the best whatever they are that they can be and function in the world and be accepted by others that look like them. As well as function with others who don't look like them. And that's a huge thing. But there are parents that are figuring out how to do it, and la-, I think they largely do it by having long-term, caring relationships with other people of color. 

00:39:10

00:39:10
Join the Struggle 

00:39:15
JOHN There's this whole discourse about race, and there's this whole discourse about adoption, and transracial adoption sits right at the crossroads of that. And you have to learn about both of those. And that's a huge thing to ask parents to do. And a lot of parents just don't do it. It's like, "This is way too much work. I just wanna raise this kid and love him, or love her. Now you want me to do what? And learn about what? Grief and loss and rejection and abandonment and, and race and racism and my white identity?" That's a huge thing that we're asking these families to do. 

00:39:50
MICHELLE Racism still does exist in the practice, in the bias, in the system, and we haven't dealt with it. And if you're saying that you're into equality studies or social justice or the sociologists who are always talking about reform and social movement, get off of it and really come and help these kids and all kids. 

00:40:05
JOHN I try to like, put it like an invitation to join the struggle, and you have to be really clear on, it's like developing political clarity about the issues so that you can take them personally. In my work as a teacher/educator, that's what I'm asking white teachers to do. If you're teaching kids of color and, you know, you're working in communities where there are lots of kids of color, or something, that's your responsibility, to take those seriously. Find out what the issues are in the community, step up, educate yourself about them, and, and go th-, out there and work in solidarity with the community. Make it your issue. It's not like you're doing it for someone else, you're doing it for yourself because you see how it's hurting you. It's hurting you and the people you love. It's your issue.

SEUJAN My biological mother's Korean and my biological father just basically says 'white' and he was an American soldier. So I kind of used Amer-Asian thanks to Pearl Buck. I guess, I mean, that was the word she came up with. But then when I went to college, I started identifying as biracial cuz I never could figure out why Amer- had to go first because they were kind of visiting Korea to begin with. They weren't there very long. They weren't taking any responsibility for these children they were producing. Why was I giving them top billing? So I used biracial and then I'll say Korean American or Korean white. 

00:42:45
ALISON When I first came to America, I considered myself Vietnamese. I was Vietnamese. Um, but then I met some Vietnamese folks, and they're like, "No, you're not Vietnamese." Um, and so the Americans said I'm not American and the Vietnamese say I'm not Vietnamese. So for me, I'm still struggling with, you know, what, who am I? 

00:43:05
JOSH Came into the house when I was 6 months old, very little. I'm white, Black, and Hispanic all combined. On uh, all my applications and everything for college, like you say, what am I, I just, 'Other.' I just, I wrote 'Other.' I've, I am a whole bunch of things so just put 'Other' and they, they usually don't make you write what you are. I mean, what am I supposed to write? Click all of them? White, Black, Hispanic, all the way down the line? So that's 'Other' for me. 

00:43:35
JOHN And I remember when I was a little older and I was applying for my Social Security card and they wanted to know, you know, you have to designate um, your ethnicity. And I had to ask my mom, you know, I was probably already a teenager, and I think it's really telling that I had to ask. Like, what should I put, you know? Should I put white, should I put Black? And she said, "Well put white for now, and if you ever, you know, change your mind, you can uh, you know, change it." So that's what I did. And so in Washington D. C. at the Social Security building, I'm listed as, as white. But now I strongly identify as African American or a person of African descent even though I'm biracial. 

00:44:15
MARTIN There was this one little girl, she was telling me, she's like, "You're Black." I was like, "No, I'm not. I'm brown." I can never really identify, like, with my color and really what it meant to me because I still um, had couple of encounters with that, such as in high school cuz like, um, people, they're like, "How come you're like, you're lighter than we are, how can you still call yourself Black?" 

00:44:35
ALISON It's hard because you find yourself in the middle of an all-white people and you don't feel comfortable. But then, when you're placed in a circle of your own peers, so to speak, um, Korean or African, you still don't feel comfortable. And, and you lack something. No matter what group you're put in, you lack something. And I think it makes it easier when we're all, you know, like in a circle, sitting like this, where it helps us, you know, when it's mixed because we don't left out. Well, she's in here, she's in here, and he's in here. You know, you don't feel left out. You're not isolated. 

00:45:15
JOHN So I need to know that I'm more than just a human being. You know, I mean that, that'll work in certain settings, but, but to me, the antidote to racism is a clear identity, regardless of what you choose it, or how you choose to label it. 

00:45:30
MICHELLE I had a lot of experiences growing up where I went to this Black church, and it was like, Sunday was church day, we were in the city, we were in the hood, you know, I had godbrothers and godsisters who were in the hood, in the neighborhood um, right across from the church. And for a lot of years, that was really our only true experience or contact with African Americans in any kind of an intimate setting. So then, when I was talking about African American, I think my identity of what it meant to be Black was what it meant to be like them. And I think over the years as I met more people, I understood that, you know, they weren't the only Black people around, they weren't, you know, that we weren't a monolithic people and that um, as I started to encounter other people, my, my understanding of what it meant to be Black or African American, depending upon what, how you want to talk about it, was um, limited, and I needed to learn more. 

00:46:15
MICHELLE I think when a lot the racist stuff comes up and the prejudice and all those things in the settings where there's Black and white, and you get it in both places, it's not just one or the other, there's ignorance on both sides. I never felt uncomfortable because I guess, growing up, you know, my parents said, "It's ignorance. They're just, they just don't know what you know and it, you can decide whether it's your role to teach or not to teach or to reject or to accept or to do whatever you wanna do," but in some ways, you know, they said, "That's not you. That's outside of you." And I think in some ways, that made me comfortable. If I'm coming into an unhealthy situation, it's an unhealthy situation. I'm not unhealthy. 

00:46:50
MICHELLE How do you talk to other people about your adoption? How do your parents describe you? You know, there's a whole thing about being 'real kids,' 'natural kids,' 'biological kids,' you know, that, you know, or adopted kids. You know, is this, you know, I, I always get very upset when, "Oh, this is my natural child, and this is my other child." I'm sorry, I'm their, I'm my adopted parent's natural children. I'm not their biological child, but there's something about this unnatural/natural business. There's something natural that parenting and loving a child that's universal. 

00:47:15
JOSH I think that parents should really think about what, what they're getting into, what, what they're actually doing before they just go ahead and sign a paper and they have a kid. Take the time to think about it, talk, talk to people about it, talk to random people about it, I mean, bring it up anywhere to make sure, make sure you know what you're doing and you know that you want to do it. So that, so that when it, and also to research behind everything, of just adoption itself, transracial adoption, the culture of the child, everything, before you get yourself into something that you don't know what you're doing. 

00:47:55
MARTIN Before um, people considered doing this, I re-, um, I strongly believe that they, they have to do deep research on this person's culture, um, and they need to know, they need to know, just, a lot about this person, where they're coming from, what their life is like, so when they come into their home, that they will feel at home, even though they're, they're thousands of miles away from where they came from. 

00:48:25
SEUJAN It's not enough to just love them. It, it's a lot more than love. It's a lot of education. It's a lot of really painstaking learning about yourself and it, I guess it takes more than love to do it. 

00:48:35
ALISON I think that the parents need to be prepared for life itself with each uh, of ethnic groups um, depending on what they're adopting from so that they can prepare the child as well as they're, they're growing up, not just so much of being uh, Caucasian or American, but whatever the child's ethnicity is. They need to be prepared for the embattlements that are to come. 

00:49:00
MICHELLE I was very proud in kindergarten or first grade when we had sharing time, and my mother marched into the school after the teacher says that I need to take home Malcolm X, the book, and bring back Dr. King cuz he was a good Black person. And my mother was like, "You know nothing about, clearly you haven't read Malcolm X, and even if you had an issue with this, my child brought this to playtime. You had already given us a criteria as parents about what can and cannot be brought. I am an educator myself, and my husband has a doctorate. So clearly we understood the guidelines and you should have trusted our judgment. But clearly there's another issue here." You know, so I was very proud to come back the very next day, with Malcolm X, and read Malcolm X and know that my mommy had made that happen. 

00:49:40
JOHN There's a price to be paid. We're dealing with this for the rest of our lives. Trying to make sense of it. And one of the ways we make sense of it is by talking about it publically and trying to help other families so that they can avoid some of the pitfalls and pain that we went through. But that's not always appreciated. Not only by people in our extended families, but by some, like I like to think of mature families and immature families. Like, the immature families are just starting out, they're idealistic, they think love is colorblind, we're gonna conquer this, this is great. Just give me the kid. Then the mature families are the ones where the kids have gone through their adolescence and maybe left home, and the families can all kinda go, "Yep, there was some issues we didn't know what we were getting into, and, and it's very different talking to audiences like that." 

00:50:20
JOHN And I appreciate the approach when adoptive families are able to make room at the table for the whole family, not just the adoptee that they took in, but to, to embrace the family like, yeah, this, so the, the people who are doing open adoptions, either domestically or internationally, I, I think are really to be commended and applauded. That, I think that's a positive direction that we're moving in, that um, we're, we're ex-, we're expanding our family to include, not just the kid, but their extended family. And that's a way around the closed records issue, you know, if it's an open adoption, that's the way to go. We don't have to deal with the state and their stupid regulations and, in any policies and fee schedules and this and that. That just outrages me too. That we don't have to do that. We can, and the other benefit in terms of race and culture is that if you are embracing the whole family, you've got built-in people that look like your child, and you can cultivate those pure relationships that are so important for transracializing your life. 

00:51:20
UNKNOWN FOSTER PARENT 1 We had um, three foster children or siblings and uh, the first time I had to meet Mom, Dad was out of the picture. I had to go to the prison, which for me alone was an experience. And I bring the kids in to meet the mom and immediately I could tell the mom just didn't like me, you know, so I was like, well. We got, this was our first chance to work in foster care, it was our first kids, so um, it was like, well isn't, they taught us in class we gotta build a bond here. 

00:51:50
UNKNOWN FOSTER PARENT 2 I had to convince this lady that I'm not her enemy. I'm here to help her with her child. 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN FOSTER PARENT 3 You've gotta find a common ground, and of course, this is a complete stranger. What is the common ground you have? And it's the child. 

00:52:00
UNKNOWN FOSTER PARENT 4 I can remember this mom was really angry. Her kid had been taken. She was furious, she was suing everyone in the state. And she met me, and she was ready to kill me. And the first thing I said to her was um, "What time does she usually go to bed?" And she looked at me as if I was crazy and, and then she started talking to me as a mom. 

00:52:20
