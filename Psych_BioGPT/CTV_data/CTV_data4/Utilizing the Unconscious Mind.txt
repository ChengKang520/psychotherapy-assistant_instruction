Utilizing the Unconscious Mind 

00:00:30
[sil.] 

00:00:35
Eric Greenleaf, PhD 

00:00:35
ERIC GREENLEAF Okay, thank you for coming out early for this demonstration. And uh… the short introduction is this, Any unconscious mind is not a collection of skeletons in some dusty added to the mind, rather it is he said. Like the great ocean that brought us forth, forward to enmity. Now scratch anybody at this conference and you'll get some uh… appreciation where as since, notion or metaphor if you like the, the nine unconscious minds uh… full of resource, possibilities, surprise, uh… expansion and rest. And you're also familiar with, excuse me, with the, are in retrieving notion of utilization, uh… in Erickson hypnosis and therapy which is if I put it in, in common language terms, How to so relate to a person that you engage them in a wider use of themselves. In, in the old umm… kind of cinematic idea that you take delinquent boys and you teach them to bucks, so that they're not beating up each other in a random way, or you take certain uh… symptoms. And encourage the person to use those very experiences to benefit them rather than to stop them cold. So I, I many years ago started umm… thinking about how to utilize the notion of the unconscious mind. And that's what we're going to do today. Umm… so first thing it's, it's a simple three step deal. First thing I'd like you to do, get comfortable and take a look at your unconscious mind. And in order to do that and you're welcome to hum along with us in, in the audience. To do this you have to get a sense or an intuitive notion of where your own conscious mind is, is it inside you, behind you, all around you, over there. So I'd like you to just get comfortable, close your eyes and take a look at your unconscious mind. The reason for closing your eyes is so that when you see your unconscious mind you can open your eyes as a signal to me that, you've seen it. 

00:04:05
[sil.] 

00:04:10
ERIC GREENLEAF I'm a person who visualizes to use the clumsy term but, if you happen to be differently constructive in your experience, when I say what do you see? It can be what you hear, or feel like a texture or like in a motion, or what moves you. But I say see, so I'd like you to see your unconscious mind, that's right. And when you see it with some clarity then open your eyes. 

00:04:55
[sil.] 

00:05:00
ERIC GREENLEAF Okay. That's good. Yes, okay. And umm… tell me what you saw Paul. 

00:05:10
PAUL Uh… just more of a, of a shape. 

00:05:15
ERIC GREENLEAF Thanks, sorry. More of a shape. 

00:05:20
PAUL Just more of a shape and in front of me kind of coming out of, I guess out of the solar plexus coming up my face. Umm… kind of an oval when, when you said, do you know what do you see, and normally I'm more kinesthetic when I'm… 

00:05:35
ERIC GREENLEAF Sure. 

00:05:35
PAUL But when you said, see then that shape kind of emerged forming a kind of an oval shape, didn't have colors or anything just more of a presence. 

00:05:40
ERIC GREENLEAF And how do you feel toward the oval presence? 

00:05:45
PAUL Well, I love it. 

00:05:45
ERIC GREENLEAF You love it? 

00:05:50
PAUL Yeah, yeah that's sort about the oval. Uh… if it was a square or a triangle, it'd have edges. And edge, you know, to me it means that there's an ending, and in oval, it's continuous. 

00:06:05
ERIC GREENLEAF It's continuous very nice, and uh… if you were to palpated to touch it, has it got a texture? 

00:06:15
[sil.] 

00:06:25
PAUL Uh… when I, when I go into that it's, it's more of a umm… temperature wise it has a, has a warm almost like umm… touching warm wall. 

00:06:35
ERIC GREENLEAF Like warm wall, and is it static or in motion? 

00:06:45
PAUL Has a vibratory nature to it, that's… 

00:06:45
ERIC GREENLEAF I'm sorry. 

00:06:45
PAUL It has a vibratory nature, it's like a, it's a… 

00:06:50
ERIC GREENLEAF A vibratory nature. 

00:06:50
PAUL Yeah, but not, not erratic, just kind of pulsating. 

00:06:55
ERIC GREENLEAF Okay, so it's a pulsating wool warm oval that comes from the solar plexus up around the face. 

00:07:05
PAUL Yes sir. 

00:07:05
ERIC GREENLEAF Suzanne what did you see? 

00:07:10
SUZANNE Umm… I saw a sort of a red, sort of ball like, sort of that side of the corner which should have had really weird. 

00:07:15
ERIC GREENLEAF Which what? 

00:07:15
SUZANNE It felt really weird, does it have, because I was sort of you, when you post the question, I was sort of thinking oh crikey, what, but then suddenly there's this ball sort of like, almost like a sun… 

00:07:30
ERIC GREENLEAF Over in the corner. 

00:07:30
SUZANNE Appeared in the corner. 

00:07:30
ERIC GREENLEAF And beside it being weird how do you feel emotionally toward that red ball in the corner? 

00:07:35
SUZANNE It was surprisingly comforting. 

00:07:40
ERIC GREENLEAF Yeah, it's surprisingly comforting, a red ball in the corner. Juana? 

00:07:50
JUANA Umm… for me I had never, I have never done anything like this, so it, I felt like a struggle between my head and here in my abdomen. So finally I felt that more in my abdomen and what I saw as I searched was the peak openness of the ocean. 

00:08:15
ERIC GREENLEAF The big openness of the ocean and, and what is your emotion looking at that big openness of the ocean? 

00:08:20
JUANA Uh… calmness. 

00:08:25
ERIC GREENLEAF Calmness, do you like that emotion? 

00:08:25
JUANA Yes. 

00:08:30
ERIC GREENLEAF And is it pervasive, does it, is it all through your body? 

00:08:35
JUANA I would say yes. 

00:08:40
ERIC GREENLEAF Yeah, so a pervasive calm feeling from the inside and opening up. So it's radiating. Angela. 

00:08:55
ANGELA Umm… I saw the river, the water, actually it's the Yangtze river in China, it's the longest river and naturally all the water are connected, so I saw the Yangtze river when I had that uh… feeling and imagination that river is connected with ocean in all of the world. 

00:09:25
ERIC GREENLEAF And how does that suit you emotionally, that the Yangtze flowing to the sea. 

00:09:30
ANGELA It is the connection. 

00:09:30
ERIC GREENLEAF And, and is it inside you or out. 

00:09:35
ANGELA It is inside, it's right here. 

00:09:35
ERIC GREENLEAF There? 

00:09:35
ANGELA Yeah, right here. 

00:09:40
ERIC GREENLEAF Yeah, so the Yangtze flowing to the sea, in, in here, the red ball out there, the oval coming up, yeah Brendan. 

00:09:55
BRENDAN Uh… I had an image right away of a colorful dragon. 

00:10:00
ERIC GREENLEAF Oh. 

00:10:05
BRENDAN That was inside me, that was filling up my body in a way. Umm… and it reminded me of a puppet that I got a dragon puppet for a friend of mine. So there was a sense of playfulness and, and a lot of colors, but then also this dragon there. And then some feeling around it of, of water and sort of deep colors. 

00:10:25
ERIC GREENLEAF And, and so it fills the interior of you. 

00:10:25
BRENDAN Yeah. 

00:10:30
ERIC GREENLEAF And how do you feel towards it emotionally. 

00:10:35
BRENDAN Umm… a couple of things, I, I felt, well, I thought curious and then I felt uh… as I felt sort of happy but then in an edge of, of something I don't know, I mean my mind was thinking like oasis of angers or something strange sort of analyze it. But I felt… 

00:10:50
ERIC GREENLEAF Something. 

00:10:55
BRENDAN Something and yeah, happiness combined with something else, maybe some, some sort of edge hard to describe. 

00:11:00
ERIC GREENLEAF How mobilous(ph) or still is the dragon? 

00:11:10
BRENDAN The, the image was still but there was a sense that it was playful that it could move. 

00:11:15
ERIC GREENLEAF Huh, right. And, and umm… what color? 

00:11:20
BRENDAN Blue. And, and, yeah, most of it was blue and then the other colors, umm… some red, some black, some green, but the, the body was blue. 

00:11:30
ERIC GREENLEAF And, and is it's head inside your head and it's, where are the wings? 

00:11:35
BRENDAN They were also inside of me. It was sort of as if it fit from my head to my feet, but in its way inside of me. 

00:11:45
ERIC GREENLEAF So playful blue dragon from the head to the feet inside. Karn? 

00:11:50
KAREN I just had an incredible warmth all through my body and then, surrounding my body and then beyond. A warmth that brought real calmness and, and a lot of heat. 

00:12:00
ERIC GREENLEAF So an incredible warmth all through the body and beyond. So first thing to notice about this and, and it would be confirmed if we had time for everyone to speak. Everybody's unconscious mind is highly individual, highly individual. The location can be inside or all over the place uh… so six people entirely different. That's the first part of this exercise you feel like. But since I don't like exercising and would rather call it something else I'm not sure what. Okay, so that would be the first step, what does your unconscious mind look like and in the manner of people who do hypnosis. I, I am generally uh… indicating that one should umm… connect with the image if you like in emotional ways, intellectual ways, visual ways, kinesthetic ways and all kinds of other ways. Because it, it tends to expand the sense of experience. You'll also notice if everyone who do this stuff clinically that umm… I, I am not very interested in problematic statements, so I, I tend to step around them. Like well, I had a funny feeling, I wasn't quite sure what it was. 

00:13:55
[sil.] 

00:14:00
ERIC GREENLEAF The uh… all will be made clear would be the, kind of dumb version of what I'm trying to do so. Okay, second thing I, I like very much the notion of insoluble problems, 

00:14:15
[sil.] 

00:14:20
ERIC GREENLEAF Umm… Erickson has a wonderful thing that he said, he said, "You go to a doctor and he tries to kind of pass you off with some kind of thing that won't work." But he said if you, you go to a doctor who says. Well, I don't really know what to do here, but this, this really deserves care. And then he says, and this is the quote I like, and you find yourself in the hands of someone who will make a penetrating research into an insoluble problem. A penetrating research, so this is our penetrating research, into an insoluble problem, it's kind of an homage to doctor Erickson. Umm… so, happily I don't need to know what the problem is, but I do need to know what it looks like. So I'd like you to again get comfortable, close your eyes so that you can signal me when you've seen this thing. 

00:15:35
[sil.] 

00:15:40
ERIC GREENLEAF As though you were having a dream of the problem. 

00:15:45
[sil.] 

00:15:50
ERIC GREENLEAF And, and because hypnosis is analogized so often to sleep in one version of hypnosis from the 19th century, where people noticed that uh… hypnotized subjects would kind of move like that. But in another nineteenth century version of the theory of hypnosis umm… produced by these English physicians, Carpenter and Laylock. 

00:16:20
[sil.] 

00:16:25
ERIC GREENLEAF The, the Hypnotized person was seemed to be thinking problem solving and having a kind of alternate and expanded personality or a ability. And it's that latter view of hypnosis that I, I think is the more palpable interesting and useful. Although everybody thinks it's like sleep because of the name hypnosis. Umm… in the Temple of a (inaudible ) slope of the Parthenon, there is a temple with two statues, one Hypnos, the god of sleep and the other Oneiros the God of dreams. And people who had impossible physical and emotional problems would come to that temple. And I want you to see it real clearly, the problem as a dream. And they were taken, there they were cleansed and so forth and then taken to a little room of, beneath the main floor of the temple where they were put to sleep. And they would stay there and sleep and dream until they had a dream of the God Asclepius coming to heal them or some other dream of resolution of their problems. So umm… and then they would awaken from the sleep, tell the priests their dream. Priest would write it on a piece of pottery, they pay a fee and go home, psychotherapy. So take a look at the problem when you see it clearly just umm… Open your eyes to let me know. That's right. 

00:18:35
[sil.] 

00:18:50
ERIC GREENLEAF Okay, so uh… Karen, now I don't want if you can restrain yourselves from talking about the problem. I just want to know what it looks like. I want the picture of it, because it's easier for me to work that way, yeah. 

00:19:10
KAREN So mine was the color green umm… just lots and lots of green and then black almost like webs of black, umm…throughout and then the shining light. 

00:19:25
ERIC GREENLEAF Okay, so green, a field of color, black webs and the shining light. How, how do feel towards that emotionally, that problem. 

00:19:35
KAREN Umm… probably that it's certainly umm… solvable and quite small. 

00:19:40
ERIC GREENLEAF Solvable and quite small though insoluble and, and large. 

00:19:50
KAREN Well, I think that the umm… I didn't see the green as being the problem. I saw the black. 

00:19:55
ERIC GREENLEAF The black was, okay. Brendan? 

00:20:00
BRENDAN Uh… the image I had was of me inside of a living room with people around but being alone in the center. 

00:20:10
ERIC GREENLEAF So alone in the center of the living room with people around. Angel?(ph) 

00:20:15
ANGELA Umm… it is like I, I always playing along the river. I love that to go swimming but I am not good swimmer, I am very hesitating, I was, I just saw a native girl, over there I tried to taste the water but then come back. 

00:20:40
ERIC GREENLEAF So a girl trying to test the water but pulling back from it, it with the caution and fear. Yeah Juana. 

00:20:50
JUANA I was in an open space, there was no grass, it was just so, it like dry, dry soil, and there was this huge bag that was around my neck. 

00:21:05
ERIC GREENLEAF A huge bag? 

00:21:10
JUANA Bag, and the weight of it was in the bag as I was trying to move forward I could feel the weight of this bag just pulling me as I moved forward, just a sense of like choky. 

00:21:30
ERIC GREENLEAF Yeah, so a bag that's pulling back around your neck with a heavy uh… burden behind it. And if you strain to go forward it, it kind of chokes you. Suzanne? 

00:21:45
SUZANNE Umm… I had the cemetery inside me. I'm not sure the English sort of word for it, it sort of these umm… like, like, you know, the sea, sea sort of sea creatures but they have sort of thorns, this is… 

00:22:00
ERIC GREENLEAF They have! 

00:22:00
SUZANNE Sort of like thorns all over and I don't know… 

00:22:00
ERIC GREENLEAF Oh, yeah, yeah. 

00:22:05
SUZANNE What would you call them? 

00:22:05
ERIC GREENLEAF Urchins, that they are spikey, little things. 

00:22:10
SUZANNE Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, little, little things and I have the sort of, as if it was here in my tummy and then I sort of was thinking how, how do I get rid of it. And the idea I was sort of thinking, all right… it could just, you know, go out of my mouth, but I don't like the idea of throwing up. So I was thinking, and I, I could sort of notice I was thinking and sort of and I was thinking no I don't want to throw up. And then suddenly I had the sensation of that I am, you know, as if somebody sort of chokes me and then sort of it occurred to me, you can just breathe it out. And sort of I was breathing out and it sort of was all right. 

00:22:40
ERIC GREENLEAF Mm-hm. Yeah, Paul. 

00:22:45
PAUL Umm… the image came of the classic pirate treasure chest. And uh… I pull up my rib cage with chains all round it, and chains pulling it in all kinds of direction so that it was so stabilize that it couldn't move. 

00:23:05
ERIC GREENLEAF So an immobile treasure chest with chains, sea urchins in the stomach uh… that are spiky and, and nauseating. Uh… black webs, you know, approximating fairly in enough nightmarish possibilities, a, a burdensome choking chain of umm… rope around the neck and uh… of all those things. So that's the second step so, what does your unconscious mind look like, what is the difficult or insoluble, I prefer bigger problems, but it's okay. What does the insoluble problem look like, insoluble problem I should say would be, would be characterized by umm… everybody's smart, experienced in life, you think and, and strategize and, consult and, feel and, process and imagine. And you can't come up with anything that will resolve the problem without causing worse trouble, or which requires cooperation from uncooperative people and you're stuck, and then in psychotherapy there's this notion that if you keep working the problem, you will then come to some resolution. You'll forgive the kind of sarcastic sound of what I'm about to say but, only in psychotherapy among all human endeavors is, is the description of the problem thought to be the solution of the problem. This is not true in plumy aviation or auto mechanics art, music or any other human activity. But used to be the case prominently in, in uh… psychotherapy as, as commonly practice. You will note that in intimate relations where you reveal difficult problems to people you trust. Although you feel some relief sharing the problem, they are still unresolved. 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:50
ERIC GREENLEAF And then if, if you go to a modern therapist who is not doing CBT or some programmatic uh, approach who hasn't individualized psychotherapy, 

00:26:00
[sil.] 

00:26:05
ERIC GREENLEAF You will want them to make that searching inquiry into an insoluble problem, so now the therapeutic part of this. The third thing I'd like you to do, take the dream of the problem, the chest, the spiky balls, the little girl by the river and so on. Take the problem and put it into your unconscious mind. Now if the problem is bigger in some aspect in your unconscious mind, put it as, as close to your unconscious mind as you can. Breathe out slowly, because you'd like this to umm… 

00:27:05
[sil.] 

00:27:10
ERIC GREENLEAF Be umm… on a bed of uh… as ease full of bodily experiences you can have. So you're gonna breathe out slowly, put the problem into your unconscious mind and see what happens, see what you notice and then when you notice something. Just open your eyes to let me know. 

00:27:45
[sil.] 

00:27:55
ERIC GREENLEAF Oh, I was, I was starting to say if, if you went to a therapist who umm… thinks of you as an individual rather than the category. You know, a person who's jumpy or excited rather than in another example of anxiety, disorder, 509.3 or something, then you can easily see how this simple looking around in your unconscious mind or towards your unconscious mind. It gives you a highly individualized picture of the person without taking the history. You do see no symptom pattern, or any of the other things we were all taught to do on a kind of primitive medical model of human interaction. Where the therapist is expert the poor patient is troubled and we can categorize, treat, and dismiss that person sometimes without ever getting to know them as, as unique individuals. The, the sort of means of knowing the person as an individual, are, are fairly straightforward. Gaze at their face and posture approvingly and interestedly, hear some, some of some of their story, especially the part of the story where they tell you what they love to do, or are good at. And then apply what you're learning about them as an individual to uh… their goals. So let's see very good. And breathe, always good to breathe. Hard to Breathe in this hotel atmosphere but, it's like being in an airplane for days, the dry air circulates and everybody has stuff under their eyes. But the people, people are so interesting. So voluminous in their emotions, concepts, decisions and actions, it's really quite nice if you like people. So, Paul what did you notice? Umm… yeah, thanks. 

00:31:10
PAUL All right, so I had the uh… the locked chest with chains around and uh… when I, when I move that, pardon me, when I moved that up into the unconscious I had the oval unconscious. 

00:31:25
ERIC GREENLEAF Oh, you moved it up here where the oval was coming at your face, oh yeah. 

00:31:30
PAUL Uh… the chains came off, it's still locked, but as it was still locked in the back of my head I remember this all the lyrics of this old blues song, that was "Oh my Lord, bless my soul I got the right key but the wrong key hole. But it's nice to have the chains off. 

00:31:55
ERIC GREENLEAF Yeah, did, did you try lifting the lid. 

00:32:00
PAUL It was locked still, I, I did try, but now I'm wondering if, if that's my chest, it might not be. 

00:32:10
ERIC GREENLEAF That's very intriguing I like that. Umm… how would you decide? 

00:32:15
PAUL I don't know. It's just a, I have a feeling I'll know, that's all I can say. 

00:32:25
ERIC GREENLEAF That I think that's, that's adequate to the case as they say umm… I have a feeling umm… no. And so if you should know why we're all chatting, let us know okay. 

00:32:40
PAUL I'll let you know when I know, yes. 

00:32:45
ERIC GREENLEAF Well, well, I like that the chains came off, that feel how does that feel emotionally. 

00:32:45
PAUL It's a lot lighter. 

00:32:50
ERIC GREENLEAF It's a lot lighter, yeah. It's a lot lighter and hard to characterize what you said another word, so we'll leave it like that, you feel you know. Susan, Suzanne I'm sorry. 

00:33:10
SUZANNE No it is actually Suzanne. 

00:33:10
ERIC GREENLEAF It is? 

00:33:10
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:33:15
ERIC GREENLEAF Oh, then I retract my apology. So, what did you see? 

00:33:20
SUZANNE Uh… I could see sort of the uh… this sort of these, these, these creatures soften them a little bit but uh… still, still, that felt better but at the same time I could sort of have a real sort of sense of suffocation and I was trying to breathe when you, when you sort of said breathe in. But it's sort of it's, it's really sitting here and I was sort of thinking how interesting. I mean interesting, It's, it's not comfortable but I was sort of thinking for the first time it occurred to me, how, you know when you sort of say how problems would manifest in the body. I was sort of interesting from that point of view, I hadn't been aware of that, yeah and remind us again of what your unconscious mind is like. 

00:34:00
SUZANNE Uh… It's, it's sort of this red ball which is sort of having light. 

00:34:10
ERIC GREENLEAF And is it warm? 

00:34:10
SUZANNE It is but it doesn't reach here, that's the funny thing. 

00:34:15
ERIC GREENLEAF No, no, no but it is warm. 

00:34:15
SUZANNE Yeah. 

00:34:20
ERIC GREENLEAF Is it warm enough to boil water? 

00:34:25
SUZANNE I, I beg your pardon. 

00:34:25
ERIC GREENLEAF Is it, is the red ball warm enough to boil water. 

00:34:30
SUZANNE Yes. 

00:34:35
ERIC GREENLEAF Okay, so suppose you take the urchins which is what they are called, and put it into the boiling red pot and see what happens. 

00:34:50
[sil.] 

00:35:00
SUZANNE It's sort of, It's almost like, it's sort of sufferance, it sort of disintegrate, disintegrate is the wrong word, it's sort of just disappears, it sort of become sort of one what, what was it. 

00:35:20
ERIC GREENLEAF Yeah and how do you feel emotionally towards that change? 

00:35:25
SUZANNE Umm… quite moved. 

00:35:25
ERIC GREENLEAF Quite moved, yeah. 

00:35:30
[sil.] 

00:35:35
ERIC GREENLEAF Have you ever eaten sea urchin, have you ever eaten that, a, a Sea urchin. You don't eat the spines, they, they cut them open and you sip the liquor. 

00:35:50
SUZANNE I, I might have, I have eaten lots and lots of seafood, might have. 

00:35:50
ERIC GREENLEAF Yeah, yeah, but, but it's moving when it softens, yes? Good. Juana. 

00:36:00
JUANA I am… 

00:36:05
ERIC GREENLEAF And you can, oh, I'm sorry, forgive me but, the questions I like in this kind of work are what do you notice and also sometimes uh… anything difficult or interesting that occurred, because novelty is very good for psychotherapy as in life. And one's own sense of his or her unconscious mind being active and interactive, is very compelling. 

00:36:55
[sil.] 

00:37:00
ERIC GREENLEAF And again, to point out the obvious I am not discussing problems I don't even know what they are. But I am, I am happy to offer pragmatic suggestions. Because the umm… the dream image if you interact with it pragmatically gives you a lot opportunity to experiment. So you have a warm red thing over there and spiky living creatures here, boil them up see what happens. And it's emotionally effective. 

00:37:45
[sil.] 

00:37:50
ERIC GREENLEAF But nobody knows how. Yes, please I am sorry. 

00:37:55
JUANA Um… I found myself going to the ocean. 

00:37:55
ERIC GREENLEAF Yeah. 

00:38:00
JUANA And placing this heavy bag by the shore and watching the waves but at the beginning the weight was so much that the ocean could not carry it away. 

00:38:15
ERIC GREENLEAF Yes. 

00:38:15
JUANA But little by little it was like the, the weight would sink deep and then the ocean was taking it away and I stood there watching it. Just being removed and taken into the big, big ocean. 

00:38:35
ERIC GREENLEAF And how was that for your feelings. 

00:38:40
JUANA Umm… lightness. 

00:38:40
ERIC GREENLEAF Yes. 

00:38:45
JUANA And, just being able to let go. 

00:38:50
ERIC GREENLEAF Yeah, it's lightness and being able to let go. Is it a feeling of relief or a different feeling. 

00:39:00
JUANA Umm… It's a mix bag. It was a mixed bag, yeah. Because we never knew what was in that bag. 

00:39:10
JUANA Yeah, but it's, it's a feeling of sadness and at the same time, it's a feeling of being freed from the weight. 

00:39:25
ERIC GREENLEAF Yes. Just again to say the obvious, the, the emotional response to change is highly sophisticated and precise. And it's very, again very difficult to put into words without writing the play, or novel, or painting a picture, or making music, or dance, because there are a lot of dimensions to motional expression. Umm… and that's why there are these cottage industries within psychotherapy of art therapy, music therapy, dance therapy, energy therapies, also somatic emphasis as, as a, an attempt to find a vocabulary of expression for sophisticated human emotional, and inter personal experience. Angela? 

00:40:20
ANGELA Umm… it is like a dream while I, that girl was uh… playing along the river and there came a fish boat and umm… the fishermen offered her, do you want to get into the water. And um, she said yes, and then the fisherman said you can come onto the boat, I can take you to whichever part of the water you want to be. So the girl got on the boat and the fisherman said, You can sit at the end of the boat and dip your feet into the water. So she did and she felt the warmth of the water. 

00:41:15
ERIC GREENLEAF And how did you feel seeing the girl get her feet wet. 

00:41:20
ANGELA Umm… I can see that she is more assured and she is more comforted. 

00:41:30
ERIC GREENLEAF And, and you're pleased with that, do you like that? 

00:41:35
ANGELA Yeah. 

00:41:35
ERIC GREENLEAF Yeah, she's more assured, more confident and also obviously going at her own pace. 

00:41:40
ANGELA Mm-hm. 

00:41:45
ERIC GREENLEAF No one tossed her in. She wasn't obliged to hold back she could, dangle and splash in the water, which is the way everyone gets used to water. Dangling and splashing. Brendan? 

00:42:05
BRENDAN I saw well, so this dragon umm… was swallowed this living room which was the people and me in the middle, umm… but we're alone. And I went deep into the dragon's belly and the dragon had been static, but, but flexible and had been sort of still, but almost like this puppet that I gotten for this friend. It was sort of soft and staying there. So when it went to the belly the dragon became much more alive and seemed to, to also embody more of me, like before it was just sort of fitting inside of me in its own shape, but it sort of filled to my fingers and the rest of me and breathed fire. And, umm… and then the, the room, the living room was spinning around in its belly, it is deep in its belly. Umm… and the structure's still there of the living room, and I'm not sure what was happening with the people inside of it, and then I felt a umm… more of a sense of balance and, and the image of the dragon faded some and even us. And then the, the room picture going to my heart and some sadness there um, not in, not intense sadness but a little sadness there and then this kind of sense of evenness. 

00:43:25
ERIC GREENLEAF So a sense of sadness, evenness and the living room moves up around the heart. Is the living room any more livable? Can you live there easily. 

00:43:40
BRENDAN It, it felt more dynamic. 

00:43:45
ERIC GREENLEAF Yes. 

00:43:45
BRENDAN And more, I think more interaction in the living room. So yeah, I would, I would say more livable. 

00:43:55
ERIC GREENLEAF And, and how do you like the fiery expressiveness. 

00:43:55
BRENDAN I like it. It felt alive. 

00:43:55
ERIC GREENLEAF In that quote? 

00:43:55
BRENDAN Yeah. 

00:44:00
ERIC GREENLEAF Dragons should always have a… And if you do this with several people at once or a are group. If that red ball in the corner hadn't been heatable to boil water, you could put the urchins into the, into a pot with water and put the dragons fiery breath on it. So you can use another person's unconscious mind. In the same way you would use your own, but not as a, an intimate discussing your troubles or sharing your sorrows, although that's very powerful and important. But rather as a, the way you ask a friend who's a lawyer what the hell should I do with this lawsuit thing. You get expert advice that way. You know if I want to draw something ask my wife because she's an artist, I'm not going to labor over the thing, I'll say you draw this card for our grandson or something. So she does it and take her a minute. That dragon is a great thing because it's got the fiery breath and it's in a different proportion, in him or with him so that you get more movement in living. More room in living. And less isolation within one's own life, so these, these um, I don't know what to call them these expressions can be very um, evocative of change going forward, that's why it's always nice to ask people to keep track of these things. See what happens next. A Jungian guy's name I don't remember said with the unconscious you have to wait to see what happens next and you know in, in notice also, in hypnotic work how things slow down. And even valuable people like myself doing therapy will wait ten minutes quietly while something that happens or even longer. And the feeling is always of something about to happen as, as several people have expressed here, something about to happen we don't know what, is a very alluring possibility. Yes, Karen. 

00:47:10
KAREN Yes, hi, I just saw a glass, a crystal glass filled with water and, and I thought I was listening to everyone else and just taking more time that all of sudden the glass started to pour out. And I saw beautiful plant, that was very crystal clear and I could look into it and see really clear reflection of myself. 

00:47:30
ERIC GREENLEAF And when you looked at the reflection unlike Narcissus, but like people everywhere look in the glass, what did you see. 

00:47:40
KAREN Just again some warmth but, clarity, real strong sense of clarity. 

00:47:45
ERIC GREENLEAF Do you like that? 

00:47:50
KAREN Mm-hm. 

00:47:50
ERIC GREENLEAF I, I like to ask if you like the thing that, that because of one incident from long ago I, I was doing a, a hypnosis group in the VA and uh… I had this clever exercise uh… where you would drink, umm… you'd imagine in trance, drinking special milk from a special red carton and it had no bad side effects and only good main effects, and was kind of aimed at people who are addicted to see if, because you could have as much as you want. In the way uh, Bedell(ph) home used to lead people in the orthongenic school. Kids have milk and bread and butter any time they wanted it. So I was thinking of that, so I do this thing and a guy comes up to me afterwards and says, "hey, what, what are you doing? Giving us that milk stuff, "you know I'm allergic to milk," which I hadn't known but so ever after I always said, so this is how I felt blissful and then I said do you like that feeling. Because sometimes people don't, it's rare but there are people for example, who like excitement more than they like static calm, you know, you're now going deeper into a trance kind of thing, they might like rather to be uh… excited and curious and adventurous, like the guy with the pirate chest might like. So um, here's another thing because we have a little time. Among these unconscious minds where would you put the chest to, to uh… encourage that sense of something happening that you'll know when you feel it. Do any of them appeal to you or they. 

00:49:55
[sil.] 

00:50:10
PAUL I just get the sensation I need to leave it where it is, up here in my oval of unconscious. 

00:50:15
ERIC GREENLEAF Okay. 

00:50:15
PAUL And not, out of the feeling of not rushing, I tend to be a Type A personality and I guess it wants me to not rush. 

00:50:25
ERIC GREENLEAF You have such a beguiling slow manner of speech but I, I believe you. 

00:50:30
PAUL Well, that's being from South Carolina. 

00:50:35
ERIC GREENLEAF South Carolina helps but inside your raging ball. 

00:50:40
PAUL Yeah, but it just, it feel, actually feels comfortable. 

00:50:40
ERIC GREENLEAF To leave this. 

00:50:40
PAUL For now. 

00:50:40
ERIC GREENLEAF Okay, fair enough, yeah. 

00:50:40
PAUL Yes, thank you. 

00:50:45
ERIC GREENLEAF Uh… questions, comments. Yeah, please. Um, hang on for the. For the microphone, yeah. 

00:51:00
UNKNOWN When you lead someone into this visualization of their unconscious mind. 

00:51:05
ERIC GREENLEAF Yeah. 

00:51:05
UNKNOWN Do you ever get resistance and say I'm not seeing anything or, or the same with the problem, well they probably can visualize the problem but what do you do if you have someone that doesn't seem to be able to see anything. 

00:51:25
ERIC GREENLEAF I, it's, it's a lovely question because I, I don't encounter resistance. Yeah, so go ahead tell me you don't see anything. 

00:51:35
UNKNOWN Well, I did see something. 

00:51:40
ERIC GREENLEAF No, no, no, I mean as though, as though one of these recalcitrant people who somehow don't satisfy the therapist opportunity to shine. What? So go ahead, tell me, say what do you see and you say nothing or what? 

00:52:00
UNKNOWN Okay, so I'm the person that doesn't see anything. 

00:52:00
ERIC GREENLEAF There you go. 

00:52:05
UNKNOWN So um, you know, I don't understand what you mean about unconscious mind. And uh… what am I supposed to be seeing, and umm… I don't know, I guess I don't visualize something. So they might say that. 

00:52:20
ERIC GREENLEAF True that, you don't visualize something. 

00:52:25
[sil.] 

00:52:30
ERIC GREENLEAF And what do you sense in that nothingness? 

00:52:35
UNKNOWN Hmm… that's good. 

00:52:40
ERIC GREENLEAF Is it, is it a warm nothingness or cool nothingness. 

00:52:45
UNKNOWN Okay, umm… 

00:52:45
ERIC GREENLEAF See, with dissociated people if you're doing hypnosis, you want to encourage dissociations not rocket science, say well, I don't, I don't know, I, I, I don't seem to have any sensation in my hands and, and you can always say well, which is warmer, the palm or the back. It's helping kids eat their vegetables. Do you want the carrots or the green beans, or would you like that with the broccoli or without. The illusion of choice I think it's called, So, yes, a warm or cold nothingness. 

00:53:30
UNKNOWN More probably cold this morning. 

00:53:30
ERIC GREENLEAF Probably cold this morning as we all are in this chilling atmosphere. And, uh… is it big or small nothingness. 

00:53:40
[sil.] 

00:53:45
UNKNOWN Probably very big. 

00:53:45
ERIC GREENLEAF Probably very big and what's the probability of it being very, very big. 

00:53:55
UNKNOWN That it's everywhere present. 

00:53:55
ERIC GREENLEAF And if it's possible to say, since it's highly probably very big. 

00:54:05
[sil.] 

00:54:10
ERIC GREENLEAF Do you have an emotional feeling about that. 

00:54:15
UNKNOWN Hmm… Personally yes, it's very expansive, probably pretty wise. 

00:54:25
ERIC GREENLEAF Probably pretty wise. And what's the probability of it being pretty wise. 

00:54:35
UNKNOWN Probably being 90%. 

00:54:40
ERIC GREENLEAF Much higher than the probability discovered in psychological experiments. So this, this, uh, those of you know statistics will be pleased to know that she's just covered 80% of the variance. uh, that wont get you the Nobel Prize in psychology if they had one. So, thank you for doing that. 

00:55:05
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:55:10
ERIC GREENLEAF It doesn't matter what the image is at all, just that you can discuss it, respond to it. If I put a series of counters on the table I could ask you what are your emotions looking at these pieces of clay or, you know, if you imagine touching them, do you, do you think they'd be warm or cold. Uh… if I threw them at the wall like spaghetti with a stick, think about being a little child, and how you explore and discover the world. You poke, you pull, you drop it in water, you roll it down the thing, you make a game out of it. Doctor Erickson said among the many nice things he said when you have a difficult problem make an interesting pattern out of it. And I would say when you have an insoluble problem. Hands off put it in your unconscious mind, you can't do any worse you might do better. It's a universal solvent, the unconscious mind. And because it's got all the time in the world you can just leave it there, so it's like a bank account or something used to be when there were interest payments, or safe deposit bucks if you can get one and you can leave stuff in. And uh… conditions will change. You know, uh… with time for a couple or more questions or comments if anyone would like to ask or say, yeah. Hang on a second for, are very able. 

00:57:30
UNKNOWN Thank you, I felt when you had an image you're interested in where it landed going up or down, was there significance in that on the um, where you're putting it up versus putting it down, on the… 

00:57:45
ERIC GREENLEAF No, no significance whatsoever, it is syncratic. Do you like wearing your, your scarf loose on your neck or tied around, with a sweater, or do you want to put the sweater around your waist, or leave it in your pocketbook, but also you say put it and that's, that's uh… mistaken. 

00:58:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:58:10
ERIC GREENLEAF One doesn't put it, one sees it where it is. 

00:58:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:58:15
ERIC GREENLEAF If you put it somewhere it's not the same sort of thing, what you put is the problem but you don't put the unconscious if that makes a distinction that bears a difference or difference with distinction. Yeah, the Hallmark of unconsciousness in a positive sense is that you find yourself doing something and it's very similar to what happens if you uh… use sort of old fashioned hypnosis where you make a post hypnotic suggestion with the suggestion of amnesia blah, blah, blah. And then you, you as the hypnotic subject find yourself doing something hopefully positive, you know, I found myself for any letter to my old friend, I found myself walking into a shop and noticing all the bright colors. Think about all again, all the kind of tropes Dr. Erickson used where he'd have people go out and look at grass to see all the different colors. They, their little exercises to expand possibility and, and I have attempted to exaggerate that kind of idea to say, well, suppose you had a really bad problem and you only have your own odd unconscious mind now what? And, and hopefully you can see now what, there's a movement of some kind and when you have movement in therapy generally people are happy, when you have no movement generally people are unhappy, especially those paying the bill, yes, please. Uh… the mic's around and is coming to you at speed and this will at last be our last question because we're brides to leave on time. 

01:00:35
UNKNOWN I just want to comment that it seems like there was a sub-story going on, I thought if I can articulate this the way I really want to but, it, the, the induction was really multilevel and very, very much more complex than it appeared. And in your indirect way of eliciting a, a very warm and safe relationship with some, it totally implied with a subconscious mind. They all began to have a relationship with a part of themselves that they previously hadn't even defined. And then, you know, through those that deliberate sequence, there's this merging with and in each case there's a surrender, so, umm… I think there's a lot of psycho education going on simultaneously, just want to share that observation. 

01:01:25
ERIC GREENLEAF Thank you uh… that's a better summary than I could have done. And, and very, very intelligent one too so thank you all for coming in and we'll see you around.
