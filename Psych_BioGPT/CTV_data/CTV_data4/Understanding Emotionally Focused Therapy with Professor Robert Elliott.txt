Introduction 

00:00:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, I'm pleased to be able to have an opportunity to talk about uh… this session, umm… that we had with the client. Umm… and I'm gonna first talk about some of the umm… some of the background umm… in terms of my experience going into the session, umm… I did not know uh… anything about this client ah… and so ah… as always when I meet a new client, I was uh, full of sort of anticipation and excitement and very much looking forward to, to entering another, a new person's world. Umm… but, as he and I sat in the room while the camera people umm… worked on getting everything right umm… he and I begin to feel, I think a bit more anxious umm… and it was something about the uh… umm… I'm talking about this because it ends up affecting my experience in the session. But, there is something about the attention to detail that umm… the crew was engaged in that I think caught both the client and I uh… engage the part of us that, I maybe want to be helpful to them. Umm… so I carried into the session a bit of distraction about that umm… and I found myself at times forgetting umm… bits of his story which I don't normally do. So the couple, there is a couple of places in this session where I've forgotten, you know, who the person that he's skived off school with was. It wasn't his brother, it was his friend. Umm… and that's because at various times in the session, a part of my attention was sort of somewhat elsewhere. This is not something that umm… this is something I, I umm… strive to avoid in my work with clients generally and in fact the thing that I loved most about doing therapy umm… is that I can do one thing for an hour, umm… give my complete attention to one, you know, enter another person's world. Uh… so that's sort of what I brought into this, with this session. 

00:02:15
"Tasks" 

00:02:20
ROBERT ELLIOT In EFT, it's very important to uh… pay attention to what the client and the therapist are uh… trying to accomplish in the, in the moment, in the session. Uh… we call these tasks, these are the particular uh… pieces of work that the client and therapists are trying to do in particular what the client is bringing to the therapist and so whenever I, umm… look at a piece of work or, umm… you know, reflect on my own work I'm always trying to think about what were the things that, that the client in particular umm… but, also myself, what we were trying to work towards and so if I look back at the session, with the client, umm… I think, my, my first task was to connect and to come into an emphatic attunement with the client, to build a relationship to support the work that we're going to be doing. Umm… and then uh… you know, I was looking for what the main piece of work because as I said, I have no idea about umm… what the client was gonna be bringing and so in the early minutes of the session, I'm, as I often do, I'm looking around trying to basically using what I call task empathy, empathy for the client's agency, what the client is bringing. And, umm… it begin to emerge that the client umm… was coming in with, with what we call unfinished business, unresolved, umm… difficult emotions with his father umm… and umm… eventually with a couple of cycles of work on this task, umm… but this was supported by quite a bit of narrative work. This is common in empty chair work. Uh… We had the client talked to the empty chairs, as if it's the other person umm…. So commonly in this kind of work, uh… the client recovers episodic memories that come sort of flooding back into the person's experience and we saw that in the session in several places. Uh… and the client has what we call narrative pressure. There is the story wants to be told and so the client then lays out the story umm… and so that was gonna be going on, But in the first 15 minutes of the session, another possible task emerged and this created a bit of uncertainty for me for a while and this task had to do with his puzzlement over what he called his naughty behavior as a child. The fact that, umm… he had so many, lost so many, uh… conduct points in school and, and basically, I mean, he was characterizing this as naughty or uh… being silly or being the person who attracted sort of negative attention of the family. But, eventually I heard this is a kind of rebellious part of himself. So this part emerged in the first uh… part of the session and it wasn't clear to me for a while whether this was maybe another task he wanted to work on and so that was kind of floating in there. Umm… eventually he came back to the unresolved issues with his father and it became clear that's what this session was going to be about. Uh… and that's how we then proceeded uh… and that work on the unresolved issues with his father was supported by the use of experiential focusing as developed by Gendlin where, I helped him access in his body in several places and look inside to uh… to access and symbolize his emotions. Uh… and towards the end, uh… in the last part of the session, the last episode of the session, he moved into a process of self-soothing where he was umm… first comforting his image of his father and then comforting himself and so that became a kind of emergent end of session task of that, that umm… appeared and helped us to move to a closure in the session. 

00:06:05
"Episodes" 

00:06:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, so as I see it and one of the things I like to do when I look back at sessions is to umm… kind of, uh… organize them or chunk them into what I call episodes and episode is a part of a piece of therapeutic work that's organized around a particular topic or task and as I see it there were four main episodes in this session, uh… that we've, umm… we've seen. Umm… and umm… the first episode was connecting and finding the task, the second episode was the first round of, a first round of empty chair work with his father. Uh… the second, then it was a second round which the third episode was a second round of empty chair work and then, this moved into the fourth episode which is a close, which was closure work, in which we concluded the empty chair work and gradually begin to, uh… back out of the uh… close up the what have been quite a deep process. Now, umm… if I go through, I go through each of the four episodes then, the first episode umm… as I said was connecting and umm… finding the task and the client came in and umm… really on, it appeared that was likely to be unfinished business. Umm… but then a second task emerged around, umm… his sense of having been a problematic child umm… and the person carrying problems. And umm… then he wound his way back to his dad and we, and that concluded the first episode. So that first episode was all about finding the main focus of the session. Umm… then at the end of that episode, he produced a clear marker or sign of readiness for doing empty chair work. Umm… and umm… this marker was, umm… I see if I can find my notes here. Umm… this marker was, umm… something's missing, he said. We never really made contact and that was the marker for the empty chair work, uh… when he came to that, sort of clear statement of his position with his father. Umm… what was unresolved. Uh… so then we entered into the first round of empty chair work, where I had to make contact with his, the image of his father. He then accessed an episodic memory of his father in hospital which he was gonna come back to in the later episodes. Umm… but then in the process of beginning to explore that he had another episodic memory that he accessed and this is a memory of painful contact with his father. So as I understand it, you know, he's thinking about the lack of contact he had with his father in the hospital. He remembered what'd probably been the major point of contact with his father in his life which is when he was 15 and he had and his friend had been skiving off to the library to study their hobbies. Umm… and playing truant from school. Umm… and so he, uh… basically we went through a narrative retelling, retelling of this vivid memory. Umm… in the process of doing that he resolved the secondary task, the task that he had been uh… sort of playing with uh, uh… as another task in the first episode of the session which is how come I, I was the problematic child? Umm… and he resolved that, uh… in the context of doing that work around this memory in which his father umm… confronts him with having played truant and he says to his father, you know, you never loved me. You don't love me and his father bursts into tears and says, of course, I love you and then he realizes in the process of telling that story that why he did what he did? Why was he acting in a rebellious manner? So in fact he had been carrying this second task, umm… in a kind of slightly under the radar way and that, I think had to be kind of resolved and referring to really go to the main task of the session. This sets my construction of it. Umm… and so umm… having done that we then moved into the third episode of the session where he does another round of empty chair work with his father and get, I think, here is where he really gets to the heart of the unfinished business. Umm… and that's in the thing that's unfinished umm… and that quickly became clear, umm… in this part of the session that it was about guilt at having ah… push back his father attempt to reach out to him when his father was basically starting his dying process. And he kind of brushed his father aside when his father went down and he's feeling quite guilty about having let his father down. Umm… and that was the real core of the unfinished business, umm… in this part of the work and this is an interesting kind of unfinished business because normally we think of unfinished business, unresolved bad feelings towards an important person in our life. We normally think about that is something we didn't get from the other person, something that, some way in which the other person let us down. But there is another kind of unfinished business and that's something I didn't do, I let that other person down. I feel guilty. So I am the person who didn't meet someone else's needs. And it was this kind of unfinished business, umm… which wasn't at all clear at the beginning of the session, was this kind of unfinished business which is what really what the client was bringing in the session. So, umm… so then we entered into this work in which we, umm… he was imagining, interacting with his father, his father was, umm… in the hospital, umm hardly able to talk was deeply depressed and going in this sort of downward spiral and, umm… there was an important moment in the session, umm… and the client debriefing that he talks about, uh… the most, the best moment in the session being the point where umm… I reached out my hand as his father and had him take it, umm… and we had that physical contact where I was kind of enacting the father. Umm… and so that was a corrective experience in which he's able to repair that sense of having let his father down. Then I had him move into the father role and he spoke, umm… as the father and he said, let me go, I need you to let me go, let me die. And we then moved from that into the last fourth and final episode of the session which is the closure work and, umm… this is obviously quite deep work we're doing and, umm… this, we start the closure work about ten minutes from the end of the session. This is actually quite important. When you do this kind of work, you need to leave plenty of space at the end of the session, umm… to umm… have the client come out of it. Umm… in this case, we went through a series of processes as the client came out of it that mostly involved the process of self-soothing. Uh… so first, umm… we, we had him soothe the image of his father umm… and he imagined his father surrounded by love and everyone letting him go and basically giving him his blessing. Umm… and so that was a soothing, the image in sort of painful image of his father, I think when we're with you know, umm… important people in our lives in a dying process, we often take away a kind of toxic image of that person as they're dying and sort of we, we remember them in pain and distress feeling lost and abandoned and we were really working on helping him, uh… kind of revives this memory of his father and replace it with something more, more comforting and so, we were doing that work and then we moved out of that, that was a kind of closure of the empty chair work, moved that into reflecting on the work in the session. Umm… and that reflection, uh… and I, one of the things, I do is I'll ask clients about a physical state, if they had some sort of bodily tension or something when they entered into this session and started the work. I'll come back and ask them about that basically kind of emotional benchmark and when he, when we did that, he said, I've still got the headache that he told me about uh… much earlier in the session and so then we basically looked at what that needed and he proposed a process of breathing and relaxing which we spent a couple of minutes doing. Umm… well, I sort of commented on his process and this was in fact his own form self-soothing. So he was soothing himself as a way of closing up the work that we've been doing. And finally, we moved into relational, relational closure work where we, uh… sort of shared our experience of having done this and we thanked each other and we came to an ending. So we kind of worked our way out of the depth that we've been in through series of stages umm… and I think it's quite important to give clients a space to do that when you're doing this kind of intense work. 

00:15:20
Commentary 

00:15:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, so I'm gonna talk my way through a series of segments umm… in the session, umm… and provide some commentary on each one. 

00:15:40
Session begins 

00:15:45
ROBERT ELLIOT So Peter, I'm going to imagine a kind of bubble around the two of us so that we can turn our attention away from the cameras and everything in this situation 

00:15:55
PETER Uh-Huh! 

00:15:55
ROBERT ELLIOT And because I wanna be as completely focused on you as possible during this time. 

00:16:00
PETER Okay. 

00:16:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Is that okay? 

00:16:00
PETER Yeah. 

00:16:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. All right, so we have these 50 minutes and I know almost nothing about you. Umm… and I don't know where we will go. It's always an adventure. Umm… but I'm excited to, umm… to do this work with you and to meet you and so where would you like to start with? What do you bring today? 

00:16:30
PETER Yes, I've been putting a bit of thought into what to bring today and… I think the thing I wanted to, umm… share with you was about my parents. 

00:16:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Your parents, okay, okay. 

00:16:50
PETER Yeah. Particularly my father. 

00:16:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, okay. 

00:16:55
PETER I had a difficult relationship with both of my parents. 

00:16:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh-huh! 

00:17:00
PETER And, umm… my mother was particularly hard on me. 

00:17:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, okay. 

00:17:05
PETER And very critical of me. 

00:17:10
ROBERT ELLIOT So your mom was hard, the one that was hard on you, very critical. 

00:17:10
PETER Yes. 

00:17:10
ROBERT ELLIOT But your father was the one that you were bringing in today to work on. 

00:17:15
PETER That's right, that's right and the reason for that is that I felt that by the time my mother died, we had come to some, uh… understanding and I had come to a point where I felt I, I liked her. 

00:17:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… um-hmm, in spite of all that happened and you'd been through, the two of you had got to the point where you were able to, to like her actually. 

00:17:40
PETER Yeah. 

00:17:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Before she died, so that's somehow feels resolved for you. 

00:17:45
PETER Exactly, exactly that feels resolved. 

00:17:50
ROBERT ELLIOT All right. But, your father? 

00:17:50
PETER My father, I would describe as, umm… we never really connected. Umm… I am in my 60's. 

00:18:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. 

00:18:05
PETER And he died in the 1990's at the age of 80. 

00:18:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay so it's been now 20 years or something since he died. 

00:18:15
PETER That's right. 

00:18:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, okay when you were in your 40's. 

00:18:15
PETER Yup, yeah. 

00:18:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, okay. 

00:18:20
PETER And he was a man of his time. He was born in 1930 just before World War-I starts. 

00:18:25
ROBERT ELLIOT 1930 Okay, got it, okay. 

00:18:25
PETER And so my upbringing really, my early upbringing, I was born in 1946 and my early upbringing was in the late 40's and the 50's. And it was that type of household where children were seen and not heard and where, umm… big boys don't cry. 

00:18:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Shouldn't. 

00:18:50
PETER And my father, I think he was unusually, umm… I don't know what the, what the word is to describe him. Umm… blank. 

00:19:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Blank. Okay, a blank slate or a… 

00:19:05
PETER Yeah. 

00:19:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… yeah poker face or something. 

00:19:05
PETER The poker faced everybody described him as poker faced. 

00:19:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, good. 

00:19:10
PETER He had, he had a good sense of humor but he was a poker face sense of humor. 

00:19:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Got it. A dry humor. 

00:19:15
PETER Yeah. 

00:19:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Maybe, you couldn't even tell whether he was joking or not good. 

00:19:20
PETER You could usually tell he was joking. 

00:19:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, okay got it. 

00:19:20
PETER Yeah, it was, it was, uh… I suppose plays on words. That was, that was his idea of humor. 

00:19:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, kind of… 

00:19:30
PETER So it would be fairly what you might call forced humor but it was humor. 

00:19:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, okay. 

00:19:35
PETER And a very talented man. 

00:19:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. 

00:19:35
PETER Played the piano. 

00:19:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. 

00:19:40
PETER Umm… had come back from World War-II, having been wounded, maybe traumatized, he didn't talk much about that. 

00:19:50
ROBERT ELLIOT You never heard, right, okay. 

00:19:50
PETER No. 

00:19:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah. 

00:19:50
PETER And, as far as… I and my two brothers which was the family. 

00:19:55
ROBERT ELLIOT So you're? 

00:19:55
PETER I'm in the middle. 

00:20:00
ROBERT ELLIOT You're the middle of three brothers three boys. 

00:20:00
PETER Exactly. 

00:20:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. 

00:20:00
PETER So as far as I and my brothers were concerned, he was a rather distant figure. 

00:20:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. 

00:20:10
PETER Umm… he would be brought into force if we were naughty during the day and there would be, umm… you know some special ceremonial beating. 

00:20:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. 

00:20:20
PETER With our trousers down. 

00:20:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Got it. 

00:20:20
PETER So he was, very, very formal, his, his way of. 

00:20:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, and far mostly, if there was a problem, he would be brought into administer punishment or something? 

00:20:30
PETER Yes, that's right. 

00:20:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, okay. All right. 

00:20:35
PETER And so I really, I don't know whether this follows. Umm… but I felt that I did never got to know him. Uh… he was always at a distance and uh… I'm trying to, I'm trying to think back to. 

00:20:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Right now, you're thinking back. 

00:20:55
PETER Yes exactly. Right now, I'm trying to think back to the earliest days and… 

00:21:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Your earliest memories of him. 

00:21:00
PETER My earliest memories of him exactly. 

00:21:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. okay 

00:21:05
PETER And I, I can't really remember very much. 

00:21:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh-huh, uh-huh, he's kind of a blank. 

00:21:10
PETER A bit of a blank. 

00:21:10
ROBERT ELLIOT A bit of a blank, okay, alright, okay. 

00:21:15
PETER Yeah, I mean, he had his, he had his things that he would bring to the parties so to speak. I mean, he was very musical, wonderful pianist, I think I mentioned that already. He was full of umm… wanting us to be successful together with my mother and they were pushing us. 

00:21:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Pushing, encouraged you, pushed you. 

00:21:35
PETER Yes, they were pushing us to be successful. 

00:21:40
ROBERT ELLIOT So, so what feels unfinished with him, what, what's the thing that? 

00:21:45
PETER Umm… we never very seldom talked about how we felt about each other. 

00:21:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. So I never, you never told him what, how you felt about him and he never told you how he felt about you? 

00:22:00
PETER Very, very seldom. 

00:22:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Very seldom. Okay. All right. 

00:22:05
PETER Yeah, I remember, umm… 

00:22:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Go on, you remember something yeah. 

00:22:10
PETER Well, I do remember something when I was a young man or teenager, I can't remember. I had a lot of problems at home. I was seen as the, uh… the clumsy one, the difficult one. 

00:22:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. 

00:22:20
PETER My old brother was, uh… the clever one. 

00:22:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Got it, okay. There is the clever one and then the younger one. 

00:22:25
PETER My younger brother was seen as the well, and I felt he was the loved one. 

00:22:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Got it, okay, okay the one that everyone showered their affection on it. 

00:22:35
PETER That's what I felt. 

00:22:40
ROBERT ELLIOT That's what you felt, okay. And somehow, you were in the middle and you were lost out on both love and cleverness. 

00:22:40
PETER Yes, exactly. 

00:22:45
ROBERT ELLIOT And felt like somehow you were always the one who is trouble and got, maybe you got punished more. 

00:22:50
PETER Yeah. 

00:22:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. 

00:22:50
PETER Yeah, so why when I went to, umm… prep school as it was called. 

00:22:55
ROBERT ELLIOT okay. 

00:22:55
PETER At the age of, umm… seven or eight, why was I the one who is naughty, I don't know. I don't know why I was the one that had a system whereby, you, you umm… you lost conduct marks. You were given at the beginning of each quarter of the term, I think, it was called, a 100 conduct marks. 

00:23:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. 

00:23:20
PETER And, uh… why was I the one who you're supposed to have 50 at the end of the quarter. 

00:23:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Left okay, yeah. 

00:23:25
PETER To the left, uh… and to prove that you hadn't gone into decline. 

00:23:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, moral decline, right, okay. 

00:23:30
PETER And the, uh… exactly moral decline from the conduct point of view. And why was I the one who went down to zero? Sometimes even it went negative. 

00:23:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Negative, so your brothers would, they would get, you know, good marks for conduct, I think they can get, they would have their 50. 

00:23:50
PETER Yeah. Or more. 

00:23:50
ROBERT ELLIOT At the end or maybe more. Okay, okay and but you would go down and down and down and even into the negative territory. 

00:23:55
PETER So there must have been something I'm saying this now. There must have been something wrong with me, uh… at the age of seven or eight. 

00:24:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Right when you went away. So you're carrying something that wasn't right in your life and something that was bothering you. 

00:24:10
PETER Yeah, and I just don't know what it was. 

00:24:10
ROBERT ELLIOT And as you're telling me now, you're kind of thinking about that and seeing what is that? What was that? 

00:24:15
PETER Yeah, exactly. 

00:24:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah and if you, and your father is in there some place, I mean you… 

00:24:25
PETER Well, but I wouldn't say that just my father, it's my father and my mother and the family situation and the fact that, I felt, umm… I felt as if I was the silly one, that's what I was always told. 

00:24:40
ROBERT ELLIOT The silly one, okay. 

00:24:40
PETER Yeah, and also, umm… my mother was very concerned about my appearance. 

00:24:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. 

00:24:45
PETER And she would say sit up straight Peter. 

00:24:50
ROBERT ELLIOT She'll make you sit up straight, okay. 

00:24:50
PETER Yes and uh… oh God you poor thing, you've been herited my weak chin. That's what she used to say. That's what she said to one of my children. She said, oh, dear, you poor thing, you've been herited my tiny nose. She was into appearance. 

00:25:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Appearance, okay. 

00:25:05
PETER That's my mother. 

00:25:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. So there is the stuff with your father and something feels like there is a disconnection or a connection, you never got with him and now, you're thinking about or remembering something about like, what was it mean in the family and being the one who was always getting in trouble, getting marked off, umm… being clumsy or silly or having as if my, your parents fussed over, right. So is there something about your position in the family too, you're kind of thinking about. 

00:25:40
PETER Yeah, okay, that's right. Okay. 

00:25:45
ROBERT ELLIOT It is that connected to your dad or is it? 

00:25:45
PETER I think that honestly is connected to both of my parents. 

00:25:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Both of your parents. Okay, okay yeah. 

00:25:55
PETER Yeah, yeah probably more directly to my mother. Because, she would be explicit about things and I've given you a couple of examples. 

00:26:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Examples yeah. 

00:26:00
PETER Uh… whereas my father just had a perpetual sort of frown on his face. Umm… and I think he was seen by my mother, uh… as somehow not a success ultimately. 

00:26:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Sorry I missed for a minute there. Who was not a success? 

00:26:25
PETER My dad. 

00:26:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Your dad, okay, got it. It was your dad, okay. So he, he went around with a frown on his face and, and, and somehow the sense people in the family had was that he was not a successful as he should have been. 

00:26:40
PETER In my mother's eyes. 

00:26:40
ROBERT ELLIOT In your mother's eyes, got it. That she looked at him and you could see her looking at him and sort of judging him or something. He wasn't quite up there and that's in here now as you're remembering all these things. 

00:26:50
PETER That's right. Yeah, and as far as his, his relationship with me is concerned, he didn't seem to exist, uh… although as I say, he would be invoked to punish us. Umm… 

00:27:10
ROBERT ELLIOT But he was invisible other than that. 

00:27:10
PETER Yes, yes. 

00:27:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Invisible dad, right. 

00:27:15
PETER Yeah. 

00:27:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, and how does that sit with you that sense of his invisibility and the lack of connection they just want for you. 

00:27:20
PETER Yeah, I felt as if something missing. 

00:27:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Something's is missing. And you're, do you know where do you, can you capture that sense of something missing in you? 

00:27:35
PETER I don't know, I suppose I would describe it as pain. 

00:27:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Pain, where do you feel that pain? 

00:27:35
PETER I'm more likely to feel the pain, uh… in my head. 

00:27:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. All right, okay all right. Right, so right now, you can kind of feel a… 

00:27:45
PETER I can feel a headache. 

00:27:45
ROBERT ELLIOT A headache coming along, right, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah and just sort of soreness that you feel in your head about your dad or about?. 

00:28:00
PETER I'm not sure it is just about my dad. 

00:28:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Right, okay because we've been talking about other things in your family too. So somehow, it's a pain of all of that. 

00:28:10
PETER Umm… I just feel in the case of dad, that there is something missing. We never really like apart from just one or two occasions made contact. 

00:28:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Made contact. What's missing is that sense of contact. That's what you still after all these years, it's been there for 20 years. Something in you still want to make contact wishes you could make contact with him. 

00:28:35
PETER Uh-huh uh-huh. 

00:28:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Would that be something, you would be willing to work with a little bit here in this. 

00:28:40
PETER I could try. 

00:28:40
ROBERT ELLIOT You could try that, I mean, let's see, how it goes and it's supposed, an experiment to see. I mean, it would be involve, how you actually kind of imagining him in this other chair here, and that would be something that you'd, does that feel, and you hardly know me, so, right.? 

00:28:55
PETER Yeah, I'm willing to give it a try. 

00:29:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Give it a try, okay. All right, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna, umm… pull the chair up here and maybe you could turn your chair a little to face him. 

00:29:05
PETER Yup. 

00:29:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Because we want to help you, okay, making contact with him, all right. Yeah, yeah, drink water, yeah. So, can you picture and is this distance okay for? 

00:29:20
PETER Yeah, it's fine. Okay. 

00:29:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Not too close, not too far. The first segment I'm gonna talk about, umm… occurs, umm… sort of 10 to 15 minutes into the session and this is the marker, uh… and umm… it's a nice example of an EFT marker. So umm… in the first, umm… 10 or 12 minutes of the session, we've been looking for, umm… what the client's, the main focus of the client, what it was gonna be in the session which in the EFT, we call the marker. Umm… and at this point, the marker emerge clearly when the client said, umm… something about his father, something is missing. We never really made contact and this is a lovely example of an unfinished business marker, umm… and really indicated the entry into the, the second episode of the session which was gonna be a first round of empty chair work. Umm… and so what I did at that point, what I do at that point is confirm the marker, I reflected back to him. Umm… and he acknowledges that or agrees with my formulation, feels understood by it. Umm… and then I introduce the task, uh… and introducing a first piece of, of, of, of, of chair work on EFT is, uh… always a bit delicate because umm… in general clients think talking to furniture is crazy. With that said, normal response to being asked to have a conversation between two chairs or to imagine your, your, umm… deceased parent in an empty chair. So this is basically something we approach rather carefully. Umm… and, and sort of seeing if the client is up for it. In this case the client was up for it. Umm… and in fact I think had been probably anticipating it. Umm… so even though in a first session we don't normally do, umm… any kind of chair work, uh… because it revolves… involves taking the client, taking their eyes off the therapist. Umm… this client was clearly up for it and it felt appropriate and safe to proceed in that way. So, then basically I'm helping him set up the task. I have him imagine his father being present and, umm… that usually generates some sort of emotional reaction on the client we start at the empty chair work by having the client describe their emotional reaction to the image of the other and communicate it say it to the other person. So that was, that put us into the empty chair uh… task at that point. Can you picture him there? His picture of what how he would sit, what he would look like, the expression of his face may be his clothes? 

00:32:10
PETER Well, my most recent memory of dad. 

00:32:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, okay. 

00:32:15
PETER Umm… was awful. It was, really, really terrible. 

00:32:20
ROBERT ELLIOT This is when he was. 

00:32:20
PETER When he was old, yes. 

00:32:20
ROBERT ELLIOT When he was old is that the image of your dad, you want to work with you, is it? Is that the dad you missed, is that the dad, you missed contact with? 

00:32:30
PETER It's the dad I liked to have helped. 

00:32:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. Okay, that's here, even as you think about that. So actually that's the one you want to, that's the dad, you want to put there. 

00:32:40
PETER I wish, I could have helped him, you know ? 

00:32:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, okay and you feel that right now as you sit here. 

00:32:45
PETER Yeah. 

00:32:45
ROBERT ELLIOT So what's that feeling that comes up when you, when you picture him as old and unwell. 

00:32:50
PETER It's just so sad. 

00:32:50
ROBERT ELLIOT So sad, you feel so sad, right, yeah. Can you actually, what do you wish, you could have said to him when he was in that state? 

00:33:00
PETER Ah-huh, I wish I could have umm… I wish I could have taken away some of his troubles. 

00:33:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. 

00:33:10
PETER Because by the time he died he had umm… I suppose, well, he was diagnosed with depression, clinical depression and he went into a downward spiral. 

00:33:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Got it. So what is it, what, I mean, actually can you say, I feel so sad for you or what is it? 

00:33:35
PETER Yeah, I feel very sad for you dad and I just wish I could help you get out of this. 

00:33:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. I just wish, I could have helped you get out of it, yeah, yeah. Because I see you going down just spiraling down into that depression and I wanna, what do you wish, you could, yeah. 

00:33:55
PETER I mean, it's very difficult to know what to say to you dad because you are, umm… you've got this state now where you're almost silent, staring into space. 

00:34:15
ROBERT ELLIOT It's almost too late for you. Almost too late to make contact with you. 

00:34:15
PETER Exactly. 

00:34:15
ROBERT ELLIOT But I sure wish I could. 

00:34:20
PETER Yeah, I think the last time I saw him, I asked him a bit about his, uh… his earlier days and he had some electric shock treatment by this time. 

00:34:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Right, okay. 

00:34:30
PETER And was able to communicate again. 

00:34:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, he come back out a little bit. 

00:34:35
PETER He'd come back out a little bit. 

00:34:40
ROBERT ELLIOT So just like the last time I saw you, you were able to talk a bit yeah. 

00:34:45
PETER The last time, I feel this is, this difficult to, uh… to do. 

00:34:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Ah-huh, right now. 

00:34:50
PETER Right now, because if I say something like the last time I saw you, where in that means I'm talking to, umm… 

00:34:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Your not the person, 

00:35:00
PETER The late my dad. 

00:35:00
ROBERT ELLIOT And somehow something in you doesn't actually want to let go, right. It wanna. 

00:35:05
PETER Yeah, so it's hard. 

00:35:10
ROBERT ELLIOT It's hard too, truly hard to. 

00:35:15
PETER Yeah, so it is very hard to talk to you now dad because you're not there and, uh… I just wish, I had been able to communicate with you and make contact with you earlier on. We had some superficial, quite superficial contact the last couple of times, we spoke. 

00:35:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Yes. 

00:35:45
PETER Uh… I tried to umm… probably very cack handedly and ignorantly tried to cheer you up. 

00:35:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Right. And you wish, you could have done better. I wish, I could have done better for you. 

00:36:00
PETER Yeah, I wish, I could have done better for you. 

00:36:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe go back to that situation in your memory and imagine he's in that situation. He's had some of the ECT and he's able to talk a bit. What's that you wish you could have? 

00:36:15
PETER I wish, I could have told him, I loved him. 

00:36:15
ROBERT ELLIOT All right, yeah, yeah, would that be okay to try this out now? Yeah. 

00:36:20
PETER So, I, what I'd like to tell you dad and it's very difficult because we never talked about feelings together. 

00:36:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. 

00:36:30
PETER Umm… but I'd like to be able to say to you that I love you. 

00:36:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah, say this again. 

00:36:40
PETER I love you dad. 

00:36:40
ROBERT ELLIOT I love you dad. All right, yeah. And what it's, it's so painful for me to see you suffering at all. 

00:36:50
PETER It's difficult and I think the other thing that's hard is that I know that if I say something like that to you, it's awkward, it's slightly awkward for me but from what you've always said to me is particularly awkward for you because… 

00:37:10
ROBERT ELLIOT I can see how awkward, you are with feelings but how much I wanna reach out you I guess. 

00:37:15
PETER Yeah, it's awkward for me. Definitely, it's awkward for me because I find it difficult to, to umm, contact my own feelings. 

00:37:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. 

00:37:25
PETER But I know that it's awkward for you and is that to do with your own upbringing. It is to do with what happened to you as a child from what I can tell. You had a close relationship with your mum but, uh… you never seem to be able to talk to us. 

00:37:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah and I guess, it really feel like I missed out I wanted to have more of a relationship with you. 

00:37:55
PETER Absolutely. 

00:37:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, okay. Can you describe some of the things you wish you could have had in that relationship with him? 

00:38:05
PETER Well, we never hugged. 

00:38:05
ROBERT ELLIOT We never hugged. I wished we could have hugged. 

00:38:05
PETER I wish, we could have hugged dad. 

00:38:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, what else? 

00:38:15
PETER Umm… well that's. 

00:38:15
ROBERT ELLIOT That's the biggest thing. 

00:38:15
PETER That's the biggest thing. 

00:38:15
ROBERT ELLIOT That's the biggest thing of just, you could have hugged you know, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I needed. I needed. 

00:38:25
PETER Well, we never did. I just feels like, the only way I can express it is if something that wasn't there rather than something, rather than something that, that, I have to express it in a negative way unfortunately. 

00:38:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Alright, yeah, here, I was that, you know, this kid he was always getting in trouble and people were always sort of down on my case and I just needed you to, about somehow, you know, see, I was struggling instead of beating me umm… 

00:39:00
PETER I needed you to be kind. 

00:39:00
ROBERT ELLIOT I needed you to be kind. I needed you to be kind, yeah. To be there and be kind, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:39:15
PETER I remember once, I don't know whether you remember this dad. Uh… and it's a very, very vivid memory for me. I'm trying to, I'll tell you what the context was. Uh… and I was probably 13, 15 by this time. 

00:39:30
ROBERT ELLIOT 15, okay. 

00:39:35
PETER And for some reason it was to do with work problems, problem at work, problems with work at school. 

00:39:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. 

00:39:45
PETER I and another friend of mine decided to take time off school and we told you and mom that, umm… we're going to school. 

00:39:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Mmm-huh 

00:39:55
PETER Umm… but what we did is we went into center of Birmingham where the school was to the library and uh… we read about uh… hobby. 

00:40:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, okay. 

00:40:05
PETER And research of our hobby which was a lot more interesting than the school work we should have, I was pulling behind, it was physics. 

00:40:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. 

00:40:15
PETER And, umm… I wrote a letter to the school and said Peter is not well and I signed letter. Uh… and as far as the school was concerned, I was off sick. 

00:40:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah 

00:40:30
PETER Well, that was probably very poorly forged letter and eventually, it took them a week or two to phone my parents and say, umm… where's Peter, is he really off sick? My parents were shocked. 

00:40:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Right You'd been nicked, been. 

00:40:50
PETER We were playing truant all fortnight, I think it was a fortnight, it might have been a week but anyway, it was a significant time. 

00:41:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, okay. 

00:41:00
PETER And, umm… I got home from, my research in the library and said, hello mum. She said, what have you been doing? I said I've been at school. And she said, it sounds like a lie. You wait till your father gets home. And it all came out into the open. They just couldn't understand what was going on and I, umm… 

00:41:35
ROBERT ELLIOT This is both you and your brother, right? 

00:41:35
PETER No, me and a friend. 

00:41:35
ROBERT ELLIOT A friend, sorry, a friend Okay got it. 

00:41:40
PETER Yeah, I really have to talk to you about this because it's not a conversation with my dad. 

00:41:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, so you and your friend, okay got it okay. And so then, 

00:41:45
PETER And so. 

00:41:50
ROBERT ELLIOT You waited sort of in terror for your father to come home. 

00:41:50
PETER Yeah, that's right and I can't remember what the punishment was. Umm… the school was punishing us anyway. Putting us in detention everyday… 

00:42:00
ROBERT ELLIOT You get a lot of, lot of demerits for that one, right. 

00:42:05
PETER Yeah, that's right. Yeah, conduct marks. It was a different school by this time. 

00:42:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Right okay. 

00:42:10
PETER Umm… but I did have an interview with my father that evening, one on one. 

00:42:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah. 

00:42:15
PETER And I said, well I'll tell you what all this is about dad. You don't love me and you never have loved me. 

00:42:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Got it, okay. 

00:42:20
PETER And for the first time in my life, he, he burst into tears. He actually wept and said, of course, I love you. How can you say that? And so perhaps, I don't know whether I would have wanted to reminiscent about that with him. 

00:42:40
ROBERT ELLIOT With him right you remember that time. 

00:42:45
PETER But, it's a, it was a very important moment because for once in his life he did break down and, uh… told me he loved, love me and when, when now I think about it to tell you about it. 

00:43:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, okay. 

00:43:00
PETER I don't remember telling him I loved him because, perhaps I wasn't very good at that. 

00:43:10
ROBERT ELLIOT All right, yeah and I guess, you were so angry at the time. 

00:43:10
PETER Yeah, yeah. 

00:43:10
ROBERT ELLIOT And, umm… I guess I'm picturing you're kind of scared and angry and scared what's gonna happen to you. 

00:43:20
PETER Yeah, yeah. 

00:43:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Angry about the whole thing. 

00:43:20
PETER Yeah, why did you do this Peter? It would have been his approach because that's what parents say. 

00:43:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah, that's what you're expecting from him. 

00:43:25
PETER Yeah, so he was saying it. Why did you do it? He just don't understand. And maybe it was a sort of last resort thing for me to say. Umm… well I'll tell you why, it's because, you don't love me. 

00:43:40
ROBERT ELLIOT So remember the time was back there, remember the time when, when I skived off school for, for a long time and you, when you asked me why I've done it, I said, because you don't love me. 

00:43:55
PETER Yeah. 

00:43:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah, remember that time, he burst into tears. Yeah, so. 

00:44:00
PETER So, if I were to say that to my dad I now, uh… I will say it because you're suggesting that I do. Umm… dad do you remember the time when I was just 14 or 15 years old, and I skived off school through that time and I was, you were exasperated. You'd, umm… for a few minutes, you'd come out of your, umm… your shell that you occupy. 

00:44:35
ROBERT ELLIOT I saw the real you in that moment. 

00:44:35
PETER Yeah Saw the real you and you said to me why did you do this Peter? And I, I, I don't know whether, what made me say it because I've never said this to you before. 

00:44:50
ROBERT ELLIOT I wouldn't dare it. 

00:44:50
PETER Yeah, uh… I said it's perhaps, it's to attract, it's to attract your attention. 

00:45:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Don't you know, I was just trying to get your attention, right Okay. 

00:45:05
PETER And then he just realized that as I said it. 

00:45:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Alright now, okay. 

00:45:05
PETER It was to attract your attention and to plead with you to show me some affection and umm… because I don't frankly, I don't think, you love me uh… You don't love me. 

00:45:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah yeah. 

00:45:20
PETER And what you said dad was, I do and you burst into tears. And I'm very, very seldom seen you bursting into tears. 

00:45:30
ROBERT ELLIOT The second segment I want to talk about umm… had to do with the resolution of this secondary task, uh… the client had come to this session with another task besides the unfinished business with his father and the secondary task was trying to figure out what it was that made him feel like he was a problematic child. He was the person that always got in trouble, always had something wrong with him and, umm… so he had been telling me a story, the story about his the confrontation between him and his father when he was 15 and his, he'd been caught umm… playing truant from the school and umm… his father says, why did you do this? His father confronts him umm… and he says, why did you do this and he says, it was just to attract your attention and umm… the client umm… says I've just realized something, umm… I've just realized that the reason, I was always getting in trouble was that I really wanted my father's attention and so he had what we call an insight, he had an insight marker, the I've just realized that is an indication that some kind of shift in our self-understanding has occurred, an insight a new understanding, something that haven't made sense before has come in… clicked into place. And so, umm… although, EFT is not primarily an insight oriented therapy, you know, we value awareness or insight, umm… the, we'll take insight when it comes, insight is, uh… I think a powerful process. Particularly when it's emotionally loaded when it's got, umm… you know, it's felt emotionally not just in the head. I think that was the case here that the client had made an emotional connection between his, uh… sort of angry confrontation of his father, umm… for not loving him or you know, confronting his father with his experience of his that his father didn't love him and his father then basically responding in tears, saying of course, I love you and he then realizes that, that was what it was all about that he had been rebellious, umm… at least in part because he needed his father's attention, have a sense of that. So that's a really interesting moment and I think that's one of the, one of the, you know, couple of critical moments for important change of events in this session. What was that like for you, remembering that moment when he burst into tears. 

00:48:10
PETER What's that like for me now or what was it like? 

00:48:10
ROBERT ELLIOT What was it like for you then and now, We will start with then. 

00:48:15
PETER Starting… I don't know maybe it was some sort of relief. Some sort of relief. 

00:48:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, something and you just relieved actually, he does love me. 

00:48:25
PETER Yeah, it was a bit like the relief you get if you've got a balloon and it bursts. 

00:48:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Right, right, yes, yes painful. 

00:48:35
PETER Yeah, completely painful relief. 

00:48:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, okay, okay and I got a sense of relief, it hurt but it was like I knew that you did care. 

00:48:45
PETER That's it, that's it. 

00:48:45
ROBERT ELLIOT That's it, I knew that you did care and I saw this glimpse just for that moment. 

00:48:50
PETER Hmm… 

00:48:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. 

00:48:55
PETER But the thing that I do feel sad about is that you seem to get, umm… lower and lower and lower as you got older and then you had umm… what my mother called a nervous breakdown which is you went, uh… you sat in the sitting room and stared into space and she couldn't get a word out of you. 

00:49:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. 

00:49:25
PETER And she phoned me, I'm not sure whether she phoned me because uh… I suppose to one of the other brothers, umm… because I'm, umm… the nicest of the three of us. 

00:49:45
ROBERT ELLIOT I see. 

00:49:45
PETER Or whether it was because I was geographically slightly near and she said, you've got to come. 

00:49:50
ROBERT ELLIOT You've got to come. 

00:49:55
PETER And something has gone wrong with dad. I can't cope. And I did and I got into the car and by the time I got there, he was just about okay. He was, he was… 

00:50:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, by the time I got there, he had started to come out of it, I guess. 

00:50:15
PETER Yeah, by the time I got there, he had started to come out of it dad and what you did was very strange thing. You started doing a handover of all your, umm… finances… 

00:50:25
ROBERT ELLIOT To me. 

00:50:25
PETER To me, yeah. You said this is where I keep the electricity bills. This is where I keep the information about the house and this is where I keep different other papers. 

00:50:40
ROBERT ELLIOT As if you decided, it's time for you to die or something. 

00:50:40
PETER Yeah exactly, this is, this is my guide to my filing system. 

00:50:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, right, yeah. 

00:50:50
PETER And, uh… also uh… I remember you handing over umm… a little obituary about yourself. 

00:50:55
ROBERT ELLIOT That you had written. 

00:51:00
PETER Yes, that you'd written an autobiography. A small autobiography, your life story and he said, I thought you'd be interested. This is my CV umm… and uh… so I took these on board, I feel I wasn't as, I feel guilty because I wasn't as helpful. I was probably a bit fictitious. 

00:51:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. You didn't, I didn't take you entirely seriously. 

00:51:25
PETER Exactly, I didn't take you entirely seriously. Umm… and I can't remember the details but I'm sure, I wasn't sympathetic and kind and I feel guilty about that. 

00:51:40
ROBERT ELLIOT So right now, as you're talking, you're feeling you're remembering and feeling this guilt, right. So the next segment I'm going to talk about, uh… occurs at the beginning of the third episode which is the second round of empty chair work and, umm… here having resolved the, that secondary task umm… around his sense of having been a problematic child, we then come back to, uh… the umm… the main unfinished business with his father. Umm… and umm… he uh… begins uh… he talks about his father in the hospital. Umm… and his father getting sinking lower and lower of his father's break down, umm… and umm… he is, you know, uh… and, and the interesting thing about this is that the unmet need, uh… here is uh… something he hasn't done. So this is this other kind of unfinished business. Umm… it's not about what I didn't get from someone else, important in my life but what how I let someone else down in my life. So uh… the emotion here umm… is I think a little bit controversial but I call it adapt, primary adaptive guilt. So were a psychotherapists and counselors we're used to thinking of guilt as, umm… you know excessive as a problem, as something to be resolved or relieved or gotten rid of, uh… basically a maladaptive uh… emotion umm… or a secondary active emotion. So we think of guilt in a kind of negative terms but I believe that there is a kind, I, I believe that human beings have guilt uh… because we're animals that live in relationship. Umm… and we have guilt to tell us when we have injured someone important to us. And guilt motivates us to repair the injury that we have caused this other person uh… and so umm… the client here begins to move in, reveals his sense of having let his father down and he's really experiencing this primary adaptive guilt that's saying, you know, you, you did something to that harmed or led to the harm of the person close to you, important to you in your life and it's motivating him to do something to repair it. Now, of course, his father is dead and so how do you repair a guilt towards someone that you can no longer go up to and do something to, you know, in some way, umm… make them feel better. Umm… all we have is this image of his father. So we have to work with the image of the father. So this segment really starts with his, you know, him arriving at the, umm… his primary adaptive guilt. What is that you wish you could have done for him then? 

00:54:30
PETER Ah… I wish I could have been kinder. 

00:54:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, all right. Like what specific, be specific. 

00:54:35
PETER Uh… I wish I could have, I wish I could have sat with you dad and umm… try to find out how you're feeling and why you are wanting to, to do this handover. Why mom had, had found you in such a state rather than batting away, what you were saying, I remember you were saying something well, I give my work how, this was at the age of 80. 

00:55:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh-huh I've given up? 

00:55:05
PETER I've given up work. This was what dad said. 

00:55:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, okay. 

00:55:10
PETER I've given up work now. Umm… and our finances are going to be in a complete mess. So that was the root of, of your worries. You were worried that you weren't going to be able to make ends meet. 

00:55:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Right. 

00:55:25
PETER Which was rubbish, we found out later but. It's. 

00:55:25
ROBERT ELLIOT But somehow… 

00:55:30
PETER I've batted it away. 

00:55:30
ROBERT ELLIOT yeah. 

00:55:30
PETER That's a ridiculous. You'd be fine. 

00:55:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, okay. And now you regret that? 

00:55:35
PETER I regret that. 

00:55:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, you wish you had. 

00:55:40
PETER I wish I had sat there and listened to what his worries were and it might have helped because what happened then is that, uh… I went back home and the next morning mom phoned and said, well, he wouldn't come to bed. He start staring into space. I called the doctor and umm… they've taken him away. 

00:56:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Right, okay. 

00:56:05
PETER I, I don't know much about these things, is that then in directly being put into a strait jacket and, and being. 

00:56:10
ROBERT ELLIOT So I wasn't there for you when you really needed me. 

00:56:15
PETER I wasn't there for you, dad. 

00:56:15
ROBERT ELLIOT I wasn't there, I wasn't able to like, take you seriously and help you open up and to find out what was really going on and then you just got worse and worse. 

00:56:25
PETER Yeah, it's funny. I'm finding it difficult to, to get out of the habit of going into third person narrative rather than in first, second person communication. 

00:56:40
ROBERT ELLIOT I mean, you're also telling me the story too. 

00:56:40
PETER Yeah. 

00:56:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… and we're trying to work with and you have an image of him, you kind of, this is just the dad you've carried around in your head all these years. And this dad that you've let down when he was, you know, so doing so badly and needed you alight and so piece of the disconnection, I guess is this guilt, not having been there? 

00:57:00
PETER Yup yeah. 

00:57:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah! So the next segment that I wanna point out umm… occurs pretty much straight after the previous segment I'm talking about. So uh… we're about to go into this, uh… another second round of empty chair work but first the client comes out of role, he comes out of the task and he moves in back into relational contact with me, umm… by and he says, it's funny, I'm finding, umm… it difficult to stay in the second person addressing my father I keep wanting to speak in the third person and talk about my father to you. And so he's kind of, uh… a bit concerned about whether he's being a good client, whether he's somehow not doing the task right and it's I think very common for, for clients to worry about how they're doing in this, in the therapy session to feel they're somehow, uh… not up to scratch or they're letting the therapist down. And so we have a little bit of a kind of relational wrinkle here where the client feels he's not performing, umm… adequately and of course, he's doing just fine. Umm… it's absolutely perfectly normal for clients to uh… go back and forth between talking to the therapist and talking to the other person in the empty chair. Uh… as EFT therapist, we understand this is as natural part of the process and in fact, it's what makes it possible to do the empty chair work is that, is that continued sense of relational contact with a therapist. So the client has basically kind of his internal critic is activated. He's a bit worried about, umm… not doing it right and so, umm… then we need to do a little bit, it's like a little mini task ah… addressing his concern about that. And so what I do is I, umm… I normalize his experience to say, this is absolutely typical which it is, umm… and, umm… you know, as far as I'm concerned, it's not the client's job, the client just follows what his experience needs. So his experience need to tell me the story, umm… that's fine then I'll direct him back into the dialogue with his father after he has told me that we do that all the time. So I reassure him about that and then he also, uh… kind of formulate an understanding. So we kind of go back over given my sense of, of what's going on and how the things fit together and I make an emphatic conjecture that this, umm… that this guilt is a part of his sense of disconnection that is coming to this session with. And so we kind of do a little bit of formulation. That formulation is a piece of this repair work and this is an example of how an EFT, umm… the more teaching or didactic parts of EFT which we call experience, teaching, uh… these get done when we need to in the middle of some of your work, you know, if there is a glitch in the work, we'll stop and talk a little bit about, umm… you know, how it, you know, our understanding of, of how it works and kind of give the client a bit of reassurance in some way and information. So it's a really good, so I picked out the segment because I think, it's a good example of how we, uh… add in this informational or experiential teaching element of the EFT when there is some kind of, umm… glitch or slight difficulty or wrinkle in the process. 

01:00:30
PETER I'm sure, I could have helped him. I'm sure, I could have helped you dad. And I wish I had and I'm sorry I'm sorry. 

01:00:35
ROBERT ELLIOT I'm sorry yeah, yeah. So I really wish, I could have, I wish I had, I would have had, I could have and I wish I would have. 

01:00:45
PETER You're exactly right. Because the next thing that happened is I cant see you in a hospital. Just an unbelievable sight even at this early stage in your illness, it took you three months to die and even at his early stage, you were just lying and staring into space. You couldn't, anything you could say was, umm… I was talking to you and the only thing you could say was, yes, waiting, we get sort of strangled sound coming out of your mouth. It was the word yes. But you said, yes, yes. 

01:01:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Yes, yes, yes. I could say, all right. 

01:01:35
PETER We were all, uh…. 

01:01:35
ROBERT ELLIOT And what do you wish, you could have said to him at that point when he was in the hospital and doing so badly and… 

01:01:45
PETER I wish I could have held his hand. 

01:01:45
ROBERT ELLIOT I wish I could have held your hand yeah. 

01:01:50
PETER So yes, it's the physical contact that I'm mentioning. 

01:01:50
ROBERT ELLIOT All right, okay. 

01:01:50
PETER We never had. 

01:01:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Can you actually imagine reaching out to his hand and if you want to take my hand or would… 

01:02:05
PETER Yeah, I just wish, I could have held your hand like this dad. I never did. 

01:02:10
ROBERT ELLIOT You never did, right, yeah. I wish, I could have held your hand and well just been there. 

01:02:15
PETER Yeah. 

01:02:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, been there in physical contact. That's what I wish. And I really feel sad that I wasn't able to do that. 

01:02:25
PETER That's right. 

01:02:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah. Yeah, okay. The next segment I think is the real kind of high point of this session or the point of greatest depth, uh… and this is, umm… the moment when umm… uh… I reached out my hand and enacted the father you know, on his, in his sort of dying process in the hospital. I enacted the father in him, you know, making physical contact through holding hands. And, umm… so this is a really important part of the session umm… and, umm… maybe it's the first time I've ever actually done that particular, umm… kind of work with a client, umm… where there is that physical contact where I'm in that physically enacting, umm… that the role of the other kind of so that the client can enact his own role. So what did happen was that, umm… you know, any empty chair work we, uh… are trying to help the client access the unmet need. What did you need, what is that you wish you could have said to him, the thing that was unspoken or unsaid or undone and, umm… the client returns this idea of physical contact. He talked earlier in the session about, umm… just wanting to be held by his father, umm… and so, he remembers this, you know, need for physical contact and so we had his need for physical contact, his father, father's need for some kind of support and reassurance the client sense of guilt at having let his father down by not making contact. Umm… and so I kind of hesitate for a moment, I think you know, umm… how it would be, you know, if I just, will it be okay with the client, if I offer my hand as the father. So I leaned forward in the chair and kind of leaned towards the father's chair to kind of align myself with the, the image of the father and then had him reach out his hand and take mine. We helped clasped hands, umm… to give him that bodily sense of, umm… of making that physical contact with his father which both he and his father needed and, umm… and so that was a really, I think important moment in the session, umm… yeah. Now, if you were to go over and be your dad, could you do that? 

01:05:05
PETER Yeah. 

01:05:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. What's his name? 

01:05:10
PETER Tom. 

01:05:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Tom, can you come over and be Tom? 

01:05:15
[sil.] 

01:05:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Responding to Peter, so Peter has come to see you and he said he's sorry and he's reached out and taking your hand, yeah and he's, I guess apologized and, what do you? 

01:05:40
TOM This is a hard one. 

01:05:40
ROBERT ELLIOT This is a hard one, yeah, yeah. 

01:05:50
TOM Umm… because uh… I feel just so desperate and so low, yeah. 

01:06:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Right I feel so desperate. 

01:06:05
TOM And so low that it's, uh… it's I just want to go. 

01:06:10
ROBERT ELLIOT I just want to go, I just wanna die. 

01:06:15
TOM Yeah. 

01:06:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah. 

01:06:15
TOM Exactly. 

01:06:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, I just wanna die and… 

01:06:20
TOM And thank you for trying and for making the effort and holding my hand. But… I've had enough. 

01:06:35
ROBERT ELLIOT I've had enough. Yeah. I don't want to be alive anymore. 

01:06:40
TOM No. 

01:06:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah. It's time for me to go. 

01:06:40
TOM That's right. 

01:06:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. Right. 

01:06:50
TOM And… I've started to have really strange feelings as well. 

01:06:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. 

01:06:55
TOM Uh… about, about the world. It's not a place I want to be in anymore. 

01:07:05
ROBERT ELLIOT I don't want to be in this world anymore, not this kind of world, yeah. So I just wanna go and what I want you to let me go? I want you to, what do you? 

01:07:15
TOM I suppose, that's what it is, yeah, yeah. Umm… for example, umm… if we move forward a couple of months and I'm still Tom and, uh… I've stopped eating and I just want you to let me go. I know, you mean well and, uh… I know your mother means well. She's been wonderful, these last few weeks. But I just want to go. 

01:08:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah. 

01:08:00
TOM And I want to, umm… I want mum to have enough money to live on. 

01:08:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Right, okay. 

01:08:10
TOM And I just want to go. 

01:08:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Right, so I don't want anymore money spent on my care. 

01:08:15
TOM Exactly. 

01:08:20
ROBERT ELLIOT And I want to let go, I just want to go. I'm tired of living yeah. So let me go. 

01:08:25
TOM Yeah, yeah. 

01:08:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Change, can you go over and be Peter again? It's a really, powerful things here life and death, right. So what, what do you say to him? 

01:08:40
PETER Well, I feel like saying, that's all right. 

01:08:45
ROBERT ELLIOT That's all right, yeah, yeah. 

01:08:45
PETER And we'll all remember the good things about you. 

01:08:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah, we'll remember the good times, the good things, your sense of humor, your piano playing. 

01:08:55
PETER Yeah. 

01:09:00
ROBERT ELLIOT How you were before you got fell into a hole. 

01:09:00
PETER Absolutely. 

01:09:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. And it's okay for you to go, now. 

01:09:05
PETER That's what I feel like saying it. 

01:09:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, say that to him. 

01:09:10
PETER So if you feel, it's time for you to go, although, you've got the doctors there, fighting to keep you alive and then I know that, right at the end of your life, during the pneumonia, you're on some sort of, umm… I think it was a life support system, it was, it was something. I don't know what it was, it was, it was a drip. 

01:09:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, the drip. 

01:09:40
PETER To try and keep you alive and you pulled it out. So, sometimes I know you feel you're fighting to be allowed to live. 

01:09:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

01:09:55
PETER But, umm… I understand. Everybody comes to the end and you feel, this is your time. 

01:10:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah, they deserve to choose their time, they deserve to. 

01:10:10
PETER Yeah. 

01:10:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, to go when they're ready to go. 

01:10:15
PETER Yeah. 

01:10:15
ROBERT ELLIOT So the next segment, I want to talk about is the transition or the opening of the last segment of the session which is the closure part of the session which is the last ten minutes of the session and, umm… you know at this point, ending the previous, umm… episode with the expression of the, you know, making the contact with the father and then we did begin to hear from the, the client speaking his father as this need to be let go to be allowed to go. Umm… and at that point, I wasn't sure, if he was done or not but we were running low on time and so I give him a, a sort of five minute warning which is actually a ten minute warning but, umm… it felt like it was really important to have plenty of space for closure in this session, to allow the client to come out. So, umm… so I, I said, umm… we're gonna need to end in a few minutes and is there anything else that you need to say or do with your father? I, I, it wasn't that I knew, I had an agenda, uh… I was simply making space to see, uh… how much work, what kind of work, uh… and also for him to check inside and see, what felt like was still unfinished and that's an important part of doing unfinished business work is this, you know, checking inside and so, then the client moved into this, ah, you're a good person, you're brave, uh… which is really soothing the image of his father. So that was, that was the thing that was, uh… still felt like I needed to be done by the client. That was the piece that was still missing and we then moved into this soothing image of the father, umm… the letting go and, him the client, umm… conjuring up this image of the whole family, umm… surrounding him with the father with love and, umm… it's a really lovely example of a sort of transforming the kind of toxic images of a, you know, an important person who is dying or in distress, really lovely example of how, umm… you know, it's coming from a client, you know, I didn't suggest, the imagery of being surrounded by love. I picked that up but, umm… I said, say it again, but that was, a really nice example of how from the client knows what he needs, what he needs to say to his father and what he needs to do at that point to help sort of close things up. Is there anything else, we're gonna need to end in a few minutes. But is there anything else that you wanna say or to him or…? 

01:12:50
PETER I think, you are very good person. 

01:12:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. I think, you were a good person. 

01:12:50
PETER And I think, you overall was loyal. 

01:13:00
ROBERT ELLIOT You were loyal, okay. 

01:13:00
PETER Brave. 

01:13:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Brave, okay. Even in the war, maybe or even, you know traumatized in the war but somehow, you were a loyal brave person, a good person. 

01:13:15
PETER Yeah, yeah and I know you've had, umm… ups and downs with mum but she really does love you. 

01:13:25
ROBERT ELLIOT She does love you, okay. So you're loved, I love you and she loves you. 

01:13:25
PETER Yeah. 

01:13:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah. And even though, you want, you feel ready to go and you need to go now, I want you to know that as you go that, we love you. 

01:13:40
PETER Yeah. That's what I'd like to say to you dad. 

01:13:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah. 

01:13:40
PETER All the people around you love you. 

01:13:45
ROBERT ELLIOT And surrounded by people who love you. 

01:13:50
PETER They respect your decision. 

01:13:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. Okay. Maybe just say that again, right, yeah. 

01:14:00
PETER I just wanted to remind you dad that you are surrounded by people who love you and that means me and mom and Richard and Laurance and all, all your family. 

01:14:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. So it's like you go, surrounded by all this love. 

01:14:20
PETER Yeah and if it's your wish to leave the world now, that's, that's your privilege to be able to do that. It's not for us to hold onto you and keep you behind and tug at you. 

01:14:45
[sil.] 

01:14:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Anything else? In decide him. Right now. 

01:14:55
PETER No, that's it. 

01:14:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, maybe, maybe say a goodbye then, is that okay? 

01:15:00
PETER Yeah. So now, it's time to say goodbye. I let you go. 

01:15:15
ROBERT ELLIOT So, it's like, I let you go. 

01:15:15
PETER Yeah. 

01:15:20
[sil.] 

01:15:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Is it okay to come back, I mean, turn your chair around, so we're facing each other again and yeah, okay. Spend a couple of minutes just seeing where you are right now. It's a big process. It's quite deep, right. 

01:15:45
PETER Yeah, quite deep as you say. 

01:15:45
ROBERT ELLIOT What, what do you experience right now? So we… 

01:15:50
PETER Well, I could feel, umm… as if it was happening, as if it was really happening. 

01:15:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. 

01:15:55
PETER So now, I'm feeling as if, uh… I don't know whether the word is catharsis, as if, uh… let something go that I hadn't like before. 

01:16:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, so that fits, you feel like I'll let go of something? 

01:16:10
PETER Yeah, yeah. 

01:16:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, it does, okay. With said, like, how does it feel in your body? 

01:16:20
PETER Umm… a little bit, a little bit of relief and release. 

01:16:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay. Where do you feel that? 

01:16:25
PETER Umm… just a bit more relaxed. 

01:16:30
ROBERT ELLIOT In your chest. 

01:16:30
PETER Yes. 

01:16:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, as if you could breath more easily or something. 

01:16:35
PETER Yeah, that's right. Yeah. 

01:16:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, okay, and the headache, what happened, where is that? 

01:16:40
PETER Uh… headache is still there. 

01:16:45
ROBERT ELLIOT The last, umm… segment that I want to talk about occurs right at the end of the session. It's the part where, umm… uh… I'm checking with the client about his, uh… what he's, how he's doing now as we end the session and he says, he experiences a sense of relief in his body. We look at that briefly. I then remember the headache that he's mentioned earlier in the session, umm… which, umm… uh… I decide to use as a benchmark of his current state. Umm… so I ask him about the headache and he reveals that he still has the headache. So he's feeling relief, I suspect, he's feeling relief in his trunk area of his body but there is the head that still, still, umm… hurting and so, umm… I, we, you know, I ask him what he, what he wants to do with it and, umm… he then goes into a breathing exercise, umm… that he's picked up, umm… and, and looks, looks like he uses and so, umm… he begins to do systematic breathing, quite deep sort of full lung breath, umm… process and, umm… you know, I think it's really important to support clients in whatever method they have of coming to closure, moderating their emotions especially at the end of the session, so I'm very happy for him to, to use this method which works for him, umm… but in, in said that it's very much in keeping with what the EFT to allow that Uh… it does for me, it did for me raise a question about how, what I should do during that, that space while he's doing that and, umm… uh… rather than choose to be silent here, I've seen to me that I, that I been quite present all the way through, so I wanted to maintain a presence with him. Umm… and so I did sort of low key kind of not reflections of his non- verbal, umm… actions which we call contact reflections. Umm… and, uh… these are just little points of contacts, so I, comment at one point on the, his sort of fully exhaling his breath, umm… he's just taking some time. So I'm just putting a little bit of contact there and I'm hoping that it's not intrusive. Umm… but as I said, it's in keeping with I've been with him all the way, through this session to try to keep that sense of empathic connection. Okay, okay. All right, does the headache need anything right now, right now? 

01:19:15
PETER Uh… it probably just needs for me to sit quietly and, umm… do some breathing. 

01:19:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Do some breathing. Just have some space okay. 

01:19:30
PETER Yeah, yeah. I don't know, whether this time for that now. Is there? Okay because I, I'm, I'm not conscious of how many, how many minutes we've had. 

01:19:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Oh, yeah, we've got a couple of minutes, okay. Would it feel right just to take. 

01:19:45
PETER Yes. 

01:19:45
ROBERT ELLIOT A moment just to kind of have your feet on the ground, it should do and just. 

01:19:50
PETER Exactly yes. 

01:19:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Just sit and just. 

01:19:50
PETER Close my eyes. 

01:19:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, okay, close your eyes. 

01:19:55
PETER I don't think, I'm gonna lean backwards 

01:19:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Okay, whatever, okay, feels right to sit straight up. Yeah. 

01:20:00
[sil.] 

01:20:05
ROBERT ELLIOT I guess, you just feel that sense of relief and release and… And you're breathing out… 

01:20:20
[sil.] 

01:20:35
ROBERT ELLIOT All right. Blowing all the air out, yeah. 

01:20:40
[sil.] 

01:21:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Just taking some time, yeah, yeah. 

01:21:10
PETER That was helpful. 

01:21:10
ROBERT ELLIOT That was helpful just to come back to yourself and, and come back into the present moment and. 

01:21:15
PETER Exactly, yeah, yeah. 

01:21:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, so that's kind of really, really powerful and I want to thank you for going there with me and do some things that were quite painful and, and, umm… deep right and, umm… I just feel very moved and touched by, umm… what you've been able to bring here and the whole process, uh… I can recognize that from things in my own life and it was such a really a privilege to be able to go in that journey with you today in this time. 

01:21:55
PETER Well, thank you. 

01:22:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Thank you. 

01:22:00
PETER Thank you. 

01:22:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

01:22:00
PETER It's still with me. It will remain with me. 

01:22:05
ROBERT ELLIOT It's still with you, okay. And sometimes, these things take a while to just kind of process and work things those out and, yeah, so, maybe you'll, I guess, you will be carrying that with you and reflect on it more, all right. But is it okay, if we end now? 

01:22:25
PETER Yes, okay. 

01:22:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Thank you, thank you. So, now I want to make some, uh… sort of overall, uh… remarks about the session. Umm… sort of on the basis of having reflected over it and reviewed and thought and spent some time thinking about, some of the main points earlier in introducing this, the different segments. I talked about the main tasks and I talked about the episodic structure of the session but here I want to talk more about sort of themes that ran across this session for me and the first of these things was, umm… the importance of close empathic tracking. Umm… in his debrief the client talked about how active I was and, umm… the counseling students in, in practitioners when we do, when we show EFT films, often common about how active we are and, umm… some of them are a bit, can be a bit concerned at just how active or they can feel it's, it's not what they're familiar with or unusual. Umm… but, the basically, what I'm doing here, umm… in this session is in spite of the distractions, that I mentioned at the beginning, uh… from the situation, I was in for the most part, I was able to, to reach and maintain a very, sort of close and I think often quite deep empathic tracking. So I'm trying to be immersed in the client's world. This is what I love about doing counseling therapy as it gives me an opportunity to enter the client's world and to be with them and live inside their world for a while and, umm… for me as a human being, this gives me a sense of connection with other people when sort of helps me break out of the kind of loneliness that, that, uh… certainly part of my experience and I think as part of, I believe, as part of human experience in general. So for me, umm… it was really important to be very actively, emphatically engaged with the client, immersed in their experience and doing this close tracking. What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to resonate in my body with the client's experience as it unfolds. I'm trying to work inside their experience with them along another metaphors, I like to work alongside the client's process. It's like the client is in a process with himself, in this case, it was, it was him and his image of his father and I'm along next to it and kind of 90 degree angle to it and I'm working in his process, trying to help his, you know, that his process, interact with itself for the different aspects, for the different dialectally constructive aspects of this process in direct. Umm… and umm… when I do that, umm… the client doesn't even remember what I said. They, all they know, is their process and I can say something, it's not useful, they ignore it, they can't remember what happened, I'll say something, they pick up, they don't even know where it came from. Umm… and so, we kind of are in one process with each other. It's actually very powerful and it's one of my favorite aspects of doing therapy and working as a counselor being able to get to the state and I do believe that in many times, in this session, I was able to, to enter and be in that state with him as we did quite deep work. 

01:25:55
[sil.] 

01:26:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, okay I'll just, umm… I've got my notes. I'll do the next point now. A second kind of overarching theme or idea, I want to pull out of this, umm… this demonstration session, uh… is that, key principle in EFT which is changing emotion with emotion is we say in EFT that you cannot leave an emotion until you fully arrive at the emotion, or you can say, umm… you have to arrive at the emotion before you can leave it. But there has to be an arrival and so the arrival is quite often quite painful. Umm… but then when the client's accessed, uh… core pain in here with his client, a sense of disconnection from his father and that sense of guilt that having let his father down, his father was dying, you know, that, the sort of most painful thing that, the thing that hurts the most then, uh… points to, uh… unmet needs and in the case of the client, the unmet needs were for physical contact, emotional contact and, uh… a kind of, umm… I'm sorry and I kind of, you know giving his blessing to the father, uh… and comforting his father. So these needs, this sort of interrelated needs of emotional and physical contact and, you know, helping his father in his dying process and supporting his father in that kind of way, those needs then point into other emotions and in this case, umm… they were the emotions of compassion and love, I think were the primary transformative emotions. So the client recognize to transform that painful guilt into a sense of primary adaptive care or compassion or love. Umm… and so that was a really important part of his change process. You know, it's really nice illustration of this EFT principle of changing emotion with emotion. 

01:28:00
Learning through reflection 

01:28:05
ROBERT ELLIOT So when I reflect back on my work as a therapist, uh… I always want to reflect on what I've learnt and, umm… the joy of being a therapist or a counselor is to continue to learn new things, uh… in interaction with my client. Umm… and there are at least three, uh… new things that I learnt or experimented within this session in a kind of creative way and, umm… one of them was this idea of sub task that the client comes and he's got this main thing which is the unfinished business but then there is this other thing that's, the other task which here in this case was the puzzlement about why was I such a problematic kid, why was I the one, you know the identified quiet kind of person in my family? Why did I have that role? And so, you know, the idea that there is a kind of underlying sub task, umm… that gets kind of worked, worked out alongside the main task of the session. I think that was really interesting and I haven't really thought that much about that in looking at my work but that was clearly an evidence in this session today. So that was, one thing I learnt. And another thing, umm… that experimented with, there was kind of new was this idea of, uh… what to do with the, umm… umm… with the client who decides to do, uh… a long breathing exercise at the end of the session? What do I do with myself? Umm… and umm… I mean, it's unusual, uh… and it was lovely that the client, uh… did that. Umm… but it left me with feeling like, do I you know if I sit back and don't say anything, do I emotionally disengage from him, umm… or is there some unobtrusive way I can continue to be present the way, after this session? So this idea of using contact reflections, uh… just to kind of provide a bit of presence around his, his breathing, what he did as part of, umm… self-soothing and closing the session was another thing that I experimented with and I learnt, hey, that's an interesting thing to, to try. Uh… and that the other thing that really stands out in my mind is, umm… the holding hands. Now as a male therapist, I don't, umm… I feel like I've got to be very careful with physical contact, umm… and EFT is a body oriented therapy. Uh… it draws from gestalt and, umm… and focusing in other kinds of approaches and it is a body oriented therapy, therapy. So it is appropriate to touch a client at times. But you know, we have to be obviously, very, very careful about how we do it. We need to make sure that it's welcomed, umm… and, umm… so, sometimes that's a, that's a, uh… sort of requires a careful judgment process and in the moment that the client said, you know, umm… he wanted to make contact with his father, umm… it was clear that, that was, that contact needed to be at least partially experienced as physical contact. So, umm… I kind of paused for a minute and thought, you know, is this okay, how is this gonna look, umm… but it felt like, it was the right thing to do. So I put up my hand tentatively to see if that was okay with him, and he grasped it. So one of the things, I saw especially with a male client in this kind of situation, it just felt really, really natural and right for us to, to make that physical contact, for me to enact, umm… his father, umm… in that kind of way. So that was a lovely kind of new experience for me as a therapist to be creative and, umm… to kind of, brought into my practice in that kind of way. 

01:31:50
Concluding remarks 

01:31:55
ROBERT ELLIOT And a final point I want to make about this session, uh… that's kind of, a sort of general point, a kind of take home point, umm… is the mutual nature of the change process. So, umm… you know, EFT, subscribes to, uh… a philosophy of dialectical constructivism which means that, you know, there are two of us in dialogue and together we construct the client's change process. Uh… but one of the characteristics of dialectically constructive process is that, both parties are changed. So in this session, uh… my client obviously experienced shift in a couple of very important, umm… things that have been painful for him. Umm… but I also was, was touched by the work and, you know, there were times in which I allowed myself to be, to resonate with what he was talking about, specific events and during the session, I was, umm… at various points remembering being with my own parents when they were dying and so I was remembering that process of letting go, that I've been through within the last few years with my own parents and I was, remembering, you know, dealing with distance in my other father, uh… and so I was drawn on my own personal experience. I was allowing myself to be touched and that was part of entering deeply into the experience of the client and as a result at the end of the process, it wasn't just the client who was changed by this experience, it was also me.
