THERAPY Talks The Supervision Question: An Essential Tool for Supervision Accountability Lori A. Russell-Chapin 

00:01:55
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Thank you so much for inviting me to talk about clinical supervision. It's been kind of a lifelong journey for me, uhm, it came out of perhaps not a love but sort of a hate relationship that I had with clinical supervision. I'm guessing that may-- maybe many of you might have felt some of the same feelings. Uhm, so I wanna start talking about supervision today by teaching you just, ah, ah, a story teaching you a story. And my guess is all of you know something about this. Uhm, when I was in my doctoral program we have to sign up for those weekly supervisions and, and I was always early cuz I didn't wanna be late and I notice something that every single time someone came out of this pa-- particular professor's office they were sobbing. Tears were just streaming out on their face. And so, the thing I learn from supervision that semester was, do not let this person make you cry. Now, there's something about that, that just didn't seem quite right to me, so I kind of, at that moment said, "I'm, I'm convince that I'm gonna learn something supervision and I'm going to be a better supervisor, and I'm not gonna make people cry unless it's healthy cry." You know, I knew these people were crying cuz they've been criticized. So, I begin to think, "What do you, what do you think we need to do about supervision?" And here's what I think, I think we all carry around sort of a secret box that we have and inside this box. This is my box here, uhm, says, I'm a wild, wacky, wonderful woman who lives here. And inside this box are questions that we really kind of hide from other people. And here's the supervision question that I think we hide from everybody. I wrote it down, and yours may not be quite like mine but I'm guessing it is. Here's what I wrote, "What if I enter into supervision, and my supervisor finds out they don't have a clue what I'm doing?" That's what most of us, I think most of us hide this question in some kind of a treasure box. So, I'm-- I decided that what we need to be doing is change the question that's inside our secret box. So, I'm kinda proposing to all of you that we need to teach our supervisees about the importance of a supervision question and make sure that they have a question, not this question but a question that will help us as supervisors know exactly what we should be doing in supervision. So, that's what I wanna talk about today. We're gonna start first of all with the definition of a supervisions. 

00:04:20
Definition of Supervision A distinctive approach and response to a supervisee's needs from an expert who has more supervision knowledge and experience. 

00:04:20
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Now we know that the definition usually as a, as a distinct approach in response from a su-- for a supervisee, from an expert and I've use that term a little bit loosely. Who has a little more supervision knowledge and expe-- e-- experience than they do. Now, what I think is fascinating about supervision is that for most of us we became supervisors because we've been counselors for a while and we've been there longer than the person that they just hired. In my doctoral program we didn't even have mandated supervision courses yet. Now we're mandating our courses in counseling and on master's program, in a doctoral program and I think all of us are much better for it. But I still think we make this process accountable. I don't think we make it empirically based and I don't think we have enough evidence to talk about supervision. 

00:05:10
The Supervision Question Supervise requesting exactly what is needed from the supervision session in the form of a question. Purpose: • Teach outcome accountability to the supervisee • Emphasize clarify of supervision expectations • Effectively meet supervision needs • Model supervisee responsibility for the supervision outcome 

00:05:10
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN So what I wanna do today, I've given you this definition, now what I wanna do is talk to a little bit about the supervision question. It doesn't-- it has a purpose and it does several things I think for us. The supervision question just tells the supervisee that I expect in every single time to come with the supervision question. And I wanted to be inform over question but I want you to tell me exactly what it is that you're expecting. And it has, as I said, it has a lot of purposes and I think the first purpose is it teaches accountability to the supervisee. You-- the supervisee has to be responsive for the change, it can't come from the supervisor. So, I think what it does is it helps us model well, it gives us expectations and this is the only way I think we can get our supervision needs met is by having the supervision question. So, ah, most of us have this process of supervision and I think this is a pretty generic foundation process. 

00:06:05
The Process of Supervision Six foundation elements (in order): 1. Clarify supervision expectations to build supervisory relationships 2. Explore multicultural background; similarities and differences 3. Listen to the Supervision Question 4. Select an appropriate supervision approach and model 5. Discuss diagnose/conceptualization 6. Analyze supervisory outcome/evaluate HELP SUPPORT ADVICE GUIDANCE ASSISTANCE 

00:06:05
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN But I wanna talk to you about it briefly and you'll where the supervision question comes into play. So, the first thing of course we have to do, is we have to clarify expectations, we-- research shows that over and over that if we know what the expectations are then odds are we're gonna get these things meant. The expectations could be simple like, be sure we're gonna have supervision every week and let's try to be on time, that would be one. The expectations could be, "What do I want from you as a supervisor? What do I want from you as a supervisee?" So we clarify those expectations, I let them know that this process of accountability is, is on their side and I want them to comment each time with the supervision question. I also then begin to explore the multicultural differences I have. It could be gender, it could be age, it could be ethnicity, it could be so many thing, but what are our differences? We get that elephant out of the room, and then, I say, "What is it that you want at the supervision today? Give me you supervision question." They have this articulated question, this is where it becomes really important though I think, if we know what the question is then we then have some hope of knowing which supervision model for us to select. I think so many of us in the past just say, "Well, I'll see the tape and or I'll listen to your talk and we'll get something done." I think they're really is a way to do supervision. The supervision question is asked, I listen carefully as a supervisor and then I begin to think, "Wow! What supervision model should I be selecting?" Now, most of us know because we took supervision courses that they're basically five models of supervision, and so I'm gonna select one of those with in those five models or many different, I suppose, ah, theorist but I'm gonna sel-- select to one of them. After I make-- I listen to the question, I make the selection, then we can do the rest of it. We, uhm, discuss diagnosis, we discuss conceptualization, and then I start the process all over again. So, I analyze the outcome and then we-- I'll see you next week. I do-- I think there's a parallel process between counseling and supervision. And so what we do in counseling is gonna be something very, very similar to what I do in supervision, but this process continues over and over and now my supervisee knows exactly what I expect. So, what I'm, what I'm gonna do today is show you really five different unique supervision questions. As I give you this question I really want you to think to what, I wonder which model I would pick. I've given you-- I'm gonna select the model for you but I wanna tell you why I've selected this model. Uhm, we actually wrote a supervision book in which I do demonstrations of all these different models and I carefully selected these, these supervisees and I wanted them to come from a cross section. So, this question is really an interesting. 

00:08:55
Examples of Supervision Questions Developmental Supervision Model Supervision Question: When my client sabotages the counseling outcome, what additional strategies could I implement? 

00:08:55
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN The question reads, "When my client sabotages the counseling outcome, what additional strategies could I implement?" If you listen carefully to this question I think it's fascinating. It came from a master social worker, this man has been doing therapy for 26 years but the question is a great question. He is looking for introspection, he's looking for a colleague, he's wanting collegial supervision, and so they meet developmental model seem like the best, the absolute best model to choose. We had an incredible counseling supervision. Uhm, I think he got this, ah, de-- a very different place because I forced them into a supervision question and then I knew exactly what he wanted, so there's one example. Here's another example. 

00:09:40
Examples of Supervision Questions Theoretical Specific Supervision Question: How can I expand the effectiveness of my genograms? 

00:09:45
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN This supervisee came to me and here's the question, now this one is pretty easy to understand. "How can I expand the effectiveness of my genograms?" Well, we obviously know we're coming from a theoretical orientation or its discipline specific and I think this one is fascinating, this person saying, "I really wanna know more about this. So, if I know something about genograms I'm gonna be doing supervision from that." Certainly that aspect but here, here comes the rob I guess, which is, "What if I don't know anything about genograms?" 

00:10:15
Lori A. Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:10:15
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, that's not a big issue, cuz all I'm gonna have to do is just refer them on to somebody else or have them come in join us for supervision. This came from, ah, ah, uhm, ah, a student who is about ready to graduate. You can see that, you can see that there's a little different in this question than the first question, but theoretic specific supervision I think is incredibly important, I would have not known, I would had to guess if, if they didn't have the supervision question. Here's another great question. 

00:10:40
Examples of Supervision Question Social Role Supervision Question: I let this client slowly creep into my personal life. How did I let this happen? IMPOSSIBLE 

00:10:45
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uhm, supervisee came to me and said, listen to this question, "I let this client slowly creep into my personal life. How did I let this happen?" I listen to that question and I thought, "What supervision model should I, should I choose?" I mean you can have varied examples of this but this one seem so appropriate for social role model. The social role model says, " I need to put on a hat." And what do I think this client needs, I think they need to be more aware of what's going in a therapy. That's the basic tentative social role. And so what I decided to do is, "Okay, let's talk about process, let's talk about conceptualization, let's talk about personalization." And it was really interesting to me because once we started talking about this specific question the supervisee knew exactly what they needed to do the next time they saw this client. Let me give you another example. Integrated model of supervision, you know, they tend to be a theoretical, uhm, and this is probably one of my favorite approaches but here's the supervision question and it's very different from the other ones I've given you. 

00:11:50
Examples of Supervision Question Integrated/MSM Supervision Question: I don't even know what skills to use when. Where do I even begin? Counselor Interview Rating Form 

00:11:50
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Listen to this one, "I don't even know what skills to use when. Where do I even begin?" This client and-- or this supervisee is saying, "I am lost in the counseling processes." I love that-- it happen to be a she. I love that she was able to say to me, "I'm lost", so I decided, you know, I wanna use an integrated model supervision. This kinda goes back to my original story about sort to heading supervision, uhm, I also didn't like the fact that sometimes students might come to us and they'd say, ah, "I have a tape, it could be digital, it could be, you know, VHS in the olden days. And, uhm, would you show, ah, ah, a part of my tape?" And I'd see 3 minutes of it, and then I gave them an A, B or C on the tape and then after they go. I don't like that, so I decided based upon Allen Ivey's Microcounseling Skills to device the counsel integrating form. Now, this is, this happen a long time ago, 1999. And I developed this, this interview, ah, rating form that you can qualify this digital recording set, you know, watching and you can qualify by, uhm, already doing masterful skills. Is there intention there? And I found what as fascinating by using this kind of, ah, interview rating form was I can, I can really show them what these thing were, what their voids were and what was wrong and could answer this, this supervisee's question. From there, I decided, "Well I've gotta-- I think there's, there's an actual model and I device the supervision model." And, and I been using this for a long time now. I can say I think since 1999. And what I'm finding is that not only is this for beginning counselors but it's really good in supervision and it's really good for supervisors out there in the field as well. I, I want you to begin to get that there's a very different field for this different questions. I have one more question I wanna share with you, uhm, this is-- the model I chose was Interpersonal Process Recall, IPR with Norman Kagan. 

00:13:45
Examples of Supervision Question Interpersonal Process Recall Supervision Question: I seldom let any silence occur in the counseling session. Why can't I let my clients be quite? 

00:13:45
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I don't think most people even say it's a supervision model, I think it's more of an approach, but I love this approach and I think many of us use this approach. And again the question is, "I seldom let any silence occur in the counseling session. Why can't I let my clients be quite?" I love IPR, I knew exactly which model to select because I though this student, this supervisee, and this was a school counselor, she saw so many different students. And this school counselor was, ah, an old client, our old student of mine she just rattled constantly, she never let any kind of question to school. And, uhm, and she was afraid to be quite so I knew what to do and I used all those wonderful questions that IPR originally out of IPR and just ask her, "What's your deepest fear? And what do you think is gonna happen, you know, if you actually stop talking?" And she was wonderfully, wonderfully and I have this on the DVD, she was wonderfully quiet, she got kinda tears in her eyes and she got to the source that, "I'm afraid, I'm afraid that they're gonna find out in my box that I don't know what I'm doing. So if I keep talking, they'll, they'll, they'll maybe not get to that point." So I really think this, this strategy of using a supervision question is just in-- its imperative, I think if we wanna do healthy supervision. 

00:15:10
Take Away Using a Supervision Question ensures that therapeutic outcomes are no longer a questionable possibility but an answerable question! 

00:15:10
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN So, kind of in conclusion what I want you take away from this today is that, I really do believe this statement and I, I want you to kinda listen to this statement again, that what supervision questions do is ensure that our therapeutic outcomes are no longer a questionable possibility but an answerable question. I want you-- I wanna say it again that using a supervision question ensures that therapeutic outcomes are no longer a questionable possibility but an answerable question. Finally, we have a process of making supervision exactly what is design to be. So my call to action today is both professional and personal and let me start with personal. 

00:15:50
Call to Action Personal: Supervision over the Lifespan Professional: Utilize the SQ and make the supervision process more measurable and accountable. 

00:15:55
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I'm a huge fan of lifetime supervision, I believe we should be doing supervision over the lifespan of our career. I'm in supervision now and I love to go in and be a supervisee, uhm, we do it in a group and in our group we have social workers, we have counselors, we have psychologist. So maybe we're all kind of coming out it from a much different prospective but to me I live there and I'm refreshed, I'm rejuvenated and all my years of therapy I have not one time been burned-out. Now, this is a high burned-out rate profession. So, I'm, I'm a huge fan so my kinda call to action is, I want you to personally go and get to supervision if you're not. We've been supervisees, before we've been supervisors for now, for most of us it's so much for me to go back and be a supervisee. So that's my personal call to action. My professional call to action is, I want you to start utilizing supervision question. You don't have to do it exactly as I do it but I really believe having this broad base supervision question allows you to give some stability to the supervision process. It allows you to give some accountability to the supervision process and it really does make us ha-- much more measurable. And if we wanna move in to this evidence based supervision, or empirical based supervision. 

00:17:15
Lori Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:17:15
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I think one of the only way we can do is through a supervision question. Help me, help our supervisees become more accountable, thank you. 

00:17:25
THERAPY Talks 

00:17:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER Lori, that was a great talk. 

00:17:30
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Thank you. 

00:17:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER So, you've kind of change my view, it's-- I'm not supposed to make my supervisee cry. 

00:17:40
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:17:40
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, and maybe if it's-- they're healthy tears, I, I have this great insight, "Yehey! I'm crying cuz I have an insight." When eureka, and they cr-- tears of joy. 

00:17:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER That's what I like to think my supervisees are crying about. 

00:17:50
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh, tears of joy. 

00:17:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER Tears of joy. Uhm, I do know some approaches they try to raise, ah, the supervisee's anxiety but I have always been a big believer in meeting my supervisees where they're at and trying to match my supervision to what they need but I've never done it quite that overtly before - 

00:18:10
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:18:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER - what made you come up with this idea? 

00:18:10
Lori Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:18:10
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN You know, a-- I knew that they just wasn't something right in supervision for me. And so, that's when I started devising my own counse-- the counsel interview rating form and I validated that, got that published first and then I built this microcounseling supervision model and I, I really do like that. I think our faculty like it, I think our students like it, it's a quantifiable method of doing supervision but then that was on 1999, you know what, but it doesn't fit everybody. And so I knew this wasn't the answer, it was a part of the answer. So I began doing some more research and as I got really more thoroughly involve in all those five models. I thought, "You know, what's missing is we need ask them exactly what the supervisor is want and then when I listen to them acutely I can kinda fit, it's like a customized mo-- it's really customization of supervision. And so, that's when I begin to do that and I start to teaching that in my supervision class, and it work it make sense. And, and so, it's sort of evolve along, I suppose to, as I evolved. 

00:19:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER So what do you think then, I, I see some supervisors who they expect their supervisee to adjust whatever their agenda is or their model versus adjusting to the supervisor to the supervisee. What do you think about that debate or those two ways? 

00:19:25
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I understand it, because if I'm good at something, you know, then I'm gonna do my actions in that, that way. But I don't think it meets the needs of the supervisee. And so, I think what I'm calling for is more flexibility from supervision - 

00:19:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:19:40
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN - more su-- flexibility from supervisors. I think that would, that's what's needed. 

00:19:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER Well I, I had to say, it was, ah, loaded question cuz I believe the same thing. 

00:19:50
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Thank you. 

00:19:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER I'm, ah, you know, more of a strength base and so - 

00:19:55
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:19:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER - ah, person, so I believe that part of our expertise is not in reading the minds of the people we work with - 

00:20:00
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:20:00
DR. SHANNON DERMER - but our flexibility to meet with them where they're at. 

00:20:00
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And I think there's nothing wrong and saying to my supervisee, "You know, what a great question and I just don't have that area of expertise." Or, "I just don't have that, that knowledge base, so we can either do it as a team or we can bring in Shannon and she could do it." So, to me that just mix it-- were better role models that way but ask whatever you need and if I can't provide it I'll find someone who can. 

00:20:20
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:20:25
DR. SHANNON DERMER That's great. I was, ah, a little bit fascinated by your, your box, and those questions that we put - 

00:20:25
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:20:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER - in the box that we might be afraid to ask people. And I've actually done some research on the fears of beginning, ah, you know, counselors - 

00:20:35
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:20:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER - and therapist and it was spot on with what you said. They're afraid that people will see them as a fraud - 

00:20:40
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:20:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER - or that, ah, they really don't know what they're doing and someone will find them out. 

00:20:45
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And, you know, I have been doing-- I mean I am actively doing therapy to this day and even after 30 years of therapy I sometimes don't know what I'm doing and I don't-- that's what I think we need to model in supervision. How could we always know what we're doing. And so, I go to supervision and I love my monthly supervision and I do, I come back just thank you. I mean-- and sometimes I don't even take what they say but it's just bouncing those ideas off but I think everybody needs to know that we all that have moments of insecurity, that's-- that makes me sharp as, ah, I think incompetent as a helping professional. 

00:21:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER Yeah, I absolutely agree, ah, now I've been teaching in council education for, ah, I don't know, 15, 16 years but my doctorate was actually in, uhm, in marriage and family therapy - 

00:21:30
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:21:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER - so it was, ah, COAMFTE, you know, American - 

00:21:35
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:21:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER - Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. And in, ah, AAMFT you're actually required to get a supervisor designation. We had to take a course, you had to do a supervision statement - 

00:21:45
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Wonderful. 

00:21:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER - and that you have to get supervision of supervision. 

00:21:50
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:21:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER So I was gonna ask you, what do you think about requiring some kind of designation for everyone who does supervision? 

00:21:55
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, I'm, ah, I'm improve clinical supervisor and, uhm, that's one of my certifications, and I think everybody should have a court-- in the state of Illinois, you know, I love the state of Illinois because they're mandating counselors to have supervision course and to get reissue with their license you have to have some supervision. And, you know, there were lo-- people were just not happy with that but I was silently clapping because I really do think we need to do that and I love supervision as supervision, I teach that in my, my supervision class. Just because we're really proficient at counseling does not mean we're gonna be a good supervisor. It's a whole different skill set. I mean I think we can use those skills from counseling but I really do think that we need to have a specific skills set for supervision. 

00:22:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER Yeah, definitely there's extra layer - 

00:22:40
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:22:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER - of having your responsibly or gate keeping your responsibility for your supervisee as well as, you know, thinking about their clients as well as your process between - 

00:22:50
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh, I know. 

00:22:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER - supervisor and supervisee. 

00:22:55
Lori Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:22:55
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And I think that's why I was so drown to this piece of, how do we help this process along to be more countable? And I think by allowing our students in-- or our supervisees to have the supervision question and have the I think responsibility and the flexibility of saying, "This is what I need", that empowers the whole process. 

00:23:15
DR. SHANNON DERMER Right, so it's not just the supervi-- supervisor that has power it's, it's more collaborative. 

00:23:20
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:23:20
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:23:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER And the supervisee has to take some responsibility for where supervision goes. 

00:23:25
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Exactly, exactly. 

00:23:25
DR. SHANNON DERMER Okay. Good. And what about, uhm, do you ever do life supervision? Do you have any thoughts about life supervision? 

00:23:30
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Ah, all we have the bug in the early and we, we do - 

00:23:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER Sorry they have like a little, ah... 

00:23:35
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Insect. Excuse me, I-- you might wanna try that again. But, uhm, I, I don't like it as well because I think it break some of the process, the flow in counseling. 

00:23:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:23:45
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I also think sometimes then my students rely upon me - 

00:23:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER Uh-huh. 

00:23:50
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN - and I don't-- I want them to rely upon me. I have lot of clients that's saying, "I can hear you." While I'm not gonna therapy with them. And I, you know, I always say, "I'm really sorry." Ah, I don't want my-- necessarily my supervisees to say, "Oh, this is what Dr. Russell-Chapin says we should do." 

00:24:00
DR. SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:24:05
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I want them to have their own experience. I think it's powerful and I think it works. Uhm, and maybe as we're getting used to being a brand new clinician as a really good system but I'd rather have them, you know, and we make mistakes in counseling. We make mistakes in supervision, I rather process that and talk about it and see where we need to go. 

00:24:25
DR. SHANNON DERMER Very good. I've actually never use the, uhm, bug in the ear where they have, uhm, you know, where they can hear you talking - 

00:24:30
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:24:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER - from behind the mirror, the control room or whatever. But I do, do live supervision where they might take a break - 

00:24:35
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:24:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER - or they just get immediate feedback right after - 

00:24:40
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:24:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER - ah, session, but I also think there are great things about doing, ah, what some people called, "Dead supervision". 

00:24:45
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:24:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER Which is happening sometime in space to think - 

00:24:45
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:24:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER - about it or watch a video and then - 

00:24:50
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:24:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER - processing it. 

00:24:50
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, I'm and I'm kinda believer the pros and cons to every approach we - 

00:24:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:24:55
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN - we do, and I think we've got to find something that fits for us. Uhm, I'd like my, you know, and, and out in the real world, not that I don't think academy is the real world but out in the real world, you know, we of-- we often don't have all those lovely resources. And so, I think we need to be able to, to rely upon our own skills and then have the courage to say to someone. Even, you know, it's even also a little more scary to be doing therapy for 30 years like myself and then say to someone, "I'm lost." 

00:25:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:25:20
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN You know, that's a brave thing to admit, but it make sense to me because every client is different. 

00:25:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. And in the consequences of, ah, every case are different - 

00:25:35
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:25:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER - the accountability that we have but, you know, I, I admit it also sometimes I do, you know, lost. 

00:25:40
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I know. 

00:25:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER And it's-- I've always found-- I don't know if you find the same thing that sometimes our students or, or trainees or wowed by our supervision but, uhm, I think it's a little bit easier sometimes to do supervision than it is to be the-- in their in the moment - 

00:25:55
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN All right. 

00:25:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER - with your client. 

00:25:55
Lori Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:25:55
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And, and I think it's-- well and maybe there's-- although there is a huge responsibility being a supervisor I think there's even a more responsibility with therapy and so, I, I understand why they, they think that. And, you know, when ma-- my students will say that sometimes too. You-- to make it look so easy and I say, "I've been doing that for 30 years. 

00:26:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER That's what you do. 

00:26:10
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Ah, you been doing, how many semesters that you'll be doing this?" All four, five. You know, I say, "You too with, with practice, you know, that, that makes a huge differences." 

00:26:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER It does, it does. And before we run out - 

00:26:20
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:26:25
DR. SHANNON DERMER - of time I wanna ask you a little bit about your book here - 

00:26:25
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:26:25
DR. SHANNON DERMER - you take this, and you have - 

00:26:30
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN A DVD. 

00:26:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER - a DVD. 

00:26:30
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:26:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER So - 

00:26:30
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN This is - 

00:26:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER - tell us a little about that. 

00:26:30
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN - this is clinical supervision theory in practice work, uhm, the-- what I did is, kinda what I did in my talk but I, I truly chose, I guess supervisees or actively doing counseling, and I wanted to have a diverse population of, of supervisees. And so what you see in here, uhm, all I think lots of nice things about supervision, the trouble shooting, uhm, the future but in this DVD you actually see my demonstrating all five of those supervision models. 

00:27:00
DR. SHANNON DERMER Wow! 

00:27:00
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And it, it's, it was really fun to do. The transcripts are in here as well. Uhm, what I love about doing that it's sort of, it's sort approved a little bit that the supervision questioning works, selection model works and to see a solution at the end. I mean, at the very end I say, "Why didn't you get out a supervision today?" And they said, "Well, wow! This is what I got out it. Could have I chosen the different model perhaps but I, I really having that specific supervision question and I made a decision to use a supervision model, it just seemed to be a really nice fit." And so that's what this book does and this DVD does. It's probably a nice way to, to let people know about generically, again, about all these different supervision models and just to have someone demonstration supervision is really helpful I think. 

00:27:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER That is, ah, you know, I've seen like, uhm, videos of, uhm, people demonstrating their counseling model - 

00:27:55
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:27:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER - but I actually don't think I've even seen a video of someone demonstrating their supervision model. 

00:28:00
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Supervision model. Yeah. And in this two we also have group supervision cuz how many of us get-- have the luxury of doing individual supervision in their - 

00:28:05
DR. SHANNON DERMER That's true. 

00:28:05
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN - actually in the real world. Again, most of us to group, so there's, ah, a lovely supervision I think have demonstration there, well I'm the supervisee. 

00:28:15
DR. SHANNON DERMER That, oh... 

00:28:15
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And it's so much fun, I, I want people to know that I don't have the answers but I am willing and I know how to get the resources and I'm willing to go out there and find them. 

00:28:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER Well, Lori it's sounds like you are great role model for your supervisees - 

00:28:25
DR. LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Thank you. Thank you.
