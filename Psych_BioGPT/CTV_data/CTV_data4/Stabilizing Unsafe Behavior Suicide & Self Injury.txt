JANINA FISHER Okay, hello. We are here today? to talk about stabilizing unsafe behavior, which is always the bane of the therapist's work, right. We want to heal, we want to help, we want to bring relief, and instead we often have to worry about something as basic as the client's safety. Now if you notice, think back over the years that you've been in practice, how often have you had a client with unsafe behavior who did not have a trauma history? Abuse, neglect, abandonment, separation, foster home experience, all… all kinds of what we now think of as developmental trauma are intertwined and even predict a later history of unsafe behavior. So as Bruce Perry, who is an expert on child trauma says, "The roots of violence related problems, whether they're violence toward ourselves or toward others, can be found in the adaptive responses to threat present during violent experiences." If we experience violence as children, we are more likely to be violent as adults. That's because we have the very same animal defense survival responses as all mammals. We're more adept at crying for help than other species, less able to fight, but we have the same fight response. We can flee. We can learn to, we can instinctively freeze into invisibility. And when all else fails, we can submit or feign death as this possum is doing. Now Bruce Perry goes on to say, "Any deprivation of optimal developmental experiences that leads to underdevelopment of these areas," and by which he means areas of the brain responsible for thinking and for empathy, "will necessarily result in persistence of primitive immature behavioral reactivity and predispose to a violent behavior." So not only is early abuse going to lead to later violence towards self or others, but also deprivation of optimal developmental experiences, meaning secure attachment. And that's because affect tolerance, impulse control, which of course go hand-in-hand are the outcome of secure attachment. And, you know, this really is the… follows from the work of Allan Schore, who has changed our whole notion of attachment as not just socio-emotional, but also involving the brain and the nervous system. Now this is a very, very simple model of the nervous system, very, very important for the treatment of unsafe behavior. And really, most of my clients are familiar with this diagram. I explain to them that they have bodies that are capable of high sympathetic activation, suitable for leaping tall buildings at a single bound, for running from bears, leaping out of the way of a bus. And they have bodies that are capable of very low parasympathetic activation such as you would see in hypothermia and medically-induced coma, uh… in recuperation from surgery or from an accident. And I explained to them that ideally we're not running from bears or surviving accidents and surgeries most of the time. Most of the time, our nervous system fluctuates within what Dan Siegel calls, "The Window of Tolerance", what Pat Ogden calls, "The Optimal Arousal Zone". And when my clients started asking me, so what does that mean? What's a window of tolerance? I found the best way to explain it was to say, that's the zone within which we can think and feel at the same time, at which point they sort of fell silent or looked puzzled. And they said, "Really? Do people think and feel at the same time?" And I said, "Yes, can you believe it?" So that whole idea that we need that widow of tolerance, we need that bandwidth or capacity to think and feel at the same time, utterly foreign to clients with a history of trauma. Now how do we get this nice, spacious, flexible window of tolerance that allows us to tolerate strong impulses, intense emotions as well as tolerate being bored, tired, little bit depressed or sad? We get that ability from our parents. So when we're really, really, really upset as small children, when we're tired, or sick, or sad, or lonely, or bored, someone comes to our aid. Someone picks us up, someone distracts us, cuddles us, uh… makes us laugh, and restores our little nervous systems to that nice optimal arousal. And with repetition, I mean, this is really about building synapses, not just about emotional security. With repetition, over and over again, and parents who foster secure attachment know how hard this work is, we get a child who has that bandwidth that will be so useful in later life. However, with our clients who grow up in threatening environments, in abuse as well as neglect, you know, neglect feels threatening to children and more and more research is telling us that often the insults to attachment are more painful than abuse. What happens if day in, day out your environment is dangerous is that your nervous system starts to accommodate, it starts to learn patterns of chronic high arousal or what we call hyperarousal. Right? So that means that our adrenaline has been pumping, the child has had to be on guard and still is in that action oriented mode. In fact, that's what sympathetic hyperarousal is intended to do. That's its purpose in the human body and in animals, it's meant to drive action. So… So it does. So our clients who are impulsive, who act out, who take terrible risks that make us just shake our heads, they're all driven by sympathetic hyperarousal, as are our clients who are chronically on guard, chronically hyper vigilant, years of therapy don't change a basic mistrust. And… And we often find ourselves thinking, what… what more can I do to prove to this client that I can be trusted? Not realizing that it's the nervous system. Right, we can… we can prove over and over again that we're trustworthy, that is the nervous system letting the client trust. Also, if you have clients who struggle with posttraumatic flooding or emotional flooding, flashbacks, nightmares, overwhelming emotions, all of those are the result of sympathetic hyperarousal, as is self-destructive, aggressive toward others, and addictive behavior. Now let's say that it was not adaptive in a child's world to be constantly on guard, constantly restless, they think about ADHD diagnosis in traumatized children, right, probably the result of chronic hyperarousal. Let's say that in the world your client grew up in, it was safer to be invisible. And so perhaps that client has developed a pattern of chronic hypoarousal symptoms, symptoms that make it very easy to be invisible, make it very easy to be seen, but not heard because the parasympathetic low energy, right, the very opposite of hyperarousal, hypoarousal is about inaction. And so we have clients who feel numb, who feel nothing uh… or may complain about feeling dead inside, but their bodies reflect that it was safer to be an inert object than a object in motion. These are often clients who are consumed with shame and self-loathing or they alternate between hyper and hypoarousal responses. And.. And a lot of our clients who have unsafe behavior are in that category of alternating hyper and hypoarousal symptoms. And a pattern that I see repeatedly is high arousal leading to some type of unsafe behavior whereupon the body then goes into parasympathetic low arousal, making it very difficult then to take stock or to process what just happened. Now, Marty Teicher(ph) says, "It makes sense that the nervous system should adapt because if an individual is born into a malevolent and stress-filled world, it's crucial for his survival to maintain a state of vigilance and suspiciousness that enables him to readily detect danger." And so think about that next time you feel frustrated that a client I always say, you know, this is a client I've gone to the mat for and he/she still doesn't trust me. And it's so helpful to remember, okay, this client had to maintain a state of vigilance that enabled him to readily detect danger, he will need the potential to mobilize an intense flight/fight response and to react aggressively to challenge without undue hesitation. So sometimes, that acting aggressively in response to challenge without a new hesitation leads to aggressive self-injury, sometimes with aggressive behavior toward others. Now let's add another layer of complication. So we have early experiences of trauma and neglect which have predisposed the body and nervous system, predisposed the brain uh… to respond in certain ways. In addition to that, the brain already is biased toward the negative. The negativity bias is a term that is used to reflect the fact that the brain has many more receptors devoted to scanning for danger than scanning for positive stimuli. It processes negative experiences at a faster rate. It encodes negative experiences as memories as a fast… at a faster rate so that our client's positive experiences often fade into the background. Now if we add to the negativity principle, the fact that our client has been traumatized, that is now a client whose brain and body are going to be highly reactive to trauma-related stimuli, highly sensitive. And it's not just going to respond to danger signals that are obvious, like my client who was abused by her grandfather, who then was triggered by all men with gray hair, regardless of age, regardless of… of kindness, gentleness, etcetera, but all kinds of very, very, very subtle things are also going to set off those same danger signals. And I'll just give you some examples from the last week, either in my practice or that of my consultees. Umm… Disappointed expectations, umm… another one, umm… umm… being left behind, this is a woman who I just did some supervision around this morning. She and her sister generally go out together to gamble once a week on a weekend, her sister went without her. Now again, understandably she would be hurt, but it was also a danger signal uh… without resulted in her taking a small overdose in the… that same evening. So times of day, all kinds of stimuli. I remember several years ago, I did a workshop for adolescence in the State of Massachusetts in residential care. So again, disturbed adolescence in residential programs with trauma histories who came together for the equivalent of an in-service training for clients. It was quite a remarkable project and very, very heartwarming. And one of the things I had them do was to break into small groups and make lists of things that triggered them. And the lists was, were fascinating. I remember on one of the lists, snow, umm… the smell of cigarette smoke, another young man wrote being with, around my family uh… and not being around my family. Umm… Another one wrote, winter time. Another one wrote, umm… hearing people laugh, hearing loud voices. So again, things that we might expect, but many things that we wouldn't necessarily expect. And the problem which is so important here is that when our clients are triggered, the internal experience is, I'm in danger, I'm not safe, not just, I'm hurt, I'm disappointed, but I'm in danger. Now the… what gets triggered, of course, is not a scene, for example, of being disappointed at age five or being beaten at age six. What gets triggered are what are called implicit memories, meaning emotional and physical states that are components of an event that occurred and remember that when we're children, up until the age of probably 8, 9, 10, children largely remember experiences implicitly, uh… which is why my granddaughter used to be able to say, I would say, this was really up until she was 8. I would say, "How was your day at school?" And she'd say, "Oh, it was great." And then I'd say, "Well, what did you do?" "Uh, I don't remember." And I could take her back, I could say, "Well, you know, when you first come into your class, what do you usually do?" But she was spontaneously remembering with her feelings, not with her narrative memory. So what happens is that our clients suddenly feel overwhelming emotions. They feel desperate, they feel despairing, they feel shame, they feel rage, they feel hopelessness, or they start to experience different types of fear states, hyper vigilance, panic, posttraumatic paranoia meaning somebody's out to get me. They may have really inexplicable body sensations that would fit with a traumatic event. I've had a lot of clients recently struggling with dizziness, tightness in the chest, often mistaken for heart, you know, an impending heart attack, nausea, another one that I know therapists experience often. Or impulses, I mean, we've all had the experience, probably, of clients who suddenly jump up in the middle of a session and say, "I have to get out of there." Right? That's memory because they are in fact safe, even though the brain and body are telling them differently. Now, one of the types of implicit memory that we have, in the trauma field have become interested in is what's called procedural learning, meaning memory for habit. So what happens is that starting very, very, very young, children are forced to depend on the limited resources they have to soothe themselves, to regulate their emotions, to regulate their behavior. Even in infancy, babies really have only two choices. They can shutdown and they can dissociate. As kids get a little older, in the preschool years, they have access to food, and I… I tell my clients who struggle with overeating disorders that food is the first drug to which children have access. Masturbation often is another drug of choice in the very early years. As children move into latency, they have many more options. I have a client who remembers at age six, for the first time, wanting to go to heaven because that seemed like a much, much better place than the world she lived in. But we see, with even young children, and we see suicide attempts, again often not terribly successful, perhaps grownups wouldn't see these things as suicide attempts. Throwing oneself down a flight of stairs, for example, all kinds of behavior, aggressive behavior toward other kids, all trying desperately to regulate the nervous system. And then in adolescence, of course, there is a whole world of drugs available for adolescence and more sophisticated ways of hurting themselves. So, little children can't hurt themselves, but they might find that pinching or digging their nails in helps to regulate their feelings. Here are some examples, here are in the words of clients, Jan remembering terrible, terrible abuse she suffered at the age of five when she was kidnapped by her father and… and luckily, this was an experience that only lasted for nine months. She says, "Every day I would say to myself, if I just get through today, I can die tomorrow. I got through each day by promising myself I could die the next day." Right, and imagine a five-year-old, day after day, okay, I did it, I got through today, tomorrow I can die. Annie remembers as a housewife in her 40s, she says, "I would cut myself to get off the floor of the closet and go downstairs and make dinner for my family." Flooded with traumatic memories, she didn't understand why she was hiding in the closet. In later years, of course, when she came to therapy with me, uh… we could see that as a memory, right, a behavioral memory, when your body sounds those alarm signals, run and hide in the closet. Anita who was an alcoholic recalls being hospitalized at age 13 for what doctors called psychosis. I suspect it was flooding of memory flashbacks and images that were treated as hallucinations. She says, "After I got out of the hospital, I went to a party and had my first beer, and I thought, if I have beer, maybe I won't ever have to go back to that hospital again." And then Peter, now a 50-year-old elected public official says, "I survived as a kid by locking myself in my room and eating and masturbating until I got numb." So very, very early in childhood, these clients learned how to use what we would consider self-destructive behavior just to survive. So in this model, we see self-destructive behavior as what was once a survival strategy driven by the animal defenses of fight and flight and in response to triggers. And the difficultly is that like substances, all self-destructive behavior has the same challenge of tolerance, meaning that a little bit at the beginning brings relief, and then over time the individual needs more and more to be able to get the same effect. And so eventually, we have clients whose trauma we want to treat, who perhaps have come to us because they're depressed, because they have not dealt with their early abuse and we end up having to just try to keep them safe, we can't even get at the trauma. What helps in using this model is the ability to address the relationship between the trauma and the substance abuse, so that we are treating both at the same time in a way that stabilizes both. Now the key here, though, is as you know, I don't have to tell any of you, that we have to help people, have a way to address their feelings and impulses before they act. I certainly, in my 33 years of practice, I have spent so much time with clients debriefing after the fact, but we need a model that is neurobiologically founded that can help us to help the client prevent those moments of impulse. Now, I forgot a very, very important detail that is key to all of this. When we're in either hyper or hpyoarousal, the frontal lobe shut down and it's a fascinating thing. We're designed so that as the adrenaline activates the sympathetic nervous system and we prepare to take action, our frontal lobes shut down so that we can respond more instinctively. Similarly, in parasympathetic hypoarousal, the frontal lobes shut down. I remember, years and years ago, I had surgery and I thought, "Okay, well, I can… I can manage this recuperation 'cause I'll get a lot of reading done, I'll get a lot of work done." I… I couldn't read. My frontal lobes were shutdown. So, we need a model that helps get those frontal lobes online, we have to help people to manage the nervous system, to manage triggers and if this treatment model is going to be half as effective as self-destructive behavior, it has to be simple and repetitive and it has to be mindful because two things happened when used mindfulness based techniques. One is that mindfulness based techniques activate the prefrontal cortex, actually this part right here, the medial prefrontal cortex and regulates the nervous system. Right, so when this goes on, the nervous system gets a signal to regulate. When the frontal lobes go off, the nervous system gets a regulate… a message to act and react at will. The other thing about mindfulness based interventions is they change our relationship to our feelings and impulses. I remember very clearly, this is going back 25 years to my experience working at, in a hospital based psychiatric clinic. And… And I can remember the clients who came in saying things like, "I deserve to die," umm… in response to their cutting, "Well, I'm punishing myself." That… Those words spoke to their relationship to the self-destructive behavior. Right. So the meaning that they're making of the self-destructive behavior actually fed more self-destructive behavior. If I help the client change the relationship to the behavior, even to have the client begin to label it as a survival strategy, that's going to change the degree to which that behavior is reinforced versus diminished. So the other thing that this is often… You know, it's funny how, if you've been around a long time, many of the concepts remain the same, but the terminology has changed. This is what used to be called observing ego prior to the neurobiological era. It's now called dual awareness, and it is the best technique the brain has for managing both impulses that arise below the level of words, but also it's the best technique we have for distorted cognitions, right, which usually go hand-in-hand with trauma and with unsafe behavior. So in dual awareness what happens is that this medial prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that's associated with mindfulness, meditation, this part of the brain notices the feelings and impulses and automatic thoughts and body sensations which arise from lower levels of the brain or from the right brain. And we again, we know from brain scan research that there's a modulating or soothing effect. So we want to cultivate dual awareness, so that instead of the client saying, "I have this impulse, I just want to hit myself," I can teach the client to notice the impulse. Because when you have the impulse, it's more likely that the next thing is an action. If we're noticing the impulse, it buys us a little time. So there is a model, so my approach to unsafe behavior which has been in the making literally for almost 30 years, probably really since that Cambridge Hospital experience where the major proportion of our clients were in fact either addicted or engaging in unsafe behavior. I've been looking for a model that would really address unsafe behavior at a level that would be effective. And as you know, there have been many, many, many models over the years, I've probably used them all myself, I'm sure you have as well. But here's a model that is relatively little known in the U.S., but very, very well-known in Europe and it actually combines the neurobiological understanding of trauma with dual awareness and it also has the advantage of being able to deal with dissociative symptoms which, research has shown, dissociative symptoms occur at a very, very high rate in clients diagnosed with borderline personality. So, it really covers all of the bases that we want to cover. And it comes out of this idea best described by Judy Herman, "When neither resistance nor escape is possible, the human system of self-defense becomes overwhelmed and disorganized." Each component of the ordinary response to danger, right, that's fight, flight, freeze, submit, attach, umm… or cry for help, having lost its utility tends to persist in an altered and exaggerated state long after the actual danger is over. So what she's saying is when the fight, flight, freeze, submit, and cry for help responses don't work as in neglect and abuse and in wartime and in domestic violence, right, many, many contexts, prisoners of war, those responses persist in an altered and exaggerated state long after the actual danger is over. Meaning, they take on a life of their own, they're no longer responses in the moment to a threat. They're responses that occur continually in, umm… in the context of triggers. So, the theory says that the brain is, we're… we're born, we're born with brains that are designed to compartmentalize that this is not just a bizarre feature of dissociative disorders, but actually the human brain is meant to have that ability to be more or less integrated versus compartmentalized. And in fact, you know, we're born as right brained creatures. Umm… That's part of what makes children so delightful is that they are little right brains, umm… right. The right brain is our less verbal brain, it's the survival brain, the artistic brain, the playful brain. And as Louis Cozolino says, "Our right brains hold a sense of a corporeal and emotional self." So who we are on the right brain is a physical and emotional feeling. The right brain is the perfect brain for the first part of childhood because it relies on the visual, on the gestalt, on intuition. It reads body language and facial expression, which is why it's so useful in survival. And again, it's the dominant part of the brain during early childhood. In children, the left brain grows very, very, very slowly through the course of childhood and, you know, it has a growth spurt around the time that kids learn language. But again, it is a slower growing brain that doesn't become dominant. I mean, we all know, think about teenagers, they have more capacity to use the left brain but don't always use it. "The left brain," Cozolino says, "is the home of our conscious linguistic self." Right, so that when people say, what do you do? Who are you? Right, we answer often from that conscious linguistic self-side rather than our corporeal and emotional self. The left brain is our rational, analytical, linear, organizational brain. Now here's another interesting thing. The way that the right brain and left brain talk to each other is via a part of the brain called the corpus callosum that basically, right, is right along this divide. However, the corpus callosum doesn't mature until we are 25… Sorry, we are 12 or more. So that means until the age of 12, 13, the right brain and the left brain are growing up without a lot of communication. In addition to that, Martin Teicher(ph) at McLean Hospital in Massachusetts has found doing brain scan research with abused and neglected children in adolescence, that they on average have a smaller corpus callosum. So again, think about the implications of this. The right brain and the left brain don't communicate and the result of that is that this rational, management side of the brain cannot necessarily manage the impulses of the right brain. So this theory underlies or actually these neurobiological findings, I should say, underlie the theory of structural dissociation. This, by the way, is the theory of Onno van der Hart, Ellert Nijenhuis and Kathy Steele, the two first authors, the first and second author are from the Netherlands, Kathy Steele from the U.S. And the theory says, "At whatever age we are first traumatized, we have a pre-traumatic personality that begins undivided, and then that trauma happens and the result is that we have a split between the left brain part of the personality that becomes the part of us that goes on with normal life. So that's the… the part of all of us that picks ourselves up, dusts ourselves off, and tries to go on. While the right brain part of the personality called the emotional part, holds the non-verbal physical and emotional memories and survival responses, and that right brain side of the personality remains on guard, remains ready, primed, uh… scanning for the next bad thing to happen. Now the theory says, this is the structure that results from a single incident trauma and I heard the perfect example of this while I was waiting in line to pay for a haircut of all things, and the woman in front of me was saying to the cashier, "You know, the police keep asking me what happened, and I can't tell them. I don't remember. I don't know why they don't accept that." And she described an auto accident in which she had been on her way to work, right, which would be the, uh… obviously in her case it would be the pre-traumatic personality. Stopped at a red light and the next thing she knew, she was waking up in an ambulance where she was being examined. Someone had hit her from behind. So she said, you know, "Nothing wrong, the only problem is I don't remember what happened, but thank goodness nothing broken, car totaled, but I'm fine." "However," she said, "that it's been very hard for me to get in a car ever since." She described that each time she would try to drive the car, she would feel her hands start to shake. So, there's our emotional part of the personality, the apparently normal part says, "I'm fine, what's the problem? I'm gonna go back to work." And then emotional part of the personality umm… holds the memory that driving is dangerous and she starts to tremble and shake and feel the panic and just want to run out of the car. Now this is structural dissociation. I… This is the language of structural dissociation, I should say. The left brain side named the apparently normal part, the right brain, the emotional part. I don't like that language with apologies to the authors. I prefer to call the left brain part of the personality the going-on-with-normal-life self because what it does is to really celebrate that having that impulse to go on with normal life no matter what, to keep on keeping on, that's not a false self, right. That's actually a very, very courageous action. And I found it helpful for my clients to call the right brain part of the personality the traumatized part, so that I could help the going-on-with-normal-life part to be a mindful observer of the traumatized part to build a relationship. Now what do we mean by a part of the personality? This is a very controversial word. Sometimes I joke with my clients, I call it the P word because they say, "Well, I'm not Sybil" and I say, "I know, I know you're not Sybil." But you know, we all have parts and I joke with them, I say, "I'm sure you've noticed that I have parts." And then they go, "Oh, yes." And… And it's very funny because, of course, they're hyper vigilantly observing us and they do see different sides of us. What we mean in using this language is we mean what Hebb once called "neurons that fire together wire together," meaning if the same neural pathways fire over and over and over again, those neural pathways become a system. And as Allan Shore says, "Those neural systems which are autonomic, affective, somatic, and cognitive, result in enduring traits." And so think of a part of the personality as a neural system that is connected to a pattern of autonomic arousal, emotional responsiveness or lack thereof, umm… somatic responses, cognitive responses. And Cozolino really supports this whole concept that… that who we are on the left side of the brain is different than who we are on the right side of the brain. He says, "The left hemisphere functions best within the middle range of affect and is biased toward positive and prosocial emotions." So, for example, the left hemisphere would be more likely to feel frustration than rage, more likely to feel signal anxiety or facilitating anxiety rather than panic. "Strong affect," he says, "especially anxiety and terror appear to inhibit left hemisphere functions of language and logic." Right. We see this all the time. "Hence the experience of stage fright and speechless terror." And I would add and impulsive behavior that even five minutes ago, the client might have said, "I don't want to do that." And it's happening. The right hemisphere is generally responsible for both appraising safety and danger and organizing the sense of the corporeal and emotional self. The only problem is, remember that you… It's hard to appraise safety when your negativity bias has been further biased by trauma. It becomes automatic to appraise danger. Now the theory, excuse me while I get my water here, this theory goes on to say that with repeated traumatic threat, not just events, but traumatic threat, more compartmentalization is going to be necessary and this is the compartmentalization that occurs, that we see in borderline personality disorder, in many of the bipolar patients who are being diagnosed these days, umm… also in children, oppositional disorders and also in mild to moderate dissociative disorder, not otherwise specified, also complex PTSD, which is the term given to clients often with childhood abuse. And now notice what's happened here. Now the going-on-with-normal-life self and the traumatized part have split, but there is now more splitting on the right brain side, but not as we might have read about in… in books on dissociative identity disorder, The compartmentalization is all related to the survival responses that are a child's only, really only alternative if they… if secure attachment is missing. So, a part or parts of the self develop that hold the fight response, a part or parts driven by the flight response, a part or parts driven by fear and freezing, or by submission and compliance responses and the attach for survival, different from healthy attachment, because the attach for survival response is seen in clinging and separation anxiety and difficulty in being soothed. You can see how this really fits with borderline personality disorder. And, you know, so typically, I'm actually gonna, I'll tell you the story of a… of a client whom I assessed a number of years ago. Umm… I'll call her, what shall I call her? I'll call her Eleanor. Umm… And Eleanor came in looking very, really remarkably healthy for the trauma she'd been through with a strong going-on-with-normal-life self. And… And as always, I explained to her, as I explain to all new clients, I say, you know, you may not want to work with me given my travel schedule and limited availability for extra support, for crises, and I want to make sure you have what you need. And she said, "Not a problem. I have been looking after myself for years, I can cope and I can manage my feelings between sessions." Well, in slightly less than three weeks, I started to get frantic calls, "Dr. Fisher, please, please, call me, please." That didn't seem to carry any remembrance of this conversation about my availability. And then often, those messages would be followed by a message uh… with rage and venom, "Dr. Fisher, what kind of therapist doesn't return a phone call?" Followed by, "I'm not coming, that's it. I'm done with therapy." Followed by, of course, as we, many of us have learned to do, umm… she would come and I certainly wouldn't cancel the appointment umm… and… and say, "I'm sorry I'm so difficult. Please don't give up on me." Which I understood as the submit part. And all of it probably generated by something that had triggered the freeze part. So each part has a different defensive strategy. The going-on-with-normal-life part is the part of your client that wants to function. Whether her or she can, if it's somebody who functions, often that's someone holding on desperately to that functioning. On the other side, we have the freeze part who presents with all types of anxiety symptoms and the defensive strategy, of course, of freeze is alarm, right. That's the part of all of us that… that sends that signal to the body that danger is there. The attach part survival strategy is vulnerability and help seeking. Umm… Submit is shame, self-loathing, passivity, depression, hopelessness, helplessness, flight, distancing, whether through physical distancing or distancing by means of addictive behavior, eating disorders and so on. And then fight has the defensive strategy of control, whether through anger, aggression towards self, aggression toward others, hyper vigilance, all of those fall under the fight response. And the key here is that decades after the trauma, as Pat Ogden writes, "What began as a necessary defense in the face of a real threat has become a pervasive, unrelenting reaction to the anticipation of a threat." Marty Teicher(ph) says, "the animal defense survival responses markedly augment the individual's capacity to rapidly and dramatically shift into an intense aggressive state when threatened by danger or loss." And that's very, very key because as I have been, I've now worked with two psychiatric hospitals using this model and we have tracked the precipitants to unsafe behavior. Again, this is… this is unsafe behavior in a hospital setting, and what have found is the precipitant for most unsafe behavior is a loss, meaning a hurt, a disappointment, umm… having someone cancelled a visit or an appointment, umm… separation, even for a short time from somebody important. Now we have to understand unsafe behavior as the province of the fight and flight parts in response to disappointment, hurt and other wounds to the cry for help or attach part because, and now why would that be? Because attachment is dangerous when we have dangerous caretakers. Right, that's the bottom line, right. Attachment is only safe when we have safe caretakers. And so what you will see in the therapy is different ways of protecting that attach part from hurt. Right, whether it's through flight and again, the… the woman who I consult… Whose case I consulted to this morning, right, she was disappointed because she was left out, right, a wound to her attach part. And so she decided to do some recreational substance use uh… followed by self-harm in the form of a small overdose which increased the feelings of control over her emotions. Also, the… her fight part, one of her other fight parts tried to get into a fight with this very disappointing person uh… and in this case, she did not become suicidal and this was something… Her therapist has done a beautiful job at differentiating overdoses for the purpose of controlling emotions versus overdoses which are intended to be lethal. And this is a client who has done both. But having that differentiation is extremely helpful and… and one that has really helped the client to be more stable. Now umm… under stress, the compartmentalization often becomes more pronounced making it harder to control one's impulses, right. That is the other piece of bad news. And so what we see are problems of safety, are problems with identity, right. These are clients who often have very negative self-images, a lot of shame, a lot of hopelessness. Therapy destructive behavior, I don't need to tell all of you about that, wonderful term that comes from Marsha Linehan umm… which I found extremely liberating and umm… under that includes devaluing the therapist, excessive demands on therapist's time and energy, resistance to treatment, right. Help me, no, I won't do that, no I won't consider that. Lack of integration, umm… meaning that these are clients who may have good sessions, but don't seem to be able to take something away that they can use, and then of course, it goes without saying, uh… difficulty regulating their autonomic arousal and therefore their emotions. So let me go on, I'm going to talk about how to use this model. The key here is that if we want to stabilize unsafe behavior, we have to help the client resolve conflicts between these competing animal defenses. We have to help the client expand the window of tolerance, right, to have more tolerance for hyper and hypoarousal states, for emotions. Umm… Simple starting with often very simple, more cognitive activities. Uh… This is what I call 10% solutions umm… and I… and I developed the title because I had clients who I would teach some intervention like breathing to calm anxiety and they'd come back and they'd say, "Well, that didn't help." And I learned to say, "Well, did it help 10%, 5%, 20%?" "Oh, it probably helped 10%." "Okay, so then if we want a 100% relief, we're gonna have to have 10… 10% solutions." And we would use therapy time or it could be homework, I would ask them to start to notice anything, any activity whatsoever that helped 10%. And to… And we would create lists and then the more relief they wanted, the more 10% solutions they needed to use. We can also regulate autonomic activation using the body. So, I myself prefer now sighing rather than breathing because I find that when sometimes, when trauma survivors try to breathe in, they… they end up going, uh… huh… and that triggers more fear, huh, whereas the sigh automatically results in an in breath. Remember that if you are teaching breathing, the longer the out breath, the more parasympathetic relaxation, so if we're working on lowering anxiety. Grounding, right, feeling the floor under one's feet, pushing down against the floor. One of my very favorites for high activation is the hand on the heart, right. If you think about babies being put over the mother's heart, that's the first greeting of newborns and mothers. For depressed and hopeless clients, right, who tend to collapse, lengthening the spine, umm… orienting to the environment, right. If we know where we are, umm… oftentimes, it's like, oh, yeah, you know, I never saw that… that picture on your wall before. Umm… Standing up, I've learned to become comfortable having people stand up and move around. And… And… And even defensive movements, for people who have trouble saying no, for example, umm… what happens if they make this movement, which is the universal move, sign for stop. As Feldenkrais says, "In order to do what you want, you have to know what you're doing." And, you know, of all the hundreds of clients with unsafe behavior that I've treated over the years, all of them have wanted to be more stable, but they either found they didn't know how or found that their attempts to engage in safer behavior didn't work. So the key here is curiosity first, intervention second because again, if the key to safety is activating the prefrontal cortex, helping clients to notice relationships between triggers and reactions, increasing their awareness of the different parts, all of that, right, is going to calm the nervous system, decrease the chances of unsafe behavior without our having to do a formal intervention. Help clients build curiosity. You know, curiosity is the secret weapon of the therapist. It's a precursor to mindfulness, it's part of mindfulness, meditation, interest, and it's usually nonthreatening to most clients. And then focusing on the relationship between unsafe or impulsive behavior and the parts because that fosters dual awareness. So, the language of mindful dual awareness is the language of noticing, right. Notice what feelings are coming up. You know, I'm noticing a lot of times I have clients who can't notice. They're just too internally stimulated, and so I start to be the noticer in the room. I'm noticing that talking about this is a little triggering for you, you know, should we just pause for a moment? Let's be curious about that reaction, right. That's so… And, you know, the more unsafe the behavior, the more bizarre, the more I get excited. Wow, this is so interesting. This is amazing. Let's be curious about this because this is an amazing thing, right. So, when you have that thought, I'm a loser, whose voice are you hearing? Is it the voice of the judgmental, critical part or is it the voice of the part that feels judged? One of my favorite questions when people have acted out, did you notice any early warning signs that something was going to happen? Psychoeducation, very, very simple. You know, I was a postdoctoral fellow in Judith Herman's clinic back in the early '90s and she, as a feminist as well as a trauma expert and psychiatrist, she believed that we needed to empower our clients by teaching them what we knew about trauma. She said, "You know, that equalizes the relationship and in addition to that, it also gives the client some reassurance that he or she is not crazy." Right, so teach the window of tolerance diagram, the hyper and hypoarousal responses, the connection between triggers and overwhelming feelings or impulses. And I would suggest, I didn't… Don't have with me right now, but on my website you'll see a, umm… under the resources section, I have a psychoeducational flip chart which gives very simple diagrams, many similar to what you've seen here that explain the very same concepts that you've heard. And, in fact, I've just got an email this week from a client saying, "Thank you so much. The flip chart is so reassuring to me. I'm wondering if you could publish it in a purse size so that we clients could carry it with us." Normalize the suicidality, self-harm, self-destructiveness uh… in terms of what it does for the nervous system. And… And I think one of the keys is labeling symptoms as symptoms. Yeah. When people say, "You know, I have no hope for the future," I say, "Yeah, you know, that's one of the symptoms of PTSD is the loss of a sense of the future." So I have just challenged their belief that they have no future simply by giving them information. Track the relationship between aggressive behavior and arousal. Again, this diagram is in the flip chart, but you can also just draw two lines on a piece of paper and teach it to the client. So this is a client with whom I have been tracking the impulsive behavior using the window of tolerance diagram. So in this case, by the way, this is somebody who is in a state hospital, so she had been hospitalized for about a year-and-a-half for… for cutting and other kinds of self-harm and suicidality. So she said, "Well, I just came, you know, I came back from my… to my room from a walk, I felt pretty okay." So she noticed she was in the window of tolerance "And then one of the nurses came in to tell me that I'm not getting my privileges." And we tracked that her arousal spiked. And then she says, "I was pissed. You can't count on anyone. Face it." You can hear the voice of the fight part in there, uh… right. And then that thought sustained her arousal. So I said, "When you felt that you can't count on anyone, did your arousal go up or down?" She said, "It went up." "Okay." "I yelled at the nurse and then I felt a little better. My arousal went down a little bit, yelling at the messenger, but then I started thinking about it again. I've been working so hard, nobody around here believes me. They just want to keep me trapped." You know, you can see the escalation of the arousal. "Okay, what happened next?" "And then I cut myself and I felt better." "Uh-huh. So when the arousal was going up and up and up and up and the thoughts were getting more and more upsetting, uh… you had this impulse to cut. And then what happened?" uh, And then, she says, "And then I just wanted to sleep. I know I'm in trouble, but I don't care." So again, she went into hypoarousal after… after she cut herself. And the key question that I ask clients like her, which is so very, very important for helping to challenge without struggling, right, I think the biggest danger we can get in with clients is that we end up in a struggle in which we're arguing for safety and they're arguing for unsafe behavior. So I ask them, first I validate the relief and then I say, "And how long did the relief last? Right, how long does it last?" And that's the point that they usually have a little wake up call, but it's their own wakeup call rather than one that I've confronted them with. And I've had clients who said, "Oh, gosh, the relief maybe lasts half an hour, 20 minutes, not very long." And I just say, and I say, "Yeah, you know, over time it lasts less and less and less long, which is too bad, huh?" Because again, if I validate it, it's going to actually give them more impetus to think about it than if I then say, "Well, it's not worth it because it doesn't last very long." We can use psychoeducation on the structural dissociation model, another very, very important. Umm… The key to keeping the client mindfully aware is the language of parts and that means translating. When the client says, "I feel ashamed," I say, "Huh, so a part of you feels ashamed." You know, "It was all my fault." Umm… yeah, so there's a part that thinks it was her fault. And so I just, I don't know, I just want to hurt myself. Yeah, so notice there's a part that wants to hurt yourself to make the feelings go away. Now the language of part… What the language of parts does and I hope you can hear that is it puts the client into relationship with the feeling, thought, or behavior, right. So when she said, "Oh, I feel so ashamed." That's not, right, there's no dual awareness there. If I say, "Notice that feeling of shame, right, and notice that there's a part of you that's feeling very ashamed. Can you notice that part?" Here's a… Here's a… Here's a Snoopy's version. "My body blames my foot for not being able to go places. My foot says it was my head's fault, and my head blames my eyes. My eyes say my feet are clumsy and my right foot says not to blame him for what my left foot did. I don't say anything, because I don't want to get involved." And that's so often what's happened with our clients is that unbeknownst to them, the going-on-with-normal-life self has been practicing a pattern of uninvolvement that has allowed the self-destructive parts to act and react at will. Now one thing to know is that although back, probably even 10 years ago, it was believed that if we use the language of parts, we would promote fragmentation, that we'd cause iatrogenic worsening, we now know that actually the reverse is true. As Dan Siegel says, "Integration requires differentiation and linkage." So if I want to integrate, right, if I'm the client and I want to integrate my left brain conviction that self-harm and suicidality is taking me to a bad and increasingly worst place, if I want to integrate that thought with the impulses, I have to be able to differentiate the two, the belief from the impulse, and in some way link them. When we reframe self-destructive behavior as a part for the personality, we help the client take responsibility for it, right. So, that's very, very, very important. So here's an example. This is the same client umm… who, as you can see, struggled with cutting. This was a different event. She says… So I've been told by the nurses that she's cut the night before and I come in and I try to say it lightly, "I hear you cut last night. Wow, you haven't cut in a long time. What… What part of you do you think it was?" Now the answer you're gonna get is, I don't know. That's what I find is that in this population, most of the time the first answer to what I ask if I'm looking for mindfulness, curiosity, and dual awareness is I don't know. She says, "I don't know. I just hate myself." And I say, "Well, let's think about this. Who would it have been that cut? Was it flight, was it fight?" And she says, and I'm showing her the diagram, which again, is in the flip chart. So I've got my flip chart out and I'm showing it to her. And she says, "Well, I guess it was fight." "Uh-huh! So was fight upset about the phone call?" The night before, her boyfriend was supposed to call her and he hadn't. "Or was the fight part just trying to protect you?" And she says, "Fight always tries to protect me, I always have this mistrust." And I said, "Okay, so you want to trust people, but the fight part wants you to mistrust them?" And she said, "Yeah, fight always thinks I'm a fool for trusting my boyfriend." And I go on, "Okay, so if fight had its way, you wouldn't trust anyone, huh?" And she says, "Yeah, it's safer that way, then you don't get hurt." And I hear that as the voice of the fight part, right. So I say, "So fight keeps trying to protect you that way by saying don't trust, you won't get hurt that way." And she says, "Yeah, but it backfires because then I can't get help." Very true, because she had not only made a number of suicide attempts, many very severe episodes of self-harm, but also had attacked staff aggressively. "Well, maybe you could work with the fight part and help it see that you're an adult now who actually can tell whom to trust," which was very true about her. In her going-on-with-normal-life part, she had a really, really good ability to size people up. And she says, "Well, I can't kick my fight part to the curb though, it saved me." And I say, "Yes, absolutely, everybody needs a fight part. So hold on to that fight part. It gives us courage, it gives us backbone, gives us the ability to stand our ground, but we need our fight parts to let us decide who we're to trust and how to react." And she said, "Well, you know, I do trust a lot of people here." You know, this model, she was actually the… the sort of the… the pilot study of this model. Umm… And… And she continues to do so well as long as she has a therapist who is familiar with the model. So, each time I name an emotion or impulse as a part, and anything resembling adult or thoughtful behavior as the going-on-with-normal-life part, I am painting a picture of the whole, right. This again is… is… is a combat fragmentation rather than causing fragmentation. So, you know, so I say to the client, "I can see there's a part here today that doesn't trust me as far as he can throw me, who is saying "talk to the hand," but I know there's another part in you that really wants to work with me, that wants to have a life outside this hospital." Right, so and one of the things that I love about it is this language allows me to talk about the part that doesn't trust me without shaming the client as I might have if I had said, "You know, I can see that you don't really trust me today" could be a very shaming statement because there is that part of the client that's been trying so hard to trust me. Another thing that really aids in mindfulness and problem-solving is externalizing these parts. And it's quite an extraordinary thing. This was… This… By the way, all of these… these little rubber ducks have been donated to me by clients uh… and the original set with all those little tiny devil ducks which were given to me by a very, very suicidal, self-destructive patient after I taught her about the parts model. And she came in and dumped the little ducks on the coffee table and she said, "These are the parts." And I had been talking about their going-on-with-normal-life part having this big brain, so she brought in that plastic brain, that rubber brain to represent her going-on-with-normal-life self. And right here, this… this particular constellation of ducks were actually looking at umm… how the ducks participated in a series of date rapes that had occurred. So these ducks are often very… you know, any object that you can find, little toy animals, I had a… a colleague who used her business cards to represent the different parts. And she and the client spread them out on a coffee table and… and rearrange them in various configurations. Heighten the client's curiosity and by reframing the self-destructive behavior as the effort of a part trying to help. Right, or if you're not comfortable with the parts language as the body and nervous system trying to help, so the other way, the other language that works is to talk about the right brain part of the personality as the… as the body and umm… and the left brain part of the personality as the mind or the brain. So I could say, "You know, I know that your brain wants safety and stability and a normal life, but I don't think your body has quite caught up with that. So how is your body trying to help in cutting or running or… or hitting your head?" Umm… Reframe the relationship between the trauma history and the self-destructive behavior. Reframing builds trust and safety. Remember that these are clients who've been subjected to very, very harsh and negative feedback. When we're curious about the adaptive intent of acting out or self-destructive behavior and we express that by reframing, right. How is that cutting uh… trying to help, how is that cutting part trying to help? Umm… How is the suicidal part trying to help? Is it trying to control feelings that once upon a time would have been unsafe, is it trying feel strength and toughness in the body? Is that suicidal part trying to make sure that no trauma ever happens again? Umm… You know, my client Annie says, "Each part of me tries to fix things in its own way." I think a very lovely way of talking about this. Remember, cutting works because it triggers adrenaline and endorphin production, right. We get the hit of adrenaline that gives a feeling of calm, control, power, you know, like an EMT response, endorphins take the edge off the physical and emotional pain. Right. Suicidality is about control, right. I say fight keeps a parachute or a bailout plan so that it always has an out. And almost any behavior can be reframed. Also, we want to distinguish truly unsafe behavior with a lethal intent from behavior aimed at self-regulation because when we can reframe it as an attempt at self-regulation and the client feels more competent, that leads to greater effort to find other means of managing the same feelings. Once… I'm gonna just go ahead a little bit because I see our time is rapidly running out. Remember that for clients, safety is not a goal. Right, when you've never known safety, that's not a goal. But oftentimes, our clients are motivated to improve the quality of their lives. And so if we… if we rather than making safety our goal, maybe the goal could be: if you want your life to be different, if you want a normal life, we're gonna have to help those parts. Remember that we too are triggers when our clients have been harmed by human beings, even helping human beings, are unfortunately triggering. So what do we do with that? We make sure that we use the least triggering forms of communication. If I have a hard message to deliver, I… I smile more, I soften my face, I put a lilt in my voice because I want to make sure that whatever I have to state is distinguished from shaming, humiliating, negative language. Rather than confront, be curious. This is so interesting, something must have triggered you, huh! And make use of your social engagement muscles. Right, this is the therapist's secret weapon. This comes from Stephen Porges Polyvagal theory, "The social engagement system is a brain system connected to the movements of your eyes and eyelids, your facial muscles for smiling, softening, pardoning, to the turning and tilting movements of the head and neck, and to your larynx." And so use it, use your facial expression. To amplify your interest, your fascination. You know, I find that empathy is actually less regulating than… than… than curiosity, excitement, enthusiasm, interest combined with empathy. Umm… So let your voice, your body language, facial expression respond to all parts. And what often happens is that suicidal intensity lessens in the session in response to my social engagement system. Play with how you communicate, right. I… I'm very proud to say that, that in my 33 years of practice I've never involuntarily hospitalized a client. And how does that happen? Because I keep my social engagement system online and when the client says, "Well, I'm not safe and I'm not going to the hospital, I'm going home," I say, "You know, that's a problem 'cause I'm just not comfortable with that." And they say, "Well, what do you have to do with it?" I say, "Well, you know, we're… we're in this together and I'm not comfortable." And usually if I just keep saying, "You know, I'm just not comfortable with a plan in which you're not safe. So let's keep thinking, right, because we kind of come up with something, right. You're not comfortable with the hospital, but I'm not comfortable with your going home in this state that doesn't feel safe." So remember to avoid the mistakes inherent in working with unsafe behavior. Don't fail to invalidate the relief that unsafe behavior offers. Before you try to intervene, validate the relief. I know this helps. Remember that the fear of relying on others is much greater than the fear of hurting the body. Remember that the care of the body and safety are not priorities for those who've never known such things. It's… It's… It's like selling refrigerators to Eskimos. Umm… Convey that you know it feels normal to keep secrets and very, very exposing or dangerous to disclose. And then make sure, and this is where the… the parts model is so helpful, to avoid getting into that struggle in which we're the champions of safety and the client then has to champion danger. Instead, validate that the unsafe behavior helps so the client has a chance to say, Yeah, but it's got a few problems too."
