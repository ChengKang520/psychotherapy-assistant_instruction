NARRATOR This hour long training session was a part of one of Dr. Landreth's two day workshops on making contact with children through play therapy. In this video, Dr. Landreth describes the characteristics of facilitative responses, explains the process of helping children learn self-responsibility and suggest ways to keep the child in the lead in the therapeutic process. He also demonstrates how to respond to issues and questions children present in play therapy. Dr. Garry Landreth is a regents professor and founder and director of the Center for Play Therapy at the University of North Texas, the largest play therapy training program in the world. Dr. Landreth is internationally recognized as one of the foremost spokesman for and developer of the Child Centered Approach to play therapy. He has pioneered Child Centered Approach play therapy training in international setting such as China, Korea and South Africa. And is a frequent conference speaker and workshop presenter throughout the United States. Dr. Landreth's over 100 publications and videos include his book Play Therapy: The Art of the Relationship, which is widely considered to be the authoritative source on Child Centered Play Therapy and has been published in Chinese, Korean and Russian. His video Child Centered Play Therapy: A Clinical Session demonstrates his approach to play therapy. 

00:01:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH My concern is, is that we not reinforce dependency. Let me share with you, uh, five-year-old Darrel. I was watching the first session with Darrel, um, my doctoral student came in with five-year-old Darrel and, uh, here is the way Darrel started. I will try to sound the way he is, he walks in the playroom, she introduced him to the playroom. He walked over to the sandbox and he said, "Is that a sandbox?" Folks, it's this big, it's this deep and it's that got much sand in it and Darrel is saying is that a sandbox? To which she said, "Must look like a sandbox to you Darrel", which is a great response. Whatever a child asks about in that, along that line of questioning. Is that a spaceship? They're saying that looks like a spaceship to me. If they point to this and say, um, is that a car? Then they're saying that looks like car then. So the logical response is must look like a car to you. Darrel started to step into the sandbox and realizes he had shoes on, stepped back down, looked at her and said, "Would you please take my shoes off, so I can play in your sandbox." "Darrel in here if you want your shoes off you can take your shoes off." He sat down and took his shoes off. He's five years old, he knows how to do it. It was not a question he did not know how to take his shoes off. He climbed into the sandbox, looked at her and said, "Is it okay if I dig holes in your sand?" "Hmm, sounds like you got something in mind you want to do Darrel. In here that's something you can decide." He picked up a scoop and dug holes in the sand. On the wall close to the sandbox are shelves. There's a little blue car right there. She's seated across the room. He looked at the blue car, looked at her and said, "Would you please hand me that blue car?" And she said, "Darrel in here if you want the blue car you can get the blue car". He reached out and got it, it was right there. He plays with the blue car. He finished. He said, "I think I'm through playing in your sandbox. Is it okay if I get out of your sandbox now?" "Sounds like you got something else in mind you want to do Darrel. In here you can decide what you're going to do next". He got out of the sandbox , walked over to the table. They're crayons and scissors and paper there and he said, "Can I color with your crayons?" "Sounds like you got something in mind you want to do Darrel. You can decide if you want to color with the crayons or not." He picked up a crayon, started to color, put the crayon back down and said, "I'm going to color apple tree. What color are apple trees?" "Darrel in here apple trees can be any color you want apple trees to be." Folks that went on for 45 minutes. I'm back the next week, I want to see what has happened to dependent Darrel. It was another 45 minutes. This whining little five-year-old who just could not do anything for himself. I'm back the next week I want to see if dependent Darrel is going to change any of this dependent behavior. Well, in the third week there were a few minutes that he did not ask for something. In the fourth week, I'm back again. In the fourth week well, there are quite a few times here he did somethings without asking. In the fifth week, he came in, he just walked in and he just immediately went around, collected every piece of fruit, vegetable plastic food stuff he could find, heaped it up and created this whole big banquet out in the middle of the table. Got all the cooking utensils around there. Created this big food scene. He is standing there with his hands on his hip surveying what he had created and the play therapist said "There Darrel, you did it all by yourself." And he jerked around and looked at her and said, "Hell, yes, lady I don't need no help." 

00:05:50

00:05:55
DR. GARRY LANDRETH In five weeks he had gone from I can't do anything for myself to I can take care of the world, thank you. All because she created the kind of relationship that allowed him to discover his own strengthens, not because she did it for him. When you do for children what they can do for themselves you teach them they are weak. In this relationship we allow children to struggle. Sometimes I'm must first struggle before I discover a strength. And I may never discover that strength if I never have to struggle. Folks there is only one way you can learn that you can go through deep pain. There's only one way you can discover that you can survive extreme stress and that's by doing what? Go through it. It's the only way you discover that you can, that you're capable is by going through it. It's like the child on the slide; there's only one way you can discover what that experience is like and that's to go down the slide; to live through the grief; to struggle through the pain; to find out you can overcome difficult circumstances. That's called living and that's a part of this relationship that we call play therapy. As we get to the door of the play room and I open the door of the play room, I say to the child, "Robert, this is our play room and this is a place where you can play with the toys in a lot of the ways you'd like to." I'm going to stand back up , I would not do this in the play room and you all now begin to say or do whatever you think a child might say or do in the, but you don't raise your hand just pop it out and I'll respond to as many of you as I can. 

00:08:00
Whose toys are these? 

00:08:00
UNKNOWN Whose toys are these? 

00:08:05
DR. GARRY LANDRETH These are toys for you to play with while you're here. 

00:08:05
Can I have this to take home? 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN Can I have this, I want to take it home? 

00:08:10
DR. GARRY LANDRETH I know you'd like to take that home with you. It would be fun to have that car but all the toys are for staying in the play room so they will be here when you come back next week. 

00:08:15
What's that? 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN What's that?

I've got to potty! 

00:09:00
UNKNOWN I got to go potty. 

00:09:00

00:10:50
UNKNOWN Go stand in the corner. Go stand in the corner. 

00:10:50
DR. GARRY LANDRETH You'd like me to go stand in the corner. I choose to sit here. You can pretend I'm standing in the corner or you can pretend Bobo is me and put Bobo in the corner. 

00:11:00
Why don't you answer my questions? 

00:11:00
UNKNOWN Why don't you answer my questions? 

00:11:05
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Oh, you'd just like for me to tell you maybe what to do like other adults do? Hmm. But in, in here is different.

But I don't like that. 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN Stop talking like that.

UNKNOWN Why did my mom bring me here? 

00:11:30

00:11:45
UNKNOWN Are you going to tell my mom what I do? 

00:11:45
DR. GARRY LANDRETH What happens in here is just for me and for you. You can tell your mom the things that you do in the play room if you want but I, I'm not going to tell your mom what you do in the play room. 

00:11:55
I need this to stay right here till next time? 

00:11:55
UNKNOWN I need this to stay right here till next time? 

00:12:00
DR. GARRY LANDRETH I know you'd like for that to stay just like you made it right there but I need to let you know there are other children who come to the play room and that probably won't be like that when you come back. 

00:12:15
Who are the other children? 

00:12:15
UNKNOWN Who are the other children? 

00:12:15

DR. GARRY LANDRETH Just different reasons. 

00:12:25
I hate you. 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN I hate you. 

00:12:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH You just decided you don't like me. Not only do you not like me you hate me right now. 

00:12:35
Can I hang my picture here? 

00:12:40
UNKNOWN Can I hang my picture here? 

00:12:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH You can choose where you'd like to hang your picture but I need to let you know ahead of time that when you leave I'll take your picture down and I'll put it in a special folder for you. 

00:12:50
Do you have a family and kids too? 

00:12:55
UNKNOWN Do you have a family and kids too? 

00:13:00
DR. GARRY LANDRETH I, I have family and kids. Sounds like you know about families and kids. 

00:13:05
I don't see why I have to come here. I ain't crazy. 

00:13:05
UNKNOWN I don't see why I have to come here anyway. I ain't crazy. 

00:13:05
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Oh, so sounds like maybe you have heard that somewhere that if you go to the play room you're supposed to be weird or crazy or different or something, but this is a place for all kinds of boys and girls who come here. 

00:13:20
So I just get to play here and that's it. 

00:13:20
UNKNOWN So I just get to play here and that's it. 

00:13:25
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Sounds like you have figured it out . 

00:13:30
[sil.] 

00:13:30
Would you play with me? 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN Would you play with me? 

00:13:35
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Sounds like you have something in mind. 

00:13:35
Would you play UNO with me? 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN Would you play UNO with me? 

00:13:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Aside, that would never be in my play room. We'll talk about that later. 

00:13:50
[sil.] 

00:13:50
Why are you in here? 

00:13:55
UNKNOWN Why are you in here? 

00:13:55
DR. GARRY LANDRETH I'm in here to be with you because I want to be with you. 

00:14:00
Why? 

00:14:00
UNKNOWN Why? 

00:14:00
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Because I like being with you. 

00:14:00
Would you turn the lights out please? 

00:14:05
UNKNOWN Would you turn the lights out please? 

00:14:05
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Well, the lights are for staying on but there's a flash light over there you can turn on and off. 

00:14:10
I don't like you in here. 

00:14:10
UNKNOWN I don't like you in here . 

00:14:15
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Oh, you'd rather I would go somewhere else right now. 

00:14:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:14:20
DR. GARRY LANDRETH I know you want me to leave but I'm going to be here until our time is up and we have 20 more minutes in the play room and then it will be time for both of us to leave the play room. 

00:14:30
Do you like the other kids more than you like me? 

00:14:35
UNKNOWN Do you like the other kids more than you like me? 

00:14:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH I like you and I like the other boys and girls, too. That's not something I try to decide who I like best or who I don't like best. Maybe that's what you've experienced with some other big people in your life but that's not true here. 

00:14:55
Why do you like me? 

00:15:00
UNKNOWN Why do you like me? 

00:15:00
DR. GARRY LANDRETH I just like you because you're you. 

00:15:00
Can I sit on your lap? 

00:15:00
UNKNOWN Can I sit on your lap? 

00:15:05
DR. GARRY LANDRETH If you'd like. 

00:15:05
If I break something will you hit me? 

00:15:05
UNKNOWN If I break something will you hit me? 

00:15:10
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Sometimes accidents happen in here and no I would never hit you. 

00:15:10
Can I cut this doll's hair? 

00:15:15
UNKNOWN Can I cut this doll's hair? 

00:15:15
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Well, that doll's hair's not for cutting but, uh, the paper there on the table that's for cutting. 

00:15:20
Can I handcuff you to the chair? 

00:15:20
UNKNOWN Can I handcuff you to the chair? 

00:15:25
DR. GARRY LANDRETH You can handcuff me like this. Okay, let's stop here. You all make good children. Those are very typical kinds of questions that children ask or wonder about in the first part of a play therapy experience. Now let me ask you what would you infer my objectives were from what you heard from me? What were my objectives? 

00:16:00
UNKNOWN Redirect. 

00:16:00
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Redirect meaning what's my objective there? 

00:16:05
UNKNOWN To the child therapy. 

00:16:10
DR. GARRY LANDRETH My, my objective is to put the responsibility on to the child. 

00:16:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:16:15
DR. GARRY LANDRETH What I was doing here in many cases where it was appropriate when I said things like that's something you can decide, that is called returning responsibility to the child. That is a crucial element in play therapy , returning responsibility to the child. How can the child ever learn what responsibility feels like if they never are allowed to struggle with the issue of being responsible for making a decision. You see this begins when we first enter the play room, responsibility to decide what to play with first because I don't say to the child what to play with first or even what to play. By the way what is the first thing you saw me do when we walked into the play, when I walked into the play room? What's the first thing you saw? I sat down that's the first lesson in play therapy sit down. If you follow the child around what is the message to the child? 

00:17:25
UNKNOWN Something you can do, something you can't. I don't trust you. 

00:17:25
DR. GARRY LANDRETH I don't trust you and I'm in charge. As long as you stand up in the child's presence the message to the child is I'm in charge and children have learned that well in classrooms. Teachers stand up when they have something they want to be incharge of. And, uh, adults do the same thing. When an adult wants to emphasis a message to a child in their home they don't remain seated. They stand up and children learn this. So if you want to relinquish responsibility immediately you sit down and immediately the child goes, agm this, this feels different in here. Just by sitting down you have relinquished responsibility to the child. What were some other objectives you'd infer from my interactions? 

00:18:20
UNKNOWN Accepting. 

00:18:20
DR. GARRY LANDRETH I want to be accepting of this child and I'm not going to evaluate this child. This is a non-evaluative relationship. There is no place for evaluation anywhere in the play therapy relationship. There can't be acceptance and evaluation in the same relationship. One will interfere with the other particularly the evaluation will interfere with the acceptance. 

00:18:50
UNKNOWN When I said redirect I meant that you said no without saying no, you can turn on the flash light. You gave him power over something but not when they requested. 

00:19:00
Characteristics of Therapeutic Responses Are brief and interactive Allow the child to lead Are personalized Avoid: "David really likes hitting that Bobo" Use: "You really like hitting that Bobo" Touch feelings 

00:19:00
Characteristics of Therapeutic Responses Avoid asking questions Help child to go on Do not interrupt natural flow of child's play Are non-evaluative Do not praise Build self-esteem 

00:19:05
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Actually, uh, the point here was that I said no without saying no. I never think of saying no to a child in the play room; that never occurs to me. I'm always thinking how can I respond to this child so that the child is allowed to accomplish what they would like to accomplish or what they need to accomplish? So it, it becomes, that becomes the area of focus rather than stopping the behavior. How can I facilitate the child going on and expressing that need? Um, so it never, it never occurs to me to say don't do that or stop that or quit that, uh, or no. Those behaviors just aren't there. It's always facilitating the child to go on but in an appropriate acceptable way. Let's take a look at the characteristics of facilitative responses. What is that makes a response helpful? What are the characteristics? And it seems to me these are some of the characteristics of helpful responses that in interacting with children our responses should be brief. Children tend to get overwhelmed by long responses and they begin to focus on trying to understand this long response that's coming in and then they forget what was important to them or they forget their own direction. So our responses should be as brief as possible. When Haim Ginott was alive he used to say if you can't say it in 10 words or less don't say it, the child probably won't remember it. That's pretty good advice, that most of our responses should be 10 words or less. Many adults are too verbal, and need to learn to shorten their responses. Um, the response should be short enough that it can be interactive. By that I mean it doesn't interfere with the flow. Um, a child this morning , the child on the video tape said, uh, they're gonna fly to New York and my response was, a long way away. Because that is and it says I got your message without just reflecting pure word content. Helpful responses allow the child to lead. If we start giving answers we get in the lead , if we ask questions we get in the lead. If we try to solve the problem, we get in the lead. In the role playing a few minutes go there were a number of times that I could have just given an answer and then that cuts off the interaction and I become the answer source. If a child says, holds this up, what is that? And I tell the child, uh, that's a drinking cup, uh, that puts me in the lead as being the decision maker. It also deprives the child of the opportunity to use that item in the way that they would like to use it. It doesn't have to be what it seems to be intended for. Uh, so we want to always keep the child in the lead in this relationship. Helpful responses are personalized. We would avoid making comments as David is beating on the Bobo, saying David is really beating on the Bobo or David really likes hitting that Bobo as though David was not even here. We're talking about the child. Uh, helpful responses are personalized. We would take that same situation and it would come out you really like hitting that Bobo rather than David likes hitting the Bobo. That objective, uh, David likes something, uh, really is a, is a response that begins to cause children to separate from who they are as though I'm not even present, talking about the child. Helpful responses touch feelings when feelings are evident but there may be many periods of time in a play therapy session where you're not aware of a feeling. So you can't label a feeling, you're not sure what feeling is there the child is playing in a very non-committal sort of way and you're not aware of any anger or happiness or sadness or any other kind of emotion. In such cases you'd probably find yourself making lots of tracking, what we call tracking responses. Uh, tracking responses are those responses in which you're wanting to let the child know I'm here, I'm with you, I understand what you're doing. Tracking responses are observational kinds of responses in which you put into words that what you observe. You, uh, just ran that right into the wall. And notice I didn't say you ran that car right into the wall. You just ran that right into the wall. We do not label items until the child has labeled them. We don't assume that is a car in this child's life or that's the father just because it looks like the father doll. So in play therapy we use the word 'that' a lot. You just picked that up, you just put that in there because I don't know what the child wants this to be and so we're very cautious about labeling something unless we get in the lead and interfere with where the child was headed. Uh, for example, um, I, uh, I did a workshop in Portland recently and after the workshop we dealt with this issue that I'm talking with you all about now and, uh, later I, I got a letter from this play therapist who was describing a situation with the child. In her play room she has a Fisher Price schoolhouse. One of those that closes up, who has got handle on it, it looks like a school house; that's in her play room. And this little boy took two of those little stubby wooden Fisher Price figures, they go walking up to the door and just as they went through the door the play therapist said they are going inside the school house and she said the child turned around and looked at me and said lady it ain't a school house, it's a hospital. You see we can ahead of children in labeling so we do not label until the child has labeled. Now with the exception of emotions we do readily label children's emotions because they don't know what those labels are for those emotions. But items in the play room can be whatever the child wants the item to be. We avoid asking questions. Uh, if the child wants us to know the child will tell us. Uh, and we, uh, we don't, uh, answer questions that haven't been asked either. We don't ask the child question, and we don't answer questions that have not been asked. It may appear to be a question, like a child says what is that. Uh, maybe this is an insecure child who does have an idea about what that is. Uh, it just may appear to be a question. So we're very careful not to answer questions, um, and very careful to answer questions that have not been asked either. We would help a child, uh, to go on by the kind of response that we make. Helpful responses do not interrupt the natural flow. I like my responses best when they're like the Olympic high diver who goes off the high board and as the diver's body intersects the plane of the water there is just this little bit of a splash and the body's gone, it has intersected the plane of water. No big huge splash you'd almost instantly you'd hardly know the diver had ever been there and I like my responses when they are like that that right after I've responded there is no big huge splash, you'd hardly know I had responded. The child just goes on. If I respond and the child stops doing what they're doing and that happens very often I should examine my responses. I'm interfering with the child's flow, with the process of what the child is doing. Either I'm off track or my responses are too long or both, uh, but our responses should be inserted into the child's play and not interfere with the child's, uh, process. Helpful responses are non-evaluative. There is no place in evaluation, in play therapy for evaluation. This is a non-evaluative relationship. Children are evaluated enough in other places in their lives; they shouldn't come into the play room and be evaluated. It can be the way they want to be in here. We do not evaluate the children's artwork or their production is being good or bad. It, uh, should never occur to the play therapist to use the word good because of the connation. You did a good job with that. That's evaluation. Uh, if I can evaluate it as been good, I also have the power to evaluate it's being bad, you see. I always create that possibility when I take any kind of evaluative stance or making evaluative response to a child. Helpful responses do not praise. There's no place for praise in the play room. Praise tends to be reinforcing for what the person doing the praise wants. Um, now, I'm, I'm talking about the play room, I'm not talking parent child interactions. I think at home in your interactions with your child, it's okay to sometimes say that's great job, wow I'm proud of you. Those are natural kinds of parent child interaction. But in the play room there is no place for that. Um, praise tends to restrict children's behavior. We have known since, uh, July 1988, uh, that praise is not helpful. In, in July 1988, in the NAEYC Publication Young Children in that Journal, Young Children Published by the National Association for the Education of Young Children, uh, the authors of this article that I'm referring to pull together all the research that had ever been done or could be found on praise and the results of praise and what they found was that praise produces children who have poor self-esteem; they lack initiative and they're less creative. Praise tends to be structuring and reinforcing. Uh, we should be, uh, recognizing the children's effort, yes, but not praising. If you're going to praise something praise the effort and it should show up in your tone of voice, you worked hard on that rather than that's a beautiful picture. Uh, yes?w

Facilitative Responses Was the response freeing to the child? Did the response facilitate decision making or responsibility? Was spontaneity or creative facilitated? Did the child feel understood? 

00:32:15
DR. GARRY LANDRETH They lack initiative and they are less creative. And if you'd like to read this whole summary of research, it's a very extensive summary, uh, many pages of research. Uh, so the, uh, issue is July 1988 Young Children Journal. Helpful responses build self-esteem. We've already talked about that I think enough. There are four questions you can ask they will help you to determine whether or not you're response are helpful to children. The first question is: Was the response freeing to the child? Or this response I'm about to make, will this free the child or restrict the child in some way. Will it bind the child to my world of reality? Or will it free to the child to express himself or herself in the way they would like to express themselves. Second question did the response facilitate decision making or in some way grant responsibility and for me that is a crucial dimension in my relationships with children; that I want to respond in ways that allow children to make decisions. Folks how do you discover what decision making feels like if nobody ever allows you to make decisions. As adults most of us are poor decision makers because we didn't grow up been allowed to struggle with making decisions and if you just want to see the struggle we have look at a group of people trying to decide where to go eat lunch. Nobody will take the responsibility and say let's go here. Oh, the other people might not like me if or that place or something. Uh, we struggle with taking on the responsibility that goes with decision making and you can't learn what responsibility feels like if nobody ever allows you to make decisions. Third, was spontaneity or creative facilitated. This response I'm about to make, will it help this child to become more spontaneous or more creative or will it in some way restrict the child? Will the child be inhabited by my response or make a response that only pleases me or what the child thinks I might like? And then the fourth question to ask is did the child feel understood? 

00:35:05
[sil.] 

00:35:10
DR. GARRY LANDRETH And I think that's always in the back of my mind that I'm wanting to let this child know I understand, I understand what you're doing; I understand what you're feeling; I understand what you're thinking; I understand you. That is a very freeing therapeutic dimension to feel understood, feeling understood frees you to go on to the next dimension of exploration. Let me show you how this four questions play out. May I borrow your bottle here? 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:35:50
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Um, let's pretend that this is a can with a big red tomato on it right there, can you see that big red tomato in your mind's eye? I'm five years old, I pick, we've been together in the play room maybe 15 minutes I pick up this can it's got a big red tomato on it. I stick it out towards you and I say what is this? Respond to me in a way that will answer two or three of these dimensions positively. What is this? Okay, I heard a lot of different responses. Let me sort through them. You're wondering what that is, that's kind of a delay. What is this? You're wondering what that is, yes I would like to know what that is. You see we're right back where . . . yes what is it? We're right back where we started. Um, and if some of you were thinking, well what do you want to be? Take the question and turn it into a statement. You see when you say to the child what would you like for it to be, the child . . . you're really trying to say to the child what? It can be whatever you want it to be but if it comes out this way: what do you want it to be? The child will say, what? I don't know. Uh, this child named Cindy stuck this can out toward me and said, "What is this?" And I said, "Cindy in here and that's a qualifier I often use with children in the first session, which says in here's different and I recognize that. It may not be this way out in the classroom but in here. Cindy in here that can be whatever you want it to be and she is so spontaneously said, "Oh, goody, it's a turkey and I'm going to bake it for our supper." And she walked over, pulled the oven door down and plopped this old rusty can in the oven. Now I ask you did Cindy want to know what is this? How do we know that she didn't want to know that? Because of the spontaneity of her response. You see my response allowed her to be spontaneous and creative by saying in here that can be whatever you wanted to be and just like that she said, oh, goody it's a turkey and I'm going to bake it for our supper. Now I don't think she thought about that just at that moment. I think that was already in her mind when she said what is this. I don't think that she didn't have the foggiest notion about what she was going to do and she held this up and said what is this and I said that can be whatever you want to be. And she goes, duh, let me see what I wanted, all I want to be a turkey. No that didn't happen, it was already in her mind. And all I did was release it by saying in here it can be whatever you wanted it to be. And she said, oh, goody, it's a turkey and I'm going to bake it for our supper. And then she proceeded to set the table. And every time she sets the table she has to get close to me. You feel differently right here and I bet I feel differently to you. Uh, there, these are not accidents that happen, folks. This is an unconscious motivational part of the child to be closer. It's not by accident that the child just zooms the airplane around close to you. [00:39:15They could fly it over there and never come over here close to me but they're motivated to come feel what we feel like and they come close to us. It's not accident that the ball rolls into our, uh, part of the room and they have to come fish it out from under our chair. That gives them a chance to approach us and be close to us. You see just because the ball rolls under my chair don't assume that the child wants it back. So I don't just automatically reach down to pick up the ball and pitch it back, I by doing that might deprive the child of ever getting close to me. If the child says, throw it back, I will readily throw it back but I'll wait until the child is made that decision. If, uh, let's examine this. When Cindy picked up the, uh, can and said what is this, you, you be the child and you've just said that to me. And let me, let me hear your verbal response to my response. You're the child, you have said to me what is this, it's got a big red tomato you said what is this and I say to you, Cindy that's a can with a red tomato on it. Your verbal response would be, oh. And that's the end of that, do you see what can happen by answering questions children have not asked. She didn't want to know what is this, what she wondered was can this be what I'd like to pretend and so we restrict the child's creativity by just simply answering what appears to be a very simple question, what is this can put us in the lead and interfere with the child's process of building a relationship just like she has experienced. Who do you invite into your home and, uh, cook dinner for? People you want to get to know better, or people you love. That's why you begin to build the relationship that's what she did, she cooked a meal for me. So it was significant when she said, "Oh, goody, it's a turkey and I'm going to cook it for our supper." See she had already included me in the first few minutes of this relationship. I'll share with you how I responded in these situations and you can compare my responses to your responses. Mary picks out two large throwing darts, they have got the big rubber suction cups on them and she sticks those up and she asks what do you do with these? And your response? 

00:42:00
GROUP You can choose. 

00:42:05
DR. GARRY LANDRETH You can choose or in here you can decide. At that moment folks we're not the least concerned, bit concerned about the possibility of having to set a limit. We worry about setting the limit when the need arises to set the limit but we're not looking ahead to that. At this moment we're trying to free this child, to allow this child to spontaneous. She, she's wondering what these are. Folks if we get into the business of identifying what's that. Those are darts. What's that? That's a light. Uh, what's that? That's a pen. Uh, then we become the child's answer source. And we restrict the child's creativity. Uh, I don't want the child depending on me for answers because I'm not always going to be there. You won't always be there. Folks we only spend 45 minutes with the child out of their entire week. There are thousands of other opportunities for them to make decisions and if I don't help them to get ready for that they won't be able to meet those needs. But in here in 45 minutes I can help them to get ready for that. What do you do with those? In here you can decide. Mary, uh, stands the father doll figure in the sand and begins to pour sand over the dolls head until the sand is heaped up around the doll and just begins to cover the doll's eyes. Can you see that in your mind's eye? Here this doll figure, she sticks the doll in the sand. She pours sand over the top. Here it comes up around the doll figures body. It just covers the eyes and she says I poured sand all the way up to his eyebrows. Now, go back and look at your response and see if you might want to change or how you might change your response. If you look through the doll's eyes and respond. Now I'm going to take you back through it and you respond and this will help you to look at maybe the possibility of becoming interactive rather than just reflective of the content. Now the child pours the doll up over the sa-, over the body. Here it comes up around, the body is building up and it just covers the doll's eyes and the child says, "I poured sand all the way up to his eyebrows." And your response could be, and now he can't see. Just an interactive response here because you're looking through the doll's eyes. Now if the child should suddenly say, yes he can then, you still can make this work out okay. Oh, so that doll can even see through sand or dirt. Must have special eyes. "Yeah, he's got x-ray vision." See it can still workout okay, uh, so you don't always have to make a word reflection. Mary sets up up a barnyard scene. She has placed three horses inside the fence, one at a time. Here are two cows still out here. She gets one cow, here she comes over the fence, inside the fence and your response and I know what some of you were thinking there. I'm not going to say anything. Let's assume you haven't said a word for 10 minutes. Now you need to say something, so what would you say. Here comes the cow over and your response? You have something in mind or? Looks like you have a plan or? Let's be a little bit more specific. 

00:45:45
UNKNOWN You want one of these to be with one of those. 

00:45:45
DR. GARRY LANDRETH You want that one to be with those or? You're going to put that one in there with the others. Now we don't know this is a cow, you see, because it doesn't say she labeled it as a cow. We don't know she sees those as horses. She hasn't labeled them as horses. Uh, in this case I'm absolutely convinced that, um, that cow that was left was symbolic of this child because she never picked that last one up. This was an unchosen child. Never chosen in the classroom, never chosen on the playground. So it would not be appropriate either you see as she comes over with the cow to say you're going to put them all over the fence. That's leading. I don't know that. She left the one over there by, all by itself. Uh, so the, the response could be, you're going to put that one over there as she is doing that one. Mary draws a picture which she identifies as a girl, holds the picture up for you to see and with a big smile on her face she says, "Do you think my picture is pretty?" And in the play room we do not evaluate nor do we praise. So? 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) 

00:47:20
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Okay or identify with the smile on her face. What does that indicate? It indicates she's pleased. You see that, you read that you hear that with your eyes, you hear that with your eyes. Big smile on her face as she says, "Do you think my picture is pretty?" And so the response back then could be, you're really proud of your picture. Or you really like your picture. That's what showing in her face and in that way we avoid labeling or praising or evaluating. "Do you think my picture is pretty?" Folks I would never say to a child in the play room I think your picture is pretty. I've never said that to a child. Um, I had one little boy that, uh, drew a picture fairly quickly and I felt like he was, by the question, testing me. He said, uh, "Do you think my picture is pretty." He had drawn it real quickly and didn't put much effort into it. And I said, uh, "Well I see you put some blue . . . that's another thing you can do you just identify what you see. I said, "You put some blue right here and some green over here. Oh, and a whole bunch of brown up, up there." Uh, and he said, "But do you think it's pretty?" And I said, "In here you can decide whether or not your picture is pretty." And he said, "Look man, I just want to know do you think my picture is pretty." And I said, "I know you want me to decide about your picture but in here the important thing is not whether or not I think your picture is pretty but whether or not you think your picture is pretty." And that seemed to resolve the issue for this child. There is a technique that you can use to keep children in the lead and what I'm about to share with you is a technique and any technique can be overworked. You, you saw the video tape of Paul, the child who, who buried in the sandbox. Um, must have been about the, I don't know, the sixth or seventh session that we had together. He set up a scene of chasing, um, a bank robber or the fellow, this guy had stolen something and Paul has an imaginary policeman friend and they go chasing around the play room and in the bathroom and out. And Paul would come in front of the two way mirror and stop and do things like this: he'd stop and say, "Boy, partner I need a shave, I haven't shaved in three days. And his partner would say, "Well, he is not stopping to shave we've got to stay after him." And he said, "Yeah, you're right." They'd chase some more and he'd come back in front of the two-way mirror. And he said, "Boy partner, look at that my eyes are all bloodshot. We haven't slept in five nights." And the partner said, "Yeah, but he is not sleeping either. We gotta . . . and they'd stay after him and they run around the room at one point Paul said, "Boy partner, I'm hungry. Let's stop and get a Whataburger. And the imaginary partner said, "Well, he is not stopping to eat." And he'd say, "Yeah, you're right we got to stay after . . ." They chased this guy for seven days, finally caught him and he grabbed the Bobo, drug the Bobo over and popped him down right in front of me and he said "You are the judge. Is he guilty?" And my first thought was hang him. And after all this child had put such effort into that, he chased this guy for seven days and . . . but I said, "What should I say?" And Paul said, "You say he's not guilty." So I said, "Uh, he's not guilty." Paul said, "What do you mean he is not guilty?" And he threw his gun across the room, just glared at me. And I said, "What should I say?" Paul said, "You say he is not guilty because you don't have enough evidence." So I said, "He's not guilty because you don't have enough evidence." And Paul turned to his imaginary partner and said, "See partner, I've been telling you all week we're gonna have to get more evidence on this guy or we're going to drag him in here in front of the judge and the judge is going to turn him lose cuz we don't have enough evidence. See what's happening, he is turning him lose." And he threw his handcuffs across the room and he just sort of sauntered off into the sunset. And I thought I would have never resolved this way, would you? See we have to keep the child in the lead and there are ways, that's, that's a technique that can be overworked quickly. You shouldn't use that whisper technique more than maybe two or three times in a whole series of sessions with the same child. Not more than once in one session and then two or three se- . . . but if you use this two three times in one session, it won't work, it won't work. But now and then like that it will work as a way to keep the child in the lead.
