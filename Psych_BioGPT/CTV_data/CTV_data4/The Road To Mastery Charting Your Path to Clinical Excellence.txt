RICH SIMON So in 2007, our luncheon speaker this morning, was part of a (ph)troika of authors who produced an article that had as much of an impact on me as anything we've ever published in the Networker. It did for psychotherapy what moneyball did for baseball. It cut through all the orthodoxies, antiquated theories and sheer blather that often dominates or field and illuminated the question of therapeutic effectiveness in a way I had never seen anybody do that before. Reviewing a large sample of therapy outcome data, Scott and his co-authors took a look at the question of what separates the very best therapists from the rest of us. He looked at the top 25% of therapists, those whose success rates were consistently at least 50% higher than average to try to find out what it was about them that was different from your average Joe or Joanna Blow. We already know from the research of people like Bruce Wampold and others that whatever puts these therapists at the top of their game, whatever the true believers in empirically supported therapy may say, it's not any particular intervention or model, no matter how many randomized clinical trials that approach has aced. So what is it that makes these Supershrinks better than everybody else? Scott is going to tell us about that in a, in a moment. His work poses the fundamental question for many of us in the field in search of ways being more effective in what we do. Just how do you get to be that good? How do you keep those potential drop-outs from dropping out? How do you improve your capacity for connecting with clients and keeping the connection powerful, regardless of the vicissitudes of therapy. I think that many of us, in the secret recesses of our hearts, many of us dream that if we just spend enough years actually doing therapy, working hard, seeing more clients, getting more experience, going to more workshops, watching more videos, becoming more grown up ourselves, we too will somehow acquire that magical x-factor by some kind of osmosis that will take us to that next level, and, of course, in our heart of hearts, some of us still hope that there is some wonderful new technique just around the corner that will allow us to express our hitherto hidden inner genius for consistently magical results in our consis-, our consulting rooms. So what does make therapists better? Scott is about to talk to you about it, but let me give you a quick gloss. Uh, Malcolm Gladwell and others have popularized the idea that 10,000 hours of practice is necessary to truly master a complex skill, but it turns out it's not simply putting in those 10,000 hours of hard work that makes a difference. If you're a tennis player with a terrific forehand and a lame backhand, 10,000 hours of work on your forehand isn't gonna make your backhand the least bit better, so to it improve at something, it's not just a matter of working hard. You also have to work smart. So he will talk about the, the particulars of that, so . . . But there's a new dimension and, and, and I wanna get to the new dimension . . . So Scott published this article on Supershrinks and uh, I was very impressed with it and it felt like a whole new way of how wanna, we improve our skills, how do we become more accountable, and um, what happened was, and Scott just wrote about this recently in the article, the world did not beat a path to his door. People did not transform their practices; there was something in this equation that wasn't quite missing, that was missing that was really an essential element in this whole process, so there was a, there was a whole steps out of steps. Scott and his co-authors couldn't, uh, couldn't have been clearer. And then, the question was: well, why didn't all of us just do those things? There was research, it made common sense . . . There was all kinds of ways. It was corroborated by research being done in, in a wide research traditions, particularly the work of, uh, Anders Ericsson, so why doesn't every therapist do them? Um, and so the, the question was . . . Well, basically, um, the fact of the matter is that we, that many people try to do some of these things, but after a brief period of time they lost steam. It's like, you know, it's like a lot of self-help things. You know that you, uh, you'd get better if you do them, but you don't do them. You don't go to the gym and shoot your 10,000 hours of free throws, even though you know it'll make you a better free throw shooter. So here's the challenge that Scott posed to, to us. It's, basically, therapists engage in what may be the world's loneliest profession. We're isolated from you, often increasingly, insulated from supervision or peer review, often lacking this ongoing give and take of colleagues when we need advice or just want to hash over the problems we're having with difficult clients. Like the experts of just about every other art, skill or profession - medicine, music, athletics, plumbing - therapists need a supportive, encouraging, challenging community to keep them on their toes and in their quest for the holy grail of excellence. It's really hard to renovate your practice without coaches, teammates, and people in the bleachers cheering us on. That's . . . We're social animals; we're wired, uh, that way, so what Scott has done, both on . . . He's, he's he's expanded his work and, currently, he's working on two fronts, so he's, uh, created a working method that individual therapists can use that he'll be describing here today on how they can (ph)profood their performance, and more recently he's focused on how do you provide this community in our time where we're, we have so many time pressures on us, we live, we work in, uh, either even our private practices or agency settings. We're so isolated and what Scott has done, along with a bunch of other colleagues from around the world, he's founded something called the International Center For Clinical Excellence, and this is an organization dedicated to promoting excellence in behavioral health care. It has a membership now of 3,000 therapists. It's a visionary organization; it's the kind of outfit you can join for free that allows you to consult with peers all over the world about your hard cases, share your mistakes - a humbling but necessary part of getting better at anything - hearing what other people experience, get, getting the courage to stick your neck out and try new ways of learning things and creating an atmosphere in which you can really learn how to, how to take your, take your skills and move to the next level in practice. So here's Scott, our very own (ph)Bobby Bean, will explain to how to go from doing just okay or even ordinarily good to really, really good, explain how the right kind of community of practice can be essential in the process. Okay team, listen up, here's our answer, (ph)not (ph)are (ph)we Bobby Bean, but Brad Pitt, the one and only Scott Miller.

SCOTT MILLER, PH.D. Wow, wow. That was remarkable. Thanks Rich, for that introduction. I'm so pleased to be with you all, be able to chat about the work that our colleagues and I are doing on this subject of excellence. It really is an audacious title, if you think about it. "How can we be excellent at the work we do?" And so before I talk about the steps to excellence I want to give a nod to how effective we already are. If we take a look at the data here - whoa, that was loud - if we take a look . . . Can we have the slides up here and we look at (crosstalk)just, just the facts, um, and uh, our work, what we do in, in our work and in the studies we do, most studies of psychological treatments conducted over the last 30 years, the average treated person is better off than 80% of the untreated sample in most studies. Just take a moment and let that sink in. Um, this is the way researchers speak to each other. They did not say we had an 80% success rate, right? They're always comparing the treated group to the untreated group, so in a room full of people, the one person who gets your care is gonna be better off than 80% of those who did not. Are you with me here? This is a phenomenal effect size. It is equal to coronary artery bypass surgery. Is that amazing? It is four times the effect of flouride in water; it's 27 times the effect of aspirin as a preventative for heart disease and stroke. We should put you guys in the water is what we should do, right? You just turn on the faucet, a little therapist pops his head out, says, "Hey. How the hell you doing?" All right? What you do really does work. It works really quite well, and, in fact, if you look at data from randomized clinical trials, the average clinicians - if we can go back to the slides here - average clinician achieves outcomes on par with success rates in tightly controlled, randomized clinical trials. This is very good news because most of the people you work with don't look like the people that are in randomized clinical trials. This is something I'm going to promise you, because, um, in those studies, even though they've made some progress, typically, the clients in those studies are limited to a single diagnosis or problem, and so here you're working with so-called messy clients, clients where co-morbidity is the rule, and again the data is really quite positive. What you do on a day-to-day basis works; it works quite well, and what is the (ph)piesta, as it stands for me, is that you accomplish these effects with a far more tolerable side-effect profile. If there were an ad for what you do on TV everyday, it wouldn't have to be followed by a one-minute caveat that said, "May cause diaphoresis, sweating, dry mouth, your hair to fall out or an erection lasting four hours", right? Cuz let's face it, if your work causes an erection lasting four hours, that was probably the point, uh, of, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, of the work that you're doing. What you do really does work. It works really quite well. There's no question about it, and if we don't start here, then when I start to talk about excellence, it can be quite discouraging, so let's just assume that we've all entered the Olympic trials, you've made it through the trials, you do good work with your clients. Would you do me a favor and turn to the person next to you, shake their hand and say, "Dang good job!" Would you do that? 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)Just the facts man.

00:11:35
SCOTT MILLER, PH.D. Our field, unfortunately, suffers from terminally low self-esteem and it is not deserved. Our outcomes, once again, or on par, but if in this increasingly competitive atmosphere in which we live, if we want to survive, average is not going to be good enough anymore, so let's talk about this, because our success as a field has led to an explosion in the number of treatment models and choices, so we have over six . . . We've gone from 60 to over 400 different treatment models in the, in the last 50 years or so; 10,000 how-to books have been published during the same time period - now this is just a small editorial comment, but let me say any field that needs 10,000 books to describe what it's doing doesn't know what it's doing, but from the surface of it, just the number of books makes you impressed, it has to make you impressed, really. In addition, 145 manualized treatments for 51 of the 397 possible diagnostic groups in the DSM. If you go to the samhsa.gov website listing lots and lots of treatments that we can use, and again, from the outside, if somebody were to come from another planet, you would have to agree we've made a huge amount of progress, we really have. So many more treatments for so many more problems, etcetera. The problem with all of this is that when you compare the effect size going all the way back, when you (ph)care (ph)for the effectiveness of our work all the way back to 1976 when the first (ph)meta-analytic research was done all the way forward to 2011, there has been absolutely, absolutely no improvement in treatment outcome, none, ze- - excuse me - zero, zip, nada. There has been none. Uh, and that's very troubling when you think about how hard we've worked at it and when you compare it to other fields and endeavors. So if you look, for example, at the - my God - if you, if you look at the Olympics, for example, the, in the Olympics the performer, they perform, the outcome for every single Olympic event, every single one over the last 50 years has improved, in most cases by 50%. Let that sink in a little bit. We're talking here not only about swimming and figure skating, we're talking about the beer stein competition, you know? Even they've gotten better at it, um, and when you, again, if you think about it, today's best high school running time in the marathon beats the 1908 gold medal winning time by more than 20 minutes. I can't remember if it was last year or the last, uh, the year before that, a 78 year old man beat the 1912 gold medal winning time in the Chicago marathon by four minutes. In other words, they are running faster. Us? No improvement. You know, it's a drag, really, when you think about it. In, in the tour de treatment, we're riding on a stationary bike. We're pedaling like mad, we're just not going anywhere. At the end of it we're all sweaty but the scenery's the same. It's a drag , really, and it . . . We just deserve to get better at the work we do. Now let's take a look at this picture, by the way. Uh, this is some work during the same rough, same time period when psychotherapy as an art and science really exploded. These are pictures of ballerinas going back to the 1960s all the way forward to 2003 doing two different standard positions in ballet. Now, if you look at the leg position of those ballerinas, you're gonna know some, notice something over time. In other words, they have improved, they've gotten better; they've stretched their performance. Once again, us . . . No difference, uh, and the question, really, is why? Why is it that we're not getting any better at what we do, because heaven knows we've tried, heaven knows we do a lot of work, we spend more hours in our office than ever before, we read more books, there's no standardized continuing education across the United States. We deserve to get better, and the truth is most of us feel like we're better at the activity, so let me just ask you: how many of you think you're better at it than you were when you started? Come on. Yeah, of course you do. Those of you who aren't raising your hand, you're lying, uh, you're lying. We think we're getting better and (ph)Runastetten Orlinsky, a Norwegian researcher, and David Orlinsky, at the University of Chicago say that a sense of professional development is part, is necessary for our identity, otherwise we burn out in the field, so how is it that we haven't gotten better at what we do? It's a troubling finding when you think about it, um, and what could we do to improve it? The guy who's done the most in this particular area is the gentleman that Rich Simon just mentioned and that's a ge- . . . His name is K. Anders Ericsson. He's a Swedish psychologist living in warmer climes at the moment, Southern Florida, um, but he's done work for the last 30 years, and the truth is, as a clinician who's done therapy for now 20, 25 years myself, um, I, I didn't know anything about K. Anders Ericsson's work. I stumbled across it while reading a magazine in a flight home from Europe. Uh, he's a guy who works with uh, chessmasters, Fortune 500 companies and Olympic athletes, and he's done a huge study of why some of those people excel while the rest of us are average and he's written about it in his book, this book called The Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance. This is a massive tome - 890 double-spaced, 10 point font columns - and if you have a sleeping problem, this book is a phenomenal resource. Just open it up and you will be out like a light, and if reading it doesn't make you fall asleep, just take it and hit yourself in the head and you will be out for, like, a week, it's so, so big. In any event, he's been studying these experts in chess, music, mathematics, surgery, etcetera, and thanks to a phone call between him and us at our team, now he's looking at us as well, helping our team to study psychotherapists, and he has some ideas about why most of us remain average, and I want you to give it a moment's thought here, because many of us spend more time on the job than we do with our families, and the idea that we remain average over the course of our careers has to at least sting a little bit, and so he's done some research on this subject. Will you do me a favor? If you have a piece of paper and a pen, can you grab it real quick? Cuz what I would like to do is give a quiz, that's right. We can go down a little bit on the volume on the computer. I'll do it up here; you tell me. Uh, I think they're awake. Because what I'd like you to do is think about two thought questions here, two thought questions, and sometimes it's best if you write them down because people tend to change things in their mind, uh, when they haven't committed to an answer on paper, so if you're honest with yourself, great, no paper and pen needed. If you're, you know, if you're not, uh, then you probably wanna get that pen and paper out. Here's what Ericsson has asked people in various professions, and I'm going to ask you now, and I'd like you to give an estimate. Here is the question. Compared to other mental health professionals in your field with similar credentials, how would you rate your overall clinical skills and effectiveness in terms of a percentile, where 50% would be, uh, average; 75% would be above average; 25% would be below average. Where would you rate yourself? Just get that number in your head. Would you do that? Get the number in your head, write it down. All right, there ya go. Get the number in your . . . Okay. That's question number one. Here's question number two, 2-A. 2-A is: what percentage of your clients experience significant symptom relief or reduction? What percentage get better, in other words? However you might define it, what percentage get better from 0 to 100? That's question 2-A, 2-A. Question 2-B, 2-B is: what percentage stay the same? Now, if you can get it, we're gonna have 2-C and A, B, and C need to add up to 100, right? So 2-C is: what percentage get worse during treatment with you? What percentage get worse? Get those numbers in your head; make sure they all add up to 100. Are you ready? Because several colleagues of mine, Walfish, McAllister, and Lambert, they actually did this survey with people across the United States, a broad representative sample of psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, marriage and family therapists in every state in the Union. They asked them to estimate their effectiveness in the responses to these three questions. The first answer to the question was, or the first response, was, I think, uh, helpful and inspiring. Here's what they found first: no differences in how clinicians rated their overall skill level and effectiveness between the various disciplines. In other words, no particular discipline ad a corner on hubris or low self-esteem. We were all arrogant or, then, in trouble, um, so, and that's good news. It flies in the face of many of our assumptions about the different professional groups. Now let's take a look at your numbers and compare them to how everyone else made the comparison. Remember, the question here is why is it that most of us remain average rather than getting better? Here's what he found. He found that, on average, clini-, clinicians rated themselves at the 80th percentile in terms of their effectiveness. I want you to look at your answer to question number one, and if your number is above 50, really, it's statistically impossible because - look at this - the average clinician rated themselves at the 80th percentile. This is sort of like Lake Wobegon on crack, really. This is everybody looking in the mirror and saying, "Damn, that is really good." At the 80th percentile . . . If your number is at the 80th percentile, you're either really good or you need professional help, frankly, and if you think you're really good, this may explain, in part, why we are not getting any better. Look at the next one; none of themselves rated themselves below average . . . (inaudible) Where are all the below average people? I'll bet at home you could point to a few right in your community. Where'd they all go? Less is, less than 4% consider themselves average. Let that sink in. 4% considered themselves, uh, average. Uh, I mean, it's amazing. Only 8% rated themselves lower than the 75th percentile. That's amazing when you think about it. And 25% rated themselves at the 90th percentile or higher. Now, just so you know, we are in good company. Lots of people overestimate their ability. Drivers, for example, average driver thinks their better than 80% of the people on the road, all right? Would you like to know the group that overestimates their, their, their self-worth more than any other group? Would you like to know? Position's (ph)no? College professors. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why they live over there. Yeah, that's right. You can only maintain it that particular way. Well, with regard to success rates, let's look at question number 2-A, 2-A now, um, but what you, would the answer you gave. The average clinician believed that 80% of their sample improved as a result of being in therapy with them. Look at your number. If your number is 80%, again, you're really, really good or we need to strap you down, um, to a gurney and take you some special place. Um, nearly a quarter of the sample believed that 90% or more of their clients improved, nearly a quarter, and half, half of the sample reported that none of their clients deteriorated within their care. Interesting. Look at your number, um, and when we think about this, let's take a look and compare it to the average data that we have from monitoring therapist's outcomes because - that's right - it seems troubling, this data. Here's what we know. Effectiveness rates vary tremendously between clinicians, but in tightly controlled studies of effectiveness, the average clinician achieves a reliable change with about 50% of their clients. Now take a look at your answer to question 2-A. If it's above 50%, again, either you're really good there is an adjustment that needs to take place in our es-, esteem, uh, of, of ourselves. Number two, therapists, the data show us, consistently failed to identify in our, in our cases. 25%, 25 years of data actually indicate that about 10% of our clients deteriorate while in our care. So, if you'd look at question 2-C, if your number is lower than 10% you're probably missing clients who are deteriorating. The last person who did this work was Scott Hannan. Uh, Scott Hannan did a study in 2005. All he did was ask clinicians to identify on their case (ph)loads the clients that were getting worse. He told them the base rate. He said it's 10%. In this study, 500 clients were involved; 8% deteriorated - about 40; therapists in the sample identified one deteriorating case correctly. Are you getting the drift? And are you seeing where we might be able to improve where the edge of our performance is? Yes, we do great work. We do great work, we really do, but there are areas where we don't stretch our abilities over the course of our careers. Here's one of them: drop-out rates in our field average 47%. In other words, we do great work, but the people who stay, that's right, that's right . . . But half of our customers decide early on, "You know what? I'd rather be mentally ill than be forced to speak to you one more time." It's an inefficiency in the system that we could do better with, uh, and truly, we could do better with it. So the question really is why? Why haven't we gotten any better at it over time? And there are lots and lots of answers to it. Our team has been investigating this, talking to people like K. Anders Ericsson to figure out what's it going to take for us to get better. I should say one other little point, and that is that, uh, we're not alone. Paul Clement published a study in 1994 that I carried around with me for close to a decade because I found it so puzzling about why anybody would publish something like this. Paul was a psychologist who monitored the outcomes of his cases carefully before it became the thing to do. In 1994 he published 26 years of outcome data about his clients, and here's what he said. He said I had expected to find that I had gotten better and better over the years, but then, when he crunched the numbers . . . 

00:26:40
UNKNOWN Holy nightmare! 

00:26:40
SCOTT MILLER, PH.D. . . . he found that, that, in fact, his data suggested, suggested any improvement in his outcome over the 26 years in question. Now, I know what some of you are thinking. You're thinking, "Poor Paul." An outlier to the rest of us. I was talking about Paul at a conference in San Diego. A former student of his comes up and says, "Hey, do you know Paul Clement?" I say, "I really don't, but I just love this. I think he deserves, truly, a Nobel prize in psychology for being willing to publish this." He says, "Well, I, you know, I was one of his supervisees," he says. I said, "So you're not very good either, right?" I, I didn't say that. I thought it. I didn't say it. He says, "Would you like to meet him or talk to him someday?" I said, "I would be truly honored." He says, "Well let me have your card." I gave him my card and um, about three weeks later I got a brown envelope in my, uh, in uh, from him in the mail, and in that, uh, envelope was an article, Outcomes From 40 Years of Private Practice. Yeah, this is one anal dude, man, you know? This is a guy really following his outcomes. He publishes outcomes here . . . 40 years of results; 2,000 clients. Would you like to see what he found? If you're of a weak constitution, you may want to avert your eyes at this point. Here's what he found. He found not only had he not gotten better, he'd gotten worse. Yeah, something for the rest of us to look forward to, right? And it fits with all of the research on expertise and excellence stuff. You know that you've heard before, and that is, if you don't work at it, you lose it. It's just the nature of our knowledge base. It begins a slow and inexorable deterioration the minute you leave gradual school. Uh, it, it uh, it uh, it real, it really does. Ericsson basically says, for most of us, our development as clinicians arrests very early; it stops, and the question, of course, again, is why. Why does it stop, um, when we work at it as hard as we do, when we see as many clients as we do, but the findings come up again and again and again, which basically show little or no difference between professional therapists and students and minimally trained para-professionals. Let this sink in. Now, if this were one study here, I wouldn't talk about it, but I'm talking about a package, a group of growing number of studies that return these troubling findings. The most recent one was done by (ph)Scott Nyman, published in the Journal of Counseling and Development, a prospective study, actually followed psychologists, fully licensed, and students. No difference in outcome. For me, this has tremendous policy implications because, as Thomas Friedman said in a recent article, average is over, average is over. "Used to be you could do an average job and get an average job, but not now", Friedman said not a month ago in the New York Times, because employers have access to so much other cheap and above- average labor. Are you with me here? Let me give you a clue about this. The military, just this last week, Wednesday, announced, just this last week, that in their telehealth services they are going to ignore licensure. What does that mean? That if I'm licensed in Illinois, all I can really do is treat people in Illinois. What they're saying now is the treatment is done where the, where the client resides, not where the therapist resides. This is a huge step. Think of the implications here, because, if you live in Washington, D.C., your cost of living is higher than if you live in Kentucky. You're going to be competing with therapists in Kentucky who can return the same average results for less, so the idea that we need to push our performance to the next level is essential, is critical. Why is it that we don't get any better? Ericsson says that, you know, for most of us, we all start off with an equal potential of being good at what we do. We can be superior. We start in school, we complete our basic training, we go and start our work as an apprentice but then, Ericsson says, something awful happens. What happens is we strive not to make mistakes, and Ericsson says we succeed, and this is the problem. Without making mistakes, we do not come to the attention of our supervisors, trainers, people who know more about the business than us? Am I making sense to you about this? Ericsson talks more about having an error-centric culture. What we live in, however, is a risk-adverse error-phobic culture, where you don't want to let on to anybody that you've made a mistake for fear that you might get reported, you might get sued, or some other terrible thing happen to you. As a result, you strive not to make mistakes. We're wonderfully successful at this, and, within a very short period of time, automaticity, as he calls it, sets in. We develop a standard routine that we can do without thinking. Now, automaticity isn't bad. Automaticity is good. Couldn't walk, couldn't hold a conversation if you were not automatic. The problem is our automaticity leads to an inflated sense of confidence. Simply because you've fall, haven't fallen down doesn't mean you're getting better at walking day after day after day, and so what happens is supervision, d-, and supervision and training decrease, how soon does this happen, in our field, that we achieve stable average outcomes? Are you read? 50 hours of direct service. You . . . Yeah, yeah, and then it's the same after that for the next 50 years. The good thing is that, over time, uh, as we go, our confidence increases. That's the drag about all of this. As Ericsson is prone to say, the enemy of excellence is proficiency. Kahneman, in this wonderful new book called Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow, says that we are a, our usual ways of thinking are lazy. We have a very sophisticated inferences that we draw, and thinking deliberately about stuff takes an enormous sense of, uh, an emor-, an enormous amount of energy, so we avoid it at every turn if we can. We get good at it and that causes us to stop thinking. We don't think - here's the puzzle - we don't think we've stopped thinking. We think we're continuing to think and get better at it as we go along.

00:33:30
SCOTT MILLER, PH.D. So what we've done in this exp-, in our work is start to study the people, who seem to, as you heard Rich say, get superior results, uh, Supershrinks, as they've been termed. I want you to know I didn't think up this term, although it's quintessentially Scott Miller-esque. I didn't. Uh, a guy named David F. Ricks, a psychologist in New York thought up this term when he published a paper in 1974 on this topic. He was following adults who had been treated as children in the New York state mental health care system, and he found that some of these adults, treated as children, went on to live productive, successful lives; other kids continued to struggle. Uh, they had mental health problems where in the justice system, etcetera, and he wanted to know what was the difference between the two groups, so he interviewed them, followed them up. Turns out that who treated the kid accounted for the difference in outcome. If they were retreated by this clinician they were better; if they were treated by that one, they were not. Are you with me? The kids called the successful therapists Supershrinks. It was them who coined the term, and when new kids would come in the system they would say, "Make sure you see Dr. So-and-so. He's a Supershrink. And stay away from Dr. So-and-so. He's a stinker." Who treats the client . . . Now, how many of you think that there are therapists who just seem to be unusually talented and gifted at what they do? How many of you think it's you? Yeah. Okay, that's it. That's harder after the sort of lead in in the uh, conversation. We've been interviewing these people, these uh, top-performing therapists, not me, but a whole variety of people. One of them is this gentleman right here. His name is Bill Andrews. Bill Andrews is a clinician in the UK. He runs the Practice Research Network. He's been tracking the outcomes of literally hundreds and hundreds of clinicians using, uh, valid, reliable, measurement tools, and look at Rich, as Rich (ph)into said, at the top quartile of clinicians, not one year, not in their imagination, in real hard data, from year to year, folks who achieve positive outcomes, and one of the people he, he's uh, interviewed, uh, we have interviewed on film later. She is a truly remarkable therapist. Her outcomes place her at the 92nd percentile in terms of effectiveness. Again, not in her imagination, uh, in reality, plus she doesn't work with the worried well, so-to-speak. Uh, not that there's anything wrong with that, but she works with a very challenging population: folks who have are, have a background of trauma, immigrants who have come who've been tortured in their country of origin, and this is a person who achieves good outcomes. Would you like to see what she looks like? We call this Supershrink next door, and the reason is you would never be able to pick them out of a crowd. They're not usually holding a microphone like me. In fact, I'm just gonna admit to you right now I'm not a Supershrink, I'm not. I've been tracking my outcomes for about 12 years; I'm an average therapist. That's right. I'm average. That's why I'm here doing the lecture. That's right. Yeah, yeah, if I could do this - (ph)shit - I'd stay home. So he's gone and he's interviewed, uh, (ph)Wendy, and here's the (ph)clee, key as you watch Wendy and highlight some of the things that Rich was bringing up. As you listen to her, Wendy doesn't know what we know about her. We have not told her how effective she is. We have not told her that what we know about what makes her uniquely effective. We are listening, uh, to her interview through the lenses of Ericsson's work, but Wendy is simply talking to us. Here is what Wendy looks like. She lives in Birmingham, England. Um, would you like to hear what she has to say? When we asked her "how effective are you?", here's what she said. 

00:37:35
[sil.] 

00:37:40
WENDY I think that I'm actually an average therapist. 

00:37:45
SCOTT MILLER, PH.D. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wendy thinks she is . . . 

00:37:50
AUDIENCE Average. 

00:37:50
SCOTT MILLER, PH.D. The rest of us think we're Wendy. 

00:37:55
[sil.] 

00:38:00
SCOTT MILLER, PH.D. Think about that. She thinks she's average. Now, when people watch this, they often . . . I have to admit I thought the same thing. "Oh, humility is part of this game." That's not what Wendy means at all. She means she's average. "I'm an average clinician who simply works harder at it because I am average." Let's keep watching here. 

00:38:25
WENDY I'll tell you why: um, because what I bring to the (ph)set . . . Well, what I am is an average therapist who doesn't actually think she's better than she is; that's the first thing. Um, if ever I start to think I know what I'm doing, I end up with the most awful bloody nose, so I try desperately hard not to do it, but, to me, it's because I want the best for the clients. I'm not . . . I, I absolutely, I'm more focused on picking up with what's not going right. (crosstalk)What . . . 

00:38:55
SCOTT MILLER, PH.D. (crosstalk)Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What did she say? She's focused on what? What's not going right. She has an error- centric focus; the rest of us look for what we're doing right. As a result, we suffer largely from the fundamental attribution error; we look for confirmation of our effects rather than disconfirmation. It's hard, especially in our work, because we're balancing empathy, which the purpose of which is to align with the other person, but that empathy must be tempered, scientifically, for, for, for, from our particular perspective. She says, "I'm focused on what's not going right"; she's looking for disconfirmation rather than validation of her beliefs. 

00:39:40
WENDY "That's not working". And I don't always have the answer; in fact, frequently, I don't, but I think about it, I get the information, I engage with the client, and then, if I don't, if I'm not kind of coming out with what that client needs then I talk to people. 

00:40:00
SCOTT MILLER, PH.D. Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh. Now this is the other piece that Rich was mentioning. She . . . Wendy has a huge community of people around her that she organizes specifically to get help. She's constantly calling people, she's going to tell you. In fact, her colleagues call Wendy annoying because she's on the phone asking them . . . Listen to what she asked them about. Here's what she says. 

00:40:25
WENDY I'm, I must be one of the most prolific talkers in the group. I will phone people and say, "Look, I've got, I've got a problem." 

00:40:35
SCOTT MILLER, PH.D. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Who's got the problem? Wendy. She says, "I've got the problem." Now, Wendy has no idea - I don't believe - of what she's saying here. We're viewing this through the lens of Ericsson, and she says, "I've got a problem", as opposed to, "I have a client with a problem." It's all about her "I've got a problem," plus she locates the problem in an interesting space. Here's where she locates the problem. 

00:41:00
WENDY Um, I don't seem, we don't seem to be getting on as well as I'd like. 

00:41:05
SCOTT MILLER, PH.D. Where does she locate it? In the relationship, in her ability to engage this client. This is a word she's gonna use over and over again, engagement. "I need to engage this particular person." She views it as her job. You would never hear Wendy say, "My client is in the pre-contemplative stage," you would never hear it, and if you heard a comedian say that, you had a, you went to a comedy show tonight here in Washington that you, you don't laughs and respond to the comedian's joke and then you, he doesn't know his microphone's still on and he goes backstage and says, "The audience was in the pre-contemplative stage of laughter." You'd be pissed off, really. Wendy doesn't locate it there. She locates it in her . . . Let's keep going. 

00:41:45
WENDY "What do you think? Have you, have you got any ideas for me on this?" I'm constantly talking to people and I'm constantly getting information that I can use. 

00:41:55
SCOTT MILLER, PH.D. Wendy relies on a community of people to help her out, people who can give her ideas. She doesn't care what the idea is. She's just looking for information. In fact, she refers to herself as a conduit, really. Expertise is not located inside, but in the quality of the connections she has outside of the consulting room. In fact, this was one of the confusing things when we first started studying expertise, because what we did, like everybody else, is we watched videotapes of people like Wendy. We said, "Can you show us some examples of your work?" And I just wanna tell you what my experiences of watching videos of Wendy work: I thought it was crap. It wasn't elegant, it wasn't beautiful, no systemic questioning, no movement of the hands back and forth, no tapping, no pet scans . . . What the hell is going on in here? Instead, instead, Wendy locates expertise outside the consulting room, in her planning and reflection and her connection with other clinicians in the community. 

00:43:00
WENDY So I see myself as a conduit, almost. I, I'm not, I do not see myself as a brilliant therapist; my brain doesn't work that fast; my, my memory is quite limited . . . 

00:43:15
SCOTT MILLER, PH.D. This is when I started to feel hopeful. 

00:43:25
WENDY I'll sometimes say, "Well, you know, this . . . I've got just the thing here but, (inaudible ) I can't remember what it was." But I, I think because I'm passionate about helping them the best way I can and helping them means getting the help I need when I need it and being very open to all of the experiences out there, very, very open to it and constantly engaging with people, constantly learning, constantly coming up with other ideas that, um, I can maybe bring to it. Um, I put my energy and time with a client on just getting on side with the client, getting them on side, and then, thankfully, when you get that, you can make mistakes, because I do, but you can get over them because you've got, you're both on board. 

00:44:25
SCOTT MILLER, PH.D. We're both on board, we're on the same side. How did we get there? We looked for disconfirmation of our beliefs and looked at our mistakes; we connected to a broader community - whether you do that through the excel groups on the Networker website or the ICCE, connecting to the expertise in the room is what starts this journey. Thanks so much for listening to me these last 45 minutes. 

00:44:50

00:45:00
RICH SIMON I think you've just heard . . . This is the voice of the new wisdom, the new wisdom is not some special knowledge that somebody has somewhere on a mountain top. This new wisdom is this humbling awareness that life, if your gonna do something well, it's gonna take work, and you have to be in touch with reality and not your preconceptions. Thank you, Scott. You've just expressed the conference's theme so perfectly. All right, so go off in pursuit of the new wisdom. Uh, I look forward to seeing some of you tonight at the dinner.
