RONALD F. LEVANT  What we're here to talk about today is the psychology of men and masculinities in multicultural perspective. And this is a continuation of a, ah, dialogue that, ah, was actually held at the last multicultural summit. And it's, it really is, uhm, an invitation, to continue this discourse between communities that have been working largely apart from each other. I'm referring to the community of psychologists who studied boys, men and masculinity on the one hand and then the community of psychologists, ah, of color as represented by APA's Division 45, the APA Committee On Ethnic Minority Issues, ABPsy, the Asian American Psych Association, the National Latino, Latino Psychological Association and the Society of Indian Psychologists. Now, although, the Community of Psychologists of boys who have been studying boys, men and masculinities have had among the ranks psychologists of color and although some of these psychologists have also been involved in, in the communities of psychologists of color. These two communities, prior to the last multicultural summit, have by at large not really interacted with each other, uhm, in terms of attending each other's programs, reading each other's journals, and we're trying to see if we can change some of that and begin greater interaction. Now, I personally, am Ron Levant, I've long been associated with this, the psychology of boys, men and masculinities. I was the co-founder with Gary Brooks, who's in the audience. Say hi to Gary. Uhm, and, and I was the first president of Division 51. I recognize, uhm, I think as to many members of Division 51, that in American psychology, the study of human beings has historically been the study of males which usually meant, white heterosexual, able-bodied males, namely, the most privileged group in our society. And Division 51, when it started over ten years ago, put forward a new psychology in men which we explicitly, ah, put forward as pro-feminist, gay affirmative, and informed by multiculturalism. And we have from the start been inclusive of cultural diversity in a variety of ways, for exam, including, for example, having dedicated seats on our boards of directors for, ah, ah, people of color, women, gays, lesbians and bisexual individuals. And I initiated this program because I think it's important to keep this dialogue open. Some very important things here happened last year. By the way, how many of you were here at the last, ah, meeting of this? Okay, so some of you know, we started some, some, opened up some areas and we'd like to continue that. And we also recognize that an invitation is bidirectional, that of, involves both the offering and acceptance of the invitation. And thus, an extending this invitation we're, ah, we're hoping that communities of psychologists of color would want to engage with the community of psychologists concerned with boys, men and masculinity. So we're looking for an RSVP from you, in which you would respond to what we've said and also share what we stimulated in, in you today. Our goal really is to illustrate the potential that this kind of dialogue would have to deepen and enrich our understanding of the psychology of masculinities among boys and men of color. Ah, we would like to be able to articulate how boys and men of color are negotiating gender and racial role strain and coming away with a healthy sense of masculinity. We would like to understand what the salient issues are that African American males struggle with, what the contextual parameters are that Asian American males face, what other cultural conditions that frame Latino masculinity and Indian masculinity. Now, the formula we're gonna be following is, uhm, a little bit different, uhm, each of us are gonna speak from our own perspectives for about five minutes and laying out some of the content expertise that we bring to this program. But we recognize that you, the audience, ah, also, brings a lot of expertise. So we've reserved about an hour and a half for discussion and in the first hour, we'd like you to kind of react to the material that we put forward staying within the framework of race and gender really focusing on even the last half hour, we broaden that out to include other dimensions of diversities such as sexual orientation, age, religion, social class, disability, status, et cetera. And we've also prepared some stimulus questions. Now, as a psychologist of boys, men and masculinities, I wanna put forward the outline of, ah, kind of a conceptual model that I think might be useful in, ah, trying to examine multiple dimensions by identity and I call it the general role strain paradigm. And role strain is a concept, most of us are, are familiar with it, refers to the process whereby, that's not it yet (inaudible ). Uhm, role strain refers to the process whereby social roles that are embedded obviously in power hierarchies, and that, that are communicated by ideologies creates strain for marginalized groups in our society and in the new psychology of boys and men, the gender role strain paradigm has been the guiding framework for theorizing and for research as well as clinical practice and I think it might have more general applications so I and some other, Robert-Jay Green, Shamin Jaffer, uhm, and Bryant Smalley, proposed that the role strain construct be broadened to apply to various categories of cultural diversity and now we're ready for the first slide. Okay. Thank you. Sorry. (laughs).So, gender role strain is due to the inequalities of power and opportunity in a patriarchal and sexist society even when it has been partially softened by feminism; race and ethnicity role strain will be defined as, uhm, strain resulting from the inequalities of power and opportunity in a racist society even when partially mitigated by the Civil Rights Movement of the '60s and its heirs; sexual orientation role strain is due to the inequalities of power and opportunity in a heterosexist society even when partially mitigated by the LGBT movements; social class role strain is due to the inequalities of power and opportunity in a classiest society even when partially mitigated by democratic movements; age role strain is due to the inequalities of power and opportunity in an ageist society even when partially mitigated by the Gray Panther Movement; disability role strain is due to the inequalities of power and opportunity in an able-bodied society even when partially mitigated by the disability movements and so on. I mean, I've just, I stopped here but you can keep going with this. Now, these specific role strain models have yet to be developed. That's the challenge. But to illustrate how they can be developed, I'm gonna take a moment to bri, briefly outline the gender role strain paradigm which has been fully developed and used for the last 15 years in research and clinical practice. Uhm, let's see. Is it that one? Yup. We're not quite there yet, but that's okay. The gender role strain paradigm begins with the acknowledgement that gender roles are socially constructed to serve the paper, uhm, ah, the purposes of a patriarchal society namely, one that is male dominated. Hence, the norms of the male role, as, ah, put up on a slide there, ably by my colleague Doug McDonald, uhm, are that men, ah, should be dominant, these are norms, these are prescribed norms, dominant, independent, aggressive and unemotional, that men avoid all things feminine, reject homosexuals and have a non-relational orientation of sexuality, which means that a man does not have to like the person to have sex with them or having in a relationship with them. On the other hand, the norms of the female role as prescribed in, in, ah, traditional femininity ideology, are that women should be submissive, dependent, emotional and nurturant. They would be, they should be concerned with their body image and have a relational orientation of sexuality. Now, these traditional norms, uhm, can be measured in fact, are being measured in various studies and what we're(ph) finding is that in United States, uhm, the, the norms are changing. Women tend to reject, ah, most, different groups, subgroups, I mean, most of the traditional male role norms and men are even rejecting some of them, themselves, so it's rare for, ab, a, a group of men to really, wholeheartedly endorse traditional masculinity ideology. Uhm, ah, what seems to be happening is that men are trying to redefine a healthy sense of masculinity that does not rely on marginalizing other groups or other people. Uhm, also, what we found in some of the researches that traditional masculinity ideology and associated constructs like gender role conflict are associated with the range of negative mental health and health options including an aversion to seeking, ah, psychological help. Now, the gender role strain further proposes that contemporary gender roles are contradictory and inconsistent. The proportion of persons who violates gender role is high. Violation of gender roles leads to com, condemnation and negative psychological consequences that the actual or imagined violations of gender roles leads people to over conform to them. Ah, violating gender roles has more severe consequences for males and for females, and certain prescribed gender role traits, like male aggression or one of my favorite constructs, a normative male alexithymia, which means the inability to put words into emotions, a, are often dysfunctional. Now in this paradigm, appropriate gender roles are determined by the prevailing gender ideologies which you can measure in a society operationally defined by the norms and stereotypes and these gender ideologies, ah, inform parents, teachers and peers to shape the behavior of the developing child to conform to the norms of the, ah, extend ideologies. Now, the gender role strain paradigm has been very useful, both empirically and clinically, in defining and measuring, uhm, traditional masculinity and traditional femininity ideology and, ah, the three varieties of gender role strain which, ah, are dysfunction strain, discrepancy strain, and trauma strain, and also in designing new therapies for boys and men and in attempting to develop healthy conceptions of masculinity. So, to illustrate the potential u, utility of a gender role strain, I, I wanna kinda close with the beginning sketch of how a race, ah, s, ah, role strain model might look applied to men. The ra, race ethnicity role strain paradigm will begin by acknowledging that racial and ethnic roles are socially constructed to serve the purposes of a racist society. As Jack Dovidio's research shows, although explicit racism is rare today, implicit racism is, is in fact alive and well, as, uhm, as, ah, Derald was talking about earlier this morning that a lot of people are racists and don't know it but it shows up in their choices when they do psycho, social psychological experiments. Hence, says, my colleague, William Liu has put a dominant white, also called hegemonic masculinity as premised on the exclusion and marginalization of men of color. The dilemma then for men of colors, how do you subscribe to the dominant masculine norms and develop a positive sense of masculinity when these masculine norms themselves, inherently marginalize and denigrate these men? Now we know from Claude Steele's research in stereotype threat, that people of color learn the negative stereotypes which can be invoked in certain testing conditions leading to anxiety and performance decrements for people of color. So, so our preliminary questions are these. How do men of color negotiate these binds? What are the strengths they draw from? Do they seek out and reinforce minority notions of masculinity as a way that buttress are coping in a White dominant environment? As Richard Majors suggested young African American males do in his concept of cool pose and finally, how do they negotiate between these two views of masculinity? All right. Now, I'm gonna turn next to our next presenter.

WILLIAM LIU  Uhm, like Ron was saying, for many men of color especially for Asian American men, the history of masculinity shows that for the most part, dominant masculinity is premised, buttress on this idea of the exclusion of men of color, ah, through either legalized exclusion marginalization or through a task or implicit, uhm, ah, killing of men of color to support the normalization of white masculinity as the normative ideal and prototype of how men should be. The problem of course is that for many men of color especially for Asian American men, how do you get retained, obtained, ah, subscribe to a sense of yourself, ah, in terms of the dominant sense of masculinity when inherently, within that idea of masculinity, you are marginalized? Uhm, for many Asian American men, I think one of the, uhm, problems that, ah, one of the limitations of the dominant models that we have right now for masculinity is that it does not include or does not fully integrate, ah, the issues of racism into how men of color, especially Asian American men, deal with their masculinity. Ah, the reason I come to this is because for many years, I used to teach Asian American studies and, uhm, and, work with Asian American men and, excuse me. A lot of Asian American men, invariably most of them, ah, all of them being undergraduates, ah, in my classes, one of the issues that those come up that they wanted to talk about was the issue of interracial dating and the idea of sexual agency and sexual potency. It's about interracial dating and, uhm, for a lot of the Asian American men, when this issue came up in my classes, they certainly were very much different than Asian American women in the class. The Asian American women, for the most part, ah, didn't find anything wrong with interracial dating, in part because in a patriarchal society, and for ah, sex is patriarchal society, their sexuality, their agency revolving around sexuality was very much exoticized, is very much co-opted. It was currency for them whereas for Asian American men, it was marginalized and, and they were essentially relegated to a position of impotence. Uhm, I don't have a lot of time so I don't wanna sort of get into the, the background theoreticals of, of, uhm, my proposition. But one of the things that I wanna propose is this intersection between masculinity, ah, sexuality and racism and, ah, ah, it's a term that I'm sort of still toying around with, which is this issue of sexual, sexualism, which is for men of color or for Asian American men, uhm, in particular. They weren't just marginalized historically and contemporarily because they did well in school or they, ah, worked hard which is, part of the problem historically for their marginalization but they're also marginalized and excluded based on their, ah, perceived sexual potencies, perceived sexual agency. Uhm, so was, what is potentially one of the, uhm, most powerful ways to, ah, make Asian American men feels though they aren't sexually, uhm, uhm, wanted in society is to, one of the ways of course is to use stereotypes to, ah, denigrate their position in society. Now one of the stereotypes that I wanna propose to you, is probably, a current day, but very pernicious, but also something that's reoccurred throughout society, throughout, ah, American History, is, uhm, this image today that we see is of William Hung. And if you don't know William Hung is, William Hung was, ah, one of the worst losers on American Idol and I didn't even see it. However, he has become the, uhm, modern day Asian American equivalent of Black minstrelsy(ph), ah, for, for a society. And for many Asian American men, seeing that, ah, and I've had discussions about this issue which is that some Asian American men feel as though it's a positive image showing that, ah, he's being accepted. He doesn't speak great English. He's sort of quirky looking and that's great. But the reality is, is that the way they have, uhm, uhm, marketed him is of, of, what I'd consider modern day minstrelsy(ph). It, it's, it really is a sense of, of making fun of his potential sexual agency. If you've ever seen and I'd suggest that you try to see this, ah, one of his, uhm, uhm, music videos it, his music video is dramatically different than probably any other racialized music video that you'd see out there, wherein the man, the principal actor, the principal person in that, ah, video, tends to, uhm, ah, is allowed to engage in some kind of sexual connection with the women in the, in the video, whereas for him, if you've ever seen it, he's very much made impotent. I mean it, it, it is part of what sells that particular video and that particular, ah, person. So, I wanna end with that. I just, ah, point of provoc, ah, provocation for us in our discussion that, uhm, as much as I had hoped that we had moved away from some of these stereotypes of Asian American men, they constantly come up. And of course, one of the most modern day ones, ah, the reinvention of the, ah, a sexually effeminate, Asian American man is, William Hung. So that's the end of my comments for today. Thanks.

DOUG MCDONALD  [non-English narration]. I give greetings and maybe even more importantly, welcome to everyone that has, ah, honored us by joining us today. And I wanna express, ah, my sense of honor to, ah, be seated with, with, ah, brothers such as these. I, ah, my name is Doug McDonald. Ah, I opened and greeted you in the Lakota language, the language of my father, of, of our tribe, the old Lalalakota from South Western, South Dakota. I, first of all, would like to suggest something that any self-respecting person of American Indian heritage should always suggest and that is that I do not speak for all Indian people, certainly not all Indian men. We have still over 700 distinct tribal entities and cultures and ethnicities, and even if it were possible I would not be the best choice by any means. (laughs) When I first opened the email from Ron, ah, abo, a, about the potential for this and was scrolling down and said that, ah, some of the extent that, that I've been asked to, ah, ah, recreate or, or re, revise the difficult dialogue from two years ago and on, and on, oh shit, here we go again. (laughs) But, but my trepidation was not because of the intensity. And those of you that were here, male and female, will, will remember the intensity or as Dr. Joe White, uhm, proud to call, ah, uncle calls the vibe, ah, that was in that room. It was very powerful, it was very tense, uhm, but it was also very healing, very ca, ca, cathartic. It wasn't that, that I was, ah, ah, leery of that. It was more so the, the, the subject i, i, in terms of trying to speak and, and articulate some sense of masculine, the, the relationship and the notion of masculinity and American Indian men because in trying to do so, as it is were certainly with all of us, i, i, it's a very complex and very complicated notion, uhm, you know, masculinity and American Indian males. And in, in thinking about it, there are couple of aspects to the complexity and into the, the confusion, even if you will, that, that I'd like to highlight for, for my few seconds 'coz Lord knows that what's more important is what's gonna come after and not, not the, ah, presentations although, Dr. Parham and Dr. Vargas are gonna rock(ph), Va, Vazquez (inaudible ), sorry Luis. First of all, there's a historical aspect to, ah, masculinity in American Indian men, historical in the sense that if you, we have words to describe what it used to be like, ah, it used to be the things like akichita(ph), which in the Lakota language, and interestingly enough in Ojibwe too which are two totally separate languages. It means the same thing which is essentially warrior, although it's much more than that, a, a sense of being a warrior and we talked about this in Toronto when we did, ah, the second run of this, essentially, not just being fierce and war-like but also being unchika(ph) which literally translated as pitiful or, or humble but that's not really it either, it, it's more so being, being, being proud, being centered and, and in harmony not just within oneself but within the, the tiospaye or the family group or the clan between men and women, all the men and women and certainly between men, ah, ah, oneself and the other men. So history is a big part of it and, and then certainly history in terms of what has happened to American Indian people over all and certainly American Indian men in terms of signing all those treaties that, ah, gave us those free government checks every month, right, and other fallacy that, ah, in, in order for us to say, ah, to, to give up, ah, ah, ah, hostilities, then essentially we were stuck on reservations or in urban Indian centers and stripped of, of every, everything that for thousand of years had idented, had defined our identity as a people and that includes masculinity then, that includes akichita(ph) and unchika(ph) because then when you take, you say you can't sun dance anymore, you can't, you can't practice your, your, ah, spirituality and your traditions and your customs and your oral history. I'll get wiped away and you're going to boarding schools, whatever it means to be a man and to be masculine goes along, right along with that identity so history is very important. There is the personal aspect to the complexity, now, certainly by all means to the extent that, that I would offer that day, ah, a healthier man, mind, body and spirit has a more clearly defined and healthy notion and aspect of what it is to be masculine and what it is to be a man and how to relate appropriately with women and with other men and children and certainly the elders, so the, the personal aspect is very important as well and of course the flipside of, of the health, ah, the, the un-health that causes these misinterpretations and certainly, certainly true for American Indian men that, ah, to be tougher, to be stronger, to be macho means to hurt or to hit. Ah, that's not being unchika(ph) and it's not being akichita(ph) either and then of course, the, the personal learning history. What kind of a family did you grow up in? Were you taught your traditions? Were you taught your, your culture? Were you, were you taught your language? And then lastly, the, ah, the social aspect whether were talking about SCS, social standing, interactions with, with one's family group that, in, in terms of the ceremonial or, or, ah, how one walks and lives their life amongst their people. I would close at my presentation which is the, the, se, the suggestion essentially that masculinity and American Indian men nowadays, like I say, ah, contemporary United States, par, parallels many other aspects of identity as I've spoke of either positive or negative or, or good or bad to the extent that if we frame it in the works of Oetting and Beau-vais, uhm, Orthogonal Theory of Biculturalism and our notion is that those that are more culturally competent in both realms so, ah, also with, ah, to some extent with what Derald was talking about this morning, that not only are they going to exhibit less psychopathology but they have an idea of what it means to be akichita(ph) and unch, unchika(ph) as well. I would also like to finish by, it, it hasn't quite been brought up yet but, but it needs to be brought up, that what's gonna happen when we're done talking, and like I suggest is much more powerful and much more significant than, than the actual presentations themselves, to the extent that if, let, let's not waste any time, let's not waste any time, get into where we were two years ago, ah, worried about, ah, respectful, being respectful of, of all of our, and where we come from and our families and our backgrounds but by the same token, ah, ah, let it, let it hang on, so let's get there. [non-English narration]. 

00:26:50
BILL PARHAM  Good afternoon everybody. How's everybody doing? Good, everybody enjoying the conference? As a little side bar comments, I needed to hear that and we'll check in. I wanna talk a little bit about African American men, I also want to disclaim that, ah, I'm representing all of them but I think I have some things to say across the board. I'm entitled my three or four minutes, images and illusions, subtext that makes me wanna holler. Images and illusions of African American men are largely negative. Not only are they largely negative but they have us believing that success among African American men is an illusion. (inaudible ) some of the needles in radiance and even a Bill Cosby Show. The largest critics of the Bill Cosby show were African Americans. Hear me when I'm saying, had us believe that having two parents, upper class, well-behaved kids, college educated, a couple of mischievous activities, that's illusion there. Have us believe, that's a powerful, ah, microaggression, major aggression that has occurred and we're not even aware of that. These images and illusions and I concur with my brother, Dr. A.J. Franklin, who says, "They will always be around. Racism and oppression is never not going to be here." That's my reality and I take ownership for that. I could go on with the few minutes I had and, and I actually have a whole course on the disproportion of representation of African American men in prisons. And so the more of them, and there's more money spent on them than in schools, that's a fact. They are victims/a virus of poor schooling in uneducated, mostly under educated and those who are educated are not believing or are believing that their education is really, was gonna get them over. Poor health care that said, I can go on and on with the statistics. I can also talk about not only the major aggressions because trust me when I say, ladies and gentlemen, but the major aggressions are not historic, they are very much contemporary. Dragon(ph) James(ph) Burb(ph), behind a car to his flesh peels didn't happen in the '40s and the '50s itself. This is modern day America, land of the free, home of the brave. There are also microaggressions that African American put up with every day. And again, I'm not going to get on to a pity party about that because I have, I want to introduce for us to discuss later a different way of looking at that. A part of where we need to go in terms of an academic structure of all this is to beg, borrow and steal our way, away from, steal ourselves away from the comparative models that are out there. There is no compare, ah, model by which we need to compare ourselves as African American men. When you look at comparison models, they come up with notions of deficiencies, pathology and it assumes normalcy. But I began to ask myself the question a long time ago relative to the behaviors of African-American men across domains, parenting, school, work, et cetera. Are we really seeing in African American men pathological responses or are we seeing responses to pathological situations? I invite for you to consider that we are in fact seeing the latter. Racism and oppression is not accidental, ladies and gentlemen, it's a very deliberate, calculated and a lot of mean spirit. But where I wanna to go on the final two minutes is really suggesting agenda and one of reframing. And I want to borrow from two stories, both true, some of which you probably heard before, a couple of you, these are the two of you (inaudible ). But it captures for me an essence of what I wanted to get out and one is talking with my daughter when I was flying a kite one day and asked her, if she was on top of that kite, how big would daddy like? She's like, "Well, daddy, you look like a little guy." I said, "Sweetie, that's, and that's true." and if, if you went higher, what would happen?" She says, "Daddy, you'd shrink." I said, "That's absolutely true. Now, what is the only way I could get you down to where you and I are the same size?" She says, "Daddy, if you pull the string, if you pull me back home." I said, "That's true". And I tried to pull analogy, that and racism and oppression. I taught my daughter, you can't pull something down that's not already up. Well, we get pulled down with oppression, people doggin' you. We get caught in the tug, the string and that's what feels bad. Well, we have to train ourselves, ladies and gentlemen, and look beyond the tug and respect the elevation at which our oppressor has put us. You simply cannot pull something down that's not already up. And I invite all of us to consider that we in fact, have been up, have never been down and the oppressor knows that. I talk about the oppressor not in bad terms, I'm very forgiving. Because in essence, what the oppressor is doing for me in pulling me down is trying to elevate himself. He's trying to even out the playing field mentally, and psychologically and, and spiritually. His oppression as I have come to learn and accept as self-protective for him. Now, the way he's going about self-protecting does mean, violent and full of venom. And it's hard to say, you know, just let that roll off your back 'coz it penetrates your soul and to your bone and its generation. But I'm ultimate, optimism believing that we can, in fact, teach ourselves first and transmit that to our kids, that you can't pull something down that's not already up. The last image is that of the sunrise and sunset and most of you would know and believe and concur that you've seen sunrises and sunsets and that they're pretty in many places of the world, particularly here in California, mostly in Los Angeles, most because they're small here. But that, fact aside, and in fact, let me ask you. How many of you were up this morning to see the sunrise? Anybody up that early? Yeah, and how many think you're gonna' see the sunset tonight? Yeah, most of you. Any, anybody fallen in love at sunset? You know, going into a nice dinner with the boat rolling by, anybody in here? Anybody in love in here? Nobody's raising their hands. Alright, how many of you have fallen out of love at sunset, sunrise? A couple of you raised two hands, all right. Where am I going with this, ladies and gentlemen? In the fourth grade we learned the different reality, the reality we've learned, I learned, that the sun is the center of the universe. There are nine planets. Earth is the third rock from the sun and Earth does at least two things, it revolves around its own axis and revolves around the sun simultaneously. It's two spins. My question to you is, door number one is sunrise and sunsets. Sun rises in the East, sets in the West, all have you have been witness to the sun going below the horizon and coming up. Now, over here, door number two, will say the sun doesn't rise, it stands still. And the Earth moves around its axis and around the sun which, ladies and gentlemen, constitutes truth. It's not a trick question. The truth is door number two; you've never ever seen a sunrise or a sunset and never will because the sun doesn't move. You've been looking at illusions and constructing a life and a reality around that illusion all your life. The caviar(ph) I fill in here for some of you getting ready to get wrapped to at dinner time and sunrises and sunsets don't blow or cover of the guy or the lady trying to, ah, wrap to you. Just let them believe that the sun goes up and comes down. But what I want you to hear in my closing remarks is this, ladies and gentlemen, we've all been schooled as psychologists and mental health professionals in tabula rasa, that is the biggest lie perpetuated in our business. It's an interesting belief, it's not truth. It assumes that we come to this world empty and life is about filling us up. So, it invites us to develop a language of gain and lost, losing confidence and motivation and self-esteem. I don't believe it's possible to lose those psychic energies. My spirit tells me that we were born full to the brim with confidence, self-esteem, wisdom, so full we can't get another job and not a damn thing we can do to get rid of one iota(ph) of it. We are stuck with being wonderful, grand and glorious. The trick is, how do you tap that energy to get that person to discover the talent and the healing power they have within? Your sun will never set nor will it ever rise. So, moving these research agendas forward, it's important to us to, it's important for us to invite us, it's the entirety, it's important for us to think about, how have African American men and men of oppression survived all this long? In light of deliberate systematic attempts to wipe us off the face of the Earth. Back in slavery time, you don't legislate by penalty of death, to teach a slave to read if you knew and were promoting that he was so dumb, stupid and imbecile, he wouldn't go reading in the first place. That makes no conceptual sense. The fact is, they knew that that brother was gonna learn and learn well and do something productive with that knowledge that the oppressor couldn't handle. And we need to stop participating in the images and illusions that are constructed by the African American men and begin to ask ourselves, "Hhmm, they're still here and growing strong." Thank you.

LUIS VAZQUEZ [non-English narration] Ah, and what I'd like to say is good evening, I'm glad you're all here. " [non-English narration]. Who am I?" [non-English narration]. When I look at the mass media and they show the Latino male, Zorro, I wanna show me as," [non-English narration] Who am I?" [non-English narration]. When they show me, " [non-English narration]. Who am I?" When they, when they show me an American me, " who am I?" [non-English narration]. Or when they show me as George Lopez, " [non-English narration], who am I," at the Latino male. And for the first time, a Jimmy Smits running for president, I was sit, I was watching TV, I go, what happened? What happened? It could only happen in a TV series, "[non-English narration], who am I?" [non-English narration]. It is hard to depict. I do not speak for all Latino men but I will share my thoughts about being a Latino man. And of course, I cannot say anything without saying what? The word what? Machismo. For many of you know machismo as what? To be controlling, to dominate women, to do what we think. But I said, macho. Well, machismo also means, to be a caretaker, to be loving and to be there when your little boy or little daughter says, "Papi," and say, " [non-English narration]." To give that term of endearment when you grab 'em, you hold 'em. And the world that you know, that you face everyday [non-English narration] that you do not count. And then we go to the high schools and we see " [non-English narration], who am I?" When I see all our high school kids walking around with, with what I call an ethnic barometer, we strap it on to the side (inaudible ) put it right there, " [non-English narration]. Hey, hey, you're not one of us, you don't speak Spanish?" No, it is. Oh hey, you're not one of us. Why? You're too preppy; you're in the honors classes. Hey, you're not one of us. Why? Look at you, you want to do play this stuff, come on. [non-English narration] You're not one of us. Oh, you're not one of us. Why? (inaudible ) brother." "[non-English narration] You're not one of us." And so, we have this ethic barometer that we range ourselves as men. Going from all the way to the top as being what, is it okay to be a Latino male and when is it not? And when we cry as men, wha, ah, and when we cry, and we do, don't let us fool you. " [non-English narration]" And those are tears of crocodiles that we cry sometimes when we're by ourselves in the backyard and we're looking out at the mountains and what you get, of course, I'm from New Mexico. And you're looking at that purple mountain, majesty and you're looking out there and all of a sudden, tears come down as you reflect on the families, the kids. "[non-English narration], who am I?" When we, when I look at my Latina sister, who also works so hard, "[non-English narration], who am I?" "[non-English narration], who am I?" When I look at my, at my White colleagues, even at work and throughout the country, "[non-English narration], who am I?" [non-English narration], Dr. Vazquez [non-English narration]. My mother's 85 and says, yeah, that is my son. He knows to speak in, in English. I said, [non-English narration]. He's a doctor but doesn't give medicine. " Who am I?" By the way, we do have prescription pill, just in, in New Mexico now. (laugh) "[non-English narration], who am I?" And when I talk to my brothers and they tell me, my Latino brothers, "Man. How come they're educated Latinas, forget it. They come (inaudible ), they eat you alive." Who am I? And say, "Hey, that's my sister. Don't talk about my sister like that." And my daddy say, "[non-English narration], Do you know when domestic violence will stop? Do you know when rape will stop? Do you know when will we quit abusing each other? Do you know when we will be there for all our children at all times? Do you know when all these things happen? I said, "[non-English narration]" "Dad, tell me," he says, and my dad says to me, "When men hold men responsible for the behaviors that we participate in 'coz just as I teach you to be a caretaker, you too must take care, you too must cherish, you too must open your heart." "[non-English narration] who am I?" I'll attend with ah, a, a model by Rene Ruiz, 19, 1980, when, when he had this model who, who a Latino was. "[non-English narration], who am I?" And, and we start out but to start out I had to have a point of reference. From where? The majority culture. So, I can't define myself unless I know the majority culture to define myself from. That's our identity models. I can't move. [non-English narration] I can't move, ah, I can't go forward. Why? 'Coz I must experience the, the, all these discriminatory acts so I can become who I am. Let's begin the, ah, the identity model. We start out as individuals and we in, in the middle, we come together, and at the end we're back to individuals. " Who am I? [non-English narration]" Who am I? Is it okay for me to hug my kids? Yes it is. "[non-English narration], who am I?" Is it okay to cry with my children? Yes it is. "[non-English narration]" We, as men, need to come forward and say, hey, it's okay to cry, it's okay to hold each other, it's okay to share. [non-English narration] We are not alone. So men, "who am I?" We are men that are compassionate, we are men that care. And some of us need the help of others to straighten each other out, but we will do it together. Who am I? Soy Luis, a man who cares. Thank you.

RONALD F. LEVANT  Now, we've put together a series of stimulus questions and probably in the back of the room, you can't even read them 'coz I have a hard time reading it even from the front of the mo, room so I'm gonna try to read them to you. Uhm, first is, how do men of color subscribe to the dominant masculine norms and develop a positive sense of masculinity when these masculine norms inherently marginalize these men? How do men of color negotiate these binds? What strengths do they draw from? Do they seek out and reinforce minority notions of masculinity as a way that buttress are coping in a white dominant environment? If so, how do they negotiate between these two views of masculinity? And how does history and contemporary culture inform and unshape masculinities among men of color? And there are more.

RONALD F. LEVANT  How does the goal, global Diaspora of migration affect the, I'm sorry, impact the formation of masculinities among men of color in the US? What strategies for successful living can we learn about from senior men of color who grew up in an era that was more openly hostile politically, socially and economically? In what ways does a philosophy rooted in the beliefs and values of the community group versus an individual oriented philosophy contribute to the execa, execution of successful living strategies for men of color? How does the concept of machism, machismo pervade the popular discourses and research agenda in the US about Latinos? And Luis began addressing that. How does this discourse distract us from transgre, dre, sorry I'm getting tired too, from transgressing, creating other forms of constructing masculinities among Latino men and his relationship? So, at this point, we're going to turn to audience discussion. Ah, I understand the video is ah, ah, it's not be gonna be made of this part and.
