RICH SIMON Welcome, everyone. This is Rich Simon, editor of psychotherapy networker and welcome to this networker webcast series on treating anxiety. So, if there, uh, you'd be hard pressed to find a more common presenting difficulty than clients coming to our offices, struggling in one way or another with anxiety. And one of the interesting things that has happened in our field over the last ten or fifteen years is that for the first time we really have developed a much more fine-tuned understanding of the neurobiology of anxiety. How the nervous system works and how anxiety, we've gone inside the black box, we understand anxiety in new ways with a level of precision that previous generations of therapists did not. Uh, it is not always clear and it will apply this sometimes arcane neurobiological to psychotherapy and we're very fortunate to have someone who has spent a lot of time and trouble in mastering this material and looking at its applications for clinical practice. And, and without further ado let me welcome our guest for this conversation, Peg Wehrenberg. Peg, how are ya? 

00:01:30
PEG WEHRENBERG I'm good Rich. Hi. ice to see you. 

00:01:30
RICH SIMON So you, uh, amongst other things you've presented on anxiety around the county and you've written a book and, what began as an article for the networkers quite a few years ago, but, 10 techniques of anxiety, 10 best techniques of anxiety management. One of the most popular articles that we've ever published. Congratulations on that. 

00:01:55
PEG WEHRENBERG (crosstalk) Thank you. 

00:01:55
RICH SIMON So let's, lets, let's start off on, so what is it that we understand about the neural biology of anxiety that is it, is especially helpful to psychotherapists? 

00:02:10
PEG WEHRENBERG I think that the world of neurobiology can seem a little overwhelming, to, yeah, to anybody. 

00:02:15
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yes, sure. 

00:02:15
PEG WEHRENBERG I would put myself on that list too. But I think when we understand some basics about the brain and structures of the brain are involved in creating anxiety, we can be very helpful to our clients because we can communicate to them, first of all, that anxiety isn't an issue of being, lacking discipline to manager your mind, for example, Um, I also think that it helps our clients become persistent in doing anxiety management because they understand that the more persistent they are, the more likely they are to have success with getting rid of anxiety. So, understanding the brain a little bit and communicating that with our clients improves treatment outcome, basically. 

00:03:05
RICH SIMON Okay, so part of what you're doing and what we'll be talking about in this conversation is that you're giving clients information in the early stages of therapy that helps the alliance and gives the, the client an initial map of the territory that the, the two of you are working on and then I, we'll, we'll talk about the different varieties of anxiety and how this applies in, in particular applications of neurobiological knowledge in, in your work with a closer range of different kinds of anxiety problems and disorders. So, um, so talk to us, um, you've, uh, one of the things that you've, you talk about and you, we've talked about is the amygdala. Some of the imperfections of our nervous system in regards to anxiety and, and that old devil, the amygdala and how, how tricky that is and how a less than perfect, um, mechanism the amygdala can be. So talk to us about the function of the amygdala and the, the, and some of the excesses of the amygdala that lead to our struggles with anxiety. 

00:04:15
PEG WEHRENBERG Yeah, the amygdala is, uh, one of the brain structures that's, uh, fully operating when we're born and its registering all the information about the environment and it quickly registers things that aren't safe and it continues to serve that function to us, waking and sleeping, all of our life. So the amygdala, I talk about it sometimes as the smoke detector of the brain. 

00:04:40
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh huh. Okay. 

00:04:40
PEG WEHRENBERG That, that, it just says, uh oh! Smoke! There's smoke there! 

00:04:45
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Hey. Yeah. Okay. 

00:04:45
PEG WEHRENBERG Yeah and, and it doesn't have a lot of range about how loud it goes off. It can go quietly, it can go off very loudly but it's mostly registering first risks to our safety. The amygdala will also register things in the environment that are pleasant, stimulating, exciting but its first duty is safety so the first thing it registers is fear and, or, or the things that should make us afraid. And one of the challenges for many people who have a setup for anxiety, um, is you can actually see on brain scans, uh, people with panic or social anxiety tend to have an enlarged structure of the amygdala which means its oversensitive to threat. It sees more threat than really exists and, um, and the amygdala has, in that regard, kind of a learning disorder. Its learning what to be afraid of but in some cases it's so sensitive that its learning way more things than are actually dangerous. So, for example, um, you know, we think about physical safety with the smoke detector comes from danger from fire or smoke inhalation but to people in social settings one of the big dangers is the risk of being humiliated or somebody getting mad at you and so the amygdala is very over responsive to negative faces and that becomes a challenge to people with anxiety. They're overreacting to what is otherwise a safe situation. When people know that it's easier for them to talk themselves down from their fear. 

00:06:20
RICH SIMON Okay. So in a, in the, an early stage so let's say, I'm coming in. I'm a client with a panic disorder and I'm, uh, coming to you for treatment. In for some help. So, what's the conversation, what's likely to happen in a first session with you, uh, and particularly, what is, how are you likely to, uh, give me this information about how the amygdala and the, and the rest of the nervous system operates in a way that's gonna be useful to me. 

00:06:50
PEG WEHRENBERG Well, in the way that I just talked about it. I might share some of that. My biggest issue when somebody comes in right away with panic is to discern how they are trying to manage it because one of the things we know about fear is if you can avoid the things that you're afraid of, you won't feel afraid. So, I wanna know what people are doing to avoid panic. Okay. How are they changing their lives? Are they staying home? Are they avoiding certain circumstances like, um, it would be a very big impairment if a saleswoman was avoiding meeting clients face to face. 

00:07:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:07:30
PEG WEHRENBERG Uh, or somebody who had to travel for work started to become afraid of air travel and be- because they're afraid they might panic on the plane. 

00:07:40
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm hmm. 

00:07:40
PEG WEHRENBERG I'm not saying they're afraid of crashing but sometimes people get scared. 

00:07:45
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm hmm. 

00:07:45
PEG WEHRENBERG What if my panic hits me in the airport? 

00:07:45
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm hmm. 

00:07:45
PEG WEHRENBERG What if the TSA thinks I'm nuts but I'm really just having a panic attack. And so they start to avoid and the thing, the problem with avoidance of course is it works. If you can avoid what you don't wanna do because you're afraid you'll be scared, you won't be scared so you kind of get reinforced for avoidance. I wanna know what my clients are avoiding and then I talk to them about why fear gets triggered by the amygdala and how we're gonna start looking for the cues. 

00:08:15
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm hmm. 

00:08:15
PEG WEHRENBERG What are the cues? What are the triggers for panic or social anxiety in particular. 

00:08:20
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm hmm. 

00:08:20
PEG WEHRENBERG Um, when, when they understand that their brain is overreacting but that it's understandable, um, then what we wanna do is try to desensitize the cues and especially teach people how to stop panic when it's under way. How to calm down the fear that they're feeling. Um, and there are many techniques to do that but I want clients first of all to know, cognitively there's not a real threat. They feel like there's a real threat but there isn't. 

00:08:50
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm hmm. 

00:08:55
PEG WEHRENBERG So that's why understanding the amygdala and its reaction can be helpful. 

00:08:55
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm hmm. Now, how do people who have been in other kinds of psychotherapy, where they didn't get information about the brain and maybe, and they're coming to you, perhaps, because previous therapy wasn't so successful, what's some of the typical reactions as you begin to talk to them about the brain and just give them the sort of information that you've been discussing with us so far. How do they react? What do they say? What difference does it make for them? 

00:09:30
PEG WEHRENBERG There are always a few people who really don't care why they're anxious, they just want you to stop it, okay. But here are some people who feel so much better to say, oh, it isn't because I'm not disciplined or it isn't because I just am too weak to stop my fear. Um, the, the, and they can say, oh so there's a legitimate reason why, for example, even though I had a car accident a year and a half ago, there's a reason why I'm still having panic attacks today. And now that makes sense to me so I can, they can now cognitively approach their life a little differently which means less panic. They can say, ah, I just heard the sound of screeching tires but that's not really dangerous and then immediately I can start breathing and calming myself down and talking to myself that this is just an old reminder, or a reminder of an old situation. There's no danger right now. So it immediately changes the way they talk to themselves. Um, that's very important and then the other thing is that I, I talk with clients about the brain gets habits going and the more that you have, for example, panic attack or the more that you start to feel socially anxious and get that blushing, sweating response, the more often you will. Your brain kind of falls into that habit of responding. And so in therapy we're gonna create a new habit but the more often you interrupt the old habit and put the new behavior in, the more successful you'll be at stopping your anxiety and that requires persistence. Persistence is very hard for anybody but under- understanding why makes it a little easier. 

00:11:15
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. So in a, in a sense you're another analogy, uh, I suppose, I mean, what, is one school of psychotherapy. It's about insight, we have an understanding and life is for other change and there's, and they, the more cognitive behavioral schools, and that's primarily the way your, you think about anxiety, integrating this new information about the brain, it's really about practice. It's not about like, uh, athletic skills or musical skills or other kinds of skills, your, your, it's about the process of changing habits. 

00:11:50
PEG WEHRENBERG Well, I'm talking about managing the symptoms, absolutely. I do want, I do want people to understand that if there's an underlying traumatic life we're gonna work at trauma resolution in many different ways, not just the symptom management approach but I believe that when people get more control over their experience of anxiety they can stop their worrying, they can slow down their panic, they're able to sit through the more challenging parts of psychotherapy and in doing some of that inside oriented work, um, with not quite so many of the symptoms that they came in with. 

00:12:25
RICH SIMON Okay. So that might be a later stage of your work with the client. 

00:12:30
PEG WEHRENBERG Absolutely. But this is the beginning and its very cognitive behavioral. 

00:12:35
RICH SIMON Okay. So, now, is the beginning, uh, this, what you're saying about the brain, does it matter if I'm coming to see you and its, I have a panic disorder, I have a generalized anxiety disorder, um, if I have a social anxiety disorder? Does this initial stage, is it, is it that different what you might tell me, how you, what you might present to me about the brain? 

00:13:00
PEG WEHRENBERG Well, yes because if you, I should say probly not everybody is blessed with only one kind of anxiety. Sometimes we get to have more than one. 

00:13:10
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:13:10
PEG WEHRENBERG So I work with whatever is the most problematic first. I can have a client who has a panic attack every once in a while but their big problem is they're worried all the time and so I'm gonna start a little differently there. I'm gonna start talking about, um, if this is a client who's typically a high drive, go getter, type A kind of person, I'm gonna start talking to them first about high drive. How there's a part of their brain called the basal ganglia that maybe its very connected to connecting emotion and uh, thought in creating motivation. It's about having high energy. It's about being vigilante to the environment if we have a little more norepinephrine than we need and in the basal ganglia if you don't have real effective action from a neurochemical called GABA, that's the brain's slow it down a little bit. Calm it down neurotransmitter. If you don't have real effective GABA and you're blessed with high drive norepinephrine you're chance of developing generalized anxiety is much higher because you already have this sort of keyed up system. Um, I, I ask clients, would anybody describe you as wired? Or high strung? 

00:14:25
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh huh. Uh huh. 

00:14:25
PEG WEHRENBERG This would be behavioral evidence that maybe you have a little bit more of that norepinephrine than you really need. It, it, in the United, and I explain to people, in the United States high drive is highly rewarded. People are not rewarded for being, go with the flow. They are rewarded for being the salesperson of the month, the student of the year, you know, the prize winner of the county fair. They wanna be high achievers at, and in our culture all that gets rewarded. So I wanna say there's a lot of pluses for being a high drive person but the big downside from having an abundance of norepinephrine, which, by the way, you can have for a lot of reasons. You could be born that way. You could have created that condition by poor self-care. You can also stimulate it by over caffeinating, under sleeping, other things. So there are lots of reasons but if you end up in this kind of driven state you're gonna be a worrier, much more likely than if you're type B laidback person. 

00:15:25
RICH SIMON Mm hmm. Okay. 

00:15:25
PEG WEHRENBERG Why do we need to know that? Because, uh, when you're like that you tend to ruminate. You tend to go over and over and over and over the same information and its worry information, what if I lose my job? Over and over in your mind. You're literally creating a neurobiological rut in your brain. You're creating a pathway in your brain that makes it easier every time you're just sort of wandering along in your thoughts. It's easy to fall into the worry rut. And I want clients to know that, A, you're likely to be that way if you're a high drive, highly energized person cause you're scanning the world for what's wrong and its usually easy to find something if you're looking hard enough and that you tend to get stuck there when you have, uh, high norepinephrine and low GABA so you tend to get repetitive and now you're creating worry and the more worry you create the stronger the, the pathway in the brain is for that thought process. So you'll fall into worry more readily. I want people to know that, um, and actually I use an analogy. Um, you know when people are like laying out, um, the, uh, landscape around a building. Very often you see a beautiful lawn landscaped around a lovely building with right angle sidewalks and people start cutting across the grass to get to the front door of the building and it doesn't take very long to make a rut, okay? 

00:17:00
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:17:00
PEG WEHRENBERG Your brain does the same thing with worrying, okay? And just as when people come sort of wandering down that sidewalk and say, oh, there's already a path, they cut down the path even though they might not have done that if the lawn was all pristine. So, the brain is a lot like that, you have these paths that are easy to fall into and with worrying and generalized anxiety we have to understand that's logical, that it, that you fall into worry and you have to be every specific about getting out of it and I, and I'll say to people, what do you have to do if you want to regrow the grass in that pathway that was created walking up to the building? And everybody says, well you have to block people from walking down there. Okay, that's what we have to do in the brain. You have to block yourself from going down the worry path and we do that with thought, we do that with thought stopping. Saw it, stop it! One of the simplest and most ineffective techniques that there is, cause see and stop it doesn't do you any good unless you have another place to go so that's why we need to have thought replacements planned ahead of time so that we have another place to walk immediately. And that's what I want people to do is create different pathways in their brain by doing thought stopping with immediate thought replacing and we plan that ahead of time so they know what they're gonna think about instead of their worry and the faster you stop yourself from walking down the worry path the faster you erase all the trace of that worry thought and that's what we're after. Erase the trace, create new thoughts that are not obsessive by wandering off in another direction. So that, that high norepinephrine person is gonna tend to be a worrier and I want them to use the energy of that high drive to be very persistent in going down a different pathway in their brain. 

00:19:00
RICH SIMON So give us a, a concrete example of that. So, in, and might this happen so I'm a, I'm the generalized, the person with that generalized anxiety. I'm coming in, I'm a worrier. You, uh, you do some initial assessment with me. You get a sense of how I operate and how this, the world that this worry plays in my life. Kinds of things I worry about. Um, what, what's gonna go on? You tell me a little a little bit about the brain and the, and the way, uh, GABA, about norepinephrine, uh, some of these, this information that we're describing. What is it that, what in addition to that, what are you, what would you like to, what's your goal to, for a first session with me as a worrier. Uh, and, how, what might, and what gets accomplished in that, in that first session. Might we get to what you're talking about now within a very first session of psychotherapy. 

00:19:55
PEG WEHRENBERG Um, I will tell you that in the, the first session, if we could, if we could eliminate the initial interview. You know, where I'm getting your history and making sure you had a doctor's appointment and, you know, where did you grow up and where do you work and what, tell me your problem. Okay, we gotta do all of that and in a first session I may actually say to somebody a little bit about the brain issue of worrying and what I might ask them to do is then observe between today and our next session, what it, bring me back some of your typical worriers. Watch yourself talk. Um, notice how much time you spend a day worrying as opposed, and, and are there specific times of day that are worse for you. I have some people whose managed pretty well when they're at work because they're very preoccupied with wok projects and as the night goes on they get more and more worried til they could just jump out of their skin with the worries of the day and then they can't turn their brain off to go to sleep. But some people wake up in the morning worried like crazy and it gets better during the day. I don't know why. That's one thing I've never figured out but I do know that people will have better or worse times, and I also ask them to watch for triggers. Are there any circumstances that spike their worrying. Um, and you may see, for example, people say, I'm pretty good at work but as I get closer to going home my anxiety starts to mount and then I ask them, why? And to look at it and it will usually be, I start to be afraid that I don't have enough work done and then I start to worry that I'm gonna lose my job and then I'm thinking I have to leave on time to pick up the kids and if I'm late one more time, they're gonna fine me at the day care center but everybody else is staying late today but I can't and now I start to worry. What if I lose my job? What if I pay fines at the day care? And I'm off and running and I'm set up to be just worried for the rest of the night. 

00:21:55
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. Okay. 

00:22:00
PEG WEHRENBERG And, so that, I'll ask them to pay attention, bring me back that data, in other words and then we'll talk about how they could, at that specific point where they start to head off to the races, how we could stop that. Um, what could, what would be an effective thought replacement. Thought stopping isn't 100% what we do. I'm also very concerned about lifestyle. And, generically with every patient I look at nutrition, exercise and sleep. Every single one. Um, you don't change all that in one session. I mean, I could say, hey Rich, you should just sleep more, exercise more and eat better and you'd say, yeah okay. That, that'd be therapy. We're done now. The fact that people don't do that is an issue but it, that's more slow. We get at that over a period of time unless somebody tells me they're drinking two pots of coffee a day. Then we might have an immediate intervention on caffeine but, by in large, I want them to bring me data and then by the second session I'm talking about managing their thoughts and we'll practice it, we'll develop alternative thoughts. Um, I'll explain a little bit more thoroughly why they need to do it and practice it. And then, the fine tuning part of therapy is having them come back and look at why they didn't do it. Look at how, look at what got in the way. Look at why one worry was too hard to get rid of. Um, uh, recently I dealt with a client, this is, and I dealt with this same person, if you will, same person, the same anxiety in many different people which is healthy anxiety. Um, what if I have an STD? What if nobody can detect it? Well, what do you mean, what if you have a disease nobody can detect? Well, what if I really do have it but the doctor isn't sure? What if the doctor misses it? And, and, the, the thing with anxiety is you could go to the doctor and the doctor could say to you, Rich you don't have that disease, okay? And you could, if you had generalized anxiety go home and say, yeah but I didn't tell the doctor about this one time six weeks ago when I, you know, and then they're off to the races again. And I need to in therapy, wait for those things to emerge and then we deal with them as obstacles to thought management. 

00:24:20
RICH SIMON So let's, lets, lets, uh, stay with where we are right now so this is relative early. So you're doing, you, you, you, more of the, more of the person's pattern emerges and the idiosyncrasies of their worries and what, what the particular aspects of their style of worrying that gives them difficulties. But, when we move, to move from that stage of thought stopping which in and of itself, is an effect of the thought replacement. So, give us some examples of, of, how, uh, you would work with someone in the early stages of thought replacement and give us the flavor of how that might progress through the therapy. 

00:24:55
PEG WEHRENBERG What I really wanna do is see if this client is capable of generating a couple of positive thoughts every day. Um, and I will ask them right in the therapy session, if you were gonna think about something today that was just fun for you, think about what would it be and early in therapy people will say, what do you mean? I only have negative thoughts. I said, yeah but if you're going to have a positive thought, what might it be? Well, my positive thought might be that this isn't the worst day that I've ever had. You're looking at their pull towards negativity initially and that I will coach them a little bit. I'll say, well what do you like to think about? What do you like to do? What, what in your life might be pleasant for you and, I don't know, for you it might be thinking about a basketball game you're gonna play and a recent good time you had on the court or you might think about going dancing and where, where, where, which, which place you want to go to this weekend and review the various positives at different places to do what you like to do. I'll ask people to think about a movie they saw recently that made them feel good. Or, um, what they're gonna eat for dinner. Or, um, what bike trail they wanna ride their bike on this weekend. Or what book they're gonna read. Whatever their interests are. I have one gal, uh, who came up with the idea that her thought replacement each week during the summer would be to replay her weekend golf game in her mind. So whenever she, she's one of those rare people who plays golf who really loves it. Um, she would, she would say, okay, I don't wanna worry. I'm gonna think about the tee off on the third whole and boy was that a beautiful shot and I'm gonna see it in my mind. And so she's just gonna go to the golf course for a minute and then everything else will just sort of, her mind will wander away down a different path. But its sot of depends for each client what that might be. Some of my clients object to the idea that they should have a positive thought when they're in the their workplace which is interesting cause they're not worried about having negative thoughts. They can sit at their desks and worry all day but the minute I suggest that they daydream for a minute, well, but I'm at work, I'm not supposed to do that. Alright, then lets redirect your attention to your work and so I'll talk with them about their job and what, how they could just pull back from worrying to working. Um, and that's tricky if work is a generator of anxiety. Likewise, it may be tricky if you're worried about your kids to think about family life so this is a lot about tweaking. You know, what each individual's process is and when we're talking about that stuff you get there, their resistance. Um, one of my clients, uh, was at, not unusual at all for anxiety, uh, who said, uh, very clearly, but if I stop worrying then what in the world would I do with my time. I'm, uh, you know, and then, and then another, younger gal, uh, this high school senior said to me, well if I stop worrying then I'll forget all the important things I have to do. So basically she was saying, I need to worry. That is the way that I make sure I've covered all the bases. Then we have to move into some other management than thought stopping. I have to work on teaching people to make lists that are effective, that work in their life. That kind of thing. So, it's really managing every place your mind goes during the day and really taking control of it again. 

00:28:30
RICH SIMON So the thought, the, the, the replacement thoughts. So if, if, if my worries is about my health and I'm, um, I, I'm, I'm, a, a Woody Allen character and I'm always about to come down with some incurable illness and I can imagine it and it's really vivid and all the reasons that you explain, even if I go to the doctor I don't really believe that they, they, they caught it and I'm coming to see you and I get, when life isn't demanding I do something else. I ruminate about that. So, is the, is the thought, the replacement thought, does it, eh, from what you're saying, it doesn't need to have a necessary relationship to my health. It could just be a positive experience of any kind? 

00:29:20
PEG WEHRENBERG Yeah. In fact its better if it's not related to your health. Um, uh, what I might do is have you interject one statement which is, stop, I've handled that and then go somewhere else but I don't want you to review every way you've already managed to handle your health and all the conversations you've had with your doctor and, and that 50 pages of information of information you've downloaded from the internet. I don't want you to review that. I just want you to say, I handled that and then do a thought replacement of something completely different. 

00:29:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:29:50
PEG WEHRENBERG Okay? 

00:29:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:29:55
PEG WEHRENBERG Stayin' away from your health as much as we can. 

00:29:55
RICH SIMON Okay. And so, and then, and so becomes, is it a kind of, in your, your helping me to develop that habit so if it's the golf game or if its, its uh, looking forward to a basketball game that I might, or uh, uh, some other kind of fun activity. How do you elaborate on it? So that's the, that's the general direction. Where do the, the new thought replacement might go and then how do you help me to develop a new practice that has something like the, the, the power and the elaboration that the old worrying pattern has that it can truly replace it? 

00:30:40
PEG WEHRENBERG Well the thing that, that I want to really aim for is that you have control of your thinking at every moment and if you decide to daydream about something and many of us spend time in daydreaming that I would prefer for you to be imagining pleasant scenarios and positive outcomes and seeing yourself succeeding, which you can do deliberately. Um, the biggest goal for somebody who's a worrier is to not do repetitive thinking. I want them to get into the habit of having a mind that wanders. Um, and if you're sitting at a workplace, if you have a kind of a job, um, like, uh, where you have to produce a work product like writing charts at your therapy office or, um, doing the accounting at the accounting firm. I want you really to just say, oh stop and then bring your attention to your work. Because your work should go in a flow and occupy your mind. Um, I want you to be as non-obsessive as possible. So I don't really want you to replace it with obsession. I want you to get into a habit of having a mind that can wander. 

00:31:55
RICH SIMON So how does that happen? So, it, so, so that's your goal and I'm a, I'm a, a worrier. I have a lot of practice worrying about my health. So, kind of play out a scenario for us about, or if there's a certain client that, uh, comes to mind. How do the stages of this kind of change process when it works. How, what does it look like and what's your role in that process? 

00:32:20
PEG WEHRENBERG The first and biggest stage is developing the willingness to stop, to erase, and then to understand the principle of erase the trace, okay. And that may take a while because people will... 

00:32:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Erase the trace, meaning? 

00:32:35
PEG WEHRENBERG Of worrying. I want you just to erase all those neurobiological pathways of worrying, okay. I want you to stop the worrying about your heart attack. Stop the worrying about your acid reflux. Stop the worrying about STDs. Whatever, your brain tumor of course. Every time you have a headache it's a brain tumor. 

00:32:50
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm hmm. Yep. Yep. 

00:32:50
PEG WEHRENBERG Not you specifically Rich, of course. 

00:32:55
RICH SIMON Your reading my thoughts. You have great clinical intuition Peg as we've established in our previous relationship. I know this, okay. 

00:33:00
PEG WEHRENBERG So, so, I'd, I know, so, I will say, first of all, pragmatically, if you actually have a symptom, we're gonna get a medical checkup for, you know, I'm gonna insist that you have a clear medical checkup. And that's when you find out, well the doctor already told me there was nothing wrong or I've already had 12 months of heart monitor tests or something. But if you haven't had it checked out, you must. Um, this often happens for people. It's a very common one. That's somebody's afraid that they have a STD but they won't go to the doctor. You know, we're not talking about that STD until you go and find out. Because if you do, you gotta get it treated. Therapy won't fix it. Um, if you, and because those symptoms are often quite vague for people. Hard to describe, embarrassing to describe, um, I want them to get a medical checkup so that, then I can with certainty tell them, stop thinking about it. Um, I can't as a therapist tell you to stop worrying about your heart if you tell me you haven't had it checked out, okay. But that's, so that's the first thing but the next thing is you start to understand when they say, well I can't stop worrying because. Now you find out a little bit about their life history. About who in their family was sick. How did their parents handle illness. Um, all those kind of relative things that give me a little bit of insight as to how hard it's gonna be to stop this because life history is not separate from neurobiology. We know this through the wonderful researches that taught us so much about neurobiology, that mind body is one, you know, the, Dan Siegel's wonderful statement that the mind is, uh, really the, or the psyche is the flow of information and energy. You know, so everything's dynamic, everything is interrelated but what I want to find out from my clients is mostly, what will their re- resistance to giving up worry be. Because too many people worries is a magical function. So, for example, I have one client who says, well I know that as long as I'm worried about having an STD that I won't sleep with that guy this weekend. So she's using worry to sort of put an impulse control monitor on herself. And so she's got... 

00:35:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. Or the idea of secondary gain. The older psychodynamic idea. Yeah. 

00:35:25
PEG WEHRENBERG Yes. Absolutely. Yeah. So I need to look for whatever I, I call this magical worry, is that my worry has a magical function of protecting me in some way or another. So if I'm, if I'm dealing with that I'm afraid I'm sort of wandering off the pathway because I've let my mind learn to wander so well. What I, if I've got a client, let's say, who's got this big worry about, I'll, I'll use the STD example, and I know for sure because they've had a checkup because they aren't uh, uh, infected with anything. Then I'm gonna say, ok, we're done. There is no more discussion. no more internet research. Um, you, you know. And I will talk with them about how not to get on the internet but we aren't gonna discuss it in therapy anymore. We're gonna discuss anxiety management in therapy. So when they come in and say, I'm just really, really worried about the STD I'll say, stop. Tell me how you're managing anxiety. Tell me about what you would rather think about and we'll try to go from there. And I will teach them to interrupt their thought process. Um, that often takes several sessions because people are very brilliant creators of symbols and obstacles so, um, its, I, the phrase I use with clients is this is really simple to understand but it's not easy to do. 

00:36:55
RICH SIMON Okay, so let's, uh, you're giving us the idea of the flow of the stages of the, of what you're doing in therapy in this case with a client who worries too much. So, lets for a moment go back to where we started and the role that an understanding of neurobiology plays in the process. So initially, as the client, the worrying client coming in. You're helping me to understand my condition and not seeing it as an indictment of my character, that I'm somebody who has developed this habit of worrying. You're explaining how my nervous system operates. At this point where you're trying to help to develop some new habits and some new patterns in my life. What if any is the role that neurobiology plays in the, your interventions and the work that we're undoing in my psychotherapy with you. 

00:37:50
PEG WEHRENBERG Well, if I understand correctly what you're asking for, is it about how therapy changes neurobiology? 

00:38:00
RICH SIMON Not so much that but how, um, how neurobiology, is it, it sounds like at this point, might it be that, you know, you're using the cognitive behavioral techniques that are effective in working with this problem and at a certain point the neurobiology, that perspective, maybe referred to occasionally but it doesn't really shape or inform the psychotherapy that you're doing. So what you're doing today might be similar to, perhaps, to what you were doing ten years ago 15 years ago before you integrated the neurobiology into your work. 

00:38:35
PEG WEHRENBERG Uh, yes, there's similarity but the thing that the neurobiology has really helped me with, in my understanding and has helped my clients with is the phenomenal role of persistence. 

00:38:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:38:50
PEG WEHRENBERG That, that to make this really work, u, you can't do it once in a while. It, to really make it work, you have to put your effort into persistence with the method and that's true whether you're dealing with getting rid of panic or stopping worrying or going into place where you might experience social fear. I don't want people to move faster than their fear because if they try to do something and then end up being scared it's gonna make it worse. Uh, an example, I was working with a man who was afraid of having panic attacks in business meetings and he said, I'm just gonna make myself do it and so he would go into the very meeting that was the most alarming meeting to him and he'd have a panic attack and he'd come out and he'd say, see, I didn't have a panic attack. And I would say, well, yeah but I wanted you to like, learn how to stop panicking before you went to the scariest meeting you could think of. Um, because now what you brain has learned is, yes indeed that's scary. Here's where the amygdala comes back into it, by the way. Is that every brain structure has two side and the right side of the amygdala is the side that's learning fear but the left side of the amygdala is the part of the amygdala is going, okay, this is a situation similar to where, that have been scary, but is this one really scary? Is it really actually safe? And if the amygdala on the left side can go, oh, it really is safe, it can talk back to the right side of the amygdala so you don't act in the future with fear. I have to put, I tell people I want you to be there without the scare. I want you to go to the place where you're afraid of panicking and be able to be there without panic. I want you to, to, to go to that staff meeting and give your presentation about your client without your heart pounding so that your brain can go, oh this isn't scary. I could do this again. But if you're not prepared then you're going to overwhelm your brain and the left side of your amygdala is going to go, yes, it must be scary cause my heart is pounding and I can't breathe. So, it, this must be scary too. So, overstepping your preparedness is a challenge in therapy. That's where my understanding of brain chemistry has really helped me slow down, take small steps, um, and, and I will tell you that there are some times when plunging in and living through it is a good idea and we would call that flooding. But for a lot of people we wanna work with the idea of mastering one small step at a time. And that, that's really brain based and I explain to them why they can't overwhelm themselves with fear and they have to be able to move in predictable graded steps towards accomplishing their goal. That wouldn't be the case with thought stopping by the way, where I just want you to stop the thought. This is more for going into situations where you're a little afraid and another brain chemistry piece that matters that I talk to people about is related to stopping panic because a panic attack is about you nervous system suddenly perceiving that there's danger. Even if there isn't. For no good reason you're suddenly panicking. Learning diaphragmatic breathing uh, is so effective because that's the one thing that stops panic but you have to do it. You have to know how to do it then you actually have to do it when you're panicking if you want to stop the panic or slow it down. And so, if I have someone suffering panic we're gonna start breathing in the first or second session and we're gonna, and I teach them that breathing, slow diaphragmatic breathing actually is a biological change. It causes parasympathetic calming to begin. So that's just a biology change. And, and I want them to know they can create that on purpose. So, I just spilled out a lot of different aspects of how I use the brain. 

00:43:00
RICH SIMON So let, let's, let me, so let's go back for a moment and see if I get it. So, uh, this, the role of what you're saying is a very important theme here, is there, there, there aren't shortcuts for most anxiety problems and that persistence is a huge factor and its creation of new habits and alternative habits to the, uh, to the self defeating habits, the selfish habits. So, in terms of how you communicate that and the role, you're saying that your understanding of neurobiology helps you to recognize the importance of that. As the client, what, how, what are the kinds of things you tell your clients and might tell me about persistence and the importance that it's gonna, persistence has and steadiness and, and, and uh, and putting one foot in front of the other is gonna play in my work with you. 

00:44:00
PEG WEHRENBERG Well, first of all, I'm gonna explain that, uh, I'll use that metaphor of the pathway and then a few just new little tiny green chutes of grass growing up in that pathway and then you just go tromping down it. You're back to square one. So, okay, I want you to really give it a chance for some really good strategy. 

00:44:20
RICH SIMON That's, that's a metaphor that you, you, you, you use a lot with... 

00:44:25
PEG WEHRENBERG Yes, I, for worrying in particular. 

00:44:25
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:44:25
PEG WEHRENBERG Um, with panic its more the, the, um, idea of understanding that you're brain gets sensitive and the more often you have a panic attack the more likely it is that you will trigger a panic attack because your brain gets um, sensitized and easily flips into panic at the least little encouragement if you've had a lot of panic attacks. So, developing the ability to slow panic down, to decrease the intensity or duration and even to, to avert panic altogether which you can do with breathing. You can actually avert panic from beginning. Um, breathing and banishing your thoughts. Um, I will tell them that that gives you chance, your brain a chance to get less sensitive. It's like if you have, um, any kind of abrasion on your skin and you keep scratching at it or rubbing it, you keep it inflamed. You need to leave it alone. You need to put a band aid on it so you don't keep scratching it or rubbing it or bumping it so you have a chance for healing so it's not so sensitive. And then the least, and then the less abraded it is the less you're going to be inclined to pay attention to it and pretty soon its healed. And that, in, is, is a reasonable way of thinking about panicking. The less you panic, the less you will panic. And, um, to that extent stopping panic persistently is really important. There's also the underlying thing and this is, um, less about brain chemistry than the way people work, um, is the power of belief. Um, I just read this really interesting book by Charles Duhigg about the power of habit and he looks at the fact, what helps people change habits is believing that what they are doing is gonna work. And, and he talked about it in several different ways but, but what occurs to me is that if you can convince somebody that if you do this your brain will change and they believe therefore, boy I better do this, they're gonna be more persistent, okay? So this is a way of getting cognitive buy in, a belief system going. 

00:46:40
RICH SIMON Okay, that makes sense. 

00:46:40
PEG WEHRENBERG Okay. Um, and, and so depending on my clients' interest in this I may spend two minutes on the metaphor or we may explain the sympathetic nervous system quite extensively depending on their interest. I mean I don't talk to everybody for an hour about biology. I may talk to them about it for two minutes. Just enough to get their cognitive buy in. 

00:47:05
RICH SIMON So, a moment ago you, you started talking, we had, we had been talking mostly about worrying and rumination and thought stopping and developing alternative thoughts and then we, uh, for, uh, we, we began to talk a bit about panic. So, it sounds, it, it, in your work with panic it sounds like there's sort of a fundamental, uh, panic set of, panic prevention skills that early on you want to develop with your client. Uh, particularly, the, diaph- diaphr diagraph- diaphragmatic breathing, you'll help me with my my panic at not being able to pronounce that term. Uh, so talk to us about that. So, how, help me with, what kind of, is that early in the stage if its identified that I just, I start, uh, I'm freaking out of my business meetings. I've begun to have these panic attacks. What are is, its, do you begin to zoom in on some certain basic skills about breathing and about, uh, thought management that, that, you'll, you'll, you'll try to make sure that I, that I, that I have as, as uh, you've installed in me. 

00:48:15
PEG WEHRENBERG Yeah and its actually, it's pretty simple, um, again to, to, and there's, there's three things that we need to do: one, diaphragmatic breathing... 

00:48:25
RICH SIMON Thank you. 

00:48:30
PEG WEHRENBERG Um, yes. Um, that's skill number one. Skill number two is stop catastrophizing. Panic isn't lethal. Its unpleasant but it isn't gonna kill you and I want you to change your catastrophic thinking about that. I'm gonna look also at the way that you catastrophize panic. Do you think you're gonna die? Go crazy? Or lose control? Those are sort of the three categories that people are afraid of. I'm gonna lose control if I panic and so I'm gonna, I wanna know specifically what your image is and then we're gonna basically debunk that. I'm gonna decatastrophize your catastrophic thinking. 

00:49:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:49:05
PEG WEHRENBERG Um, if you have some trauma connected to that we're gonna pause and try to work with, um, you may say, uh, I, I had a guy who thought having panic meant he was going crazy and, as many people do, and when I started talking to him about it he had a very clear image. He had an uncle with paranoid schizophrenia and he thought that when he panicked that that meant he was becoming his uncle. So we had to really deal with all that that uncle had lived in his house and had been a source of great humiliation and embarrassment in my client's youth. So there was all kinds of stuff about his fear that he too was crazy. We could take care of that, okay, but that was a, played a role in not getting overly concerned about panic and then we have to have a what, what do you do if you panic plan. Because sometimes you're gonna panic, I mean, I'm, I, I wish I was a miracle worker and I could wave my magic wand and you'd be find. In which case I could probly charge you $10,000 a session cause I'd only need one session and, you know, you'd be all better and that would be worth it to you I guess. But nobody's, I'm not that perfect and neither are any of my clients. So what I want to do with them is then say, look. Sometimes the worst is gonna happen. Sometimes you are gonna panic. So let's talk about in each setting where you're afraid of panic exactly how you're gonna handle it and we write it down, and we make a plan and we talk about if you're driving in your car where you're gonna pull over. You know, how are you gonna get ready to start driving again. If you're in that meeting and you just feel like you have to run out of there, how can you exit without making a scene. How can you get control of yourself. Are you gonna go back in. We make a whole plan for what's gonna happen and that way you know if the worst happens I have my plan and you've got it written down and it's in your shirt pocket or it's in your pants pockets or its in your purse or your glove compartment of your car, um, so you know it's right there and hopefully you won't need it but if you do, worse things have happened than having a panic attack. You'll survive it and here's your plan, here's your catastrophe plan. Those are the three... 

00:51:25
RICH SIMON I feel reassured just hearing the tone of your voice Peg, Okay. 

00:51:30
PEG WEHRENBERG So those are the three things: calm yourself with breathing, stop your catastrophic thinking and have a plan for if, if the bad thing happens and you panic, what are you gonna do. 

00:51:40
RICH SIMON Okay. So, so move us to us, you're developing that early and an early stage in your work with somebody and so I'm trying to implement that plan. I, with varying degrees of success I would imagine, um, uh, across different kinds of clients. What, so, what is it, what is it that you find yourself having to deal with? What emerges as you move into the later stages of your work with somebody who's, who's cooperative, they're getting with the program, they're, they're accepting the credibility, they buy into your brain explanations and that, they, that makes them feel more hopeful and more motivated. What is the overall shape of the psychotherapy looks like with uh, such a person? 

00:52:30
PEG WEHRENBERG For most people there will be some personality style or life history issues that need resolution. Um, and they don't realize are actually connected to the way that they express their anxiety. And I'll tell them, you have a brain setup for anxiety but you have an individual, unique life and some things about your life drive your anxiety. For example, um, uh, a person who's been raised to, let's say, this is not at all uncommon, has had a sick grandmother, grandfather or a sick parent and they have learned that if they go away from home that their family member could have a health crisis and its safer if they stay home and watch to make sure that that other person's safe. In, later in life they might not realize that that same dynamic is operating if they leave their child with the babysitter and have a terrible panic attack because they've walked away from the house. Or, you know, they may need to make that connection about safety, uh.... 

00:53:45
RICH SIMON Implicit memories that they have that they have, they're not, they're not really aware that there's a.... 

00:53:50
PEG WEHRENBERG Yeah. And they're not aware that there's a connection to the present day anxiety. So, as we do in therapy, sometimes it's enough to raise awareness, so they see the connection. Sometimes you have to do trauma desensitization. I do a lot of the MDR and, um, a lot of, um, energy tapping like emotional freedom technique. I use that a lot. Um, ways that help people calm down. I'd, I also understand that um, for some people it's easier to be anxious than it is to be angry. Or to be full of grief. Um, and so, they may, as they start to get rid of anxiety, now start to notice other emotions. And then we have, we have to learn to, why, why are you so angry? What's, what's, why is it so hard to be angry? That's a very good question for a lot of clients with anxiety. Um, so those are some typical things I would look at. Some connection from an early life experience that shapes their anxiety that they aren't connecting and just bringing it to awareness makes a huge difference. And, um, and, and, and I'm talking now about situations where the life is not, like a life history of physical abuse or sexual abuse which is obviously a lot more complicated. Um, so we're always looking at how anxiety symptoms are expression of an individual life. 

00:55:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:55:20
PEG WEHRENBERG And if people begin to feel confident that they can control their worrying, even if their worrying spikes up a little bit because we're talking about sensitive life issues, they'll, I'll remind them of what we need to do and they'll sort of go, oh yeah, yeah, I know how to stop that so they feel a little safer exploring. That's been my experience at any rate. 

00:55:45
RICH SIMON We've, we've, uh, let's, we, we have, uh, about five minutes to go and we've, we've uh, early on we began to talk about social anxiety disorder. Uh, and there's a lot of overlap and, amongst these, but is there, are there some distinctive methods, just, distinctive issues in working with people who have social anxiety disorder that, uh, you'd like to point out for us. 

00:56:15
PEG WEHRENBERG Yes. Uh, because with social anxiety there are two brain issues that are very significant. One is that, that in social anxiety more than any other anxiety, the likelihood of being over reactive to threats of humiliation or embarrassment is a powerful deterrent to going and being, uh, visible socially. And the other is the socially anxious client if they have sort of a passive, quiet personality may have very low motivation to become more socially involved. To become more visible to the world by displaying their talents or abilities. Very often socially anxious children don't develop their skill set and we have a very powerful role in children with social anxiety who aren't trying out for the basketball team. They aren't trying out for the band. They don't wanna be the president of the student council. No, they do not want to stand up in front of class and give a speech. They are not developing their potential abilities so we have a, a prevention role in supporting these children in developing their potential and not being scared to do so. One of the reasons they don't is they don't ever wanna be in the limelight. 

00:57:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:57:25
PEG WEHRENBERG And because the terror of being humiliated is out of proportion in this client. So when we're dealing with anybody with social anxiety the older they are the more likely it is that we have to examine their social skill set and provide missing skills because they haven't been developing social skills. So even with an adult, you may have to talk with them about pickup lines or social chit chat or I had one guy who just never wanted to go out to lunch, or out to dinner with anybody if it meant driving in the car because he had a complete absence of social conversation skills. He had grown up in a family with two silent parents and he was the only child. So, so, there was a, a sense of, I don't know how to be comfortable conversationally. That would be an example of the kind of missing social set in somebody who otherwise looks, you know, like fine. So, missing social skills, developing the motivation, why would I wanna do that anyway? We have to really strengthen their motivation and then we have to decrease fear because they're probably over reactive to fear. So the social, socially anxious client, I always say, can't throw 'em in the deep end of the pool. You have to help him walk down the dock of, of, you know, or wade into the water a little at a time and get back out safely and wade a little deeper and get back onto the shore safely because they, they will be so overwhelmed if you try to make them do a big deal all at once. So with social anxiety, um, I call it three deep breaths in the preparation and I won't tell the long story about how it got that title. Can you calm your body down? Do you have the skills, did you learn the script? Have you had a chance to rehearse the script, practice it? And have you had some real life exposures that went well? And if you haven't had anyway that well, that went well, the therapy has to create small exposures at a time to get you into that model of practicing and succeeding over and over. 

00:59:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:59:40
PEG WEHRENBERG So that's the short version but its about helping the left side of the amygdala learn, oh, I'm really safe here. That's what we're doing. We're unlearning fear. 

00:59:50
RICH SIMON And so, finally, is, what is the research telling us about working with, across this range of anxiety issues. Is, uh, how's our track record as psychotherapists, particularly the cognitive behavioral approach, uh, that you've been describing for us and has it, has it changed? Have we gotten it any better in recent years? And is there any indication, four part question here. Um, respond to whatever part you care to, is there indication that bringing in this understanding about neurobiology makes out approaches any more effective. 

01:00:30
PEG WEHRENBERG That's actually, that last part is interesting because I'm not sure that anybody that I know of, at any rate, has researched if this conversation makes a difference. And I can tell you the least valid, uh, opinion about that is my own because it would be anecdotal, right? 

01:00:45
RICH SIMON Right. 

01:00:50
PEG WEHRENBERG But I observe that, um, when I talk to therapists, and you know I do quite a lot of that, um, when the light bulb comes on, they go, oh, I know what to do now. I know when to do it. Um, I know why I need to really push my client to take those little steps. Um, so I suspect there are people who are being more confident in their, more therapists are being more condiment in pushing anxiety management. I think... 

01:01:15
RICH SIMON Because, because of their, so you're connecting with them around the brain science and whether or not their, their clients need to hear that. You're seeing that the therapists get something from it and it helps them connect dots and perhaps their increased belief in what they're doing may, may make them effective but we, you know, we haven't measured this yet. We're not sure. 

01:01:35
PEG WEHRENBERG That hasn't been measured but what has been measured is that these therapy techniques work and, and they, and they actually are persistent, um, and, I, I read this study and I will not remember who did it because I'm not good at calling that to mind that's cognitive therapy techniques seem to last four to four and a half years and then people sort of need refreshers. But that they, that it, that it, a good course of therapy and its usually fairly brief. 12 to 20 sessions. Um, people get mastery and then after a while they kind, they feel better but then they kind of forget and anxiety creeps up and I'll tell ya, I see that in my practice where people come back for, and they'll say I feel like I need a booster shot. You know, I need to talk to you and refresh my memory cause I'm seeming to worry more than I used to. So I get a little bit of that. Um, but there's plenty of evidence that cognitive behavioral techniques work very, very well. Um, there's loads of evidence that breathing and thought management for panic can help in as few as five sessions, especially if people do homework in between. Um, and I, I think that, um, we have great reason, really based in, uh, demonstrative research that therapy works to change the brain. I mean you can watch it changing on brain scans so I think there's great reassurance to people that if you do this it will work and we can support that with research about, and, and, that's probably all I need to say about that. 

01:03:15
RICH SIMON And this probably, the, the domain of therapeutic practice where there is the most research with anxiety symptoms are often clearly defined. Methodology for addressing those symptoms is clearly defined. This is one area where there is a match between what clients are bringing to us and the tools we have and, uh, research our methods. 

01:03:40
PEG WEHRENBERG Yes. So where we're gonna see some interesting research as it begins to emerge more and more is that people who are doing, um, cognitive interventions for anxiety or depression by telephone and by virtual reality therapy and by internet therapy are keeping good logs about people's response and so we're starting to get a little bit more data about what did you actually cover cause we're looking at what did the manual look like. Cause for many people like me who are doing individual therapy, we're not really working out of a manual. 

01:04:10
RICH SIMON Sure. 

01:04:10
PEG WEHRENBERG Okay. but when we are doing these phone, virtual reality and internet programs, most of 'em are operationalized. Set ones. And I think we'll get some good research and then, and there's beginning to be some about virtual reality therapy that's very convincing. 

01:04:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. So there's these protocols they, you know, that lots of therapists are in private practice and who're dealing with more ambiguous issues can, um, uh, are, uh, can, can be skeptical about protocols and protocolized approaches to psychological issues. Within some, with some certain kinds of symptoms in anxiety would seem to be a prime example. This may be an arena where its, where it's helpful. Large groups of people can benefit from these more protocolized treatments. 

01:05:00
PEG WEHRENBERG I believe that's real, that's true and I'm, it's certainly is a goal that I personally have to make sure that people have a lot of access to anxiety management and depression management because, um, there is no more startling statistic then to see that probly 1 in 25 people in the course of their lifetime will suffer from anxiety or mood disorder. So we need, we need to know what to offer people. 

01:05:25
RICH SIMON Okay. So as uh, as we come to a close here people who have been intrigued and found, uh, interesting stuff and, and, uh, wanna follow up with you about, uh, and, and find out more about what you do, resources that you may offer through your website. Other ways to develop skills in this approach in working with anxiety, where do they go? 

01:05:50
PEG WEHRENBERG Well, my website is my name: MargaretWehrenberg.com. Um, and WW Norton is the publisher of my four books. Three of them on anxiety, one on depression. Um, which means, of course, Amazon has them as well. 

01:06:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:06:10
PEG WEHRENBERG And I just published a workbook for anxiety management that actually therapy clients can work their way through. It's really aimed at the general public. Comes with a CD of relaxation techniques included in the book itself. So, that's something I'm excited about and, um, of course, where I'm gonna be speaking, it's on my internet, I have a speaker schedule there, so. Um...
