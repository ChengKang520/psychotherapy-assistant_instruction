Overview of the Counseling Intake Process with Dr. Brent Beam 

00:00:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Hi, I’m Brent Beam and I’m a psychologist at University Counseling Center. I’m happy to have this opportunity to share with you a broad overview of the counseling intake process. The aim of this video is to provide a user friendly template for counselors across disciplines and settings as they conduct intake interviews with the clients they serve. Whether you’re a counselor in training or season professional, this video should prove useful for your work. The video begins with this brief lecture, which will cover some of the most important considerations regarding the counseling intake process. Following this, there are two counseling skill demonstrations that give different examples of how intakes might be conducted. At the end of the demonstrations, there will be a brief commentary and summary of final points. So to begun, lets briefly discuss the counseling intake process. As the first point, it should be noted that there are many different settings for an intake interview. University Counseling Centers, community agencies, hospitals, and schools may each have their own specific intake process. Some will follow an insurance driven model while others will follow psychology, social work or medical driven model. Despite these differences, however, a number of overwriting goals of the intake are consistent cross settings. These include: 

00:01:55
• Establishing rapport • Orienting the client to the therapeutic process • Gathering information about current concerns • Assessing the client’s personal and interpersonal history • Clarifying the client’s goals and expectations • Formulating an initial assessment of the client and their presenting concerns 

00:02:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Establishing rapport, orienting the client to the therapeutic process, gathering information about current concerns, assessing the client’s personal and interpersonal history, clarifying the client’s goals and expectations and formulating an initial assessment of the client and their presenting concerns. Together these elements of the Intake Process equip the counselor to provide clinical recommendations into engage the client in treatment. The differences that do exist in intake procedures at cross settings may be due to agency and client factors. For example, in a setting that operates under a brief therapy model, the session limits might determine a counselor’s approach therapy that is long term individual treatment might not be feasible and solution focused cognitive behavioral or short-term psychodynamic therapy may become treatments of choice. Group therapy maybe a cost-effective clinically indicated treatment as well on these cases. Certain client characteristics can also dictate the focus, the pace, and the length of treatment. 

00:03:20
• Financial resources and ability to afford therapy • External restrictions on the pace of therapy: academic coursework, work schedules… • Developmental stage of the client 

00:03:20
DR. BRENT BEAM The client’s financial resources and ability to afford therapy. External restrictions on the pace of therapy such as academic coursework or work schedules and the developmental stage of the client. Consider for example, the work with adolescence maybe more likely to focus on interpersonal and relationship concerns since the user congruent with their stage of psychosocial development. Finally, in agency’s philosophy of treatment may determine the kind of information that is sought during the intake itself. Consider for example, the data gathered by a therapist in the setting that specializes in cognitive behavioral treatment for anxiety versus the data gathered by clinician in the hospital that provides counseling to cancer survivors or the families. Regardless of treatment setting, client characteristics, or treatment philosophies, thoughtful consideration of multicultural factors is a hallmark of competent clinical work during the counseling intake. As you may already know contextual factors vary in salience across individuals and maybe highly relevant to therapy goals, the client therapist interaction, and treatment outcomes. As counselors, understanding our own cultural backgrounds and identifies is an essential component of providing culturally competent care and during the counseling intake, assessing the cultural identity of the client is critical. Conducting this kind of enquiry is fairly straightforward and questions such as these can be helpful. 

00:05:00
• How do you identify yourself culturally? • What experiences have you had related to bias or prejudice? • In what ways is this part of your identity a strength in your life? • How is your cultural identity different from that of your parents? • How is your willingness to seek counseling influenced by your cultural identity? 

00:05:05
DR. BRENT BEAM How do you identify yourself culturally? What experiences have you had related to bias or prejudice? In what ways is this part of your identity a strength in your life? How is your cultural identity different from that of your parents? And how is your willingness to seek counseling influenced by your cultural identity? These questions can help establish an open dialogue between the counselor and the client regarding cultural identity and its relevant for the client and his or her presenting concerns. Please note that cultural identity is broad and includes racial, ethnic, religious, and spiritual, and sexual identities, just a name of you. Another area not to be underestimated for its connection to therapy outcomes is the assessment of the client’s personal strengths. Numerous studies support the efficacy of positive psychotherapy. Capitalizing on client’s strengths and enhancing their sense of meaning, pleasure, and engagement are highly correlated with positive therapy outcomes and considering that an estimated 40% of the variance in our happiness is within our individual control explicitly calling upon the client’s strengths or assist the healing and growth, they seek to experience. As with the assessment of cultural identity, strengths based questions are easy to incorporate during the counseling intake. This questions might include the following: 

00:06:45
• What are three of your best strengths? • Describe an experience that highlights you at your best. • What would you most like for other to appreciate about you? 

00:06:50
DR. BRENT BEAM What are three of your best strengths? Describe an experience that highlights you at your best. And what would you most like for other to appreciate about you? These and other questions allow the counselor to involve the client as a more active agent of change as the counseling process moves forward. One other common element in the counseling intake process is the assessment of factors that maybe predictive of the course of treatment or which had a minimum provide markers for the therapist to consider as therapy proceeds beyond the initial intake. It may be helpful to consider that these dispositional indicators generally follow the rubric of assessment covered by the DSM 5 access system including: 

00:07:45
• Clinical and learning disorders • Personality disorders • Medical conditions and physical disorders • Psychosocial and environmental factors • Global assessment of functioning 

00:07:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Clinical and learning disorders, personality disorders, medical conditions and physical disorders, psychosocial and environmental factors and a global assessment functioning. In general counselors who want to assess the following during the intake interview. 

00:08:05
• The nature of change needed or sought •Client characteristics: level of insight, tolerance for ambiguity, motivation for change… • Level of impairment including severity, chronicity, and pervasiveness • Whether impairments are reflective of mood or character traits 

00:08:05
DR. BRENT BEAM The nature of change needed or sought, client characteristics such as level of insight, tolerance for ambiguity, and motivation for change, level of impairment including severity, chronicity, and pervasiveness, whether impairments are reflective of mood or character traits. 

00:08:40
• Constraints and obstacles to treatment: time, money, transportation… • Prior history of trauma, abuse, eating concerns, depression or anxiety • Family and cultural history as well as family dynamics • Past or current suicide ideation • Past or current substance use or abuse 

00:08:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Constraints and obstacles to treatment such as time, money, and transportation, prior history of trauma, abuse, eating concerns, depression or anxiety, family and cultural history as well as family dynamics, past or current suicide ideation, past or current substance use or abuse. 

00:09:25
• Medical history • History of learning issues • Any problems noted in school and/or work performance • Prior experience in therapy and any progress made 

00:09:30
DR. BRENT BEAM Medical history, history of learning issues, any problems noted in school and/or work performance, and finally prior experience in therapy and any progress that was made. This ends the lecture portion of the video. In the following intake demonstrations you’ll have a chance to see how these multiple aspects of the intake are integrated. A brief commentary and discussion will follow each demonstration, facilitated by Dr. Craig Woodsmall a psychologist in the university counseling center. Finally I’d encourage you to make note of any questions you have, her moments that strike you as important, as this will be helpful for your own development and any peer or professional discussions you have following this video. 

00:10:30
Intake Session One: Dr.Beam’s intake with Nan 

00:10:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Welcome Nan, I’m Brent Beam, I’m a psychologist. I’m glad you’re here today. This is the first session that we’re having um… and I want you know that my goal of us meeting today is to try to understand your concerns um… try to gather some information about who you are, about may be some family background, anything that, that you feel as important to say. I’ll probably ask some questions as you’re talking just kind of clarify something’s and the whole point of this is so that by the end of our meeting today. Um… we can both try to figure out what the best courses going to be. 

00:11:05
NAN Hmm… 

00:11:10
DR. BRENT BEAM I’ll try to provide you pretty good recommendation based on your needs and your concerns. Um… but I’m hoping that, that can be something that we collaborate on. So, I’m happy to kind of follow your lead. I’ll be, I‘m glad to here in your own words what bring you in today. 

00:11:25
NAN Okay, well first of all please excuse my nervousness because I’m not used to being in counseling. 

00:11:30
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… sure. 

00:11:30
NAN Um… but the reason that I’m here is basically because of being having a little bit of difficulties dealing with a recent situation in my life. 

00:11:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:11:40
NAN I recently broke up with my boyfriend of three years and um… I’ve just been having a really difficult time dealing with that… 

00:11:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:11:45
NAN …right now. So maybe you could, I guess kinda help me figure out like where I can go from here. 

00:11:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Sure, sure, so, so the break up was pretty recent. 

00:11:55
NAN Yes. 

00:11:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Um… and it sounds like it was a fairly important relationship… 

00:12:00
NAN Hmm… hmm… 

00:12:00
DR. BRENT BEAM …three years long. 

00:12:00
NAN Yeah. 

00:12:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:12:00
NAN Yeah, we’ve been together ever since we both entered graduate school, so we’ve kinda been each other support system, so it was a really difficult decision deciding to end a relationship. 

00:12:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:12:15
NAN Yeah. 

00:12:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… I’m, I’m curious how that decision was made? 

00:12:20
NAN Well… so I’m in pediatric medicine and my boyfriend he is an attorney. 

00:12:25
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:12:25
NAN And it just become a situation of really conflicting schedules, not really being able to spend the time with each other. 

00:12:30
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:12:30
NAN So for a long time, we’ve just been like I guess passing ships in the night. 

00:12:35
DR. BRENT BEAM I see… 

00:12:35
NAN And I guess holding on to something that really doesn’t exist anymore. 

00:12:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:12:40
NAN So I figured instead of continuing to just… I guess being this bad situation that one of us needed to make a change. 

00:12:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:12:50
NAN And obviously he wasn’t going to be the one to do it, so I decided to be the one. 

00:12:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Oh! So, so you, you initiated this because… 

00:12:55
NAN Yeah… 

00:12:55
DR. BRENT BEAM …it sounds like it was hard to, to connect in the ways that would be important for both of you. 

00:13:00
NAN Definitely. 

00:13:00
DR. BRENT BEAM And as a pediatric resident… 

00:13:00
NAN Hmm… hmm… 

00:13:05
DR. BRENT BEAM …and as an attorney, clearly you too both have very busy schedules. 

00:13:05
NAN Yes. 

00:13:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Um… ah… I’d be interested to hear what about that has been difficult for you, you know if there is any particular aspect over it’s been hard. 

00:13:15
NAN Okay, well he is sort of been like my best friend. 

00:13:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:13:20
NAN You know we used to talk to each other every day, spend a lot of time together, when we had the time to spend together… 

00:13:25
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… hmm… 

00:13:25
NAN …and because he is also from a different country, we kind a had that connection, in terms of… 

00:13:30
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:13:30
NAN …dealing what being say a foreign person in the U.S. 

00:13:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… I see. 

00:13:35
NAN So that’s… I guess one… that’s one of the hardest thing to deal with you know… 

00:13:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:13:40
NAN …losing that connection. 

00:13:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Both, both in terms of him being your best friend… 

00:13:45
NAN Yes. 

00:13:45
DR. BRENT BEAM …and that you both have an identity of not being um… native born Americans. 

00:13:50
NAN Yes definitely. 

00:13:50
DR. BRENT BEAM So there is a lot of support and understanding with that. 

00:13:50
NAN Yeah, that’s the hardest thing to deal with. 

00:13:55
NAN I see… 

00:13:55
NAN Hmm… hmm… 

00:13:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Oh yeah… I kinda get the impression that he is one of only a few people that you might know locally who have that experience? 

00:14:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Oh yeah… because being in the U.S. has been ah… what has, it has been a difficult experience for me kinda trying to fit in and not really… 

00:14:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:14:15
NAN …fitting in with, I guess majority culture. 

00:14:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:14:15
NAN Because um… it has just been really, really hard. You know especially being in a place where, even though I am in the minority, I am still a minority, within a minority. 

00:14:30
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… can you say more about that? Tell me everything. 

00:14:35
NAN Okay so obviously I’m person of color. 

00:14:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:14:35
NAN So that makes me, I guess belong to a minority group. 

00:14:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:14:40
NAN But within that minority group I’m also different because I come from a totally different country, a totally different culture. 

00:14:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:14:45
NAN So people assume that I’m automatically accepted, because I’m a minority… 

00:14:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… I see. 

00:14:50
NAN …but that hasn’t always been the case and he has been like one of the few people who truly understand that perspective that I have. 

00:15:00
DR. BRENT BEAM It seems like that um… kind of convergence of identities is really unique… 

00:15:05
NAN Yeah. 

00:15:05
DR. BRENT BEAM …as you are experiencing and not many people know what it is like from the inside. 

00:15:10
NAN Yes. 

00:15:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Um… and so now with your um… boyfriend and you not being together, it seems like that, that’s a part of your experience that’s having to be more private. 

00:15:20
NAN Yeah. 

00:15:20
DR. BRENT BEAM You, you’re not able to share that may be as much as you were when you were with him. 

00:15:25
NAN Yeah, because um… where I’m from, counseling isn’t really… let just say acceptable to a certain extent. 

00:15:30
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:15:35
NAN So… I’m not used to talking about my problems with people who are non-family members. 

00:15:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:15:45
NAN So, being able to talk to him and share all my you know deep dark personal issues and having him understand that so difficult especially now I’m in a position where I feel really isolated, because I don’t have a lot of friends, who really… 

00:15:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Sure. 

00:16:00
NAN …understand what I’m going through, and just I think I’ve been also withdrawing myself more. 

00:16:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:16:05
NAN And just not being able to sleep at night, because I’m constantly up thinking about the loss of the relationship and what this means for me now, um… if I’m gonna have to go out and I guess try and establish new friendships and just… 

00:16:20
DR. BRENT BEAM I see… 

00:16:20
NAN …going through all of that, yeah. 

00:16:20
DR. BRENT BEAM So it has a lot of, has a lot of reports from this… 

00:16:25
NAN Yes. 

00:16:30
DR. BRENT BEAM …um decision. So Nan a few minutes ago you were talking about this experience of being kind of a double minority. 

00:16:35
NAN Yes. 

00:16:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Really interested just to hear more about that and how that’s been for you? 

00:16:40
NAN Okay. 

00:16:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:16:45
NAN Well, you know, obviously, I look black, or African American but that is not the ethnic identity that I choose to describe myself by… 

00:16:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:16:55
NAN …so that’s been really difficult for a lot of people to I guess understand based upon the way that I look, so I typically have … 

00:17:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Based on your physical attributes. 

00:17:00
NAN Yeah, so I typically have to do a lot of extra explanations… 

00:17:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:17:05
NAN …you know to really make them understand why identify certainly. 

00:17:10
DR. BRENT BEAM And what, what kind of things will you explain to them? 

00:17:15
NAN Well Umm… I would of course explain that I’m not from U.S. even though I may look like, I’m African American… 

00:17:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:17:20
NAN …I’m not from U.S.. I was born in the Caribbean and I identify myself as being a West Indian person. 

00:17:25
DR. BRENT BEAM I see, okay. 

00:17:25
NAN Yes. 

00:17:25
DR. BRENT BEAM And, and that seems like it’s really important for you to do not be misunderstood. 

00:17:30
NAN Yes. 

00:17:30
DR. BRENT BEAM That, that your racial and cultural identity is really important to you. 

00:17:35
NAN Very important. 

00:17:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Ah…so much so that this recent breakup, kinda leaves, leaves the gap in that spot in your life. 

00:17:40
NAN Yeah. 

00:17:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Did your boyfriend really understood that? 

00:17:45
NAN He was still, you know like one of the only people who totally understood and accepting me for who I’m truly, not for who people assume me to be. 

00:17:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:17:55
NAN Yeah. 

00:17:55
DR. BRENT BEAM And, so accepting you for who you are… 

00:17:55
NAN Uh Huh 

00:17:55
DR. BRENT BEAM …seems like it’s really, I mean clearly important, but almost kinda of a near the centre of the target. 

00:18:00
NAN Yes. 

00:18:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Something like a big, big part of your experience right now. 

00:18:05
NAN Uh Huh 

00:18:05
DR. BRENT BEAM I’m wondering too and I don’t wanna get to far of topic if. 

00:18:10
NAN Uh Huh 

00:18:10
DR. BRENT BEAM But you, you mentioned, you know, your identity as a West Indian 

00:18:15
NAN Uh Huh 

00:18:15
DR. BRENT BEAM And how people mistake that or make assumptions, wrong assumptions about your, your identity based on your, your kinda of physical characteristics. 

00:18:20
NAN Yes. 

00:18:25
DR. BRENT BEAM Cos, I’m wondering if you’ve had any specific experiences of bias or prejudice. 

00:18:25
NAN Uh Huh 

00:18:30
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… Since you’re time here in the States, I don’t know if they’ve been recent or, or longer but if anything come up for you. 

00:18:35
NAN Okay, umm… I remember an incident where, umm… I’ll obviously you know when you’re feeling documents of any certain categories that exist how. So, you don’t want a check a box such as you know black Hispanic or Caucasian or you gonna check other. 

00:18:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Other…Uh Huh. 

00:18:50
NAN Sometimes I check other. 

00:18:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:18:55
NAN Sometimes I actually check black. 

00:18:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:18:55
NAN You know… 

00:18:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm…hmm… 

00:18:55
NAN So I’m not trying to be difficult or anything. As you know I had an experience once where I actually got into an argument with a person, because they told me that I couldn’t check black, because I wasn’t really black, because… 

00:19:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:19:10
NAN …I wasn’t born in the U.S. and I wasn’t an African American. 

00:19:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Ah… 

00:19:15
NAN So, you know… 

00:19:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:19:15
NAN That, that was confusing to me, but you know it’s things like that I have to deal it on a daily basis. 

00:19:20
DR. BRENT BEAM Even something as simple is putting a check in a box. 

00:19:20
NAN Yes. 

00:19:25
DR. BRENT BEAM It really has a lot of meaning. 

00:19:25
NAN Uh Huh… 

00:19:25
DR. BRENT BEAM In the misinterpretation of that it sounds, I don’t know if this is too much to say, but it’s sounds like at times it’s hurtful to you. 

00:19:35
NAN Yes, very hurtful. I think more so in the beginning than it is now though, because I’ve gotten used to it. 

00:19:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:19:40
NAN And especially with him, he was able to support me throughout, but now I’m all alone with no help and no support. 

00:19:45
DR. BRENT BEAM I see. 

00:19:45
NAN Yeah… 

00:19:45
DR. BRENT BEAM I see... and, and so you’re coming to counseling as way to receive more that support or to find out other places in your life where you can get that. 

00:20:00
NAN Yes, even though I’m here with some trepidation, because like I said before you know it’s not something that I’m really used too or I mean I can imagine my parents in my head saying “What are you doing”, you know why you… 

00:20:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:20:15
NAN . …talking about your, you know your personal situation with a total stranger. 

00:20:20
DR. BRENT BEAM So, so coming here is really something that’s beyond the, the kinda of scope of expectations that your family would have, umm, maybe even though it’s a cultural value, you’re not to talk about your concerns with people outside of your immediate family. 

00:20:30
NAN Yes. 

00:20:30
DR. BRENT BEAM I, because, I can appreciate maybe to some extent, the challenge involved in being here then and I’m wondering even just so far as we’ve talked for a few minutes, umm, if you’re noticing that trepidation and here and I don’t know maybe monitoring what you’re saying or not but if you’re aware of it coming up as we’re talking. 

00:20:50
NAN Uh Huh… Just not a whole lot, but some… 

00:20:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:20:55
NAN Yeah. 

00:20:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. So, this is a it’s, it’s a really significant thing that you’re going beyond kinda traditional cultural norms to come here and talk with me. 

00:21:10
NAN Yes. 

00:21:10
DR. BRENT BEAM I’m wondering if you ever had counseling before. 

00:21:10
NAN Uh Huh… 

00:21:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Proceed(ph) with that. 

00:21:15
NAN I think one time. 

00:21:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:21:15
NAN Umm…when I was an undergrad… 

00:21:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:21:15
NAN You know, it was when I just moved here and I was having, you know some difficulties adjusting, so even though it wasn’t a part of my, you know, prior to U.S. experience, I still (inaudible ) “No let me try and see what it is about”, but… 

00:21:31
DR. BRENT BEAM For one time… 

00:21:31
NAN It really didn’t work out well. I think, you know, I didn’t really have a good relationship with the counselors, so I kinda never went back. 

00:21:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Do you remember what it was that didn’t work for you? 

00:21:45
NAN Umm… I don’t know, I think maybe it was I really didn’t want to go and I… 

00:21:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:21:50
NAN …was really nervous about being there and sharing my experience and the fact that I was brand new… 

00:21:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:21:55
NAN To the, you know to the U.S. 

00:22:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Sure… 

00:22:00
NAN I think maybe that’s what it was, just a little bit of anxiety perhaps. 

00:22:05
DR. BRENT BEAM That, that makes a lot of sense to me. I, I think a lot of people if not most have some kind of anxiety about coming into counseling even if it’s not going against their cultural norms just the fact of being here and talking about important things and kinda being a little bit vulnerable with someone that you don’t know. 

00:22:20
NAN Yeah. 

00:22:20
DR. BRENT BEAM It can be pretty intimidating. 

00:22:20
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:22:25
DR. BRENT BEAM I appreciate you, you’re acknowledging that. Umm… as we work together I’d really invite you to let me know when and if that comes up for you, umm, I, I wanna be sensitive to that and umm… it seems like that’s an important part of the conversation that, that you’re wanting to have in general to talk about, because it going to connects back to how important your identity is for you. 

00:22:45
NAN Yes. 

00:22:45
DR. BRENT BEAM And that you don’t want if you're isolated in that. 

00:22:50
NAN Yeah. 

00:22:50
DR. BRENT BEAM  Nan I’d like to get back to some of the initial symptoms that you’re describing early when, when we first started talking, umm… you mentioned some difficulty sleeping. 

00:23:05
NAN Yes. 

00:23:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm…feeling kinda of isolated. 

00:23:10
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:23:10
DR. BRENT BEAM And a most pulling back, withdrawing some from other people. 

00:23:15
NAN Yeah. 

00:23:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Are there any other thing that you’re noticing that are, I don’t know you consider symptoms or at least a different and a little bit uncomfortable for you at this point, you know post break up. 

00:23:25
NAN Uh…Huh… Umm, you know my appetite hasn’t been what it’s been usually. I tend to eat much, much less than I should. 

00:23:30
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm...now, you’re eating much less. 

00:23:30
NAN Yes. 

00:23:35
DR. BRENT BEAM At this point. 

00:23:35
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:23:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Ah… 

00:23:35
NAN So that’s another thing. 

00:23:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. 

00:23:35
NAN Yeah. 

00:23:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Anything else that you’ve noticed. 

00:23:40
NAN I guess just feeling really distracted most times, not being able to concentrate when I’m at school or when I’m doing, you know my clinical work just my mind is always wandering. 

00:23:50
DR. BRENT BEAM So, its, it’s like it’s hard to focus… 

00:23:55
NAN Yes. 

00:23:55
DR. BRENT BEAM I’m believing, you’ll will be present with the task at hand. 

00:23:55
NAN Yeah. 

00:24:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Ah… and did these kind of experiences begun after the break up or some of them around prior to the break up. 

00:24:05
NAN I think some of them started maybe a few weeks before I decided to, you know initiate the break up… 

00:24:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:24:15
NAN Because, I guess maybe I was feeling just really overwhelmed with the decision that I was preparing myself to make. 

00:24:20
DR. BRENT BEAM Oh I see… 

00:24:20
NAN But, it’s just now it’s intensified since… 

00:24:25
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:24:25
NAN Umm… we broke up. Yeah 

00:24:25
DR. BRENT BEAM And remained me again how long it hasn’t been since you broke up. 

00:24:30
NAN Probably six months. 

00:24:30
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. 

00:24:30
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:24:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. So, so these symptoms had been around for quite some time. 

00:24:35
NAN Yeah. 

00:24:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. I’m curious if there is anything else going on in your life, umm… prior to those three weeks. 

00:24:45
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:24:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Where, where you know, you took a few weeks to make the decision… 

00:24:45
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:24:50
DR. BRENT BEAM …final about the relationship. Umm…but if there are any other major changes going on in your life at that time. 

00:24:55
NAN Uh…Huh…I mean the only major change I can think about is just maybe getting spending more time at the clinic. 

00:25:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:25:05
NAN With my patients. That’s the only change to my schedule I think. Just being at work more than I was previously. 

00:25:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:25:10
NAN Because that’s, that’s why I’m in terms of my, I guess my curriculum. 

00:25:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah, okay. 

00:25:15
NAN Yeah. 

00:25:20
DR. BRENT BEAM So, having to put in all time at work. 

00:25:20
NAN Yes. 

00:25:20
DR. BRENT BEAM So, so that, that got busier and the relationship kinda you’d had. 

00:25:25
NAN Yeah. 

00:25:25
DR. BRENT BEAM And ended, umm… and around that time, these symptoms cropped up and have been around, have they gotten worse or, or I guess you said they’ve gotten little… 

00:25:35
NAN Yeah, they have gotten worse. 

00:25:35
DR. BRENT BEAM …worse such a time. Can you say what it’s been like at its absolute worst. 

00:25:40
NAN Hmm… Umm… at its absolute worse would be me just taking time off when I really shouldn’t take time off and just staying at home. 

00:25:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:25:55
NAN And just watching TV all day along just doing nothing, but watch TV all day long. 

00:26:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:26:00
DR. BRENT BEAM I mean no breakfast, no lunch, no dinner just sitting on my couch… 

00:26:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm…hmm 

00:26:05
DR. BRENT BEAM …watching TV. 

00:26:05
DR. BRENT BEAM And you do that just for a day or that be many days in a row. 

00:26:10
NAN Just for a day. 

00:26:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. And then, what would happen after that day. 

00:26:15
NAN And then I’ll try to you know motivate myself, so you know you’ve to get up, you’ve to go to work, you’ve to get this done. 

00:26:20
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:26:20
NAN You can’t sit around here all day along. 

00:26:20
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:26:20
NAN So, you know that usually works, but it’s short term. So, what I’d do it. 

00:26:25
DR. BRENT BEAM I see. 

00:26:25
NAN And then, you know go back to work for a few weeks and then back again on the couch all day long. 

00:26:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. 

00:26:35
NAN Yeah. 

00:26:35
DR. BRENT BEAM And that’s been kind of a cycle for you in the last six months. 

00:26:35
NAN Yes. Uh…Huh… 

00:26:40
DR. BRENT BEAM And you not mentioning this, but, I, I guess, I, I, I’m aware that when people have difficult circumstances like this in my experience some of these symptoms, so uncommon for them to think about, you know have thoughts of death or thoughts of their own suicide, just wanted to check out and see if that’s been something you’ve experienced in the last six months at all. 

00:27:00
NAN Ah… Well, yes. I was trying my best not to, I guess bringing it up. 

00:27:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:27:00
NAN But yes, I’ve had thoughts of umm… harming myself. 

00:27:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:27:05
NAN Umm… I didn’t have, I had, hadn’t really figured out all the details. 

00:27:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. 

00:27:15
NAN But the thought did cross my mind. 

00:27:15
DR. BRENT BEAM And, and so this is something that’s a little bit touchy to talk about. 

00:27:20
NAN Oh…Yeah. 

00:27:20
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:27:20
NAN Because, it’s just so, it’s far end to I guess in terms of who I’m like my personality… 

00:27:25
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:27:25
NAN Yeah. 

00:27:25
DR. BRENT BEAM Something you, you’re not used to experiencing. 

00:27:30
NAN No. 

00:27:30
DR. BRENT BEAM And have you felt this way before? 

00:27:30
NAN No. This is the first time I’ve ever, you know had those kind of thoughts. 

00:27:35
DR. BRENT BEAM I see, I see… 

00:27:35
NAN Yeah. 

00:27:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. And, and to make sure I understand that when the thoughts do come up… 

00:27:40
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:27:40
DR. BRENT BEAM umm… did you put words to that, just let me know and describe the thoughts are, what do you think about it at that time. 

00:27:50
NAN Umm…usually I guess when I’m in the college, I think about hmm… what is the point in even doing all this… 

00:27:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:27:55
NAN You know, it will be so easy to just I guess end it and be done with all the stress, be done with all of the assumptions people make, you know just not have to deal with anything anymore. 

00:28:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:28:10
NAN Yeah… 

00:28:10
DR. BRENT BEAM That, that it’s sounds as if it’s, it’s so painful sometimes… 

00:28:15
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:28:15
DR. BRENT BEAM That the, the thing that would feel best is for just to all end. 

00:28:20
NAN Yeah. 

00:28:20
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. If, if I hear you right, it seems like you haven’t gotten to the place of having a specific plan for enacting that. 

00:28:30
NAN No. 

00:28:30
DR. BRENT BEAM And that you haven’t attempted… 

00:28:30
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:28:30
DR. BRENT BEAM …to, to harm yourself in the past. 

00:28:35
NAN Uh…Huh…No. 

00:28:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. In the past few weeks, have those thoughts been around? 

00:28:40
NAN Ah… Probably yes, I would have to see and think that’s one of the reasons that’s kinda pushed me into coming in. 

00:28:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:28:50
NAN You know, because they’re beginning to become frequent like I would say… 

00:28:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Can you say, I don’t know if you have an idea of how frequent… 

00:28:55
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:29:00
DR. BRENT BEAM …this, this happens for you? 

00:29:00
NAN Well probably, they every couple of days, every few days, every four or five days… 

00:29:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:29:05
NAN You know, I guess, I described that darkness would come, you know the idea to just exist in nothingness, I would describe it as. 

00:29:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Oh… 

00:29:15
NAN …would come. Yeah. 

00:29:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Just to kinda not, not be here. 

00:29:20
NAN Yeah. Uh…Huh… 

00:29:20
DR. BRENT BEAM It, it’s really interesting to me, umm… what keeps you from following up on that. 

00:29:25
NAN Umm… Well, I think a lot of my family for one and how devastated they would be if I did that. 

00:29:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:29:35
NAN Umm… I think about how hard I’ve worked in order to, you know, be where I am and how it was just, how defeated the entire purpose and… 

00:29:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:29:45
NAN Every single bad thing that I ever gone through it would just totally erase it. 

00:29:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Oh… 

00:29:50
NAN So, I think about that too you know. 

00:29:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:29:50
NAN You can do this, you just have to tell, you know, keep moving on, you know try to motivate yourself. 

00:30:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:30:00
NAN You know, don’t be selfish, think about the other people who’re going to be effected I guess… 

00:30:05
DR. BRENT BEAM I see. 

00:30:05
NAN If you’re to make this decision. 

00:30:10
DR. BRENT BEAM I see and, and so far those, those things have kept you safe. 

00:30:15
NAN Yeah. 

00:30:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. I, I’m really glad Nan that you brought that up and that you’re willing to share some of that with me. Umm… I, I again like some other things we’ve mentioned already. I’d really hope that that can be something that we talk about again and I, I want to make sure to follow up with you about that. Umm… Because, it to me it, one, it’s little bit of a scary thing… 

00:30:35
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:30:35
DR. BRENT BEAM …to have that experience. Umm… Two, I’d want to make sure it doesn’t get worse for you, clearly you’re coming here hoping that it gets better. 

00:30:45
NAN Yeah. 

00:30:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… and three, it, it really signifies to me how a dark of a place you, you might be in or have been in, in the past months. Umm… and again, I hear that, that something you really wanting to experience differently in the future as that you wanna feel better. 

00:31:05
NAN Yeah. 

00:31:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Not feel isolated. 

00:31:05
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:31:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… Not be in such a dark place… 

00:31:10
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:31:10
DR. BRENT BEAM …that you, you feel like a good option would be to end everything. 

00:31:15
NAN Yeah. 

00:31:20
DR. BRENT BEAM How would you feel if we talked about that again when we meet next time. 

00:31:20
NAN I mean it, it could be possible. 

00:31:25
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh…Huh… 

00:31:25
NAN Yeah. 

00:31:25
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. 

00:31:25
NAN Once you’re not gonna call and tell anybody. 

00:31:30
DR. BRENT BEAM I, I wouldn’t umm…, umm… the only instance is when I would call would kinda break confidentiality if you tell me that you’re really definitely you gonna follow through with that. 

00:31:40
NAN Okay. 

00:31:45
DR. BRENT BEAM And you’re pretty sure of a plan and when it’s gonna happen and how its gonna happen, and part of my responsibility as a psychologist is to make sure that you’re safe. Umm… and I would do that in the way that I… that would honor your privacy as, as much as possible. 

00:32:00
NAN Okay. 

00:32:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… which is another reason why for me, it feels important that we talk about that here, umm… if you end up getting to place where things are really bad, I would want us to be able to work on that as much as we can. 

00:32:10
NAN Okay. 

00:32:15
DR. BRENT BEAM And so, it sounds like you, you’re, your understanding, I’m assuming that, that I’ll bring this up again, and, and I help you understand that, I, I get this is a touching thing for you. 

00:32:25
NAN Yes, very, very touching. 

00:32:30
DR. BRENT BEAM So, so, we can kind of. 

00:32:30
NAN Uncomfortable. 

00:32:30
DR. BRENT BEAM Uncomfortable. 

00:32:30
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:32:30
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah, yeah. Well, if you’re, if you’re on board, I would say let’s work together on that. 

00:32:40
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:32:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:32:40
NAN Okay. 

00:32:45
DR. BRENT BEAM I, I’d like to, to ask a little bit more about the other symptoms that you’re describing. 

00:32:50
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:32:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… trace of any of those other things have come up for you prior to the last six months. 

00:32:55
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:32:55
DR. BRENT BEAM That, umm… disruption of sleep, concentration, withdrawing, feeling more isolated. If those have cropped up at other points in your life. 

00:33:05
NAN Umm… When I first came, when I first moved to the U.S., you know, I did feel somewhat isolated… 

00:33:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:33:10
NAN …and I did tend to withdraw myself from, I guess the people around me. 

00:33:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:33:15
NAN Umm… but I’ll change once I became more comfortable, umm… in terms of my sleeping habits, I… in terms of how much I study, I typically go to bed late, get up early, so my sleeping patterns have always been, yes disrupted to a certain extent. 

00:33:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:33:35
NAN Umm…my appetite. 

00:33:35
DR. BRENT BEAM And you saying that’s partly because of your, your school(ph) and work schedule. 

00:33:40
NAN Yeah. 

00:33:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. 

00:33:40
NAN But it’s only now that it’s I guess it has become more intense… 

00:33:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:33:45
NAN In terms of not being able to sleep at all versus just being able to sleep for a few hours. 

00:33:55
DR. BRENT BEAM And that’s what I was wondering about, you know, how much sleep you’re getting at this point in time. 

00:34:00
NAN Not a whole a lot. 

00:34:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Do you have an idea how many hours you might get on average per night during the week. 

00:34:05
NAN Umm, if I’m lucky probably two or three. 

00:34:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Gosh. 

00:34:10
NAN Yeah, I tend to toss and turn until and you see toss and turn until the clock turns to what like 4 or 5 am. 

00:34:20
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:34:20
NAN Yeah. 

00:34:20
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. 

00:34:20
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:34:20
DR. BRENT BEAM And during the day, I’m imagining, you might feel pretty tired. 

00:34:25
NAN Yeah. Oh yeah, exhausted, but… 

00:34:30
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:34:30
NAN I’ve to, you know, I’ve to keep going, I’ve to, I tend to drink a lot of energy drinks to kinda like keep myself up. 

00:34:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh…Huh… 

00:34:35
NAN I know, it’s not, you know, the best way, but at this point, I don’t really have a choice unless I want to feel and be put out of school or something. 

00:34:45
DR. BRENT BEAM I see. 

00:34:45
NAN Yeah. 

00:34:45
DR. BRENT BEAM So, you’re really driving yourself to, to keep going. 

00:34:50
NAN Yeah. 

00:34:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Against some really difficult odds right now. 

00:34:55
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:34:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Do you know how far back your sleep has been this, this much off… 

00:35:00
NAN Hmm… 

00:35:00
DR. BRENT BEAM It’s been a few days, few weeks… 

00:35:00
NAN You mean in terms of me just getting like one or two hours of sleep. 

00:35:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:35:05
NAN I say more so within the past few weeks like after the break up… 

00:35:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:35:10
NAN …more so. Yeah 

00:35:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. 

00:35:10
NAN Just I guess thinking about whether or not it was a right decision and you know just like I’m guessing myself… 

00:35:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:35:20
NAN Yeah. 

00:35:25
DR. BRENT BEAM What… Nan we’ve been talking for a while about… 

00:35:25
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:35:25
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… quite a number of things. Umm… things that are concerning to you and, and we’ve talked around a little bit about what you might want out of counseling. 

00:35:35
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:35:35
DR. BRENT BEAM And it’s a little bit difficult being here… 

00:35:40
NAN Yeah. 

00:35:40
DR. BRENT BEAM …already. I really interested if you can put in your own words more about you know what you’re expecting out of the counseling experience? 

00:35:45
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:35:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… maybe even what you’re expecting out of me as your counselor? 

00:35:50
NAN Uh…Huh… Umm… Well definitely some kind of support just knowing that they’re somebody that I can talk to about, you know my problems and what I’m going through. 

00:36:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh…Huh… 

00:36:05
NAN …somebody who is not going to go and tell everybody else. 

00:36:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. 

00:36:10
NAN And you know kinda of help me to figure out what I can do in order to I guess deal with some of these things that I’ve been experiencing like… 

00:36:20
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:36:20
NAN …help to me to be able to sleep better. 

00:36:20
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:36:20
NAN And you know, monitor my appetite, yeah just help me to have a better living experience. 

00:36:30
DR. BRENT BEAM So, things like some support. 

00:36:30
NAN Yeah. 

00:36:30
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… but making sure it’s confidential. 

00:36:35
NAN Yes. 

00:36:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Your privacy seems really important. 

00:36:40
NAN Definitely. 

00:36:40
DR. BRENT BEAM And, and developing, may be some strategies you can use to both to yourself up and outside of our conversations. 

00:36:45
NAN Yeah. 

00:36:50
DR. BRENT BEAM And it’s seems also like clearly you’re wanting some of these symptoms to, to diminish or go entirely. 

00:36:55
NAN Yeah. 

00:36:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. Ah other things, other expectation that you might have of counseling. 

00:37:00
NAN Umm… I hope that you know that I can all kinda diminish, gets over to next few weeks, I’m hoping. 

00:37:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. 

00:37:10
NAN Because I’m getting really, really tired of not being able to sleep. 

00:37:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:37:15
NAN And feeling so down. 

00:37:20
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh…Huh… 

00:37:20
NAN You know. 

00:37:20
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh…Huh… 

00:37:20
NAN And just forcing myself to look perky and look happy when I’m really not. 

00:37:30
DR. BRENT BEAM It seems really exhausting. 

00:37:30
NAN Yes. 

00:37:30
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:37:30
NAN Very much so… 

00:37:30
DR. BRENT BEAM And then so, really within a few weeks is what you’re hoping to when you’re hoping to see some change. 

00:37:35
NAN Yeah. 

00:37:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. 

00:37:35
NAN Because I’m just, I’ve really had enough… 

00:37:40
DR. BRENT BEAM It, it sounds like you’re near the end of your rope with this. 

00:37:45
NAN Yes. 

00:37:45
DR. BRENT BEAM It’s been going on for too long. 

00:37:45
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:37:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. Any umm… any concerns about counseling, about things that, things that you wouldn’t want to experience here. 

00:37:55
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:37:55
DR. BRENT BEAM And, and I’m asking this I guess partly because you mention your privacy and, and feeling some shame about mentioning, umm… the kind of suicidal thoughts. 

00:38:05
NAN Yeah 

00:38:05
DR. BRENT BEAM And so I, I’m aware that there is some hesitation just wanna make sure that we’re, we’re talking about that too. 

00:38:10
NAN Uh…Huh… Umm… Oh… I’m just looking for, you know somebody who is willing to I guess ask question, then not just assume… 

00:38:25
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh…Huh… 

00:38:25
NAN …that I’m, a certain way or anything like that. 

00:38:25
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:38:25
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh…Huh… 

00:38:30
NAN (inaudible ) definitely somebody who is open minded and understanding. 

00:38:31
DR. BRENT BEAM I see. 

00:38:31
NAN That’s the biggest thing for me and also just somebody who is not gonna go, you know talk about what goes on in session, because that’s a big issue for me. 

00:38:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:38:45
NAN Umm… That’s why I decided to come to you know a counselor professionals versus trying to talk to just a regular person. 

00:38:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Sure… 

00:38:50
NAN Yeah. 

00:38:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Sure. Okay. We’re in just, just to review it again, umm… in case, there was any, any need to hear this, umm, as a psychologist umm, I’m ethically bound to keep our conversation confidential. 

00:39:05
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:39:10
DR. BRENT BEAM And really the only essence is that I would ever break that confidentiality as if you tell me that you’re really at serious risk for hurting yourself. 

00:39:15
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:39:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… or if you have serious intent to hurt somebody else. Umm. In our state if you report child abuse or elder abuse as your instances when I actually have to break up confidentiality and… 

00:39:25
NAN Okay. 

00:39:25
DR. BRENT BEAM …pass that information along, but other than that everything you say here stays here. 

00:39:30
NAN Okay. 

00:39:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm…and if we get to the point where some of those other topics become part of our conversation, I’ll let you know that we’re getting close to that line of confidentiality. 

00:39:40
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:39:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… both because I would care that, that you, I care for you to make a decision that you feel good about. 

00:39:50
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:39:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm…and I wanted to do what I can to ensure that you’re taking care of. 

00:39:50
NAN Okay. 

00:39:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Is that make sense? 

00:39:55
NAN Yeah that, that makes me feel a bit more comfortable with the situation. 

00:40:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. 

00:40:00
NAN Yeah. 

00:40:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Well, and I, I think Nan that your other goals for therapy and your expectations of counseling and, and of me as your counselor are umm… kinda extremely appropriate. 

00:40:15
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:40:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm…things that I feel confident that you can experience in counseling, umm or to know that I’m interested in, in you finding ways to feel good outside of our… 

00:40:25
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:40:25
DR. BRENT BEAM …of our work together. I think a lot of good can come from counseling sessions themselves. Umm…but of all your work is done in here then still the rest of your life that needs some, some attention. 

00:40:35
NAN That’s right. 

00:40:35
DR. BRENT BEAM So, Umm…I, I can commit you to, to doing those things to helping you umm…feel supported umm…to asking you questions. 

00:40:45
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:40:45
DR. BRENT BEAM I hope you let me know if you feel like I’m not asking enough questions and I, I think you can expect to feel better, umm… sooner than later that these umm… certainly a lot of symptoms seem pretty connected to, to the circumstances in your life and as the circumstance changes as you gain new perspective on it and feel other support around that, I’m willing to umm… really to suggest that these symptoms are going to improve pretty quickly for you. I’m also gonna wanna monitor that with you… 

00:41:20
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:41:20
DR. BRENT BEAM …and if they don’t, lets both know about it and we will do other things to make sure that, umm… that you feel better. So, I wanna check them with you and again, follow up on this kind of initial thing you brought up about your hesitation about being counseling, crazed(ph) to know how you’re feeling at this point about and coming back in the future. 

00:41:45
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:41:45
DR. BRENT BEAM That something you’ll be open to doing. 

00:41:45
NAN Yeah, I will be open to… umm… coming back, but I’ve to be honest and say that I’m still not 100%… 

00:41:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh…Huh… 

00:41:55
NAN Comfortable… 

00:41:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh…Huh… 

00:41:55
NAN But I’m willing to I guess try, you know make an effort to see how the situation works out. 

00:42:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. 

00:42:00
NAN Yeah. 

00:42:05
DR. BRENT BEAM So, so even with some hesitation, still willing to come back… 

00:42:05
NAN Yeah. 

00:42:05
DR. BRENT BEAM …and give it a shot. 

00:42:05
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:42:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Okay. Well, I think we can work with that. 

00:42:10
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:42:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:42:15
De-Briefing of Session One with Dr. Beam, Nan, and Dr. Woodsmall 

00:42:20
DR. BRENT BEAM We are now joined by Dr. Craig Woodsmall, who is going to facilitate a commentary and debriefing of this first intake demonstration. 

00:42:30
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Okay, ah, first off, I want to say what a nice job, a good example of first appointment or intake with the client... 

00:42:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… 

00:42:35
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL … both did. 

00:42:35
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:42:40
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Umm…and to get started it off, I think I wanna start with you Nan, I’m wondering, umm…, just from your experience in… 

00:42:45
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:42:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …in ah, talking with ah Dr. Beam, what it was like for you? 

00:42:50
NAN Okay, umm, well it was a very comfortable experience, you know, his demeanor was very, is in very calm and open and also, I guess welcoming to certain extent, so it made me feel really comfortable talking to him. 

00:43:05
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

00:43:05
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:43:10
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Much easier when it’s feels welcoming. 

00:43:10
NAN Definitely, yeah. 

00:43:10
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Okay, okay. And for you Brent, what in your opinion went well, that you like. 

00:43:15
DR. BRENT BEAM You know, I, I thought that umm, Nan actually covered her concerns pretty clearly. I, I don't feel like I had to work too hard for this. 

00:43:25
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Hahaha... 

00:43:25
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… Nan has a, she is pretty insightful and articulate about what’s going on in her life and has a good grasp of it. Umm… it was really I think, ah, a good thing that she initiated a discussion about her cultural identity, and then we talked about that, umm… to some degree at least in the first session. 

00:43:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh…Huh… 

00:43:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… seems to me that’s important to have that discussion as soon as possible and clearly it’s, it’s pretty salient for her at this point in her life. 

00:43:55
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right, it may not be the case that, that every client will initiate that… 

00:44:00
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:44:00
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …conversation about cultural identity and certainly made your job a little bit easier. 

00:44:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Absolutely. 

00:44:05
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Nan I’m wondering how it felt for you to talk about that parts, those parts of your identity. 

00:44:10
NAN Okay, umm… Well it was a relief being able to talk about it. 

00:44:15
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Hmm… 

00:44:15
NAN Because, typically, I don’t because of all the assumptions and who wants to explain over and over and over and over again. 

00:44:25
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

00:44:25
NAN So, umm… based upon like the questions he asked me and my responses, he seem to really understand where I was coming from… 

00:44:30
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Hmm… 

00:44:30
NAN And that was really good. 

00:44:35
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Okay. 

00:44:35
NAN Yeah. 

00:44:35
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Hmm…I know Brent that sometimes beginning counselors are concerned about bringing this up… 

00:44:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:44:40
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …and asking about cultural identity. 

00:44:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh…Huh… 

00:44:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Umm… What’s your take on, on that having heard that Nan’s experience was that it was relief. 

00:44:50
DR. BRENT BEAM You know even having been a professional counselor for a number of years, it’s, it’s still I recognized that it’s a touchy subject for a lot of people. 

00:44:55
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:44:55
DR. BRENT BEAM And I still feel my own hesitation with most clients when I bring up conversation around cultural identity just as I would when I’m bringing up a conversation around suicide ideation. 

00:45:05
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:45:10
DR. BRENT BEAM It, it’s a touchy subject. Umm…to hear Nan say that she felt relieved talking about it, is, is reassuring and reminds me that it’s less about my concern and it’s more about that this is something that needs to be talked about. 

00:45:20
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

00:45:20
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… and clearly Nan’s experience isn’t unique in other words. 

00:45:25
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:45:25
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… I guess my thinking about you know beginning counselors, umm… I think that can be something to take to heart… 

00:45:35
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:45:35
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

00:45:35
DR. BRENT BEAM The people typically really appreciate the chance to talk about their cultural identity. 

00:45:40
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. So even for us counselors if it’s a little anxiety… 

00:45:45
NAN Hmm... 

00:45:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh...Huh... 

00:45:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …producing to put that question out on the table, it’s in the best client, it’s in the best interest… 

00:45:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:45:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …of the client to do so. 

00:45:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Sure definitely. Yeah. 

00:45:50
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:45:50
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Oh good. Umm… one of the things that I think is often difficult to get a feel for in developing your style of doing an intake as a counselor is learning how to balance letting the client tell their story. 

00:46:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:46:05
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL With getting the important information that the facts that you’ll need to make some clinical decisions about… 

00:46:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh...Huh... 

00:46:15
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL How did you as you’re talking with Nan umm… think about balancing those two needs. 

00:46:20
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… You know Nan’s disclosure that counseling is something that she is uncomfortable with and hesitant about was in my mind the whole time and umm… I, I tried, I hope it was effective I, I certainly tried to acknowledge her concerns and in that way to built some kind of comfort and trust with me. Umm… and at the same time, she is, she is going through a difficult period of her life and her symptoms are certainly challenging and of concern to me as her therapist and certainly her as the person who is experiencing them. 

00:46:55
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:46:55
DR. BRENT BEAM And so, I’m not sure exactly how, but, but those two things were in my head the whole time that it’s important for me to show that I can alive with her concerns and her doubts about counseling and understand that. 

00:47:10
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:47:10
DR. BRENT BEAM And part of my(ph) understand that is by assessing her situation. 

00:47:15
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

00:47:15
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:47:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Gathering the right information. 

00:47:15
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

00:47:15
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:47:20
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL So, from your point of view, it’s important to kinda you both there might not be a specific formula for how much time you spend on one of the other. 

00:47:25
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh...Huh... 

00:47:25
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL But I get the sense(ph) for you Brent that it’s more important to focus on making that connection with the client. 

00:47:30
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh...Huh... 

00:47:30
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Umm… even if you don’t get all the information. 

00:47:35
DR. BRENT BEAM That’s my style. Umm… and it seems to work for me and certainly every therapist has their own style and agenda with that. Umm… I think if Nan had mentioned concerns, if her concerns hadn’t had the same kind of level of severity to them, I’d be less likely to, to dig for a lot of information in the first session. 

00:48:00
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:48:00
DR. BRENT BEAM And would feel little bit more comfortable splitting(ph) that over two sessions. 

00:48:05
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Hmm… 

00:48:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm…given her concerns and given the recent suicide ideation… 

00:48:05
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh...Huh... 

00:48:10
DR. BRENT BEAM …that let’s me know that report building is essential, but it’s not the only thing that has to happen in the session. 

00:48:15
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:48:15
DR. BRENT BEAM In fact there needs to be a pretty good follow up about her symptoms. 

00:48:15
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:48:20
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Absolutely. 

00:48:20
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:48:20
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL And that you mention that the point in, in the intake when you were ah… trying to assess level for risk for herself. 

00:48:25
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:48:25
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Umm… I wanted to come back to that… 

00:48:25
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:48:30
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …with you Nan and ask umm… how did you perceive Brent’s responses to…umm… the discomfort that you’re feeling in talking about that. 

00:48:45
NAN Ah… well he seemed really intone(ph) with my discomfort and because of being intone(ph) with my discomfort he also seemed really able to make me comfortable in terms of the way he asked the questions and like his overall tone of voice. 

00:49:00
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

00:49:00
NAN Yeah. 

00:49:00
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL I was, I was also umm… noticing that, that you even went so far as to open up communication, about the communication between the two of you... 

00:49:10
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:49:10
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …lets talk about it again and specifically, let Nan know that you would be asking again. 

00:49:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:49:15
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Even though, it’s uncomfortable. 

00:49:20
NAN Yeah. 

00:49:20
DR. BRENT BEAM And, and I’ll see it’s a little bit of concern to me that that she is presenting with some recent suicide ideation. 

00:49:25
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:49:25
DR. BRENT BEAM And is hesitant about returning to counseling, umm… and I’m just aware that I was trying to balance that in the moment that umm… do what I can to motivate her to return and build on her own, umm, kinda momentum for being here. 

00:49:40
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:49:40
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

00:49:45
DR. BRENT BEAM But it’s not a guarantee. 

00:49:45
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:49:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL I know, right I notice that you were attempting to do that, trying to kinda instill some hope in Nan that counseling could be, you know beneficial to her provide some relief, umm… and maybe other counselors wouldn’t have gone so far as to, umm… suggest that so directly. 

00:50:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh...Huh... 

00:50:05
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL So, it’s kinda curious what your opinion is that not that you promised her that she would feel better, but you somewhat suggested that, that odds are if she came back, umm… it would be helpful. 

00:50:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Sure. Well it’s, it has been my experience that usually (inaudible ) most of you. Umm... it, I, I could tell that I wanted to make some promise to her and, and of course I knew, in nowadays we can’t guarantee that, umm, my, my sense is that because her experience is, was at least initially kinda catalyzed by this break up a number of months ago. 

00:50:40
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:50:45
DR. BRENT BEAM As she resolves that there’s a pretty good chance that some of her symptoms are gonna remit. 

00:50:50
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:50:50
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

00:50:50
DR. BRENT BEAM She seems to have a lot of personal strengths and is able to understand her own situation well. Umm… her connection with her family seems really important. So, I’m thinking that as we can boaster those kinda positive areas in her life she’ll also experience umm… an improvement in her symptoms. 

00:51:05
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

00:51:10
DR. BRENT BEAM And of course, we can’t guarantee it, but… 

00:51:10
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

00:51:10
DR. BRENT BEAM I’m hopeful and I want to convey my hope to her… 

00:51:15
NAN Umm... 

00:51:15
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah that came across very clearly. 

00:51:15
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:51:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:51:15
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Nan I’m wondering if there were areas that you, umm… or may be hoping to talk about, umm… during the intake that weren’t asked… 

00:51:25
NAN Hmm... 

00:51:25
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …and didn’t get too… 

00:51:30
NAN No, may be the one area would be more, umm… maybe try to get more information about my relationship with my boyfriend 

00:51:35
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh...Huh... 

00:51:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh...Huh... 

00:51:35
NAN Yeah, maybe talking about that situation a bit more, but that’s probably the only thing. 

00:51:40
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL So, would have helpful to spent a little bit a more time… 

00:51:45
NAN Yeah. 

00:51:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …getting history of that relationship. 

00:51:45
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:51:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL And how it began and umm… what aspects both positive and negative were a part of that relationship. 

00:51:55
NAN Yeah. 

00:51:55
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Okay, yeah. We will see that. Umm…and they, that gets me think something else Brent, which is I noticed that you didn’t take any notes. 

00:52:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:52:00
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL During the interview. 

00:52:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh...Huh... 

00:52:05
NAN Hmm... 

00:52:05
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL And I’m wondering what your philosophy is about that. 

00:52:05
NAN Umm... 

00:52:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh...Huh... 

00:52:05
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL To take notes or not take notes during the interview. 

00:52:10
DR. BRENT BEAM I, I’ve tried both ways, umm… I, I tend to be really distracted when I’m taking notes. 

00:52:15
NAN Hmm… 

00:52:15
DR. BRENT BEAM And it’s harder for me to feel like a connection with my client and I think my, whatever interpersonal skills I have are kinda hampered by having a notepad between the client and myself. Umm… On rare circumstances, I will use a notepad if, if there is a lot of really critical information coming very quickly. 

00:52:40
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh...Huh... 

00:52:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… before we get too far pass my client and ask if there are okay with that I’ll take notes. Umm… I, I tried to attend to what I thought were the most important aspects of Nan's story, knowing that I, I’d missed something to be need to followup 

00:52:50
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Sure. 

00:52:50
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:52:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… So, I my philosophy is its, its if it work for you… 

00:53:00
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL It is a good philosophy. 

00:53:00
NAN Hmm... 

00:53:00
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL And, and it makes me think too about even if there is information that you miss that is not that the assessment phase ends after an intake that.. 

00:53:10
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:53:10
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Good counselors… 

00:53:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh...Huh... 

00:53:10
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …you know continue to collect that important information in subsequent session. 

00:53:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Absolutely yeah, yeah… 

00:53:15
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Very good. Umm… I would like to move on to may be discuss a few specific moments during the intake things that… 

00:53:25
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:53:25
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL That you asked specifically of Nan and, and responses that you gave... 

00:53:30
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:53:30
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …during the intake. Umm… That the first thing umm… that I noticed was your question, Nan was talking about the break up having recently occurred and your response was that you’re curious how that decision was made. 

00:53:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:53:50
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL And umm… I found that very kinda effective way to phrase a question that was… 

00:53:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… 

00:53:55
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …can you tell us may be a little bit about how you choose to ask that. 

00:54:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Well, I’m not sure if Nan had mentioned this at that point she may have, but I certainly was getting the impression that she was a little bit held back, umm… not entirely comfortable disclosing everything at once. And I wanted to get more information and let her know I was interested but also give her full permission to say whatever she wanted to say and not really pressure her to say anything. 

00:54:25
NAN Umm... 

00:54:30
DR. BRENT BEAM So talking about in terms of my curiosity, instead of, I need you to tell me this or what happened. 

00:54:35
NAN Uh...huh... 

00:54:35
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right, right. 

00:54:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm... I, I hope it was a general way of kind of expressing that this, that I am interested that I see that it's important, I would like to know more and it's her choice, how much and when she shares that. 

00:54:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. She is very intentional. 

00:54:50
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:54:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:54:50
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL On your part to, to show that you are interested, but to do that in a way that gave her the freedom to kind a respond… 

00:54:55
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:55:00
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL ...umm, in the way that was most comfortable to her. 

00:55:00
NAN Uh...huh... 

00:55:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Absolutely. 

00:55:00
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah, very good. 

00:55:00
NAN Uh...Huh... 

00:55:00
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Is that match with ah, you know kind of what it felt like for you... 

00:55:05
NAN Yeah, that's definitely what I felt like. Uh…huh… 

00:55:10
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Very good. Ah, the next thing I, I noticed is that, umm, umm, one second hahaha. Ah, that Brent you had, ah, on a number of occasions, ah when talking about Nan's cultural identity had reflected back to her, ah about the uniqueness and kind of the importance of that and ah, I was wondering kind of what you are hoping to kinda communicate at those times. 

00:55:50
DR. BRENT BEAM That's a great question. Umm… I, may be what I was hoping to communicate was that I'd understood that this was really important for her. Umm… not so much that I thought her cultural identity was unique, I, I do but that was less of my intention, ah, more that, that it's so important to her and so unique that she hasn't found a lot of support or understanding for this generally. 

00:56:10
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Hmm... 

00:56:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm... And I wanted again a kind of as a way of building report to let her know that I understood at least that aspect of it and then you understood that well. 

00:56:20
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah, Oh yeah. It reminds me of the, the kinda famous quote from Carl Rogers about how important it is to praise our clients… 

00:56:30
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:56:30
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:56:30
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …and to highlight their, ah, the unique aspects of their self and their identity. 

00:56:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm... 

00:56:35
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL I noticed that you did that on, on a multiple points during the interview, and felt that was very nice. 

00:56:40
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:56:40
DR. BRENT BEAM It's a good feedback. 

00:56:40
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:56:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Umm... Where there any, any things that ah, from your perspective Brent that could, could have been improved during the interview. Things that you would have done differently. 

00:56:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… No, I, I think I would have like to have done a little bit more vigorous assessment of her symptoms. 

00:57:00
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:57:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… And if we had more time, umm, to explore in little bit more detail what the sleep has been like for her… 

00:57:10
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:57:15
DR. BRENT BEAM …umm, what the appetite loss has been like for her. How much she eats. 

00:57:15
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

00:57:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Ah, really did to to get a lot of specific information about that, ah that will help me understand where she is and then kinda give us both a baseline measurement that we can use to refer back to and see how much she is progressing and, and at what pace. No, there is another area that we didn't get to, which was talking about Nan's family background… 

00:57:35
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh…Huh… 

00:57:35
DR. BRENT BEAM …we talked a little bit about her cultural identity. 

00:57:40
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:57:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Ah, in that she identifies as West Indian, but I didn't get to talking about ah, what a family structure, family dynamic, due to what it's like for her to be in the States or her family member here or not? 

00:57:50
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:57:50
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

00:57:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Ah, and that's really important, ah, whole set of information to have on the hand and then, I am imaging really important to Nan as well. 

00:58:00
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:58:00
DR. BRENT BEAM So that would be something to improve upon or at least follow up on during our next meeting. 

00:58:05
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Absolutely, I know that's, ah, our standard area for assessing in the… 

00:58:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

00:58:10
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …in the first meeting with the client and ah, gives us various counselors, very rich… 

00:58:15
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:58:15
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …ah, detailed information, so that our understanding of, of clients, ah is great. Uh…Huh… Good. 

00:58:20
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:58:25
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Umm… towards the end of the intake you began to talk about how Nan is feeling about counseling. 

00:58:30
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:58:30
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL What her expectations were, umm, and goals. 

00:58:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh…Huh… 

00:58:35
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL What she would like to have be different as a result of working with you. 

00:58:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Sure. 

00:58:40
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Umm... The process that, that you did that was seemed very transparent to me. 

00:58:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm... 

00:58:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Ah, and multiple points you talked with Nan about… 

00:58:50
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:58:50
V …how does that sound, is this is kind of what you had in mind. 

00:58:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

00:58:55
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL How standard is that for you in terms of your start. 

00:59:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Ah, in, I am not sure if this is exactly what you're getting out, I, I try to articulate an, an attitude of collaboration with most clients. Um, and with Nan in particular to me it seem pretty important that she see me as someone who is on board with her. 

00:59:15
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:59:15
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

00:59:15
DR. BRENT BEAM And someone that she can trust and who is kind of a (inaudible ) and, and this gonna not work for her, but work on her behalf. 

00:59:20
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

00:59:20
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:59:20
DR. BRENT BEAM And work with her. So, umm, so I think it's standard that I am gonna voice that ah, that um that I’m there, I’m with the person and I’m… 

00:59:30
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:59:30
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh…Huh… 

00:59:30
DR. BRENT BEAM …working for them. Um, and I was trying to be more explicit about that to Nan this time. 

00:59:40
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:59:40
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Nan, I noticed that your response to that was, was also very open and direct… 

00:59:45
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:59:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …you still had some reservations about ah... 

00:59:50
NAN Yeah. 

00:59:50
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …coming back. 

00:59:50
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:59:50
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Which I think was very helpful… 

00:59:50
NAN Uh…Huh… 

00:59:50
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …you know to put on the table for him to hear. Umm, how easy was that for you, ah, as the client to kinda tell the counselor, well I am not sure if I am really gonna come back to see. 

01:00:05
NAN Uh…Huh… Well you know because I had already expressed that have some trepidation about being in a counseling in a first place. 

01:00:10
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh…Huh… 

01:00:10
NAN You know, I really wanted to make sure that he really saw where I was coming from… 

01:00:15
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:00:15
NAN …and so that he didn't, I guess, maybe didn’t get his hopes up too high… 

01:00:20
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:00:20
NAN …in terms of me coming back, and I also wanted to make sure that he realize that it wasn't about, ah his skills as a counselor, but more so about… 

01:00:30
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yes. 

01:00:30
NAN …my feelings. 

01:00:30
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:00:30
NAN Yeah. 

01:00:30
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL It really was about what ah, felt best for you… 

01:00:35
NAN Yes, uh…huh… 

01:00:35
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …and your concern. 

01:00:35
NAN Yeah. 

01:00:35
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah, and I, I noticed that you didn't ah overreact to this. 

01:00:40
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

01:00:40
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL You didn't jump in and try to persuade her how wonderful counseling is… 

01:00:45
NAN Hahaha… 

01:00:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …you really should come back. 

01:00:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

01:00:50
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Um, and it reminded me of how, ah, being a counselor often have to sit with, ah situations that are ambiguous for unclear… 

01:00:55
NAN Uh…Huh… 

01:00:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm... 

01:01:00
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL ...ah, may be a client will come back and maybe they won't. 

01:01:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Sure, sure, and, and Nan sitting with her ambiguity with this. 

01:01:05
NAN Umm, yeah. 

01:01:05
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:01:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm... Some, something of being undecided ah, and since from hearing what Nan just said that… 

01:01:15
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Hmm... 

01:01:15
DR. BRENT BEAM …that we kind of met in that space… 

01:01:15
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Hmm… 

01:01:15
DR. BRENT BEAM …ah, that I would hope that she heard that I understand her hesitation. 

01:01:25
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:01:25
DR. BRENT BEAM And then I don't see that making a strong, I feel(ph) especially at point is gonna do either so(ph) lot of good. 

01:01:30
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:01:30
DR. BRENT BEAM Ah, but I did try to articulate both in a personal way that I care about her concerns and umm, from a clinical perspective that I, I'm taking her very seriously… 

01:01:40
NAN Hmm… 

01:01:40
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Hmm… 

01:01:40
DR. BRENT BEAM …and that some of the specific things need to be followed up on. 

01:01:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. And that was clear as well. 

01:01:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

01:01:45
NAN Uh…Huh… 

01:01:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL May be, as a, as a way to kind of begin to wrap up this debriefing… 

01:01:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Uh…Huh… 

01:01:50
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …ah, you can talk a little bit about ah, what your diagnostic thoughts were… 

01:01:55
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… Uh…Huh… 

01:02:00
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …and how that might connect to you if Nan came back… 

01:02:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Hmm… 

01:02:05
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL What would be your focus in subsequent session? 

01:02:05
DR. BRENT BEAM Sure, sure, the, the things that come to my mind pretty quickly for me are wondering if this is a depressive episode that's been ongoing for, some portion of the last six months. Umm, or if this would more, be more of kind of adjustment disorder with a lot of depressive symptoms evident with that. Ah, I think in terms of how to handle that, my, my initial, my work in the next two sessions is not gonna look a whole lot different depending on the diagnosis. 

01:02:35
NAN Uh…Huh… 

01:02:35
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:02:35
DR. BRENT BEAM Ah, one because I think I am still gathering information about how to make that differential diagnosis. Umm… and two, there can be some basic things that Nan does on her own, or that we can do it together… 

01:02:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Hmm... 

01:02:45
DR. BRENT BEAM …that'll help the symptoms remit anyway. 

01:02:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Okay. 

01:02:50
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… I, I'm expecting that as our social support picks up a little bit, she feel little bit more connected and less isolated. Ah I want to work with her around connecting with the people who are in her life, other than her ex-boyfriend… 

01:03:00
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:03:00
NAN Uh…Huh… 

01:03:00
DR. BRENT BEAM …family members, may be co-workers or other students… 

01:03:05
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:03:05
DR. BRENT BEAM ...you know peers that she has. Ah, we know that social support is a really big factor for lot of people. 

01:03:10
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:03:15
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm, the other thing that I am gonna try to do is really further explore her strengths as an individual, and see if there are other ways that she can activate those strengths on a daily basis. 

01:03:25
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:03:25
DR. BRENT BEAM Umm… may be she has a creative streak in her and we can find a way to, to access that, ah, both in term of our conversation and it may be some hobbies that she may pursue… 

01:03:35
NAN Uh…Huh… 

01:03:35
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:03:35
DR. BRENT BEAM …umm, and I feel like we carry out with all this is, this is not my projection for a long course of therapy. 

01:03:40
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:03:40
DR. BRENT BEAM This would be kind of just some starting points and then we will build from there. 

01:03:45
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:03:45
NAN Uh…Huh… 

01:03:45
DR. BRENT BEAM But, wanna, wanna see if I can help Nan to get to a place where she is feeling more engaged, ah, experiencing a little bit more pleasure in her life. 

01:03:55
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:03:55
DR. BRENT BEAM May be finding some meaning that's been lost. 

01:03:55
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:04:00
DR. BRENT BEAM Reconnecting to that. 

01:04:00
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right, so really important to continue that assessment… 

01:04:00
NAN Uh… huh… 

01:04:00
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …but also begin working and reducing… 

01:04:05
NAN Yeah. 

01:04:05
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …some of the symptoms that you've been experiencing and in doing so by incorporating the use of her strength. 

01:04:10
NAN Uh… huh… 

01:04:10
DR. BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

01:04:10
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL And, ah, also um… it's clear that its tired to, ah, your model for, for therapy is may be not assuming that this is going to be a long term, ah, client that you see weekly for years, but… 

01:04:25
NAN Uh… huh… 

01:04:25
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …ah, much more time when that it approach. 

01:04:30
DR. BRENT BEAM That's my feeling at this point. 

01:04:30
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:04:30
NAN Uh… huh… 

01:04:30
DR. BRENT BEAM And as I gather more information, I think we'll, we'll know more clearly about that. 

01:04:35
NAN Uh… huh… 

01:04:35
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL Right, very good. Thank you both for um… 

01:04:40
NAN Thank you. 

01:04:40
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …talking about how the interview went… 

01:04:40
NAN Uh… huh… 

01:04:40
DR. CRAIG WOODSMALL …and again I thought it was an excellent example. 

01:04:40
NAN Uh… huh… 

01:04:45
DR. BRENT BEAM Thank you. 

01:04:45
NAN Thanks. 

01:04:50

Well let me tell you a little bit about the process and hopefully that I'll help you feel a little bit more ease, this session, ah, is what we call an intake session and basically I'm gonna be asking you a lot of questions today, probably a lot more questions than I would ask in a regular counseling session, but the purpose of the questions are to get you know you a little bit better to ah, understand your issue, or issues of concern. And to um, explore in a sense um, your current level of functioning, family background, um, look at goals that you might want to set and at the end of the process, I will be sharing with you some of my thoughts and impressions about what I think might be helpful for you, okay.

01:07:55

KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:08:20
KEVIN Umm, but ever since I've moved here, I feel like a little, my mood is lower, my energy level is decreased and, ah, quite often I get irritable.

01:08:55
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:09:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. Ah, Kevin, I just wanted to say before, ah, we go any further. I like to take notes, and I try to minimize the amount of writing… 

01:09:10
KEVIN That's right. 

01:09:10
KAROLYN SENTOR …so that I can pay attention on what you are saying, but is that okay with you?

KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:09:40
KEVIN And (inaudible ) to find some ways to change that. 

01:09:42
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay. And has anybody at work noticed these changes and said anything to you about it. 

01:09:50
KEVIN Umm, not really, I'm kinda, I'm pretty reserved about these feelings, but I think, it's… it's more about a individual like personal problem. 

01:09:55
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:10:00
KEVIN And, ah, just trying to seek support socially. 

01:10:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, so it's not affecting your performance to the point where you're having problems? 

01:10:05
KEVIN Great. 

01:10:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay, alright okay, and that sounds like this change in mood is very different than what you've used to. 

01:10:10
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:10:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, so tell me what it was like before you came here, what was it like for you when you engaged in activities or work or… 

01:10:20
KEVIN I think I was more like excited, umm… I was you know, not learned about a lot of things and I could go about doing anything without being rub the wrong way or seeing things, taking things personally. 

01:10:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:10:35
KEVIN But now, I feel like without umm, the social support that I had back at home… 

01:10:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:10:40
KEVIN …things are a little different and more, I guess defensive in my approach. 

01:10:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm… Okay, so ah, here you, you don't have the same level of social support, you have at home. 

01:10:50
KEVIN Correct. 

01:10:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, so what does it look like for you now. What is your social, social life look like since you've been here? 

01:10:55
KEVIN Umm, I really just converse with a lot of people at work. 

01:11:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:11:00
KEVIN Umm, I don't know that many Asian-American's here… 

01:11:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:11:05
KEVIN …in this town, ah, but I do go to Asian-American church. 

01:11:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:11:10
KEVIN Ah, so… 

01:11:10
KAROLYN SENTOR You go to an Asian-American church here? 

01:11:15
KEVIN Yes, yes. 

01:11:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Oh, okay, okay, but not a lot of Asian-American friends since you've been here? 

01:11:20
KEVIN Correct. 

01:11:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Well, what's your contact with your Asian-American friends that you had back home. 

01:11:25
KEVIN Umm, I, I call them every weekend and we do talking and, and, you know converse and see how things were going. 

01:11:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay. So, is umm… having a social group of Asian-American friends, what you think is missing for you here? 

01:11:40
KEVIN I believe so, umm…, maybe not specifically being Asian, but just a social support from any cultural background. 

01:11:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:11:50
KEVIN I believe it would be helpful. 

01:11:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay. So, Kevin, could you tell me a little bit more about what your experience umm, has been as a Chinese-American in your work place? 

01:12:00
KEVIN Umm, I, I really unaccepted, there is no bias or negative feedback coming from my co-workers and associates are very nice and open. 

01:12:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:12:10
KEVIN And, they're seeing my work ethic and they enjoy my presence, I feel, I really feel welcomed, ah, every day when I come to work. 

01:12:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. So you haven't experienced any, ah bias or prejudices… 

01:12:25
KEVIN No. 

01:12:30
KAROLYN SENTOR …or prejudice. Okay, okay. And what is it like when you leave work and go home. 

01:12:35
KEVIN That's when I begin to kinda feel lonely. 

01:12:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:12:40
KEVIN Ah, I turn on the radio, I try to keep my mind busy. 

01:12:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:12:45
KEVIN So that I don't, I don't fall into a sense of umm, the lack of social support I'd known to hang out with and, and so forth. 

01:12:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Umm… Is that when you find that your symptoms are more intense when you're at home alone? 

01:13:00
KEVIN Yes, yes. When I kinda, I wandered back at, at the work setting and see, how I maybe was a little more irritable… 

01:13:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:13:10
KEVIN …than I used to be and how I took things the wrong way… 

01:13:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… are there any specific things in the work place that are making you more irritable or? 

01:13:20
KEVIN I think when, when people are joke around… 

01:13:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:13:25
KEVIN …sometimes, I take their joke more seriously than intended. 

01:13:25
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:13:30
KEVIN And maybe it's because, I just don't feel like myself. 

01:13:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. Are there any particular themes to the jokes that are ah, disturbing? 

01:13:35
KEVIN No, it's just, they are all always different and they could be joking about you know, a celebrity or some ones hair and all of a sudden I would, I would just take it, I would take it personally. 

01:13:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm, hmm… hmm… Interesting, okay and so no particular themes but you're taking it personal, do you feel included in the jokes. 

01:14:00
KEVIN Ah, maybe, maybe, I put myself in those jokes and which makes me take it personal but also ah, I've had really negative, umm feeling towards when people become judgmental. 

01:14:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay, so some of the jokes might kind of imply some judgment on… 

01:14:15
KEVIN Umm… 

01:14:15
KAROLYN SENTOR …toward the other people while in the groups. 

01:14:20
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:14:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay, yeah. Umm…, Kevin, I wanted to ask some questions about your family background, umm… is all your family back, or all your family members back in the place where you came from? 

01:14:40
KEVIN No they're actually, they preside(ph) in the United States, ah, they came from China, and Hong Kong… 

01:14:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:14:45

01:15:00
KEVIN So, Umm…, they, they are, they are here. 

01:15:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. So they're all here in the US. 

01:15:05

KAROLYN SENTOR Okay and what, what's your relationship like with your family members, to your immediate family members? 

01:15:10

01:15:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Very close, okay. 

01:15:10
KEVIN …with all them and, Umm… we're very open about everything. 

01:15:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm, uh… huh… 

01:15:15
KEVIN And so, this is, this kinda setting is very-very different. 

01:15:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah, yeah. So probably missing them a lot… 

01:15:20
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:15:25

01:15:25

01:15:30
KEVIN Yes. 

01:15:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, umm, are they aware of the changes that you've been experiencing that you've been here. 

01:15:35
KEVIN Ah, I told them that, it might be just I'm tired… 

01:15:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:15:40
KEVIN …but they do know that I am not feeling 100%… 

01:15:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:15:45
KEVIN …ah, like myself. 

01:15:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm… It sounds like you, well, help me understanding this, but are you minimizing your symptoms to them, or… 

01:15:50
KEVIN I tried it nothing about it… 

01:15:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:15:55
KEVIN And I tried to ignore them umm, and really find ways to accept myself or get myself focused on, on what I'm doing instead of really indulging in, in my failures… 

01:16:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:16:05
KEVIN …or what I want to be. 

01:16:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay. So you'd been working hard trying not to feel, what you've been feeling. 

01:16:15
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:16:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Ah, but it sounds like it's getting more difficult for you not to feel it. 

01:16:20
KEVIN Correct. 

01:16:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay. Umm, Kevin were you raise within any particular religious or spiritual orientation?

01:16:45
KEVIN Correct. 

01:16:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. Umm… How do you use your spirituality or your religious beliefs to help you, ah cope with the difficulties or transitions like that one you are experiencing now. 

01:16:55
KEVIN I believe if I like the strength, umm, in you know the bible… 

01:17:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:17:00
KEVIN …and really encouragement and also like a sense of relief, Umm… through speaking you know, with other people in the church as well as, you know praying… 

01:17:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:17:10
KEVIN …about the, the things that are not going my way. 

01:17:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:17:15
KEVIN I guess. 

01:17:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm… okay, and you find that as a strength for yourself. 

01:17:20
KEVIN Correct. 

01:17:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, and so you've been obviously going to church and doing some of the spiritual practice, religious practices… 

01:17:25
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:17:25
KAROLYN SENTOR …that have helped, that help you umm…, so far. 

01:17:30
KEVIN Correct. 

01:17:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Correct, okay, okay. Alright, umm, can you tell me a little bit umm, more about like your upbringing, like was it pretty, I know the normals not necessarily… 

01:17:40
KEVIN Traditional? 

01:17:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah, traditional, you got that yeah. 

01:17:45
KEVIN My, my mom, and dad are pretty traditional. 

01:17:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:17:45
KEVIN They are you know, from China so… 

01:17:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:17:50
KEVIN …this is a stereotype but, Asian parents are usually very strict umm, and academias looked upon as… as number one… 

01:17:55
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:18:00
KEVIN …ah, priority. Umm…, but I, I see as, ah, the really want the best for you, and anything less than that is, is not acceptable. 

01:18:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay. Would you say you are agreed with the traditions of your, your parents and your background. 

01:18:15
KEVIN Yeah, at that time, I don't like it, but now I see that, it will helped me to, to, to grow… 

01:18:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:18:20
KEVIN …ah, and to become more matured at this point. 

01:18:25
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm…hmm, hmm… hmm… Okay, okay. Ah, is there anything else you think is important for me to know about your family background and history that I haven't asked? 

01:18:35
KEVIN No, I think, that's… that's about it. 

01:18:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay. Now Kevin, umm, I'm wondering if ah, when things had been the absolute worse for you, if you have ever had any kind of thoughts of self harm, suicidal ideation or anything like that? 

01:18:50
KEVIN No, as usually just, what I go on vacation… 

01:18:55
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:18:55
KEVIN …and really just a, a sense of getting away from, from the stress and the busyness and everything being so boisterous. So, not the sense of that, you know the, the dire(ph) need of depression or even close to the suicide, but more of it. I need to get away. 

01:19:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Oh, okay. 

01:19:15
KEVIN Feeling. 

01:19:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay, and that's how you're feeling now like in the workplace. 

01:19:20
KEVIN Correct. 

01:19:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:19:20
KEVIN I, I need to, to get away or, or find a way to, to correct the, the things I'm feeling now before, it gets any worse. 

01:19:25
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm… Well, it kinda sounds like you've been focusing on some solutions for yourself. Is it possible to get away, ah, in a workplace at this point. 

01:19:35
KEVIN Yeah, I, I, I'm planning to take, you know couple of weekends and fly back to Florida and see my family. 

01:19:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:19:40
KEVIN Ah, maybe its home sickness… 

01:19:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:19:45
KEVIN …Umm, but I believe that'll, will relax, relax me a little bit more. 

01:19:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay, alright. And umm… I'm wondering Kevin, if ah, when you decided to make this appointment, if you had any kind of ideas about how you felt counseling could help you specifically? 

01:20:05
KEVIN Yeah, I just wanted some guidance in some direction on maybe it's my thought process and maybe it's the Umm…, habitual nature of, of my daily activities, umm…, that is causing me to umm…, I guess tire myself or it really make myself in a, in a low mood… 

01:20:25
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:20:25
KEVIN …situation instead of umm…, you know taking risk and challenge myself to become more alert. 

01:20:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay. So you mentioned something about your thought processes, umm…, tell me what type of thoughts have you been having that you think are contributing to your emotional experience at work and at home? 

01:20:45
KEVIN Well, my upbringing in the church and, and the values my mom and dad have spoken to me, it's really to, to love and be humble and… 

01:20:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:20:55
KEVIN …and, to cherish other people. 

01:20:55
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:20:55
KEVIN Umm, but sometime I feel like, I work umm…, these values aren't being promoted. 

01:21:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:21:00
KEVIN But they opposite it, umm…, and that kinda bothers me, and umm… it's harder for me to, to love and, and be compassionate to those who aren't compassionate to others. 

01:21:15
KAROLYN SENTOR I see, I see. Now, have you had any experience, where you felt personally, umm…, offended, or ah, you know attacked maybe too strong of a word, but, ah where, where it made… made it very difficult for you to love in, in the workplace. 

01:21:35
KEVIN Well, umm… personally, I don't kind of, join in their conversation, but I can't listen and say well, I, I give my two sense and say well. 

01:21:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:21:45
KEVIN There should be some passion with those, umm…, statements you made and, and really more of a open up view to the things, but ah, other than that I really don't get too deep into it because, I am afraid of criticism… 

01:22:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Oh. 

01:22:00
KEVIN …Umm…, in a large setting. 

01:22:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm… Okay, so it's kind of difficult for you to really express, how you feel in that setting… 

01:22:10
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:22:10
KAROLYN SENTOR …ah, for fear of how they're gonna respond. 

01:22:10
KEVIN Correct. 

01:22:10
KAROLYN SENTOR But, there is a lot, it sounds like there is a lot you don't agree with and how to treat other people… 

01:22:15
KEVIN Correct. 

01:22:20
KAROLYN SENTOR …and each other. 

01:22:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay. So, ah, there is some a (inaudible ) with what you believe ah, about loving and being compassionate toward people and what's you're actually experiencing with your co-workers at work. 

01:22:30
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:22:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, and that's difficult for you to kinda, reconcile. 

01:22:35
KEVIN Hmm… hmm… I had to remember, I guess I put a standard there that everybody should be such a way, you know. 

01:22:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:22:40
KEVIN And in reality, that's not always the case. 

01:22:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay, okay. And, and Kevin you also mentioned something about like, umm…, habitual practices that maybe contributing… 

01:22:55
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:22:55
KAROLYN SENTOR …to how you are feeling now and can you tell me more about that? 

01:22:55
KEVIN It's more like a, it's like day job every day, I wake up at 6:30, you know eat breakfast, go work, stay at work till six. 

01:23:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:23:05
KEVIN Umm…, go home, cook dinner and clean, and then shower and go to sleep and then ready for the next day. 

01:23:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:23:15
KEVIN And it's more like a, am I doing this umm…, because I want to… 

01:23:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:23:20
KEVIN …or is it just because I'm, I'm dragging my feet or really to find that balance of, of really what I want to do. 

01:23:25
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:23:25
KEVIN Am I doing it with the right mind… 

01:23:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:23:30
KEVIN …and right focus. 

01:23:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm… and when you say doing it, is it umm… doing… 

01:23:35
KEVIN Like working and… 

01:23:35
KAROLYN SENTOR …okay. 

01:23:40
KEVIN …just and my selling (inaudible ) just staying at home or could I be more social, move outside… 

01:23:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Oh, I see. 

01:23:45
KEVIN …with that setting or umm… yeah. 

01:23:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay. So questioning umm… if there could be some kind of difference in your routine… 

01:23:55
KEVIN Correct. 

01:24:00
KAROLYN SENTOR …that might help you feel better. 

01:24:00
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:24:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. Do you have any kind of fears about giving out, doing more. 

01:24:05
KEVIN Of course, I've only been here for six months… 

01:24:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:24:10
KEVIN …so, I don't really know the area per se (inaudible ) on the people. 

01:24:13
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:24:15
KEVIN And I think trust is, is slowly… 

01:24:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:24:15
KEVIN …getting umm…, earned. 

01:24:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:24:20
KEVIN But also a fear of rejection is always there and a fear of, of not being ah, able to, to adapt to the surroundings. 

01:24:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. So, if you felt more comfortable, what kind of things would you ah, engage at. 

01:24:35
KEVIN Umm… probably going to like movies with other people. 

01:24:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Umm… 

01:24:40
KEVIN Umm… going to museums, umm, something that's more I guess, active than staying at home. 

01:24:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh…Huh… Uh…Huh… 

01:24:50
KEVIN Umm, and I think, if I were back in the south, I would do a lot more extracurricular activities with friends of mine. 

01:24:55
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, so it sounds like, doing more things, but also doing them with the people that you enjoy being with? 

01:25:00
KEVIN Correct. 

01:25:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, and that has a lot to do with you meeting new people here. 

01:25:05
KEVIN Correct. 

01:25:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay. So Kevin I noticed that you mentioned that you were first generation college student. 

01:25:15
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:25:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Can you tell me what that experience has been like for you, ah, in your family? 

01:25:20
KEVIN Umm, well my parents work a lot in local retail business and so I would go home, as, as early childhood I would go home on a bike or go to school bike you know, a lot of the… the homework is, is done by, by me. 

01:25:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:25:35
KEVIN Umm, and, and the standard is, is very strict like, you've to get studies(ph), that's like the goal and there is no other go. 

01:25:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm… okay. 

01:25:45
KEVIN Umm, and that continued through college, ah, through high school and the college, umm…, and there wasn't, there were support, they(ph) are from my parents, but not physical. 

01:25:55
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:25:55
KEVIN They would say, if you need help, you can hire somebody or… 

01:25:55
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:26:00
KEVIN …or ah, so forth, umm, but I felt like, I had an opportunity that they didn't have. 

01:26:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:26:05
KEVIN Umm, I was blessed and, and really, honored with this opportunity that they never had the chance for. 

01:26:10

01:26:15
KEVIN They would tell me stories about how they grew up… 

01:26:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:26:15
KEVIN …in a, you know (inaudible ) country. 

01:26:18
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:26:20
KEVIN …Umm…, so for me to say, umm…, anything to, to oppose and, and dishonor them would be absurd. 

01:26:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Umm… Okay. 

01:26:30
KEVIN And I really feel like I had to excel, like this opportunity was, one in a lifetime chance. 

01:26:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay. So it sounds like the expectations are really high for you. 

01:26:40
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:26:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Ah, and your family is very proud of you, but also expect a lot. 

01:26:45
KEVIN Yeah, and I think a lot of it is do they don't want me to live the life that they did. 

01:26:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:26:50
KEVIN And they've worked so hard, 12 hour a day, six days a week, and one day off… 

01:26:55
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:26:55
KEVIN …it's, it's, it's a life they never want me to have. 

01:27:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:27:00
KEVIN And so to understand, how hard they worked and they just give back with doing well in the school is, is I think… 

01:27:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:27:10
KEVIN …I wouldn't have bargain(ph). 

01:27:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm… hmm… hmm… Yeah. You know something, kinda strikes me about that with regards to the pressure you must feel to succeed, ah, and obviously you did well in school, and ah, but I'm wondering does that transfer to the work place. Is there any pressure to succeed there. 

01:27:25
KEVIN Yeah. Umm… most definitely especially because I'm, I'm a new guy. 

01:27:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:27:30
KEVIN And everybody else has been there, they've either you know moved there from a couple of years or they've grown up in St. Louis. I on the other hand that never been here. 

01:27:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:27:40
KEVIN Umm…, there is a, a sense of I need to prove myself… 

01:27:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Umm… 

01:27:45
KEVIN Umm…, and I have been putting a lot of effort into work ethic, and I've really been trying to show the, the you know, my supervisors… 

01:27:55
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:27:55
KEVIN …that I, that I'm able to work at a very high level. 

01:28:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay. Do you think that umm…, that you need to prove yourself in the workplace, might be contributing to some of the symptoms that you're experiencing now? 

01:28:10
KEVIN Yes, yes, I, I think that really crossed my mind, that I'm working so hard to, to impress… 

01:28:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:28:20
KEVIN …and to, to make a reputation for myself. 

01:28:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:28:25
KEVIN Umm… And I think that, that has a lot to do with, the, the training, in fact that I feel now. 

01:28:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm… hmm… hmm… If you were to participate in counseling and it was a successful experience for you, how would your life look different. 

01:28:45
KEVIN Umm… 

01:28:45
KAROLYN SENTOR What would change for you? 

01:28:50
KEVIN I think, my social life… 

01:28:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:28:50
KEVIN …umm, the way I interact with others… 

01:28:55
KAROLYN SENTOR Umm… 

01:28:55
KEVIN …umm, may be even the, the habits, I do daily. 

01:29:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:29:00
KEVIN Umm… And also my perspective would change hopefully through counseling… 

01:29:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:29:05
KEVIN …ah, to guide me, to do one thing or another. 

01:29:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm… So does that translate into you could have more friends, ah… 

01:29:15
KEVIN Ah, maybe not so much more… 

01:29:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:29:15
KEVIN …but the quality of friendship. 

01:29:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. So the quality of friendships would be improved, and your habits, your routine would change. 

01:29:25
KEVIN Correct. 

01:29:25
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, and that would include more of… 

01:29:30
KEVIN Ah, either doing other things that don't just involve myself. 

01:29:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:29:35
KEVIN Umm…, or even if it does involve just myself, that I would be more… 

01:29:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:29:40
KEVIN Umm…sociable… 

01:29:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:29:45
KEVIN …in my approach. 

01:29:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. So does that mean, ah reaching out to others. 

01:29:50
KEVIN Hmm… hmm… coz I feel like the sense of umm…, there is like a barrier between, like me and the people… 

01:29:55
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:30:00
KEVIN …right now. 

01:30:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:30:00
KEVIN Umm, especially what I'm trying to get settled… 

01:30:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Umm… 

01:30:05
KEVIN …in a place I, I'm very unfamiliar with. 

01:30:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm… Umm, it sounds like, it will also ah, include some kind of risk taking on your part. Umm… I know you talked about the fear of rejection and could that possibly be one of the barriers. 

01:30:15
KEVIN Yes. 

01:30:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:30:20
KEVIN Umm… I've had so little of it that when it does happen, it, it's hard. 

01:30:25
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:30:25
KEVIN So then, that's would makes it even more of a sensitive and delicate subject. 

01:30:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. So it's kind of sounds like this is a new territory for you, you are not really used to be in this position, where you don't have the support of family and friends and lots of activities and just being happy and enjoying yourself. 

01:30:40
KEVIN Correct. 

01:30:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay, and so really it's about getting adjusted and learning new ways to umm…, navigate… 

01:30:50
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:30:50
KAROLYN SENTOR …this new experience. 

01:30:50
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:30:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, umm, is there anything else do you think is important for me to know or that you would like to add before I share my impressions and thoughts about how counseling may be helpful? 

01:31:05
KEVIN Yeah, I just basically its sums(ph) up as, I really wanna do stuff and I really wanna reach(ph) and be busy and I really wanna serve and stuff like that but I feel like I don't know how… 

01:31:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:31:15
KEVIN …or where to start. 

01:31:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay. 

01:31:20
KEVIN And because I don't know how or where to start I feel like I, I settle for not doing anything at all. 

01:31:25
KAROLYN SENTOR I see. I see. And that's understandable too. I think a lot of times when we're missing that how to part umm… we just don't do anything or umm… so and I think counseling could be a really good vehicle for you to explore some of the how to steps ahh, putting yourself more out there umm… taking more risk, exploring different options of connecting with people. Umm… so I think that umm… I would definitely recommend that you consider coming back and participating in more counseling session… sessions to help you process all of this. What's your thoughts about that about coming back to counseling? 

01:32:05
KEVIN Umm… I think this session went really well. 

01:32:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:32:05
KEVIN Umm… I was very-very hesitant at first. 

01:32:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:32:10
KEVIN Because talking to strangers is umm… not really our style, I guess… 

01:32:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:32:15
KEVIN …my style. Ahh… and I'm really close to my mom… 

01:32:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:32:20
KEVIN So its new, but I believe you know, there's… there's always help. 

01:32:25
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm, hmm… hmm… Now, when you say umm (inaudible ) talking with others just not our style, are you saying that it's not part of your cultural context ahh? 

01:32:35
KEVIN Yeah, I believe like ahh… that I'm speaking on my experience at Asian, people of Asian descent are very reserved. 

01:32:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:32:45
KEVIN Uh even though the things are not looking right, they don't complaint they just kind of… 

01:32:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:32:50
KEVIN …keep hard at it. 

01:32:55
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:32:55
KEVIN And you know, wait for that light at end of the tunnel. 

01:32:55
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm, hmm… hmm… yeah, well I think it takes a lot of courage to kind of step outside of that and ahh… explore something new and I think this is a good example of you taking a risk and exploring something new ahh… that could possibly help you so I wanna commend you on taking … 

01:33:15
KEVIN Thank you. 

01:33:15
KAROLYN SENTOR …that first step. Yeah. Okay ahh I, my impressions of your situation are that umm… a lot of this is very situational that again this is new territory perhaps even new emotional territory for you, umm… not used to experiencing these feeling and… ah, and then not really knowing how to make things different for yourself and I think counseling again could be really helpful. And I don't foresee you having to participate in a lot of sessions ahh, you seem to be pretty high functioning and very honest and umm… real open to self-examination and those are some really good qualities and strengths to have in this process. So I ahh… I don't think it should take that long, but I was wondering if you had any ideas of how many sessions you ahh… would participate in umm… that you would be comfortable participating in. 

01:34:10
KEVIN Umm… I actually didn't come here with a number. 

01:34:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:34:15
KEVIN Umm… but I… I really wanted umm… to seek professional help. 

01:34:20
KAROLYN SENTOR I see. 

01:34:20
KEVIN Uh, I've talked to pastors and I've spoken with my pastor and counselors before, umm… but I, I really wanted to… to take another step… 

01:34:25
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:34:25
KEVIN …and see how I can be helped professionally. 

01:34:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:34:30
KEVIN And see what views or what, what different approaches that are used to help me… 

01:34:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:34:35
KEVIN …to, to find another umm… I guess answer… 

01:34:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm, hmm… hmm… okay, okay. And one final thing I wanted to ask Kevin uh, because I'm thinking about in the interim between this session and the time when you come back umm… things that you might focus on and I'm wondering what do you consider as your strengths umm… that might be helpful for you as you work on things in between sessions? 

01:35:00
KEVIN Umm… I think I'm very open. 

01:35:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:35:05
KEVIN Umm… I'm open at talking to people. 

01:35:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:35:05
KEVIN I'm open to meet new people… 

01:35:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:35:10
KEVIN And I'm actually enjoy doing anything. I'm very adaptable. 

01:35:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:35:10
KEVIN Umm… may be, you know just hanging out, umm… playing cards pool. 

01:35:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:35:20
KEVIN I'm very open. 

01:35:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm… okay and so that's the strength for you in terms of connecting with other people? 

01:35:25
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:35:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay… Okay. Any other strengths that you think you have that might be umm… called upon at this point? 

01:35:35
KEVIN Umm… in particular to… 

01:35:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Just to improve in the quality of your life and… 

01:35:40
KEVIN Ahh, I think I can rearrange my schedule… 

01:35:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:35:45
KEVIN To… to really make an… make an effort to… 

01:35:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:35:45
KEVIN …change umm… just this low emotional level now. 

01:35:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:35:50
KEVIN And I… I'm really, I really strive to, to change it because it's bothering me, umm… maybe not others around me… 

01:36:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:36:00
KEVIN But personally it affects me. 

01:36:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. So it sounds like you're flexible? 

01:36:05
KEVIN Yeah. 

01:36:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay, okay, okay. Well, I think those are some really great things to umm… use in this process umm… now and ahh, I would encourage you to kind of focus on your strengths and do those things that will help you feel better and umm… when you come back we would talk more about umm… well before I assume that you're gonna come back umm… are you comfortable returning to see me? 

01:36:30
KEVIN I'm definitely ahh… very comfortable. 

01:36:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:36:35
KEVIN Umm… this conversation has gone very well. 

01:36:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay… 

01:36:40
KEVIN And beyond my expectation. 

01:36:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. Okay very good. Well, I'm gonna recommend that you come back and see me and we'll continue to work on more specific how to steps and building on the strengths that you identified, okay. 

01:36:50
KEVIN Okay. 

01:36:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. Any other questions… 

01:36:50
KEVIN No. 

01:36:55
KAROLYN SENTOR …before we close? Okay, thank you. Alright. 

01:37:00
De-Briefing of Session two with Dr. Sentor, Kevin, and Dr. Woodsmall 

01:37:05
CRAIG WOODSMALL Okay, Kevin and Karolyn now… talk a little bit about the interview that you just completed. 

01:37:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. 

01:37:10
CRAIG WOODSMALL And umm… just start us off I'd like to hear from… from you first Kevin of what the interview was like for you? 

01:37:20
KEVIN I think it was, it went very well. She is very open, umm… very considered, and she didn't pride(ph) umm… she didn't like forcefully make me give an answer, she just wanted to know what I wanted to share. 

01:37:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:37:35
KEVIN And she accepted that. 

01:37:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL Good. So it's nice not to have to answer any questions that felt too intrusive? 

01:37:40
KEVIN Correct. 

01:37:40
CRAIG WOODSMALL Great. All right. And for you Karolyn umm… what went well? 

01:37:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Umm… I think what went well, umm… was the flow of the conversation and umm… getting more information about his experience umm… at work. I was trying to find out what specifically was bothering him about that. 

01:38:05
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:38:05
KAROLYN SENTOR And I think I got a lot of information umm… that help me understand what was really going on with him. 

01:38:10
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah, absolutely that is an important part of the intake counseling process is the, the process of not just gathering information but beginning to think… 

01:38:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:38:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL …from the counselor's perspective how that information might ah, relate to one another what the, the patterns might be and one of the things that may be beginning counselors often struggle with… 

01:38:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:38:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL Is making premature umm… hypothesis about what might be umm… happening with the client. 

01:38:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:38:45
CRAIG WOODSMALL How do you go about preventing yourself from drawing those premature conclusions. 

01:38:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Umm… that's a yeah, that's a really good question, because umm… something you always have to think about it's not just as clear as they initially state and so I think by asking a lot of questions asking for examples… 

01:39:05
CRAIG WOODSMALL Umm. 

01:39:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Umm… asking more questions asking more examples you kinda get more of the information and that takes you away from problem solving. 

01:39:10
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:39:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Umm… there is just so much that about his story that I… I didn't get and there is so much more… 

01:39:20
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:39:20
KAROLYN SENTOR …that I can know. Ahh… so that kinda helped me just recognizing… 

01:39:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:39:25
KAROLYN SENTOR …that I don't know everything and there were more questions that I could ask him. 

01:39:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right, so part of it is really just an attitude that you can't understand everything so quickly. 

01:39:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Right. 

01:39:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL And that even if in Kevin's case you know, that he was ah… reporting to you things so clearly and, and so well it might make it seem like you could move into problem solving. 

01:39:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:39:45
CRAIG WOODSMALL But you prevent yourself from, form doing that. 

01:39:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Exactly. 

01:39:50
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah, very good. Umm… Kevin I was wondering at, at the very beginning ah, Karolyn spent a lot of time talking to you about what to expect ah, in your meeting with her and kind of laying the groundwork for what you're going to be doing. How helpful was that for you, given that you had never met with a professional counselor? 

01:40:10
KEVIN Umm… it kinda prepared me, it's like go into a first job, the first day you're going to the class… 

01:40:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:40:20
KEVIN …the first day that you like the service(ph) and I really like that that give me what to expect and when am I gonna get out of this or… 

01:40:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:40:25
KEVIN …you know what am I… what am I coming to… 

01:40:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:40:25
KEVIN What is… what is gonna be done here and that really allowed me to really say, well do I want this or do I not want this? And… 

01:40:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL Hmm… yeah. So in a way it helped you focused on kind of more what you're going to say, because you got to a point where you're more comfortable? 

01:40:40
KEVIN Correct. 

01:40:40
CRAIG WOODSMALL Okay, all right. And Karolyn is that something you… you do for all clients or do you always make it a kind of a point to ask umm… someone that you're meeting with for the first time whether or not they'd been in counseling? 

01:40:55
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah, it's something I do with clients, who've never been in counseling before, I think it's really important to kind of prepare them and let them know what they can expect from the process and sometimes ahh… I'll ask umm, the question if client who've been in counseling before too… 

01:41:10
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:41:10
KAROLYN SENTOR …because they might not know what to expect from me. So… 

01:41:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:41:15
KAROLYN SENTOR …umm, and just try… it, it helps put them at ease. 

01:41:20
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah, good yeah. I also noticed that before you really began the assessment part… 

01:41:25
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:41:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL …ahh you had asked Kevin ah, whether or not he had any concerns about some of the more obvious differences between the two of you… 

01:41:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:41:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL And I was wondering if you can talk about… ahh (inaudible ) for that. 

01:41:37
KAROLYN SENTOR Okay. Umm… well, I know a lot of times ahh… clients are assigned counselors randomly and umm… so they don't really have any say about who they're gonna see… 

01:41:45
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:41:50
KAROLYN SENTOR …and they may have some preferences of going into the process that maybe doesn't get addressed when they make any appointment. So ahh… when there is obvious even when there are similarities too, coz you can never assume that… 

01:42:00
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:42:00
KAROLYN SENTOR …you have the same experience with somebody, who from the same culture from but umm… you know, I think it's just important to kind of point out that obvious ah, difference… 

01:42:10
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:42:10
KAROLYN SENTOR …in the beginning to see if maybe they would prefer working with the male or ah, somebody who was the older or younger. 

01:42:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:42:20
KAROLYN SENTOR And then I could actually talk about that and maybe help them feel at ease. So that could be a possibility later on. 

01:42:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL Hmm… right so just, I noticed Kevin that your response was essentially that you're okay. That that you didn't have any concerns about that. 

01:42:30
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:42:30
CRAIG WOODSMALL But it almost seemed like Karolyn like you… part of asking or bringing that up was to open the door for exploring those areas later in the session. 

01:42:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Right. Yes. 

01:42:40
CRAIG WOODSMALL Very Good. Umm… when we get to, umm… you know, talk a little bit about your concerns that you brought in ahh, in thinking about the… the information you were able to share with Karolyn, how well do you feel like you're able to kind of articulate your concerns to her? 

01:43:00
KEVIN I think, she asked like questions that were pinpoint… 

01:43:00
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:43:05
KEVIN …that that maybe I didn't go over that completely or she just asked a question that make sure she got… 

01:43:10
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:43:10
KEVIN Ahh… what was needed… 

01:43:10
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:43:10
KEVIN …completely and I think it was very accurate ahh… 

01:43:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:43:15
KEVIN …and she allowed me to share everything that I was feeling. At the same time being considered of why I didn't want to share. 

01:43:20
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right, right, so it sounds like ahh… it felt to you like she was very much on target ahh… with what was important to you and if things weren't umm… clear she even would follow up and… 

01:43:30
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:43:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL …ask clarifying questions… Okay, very good. And Karolyn as, as the interview was going along, how clear was it to you ah, what was important to Kevin like what was primary? 

01:43:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Umm… I think what became clear was his umm… connection to people umm… that was very important to him and that was something that he was really missing and being away from his family, but also from his friends and umm social support was umm… making things a little bit more difficult for him, but that's one of the things that I kinda jumped out at me… 

01:44:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:44:15
KAROLYN SENTOR …as being very important to him. 

01:44:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah, absolutely. 

01:44:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:44:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL It did umm… kind of unfold… 

01:44:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:44:20
CRAIG WOODSMALL …that over the course, umm… 

01:44:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:44:20
CRAIG WOODSMALL …that that was a primary focus of what… your concerns were. 

01:44:25
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:44:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL And given that it… it had a lot of difference sides to it. It was you know, something that affected your work… 

01:44:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:44:30
CRAIG WOODSMALL …and it had to do with umm… you know, a lots of changes and transitions happening in your life. 

01:44:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:44:40
CRAIG WOODSMALL Umm, I was wondering Karolyn how in… in conducting the interview, how you know where to go next? Given that there were so many different sides to Kevin's story? 

01:44:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah. umm… yeah, that that's can be tough sometimes, I think with Kevin I just kinda tried to follow his lead and umm… and then almost think about whenever he raised an issue think what else is there… what else can I ask about that situation. And that kinda like served as my guide. 

01:45:10
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. So that was something that you always kind of kept in the… in the back of your mind… 

01:45:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:45:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL …to help guide you to… 

01:45:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:45:20
CRAIG WOODSMALL …where to go next. 

01:45:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm… yeah 

01:45:20
CRAIG WOODSMALL Always wondering what else… 

01:45:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm… what else could there be… 

01:45:20
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:45:25
KAROLYN SENTOR Umm… and then you know, there were some general areas that I wanted to touch upon… 

01:45:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:45:25
KAROLYN SENTOR …and that you know, served as a guide as well but umm… within those areas whatever he brought up I was thinking what more can I know about this? 

01:45:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right, alright. Kevin were there any things that you didn't get to umm… share with Karolyn during that were important to you that you're hoping to be able to talk? 

01:45:45
KEVIN No, I think umm… she asked those questions generally, very specifically like what else would you like to share and I believe I had umm… generally all the… all the obstacles I go… 

01:45:55
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:45:55
…on a weekly or daily basis that really bothered me or changed me. 

01:46:00
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. Okay, good Okay. And for you Karolyn was there… is there anything that you would have done differently or something that you would have wanted to ah, improve on? 

01:46:10
KAROLYN SENTOR I think one of the things that I neglected to do in the beginning of the session was spend a little bit more time… well, actually I didn't talk about it but I wish I would have talked more about confidentiality because… 

01:46:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:46:25
KAROLYN SENTOR …he had indicated that this was his first time in counseling… 

01:46:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:46:30
KAROLYN SENTOR And there was some discomfort and I think it's important to let clients know umm… about confidentiality in the limits coz I think that can help make them feel more at ease as well to know that it's not gonna go umm… outside of the counseling sessions with the exception of the limits. 

01:46:45
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right, right so that's a very important thing… 

01:46:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:46:50
CRAIG WOODSMALL …ah, for beginning counselors to here again… 

01:46:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:46:50
CRAIG WOODSMALL …is, is that it is umm… necessary to go over that verbally in great detail… 

01:46:55
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah. 

01:47:00
CRAIG WOODSMALL …with every client, so that they know ah, that what they share with their counselor… 

01:47:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:47:05
CRAIG WOODSMALL …is protected by law. 

01:47:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah 

01:47:05
CRAIG WOODSMALL And that reminds me of… of something that I found myself thinking, so I watched umm… your work with Kevin… 

01:47:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:47:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Is umm… that the contrast in your style ah, versus the previous demonstration with Dr. Beam. 

01:47:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:47:20
CRAIG WOODSMALL I noticed that umm… in comparison to him you seem to be more structured. 

01:47:25
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:47:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL You had specific areas that umm… at least it felt to me that were umm… standard to you to ask about… 

01:47:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah. 

01:47:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL …with every client, whereas his style was more just a free flowing… 

01:47:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah. 

01:47:40
CRAIG WOODSMALL …the kinda follow wherever client wants to go. Is that something that is just a personal style or do you umm… feel like there is advantages and disadvantages? 

01:47:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah, I think both its… it's a personal style and I think they are definite advantages for me and my work too kinda get the same information from clients in the intake… ah, whenever possible. But I do also realize that there are times when clients will need more time to focus on something… 

01:48:10
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:48:10
KAROLYN SENTOR That's really important to them and I will always let that take precedence ah, over my need for, you know… 

01:48:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:48:15
KAROLYN SENTOR …this you know, structured information and stuff. 

01:48:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. So, so really that means that your approach to conducting first intake is semi-structured. 

01:48:25
KAROLYN SENTOR Right. 

01:48:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL Rather than it being you know, you know fully structured and… and you ask the same questions of every client in the same order, this is… had(ph) some flexibility too. 

01:48:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Absolutely, yeah. 

01:48:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL Very good. Ah… Kevin there were couple of points ah, during ah… the intake what you were talking about some of the changes that had been happening you noticed in yourself both at work and at home, umm… at any point did it feel to you like umm… the way in which Karolyn was responding to that was I guess over umm… exaggerating. Umm… a technical word would be pathologizing and kind of exaggerating the extent or severe umm… severity of… of your problems. 

01:49:15
KEVIN No, I didn't… I didn't feel like she was, she was making it umm… worse than it was… 

01:49:20
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:49:20
KEVIN But she wanted to know how bad it was and I feel like that made it seem like she cared even more for my safety. 

01:49:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right, right. 

01:49:30
KEVIN Umm… to, to see where how deep it really was. How serious it was, to me, made me feel like she really cares. 

01:49:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:49:35
KEVIN She's… she's wanting to help. 

01:49:40
CRAIG WOODSMALL That that's a really important difference between wanting to know how bad things can get versus umm… kind of maybe umm… misunderstanding what you're saying and or having the impression that things were much worse than they really are. 

01:49:55
KEVIN Correct. 

01:49:55
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah, good is that something that ah, you're mindful of? 

01:50:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm… Well, you know, I realized at times that I may have even ask, asked this similar questions umm… about what was going at, going on at work and it's good to hear him say that he didn't experience it has been you know, umm… pathologizing in any kind of way, because I was kind of aware of that, but I was thinking he was a young man, who umm… counseling is not a part of his cultural context and he's going beyond that… 

01:50:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:50:25
KAROLYN SENTOR …to seek help for himself nobody recommended that he come. 

01:50:30
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:50:30
KAROLYN SENTOR That there was something serious enough for him to take that step. 

01:50:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:50:35
KAROLYN SENTOR So, I wanted to ask more questions and I, you know and I wanted to ask him in different kind of ways to see if there was more information I could obtain. So, but I was mindful of that, that. 

01:50:45
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah, that was very clear 

01:50:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:50:45
CRAIG WOODSMALL Very good. Umm… Towards the ahh… end of, of your ahh, intake with her… with Kevin umm… I noticed that umm… at one point you made a direct comment about his facial expression. 

01:51:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:51:05
CRAIG WOODSMALL And umm… beginning counselors might have some questions about umm… whether or not it's okay to draw attention to how the client is umm… reacting in session. 

01:51:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:51:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL And I was wondering if you could kind of explain your thinking there. 

01:51:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah. Umm… well I, I like to use the immediacy of the situation a lot of times, umm… because we're listening for more than just words, umm… we're listening for changes and expressions body language and things like that so when in noticed something that is is, umm… as ahh, distinct as a smile…. 

01:51:40
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:51:40
KAROLYN SENTOR …when somebody was talking about something or maybe a frown. I like to comment on it to let… to let the client be aware that if, if they're not. 

01:51:50
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:51:50
KAROLYN SENTOR But just to point out that this might mean something… 

01:51:55
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:51:55
KAROLYN SENTOR …and ah… 

01:51:55
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right, so part of it is… is to draw the client's attention to it and make sure that they're aware it. 

01:52:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Right, right. 

01:52:00
CRAIG WOODSMALL But also its… it's to show that you're paying attention and you noticed… 

01:52:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah. 

01:52:00
CRAIG WOODSMALL …something important just happened. 

01:52:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah. 

01:52:05
CRAIG WOODSMALL Okay. What was it like Kevin, when she umm… you know, drew attention the fact that your face lit up? 

01:52:10
KEVIN At first I didn't really noticed and then she mentioned, I said, "Oh, yeah," it… it did lit up… 

01:52:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL It did… yeah. 

01:52:15
KEVIN …and, and that kinda of just reassure that me (inaudible ) how genuine, umm… really my focus is. 

01:52:20
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah, very good. Umm… soon after that Karolyn there were… there were few other points, where Umm… it seemed like you made a very slight shift from gathering information to starting to kinda provide some feedbacks some information back to Kevin. 

01:52:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:52:40
CRAIG WOODSMALL And I wanted to go over a few other things that you had said umm… umm… the first thing was that umm… umm… see if I can find it here in my notes. Umm… you talked about how he umm… would like to socialize more and asked him at various points that… that you know, what could he do or what would look different… 

01:53:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:53:10
CRAIG WOODSMALL …as a result of that. 

01:53:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:53:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL What were you hoping to… to accomplish that? 

01:53:20
KAROLYN SENTOR There I was hoping to begin the process of goal setting from his perspective umm… if he could share with me what he… how he could vision his life differently… 

01:53:30
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:53:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Then that was gonna give me some clues about goal setting. Because if he's saying oh, I'll be going out more… 

01:53:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL Hmm. 

01:53:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… I'd be happy here then, then I use that to kinda help with the goal setting. 

01:53:40
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:53:40
KAROLYN SENTOR But it just kinda gets the information from his perspective. 

01:53:45
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. Soon after that I noticed too that you asked Kevin about strengths. 

01:53:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:53:50
CRAIG WOODSMALL Ah, what role does assessing for a client's strengths play during an intake? 

01:53:55
KAROLYN SENTOR Well, I think ah, it serves as a reminder to the client that they do have things working for them. 

01:54:00
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:54:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Sometimes they forget ah… when they're experiencing distress. Ah… the other thing is I, I'm aware that as much as I would like for Kevin to return for another session, this might be the only chance I have with him. So… 

01:54:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:54:15
KAROLYN SENTOR …I wanted to leave him with something hopeful and positive that he could remember and perhaps drawn(ph) 

01:54:20
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right… right. As most counselors know that the model number of… of ah, visits for majority of clients is, is one. 

01:54:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Right. 

01:54:30
CRAIG WOODSMALL And sometimes that's our only ah, opportunity to affect change. 

01:54:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Right. 

01:54:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL So you were aware of that, but you're also ah, I think put very, very nicely how it's important to have a balance between looking at what's not working and… and still recognizing what is going on. 

01:54:45
KAROLYN SENTOR Right, yeah. 

01:54:45
CRAIG WOODSMALL Okay. You took those strengths Karolyn and gave Kevin some homework… 

01:54:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:54:50
CRAIG WOODSMALL …to do. And I wanted to talk about that because again counselors might have different opinions about, ah giving clients homework after a first session. 

01:55:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:55:00
CRAIG WOODSMALL Ah… what are your thoughts about that? 

01:55:00
KAROLYN SENTOR I again, I think it's in line with ah, maybe not getting more than one opportunity with the client ah, wanting them to think about ways that they can start making changes in their lives to improve the quality. 

01:55:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:55:15
KAROLYN SENTOR So, I do kinda think about homework for most of my clients. 

01:55:20
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:55:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Ah, there is something to think about ah… doing differently… 

01:55:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:55:25
KAROLYN SENTOR …between sessions or if they never come back this is something they could take with them. 

01:55:30
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:55:30
KAROLYN SENTOR And practice on their own. 

01:55:30
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. Okay. Is it… if I can follow up is there ever a situation or a particular type of… of client ah, where you wouldn't give homework right away. 

01:55:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Oh, I'm sure yeah. Ah… I would probably hesitate to give someone homework, who demonstrates a resistance to the process. 

01:55:50
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:55:50
KAROLYN SENTOR And perhaps somebody, who is still trying to figure out what the issue is… 

01:55:55
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:56:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Ah, I wouldn't be too inclined to tell them go home and do this. 

01:56:00
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

01:56:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Because… 

01:56:00
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:56:05
KAROLYN SENTOR There would be more information to gather. 

01:56:05
CRAIG WOODSMALL And makes sense… 

01:56:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:56:05
CRAIG WOODSMALL …but in your case Kevin was pretty clear that you were, ah not just motivated to try out those things, but ahh… had a good idea already of… of some things that you might be able to do differently. 

01:56:20
KEVIN Uh… huh… 

01:56:20
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah, very good. Well, I think that's about it. I wanna… I wanna thank you both again for doing a great job and, and being ah, such a good example of assessment intake. 

01:56:30
KAROLYN SENTOR Thank you. 

01:56:30
CRAIG WOODSMALL Great. 

01:56:35
Analysis of Both Sessions with Dr.'s Woodsmall, Beam and Sentor 

01:56:40
CRAIG WOODSMALL Okay, now that we've had that chance to watch a couple of intake demonstrations and talk about them ah… as a way to kinda wrap up today, I thought that we would go over a few general questions. Ah, the first is what if you're meeting with a client, who appears to have the same cultural background as you? Is it necessary to still ask them questions about their identity? 

01:57:05
BRENT BEAM You know, I… I would I', sure Karolyn will say this too absolutely it's important. Ah, just because it might appear that you have the similar cultural background based on kinda physical markers ah, does not at all guarantee that you have the same experience. Or that your cultural backgrounds mean the same things to each of you. Um… and it's an… an easy thing for counselors to miss. Ah, but very important to… to highlight. And I think Karolyn you and Kevin talked about this little bit in your kinda wrap up discussion, ah I think you know, as far as gender and gender identity just thinking of some physical markers able-bodiedness or… or not being able-bodied ah, racial or ethnic or cultural background, I mean these are all the things that you might appear to have a lot in common with somebody, but ah it certainly worth asking to find out. 

01:58:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah, and I would ah… definitely agree with that that it's important to always ask and to never assume. 

01:58:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:58:15
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah. 

01:58:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right a very risky thing to assume anything about any of our clients… 

01:58:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:58:20
CRAIG WOODSMALL (inaudible ) something is… is personal and complex with someone's identity. 

01:58:25
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm… And I think for beginning counselors it's probably helpful for them just to kinda think of it as all counseling is cross cultural counseling. 

01:58:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yes. Exactly. 

01:58:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah. 

01:58:40
CRAIG WOODSMALL The second question is given that the nature of our questions during an intake, can become very personal and have a potential to create discomfort for clients. 

01:58:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

01:58:50
CRAIG WOODSMALL There are any areas that you would avoid asking about ah… giving concerns about being intrusive things such as whether or not someone has a trauma, experienced trauma in their lives or as history of abuse. 

01:59:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… hmm. Yeah, I recognize that there are some very sensitive subjects, but I think ahh as difficult as it might be for the counselor, I think you have to think about what's best for the client and… and gathering as much information as you can is so important. So it's difficult as it is you still have to ask. But in a sensitive kind of way. 

01:59:30
BRENT BEAM Yeah, and… and I'm just thinking about my conversation with Nan and how her suicidal ideation was something that she really was reluctant to disclose. 

01:59:40
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh… huh… 

01:59:40
BRENT BEAM Ah, but had we not talked about that we've thought it would be a huge error on my part… 

01:59:45
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:59:45
BRENT BEAM …and then certainly not helpful for her… to have that lingering and not beyond the table. 

01:59:50
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

01:59:50
BRENT BEAM So, I absolutely agree with, with what you're saying. 

01:59:55
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah. 

01:59:55
BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

01:59:55
CRAIG WOODSMALL So is that important for beginning counselors to know that although it may be difficult to ask about these things, there are sometimes that legal and ethical reasons… 

02:00:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

02:00:05
CRAIG WOODSMALL Why the… to ask those… you know, difficult questions. But also in terms of your ability to be helpful to the client it's necessary to know these things. 

02:00:15
BRENT BEAM Couldn't (inaudible ) her. 

02:00:16
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh huh… 

02:00:16
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah, very good. Ah, I'm wondering too if… if you're working with a client and their aspects of either their presenting concerns or their cultural background that you don't have the time to get to or that you don't completely understand yourself. What would you then? 

02:00:35
BRENT BEAM Hmm… it, it seems like we both kinda ran into this with our clients… 

02:00:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh huh… 

02:00:40
BRENT BEAM …that there's much more to know than we're able to gather at the end of first session. Ah, and I'm just thinking about your attitude Karolyn about being open and not assuming that you have the whole story. 

02:00:50
KAROLYN SENTOR Right. 

02:00:50
BRENT BEAM Ah, the intake process isn't necessarily limited to one session. Ah, in fact, it's not, I think in philosophy not necessarily limited to the first ten sessions. 

02:01:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh huh… 

02:01:00
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

02:01:00
BRENT BEAM There is always something new to learn about your client. Ah, and so there is some comfort I think, for me at least knowing that there is some time to gather the information. But I… I also feel like it's timely to do this. 

02:01:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

02:01:15
BRENT BEAM Ah, and so if there is something that the counselors don't understand about their client or need more information about it's really incumbent(ph) upon us to ask about that. 

02:01:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

02:01:25
BRENT BEAM As soon we're aware that there is more that we don't know that's the time to follow up. 

02:01:30
CRAIG WOODSMALL Absolutely. 

02:01:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah. 

02:01:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL Okay. Although in your session with Nan, there was ah, a period of time where you were assessing the potential for ah suicidality with her. Ah, it was fairly clear that she wasn't in acute(ph) crisis. 

02:01:50
BRENT BEAM Sure. 

02:01:50
CRAIG WOODSMALL Ahh, but that could happen during an intake, ah and so it might be helpful ahh for us to talk a little bit about how that changes the intake process if you're working with the client, who ahh presents with more ahh serious thoughts and, and maybe even has a part of a plan or can guarantee their own safety or the safety of others. 

02:02:20
BRENT BEAM Sure… sure yeah. 

02:02:20
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah, I think in… in… in those instances your focus definitely has to shift to ah, risk management and safety issues. And ah, just getting more information about the ah, ideation and the frequency intensity of thoughts and any kind of plans. So… 

02:02:45
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

02:02:45
KAROLYN SENTOR …the focus definitely has to shift and ah, those questions… those general questions that ah, are part of the intake process you can… you can ask later… 

02:02:55
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

02:02:55
KAROLYN SENTOR …if you get the opportunity but. 

02:02:55
BRENT BEAM Uh… huh… and… and… it's and I think consistent with other things we've been talking about… 

02:03:00
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh huh… 

02:03:00
BRENT BEAM …it's not that that's at the expense of building rapport… 

02:03:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh huh… 

02:03:05
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

02:03:05
BRENT BEAM And can service (inaudible ) in the long term… 

02:03:07
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

02:03:07
BRENT BEAM …this had… has to be talked about. 

02:03:10
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

02:03:10
BRENT BEAM It's talked about because, it's our ethical and legal responsibility and also because it's part of the client feeling better. 

02:03:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. It's still important to ah, maintain focus on building that rapport um but to shift really the nature of your questions more towards assessing the level of risk in doing safety planning and that, that more general intake process can wait. 

02:03:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Right. 

02:03:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL Okay, I also noticed that ah, both of you in your intake demonstrations recommended individual counseling. Ah, that they come back and meet with you individually. Ah, there are certainly other options and it may be helpful for us to talk about ah, what those are and when you may consider something other than individual counseling as a recommendation. 

02:04:00
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh huh… 

02:04:00
BRENT BEAM Yeah, I… I was thinking about ah, actually about both of them, but Kevin in particular that group counseling could be really ah… 

02:04:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh huh… 

02:04:10
BRENT BEAM …a great fit for him… 

02:04:10
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

02:04:10
BRENT BEAM …even if it's just short term. Ah, clearly his need to connect the people is… is something that he derives a lot of strength and joy from and it's missing in his life right now. Ah, everything Nan in her own way could benefit from the group in terms of talking about what it's like not to be fully understood and seeing if she can receive or kinda create opportunities to be understood… receive some understanding or create opportunities for that. 

02:04:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

02:04:35
BRENT BEAM And just to have other people hopefully to share her experiences with you might have similar and kinda concerns. And group counseling is such an… it's a very efficacious, you know mode of therapy which is really well substantiated by research and cost effective and so a lot of agencies and university settings are moving that direction… 

02:05:00
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

02:05:00
BRENT BEAM …quite Rapidly. 

02:05:00
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

02:05:00
BRENT BEAM So (inaudible ) better choice. 

02:05:05
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

02:05:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah, I was thinking some other options could be, ah with relationship issues couples at therapy… 

02:05:10
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh huh… 

02:05:10
KAROLYN SENTOR …um family therapy, ah, sometimes bibliotherapy 

02:05:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

02:05:15
KAROLYN SENTOR And ah, which doesn't necessarily include like books(ph) ha ha ha… 

02:05:20
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah, it can be video(ph)… video(ph) therapy. 

02:05:25
KAROLYN SENTOR Right, video(ph) therapy ah, but those are some other options I can think. 

02:05:25
BRENT BEAM Yeah. 

02:05:30
CRAIG WOODSMALL Are there any ah, client characteristics representing concerns that you think would be a rule out for something like group therapy? 

02:05:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Hmm… I think level of functioning for specific kinds of groups, because ahh there are some groups that require a higher level of functioning for participation, so if a person is like severely depressed, or they're not able to engage… 

02:05:55
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

02:05:55
KAROLYN SENTOR …then that might be allowed or come… 

02:06:00
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

02:06:00
BRENT BEAM Ah, sometimes this is debatable but sometimes people clients with really strong characterological problems may have a harder time interacting with other people. 

02:06:10
KAROLYN SENTOR Uh… huh… 

02:06:10
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

02:06:10
BRENT BEAM It doesn't mean that group isn't a good option for them. 

02:06:10
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

02:06:10
BRENT BEAM Ahh but… but certainly considering how many, you know what the balance is among the group members in terms of their ability to function, you know personally is pretty critical. 

02:06:20
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

02:06:20
BRENT BEAM Um… 

02:06:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL Okay, it's not an automatic rule out, but it just requires a little bit more intentional part about the fit of that particular client with that particular group. 

02:06:30
BRENT BEAM Yeah, that's… that's my (inaudible ) for it. 

02:06:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL Okay, all right. Very good. Well um… I think that's about it. Um, any final thoughts or um… comments about today's demonstrations? 

02:06:50
BRENT BEAM I… I… I would say that its… its fantastic to… to watch another professional in action. 

02:06:55
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

02:06:55
BRENT BEAM Um… and really wonderful to… to observe another… to observe your… your style. And on it's been a lot of fun to work with the clients that we had today. 

02:07:05
CRAIG WOODSMALL Excellent. 

02:07:05
KAROLYN SENTOR Yeah, that was really helpful for me to kinda a reminder of a lot of things that I teach my um… first year grade students in counseling… 

02:07:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Uh huh… 

02:07:15
KAROLYN SENTOR …about those basic things… 

02:07:15
CRAIG WOODSMALL Yeah. 

02:07:15
KAROLYN SENTOR …to do in… in intakes that can be so helpful. And it was nice to get the client's perspective on how they um, perceived you know… 

02:07:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL Right. 

02:07:25
KAROLYN SENTOR …the process. 

02:07:25
BRENT BEAM Hmm 

02:07:25
CRAIG WOODSMALL I think that's a very good note to end on Karolyn reminder that ah, this counseling thing is so difficult that you always can benefit and then learning never really ends… 

02:07:35
KAROLYN SENTOR Absolutely. 

02:07:35
CRAIG WOODSMALL …even for… for season professionals and still helpful to be reminded of these things. 

02:07:40
KAROLYN SENTOR Yes. 

02:07:40
