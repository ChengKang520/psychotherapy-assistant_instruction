00:00:20
 Thanks for coming along today, Tommy. My... 

00:00:25
THOMAS It's Thomas. 

00:00:25
WENDY Oh, I apologize for that, Thomas. My name's Wendy. Um, and just before we get going, I just want to make sure that you feel comfortable with seeing an aboriginal female counsellor, because we could organize for you to see a man if you would prefer (crosstalk) that. 

00:00:40
THOMAS (crosstalk)No, it's all right, just get it over and done with. 

00:00:40
WENDY (crosstalk)You don't mind? Okay, fair enough. Now, um, where are you from, Thomas? Are you from around this way, or... 

00:00:45
THOMAS No, been over here for like 19 years, though I come from North Queensland. 

00:00:50
WENDY Oh, okay, you were (crosstalk)married in. 

00:00:55
THOMAS (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. 

00:00:55
WENDY Oh, right. (crosstalk)So... 

00:00:55
THOMAS (crosstalk)Married to a (ph)nonghai woman. 

00:00:55
WENDY Oh, great. You got kids? 

00:01:00
THOMAS Yep, three. 

00:01:00
WENDY Oh, (crosstalk)lovely. 

00:01:00
THOMAS (crosstalk)I got one about 19, son 19, daughter's just turned 15, and another son is about 11. 

00:01:10
WENDY Right, little fella. (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:01:15
THOMAS (crosstalk)Mmhmm. 

00:01:15
WENDY Well, I'm actually from up Broom Way, I'm not actually from down south, either. But, I've lived down here for quite a long time, so I know a lot of (ph)nonghai people down here. So, now, I believe you've come along because you need to make an application for an extraordinary license, is that right? 

00:01:30
THOMAS Yeah, that's the only reason I'm here. 

00:01:30
WENDY Right, okay. So, obviously you've lost your license, then? 

00:01:35
THOMAS Yeah, six months. 

00:01:35
WENDY Six months. How long ago was that, about a month ago? 

00:01:40
THOMAS Yeah. 

00:01:40
WENDY Right, yeah. Generally, you can put in an application after a month. (crosstalk)So... 

00:01:45
THOMAS (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:01:45
WENDY Um, six months is quite a long time. Is that the first time you've lost your license? 

00:01:50
THOMAS Nah, second time. 

00:01:50
WENDY Second time, is it? Okay, so, I guess that's frustrating for you. Are, are, are you working? 

00:01:55
THOMAS Yeah, I'm working as an orderly at the local hospital. 

00:02:00
WENDY Oh, great. How long have you worked there? 

00:02:00
THOMAS 12 years. 

00:02:05
WENDY Oh, so, right, so you've (crosstalk)been there a long time, then. 

00:02:05
THOMAS (crosstalk)Mmm. Yeah. 

00:02:05
WENDY Right, that's great. So, for this extraordinary license, there's a requirement that you needed to get a little bit of alcohol counselling, is that was, (crosstalk)the issue? 

00:02:15
THOMAS (crosstalk)Yeah, well, that's what they said. 

00:02:20
WENDY Yeah, that's what they said. 

00:02:20
THOMAS (crosstalk)Mmm. 

00:02:20
WENDY (crosstalk)And did they sort of say, you know, that you had to have, how often you had to come, or was is just for a s-, to come for one session, for an assessment? 

00:02:25
THOMAS Just for an assessment, I think. (crosstalk)That's it. 

00:02:30
WENDY (crosstalk)Okay. And generally they like us to write a little report, um, are you happy with that, although I appreciate that, you know, things are confidential, but generally when you come for a purpose, we're required to write something down about how the session went, and... 

00:02:45
THOMAS Eh. 

00:02:45
WENDY Eh, would you, are you happy with that? 

00:02:50
THOMAS Yeah, (crosstalk)whatever. As long as I get my license back. 

00:02:50
WENDY (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. 

00:02:55
[music] 

00:02:55
Assessment: "I don't see it as a problem" 

00:02:55
WENDY I realize you don't really want to be here, but you're here because you need to apply for your extraordinary license. So, (crosstalk)can I get a little bit of picture of what's actually been going on in terms of your drinking. 

00:03:05
THOMAS (crosstalk)Hmm. 

00:03:05
WENDY Um, how often do you drink? 

00:03:10
THOMAS I only drink on the weekends. 

00:03:10
WENDY Okay. 

00:03:10
THOMAS Cuz, like, with my job, I can't drink through the week. 

00:03:15
WENDY No, of course not. So, you drink, what, so, Friday night, knock off, have a few drinks then, and then through the weekend? 

00:03:25
THOMAS Yeah. 

00:03:25
WENDY Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how much you actually drink on a Friday night? 

00:03:30
THOMAS I don't know, it's sort of a, um, my brothers come around and we sit down in the backyard, have a barbie, sort of thing, and... 

00:03:35
WENDY Right. 

00:03:35
THOMAS A few bottles of Jim Beam. 

00:03:40
WENDY A few bottles of Jim Beam, (crosstalk)between a few of you. 

00:03:40
THOMAS (crosstalk)Yeah. Oh yeah. 

00:03:45
WENDY What, exactly, is a few bottles of Jim Beam? 

00:03:45
THOMAS Uh, it had to be about four or five. 

00:03:50
WENDY Right, and that's drinking with how many people? 

00:03:55
THOMAS About six, something like that. 

00:03:55
WENDY Okay. So, would it be fair to say that, perhaps, on a Friday night you might have nearly a whole bottle of Jim Beam? 

00:04:00
THOMAS Oh, close to two. 

00:04:00
WENDY Oh, close to two, (crosstalk)okay, so that's quite a bit of Jim Beam. 

00:04:05
THOMAS (crosstalk)Hmm. 

00:04:05
WENDY All right, so what do you have on a Saturday, then? Do you keep drinking, or... 

00:04:10
THOMAS Yeah, it's sort of like, go through Friday night to the early hours of morning, have a bit of a camp, and then (crosstalk)get up and head down to the T.A.B. 

00:04:20
WENDY (crosstalk)Mmhmm. Okay, yep. 

00:04:20
THOMAS On a Saturday, (crosstalk)and, with the same mob sort of thing. 

00:04:20
WENDY (crosstalk)Mmhmm. Yep. 

00:04:25
THOMAS And sometimes don't come home till Sunday, Sunday night. 

00:04:30
WENDY Oh all right, so really, once you're with your, your mates or your c- family on a Friday (crosstalk)night, that's sort of it, really, for the weekend, is that what you're saying? 

00:04:35
THOMAS (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. 

00:04:40
WENDY So you, sort of drink quite heavily on a Friday night, maybe up to a couple of bottles of Jim Beam? 

00:04:40
THOMAS Mmhmm. 

00:04:45
WENDY And then, sort of have a bit of a fade and a camp, and then get up the next day, go to T.A.B., and then, sort of, (crosstalk)what, have a few drinks in the afternoon? 

00:04:50
THOMAS (crosstalk)Yeah, then, then the family don't see me till Sunday. 

00:04:55
WENDY Your family don't see you till (crosstalk)Sunday. That... 

00:04:55
THOMAS (crosstalk)Mmhmm. Cuz I gotta like, sort of, come home and sober up ready for work the next day. 

00:05:00
WENDY Hmm. Hmm, okay. Tell me, do you take any other substances, take any other drugs? (crosstalk)No? 

00:05:05
THOMAS (crosstalk)No. Just smoke cigarettes, that's all. 

00:05:10
WENDY (crosstalk)Smoke cigarettes, right. 

00:05:10
THOMAS (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:05:10
WENDY But, so it's just, alcohol is your, well... 

00:05:15
THOMAS Oh, I used to get into a bit of ganja when I was young. 

00:05:20
WENDY Okay, but that, that hasn't (crosstalk)been for a, a long time. 

00:05:20
THOMAS (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:05:20
WENDY All right. So, clearly, it seems that what you are drinking, sort of from Friday through to Sunday is probably well above what the recommended sort of national guidelines. Um, were you aware of that? 

00:05:40
THOMAS Well I don't know, I don't know about them white fellas' (crosstalk)guidelines or something, it's just that, me and the mob been doing that for years. 

00:05:45
WENDY (crosstalk)No? And boys, sort of, yeah, been doing that for years. 

00:05:45
THOMAS Yeah. 

00:05:50
WENDY When you say you've been doing it for years, could you tell me exactly how many years it's been (crosstalk)like that? 

00:05:55
THOMAS (crosstalk)I started drinking in high school, I think. 

00:05:55
WENDY Okay. So, how old are you now, Thomas? 

00:06:00
THOMAS Uh, going on to 41. 

00:06:00
WENDY Ah. So we're talking about possibly 20, 25 years drinking. 

00:06:05
THOMAS Yeah, I slowed down a bit when I met the Missus. 

00:06:10
WENDY Oh, when was that? 

00:06:10
THOMAS In the, hmm, 20 years ago. 

00:06:15
WENDY Mmhmm. Okay, so, but, that's changed again, now? 

00:06:20
THOMAS Yeah, you just sort of like, I don't know, I suppose, um, I don't see it as a problem, it's just something that I do on the weekends. 

00:06:25
WENDY Hmm. 

00:06:30
[music] 

00:06:30
Motivational Interviewing: "I've got to relieve the stress somehow" 

00:06:30
WENDY Thomas, tell me what you really actually like about your drinking. 

00:06:35
THOMAS Oh, I suppose socializing with the brothers, and... 

00:06:40
WENDY So it's got that really s- good social aspect to it. 

00:06:45
THOMAS Yeah. 

00:06:45
WENDY Yeah. 

00:06:45
THOMAS I don't mind getting charged up and having a good time. 

00:06:45
WENDY Hmm. Hmm. Mm, and what else do you really like about it? Sort of socializing with the brothers, getting charged up, having a good time, (crosstalk)what else do you... 

00:06:55
THOMAS It gets me away from the family for a weekend. 

00:06:55
WENDY Okay, you like having a bit of a break from the family, do you? 

00:07:00
THOMAS My wife, yeah, either that or they like having a break from me. 

00:07:05
WENDY Okay. Mmhmm, (crosstalk)all right then. 

00:07:05
THOMAS (crosstalk)Probably coming home pretty shitty through the week or something, like, bad day at work or something like that. 

00:07:10
WENDY Hmm. So you see, that's another good thing about it, is it? Sort of, kick back, relax after a hard week at work? 

00:07:15
THOMAS Yeah. 

00:07:20
WENDY Mmm. Mmm. 

00:07:20
THOMAS Just gotta relieve the stress somehow. 

00:07:20
WENDY Yeah, sure. Okay, well, we just sort of looked at some of the things you really enjoy about your drinking. Can we just look at the other side now, is there anything that you don't particularly like about your drinking? 

00:07:35
THOMAS Nah. Nothing, really. 

00:07:35
WENDY No? Can't think of anything that... 

00:07:40
THOMAS How long is this gonna be? 

00:07:40
WENDY I appreciate that we've sort of been going on a little bit long here, but, I sort, I, I guess all we can do is make the most of this session. 

00:07:50
THOMAS Hmm. 

00:07:50
WENDY And, uh, and then we'll take it from there. But, you know, you're under no obligation to have to stay. 

00:07:55
THOMAS Yeah, no, I might as well. 

00:08:00
WENDY Mmm. Okay. So we were just looking a little bit at, perhaps, if there's anything that you don't particularly like about your drinking, you sort of mentioned before that you like to sort of get away from the family and have a bit of break 

00:08:10
THOMAS Yeah, well, I suppose, the Missus don't like me drinking that much. 

00:08:15
WENDY Right. (crosstalk)What... 

00:08:15
THOMAS (crosstalk)Yeah, she's... 

00:08:20
WENDY Why would that be? 

00:08:20
THOMAS I don't know. Um, I suppose, when I've had a few drinks and that, she gets on my nerves, or I get on her nerves, and (crosstalk)then we start fighting. 

00:08:30
WENDY (crosstalk)Mmm. Okay. 

00:08:30
THOMAS Whatever, it's not really good for the kids. 

00:08:30
WENDY (crosstalk)No. 

00:08:30
THOMAS (crosstalk)Oh, they getting old enough now, but, the young fella's still 11, so... 

00:08:40
WENDY So, I guess that's something that you maybe don't particularly like about your drinking, is that the kids get a bit (crosstalk)upset, or... 

00:08:45
THOMAS (crosstalk)Oh, especially her, like, she turns them against me when I'm drinking, sort of thing. 

00:08:50
WENDY Oh, I see. 

00:08:50
THOMAS Yeah. 

00:08:50
THOMAS Mmm. Okay. So, apart from the fact that it's sort of obviously affecting the family a little bit, is there anything else that you don't particularly like about, I guess you don't like losing your license, do you? 

00:09:05
THOMAS Nah, not really. 

00:09:05
WENDY Hmm. 

00:09:05
THOMAS Without the car... 

00:09:05
WENDY Hmm. 

00:09:05
THOMAS That's my whole means of escape. 

00:09:10
WENDY Right, so (crosstalk)that's... 

00:09:10
THOMAS (crosstalk)Now I gotta rely on the brothers to come pick me up. 

00:09:15
WENDY Okay, right, so now you haven't, sort of, got your vehicle to get around, no means of escape from the family. 

00:09:20
THOMAS Yeah, sort of. 

00:09:25
WENDY Hmm. 

00:09:25
THOMAS Hm. It never really used to be like this. 

00:09:30
WENDY Okay. 

00:09:30
THOMAS Yeah, we used to have a good time and that, and then when the Missus gave up drinking... 

00:09:35
WENDY Oh, I see, so your wife used to drink (crosstalk)too, but she doesn't drink. 

00:09:40
THOMAS (crosstalk)Yeah, we used to, we used to party all together, go to, nightclub and everything, and have a good time. 

00:09:45
WENDY Is this when you were young fellows, before the kids? 

00:09:45
THOMAS Yeah, oh, even when we had the kids, like, she'd drop them off at her mom's place (crosstalk)and that, and we'd go out Friday night and Saturday night and everything like that. 

00:09:55
WENDY (crosstalk)Mmm. Mmm. 

00:09:55
THOMAS (inaudible )as I started getting older, oh, my son he's 19 now, and he's, um, starting to hit the pubs and everything like that. 

00:10:05
WENDY Hmm. 

00:10:05
THOMAS And, you know, the Missus just says, oh, you're following your father's footsteps. 

00:10:15
WENDY Right. 

00:10:15
THOMAS Sort of thing, so... 

00:10:15
WENDY And that sort of (crosstalk)leads to the fighting? 

00:10:15
THOMAS (crosstalk)Yeah, and he's not working at the moment, or anything like that, and... 

00:10:20
WENDY So, this... 

00:10:20
THOMAS Well, he's got his own circle of mates, sort of thing. 

00:10:20
WENDY Mmm. 

00:10:25
THOMAS (crosstalk)Sort of... 

00:10:25
WENDY (crosstalk)So, you're obviously concerned about your children, and... 

00:10:30
THOMAS Yeah, sort of. 

00:10:30
WENDY All right. Let's just go back to you for a moment, Thomas. Is there anything else that you don't particularly like about your drinking, it, sort of it's clear that it's, sort of, affecting the family a little bit, and having no license is annoying because you can't get out and about. What about, how's your health, you know? How, has it had any effect on your health that you're aware of? 

00:10:55
THOMAS Not really. I just don't like getting up with hangovers in the morning. 

00:11:00
WENDY Hangovers (crosstalk)are the downside of a good night on the grog, isn't it? 

00:11:05
THOMAS (crosstalk)Yeah, then you get aggro, and... Hmm. 

00:11:05
WENDY Hmm. Yep, so hangovers are a bit of an issue for you? 

00:11:10
THOMAS Yeah, that's when I get aggro and get a bit pissed off with the Missus, and (crosstalk)that's when the fighting starts happening. 

00:11:15
WENDY (crosstalk)Right. Okay. 

00:11:15
THOMAS She just, nag, nag, nag, all the time. 

00:11:20
WENDY When you've got a hangover. 

00:11:20
THOMAS Yeah. Or, you know, even when I'm drunk. 

00:11:25
WENDY Right. (crosstalk)You get, you get... 

00:11:25
THOMAS (crosstalk)And instead of letting me coming home and going to sleep or whatever, you know, if she'd stay out of my way, everything would be okay. 

00:11:30
WENDY Okay, (crosstalk)so... 

00:11:30
THOMAS (crosstalk)But no, she's gotta be at me. 

00:11:35
WENDY So, getting angry, is that a concern for you? 

00:11:35
THOMAS Yeah, well I, I don't, well I don't like to think I'm an angry fella. 

00:11:45
WENDY Right. 

00:11:45
THOMAS I don't know, but, well I'm pretty, pretty well good to get along with everyone, and... 

00:11:45
WENDY Mmm. Get on well with your (crosstalk)work mates. 

00:11:50
THOMAS (crosstalk)(inaudible )Yeah. 

00:11:52
WENDY Mmm. 

00:11:52
THOMAS Get along well with them, sort of. 

00:11:55
WENDY Mmm. Okay, so, I guess we could say that your, some of the things you don't like about it is hangovers, um, (crosstalk)but, I guess we get used to hangovers in some way, don't we, we sort of... 

00:12:10
THOMAS (crosstalk)Mmm. Yeah. 

00:12:10
WENDY Yeah. And, you're a bit concerned about the family and maybe the impact that's sort of having on your, sort of, older son (crosstalk)because he's sort of out doing the pub scene now, yep. 

00:12:20
THOMAS (crosstalk)Yeah. And even, like, um, my daughter, she's starting to worry me a bit. 

00:12:25
WENDY How old's your daughter, again? 

00:12:25
THOMAS She's 15. 

00:12:25
WENDY Okay. (crosstalk)And why is she, that a concern? 

00:12:30
THOMAS (crosstalk)Yeah, she's, um, she's still in high school, but she's, like, hanging around this little circle of, like, some of my nieces and nephews, and that, they're all into this ganja stuff. 

00:12:40
WENDY Mmm. Mmm. 

00:12:45
THOMAS And she's getting into that, too. 

00:12:45
WENDY Okay. So that, that's obviously a concern as well (crosstalk)for you. 

00:12:50
THOMAS (crosstalk)Yeah I, I told her off a bit, I've just tried to sit down and talk to her and that, and her reaction was like, well dad, you can't talk; you're an alcoholic. 

00:13:00
WENDY I see. (crosstalk)How did that make you feel, with your daughter telling you that you're an alcoholic? 

00:13:00
THOMAS (crosstalk)(inaudible )I felt like I could, like I didn't have the right to tell her off. Hello. 

00:13:05
WENDY Oh, so you, you actually felt, (crosstalk)not good? 

00:13:10
THOMAS (crosstalk)Yeah, cuz she sort of, um, chucked it back in my face, sort of thing. 

00:13:10
WENDY Right, so what you're saying is, that, you know, given that, even though on one hand you're saying that you're, you quite like your drinking and it's not, you know, really a concern. (crosstalk)On the other hand, there are sort of things that are starting to worry you about... 

00:13:25
THOMAS (crosstalk)Mmm. I suppose when you, when you, like, dig down deep, there are issues there that I never realized before. 

00:13:30
WENDY Right, that you, you never really given it much thought before. 

00:13:35
THOMAS No. 

00:13:35
WENDY No. So, what you're saying is, that this is really sort of the first time you've sort of thought about how that's affecting your family. 

00:13:45
THOMAS Yeah, first time, sort of. 

00:13:45
WENDY Hmm.

00:14:40
WENDY No? 

00:14:40
JAMES No, I was working in (inaudible ), but, I don't like the mob much, you know? 

00:14:45
WENDY Right. 

00:14:45
JAMES Mmm. 

00:14:45
WENDY So, you're just not working at the moment? (crosstalk)No? 

00:14:50
JAMES (crosstalk)No, no, no. 

00:14:50
WENDY Okay. 

00:14:50
JAMES I was thinking about an apprenticeship or something, or, (crosstalk)or... apprenticeship or something, eh. 

00:14:55
WENDY (crosstalk)Oh, that sounds good, hmm. Oh, that sounds excellent. Mmm. So, into sport? Footy? Yep? Do you play? Do you play, James? 

00:15:05
JAMES Yeah. 

00:15:05
WENDY Yeah? (crosstalk)Yeah? 

00:15:05
JAMES (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:15:05
WENDY And what about you, Sasha, are you into sport, too? 

00:15:05
SASHA Uh, netball. 

00:15:10
WENDY Netball? Very good at netball? 

00:15:10
SASHA Yeah. 

00:15:10
WENDY Yeah? Well, that's good. And what do you, how do you spend your weekends? You're, I guess you're both playing netball and footy most of the time. 

00:15:20
SASHA Mmm, sometimes. 

00:15:20
WENDY Sometimes. What about you, James? 

00:15:20
JAMES Well, well, I mean, I, I hang, hang out on the mats when they're playing footy. (crosstalk)(inaudible ) 

00:15:28
WENDY (crosstalk)Okay. Go and watch a few games? 

00:15:30
JAMES Mmm, you know, just what's happening, you know? 

00:15:30
WENDY Mmm. Mmm. 

00:15:30
JAMES Mmm. 

00:15:35
WENDY Mmm. Okay, well, can you tell me a bit about why you've made an appointment to come and see me today? 

00:15:40
SASHA We never made it. 

00:15:40
JAMES Yeah. 

00:15:40
WENDY (inaudible ) 

00:15:44
JAMES We had to come along. Dad wouldn't come unless if we come. 

00:15:45
WENDY Oh, this is your dad, okay. 

00:15:45
JAMES Yeah. 

00:15:50
WENDY So, that was the deal was it? If you come along... 

00:15:50
JAMES Mmm. 

00:15:50
WENDY Then, you guys would come along, as well. 

00:15:55
JAMES Mmm. 

00:15:55
SASHA Yeah. 

00:15:55
WENDY Okay. Oh, well that's good, you're following through with the deal, then, with your dad. 

00:16:00
JAMES Mmm. 

00:16:00
WENDY Okay, that shows that you're obviously concerned about your dad, then. Is that right? 

00:16:05
JAMES Mmm. 

00:16:05
SASHA Yeah, he drink too much. 

00:16:05
WENDY He drinks too much. Okay. And, as you know, he's came here recently cuz he needs to get a, a new license. 

00:16:15
SASHA Yeah. 

00:16:15
WENDY So, um, an extraordinary license, wasn't it. So, can you tell me a little bit about how that's been affecting both of you, then? 

00:16:25
JAMES (inaudible )You know, well, I don't know, he get drunk all the time. 

00:16:30
WENDY Does he? 

00:16:30
SASHA We never see him, either. 

00:16:35
WENDY You never see him. 

00:16:35
JAMES You might as well say, sometimes, just like, we don't have no father around. 

00:16:40
WENDY I see. 

00:16:40
JAMES Mmm. 

00:16:40
WENDY Mmm. Okay, and so, how long has it been like that for you both? 

00:16:45
SASHA (crosstalk)Too long. I can't remember. 

00:16:45
JAMES (crosstalk)(inaudible ) 

00:16:47
WENDY Mmm. 

00:16:47
JAMES He try give up sometimes, you know, but you might as well say it not worth it to him. 

00:16:55
WENDY Right, so he's actually sort of tried to give up sometimes, (crosstalk)but goes back again. 

00:17:00
JAMES (crosstalk)Mmm. 

00:17:00
[music] 

00:17:00
Exploring the Impact 

00:17:05
WENDY What happens, you know, what, what is it that you're particularly concerned about your dad when he drinks? 

00:17:10
JAMES Well, I don't like it how he pick on her. 

00:17:10
WENDY Right. Do you feel that too, Sasha? 

00:17:15
SASHA Yeah. 

00:17:15
WENDY Yeah. When you say 'pick on her', how do you mean? 

00:17:20
JAMES Well he, he worry about our problems. He don't look at himself, you know? 

00:17:25
WENDY Right. Hmm. 

00:17:25
JAMES He found, he found out that sis was smoking ganja, and he got (inaudible )for that. But he never think about himself. 

00:17:32
WENDY Mmm. 

00:17:35
JAMES And what he do. 

00:17:35
WENDY Mmm. I guess when you're sort of in this situation that sometimes having to chill for a few cones on the weekend's one way of escaping, isn't it, (crosstalk)Sash? 

00:17:45
SASHA (crosstalk)Hmm. 

00:17:45
WENDY Hmm. And what about you, James? You smoke a bit of ganja, too? 

00:17:50
JAMES Eh, (crosstalk)a little bit, sort of thing. 

00:17:50
WENDY (crosstalk)A little bit. Hmm. Hmm. 

00:17:55
JAMES I like going pub now. 

00:17:55
WENDY Yeah. Well, you're 19. 

00:17:55
JAMES Mmhmm. 

00:17:55
WENDY Yep. That's pretty, sort of, what most fellows do on the (crosstalk)weekend, go to the pub, have a few drinks, a few cones. 

00:18:05
JAMES (crosstalk)Mmhmm. Yeah. Mmm. 

00:18:05
WENDY Mmm. 

00:18:05
SASHA We need something to make us feel better. 

00:18:10
WENDY Yeah. So, when you're saying you need something to make you feel better, obviously things haven't been right for you for a while, then, at home. 

00:18:15
SASHA No. Like he don't care about us. 

00:18:15
WENDY He doesn't care about you. Okay. And what about mom, can you tell me a bit about mom, does mom drink too? 

00:18:25
SASHA She used to, but she stopped. 

00:18:30
WENDY Oh, okay. 

00:18:30
JAMES Mmm. 

00:18:30
WENDY How long ago did mom stop? 

00:18:30
JAMES I think, long time. You know, when, was, when was (inaudible ). 

00:18:38
SASHA Yeah. 

00:18:38
WENDY Right. So she, you've never seen mom as a drinker, really. 

00:18:40
SASHA Not really, no. 

00:18:40
WENDY No. But just dad, been drinking pretty heavy (crosstalk)for a few years. 

00:18:45
JAMES (crosstalk)Hmm. 

00:18:45
WENDY So, how does that make you feel? 

00:18:50
JAMES No good, you know? 

00:18:50
WENDY Hmm. Hmm. 

00:18:55
SASHA Ashamed, too, cuz everyone knows. 

00:18:55
WENDY Right. 

00:18:55
SASHA And at school they ask questions, and, (inaudible )shame. 

00:19:02
WENDY Right, so it's actually, it's not just about how it affects you at home, but, people, (crosstalk)you know, that people know about it, and... 

00:19:05
JAMES (crosstalk)He, he, he came to the football drunk, you know? 

00:19:10
WENDY Did he... 

00:19:10
JAMES And got kicked out. 

00:19:10
WENDY Ah. (crosstalk)Hmm. 

00:19:15
JAMES (crosstalk)And then the (inaudible )we're playing football, and I look back, I see my drunken father there, screaming out for me, no? 

00:19:20
WENDY True. Mmm. 

00:19:20
JAMES (ph)Insane, no? 

00:19:25
WENDY Mmm. Well I can see that that that, that would be a really difficult sort of thing to have to deal with and, and if it's sort of been very regularly lately, I can understand why, why you're concerned. Um, can you tell me since he's sort of come along, he's, you said he's tried before and, and then he sort of stopped and, and now, you know, he's sort of come along recently because he needs to get his extraordinary license. Um... 

00:19:50
SASHA He only want his license so he can drive to the pub, cuz he too lazy to walk. 

00:19:55
WENDY Right, okay. So, really nothing much has changed since (crosstalk)he's lost his license, then. 

00:20:05
SASHA (crosstalk)No. 

00:20:05
JAMES He try to get me to drop him off pub, you know? 

00:20:05
WENDY Okay, (crosstalk)you've got your license, have you? Hmm. 

00:20:05
JAMES (crosstalk)That's why I take off, yeah, that's why I take off, you know? 

00:20:10
WENDY Right. 

00:20:10
JAMES I'll take off before he come home from work. 

00:20:15
[music] 

00:20:15
Assessment: "We need something to make us feel better" 

00:20:20
WENDY Can you tell me a little bit about your own use at the moment, like, James, how, when did you start drinking? 

00:20:25
JAMES I've been drinking from, around a couple years now. 

00:20:30
WENDY Mmhmm. Mmhmm. 

00:20:30
JAMES Unless, what, maybe two, three years now? 

00:20:35
WENDY Okay. 

00:20:35
JAMES When I was about 16 or something. 

00:20:40
WENDY Uh huh, okay. And how did that start? You just sort of started drinking (crosstalk)with your... 

00:20:45
JAMES (crosstalk)(inaudible )He gave me (inaudible )when mom, when mom wasn't around, you know? 

00:20:48
WENDY (crosstalk)Oh, your dad. Right. Mmhmm. 

00:20:50
JAMES They was having, they was having a big charge-up, you know? And he gave me, he gave me beer then, a (crosstalk)can of beer. 

00:20:55
WENDY (crosstalk)Oh, okay. So you had a couple of beers with your dad. That was your sort of first drinking session, right. And, since then, you've actually sort of more with your mates, cousins? 

00:21:05
JAMES Mmm. 

00:21:10
WENDY Yep. 

00:21:10
JAMES Mmm. 

00:21:10
WENDY (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:21:10
JAMES (crosstalk)Mmm. 

00:21:10
WENDY So, what, you just drink every weekend? 

00:21:15
JAMES Eh, it, you know, what, what happening with the boys do, you know, well, when we got, you know, something on, we'll go have a few drinks. 

00:21:25
WENDY Mmm. 

00:21:25
JAMES You know, go, go over to my mate's place, you know, it just depends. But usually, you know, we'll drink on Friday. 

00:21:35
WENDY Mmm. 

00:21:35
JAMES During the week sometimes, if somebody got (inaudible ). You know, but I'm, usually after footy, we'll go have a drink after footy. 

00:21:45
WENDY Okay. And tell me a bit about you, Sasha. You've been smoking a few cones. 

00:21:50
SASHA Yeah. 

00:21:50
WENDY When did you start smoking ganja? 

00:21:55
SASHA A year or so ago. 

00:21:55
WENDY Right, so last year sometime. Mmhmm. And, h-how often do you have a smoke of ganja? 

00:22:05
SASHA On the weekend. 

00:22:05
WENDY On the weekends. What, just a few cones? 

00:22:05
SASHA Yeah. 

00:22:10
WENDY Mmhmm. And it, sort of, is it hard to get ganja at, at your age, do you find it hard (crosstalk)getting ganja? 

00:22:15
SASHA (crosstalk)No. 

00:22:15
WENDY No? 

00:22:15
JAMES She, she don't smoke that much. 

00:22:20
WENDY No? 

00:22:20
JAMES No. 

00:22:20
WENDY Okay. What you're saying is that, you know, you, you've come along today and, and clearly that your dad's drinking is a, been a real concern for both of you, and you've sort of been sick and tired of him not being around and, well, causing you shame; other people are talking about it, you gave the example of the footy, James. So, I mean, I can understand that that's, you know, a real concern for you. 

00:22:45
[music] 

00:22:45
Motivational Interviewing: "I have no worries" 

00:22:45
WENDY Now just tell me, both of you, that, what is it that you particularly like about, you know, having a few cones, Sasha? What's particularly enjoyable about that? 

00:22:55
SASHA Just makes me feel better, and then I don't have to think about dad. 

00:23:00
WENDY Right, so, you like the feeling; it makes you feel better, makes you feel good? 

00:23:05
SASHA Yeah. 

00:23:05
WENDY Okay. What else do you like about it? 

00:23:05
SASHA It's just, I have no worries when I'm doing it. 

00:23:10
WENDY Have no worries when you've been smoking a bit of ganja, okay. And tell me, James, what is it that you really like about your drinking and a few smokes? 

00:23:20
JAMES Ah, I mean, I like hanging out with my mates. 

00:23:20
WENDY Hmm. Hmm. 

00:23:25
JAMES Way to get away from home, too, go down the pub, you know. 

00:23:25
WENDY Right, bit of escape, (crosstalk)socialize with your mates, cousins and things. Yeah. 

00:23:30
JAMES (crosstalk)Mmm. Mmm. 

00:23:30
WENDY Okay, is there anything else you really like about it? 

00:23:35
JAMES No, not really, I'm, you know? 

00:23:40
WENDY More from social (crosstalk)reasons that you like to have a few drinks. 

00:23:40
JAMES (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:23:45
WENDY Would you say that, is it, yours quite social too, (crosstalk)Sasha? 

00:23:45
SASHA (crosstalk)Yeah, with all my cousins, we go and sit down. 

00:23:50
WENDY Okay, so, all your cousins, you get together and you (crosstalk)have a few cones? 

00:23:50
SASHA (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:23:50
WENDY Okay. All right, well, I mean, obviously, you know, that, you having a few smokes and drinks and it's something that you enjoy and it's, let's, sort of getting away from home and escaping, but is there anything about it that you actually don't like? Sasha, is there anything about you smoking ganja that you don't actually like? 

00:24:10
SASHA Not really. I don't smoke enough of it to forget what I've been doing. 

00:24:15
WENDY Right, so, that, you've seen that as a problem with other people that you know, (crosstalk)do you? 

00:24:15
SASHA (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:24:15
WENDY Yeah, they sometimes forget. 

00:24:20
JAMES I don't like it when she miss out on school. 

00:24:20
WENDY Right, that's a concern for you. Is that, does that happen sometimes, Sasha, sometimes you haven't been going to school because you, what, because you've had too much (crosstalk)ganja? 

00:24:30
SASHA (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:24:30
WENDY (crosstalk)What happens... 

00:24:30
SASHA (crosstalk)And then they tell dad. 

00:24:30
WENDY (crosstalk)Oh. 

00:24:30
SASHA (crosstalk)And then he belt me. 

00:24:35
WENDY I see. So, I guess that's something that you really don't like about (crosstalk)smoking ganja is when you haven't been going to school and your dad finds out about that. 

00:24:45
SASHA (crosstalk)Hmm. Yep. 

00:24:45
WENDY Yep. Is there anything else that you can think of that you don't like about it? 

00:24:50
SASHA Not really. 

00:24:50
WENDY Not really? But that, that sort of causes you a bit of concern, though. (crosstalk)Hmm. 

00:24:55
SASHA (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:24:55
WENDY What about you, James? Is there anything that you don't particularly like about your drinking or your ganja? 

00:25:00
JAMES No, I'm right, I do what I like to do, you know? 

00:25:05
WENDY Mmm. You don't see any issues around? 

00:25:10
JAMES Mmm. 

00:25:10
WENDY No? You're actually (crosstalk)quite... 

00:25:10
JAMES (crosstalk)I'm, I'm single man now, (inaudible ). 

00:25:16
WENDY (crosstalk)Yep. 

00:25:16
JAMES I'm at, I'm past 18, I don't, I can do what I like to do, you know? 

00:25:20
WENDY That's right, you're certainly of legal age to be drinking, although we know that ganja is against the law. Mmm. 

00:25:25
JAMES Everybody smoke, you know? 

00:25:25
WENDY Hmm. Hmm. So, what you're saying Sash is that, on one hand, both of you actually, you know, or you particularly like your, your cones, but, there's that other side there that it's sort of, you know, you haven't been turning up to school, sometimes, and, and then that's when your dad finds out and then that's sort of, (crosstalk)get worried that you're gonna get, perhaps, a hiding or something. 

00:25:50
SASHA (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:25:50
WENDY Yeah. That must concern you too a bit, does it, James? 

00:25:55
JAMES I feel like smashing him, you know? 

00:25:55
WENDY Mmm. You're obviously both very close, aren't you? 

00:26:00
SASHA Yeah. 

00:26:00
WENDY Hmm. You've been looking after each other for a long time, no doubt, if (crosstalk)things have been like you've described at home. 

00:26:05
JAMES (crosstalk)Mmm. 

00:26:05
WENDY Mmm. Has it ever come to that, James? Where you've thought... 

00:26:10
JAMES Yeah. 

00:26:10
WENDY Yeah? 

00:26:10
JAMES I punched him once, you know? 

00:26:15
WENDY Hmm. And was that after you'd been drinking? 

00:26:20
JAMES Yeah, yeah drinking, but that wasn't why. 

00:26:25
WENDY No, it was more because you were cross because, (crosstalk)what was happening to little sister. 

00:26:25
JAMES (crosstalk)Mmm. 

00:26:30
[music] 

00:26:30
Ways of Reducing Harm 

00:26:35
WENDY Okay, Sasha, so I think it's sort of clear that, the problem areas for you is actually when you're missing out on school, which then puts you, perhaps, at risk of dad finding out and you're copping it later at home. 

00:26:45
SASHA Hmm. 

00:26:50
WENDY So, and, you're, that seems to concern you a little bit so, maybe if we can just look here very briefly at, perhaps, ways we can keep you safe so, number one, you're not missing out on school and you, you're safe from dad in some respects. So, what do you think you could do about that? 

00:27:05
SASHA Not smoke before school. 

00:27:10
WENDY Right. Is that something you think that you can actually manage at the moment? 

00:27:15
SASHA Yeah. 

00:27:15
WENDY Yeah? And so, what you're saying is, if, if you just don't smoke before school and then just go back to how it was before, just on the weekends, that woud be something you think you'd be able to do? 

00:27:30
SASHA Yeah. 

00:27:30
[music] 

00:27:30
Healing Time 

00:27:35
WENDY You've both come in here today, you're obviously concerned about your dad, um, and his drinking and, and, sort of it's been going on for a long time now, and you've, in some ways, you've had enough. Um, obviously when I see your father again that, you know, what we've talked about today is, is confidential, I'm not gonna tell him all, all your secrets, but I think it's good for dads to know that, you know, you're concerned about his drinking because how it's been affecting you in, (crosstalk)in your lives, at, and your social lives like the footy story and you've been saying people know and it's shame. 

00:28:10
JAMES (crosstalk)Mmm. Mmhmm. 

00:28:10
WENDY And, I think, you know, when I spoke to your dad last too, he was actually really quite concerned about you kids as well. So, it's, it's pretty obvious that all of you actually really care about each other, but we need to, perhaps, get you all together so we've got the opportunity to go over some of these, a lot of issues here that we've discussed today, really. And sometimes it's helpful if we could get, perhaps, dad to come in with both of you so we can all have a little bit of a yarn about it together, and start looking at why is it, perhaps, you mob as a family, and even (crosstalk)include mom if you like, and how, you know, because that's the aboriginal way, isn't it? 

00:28:50
SASHA (crosstalk)Hmm. 

00:28:50
WENDY We generally, our mob really look after each other and families really support one another, and maybe there's an opportunity here that we could get you all sort of talking at least, for a starter. How, how does that sound? 

00:29:05
SASHA Yeah. 

00:29:05
WENDY You'd be happy to come back, and maybe with your dad, as well? (crosstalk)You said his... 

00:29:10
JAMES (crosstalk)You know, we'll, you know, we'll try it, you know? But, I don't know. I know what he like, (inaudible ). 

00:29:16
WENDY Hmm. Well, I guess both you and your dad made a deal, maybe it's time to make another deal. We'll come back if you come back, and we all come (crosstalk)together, perhaps. 

00:29:25
JAMES (crosstalk)Hmm. 

00:29:25
SASHA (inaudible ) 

00:29:28
WENDY But, you know, maybe this is a healing time, now that you mob have come and your dad's come in and he's worried about you, and you mob worried about him. Maybe this is a chance that we can all get together and start looking at some of these things and, who knows? It could be, sort of, a, a change for all of you in your family life. The beginnings of one. A lot of work to go yet, of course, cuz there's a lot of things that need to be discussed here, and talked about. So how do you both feel about that? 

00:29:55
SASHA It'd be good. 

00:29:55
WENDY Be good? (crosstalk)Yeah? 

00:29:55
SASHA (crosstalk)If he'd come. 

00:30:00
WENDY If he comes, yeah? (crosstalk)And you think so too, James? 

00:30:00
JAMES (crosstalk)We'll, we'll, we'll try. 

00:30:00
WENDY Okay. Well, why don't we give that a go, then? And we'll organize something, a time when you can come back, and maybe even bring your mom too; you think mom would be interested in coming, as well? 

00:30:10
SASHA She'd come. 

00:30:15
JAMES Yeah, (crosstalk)well, she'd come along 

00:30:15
WENDY (crosstalk)Yep? Okay. 

00:30:15
JAMES If, if we ask her. 

00:30:20

"It's getting that I'm losing them" 

00:30:20
Setting the Scene 

00:30:30
WENDY Hello, everyone. Look, I think it's fantastic that you've all come along here together this morning. I really do think that, that sort of (inaudible ) if you like, just for the fact that you've all, you know, talked about this, obviously, and decided to all come in together. 

00:30:40
JAMES Hmm. 

00:30:45
WENDY Good to see you again, Thomas. The kids did come along, under your advisement, a (crosstalk)couple of weeks ago. 

00:30:45
THOMAS (crosstalk)Hmm. 

00:30:50
WENDY It's great that they came along. And, um, we talked a little bit about, perhaps, your wife coming along, as well, but... 

00:30:55
THOMAS Yeah, she was gonna come, but, um, the youngest fella there, Steven, (crosstalk)he had an asthma attack early this morning, so, yeah, we had to rush him up to the hospital. 

00:31:05
WENDY (crosstalk)Right. Oh, that's no good. Oh, that's no good at all. 

00:31:05
THOMAS So he's, yeah, (crosstalk)he's in the hospital, so... 

00:31:10
WENDY (crosstalk)Okay. Oh well, um, maybe she can join us at a, a later stage, then, (crosstalk)if we, you know, continue. 

00:31:15
THOMAS (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:31:15
WENDY Um, you're quite clearly, from my perspective, having talked to all of you now, that you very much all care about each other a lot, and I guess, you know, that's the great thing about our fellows, (crosstalk)it's sort of that aboriginal sort of fam... 

00:31:30
THOMAS (crosstalk)Well, they're my kids. 

00:31:30
WENDY Exactly. That, you know, that, those aboriginal families really do very much try to support and stick together, but obviously, there's, you know, talking to the kids last time, and, and your concerns that you shared with me last time, too, that there's been things going on that worry all of you a little bit, and I think it might be really good that, today, that we, perhaps, share some of those things, and letting each person have their little say and have their little talk, you know, okay? And then, each one will have an opportunity, and, and then we'll, we'll see where we can actually take this to, okay? 

00:32:10
[music] 

00:32:10
Understanding the Shame 

00:32:10
WENDY Sasha, maybe we'd like to start with you. Now, you wanna talk a little bit about some of the concerns that you've had and some of the things, perhaps, we talked about before that was worrying and sort of troubling you. 

00:32:20
SASHA Mmhmm. 

00:32:20
WENDY So dad can hear some of those things. 

00:32:25
SASHA Well, he makes us feel shame. 

00:32:30
WENDY (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:32:30
SASHA (crosstalk)Cuz when he's charging up and he does stupid things and everyone knows. 

00:32:35
WENDY Do you wanna tell a little bit more, there? Makes you feel shame, and, when he's been charging up, and then (crosstalk)that makes you feel a bit shame? 

00:32:40
SASHA (crosstalk)Mmm. Yeah. 

00:32:40
WENDY Mmm. 

00:32:45
SASHA And sometimes, when he angry, he'll hurt me. 

00:32:45
WENDY Okay. (crosstalk)Can you talk a little... 

00:32:45
SASHA (crosstalk)And I get scared. 

00:32:50
WENDY You get scared, okay. All right then, so, tell me, Thomas, how does that make you feel, to hear that story? 

00:33:00
THOMAS Not good. 

00:33:00
WENDY Mmhmm. 

00:33:00
THOMAS I didn't realize that affected her like that. 

00:33:00
WENDY Right, okay. That's the first time she's ever really sort of had a yarn with you about that? 

00:33:10
THOMAS Mmm. 

00:33:10
WENDY Mmm. 

00:33:10
THOMAS I realize I got real angry that time about the ganja. 

00:33:15
WENDY Mmm. (crosstalk)(inaudible ) 

00:33:18
THOMAS (crosstalk)But I was only trying to... mmm. 

00:33:20
JAMES (inaudible ) You know, you're in a bad mood every time you get a hangover, you know? When you're drinking? 

00:33:30
WENDY Okay, James, well, well Sasha shared some of where she's at, in terms of her concerns about, you know, dad's drinking. Maybe you could share some of your concerns, now. I can see (crosstalk)it's hard to, it's difficult this, I know it is. 

00:33:45
JAMES (crosstalk)(inaudible ) 

00:33:46
WENDY But it's, you know, it's good that we can share some of (crosstalk)this stuff. 

00:33:50
THOMAS (crosstalk)Come on, we gotta talk about it. 

00:33:50
JAMES (crosstalk)How you, you're supposed to be our father, but, you know, you make us shame. You drink that much, you know? I don't know, you remember when you come to football? 

00:34:05
THOMAS Yeah. 

00:34:05
JAMES Are you still drunk, or what? 

00:34:10
THOMAS No, I remember. 

00:34:10
WENDY Mmm. 

00:34:10
THOMAS I was proud of you, that day. 

00:34:15
JAMES Nah. 

00:34:15
THOMAS I was only cheering for you. 

00:34:20
JAMES (ph)Here to make us shame, you know? With everybody looking at us? What do we gotta do, proud of our drunken father. 

00:34:30
THOMAS Well, I only come there because I never seen you play before, and I wanted to be there for (crosstalk)you when you had a game. 

00:34:35
JAMES (crosstalk)Yeah, you'd see us if you wasn't drunk all the time. 

00:34:40
WENDY Mmm. 

00:34:40
THOMAS I only sing out and on the sideline there for my J Boy, that's all. 

00:34:40
JAMES Why'd you wanna sing out like that? Gotta sing out in front of everybody? 

00:34:45
WENDY Mmm. 

00:34:50
JAMES You know, look at yourself, what you look like, you know? How you think that make us feel? 

00:34:55
THOMAS I was only being proud for you. 

00:34:55
JAMES And what for us? What we got to be proud of? 

00:35:05

00:35:05
Summing Up: Exploring Hopes 

00:35:05
WENDY Basically, you know, what, I'm just gonna sort of talk a bit about what we've said so far. I mean, it's quite clear that you all really care for each other and I think you've really shown each other that in this session. Sasha, it's clear that, for me that you've, you know, you, you feel shame when dad's been drinking, and that certainly you sometimes get a little bit frightened and worried because you're frightened you might get hurt. Um, James, you're very clearly a bit cross with dad as well, because he make you feel shame when he's been drinking as well. And you're obviously really concerned because you've got Sasha there smoking a bit of ganja and you're worried about that, and, um, you know, you can see her talents as a netballer of the future and, you know, you, also acknowledging that James isn't around anymore, he's always off with his cousins drinking, anyway. So, (crosstalk)I mean, there's things going on here for you as a family. 

00:36:00
THOMAS (crosstalk)Hmm. 

00:36:05
WENDY Where would you like to go with this? What do you think we can do about this? Sasha, can you just tell me a little bit what you'd like to see happen from here? 

00:36:10
SASHA I'd like to see dad more sober. 

00:36:15
WENDY All right. Okay. (crosstalk)James? Sorry. 

00:36:15
SASHA (crosstalk)(inaudible )Come to some netball games? He never been to any. 

00:36:20
WENDY All right. Mmhmm. James, what would you like to see come out of this? 

00:36:25
JAMES I'd like to see him sober, you know? 

00:36:25
WENDY Mmm. 

00:36:30
JAMES I'nno when the last time, when I seen him sober, where we would go and do something. 

00:36:35
WENDY All right. 

00:36:35
JAMES Only time I get to see him, if I see him in the pub drunk and what. 

00:36:40
WENDY So I guess today's really positive because you're all here today, and you're all sober, aren't you? So, that's probably, it's a great step, isn't it? Cuz you are actually all (crosstalk)doing something together today. 

00:36:45
JAMES (crosstalk)Mmm. 

00:36:50
WENDY Thomas, what would you like to see? 

00:36:50
THOMAS Well, I seen all the trouble this is, grog's given me and my family, so... 

00:36:55
WENDY Hmm. 

00:36:55
THOMAS Gonna try and give it up. 

00:37:00
WENDY Okay. Well, I think, you know, what would be (crosstalk)really good... 

00:37:05
THOMAS (crosstalk)But, I need some support, too, from (inaudible ). 

00:37:07
WENDY And I think that's a really good point that, you know, dad needs your support as, as you mob need his support (crosstalk)as well. 

00:37:10
THOMAS (crosstalk)I don't wanna lose them, and I think I'm, it's getting that way that I'm losing them. 

00:37:20
WENDY Okay. And you don't wanna see that happen. (crosstalk)And it's very clear that the kids don't wanna lose their dad, either. 

00:37:25
THOMAS (crosstalk)Mmm.
