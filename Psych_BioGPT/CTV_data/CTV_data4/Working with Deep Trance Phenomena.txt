Working with Deep Trance Phenomena 

00:00:25
Dan Short, PhD 

00:00:30
DAN SHORT The room is full and it's about time to start. So I'll go ahead and welcome each of you uh… happy to have you here uh… for this demonstration of deep trance phenomena. And I have brought to the stage two different volunteers. Uh… and if you can say your name. 

00:00:50
MARIANA Mariana. 

00:00:55
DAN SHORT Aha and, and Solomon and uh… could you tell us why you wanted to come up here? 

00:01:00
MARIANA Yeah umm… I'm feeling a little bit stuck. Umm… like I'm moving, I know that I'm moving, I'm doing my things but I feel like I'm stuck when I'm with a patient for instance with a client, I feel like, oh, my God I'm not doing right. Everything is wrong and then I start to think this catastrophic things you know. Umm… and criticizing things and over analyzing and then when I realize I'm just stuck and my head hurts and… 

00:01:30
DAN SHORT Okay. 

00:01:35
MARIANA I feel like this. 

00:01:35
DAN SHORT Okay, all right. And then why did you want to come up here? 

00:01:40
SOLOMON Yeah, and I mean, like I'm pretty happy, my, my work is where I have these streams of sharing some other stuff I've discovered. I've been working with Freudsian and Ericksonian and then just feel it's far away and I feel sad about that. 

00:01:50
DAN SHORT Okay. 

00:01:55
SOLOMON I'm not sure how to proceed ultimately. 

00:02:00
DAN SHORT All right, all right so both of these individuals know what they want and uh… what I'm going to do is uh… treat the needs of the people that I'm working with as my primary concern. I consider hypnosis some what of a sort of a sacred thing uh… and part of, of protecting that sacredness is that I'm always orienting all of my energy towards protecting and meeting the needs of the person who's come up here uh… whether it's in my office or on the stage and volunteer themselves to do this. Uh… then as my secondary concern, it will be the learning uh… for the audience uh… and then my third and last concern would be uh… any of my own needs. Umm… as part of uh…being the audience you, you are going to be watching something and you are gonna be thinking about how is this relevant to me and how and am I watching you relevant to my personal experience. You may or may not go into a deep trance, I don't know. Uh… if you're noticing these individuals when I ask them why they are here uh… and I was trying to hear what they want, neither of my volunteers said, I want to experience deep trance phenomena. Great, so it's just a little something in the back of my mind. Umm… I can't promise you therefore especially since hypnosis is not about controlling people all right. Hypnosis like Ericksonian hypnosis is about activating things within the individual and working collaboratively, collaboratively with an individual. So because I'm not, I can create a process. I'm not, I'm not seeking to control what happens. So I can't promise you uh… what you will see but I can guarantee you that you will see a therapist being very attentive to the needs of the people he's working with and striving to make it as useful an experience as possible and that you as the audience have full permission to take whatever you wish from this for yourself and uh… use it. And so uh… to begin with uh… do you have a favorite means of going into trance? 

00:04:20
MARIANA Umm… no. 

00:04:20
DAN SHORT No. Okay. And what happens if I just take, let it go, take your hand and put it like that and you watch it. That's right and let's see if your eyes decide to stay focused on your hand or if they go close on their own. Either way, it doesn't really matter. Now both of you can go into a very nice trance quicker than you thought. There is a lot of important work that you came up here to do today, has great relevance for you and for your future. And certainly there are things that you consciously know that you want and even more that you're not yet consciously aware of that you can do. That's right, as you should into a certain mental space where you can really do some good work. 

00:05:40
[sil.] 

00:05:45
DAN SHORT And you don't have to have your eyes closed. You don't have to hear my voice. 

00:05:55
[sil.] 

00:06:00
DAN SHORT There is a lot you can do on your own with your own knowledge of yourself using this opportunity, using this time and time can move quickly or slowly. A lifetime of experience can be viewed and reviewed within just a few moments. 

00:06:35
[sil.] 

00:06:40
DAN SHORT Or if you're studying something really important, something you really need to know about. 

00:06:50
[sil.] 

00:06:55
DAN SHORT And in just a few minutes and move slowly as a full day or a week or a month. You see with hypnosis, we have so many options. Anything can happen. And your imagination can really work for you. 

00:07:20
[sil.] 

00:07:30
DAN SHORT And that becomes is what's of primary importance. My job is to be here looking after your safety, caring for you, making certain nothing from the outside world interferes with what you're doing. I will be very diligent in doing my work. The job of your unconscious is to do what it does best. And that's to really help evolve you as an individual, your future, this present moment even your part can change as you come to new understanding of what things have meant for yourself, for other people. Whether it was love, at first you didn't recognize this love. Things you've done really deserve approval. Not only from yourself but from others because it represented good effort on your part and good intention. 

00:08:55
[sil.] 

00:09:20
DAN SHORT And I'm gonna suggest for your benefit that you can either see, hear, smell or maybe even touch something. Something important. And this can be very real. And it will be very interesting to come to an understanding why this is so important? What this means? There it is, very real for you. Now you know why you came on this stage. You came on this stage for a specific purpose. Now you're experiencing this. 

00:10:25
[sil.] 

00:10:35
DAN SHORT And when I touch your hand you can wake up very nicely from the neck up and tell me how things are going for you now. 

00:10:50
MARIANA I'm okay. 

00:10:50
DAN SHORT You gave me a nice beautiful smile. Yeah. And your, your eyes have the look of joy. 

00:10:55
MARIANA Yeah. 

00:11:00
DAN SHORT Do you know why you feel so much joy right now? 

00:11:00
MARIANA No. 

00:11:05
DAN SHORT Ye, no. But it's very real, yeah? 

00:11:05
MARIANA Yes. 

00:11:05
DAN SHORT That's important. It's very important and being able to feel joy uh… while you do uh… what you consider important and meaningful work. Yes, you're going back into a trance again, you must like it. Yes, do you, do you like having your eyes open or closed? 

00:11:30
MARIANA I don't know. 

00:11:35
DAN SHORT You don't know. Can you tell me what you were experiencing early? 

00:11:40
MARIANA Umm… no. 

00:11:40
DAN SHORT No. You don't remember. 

00:11:45
MARIANA I don't know. 

00:11:45
DAN SHORT You don't know. Okay. I'm certain it was important. Yes. It's all right. You'll remember when the time is right. It will come to you. Yes. In the meantime know that you're well cared for. All right. Now, that's right. Let's see what happens, 

00:12:20
[sil.] 

00:12:25
DAN SHORT If I touch your hand once more, what happens next? More joy. That's beautiful. Yes, now I know where your joy button is. Wonderful. Very good. Okay. I'm gonna have you close your eyes again and go back into a sleep like state. There you go. So you can have a nice hypnotic dream. Something significant. Something that tells you something new about yourself. There is a lot we can discover through dreams. And how is this experience for you? 

00:13:20
SOLOMON Very relaxing. 

00:13:25
DAN SHORT Very relaxing. Is it meeting your needs? 

00:13:25
SOLOMON Yeah, I, I felt like umm… you're taking my life seriously. 

00:13:30
DAN SHORT Yes. 

00:13:30
SOLOMON And I was… 

00:13:30
DAN SHORT I am taking your life seriously. And is there anyway I can do my job better right now that you can think of. Anything, you can tell me that would make this experience more meaningful for you. 

00:13:50
SOLOMON I can't think of anything right now. 

00:13:50
DAN SHORT And I can't think of anything right now. And is there a specific thing that you would like to experience that you have not yet experienced that you wanted to experience on this stage? 

00:14:00
SOLOMON I am very open. 

00:14:05
DAN SHORT You are very open. Okay. And would you like to experience uh… hand levitation? You would? All right. And let's see which hand starts to levitate first. I'll watch. I don't know if I'll be able to tell before you do. You'll be the one that experience the lightness, the sensation of lightness. I'll be able to see a small movement and then I can make a guess that which hand it will be. 

00:14:40
[sil.] 

00:14:45
DAN SHORT That's right, that's right. Let's see, which hand it is. There we go. The fingers start to levitate first. They are super light. Then eventually other parts of the hand start to levitate. Yes. That's right. Lifting up with each breath, you take, becoming lighter and lighter. 

00:15:30
[sil.] 

00:15:35
DAN SHORT There is a part of you would really like your hand to lift. Otherwise, you wouldn't consent it. You said, yes and you said you would like the levitation to experience it and there maybe another part of you that doesn't want the hand to lift, I don't know. If there is, you can put that part of you in one hand and keep it very firmly in place showing your strength so much so that if I try to lift your hand, I will be unable and then the other part of you that wants to experience a hand floating in the air, that piece of you can be in the other hand. And so while one hand refuses to lift, the other hand can lift in the air all by itself. 

00:16:45
[sil.] 

00:16:50
DAN SHORT That's right. 

00:16:55
[sil.] 

00:17:00
DAN SHORT All by itself. And you can imagine this happening, can you not? Yes, very good. Already, you have your head levitated in the air, floating easily, effortlessly. Your eyelids also could remain up in the air without any effort or strength, all day if needed. They can close that's right. They can close all the way, very good. And you maybe doing better work than you realize. In this experience, it maybe more meaningful for you and you realize at this moment. And of course, whatever experience or skill I have in hypnosis, I do not have the ability to read minds. I do not have ability to tell the future. I would like to offer you just the right suggestion. The one statement that by hearing this, it changes the course of your life in a direction that you deeply desire. Well, you just needed to nudge or some form of outside validation. I would love to provide that statement for you, that experience, that image. But without magical ability, there is no way, I can do it for certain. What I do know, you have an unconscious mind. I do know that your unconscious mind is focused on your well-being, on your growth, on your healing, on your future achievements. And I do know that your unconscious mind can pick up anywhere where I leave off. So it is not necessary for me to say just the right thing. I experience myself, the same thing yesterday. We were practicing hypnosis and I had someone doing an induction for me and I was very eager to use the experience to go back in time. So I could work on some things with a parent. With a parent of mine that's no longer living. And was wishing for this person that asked me what I wanted, what I needed. It didn't occur to the person, they were doing their very best to help me. They really wanted to give me something special. They were going in a different direction. So half of my mind complied followed with what the person was saying and another small piece of me was doing my own hypnotic work. Just briefly, just two or three seconds of it. When the person uh… finished what they were seeking to help me to do, they were giving nice suggestions about me succeeding as a speaker, delivering a nice message, I certainly didn't mind hearing that. It was wonderful, it wasn't where my heart was at the moment. But it was a lovely message and I accepted it gladly. And then last night, I had a dream and in that dream, my parent so long ago sitting in front of me and talking to me. 

00:21:20
[sil.] 

00:21:25
DAN SHORT And I was overcome with emotion and with a sense of desperation and tears, I said, I thought it was already too late. I thought you had died and that I wouldn't be able to tell you, I love you and what you meant to me and whatever mistakes you made, I understand now as a parent myself. And I just appreciate all that you sought to do for me. And in my dream that parent of me and I was so happy that I got to do this before they die. 

00:22:05
[sil.] 

00:22:10
DAN SHORT When I woke the next morning, it took me a little bit to figure out what was the reality of the moment. Was the dream, a dream or was it the current reality? And I was explaining this to my young daughter and she said, you know, dad, it doesn't really matter. Maybe they are just something meant to be experienced at the level of the soul. 

00:22:40
[sil.] 

00:22:45
DAN SHORT Now you coming up here on stage, it represents two facts. One you're a person of sincerity and authenticity. You believe in what you do. And you're willing to be at both ends of doing it for others and at the receiving end. And think of no other thing that better prepares a person for this practice and the practice of using hypnosis to heal and grow and teach then to be authentic, to be willing, to be at the receiving end and to really use it for yourself. I hope everyone in the audience is just as willing. It shows your courage and it shows your commitment by being up here in these chairs, you've made a physical commitment to doing something new, to moving further ahead in your life. It's an absolute certainty, it will happen. The only mystery is in what way, it will happen. That will be something for you to discover, something for your unconscious mind to give you as a gift. 

00:24:25
[sil.] 

00:24:35
DAN SHORT One last thing I'll say is that when you came up here, I did not have any expectations other than that I would do my best at my end to create a meaningful opportunity. Some experience that for you is extraordinary. Outside of what normally occurs for you. 

00:25:00
[sil.] 

00:25:05
DAN SHORT So that what's happening within your body and within your emotions and within your thoughts, both conscious and unconscious, can be rather extraordinary. Something outside of the norms, something you can really use as you move forward in life, taking on new challenges. 

00:25:25
UNKNOWN When working with each of them individually and then as you're working together, I was just wondering about that internal experience for you and what that was like? 

00:25:35
DAN SHORT Yes, I do my very best to go into trance whenever I'm working with people. Uh… I do my very best, if it's gonna be eye closure on my part, if their eyes are already closed before mine close. I try to make sure mine are open before theirs open because I don't want the person to freak out, right. Uh… so uh… I do believe it's important. Uh… the quote from Erickson which uh… I may not say precisely correctly but a nice quote. Uh… one of the books, I believe with Erick and Rossi was that uh… the unconscious is the manufacture, the conscious mind is the consumer and then the uh… trance is the mediator between the two. And so hinting along those lines, I like to think of trance as a way of getting something created in the unconscious whether it's perception, an insight, uh… a plan, maybe a goal even. It's a very insightful goal that my conscious mind didn't have yet. I can use trance, my own trance in order to get that from the unconscious to the conscious, so that I can act on it and use it in some way. And so uh… I, I do favor the idea. Also if I'm gonna do something. I prefer the idea of doing something with someone rather than doing something to someone. Uh… the idea of doing trance to someone was developed in the very earliest days with Mesmer, right and the idea that you had some sort of uh… energy in you, magnetic energy and you could make it come through your fingertips, you know and you could shoot it at the person and then they would have the convulsive crisis right and so you felt quite powerful because this person is having like an epileptic seizure in front of you because you, you did something to them. Uh… and I think with Ericksonian hypnosis, it can be quite the opposite way. uh… therapy itself is a collaborative effort uh… their unconscious mind has quite a few resources and abilities within it that I'm seeking to help the person tap into. My unconscious mind has quite a few resources and abilities which I'm seeking to tap into. So I'm doing hypnosis with the person not to them. 

00:27:50
UNKNOWN Thanks, umm… I'm just very interested in your process. I umm… these folks had something specific that they are interested in. Umm… and umm… so did I. I went into trance and I feel like benefited. But you're speaking umm… you know, in a general way guided by their goals and I'm just interested in what guided you to say what you said or to umm… great, you did. 

00:28:25
DAN SHORT Yes, fabulous question. Uh… what you saw me demonstrating with more so process of hypnosis rather than content of hypnosis. So I wasn't taking a specific. Now, if I wanted to, probably, if I wanted to go more into content, I would only have one person on stage so I can really focus on the content for that person and I would probably need to have more communication going on. So I would needed to have the person speaking to me. I needed to be asking them questions so that I make sure, I need a little bit of dialogue to make sure I'm going in the right direction. The more specific and concrete you are with a hypnosis, the more feedback, you know, you need in order to make sure you're, you know, you want the person to relax. A process suggestion would be, you can go somewhere relax and right, you can see the sights and sounds and all that. Content suggestion would be, you can go to the beach now and you can go closer and closer to the water. Right, maybe that's good for the person, maybe not, maybe then you really drowned when you were a kid. Maybe there was a shark attack when you were in the water, you know, right. I don't know other than what I can observe non-verbally but it's, it's nice as you're doing more specific and concrete you are, the more I believe, you should get feedback from the person. But with process, uh… uh… we're just basically acknowledging the fact they came here for a specific purpose and something is happening and something rather than extraordinary and they are gonna use this experience to go in a certain direction in their future for learning or for health or for thriving and finding more happiness and joy in life. I don't need as much feedback while I'm doing that because they are filling in the blanks. Uh… Erickson, one of my favorite quotes from Erickson's statement, I don't need to know your problem in order for you to solve it. 

00:30:15
UNKNOWN So right, I don't remember what you said but you're speaking in a general way about umm… personal growth and trust in yourself and faith and etc., etc. So I wonder do you guys feel like your problem is, how do you feel about your problem that you came up with given what happened? 

00:30:40
SOLOMON Well, a lot of times, it's actually is an interesting moment where, where you said that you would have liked somebody to say a certain thing to you through the words. You can do it, came to me. And then I considered asking, then I realized, I don't need to ask him to say because it's as if you said it. 

00:30:55
DAN SHORT Yeah, yeah. 

00:30:55
SOLOMON And I said it. 

00:30:55
DAN SHORT And you realized, you can say it to yourself. I can do it. 

00:31:00
SOLOMON Yeah. 

00:31:00
DAN SHORT Which made it more meaningful. 

00:31:05
SOLOMON Yeah. So that was really close to heart. 

00:31:05
DAN SHORT That's awesome. 

00:31:10
MARIANA Umm… I felt like the problem was that, the problem is that I think too much. In doing the trance, I got myself not thinking and I start to worry about not think like oh, my God, I'm not thinking. But I could have start thinking, I was just too absorbed in what was going on and in my arms that's was interesting. 

00:31:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:31:40
MARIANA That was new. 

00:31:40
SOLOMON Another thing that happened was, it happened later on and maybe not wish, it wasn't time to end because I noticed my breathing completely was dictated by your speaking. Then I was really enjoying, enjoying that process. 

00:31:55
DAN SHORT So you were in deep rapport with me. 

00:32:00
SOLOMON Yeah. 

00:32:00
DAN SHORT Yes. Good, okay. 

00:32:05
UNKNOWN I have a deep and relaxing trance. Okay. I have a deep and relaxing trance myself and I thank you for that. A question when you woke from, uh… from the neck up 

00:32:15
DAN SHORT Yes. 

00:32:20
UNKNOWN Was that to check in with them or to help them go deeper or what? 

00:32:25
DAN SHORT Right, well uh… uh… the honest uh… and humble answer I can give you is uh… I did it because I know Erickson did it and uh… it occurred to me to do it. Uh… that would be the most honest answer, I think. Umm… when I'm, when I'm working with someone I try to when some thing suddenly occurs to me whether it's to do levitation or to touch the hand or to anything what certainly occurs to me, I'm assuming my unconscious mind is on to something that I don't consciously have totally figured out and usually that thing is rather important and if the person doesn't immediately upon waking say, it's so weird that you did this or I can't believe you said, this. Right there are a lot times that's what will happen. Uh… if it doesn't happen immediately uh… sometimes it will happen by the next time I see them and I'll be explaining, I couldn't get out of my head when we were in session and we did this and it's, it's nice often that I do that thing just doing normal social ordinary dialogue. Usually, it's when I'm doing hypnosis, the person is in trance, I'm in trance, probably we're synced in ways that I'm not even fully consciously aware of and there is more to call it inner personal intuition or if you want to call it just unconscious observation of what's going on. Maybe there is even some uh… not only micro expression even the face as far as umm… emotion. There might be micro vocalization going on with their throat and some part of your unconscious mind is able to see the words that's, that's being expressed in the throat. And somehow you're guided to some thing and to mention something you have no way of consciously figuring it out. Right but the unconscious mind can pick up on so much more. We create the opportunity when you seek to someone and utilize this resource within yourself. Now sometimes there is a thing that can interfere with this a little bit. It's not that just because something automatically comes to you, it's perfect. Right uh… if you, if you struggle with narcissistic fantasies as I have at sometimes in my life. I can get the idea that uh… you know, just because it came to me, it's right and good. It's not always the case, right where you have a desire to be really insightful and so you say, well, this thing, you know, it comes up and it's just long. So, it's not because that the anything it's automatic, it's always right. Uh… uh… we need to check in with ourselves and be very aware of what our ego needs are and what's going on inside of ourselves. Whether or not during therapy work, we may be able to put ourselves aside and put our ego aside and not to be good observers, to be less consumed and more consumed in the people who's needs you are seeking to serve at the moment. Uh… you also have what they call the promise effect uh… which will make things come to you automatically. It comes from the unconscious, it's not, I wouldn't call this necessarily though a resultant insight as much and there was an example of a promising effect in my work up here on stage. Uh… it was when I was talking about a dream I just had last night. Right, within a conversation I just had with my daughter this morning. I would be less inclined to believe that, that little story for sure really was targeted on something going on when it's two individuals because it's just something that's in my subconscious just from recent. It's gonna be something that comes to mind automatically because it's recent. Uh… however uh… when one, one that wouldn't go away. So it's interfering is what I was trying to do because it was just sticking around in my head. Two, uh… I was seeing this as a nice little story that if I stated in just the right way, it could be useful sort of that anyone hearing it. Whether it's the two people in front of me, the audience, or someone listening to the tape ten years from now. If I word it in just such a way, I think this can be useful. We all have mothers and fathers. I didn't say witch. We also have some healing. It needs to go on around mom and dad whether or not they really loved us or approved of us. It's kind of a universal thing. So that's another umm…, that's another thing you can do that used to, in the world of testing, they call, especially with umm… you know testing and interpretation of results that the aunt fanny effect where uh… what you're saying is so universal, the person is gonna believe what you're saying is very applicable to them personally as if you read their mind. But this can be true almost any person. Uh… and so uh… best example, I can think of is kind of young and kind of cocky? And I was being trained in the (inaudible ) by just by an expert and they had a six, six of us they said, what we are doing is we're gonna give you the inkblots and you're gonna see what was circled. You're gonna hear the responses, you got to score this thing using the formulas. Right and so the person left in the room and so everyone started, you know like oh my God, you know, they are trying to do the formulas and all that. I just started writing my narrative and I wrote a full page narrative and they were like, what are you doing? I was like, well, I'm writing the test results and they were like you haven't scored it yet, how can you do that? I was like, oh, just wait and see. And so uh… the person came back in after a while. I finished writing my narrative very early on. I'm just sitting and enjoying myself and the person started reading through the different uh… tests that have been scored and she uh… she said okay, uh… this is a real person that I worked with and of all these reports, there is one person who absolutely nailed this individual personality and I want to talk about this so you can understand how useful this test is and how much you can get about a person. Dan Short for somehow was able to nail what was going on with this girl and what… And so she started reading the whole thing and everyone else in the room was just going. Right, I knew, I knew the girl was an eight grader. I knew she was a female. I knew she had come to the school psychologist for help for something and then everything else was universals that would apply. Right. And so the same thing, you can do the same thing with working with people with trance and with hypnosis, you just need to know about human need in general. Uh… and how the unconscious mind works, how the heart works, how relationships work, how your personal relationships work and the person will take it and you know, you know, they'll, they'll use it in a way that's just right for them. And then I threw in that other little clause about, what I call an escape clause or what. But about not being perfect and it's possible that I can say something that doesn't quite meet your needs but that your unconscious mind can do it, it works and it can fill in, right so you, you put in a few statements like that. Uh… or if you are working with these individuals uh… had a certain confidence to them, at a certain eagerness to come up on, on stage, it was striking me as individuals are gonna be easily uh… they distract me fragile with people dealing with trauma. But if you're working with a client who's further fragile dealing with trauma uh… uh… one of the nice clauses to put in even before you do the hypnosis is of course, you can awake at any moment. Of course, you only go as deep as is right for you. Right and so you're putting in some of these safety hatches, if you will. Uh… so the person uh… you know expectation has a whole lot to do with results. And so you created an expectation of safety and a personal empowerment and an ability to tear care of themselves. An important part of it. Umm… I, I didn't do too much. I've come to other demonstrations and maybe they are, they are better. They are more like stage hypnosis where the person is having someone picking the apples out of a tree and tell them how wonderful it is and they don't remember what's going on. I've seen those things happen and they are really amazing and I think for the most part in a training when you're watching that kind of thing occur for one how those individuals are picked typically is you'll have, you know something done with the audiences as a whole and you'll see who is highly suggestible and you'll pull that you know, two or three people out of a hundred. You pull them up on the stage and you can do some really entertaining things. However this is for, we're, we're here to learn for clinical reasons or for reasons of teaching and growing average individuals and average individuals don't respond to hypnosis that way. And plus uh… this isn't being done for entertainment. Uh… this is being done uh… for, for real and serious reasons to meet the needs of an individual or a person sitting right in front of me or maybe the needs of an audience. So I tend to not go in the direction of show as much. What I am trying because, frankly and it's, it's more safe in here. These individuals can do more. I think like hers to get arm and then make her tickling with my fingers. I was curious to try that out. I tried to change, like to do that when he was wanting to increase circulation in his patients and so he blew up the important part of using hypnosis for physical health and I thought, on stage it would be a nice closer view because it's safe. You're not gonna do as much if you're alone in a room especially alone in a room with a female. Uh… you are more careful about touch and more careful about uh… whether or not the person has suggestion for amnesia or what not because uh… they need to know it's safe with an audience, a room, a video camera and all that. And this is absolute certainty, I'm not gonna do anything nefarious. So you can do more in stage than you can do while you're alone with a person and an audience. We're trying to replicate more so mostly what we, what each of us would be doing with an audience working with women in office working with someone. So you're, you're not wanting to freak out the patient. Uh… you're not wanting to think, oh my God, you know, oh my God. Uh… uh… what I am seeking to do though is create an extraordinary experience. I want the experience to be something more than what they normally encounter because if the experience is not something more than they want to encounter, then uh… then they would just be here talking with people and going out about their normal, their normal business. All they have to do is think about your problem and just do their day and everything will be fine. But they have been thinking about their problem and they have been doing their normal day and everything isn't fine. So they need some extraordinary experience. Now, extraordinary experience doesn't have to be on catalepsy and your eyes closed and breathing really slowly or your body totally still. Uh… it can even be cussing at the therapist. I remember one of my favorite uh… instances of being cussed out uh… was when a woman came in and said, you know, I think it's a pretty sorry thing what you did doctor Short and uh… uh… squeeze my French but God damn it, I didn't come here for something, something, something. And I said uh… what is it, I did this last session? And she said, well, you told me uh… stop murmuring and I'll have you know, I've been in therapy ever since I was a teen and I've been working very hard to find my voice and uh… uh… I've had so much abuse that I've encountered, especially from males and to be subjugated this way and tell me, for someone to tell me to stop murmuring is, I believe uh… you know uncalled for and she was very angry. And I think she said, you know, a couple of cuss words. And uh… I said I do not remember saying that but certainly that is not an okay thing to say. No therapist should ever tell its patient to stop murmuring and you have been working hard to find your voice and uh… you did come through a lot and I just want to acknowledge the courage, one for you to returning to therapy. I want to acknowledge that and uh… uh… say that I think this is a good and bold thing. You've done, to be honestly in telling me, how this affected you. I want to congratulate you. And then kind of blushed and she said, Dr. Short with you it's easy. I was like, no, this is the beginning of, I should have said no. Uh… she said, yes, yes and this is the beginning of uh… you uh… learning more about asserting and this is wonderful that you're able to come in here and assert yourself with me. So well, yes you found your voice. And she, she was quiet for a second. She just kind of looking, reviewing things and she said, you know, the more I think about it, it doesn't really sound like the way, you talk. You know, now that I really think about it, it was something my mother would always say to me. I'm not for sure, you even said it. Well, I recorded my sessions. I listen to it. I hadn't said it. But this, this was an opportunity, this was an extraordinary experience for her to be able to take on to a male doctor, an authority figure like that and put him on in his place and be responding to with kindness and acceptance and a validation and looking for her safety. That was an extraordinary experience. You know, everyone would call that hypnosis. Certainly if people outside of Ericksonian realm wouldn't call that hypnosis. In my mind, certainly, we had an altered state of reality for her and uh… an important therapeutic moment, I would call it an extraordinary experience. Okay umm… we still have ten minutes. Umm… uh… how about we do a little bit more hypnosis? Okay, yeah. 

00:46:00
UNKNOWN So I was absolutely struck by your transparency, the directness. One illustrated, once when uh… uh… you uh… talked about the, the beautiful smile and the recessive directness. So but as you were hoping for them to have the extraordinary experience, I was wondering, so you got the arm up there and that was extraordinary but then with Solomon, he didn't raise his arm. So I was wondering, so pushing you on your further on your transparency, I guess but I was, I'm wondering if, if there was part of you that was disappointed? 

00:46:40
DAN SHORT No. This is what I hoped for. I hoped that we would have one person that would respond to suggestion in ways, we could see as an audience and I hoped that I had one person who would not respond at least not on the outside where we can see. I had every expectation that this individual use this trance and did quite a bit of work for himself in his own way in a way that is right for him. I did make, I didn't just give up on it straight away. Uh… a lot of people will be ambivalent uh… uh… when they come to you for hypnosis. Uh… I was guessing that Solomon would be ambivalent because he came to me and he says, it's too late to be uh… a subject. So I knew already a part of him, it kind of was waiting to maybe it was too late. So a part of him whereas this individual grabbed me at lunch, right. She was not gonna let anyone be her to the stage, right. So I knew her arm would go up, right. Solomon asked me if it was too late yet, he through him that yet, he was kind of hesitant even though he speak, I said no, no, it's not too late. Right and so I'm looking individuals up. I find this individual very easily. I can't find him. And I'm asking her, have you seen, have you seen my other volunteer? She can't find him. No one can find him. He's lost, he's left the room. Now, I've had this happen with patients before where they tell me, they want hypnosis and I'm saying, are you ready and they say, well, I think I'm gonna go to bathroom. Right and so we are not even 30 seconds into therapy and they've already left my office. Right, so I know they are ambivalent. I know there is a part of them that wants this, a part of them that doesn't want this. And then you did something else too that signaled me that you definitely wanted this but this but there was another part of you that wasn't certain. And you know, I'm blanking up. But it gave me two pretty good. He didn't do this but another good one is when the person says, okay, hypnotize me. And they cross their legs and they cross their arms, okay. So you should know, this person both wants to be hypnotized and doesn't want to be hypnotized. Now sometimes you can uh… sort of straddle ambivalent and you need to address both sides. You don't, there is not one side that's right and one side that's wrong. Both sides are legitimate and right and need to be dealt with or not dealt with. Addressed properly. Uh… and so uh… what I was seeking to do was try to put uh… half of this ambivalence in one end and half the other ambivalence in the other. So that one can stay down nice and solid and one could levitate right and then I would have explained you this nice little method of dealing with ambivalence. Uh… but that was not how it was to be. Right and so what he did was he found other methods. One is conscious. He was breathing in sync with my words and so that's how he was using the hypnosis. So he was definitely using it and he definitely has some important objectives. He's gonna do it and he has a way. Remember in that statement, realizing I can. Right. And you weren't up here on the stage to realize Dr. Short can. You didn't come up here to find out what can Dr. Short do to me. I doubt either of these individuals came up for that. Right what can I do? One of the things I can do is uh… I can have my own hypnotic experience and he can be suggesting a way of lift, lift, lift and my hand can stay on this leg. You can do that, right. It's a wonderful thing to uh… to discover. It's a very nice thing to discover. Even I got to see this person with her hand in the air, right. So he already sees and knows Dr. Short can levitate an arm in the air and it can stay there. Now he gets to find out if his arm can stay down even as Dr. Short suggest that it goes up. This is a nice learning opportunity. Right. Another possibility we could have done and it just uh… alone in the office is we could have done the whole hypnosis and open his eyes and say well I didn't really go into the trance. You know, and hypnosis didn't really work for me. I didn't feel a thing. And I can say, well, now that we got, got failure on my part out of the way, let's just do different work in therapy. And let's suggest what you came here to address and while we start talking as possibility spontaneously going to a trance or that you would certainly be very interested in what I'm doing. Right because we don't have a resistance. I'm not fighting against them. You need to be careful. Sometimes you can get caught up in control battles with patients when they come in and they give you half of their ambivalence. They are giving you half of they are consciously aware of. They can't give into the, I mean they can't tell you the part that I'm aware of right. So a woman comes in and she says, my boyfriend has been beating me and uh… my mom tells I should leave, my girlfriend tells me I should leave. The last to therapists I've had tell me I should leave. But for some reason, I just can't leave. Right and I need you to help me get out of this relationship. You are getting in a really terrible power struggle with this person, if you started working on and doing hypnosis to make her need the relationship. They are gonna get no where. They are just gonna get her more and more firmly entrenched and I need to stay, I love him and I'm not ready to leave. Uh… so you need to be, you need to be careful because if uh… you need to look at the overall situation to understand what the person's actions, what is their, what is their unconscious agenda or what are they doing with their body language. If they cross arms, they lean back and they say hypnotize me. You understand, there is two levels there. There is the part of them that wants hypnosis, there is a part of them doesn't want hypnosis. So you need to both, honestly work to succeed but you also need to fail too. They need to, they need to both experience it, not experience it. Another way of doing it, you can divide it up anyway. You could say, we'll do hypnosis this week and we'll do hypnosis next week. I doubt it, it's gonna work both times. I'm wondering whether or not it succeeds the first time and let it fail the first time and then the next time uh… it's probably gonna succeed because you address both sides of the ambivalence. We still got four minutes. Uh… you look very eager to ask a question. Okay go. 

00:52:55
UNKNOWN The question is, is it possible that it isn't about hemispheric issues or hypnosis itself but hard wiring of a motor area because you, you could feel he was right, was he, you were right with them everything was in sync and the one thing that you said was, it got heavy and I'm thinking that heaviness is the rebirth and I've seen that with medication. Some people have the reverse experience of them what the medication should do and it's the hard wiring or the way the brain is set that reversed and it was, it was going in the opposite direction of up that was going down. Maybe it's just upside down, you know. 

00:53:55
DAN SHORT Well, what I have found is with some individuals were unable to close their eyes, right or they are unable to uh… lift an arm. He's certainly able to lift an arm and certainly he's, he's automatically lifted an arm when he's got a bowl of cereal in front of him and he, he will not only automatically lift his arm, his mouth will automatically open. There will be lots of automatic behaviors. He's probably wired correctly. And his arm probably is capable of lifting. There is, there is not gonna be anything that occurs in hypnosis that is not a normal capability of ours in day-to-day interaction. We can forget things. We can see things that aren't there. We can go back in time. We can go forward in the future. We can go numb and not feel part of our body. We can forget that half of our body is there. Everything that happens in hypnosis happens in normal ordinary life. But it's not brought to bear all at once and focused on a specific intention of healing or learning or growing usually until we do hypnosis and so that's one of the benefits of it. I still have three minutes. I want to show everybody what a three minute hypnosis session looks like. And so let's have you both go back in a trance. The same way you were in. That's right, very good. And you know exactly how to do this and you know what to expect from me. And if there is anything left yet, anything left undone, anything that you are almost about to achieve, anything else you wanted for yourself and hadn't fully grasped, now is the time. Whether you're on stage, in the audience or watching a screen, now is the time. You can take this moment for yourself and to take it with you every where you go and whether it's my voice, the voice of Milton Erickson, the voice of other key people in your life or your own wise inner guide that voice can go with you, all the days of your life, every where you go, so it's there for you whenever you need it. Whenever you need to know what to do, how to handle a situation, how to meet a challenge, how to turn a problem into an opportunity, you have within you the resources you need and tonight as you sleep, you can sleep very deeply in a very profound way, these learning's from today can be consolidated, locked in, deep within the mind and as you dream, you can really take the ideas and apply them to all areas of your life. Far, far more than what the conscious mind can do or conceive of, that can happen for you, that is what will happen for you tonight. And it's been such a pleasure for me to be able to work with you.
