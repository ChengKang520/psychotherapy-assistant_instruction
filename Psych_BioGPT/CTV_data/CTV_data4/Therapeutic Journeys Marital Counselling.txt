Setting the Scene presenting the problem 

00:00:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay, so you signed the consent forms, which sort of outlines the basic confidentiality, my fees, and what happens in my sessions, etc. Um, but I guess I just want to explain that usually what I do when I work with a couple is to see you together and then I like to have at least one session on, on your own with me. So that I get a kind of feel for you as an individual and you can, may be there are things that you feel a little awkward saying in front of the other initially. Um, and it's important that you understand that what you tell me in those sessions is absolutely confidential unless you're willing for me to raise those issues in the next joint session we have. But predominately the sessions will be together. Does that sit comfortably with you, the kind of way of working? 

00:01:15
KAREN Yeah, I think that should be good. 

00:01:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, okay. Good. So, how come you two come on your day off are sitting here on my chairs, on what ever time it is, on Tuesday morning rather than having a coffee in the world. What is it that brings you here? 

00:01:35
KAREN It's basically, Richard's drug use. 

00:01:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:01:40
KAREN It's um, it sort of started as being sort of social not problematic use, but it's got, it's escalated to the point where may be just our lifestyle has changed. And now it's causing big problems in the business that we, that we own and in our relationship. 

00:02:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:02:00
KAREN And I just want him to stop. 

00:02:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, okay. Is that how you see it Richard. 

00:02:10
RICHARD Um, the more I hear about it, the more I consider it. I can of think um, there been uncomfortable moments. I mean life is difficult anyway. I'm not sure those difficulties wouldn't of occurred with drug use sometimes. 

00:02:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay, so you're not sure if we took the drug use out of the picture things would be completely Okay. 

00:02:35
RICHARD Well, something like that. I've minimized it or cut back a bit. 

00:02:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:02:35
RICHARD You know, there's still moments where it's difficult. 

00:02:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:02:40
RICHARD You know, who's to say it would be anyway, I don't know. 

00:02:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, okay. So, can you tell me a little bit more on how, I mean clearly it is a concern for you. Can you a little bit more about what worries you about, about your life together? That is, that is implicated in, in Richard's drug use. 

00:02:55
KAREN So many things. I don't know, I don't know were to start. 

00:03:00
SANDY WILLIAMS I um. 

00:03:00
KAREN In terms of our like relationship where we're going. I'd really like to start a family soon. 

00:03:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:03:10
KAREN And at the moment I feel like I'm carrying everything. I feel like I'm carrying the business. And I feel like I'm carrying the household stuff. 

00:03:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:03:15
> KAREN And it's primarily because he goes out on a binge and then like, he's not 20 anymore, you know. Like, we used to recover quickly when, but he goes out binging and this is like every weekend. And then it takes him days to recover. 

00:03:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:03:40
KAREN And so, I'm stuck doing all the house stuff. 

00:03:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:03:40
KAREN Carrying a business. 

00:03:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:03:45
KAREN And I just feel like, if he stopped then it would be even like it used to be. 

00:03:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Can, can I just ask you, how, how old, do you mind telling me how old you are? 

00:03:55
KAREN 30 

00:04:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm, and you Richard? 

00:04:00
RICHARD 32. 

00:04:00
SANDY WILLIAMS 32, all right. And what, and what kind of work do you do? 

00:04:05
KAREN We um, own a business. It's a cafe, a wine bar cafe. 

00:04:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:04:10
KAREN Cuz Richard's a chef and I got a background in accounting. So, we kind of, it was the right kind of business together. 

00:04:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:04:20
KAREN Uh. 

00:04:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, sounds perfect. But it's probably pretty hard work. I mean, my senses as a layman, um, in the, in the catering business it's pretty, it's a pretty hard life, pretty demanding, and exacting of you. 

00:04:30
KAREN It is pretty demanding. 

00:04:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:04:35
KAREN And that's why I kind of understand why he needs to sort of go out and let off steam and all that stuff. I do understand that. 

00:04:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay, so, you have a sense of needing to chill out from the pressures of it. And he's kind of doing it his way. 

00:04:50
KAREN Mmm. 

00:04:50
SANDY WILLIAMS But his way is impinging on, on, your, the quality of your life together. Is that, is that what you're saying? Yeah. 

00:04:55
KAREN Yep. 

00:04:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Does that, does that fit with you Richard? Is? 

00:05:05
RICHARD Uh, I don't know how to be without it. I mean I get, it does keep me going. 

00:05:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:05:10
RICHARD To, to take something. I have tremendous creative spurts. in my opinion, anyway. 

00:05:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:05:15
RICHARD And so. 

00:05:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Huh. What is it that? Do you mind me asking what it is that you're using? 

00:05:25
RICHARD Uh, coke if I can. 

00:05:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:05:25
RICHARD But um, speed sometimes, whatever. It's mainly, it's social really. 

00:05:35
KAREN Speed. 

00:05:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:05:35
RICHARD Yeah, yeah. 

00:05:35
SANDY WILLIAMS It's become?. 

00:05:35
KAREN Speed, whatever's going really. 

00:05:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay, yeah. So, is that, and you say it's social. It's not like so you can keep working? It's not like, to pump you up for work? It's more about how you chill out in the breaks that you have, is that it? 

00:05:50
RICHARD Yeah, yeah it is, but I do feel it keeps me going. But I don't during the week, I cut it back a bit. Perhaps like to. 

00:06:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:06:00
KAREN He doesn't use when he's working. Oh, that, I would just not , I, I think that would be grounds for. I couldn't handle that. 

00:06:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, right. Okay. So, so it's more, it's more about the impact on your relationship then? 

00:06:15
KAREN Mm, yes, but it's also because it takes him a while to recover and then. 

00:06:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:06:20
KAREN You know, he's got to do shifts at. I mean, we don't, we don't, we've got other people working for us, so we're not there all the time. 

00:06:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:06:25
KAREN We're there most of the time. 

00:06:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:06:30
KAREN When he's not on top of game after he's had a binge. 

00:06:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:06:35
KAREN Things fall behind. 

00:06:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Huh. 

00:06:35
KAREN Like things uh, don't look as good, he doesn't look as good. 

00:06:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:06:40
KAREN The food doesn't look as good. 

00:06:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Uh-huh. 

00:06:45
KAREN The house turns into disarray. When I'm worried about him then I can't do my job properly. 

00:06:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. And what, what is your role? 

00:06:55
KAREN Well, I kind of manage the, I manage the place and I manage the accounts, and kind of overall. 

00:07:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay, Okay. So you've got a kind of over reaching responsibility so, you kind of get a bird's eye view of everything. And when you would see him not up to speed, uh, pardon the pun, um, then that worries you. 

00:07:15
KAREN Mmm. 

00:07:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah? 

00:07:15
KAREN Yep. 

00:07:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:07:20
[music] 

00:07:20
Exploring Communication and Conflict 

00:07:20
SANDY WILLIAMS So, have, have you talked about this much together? 

00:07:30
RICHARD Well, we try to but it's just we, our points of view are a bit different, is all. 

00:07:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:07:40
RICHARD 'Cuz I uh, I just like to have to a weekend. I know I've had one. 

00:07:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:07:40
RICHARD And then for me, then the rest of the week looks good. 

00:07:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:07:45
RICHARD I'm committed to work, I'm quite happy too. That's how I see it. 

00:07:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:07:50
RICHARD But um, Karen doesn't see it like that. 

00:07:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:07:50
RICHARD And that bothers me that she doesn't and we fight about it. I like to. 

00:07:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:07:55
KAREN That, that's why we come to see you. 

00:07:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:07:55
KAREN Because we tried to talk about it and it just turns into me. He thinks I'm nagging him. 

00:08:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Oh. 

00:08:00
KAREN And having a go. 

00:08:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:08:05
KAREN He doesn't, he's got to a point where he doesn't listen to me anymore. 

00:08:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, and how, how do you set that up? Who, who starts the conversation and, and do you decide that you want to have a bit of a showdown about this? Or does it happen accidently? Or, how do it, how do it, these kind of fights happen? 

00:08:20
RICHARD Well, she does. I, I tend to avoid the discussions of it. 

00:08:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. So, it's Karen who initiates it. 

00:08:25
RICHARD Yeah. That's why she *** discussion anymore. 

00:08:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:08:30
KAREN It's. 

00:08:30
SANDY WILLIAMS But I imagine you kind of know it's lurking in the wings waiting and there's kind of a raising anxiety about of when, when she's going to have another go. And you're in the other wing going I, I need to bring this up again. It's not okay. 

00:08:45
KAREN It's usually yeah, I mean it's usually he starts up, you know. Like he'll do something just, yeah, no offense but you do something that I cannot, I just can't deal with. 

00:08:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. And, and you'll have a go at him there and then or will you store it up for? 

00:09:00
KAREN It depends how big a stuff up he's, if it's a big one then yeah. 

00:09:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:09:05
KAREN But if it's a small one I'll store it up and adding them up. 

00:09:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. Then you get a liitle of what's going on. 

00:09:15
RICHARD Yeah, yeah. 

00:09:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Can you tell me a bit more about how these discussions go? I mean, how does it go if I were a fly on the wall. What would be happening when you raise a concern? How does it go? 

00:09:30
KAREN Well, I mean the one that I'm thinking of, the recent one, was Father's Day. 

00:09:35
RICHARD Ah. 

00:09:35
KAREN When he, we were suppose to be taking our Dad's out and he, then he was like, sat at the table out of it all day, didn't say a word, couldn't eat because he'd been out the night before. 

00:09:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:09:45
KAREN And so, when we got home I didn't handle it that well. I just yelled. 

00:09:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:09:50
KAREN Basically. 

00:09:50
SANDY WILLIAMS And what was it that, that you were upset about? 

00:09:55
KAREN Well, because it was like the second time that he done it. He did it on his birthday as well. 

00:10:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:10:05
KAREN And I said to him as well, that if he did it again I would leave him. 

00:10:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. And the doing it again is like being wasted when there's something precious, something important on for you and you felt really let down. 

00:10:20
KAREN Yeah. And I feel, I guess it makes me feel unvalued. Like I feel like he doesn't value me or what I'm doing for him or for our families. 

00:10:25
SANDY WILLIAMS It feels personal in that, in that sense. 

00:10:30
KAREN Definitely. And when he goes out with his friends instead of coming home to me, it's the same thing. I feel like, oh, you know, what am I, chop liver, you know. 

00:10:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Oh, yeah, yeah. 

00:10:40
KAREN Why doesn't he want to be with me? 

00:10:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay, so you feel like you're at the end of the que? 

00:10:45
KAREN Mmm. 

00:10:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:10:45
KAREN Yep. 

00:10:45
SANDY WILLIAMS I imagine you want to say something about that. 

00:10:50
RICHARD Well, the thing with my friends just has it's own momentum. And that's sometimes when they say, "Yeah, let's go do this or whatever". I, I think all this isn't great timing but it's just to jump on some opportunities I guess. 

00:11:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:11:00
RICHARD It doesn't make things all that great at home but. 

00:11:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Huh, huh. So you get caught in the moment kind of? 

00:11:05
RICHARD Uh, yeah, with the, their energy dragging me along. 

00:11:10
SANDY WILLIAMS And is this usually kind of when you knock off work, when you finished your stink as? 

00:11:15
RICHARD It happens in the weekends but you know. 

00:11:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:11:20
RICHARD It can could be other spontaneous things, you know. 

00:11:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:11:20
RICHARD Uh, I just don't want to lose that sort of spontanaity is all. 

00:11:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. All right. And what, what do you think about Karen's um, telling you about how she felt on Father's Day and with, with your birthday? What, what's you take on it? 

00:11:35
RICHARD The thing is at the time I thought, ah, it's just, just a one off. But listing two things back to back there. 

00:11:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:11:45
RICHARD Uh, uh, has some impact on me, for truth me known. I couldn't uh, didn't know how to defend myself while we were discussing it. 

00:11:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:11:50
RICHARD But I thought, oh well what can I do and I wanted to back out of the discussion. But uh. 

00:11:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:11:55
RICHARD Hearing her say that makes me want to look into it a bit more. 

00:12:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So you don't like that it has this impact on her? 

00:12:00
RICHARD It doesn't sound to good at all, not right. I don't like, I can feel that she's upset. 

00:12:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:12:05
RICHARD Even right now. 

00:12:05
SANDY WILLIAMS So she says that she takes this, this, this somehow or other with you not valuing her or her not being important to you. What is it, what would you say to that? 

00:12:20
RICHARD Uh, well, I know that's not true and I thought she knew that's not true, but that's, things aren't that simply. I guess I had a bit of a simplistic take on it. 

00:12:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. So have you, have you said that to her or you? I mean have you said to him, what you just said to me, which is that I don't feel like I'm valued, I don't feel like I count. Have you said that to him or have not quite up to the detail of it? 

00:12:45
KAREN I don't know if I've actually said it like that. 

00:12:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:12:50
KAREN But I, I guess I'm more asking like why. Why? I'm always asking why are you doing this? 

00:12:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. 

00:12:55
KAREN But yeah, I don't know, I might have not actually said that to him. 

00:13:05
[music] 

00:13:05
Clarifying Communication having the conversation you need to have 

00:13:05
SANDY WILLIAMS And I wonder if you know, you're kind of getting the stuck on the why, which I fully understand. You know, you kind of, it's a puzzle to you. It makes sense to you when you got some precious time off that he chooses to be with you. But I imagine that if that's the way that you do it with you. You know, in, in a sense he's going to feel under the hammer and not be able to account for it in an adequate way. Often what happens in those situations is that bloaks shut down, mmm. They want to do a runner. They kind of know that they've been remiss in some way. They don't know how to account for themselves adequately. 

00:13:45
KAREN Yeah. 

00:13:45
SANDY WILLIAMS And generally women are a bit more articulate to these things too. It's a bit of a bugger but, you know, you probably know what I mean here. She can probably stitch you up with her words, she's articulate. She knows just what she wants to, to tell you. And you kind of feel like well I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't. Is that? 

00:14:05
RICHARD Yeah. 

00:14:05
SANDY WILLIAMS A bit of how it goes? 

00:14:10
RICHARD Yes, I've, there's probably some good things that come up in the discussions but I, I'm so worried about being locked into one, you know, that I might not hear. 

00:14:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:14:15
RICHARD Some of the positive things she says. 

00:14:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So, you, I think what you're saying is she's making some good points and that you kind of, you know, are along side of um, those things. But the process of having this kind of discussion is pretty painful. 

00:14:35
RICHARD Yeah. 

00:14:35
SANDY WILLIAMS And so you kind of do a runner on the inside or you protect yourself some way from this pretty unpleasant process. 

00:14:40
RICHARD Yeah. 

00:14:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Okay. So, when you hear him say that, you know, he actually sympathizes with some of the points that you're making, or he, he thinks that it's important to try to sort this out. What, what happens with you when you hear that? 

00:14:55
KAREN Well, it's a bit of relief actually. 

00:14:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:14:55
KAREN Because I didn't really understand that was why he didn't want to talk about it. 

00:15:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:15:05
KAREN I thought, I actually thought that he didn't want to talk about it because he doesn't care. 

00:15:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:15:10
KAREN About my feelings. 

00:15:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:15:10
KAREN That's the way I felt. 

00:15:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Then what's been different in last 10 minutes that we've been talking about this? Uh, uh, in terms of your belief that he doesn't care? 

00:15:25
KAREN Well, he just said that, he just said that you know, he valued me. 

00:15:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:15:30
KAREN Indirectly, but, but also just I understand now maybe that, I know that talking is the way to sort things out. 

00:15:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:15:40
KAREN But for him it's threatening. 

00:15:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, yeah. 

00:15:45
KAREN Which I, I never knew that. 

00:15:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. I think talking is the way to sort it out. But often couples are not having the conversation that they need to have, hmm. 

00:15:55
KAREN Mmm. 

00:15:55
SANDY WILLIAMS They kind of get stuck at a level up here and each tries to convince the other, you know, that their, that their truth, that their reality is it. And tries to drugoon(ph) the other to there, rather than trying to go down a layer or two and see just what's happening here where the conversation might be more effecitve. 

00:16:15
KAREN Mmm. 

00:16:15
SANDY WILLIAMS All right. So, so that's kind of what I would be wanting to do if we were to do some work together. Is to actually help you to have more of the kind of conversation that you need to have. Um, rather than getting stuck where you get kind of backed into a defensive corner where you want to do a runner. And you feel like he's escaping and doesn't want to hear and how is this ever going to be solved. 

00:16:45
[music] 

00:16:45
Giving the Clients Space to Explore Conflict 

00:16:45
SANDY WILLIAMS So, I'm aware that we've been having a conversation that's been quite polite. Now, I don't imagine that your fights look this polite, I imagine there's a bit more heat that gets generated when you're upset and you''re feeling like you're having to account for who you are. 

00:17:05
RICHARD Mmm. 

00:17:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm? And you're behavior? So, I, it would be helpful for me to know a bit more about what it is that gets the head of steam of each of you and how it looks when that's happening. 

00:17:15
KAREN Well, I just want him to stop using drugs. It's pretty simple to me, you know. 

00:17:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So you're give him that message loud and clear and he doesn't hear it. 

00:17:25
KAREN Basically. 

00:17:25
RICHARD Well, I just don't really know what I'm listening to when she says that. Because this is the same person who has asked me with the same mouth, you know, have you got anything, what are we doing tonight, and all that sort of, you know, she was chasing as much as I was. And suddenly she's snapped off. 

00:17:40
KAREN That was when we were 20, Richard. It's a bit different. Right now we've got responsibilities. We didn't have responsibilities then. You know, we were students, we were young. I mean, you know, we could recover quickly. Now it takes you a week to recover. That's why I stopped because it started to effect me. Like I could feel that I couldn't handle it like I used to and neither can you. Even though you think that you can but you can't. 

00:18:05
RICHARD Ah, it still, it's still all worth it for me I, I think. 

00:18:10
KAREN How can you say that when, what it's doing to us? I don't understand how yo u can say that. 

00:18:20
RICHARD I think you just signed off on having fun. It's not uh, you used to have such a good time. 

00:18:25
KAREN What's a good time about like being like, wire, like being all wired and being all wrung out for the next week so we can't run the business. I mean we shouldn't of bought a business if we wanted to just be irresponsible and not be grown-up. 

00:18:45
RICHARD I don't see it that way. We can do both things. It was always fine. 

00:18:45
KAREN But we can't. I mean it obvious that we can't because of the way that you respond like, it's not like your 20, you can't just recover in a day. You can't keep up your responsibilities. 

00:19:00
RICHARD Yeah, well yeah. I've fallen back, haven't I? 

00:19:05
KAREN How? I don't think you have. 

00:19:05
RICHARD It's only on the weekends, you know, mainly. 

00:19:10
KAREN We've tried, we've tried to stop, you know, we've tried, well he's, I, I did use to use myself. And, but I've stopped now and he's stopped as well. He's capable of stopping. You've stopped for weeks. I don't understand why you have to keep going back to it all the time. 

00:19:25
SANDY WILLIAMS No. 

00:19:25
KAREN Honestly. 

00:19:25
SANDY WILLIAMS So, so, what I'm picking up is that there's been a bit of a history where you did use together and the conditions were kind of fitted with the lifestyle. And it was a way that you relaxed together and had a bit of fun. Hmm? 

00:19:40
RICHARD Yeah. 

00:19:40
SANDY WILLIAMS But over time as your responsibilities occurred and you were getting older, you have pulled back from that. Hmm? And you feel like you actually want to be clean of drugs. And you mentioned earlier that you're approaching a point where you might want to have children. So that is another, another factor. But it's like for you, Richard, she's changed, you know. 

00:20:00
RICHARD Well. 

00:20:00
SANDY WILLIAMS The person that you used to be with is kind of not, not there in some ways. 

00:20:05
RICHARD No, it's mainly what have you done with my, my wife, sort of thing, some days. 

00:20:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, right. Okay 

00:20:10
RICHARD We just use to have such, such fun doing all that. And there were would seem to, we work so hard, I just think that any successful business people should be entitled to do drugs, I think on the weekend. 

00:20:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:20:20
RICHARD Because we're living well. 

00:20:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:20:20
RICHARD Or we're at that level. 

00:20:20
KAREN There's other ways to have fun, Richard. 

00:20:25
RICHARD Well, yeah. I, I have modified, just like on the weekends with my friends. I still want to see my friends, is all. 

00:20:35
SANDY WILLIAMS So, is this how it goes? Is this how when you, or does it, is this how it looks when you have uh, the conversations? 

00:20:40
KAREN Pretty much. 

00:20:45
RICHARD Yeah. A bit more jumping and screaming but it sounds pretty familiar. 

00:20:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay, yeah. 

00:20:45
KAREN The feelings the same. It's like talking to a brick wall. 

00:20:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. And your sense is that if he really, if you meant enough to him and what you wanted meant enough to him he would do more about this. He would actually move across to the position that you've, that you've taken. He would see it your way. 

00:21:05
KAREN Yes. 

00:21:05
SANDY WILLIAMS And there is a sense that because, if he cared enough he would do that and if not then some way or other he doesn't care enough. 

00:21:10
KAREN Yes. 

00:21:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah? And your what I'm hearing from you is earlier you were saying, you do care, you do value her. But you kind of conflicted because you get really wired at work, you want to chill out, you want to relax, you want to have some fun. And in some ways there's some kind of perhaps even sadness that you've lost the girl that you used to have. Hmm? 

00:21:30
RICHARD Yes, that's right. I'm wondering who I'm suppose to be, who she is sometimes. 

00:21:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:21:35
RICHARD I'm very confused. 

00:21:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:21:45
[music] 

00:21:45
Reconnection with the Positives having a real conversation 

00:21:45
SANDY WILLIAMS So what is it that you're concerned about, Karen, that, that is impacting on the business? I hear that it's impacting your relationship. Or may be that's what we need to sort out. There are things to do with the business and there are things to do with the realtionship. 

00:22:05
KAREN He can't perform the way that he needs to after he's been out binging on drugs. It's as simple as that. 

00:22:15
SANDY WILLIAMS What, what do you see happening? 

00:22:20
KAREN The quality of the product goes down. 

00:22:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:22:25
KAREN He, like the staff, he can't deal with the staff. So I have to kind of deal with them. 

00:22:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:22:30
KAREN And he looks terrible. 

00:22:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:22:35
KAREN You know, I mean it's one of those that the kitchen is open so you can actually see. 

00:22:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:22:40
KAREN And he's like, he's got bags under his eyes and he's pale. 

00:22:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. Hmm. So it upsets you that the man you know and love, you know, is somehow not coming through when you see him like that. It upsets you because it's not him. It's not your Richard. Some kind of washed out number after a night of, on the hard stuff. And you want him to come across as the person, you know, what is the person that, that you, you were drawn to? That you, that you want to see when you work together and you're relaxing together. What is it that you, what do you love about this bloak? What do you want to find again with him? 

00:23:20
KAREN He used to be so caring like, and so, like he used to look after me and take care of me, and. 

00:23:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:23:30
KAREN And everything was shared in the house and everything was shared. That's the way it felt. 

00:23:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:23:30
KAREN And now, I feel like I'm carrying everything. 

00:23:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So it's quite learning for you in, in, in some ways. Mmm? 

00:23:40
KAREN Mmm. 

00:23:40
SANDY WILLIAMS And it kind of puts you into a role of more of being his manager rather than his partner. Which is not a very sexy kind of role, is it? Huh? 

00:23:50
KAREN I hate it. 

00:23:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:23:50
KAREN And he's right. We use to do it together but. 

00:23:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:23:55
KAREN It would take us a day to recover. We would go out and we would recover. 

00:24:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:24:00
KAREN But we're older now. 

00:24:00
SANDY WILLIAMS And that didn't have such an impact from, form your perspective on your business and on your, your realtionship. 

00:24:05
KAREN No because we were like, we were young, we were working for other people so, you know, we'd take a sickie. You know, who cares. 

00:24:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:24:10
KAREN But because we're younger we didn't really have to because we recovered quicker. 

00:24:15
SANDY WILLIAMS So can you tell him what it is you want back, you know. What it is you want to have again with him. Because I think probably what's happened is that you, he's heard a lot about where he's fallen short of the mark. 

00:24:30
KAREN Hmm. 

00:24:30
SANDY WILLIAMS But may be what's got lost for each of you is what drew together initially and what sustains you as a couple and what you want to kind of want to work towards having again. Hmm, so, I wonder if you can tell him again what it is that you want to have again. What you want to see, what you want to experience with him again. 

00:24:50
KAREN I just want to have a partner. I feel like you've become my child. I just want a partner again. I want to feel like you support me and that you want,00:25:05] want us to grow as a couple and have a family. And not stay in this kind of adolescent lifestyle. That's not take, it's not going anywhere. The business could be really successful. 

00:25:20
SANDY WILLIAMS So you want from him? What do you want from him again? That's, that's good, rather than getting into where he's fallen short. What is that you love about him? What is it that you want to share with him? 

00:25:35
KAREN I want his support. 

00:25:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:25:40
KAREN And I want a partnership with him. 

00:25:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So, Richard, don't you hear um, Karen talk like that. What happens in you? 

00:25:50
RICHARD Well, uh, I didn't realize that she didn't see me as a partner. We go through so much together. 

00:26:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:26:00
RICHARD And we share everything. 

00:26:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. For, for her to say that she feels quite lonely. She doesn't feel like she's your partner is, is quite a surprise for you to hear that. 

00:26:10
RICHARD I'm a little bit shocked, yeah. 

00:26:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. You, you also look a bit sad. 

00:26:15
RICHARD Mmm. 

00:26:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:26:15
RICHARD Well, I just didn't realize, that's it. We're fine together 

00:26:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. That's not how you want it to be? 

00:26:20
RICHARD No, no. 

00:26:25
SAND WILLIAMS Right. 

00:26:25
RICHARD No. I knew things were difficult but I didn't realize she felt this isolated as that. 

00:26:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Can you tell her that. 

00:26:30
RICHARD Karen I had no idea I made you feel like that. 

00:26:35
KAREN I tried to tell you but I just don't fee like you listen. 

00:26:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. 

00:26:40
RICHARD I just get afraid of the confrontation, that's all. 

00:26:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Yeah. 

00:26:50
RICHARD So, I'm trying to avoid a fight or want to get through it quickly, you know. I don't hear some of the things you say. 

00:26:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. 

00:26:55
KAREN I'll try to be a bit more clear. 

00:27:00
RICHARD No it isn't that. Um, I guess I'm a bit of fright I suppose. I sensed we are the last couple of weeks. I really hadn't returned, and I realize that now. 

00:27:15
KAREN That's why I had to bring us here. 

00:27:15
RICHARD No, it's good. 

00:27:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So, I guess this is a really good demonstration. You look quite sad, too. Huh? It's like you're having a real conversation here about what really matters. 

00:27:30
KAREN Mmm. 

00:27:30
SANDY WILLIAMS And for him to tell you he had no idea that you felt like this and that he's sad about that. He doesn't want that. That's important to you. 

00:27:40
KAREN Yeah. 

00:27:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Absolutely, yeah. So when I say, that some of the work that we, we do will help, hopeful help you have more of these conversations. That's, that's what I'll me aiming for. 

00:27:55
[music] 

00:27:55
Realistic Goal Setting clarifying drug use 

00:28:05
SANDY WILLIAMS But I'm well aware that there are some things that are going to have to change kind of behaviorally as well as the way that you talk to each other. 

00:28:10
KAREN Mmm. 

00:28:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Um, so I'm wondering what um, kind of changes they might have to be. Um, externally if you like. Um, to help this relationship. Um, do you have a notion, at the moment I hear you saying no drug use, it's got to be total. Mmm. I imagine for you that's a pretty daunting proposition. 

00:28:35
RICHARD It is, it is. But I feel that I want to give that a try because I thought I was pretty sharp. 

00:28:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:28:45
RICHARD And um, I just haven't been on the last couple of weeks. 

00:28:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:28:50
RICHARD I, I can see that from talking about that. 

00:28:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay, all right. So, this is interesting. I want to, what you're saying is for your sake you'd like to actually pull back from your drug use because you actually take pride on yourself on the work that you do, the standard of your work. And you don't like to hear that you've might of been falling short of the mark in that territory. Yeah? 

00:29:10
RICHARD Uh, yeah, yeah. Particularly in the relationship though, I'm short. 

00:29:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Oh, okay. that's, that's the other area. So then in terms of the relationship you don't like the fact that it's had this impact? 

00:29:20
RICARD No, no. I guess that's what the conflict is about. 

00:29:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:29:25
RICHARD And it makes me feel like I should do something. 

00:29:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So, what, what's the something that you think might be manageable? Because I imagine Karen, that if you saw him really making an effort, moving towards the direction that you want him too. That, that would be a good start for you. I, I understand that you want him to stop. 

00:29:45
KAREN I feel like I wouldn't mind like if he used, you know, on maybe special occasions, like you know, once, twice a year or something. You know, then it becomes something special. 

00:30:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:30:00
KAREN It's not like using all the time, I wouldn't mind that but I think, he's tried to cut down before and it doesn't work. That's why I think it's just got to stop. 

00:30:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Okay. And I think it's important to be aware that when people are trying to move out of any kind of ingrained habit any drug use is, is ingrained habit. Um, that often they, they go through many cycles of change. Mmm, they have a go at cutting down and then they pick up again. It's easy to fall into it again. So it seems like in Richard, there's an impulse towards cutting down and perhaps moving right out of it. And that's something that, that we want to support, yeah. Um, I would like to think that there's manageable way of you moving in that direction. And I think that's where, where we need to be heading together. 

00:30:55
KAREN Mm-hmm. 

00:30:55
SANDY WILLIAMS What, what do you think might be possible over the next couple of weeks, Richard? 

00:31:00
RICHARD Uh, if my friends call up, uh I should turn them down I suppose. For uh, one of our uh, sessions I guess, and I should also not initiate anything with them That might be a start. 

00:31:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. So, you're saying you won't go out with your male friends. 

00:31:20
RICHARD Yeah. 

00:31:25
SANDY WILLIAMS If they offer. 

00:31:25
RICHARD If there's any antics. 

00:31:25
SANDY WILLIAMS And by antics meaning it will probably involve using a bit? 

00:31:30
RICHARD Yeah. 

00:31:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:31:30
RICHARD Yeah. 

00:31:30
SANDY WILLIAMS I bet, are there times that you go out with your mates where, where you don't use? 

00:31:35
RICHARD Uh, no. 

00:31:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay, so that's, it's pretty much focused, that's a kind of shared activity. 

00:31:40
RICHARD Mmm. 

00:31:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:31:40
RICHARD Yes. 

00:31:40
SANDY WILLIAMS It's a bit of a shame really, isn't it because I guess the connection with them is, is good fun and nice. And may be that something that we'll try to explore whether there are ways to try to keep a connection with them under other, under different conditions. Hmm? 

00:31:55
RICHARD Yeah, it does draw attention to that. I suppose that's what it's founded on. 

00:32:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, yeah. 

00:32:00
RICHARD It certainly be up to something if we did go out. 

00:32:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. So, you're recgonizing that, that's risky territory and that you might me prepared to forgo that over the next few weeks just to see what that does in the mix of things with your relationship. 

00:32:15
RICHARD Mmm. 

00:32:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Um, would that, would that be a good start for you or would, would something else need to happen for you to feel like you could kind of pull back a bit from attack mode we've talked about, yeah? 

00:32:25
KAREN I think if he does go out with his friends he won't use. 

00:32:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:32:30
KAREN So, if he's just prepared to do that I don't think, that's fine. I don't think he'll use. 

00:32:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. And what is it that, that you're willing to do. That you think, you know, because I guess, this, this is something were you feel you both kind of putting effort into making changes. Are there things that you could do less of more of that would help? Maybe Richard, you, you, you could suggest, is there anything that you think um, would be helpful if Karen did less of or more of? 

00:33:10
RICHARD Um, well the conflicts always about this topic or, or theme, I guess. 

00:33:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:33:15
RICHARD I don't know if we'd have any? 

00:33:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:33:20
RICHARD Any argument, uh. 

00:33:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:33:20
RICHARD Just not for that. 

00:33:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. 

00:33:25
RICHARD I'd have more perspective if I wasn't. 

00:33:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:33:30
RICHARD So, shabby, you know. 

00:33:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Right. Okay. 

00:33:30
KAREN That's the way I see it as well. 

00:33:35
SANDY WILIAMS Right. 

00:33:35
KAREN I don't think um, I'll, if he's not using I won't be nagging him. 

00:33:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, and that's what gets a fire in your belly. 

00:33:45
KAREN Yeah. And that's what the thing that he gets upset about is me nagging him. 

00:33:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. 

00:33:50
KAREN Yeah. 

00:33:50
RICHARD Yeah, I was going to say less nagging. I don't know if that will be a constructive comment, but uh, I don't know. 

00:33:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Well, you know, I, uh, it'll, it'll be interesting to see what happens in terms of how you're relating to one another if, if you're able to make this, this kind of agreement that, that you've come to. Hmm, it might be possible and it might not. And I think we need to be open to review what happens when we get together again. But I think it's lovely that you can both agree that probably if, if your drug use can move in the direction of fading out of the picture that the relationship is really very strong and robust underneath. 

00:34:30
KAREN Hmm. 

00:34:30
SANDY WILLIAMS There's a lot of shared um, affection, enjoyment of one another, um, shared values and ideals, shared goals, you know. And that maybe will have room to breathe again if this one element of it, that's been a sticking point for both of you shifts. Yeah? 

00:34:45
RICHARD Yeah. 

00:34:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So, we'll um, talk again down the track. Um, I'll see each of you individually um, in between. Um, and then we'll get together again probably that will make it about three weeks, and we'll see how you've been traveling in that time. Does that feel like how to stop there? 

00:35:05
KAREN Yep. 

00:35:05
RICHARD Yeah. 

00:35:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay, good. 

00:35:10
[music] 

00:35:10
SESSION TWO 

00:35:10
Dealing with a Lapse 

00:35:10
SANDY WILLIAMS So, it's been three, just over three weeks since we last met and I'll be interested to see how you've been traveling. But my guess is there've been some hitches because you don't look too happy. No. Who, who would like to start and tell me how you've been traveling in the last three weeks.? 

00:35:50
RICHARD You start, you were quite vocal on our way here. 

00:35:55
[sil.] 

00:36:00
KAREN He has kept using at the same rate as he was using before. 

00:36:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:36:05
KAREN And I feel like this is a waste of time and money because if he's not going to do what he says he's going to do. 

00:36:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:36:10
KAREN Then what's the point. 

00:36:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So, so for you the, the commitment to this process has to be translated to behavioral change if we put it at that level, hmm? Unless he's doing some things differently this process of working on it together, is that what you're saying is, is a waste of money. 

00:36:30
KAREN Well, I just feel like he's not doing it. That he's not committed to it. 

00:36:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:36:35
KAREN Like he said that, you know, I was like, you know, if you do this again I'll leave you and then, you know, he did. And then he did it again. And I said if you don't come and get therapy, if you don't get help then I'll leave you. So he comes and gets therapy but he doesn't, he doesn't do the work. 

00:36:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:36:50
KAREN So, I'm like, what, what can I do now. Like what can I do. I've tried everything. 

00:36:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:36:55
KAREN It's been going on for a year like this. 

00:37:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:37:00
 I'm getting really tired. 

00:37:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So, you feel, are you pissed off with him? And you feel a bit despairing too? 

00:37:10
KAREN Yeah. 

00:37:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm, Okay. Tell me what's happened from your perspective, Richard. 

00:37:15
RICHARD Well, we have an agreement which um, I'm committed to but it just will take a bit longer. It's also between me and my, my friends. It was a special occasion that had come up. 

00:37:25
SANDY WILLIAMS But you said that you weren't going to go out with your friends. I thought that's what we agreed. Like why did you? Why didn't you just say no, that's what you said you were going to do? You didn't have to go, like it wasn't a special occasion, like it was a birthday of someone who's not even your closest friend. 

00:37:40
RICHARD You should of come too. 

00:37:40
KAREN I didn't want to come. I didn't want to get stuck with you while you're using drugs. I didn't, I don't like that anymore. And any way, even had I been there it wouldn't of stopped you from using. You would of used anyway. 

00:37:50
RICHARD Yeah, well what happened to you too? What happened to your spontanaity? The fire you used to have. 

00:37:55
KAREN I told you, I'm not doing that anymore. That's why we're here. This is what I mean, he doesn't seem to understand why we're here and what we're doing. 

00:38:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:38:05
KAREN I mean how many times, like you were here last time. We agreed that you wouldn't go out with your friends, that you wouldn't use. And now he's still saying, I want you to use. Like, are you not listening to this? 

00:38:15
RICHARD Yeah, I, it's just going to take a bit longer. I mean I will turn them down eventually. But it wasn't. 

00:38:20
KAREN If I could believe that, I don't believe that. I don't believe that you're, that you're going to try. Like if I believed that it would take a bit longer and that it was actually going to happen then I'd be prepared to wait. But I don't feel like you're showing me anything that you're committed to this, apart from saying yes, yes, yes. 

00:38:35
RICHARD Of course, you know, Karen, I can't just, it won't work out that way. 

00:38:40
KAREN You can just say no. 

00:38:40
RICHARD Mmm. 

00:38:40
KAREN You know, how to say no. 

00:38:45
RICHARD Yeah, I do. I just didn't that's all. 

00:38:50
KAREN Why? 

00:38:55
[sil.] 

00:38:55
RICHARD It seemed like a fun thing to do at the time but. 

00:38:55
SANDY WILLIAMS So is this how it happens? Is this the pattern? 

00:39:05
KAREN Pretty much. 

00:39:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. And when you say nothings changed and, and there's been no, no shift at all? 

00:39:15
KAREN Not that I've seen. 

00:39:20
RICHARD I feel like it's been half. 

00:39:20
SANDY WILLIAMS You do, what, what do you think, what's happened under your skin. 

00:39:25
RICHARD I see it as just, just a run-off really. 

00:39:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:39:25
RICHARD I'm still getting used to it. 

00:39:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:39:30
RICHARD The idea of not using anymore. 

00:39:35
SANDY WILLIAMS So was it just the one ocassion. I'm, I'm not, I'm not quite clear? 

00:39:35
KAREN It was the week before as well. 

00:39:40
RICHARD That wasn't a run, now. 

00:39:40
KAREN Yeah, but you're still using, that's the point. It's still using. 

00:39:45
RICHARD I was fine by Monday. I was, you know, I was pretty good. 

00:39:50
KAREN Big deal, you know, like he didn't stay out all night. 

00:39:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Oh. 

00:39:55
KAREN Big deal. Like he stayed out till 3:00 or something. 

00:39:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So there've been two, two occasions where you kind of got caught in the process a bit. Yeah? 

00:40:00
RICHARD Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah. 

00:40:05
SANDY WILLIAMS And for you that, that means he hasn't committed himself to, to doing what you thought he'd agreed to. Hmm? And you said, that you've seen him stop in the past. What, under what conditions was that Richard? Do you know when, when did you stop and how long? Do you remember? 

00:40:25
RICHARD Uh. 

00:40:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Last time? 

00:40:30
RICHARD Yes, she sort of threatened me and I considered it. Okay. 

00:40:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Threatened you? 

00:40:35
RICHARD Ah, she was going to leave me if I didn't stop. And it wasn't good for the business. I thought well, if you say so. 

00:40:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, so. 

00:40:40
RICHARD That's, that's okay for awhile. 

00:40:45
SANDY WILIAMS Right, so, when the stakes are pretty high. 

00:40:45
RICHARD Mmm, mmm. 

00:40:45
SANDY WILLIAMS It's like you kind of rally and, and. 

00:40:45
RICHARD Yeah 

00:40:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Find it in yourself to. 

00:40:50
RICHARD And I can do it again, it's just you know, really was going sign off on it. 

00:40:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:40:55
RICHARD I just wanted to have, you know, another, another big run or so. 

00:40:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. 

00:41:00
RICHARD I'll, I'll tell my friends about it and they'll, they'll be all right. 

00:41:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So have? 

00:41:00
RICHARD I haven't told them yet. 

00:41:00
SANDY WILLIAMS You haven't told them yet? 

00:41:05
RICHARD Oh, I mean, I did mention it but. 

00:41:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:41:05
RICHARD I didn't think they took me seriously at the time. But I will, I will mention it to them. 

00:41:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. You don't. 

00:41:15
KAREN They won't care, they just want him to go out. And they're not gonna go ah, we'll, we'll help you. 

00:41:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:41:15
KAREN We won't call you. 

00:41:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:41:15
KAREN They'll go don't be stupid. I know what they're like. 

00:41:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:41:20
KAREN They try to get me to use all the time still. 

00:41:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:41:25
KAREN They're not gonna, it's gonna help by telling them. They'll just laugh or you know. 

00:41:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:41:30
KAREN I don't know what they'll do but. 

00:41:30
SANDY WILLIAMS What I sense in you is really, it's almost kind of like, like a bit of a panic. You know, like is he going to do this or not? And if he doesn't what is our life going to be like together and what about our plans for the future. What about having baby and, and this has to to happen otherwise I can't see forward. Is that how? 

00:41:50
KAREN I feel like we're not moving forward and we're also going to be spiraling downwards. 

00:41:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:41:50
KAREN That's how I feel like we're spirling downwards. 

00:41:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:41:55
KAREN I want to move forwards. 

00:42:00
SANDY WILLIAMS So how, how much do you think you can tolerate, if Richard's deankum(ph), in terms of moving out of his drug use but can't quite do it at the pace that you would like him to be able to do it? Uh, you, how, how much tolerance is there in the picture do you think? 

00:42:20
KAREN Without him making changes. 

00:42:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:42:25
KAREN How do I know that he's deankum(ph). 

00:42:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:42:25
KAREN How do I know he's not just saying. 

00:42:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:42:30
RICHARD It gets really hard, the guys don't, cuz she stopped using she won't socialize with us anymore. It's like a wedge between us. 

00:42:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:42:35
RICHARD It's like they're trying to make me choose, you know, really forget about her. And I don't want to do that at all, but I want to maintain my friendships, you know. 

00:42:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Yes. 

00:42:45
RICHARD And, and they really don't give any latitude for that. And I'm trying, you know, to please everyone and it's. 

00:42:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:42:50
RICHARD It's, it's turning me inside out. 

00:42:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, so you will, you feel torn between Karen, who you love. 

00:42:55
RICHARD Yeah. 

00:42:55
SANDY WILLIAMS And she's your partner, she's your wife. She's, you're in business together, you have a future together. You've got those mates who are pretty important to you as well. 

00:43:05
RICHARD Yeah. 

00:43:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Remember last time we met you, we, we didn't spend much time on it but there was the prospect that maybe you could start to see some of those guys in a different setting. And if you haven't talked to any of them yet, you know, maybe that's, that would be helpful. 

00:43:20
RICHARD Yeah, you know, what are we going to do, see a movie. I mean, I don't know what. 

00:43:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:43:25
RICHARD How to re-, reconfigure this situation. 

00:43:25
SANDY WILLIAMS You can't, yeah. It's like you've lost kind of, you haven't had pract-, practice in socializing in other ways. 

00:43:30
RICHARD No. 

00:43:35
SANDY WILLIAMS For awhile. 

00:43:35
KAREN I don't understand why they, why he can't just go out and have a drink. I mean that's what I do. 

00:43:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:43:40
KAREN I just go out and have a couple of drinks. 

00:43:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:43:40
KAREN And I don't understand why he always has to go, you know, we have to go smoke off to the toilet and start doing lines. I don't, I don't understand in what's missing in going out and having a drink. And having, you know, that having a dance, having a chat. 

00:43:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, yeah. Do you, do you drink alcohol, Richard? Do, do you or is it, what? 

00:44:00
RICHARD I try to start the night that way but it's just if, you know, when all the disappearing to the toilet and all of the lines going on. 

00:44:10
KAREN You just can't say no. 

00:44:10
RICHARD It's just if we, I'm, uh. I feel like I need to cut out of there before someone drags me into the cubicle. But if that starts at about 11:00, half past 11:00. 

00:44:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Oh. 

00:44:20
RICHARD But if we go home that early it's not like we really had a night. 

00:44:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Huh. 

00:44:20
RICHARD I just can't really accept. 

00:44:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:44:20
RICHARD Not going out like that anymore. 

00:44:25
[music] 

00:44:25
Exploring Motivation for Use shifts in perception 

00:44:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Well, I'm wondering, you know, what the specific effect of using a bit of coke is? And you know, I mean alcohol is, is in a category of a downer. If you like it, it kind of chills you out and smoothes you down, and makes you pretty cruzy. Mmm? 

00:44:45
RICHARD Hmm. 

00:44:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Um, using coke is much more of uh, um, a kind of a boost of energy. It's also something that gives you a sense of a bit confident, a bit invincible, and kind of nothings to hard. And if there's problems you can deal with them later, down the track, you know. So, drugs have a paticular kind of function. And I'm wondering if, if there's something in that, that we should consider? You know, so that the prospect of being without that is a bit daunting for you. Yeah. It's not the drugs so much as what the experience is. 

00:45:15
RICHARD Mmm, ah, yeah. But I mean I only use it for socializing. So things connected to itself in a way, I'm confident I have a lot of fun in the small hours of the morning. 

00:45:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:45:25
RICHARD But, you know, what Karen's saying is do I really, do I really need to be out. And, and I don't. I'm starting to find the guys a bit. 

00:45:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:45:35
RICHARD Immature, but they are, they are my friends, you know. 

00:45:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:45:40
RICHARD And if I deal with them then they've got me doing all. 

00:45:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:45:40
RICHARD Stuff, yeah. 

00:45:45
SANDY WILLIAMS What's going on for you, you're shaking? 

00:45:45
KAREN I always felt like when we both used to use. 

00:45:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:45:50
KAREN Like when we both used coke. 

00:45:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:45:50
KAREN Mostly when we were in London because it was easy to get there. I always felt like I could take it or leave it but for him, he, he got something out of it. 

00:46:00
RICHARD No, I was fine. 

00:46:00
KAREN That I didn't like, something more about, yeah, like, his confidence and his, he kind of changes in a way that I don't. Like when I have it. 

00:46:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:46:10
KAREN Like it just makes me more. 

00:46:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. 

00:46:15
KAREN More the way I am, where as for him, he's quite introverted actually, generally. 

00:46:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:46:20
KAREN But once he has coke, he's really extroverted. 

00:46:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:46:20
KAREN He's like the life of the party. 

00:46:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:46:25
KAREN He has all these great ideas. 

00:46:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:46:25
KAREN And I, I think that, I think that there's something to that. 

00:46:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. That was really interesting. I would imagine because I guess if you could think about it more in that way. What's, what's the purpose of Richard using this drug. It's not to take him away from you, it's not to indicate to you that you don't count. 

00:46:50
KAREN Mm-hmm. 

00:46:50
SANDY WILLIAMS If there's something about him as a individual which is driving him to have that experience because without it he doesn't, he feels a bit at sea. He doesn't know how to quite manage himself in those situations. It might help, last time we met we talked about it being important that you don't take this personally. Although it has a huge personal impact on you. That it might help with that sense of being really split from him. Do you see what I'm getting at? 

00:47:15
KAREN I guess but, I, Like I just, I I, I think, I think I do understand that he kind of, yeah, that he gets something out of it that I don't understand. 

00:47:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. 

00:47:25
KAREN But I don't really respect that in a way. 

00:47:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, right. 

00:47:30
KAREN Like I was always brought up to, you know, do the right thing. 

00:47:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:47:35
KAREN And be sort of like, use you full potential. 

00:47:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:47:40
KAREN Work hard[0047:45] and. 

00:47:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:47:40
KAREN I mean drugs was something that I did because I was young. And I think everyone does it when you're young. 

00:47:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:47:50
KAREN But actually deep down I don't really understand it, I don't really like it. 

00:47:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. So there's part of you recoils from, from the way that Richard's using. 

00:48:00
KAREN Mmm. 

00:48:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. 

00:48:00
KAREN Yeah. 

00:48:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. But it may help from, you know, this notion of kind of tolerance as he's moving, moving out of it. It may help to be focusing on the fact he, he does have different history, a different pattern of use, a different reason for using than you. Hanging on to the fact, I think we finished up the last session saying, that in fact this really the only major sticking point between you. This is a very solid relationship, very strong connection here. A lot of love and a lot of dreams about the future, that you know, you're in line with one another. Um, so, you know, I guess, I hear you saying Richard, that you do want to move out of this. Hmm? That you do want to have children together, we want to uh, business to be a success. And I'm hearing you say also that you're starting to feel a bit like doing the stuff with the guys that you do is, is, it doesn't have quite same enjoyment as it did. It's feeling a bit kind of, a bit hollow in some ways. Is that right? 

00:49:05
RICHARD Yeah. 

00:49:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. 

00:49:05
RICHARD Yeah, it is. Just um, can't help thinking about the way things are at home and um, the damage I'm doing to my body and everything. 

00:49:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay, okay. 

00:49:15
RICAHRD And um, part of the reason for success in the first place was to just forget about all those problems, whatever they might be. 

00:49:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:49:20
RICHARD Could be like, could be anything I care about. 

00:49:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:49:25
RICHARD I don't care about anymore about just care about being an idiot, it was great fun. 

00:49:30
[music] 

00:49:30
Joining around the Problem and the Solution 

00:49:30
RICHARD You know I actually can't get, take myself out of head about that anymore. I mean I'm in an altered state, but you know. 

00:49:45
SANDY WILLIAMS It doesn't quite feel the same. 

00:49:45
RICHARD I'm aware I got a problem at the same time or yeah. 

00:49:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Is this news to you? 

00:49:50
KAREN Yeah. And I, like there's part of me that's just going, I don't believe this because it's so not in line with his behavior. 

00:49:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:49:55
KAREN I'm like I don't believe what I'm hearing in a way. 

00:50:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:50:00
RICHARD Well, I actually thought that was partly the person you fell in love with because we used to have a lot of fun in London doing all of that. And that guy with the big crazy ideas and all of that, and the party animal. I know you say it revolts you and everything but I thought if I put that guy in the cupboard how would you feel about me after that, you know. 

00:50:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Wow. 

00:50:15
RICHARD This uh, this uh, letting go a big part of myself. I thought, is it really me. I, I don't know. 

00:50:25
KAREN That's not who I feel in love with. 

00:50:30
SANDY WILLIAMS That's pretty interesting. Isn't it? Maybe, you know, if this man's been wondering if he kind of let go that part of him that's out there, that's, that's confident, creative, crazy man, good ideas, full of ends that you find the straight man a bit pale. 

00:50:50
KAREN That's not who I feel in love with. I feel in love with your gentleness and your kindness. Not the, not that person that you become then. I mean that was fun back then but that's not, that's not what it is between us. 

00:51:15
RICHARD Oh, I didn't know that. I, I just, it seemed to be such a big part of our life 'cuz you know. 

00:51:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:51:20
RICHARD It's so, it fills our discussions or arguments, and why we're here that I, I just couldn't let go of it or separate it out as irrelevant, you know, the whole dilemma of hanging on to it. 

00:51:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. 

00:51:45
[sil.] 

00:51:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Well this is a bit of a surprise, huh. 

00:51:50
KAREN I didn't know that. 

00:51:55
[sil.] 

00:51:55
RICHARD Uh, I didn't really know it either until we, until we talked about it I guess. I didn't know how to say it, you know. I feel like you do. 

00:52:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Hmm. Well, the fact that you said it actually produced a pretty big impact, Richard. Hmm? 

00:52:25
RICHARD Yeah. It's just, yeah. I think I should get well. Get off the stuff 

00:52:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. That's an interesting choice of words isn't it. Get well, it's kind of like you want to do well together and you've talked about the fact of the sense of, it is damaging you in some way, yeah. Some sense that you can't keep kind of operating in over-drive. That it is going to have some wear and tear on you, hmm. Maybe this is about, you know, part of it is be you kind of being more confident that this man does want to be with you. You know, he does care about the same things. He has in fact been quite confused about you know, what kind of changes he needs to make and would be okay with you. It's kind of, it's all got focused on the drug use rather than, you know, who you are as people. 

00:53:15
KAREN For some reason it just makes me so angry. 

00:53:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Yes, yeah. 

00:53:20
KAREN And I forget all this. 

00:53:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:53:20
KAREN All of this stuff. 

00:53:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:53:25
KAREN Between us. 

00:53:25
SANDY WILLIAMS And you know, you're, you're a very competent woman who is very confident. And when we talked about your upbringing and the things that you've accomplished, you know, you've been able to set you mind, you know, set your sails and achieve what you want, whatever you've chosen to do, you know. And that's because you're intelligent and resourceful, and hard working and you've had some pretty good conditions. Hmm? Um, some help along the way from some pretty solid parents. They had their issues, hmm. Richard's had of a bit more kind of a wobbly past, you know. He had loving parents but there were some fractures and, and maybe you know, he, he hasn't had the benefit of, of developing perhaps the confidence in himself that you have. But I hear a lot of connection and a lot of pointing in the same direction between the two of you. Hmm. I think that, that it's probably going to require, there's probably going to be a few bumps along the way. But I'm wondering whether you are feeling more able to believe that Richard wants to move in the direction that you do, then when we first started to talk 3 weeks or so ago. Yeah? 

00:54:30
KAREN I think so. 

00:54:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:54:35
KAREN Yep. 

00:54:35
SANDY WILLIAMS So, I don't think this is going to be miraculous. And you know when, when Richard, when you made declaration last time I was tempted to go down the track and saying I wonder if you're biting off more than you can chew here. 

00:54:45
RICHARD Ah. 

00:54:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:54:50
RICHARD Yeah, well, Karen is most important to me and the business, and having a family and all of that is. 

00:54:55
UNKONWN Hmm. 

00:54:55
RICHARD What drives me. 

00:54:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. 

00:54:55
RICHARD But just the drugs and the scene is so, is so big. It looks like, even to myself even, that I lavishing more attention and affection on to that. 

00:55:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:55:05
RICHARD It's confusing to me, it's confusing to everybody. 

00:55:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. And my sense was last time you got kind of caught up in the, in the, yes I'll do this because, you know, we're talking well here and we're pointed in the same direction. And I'll, I will do it, but maybe it was a bit hasty, and may be there needed to be a bit more exploring about what it all means and how you get caught in that, you know. And maybe, you know, today we've made a bit more progress down that track. And I, I think, you know, between now and the next time we meet it will be interesting to see what happens. I wonder if it might be better to just let um, Richard kind of grapple with those issues now that you have a bit more of a shared understanding. Rather than of setting a specific target that now says, you know, I will swear, you know, scout's honor, that I won't use over the next 2 weeks. Hmm. That maybe you let some of these natural forces and see, see where that takes you. Do you have, what do you think, Richard? 

00:56:05
RICHARD Yeah. Because, I mean to sort of say, I'm not doing that anymore, I, I got a sense of I was doing it for her. 

00:56:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:56:10
RICHARD When we discussed that before but. 

00:56:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:56:10
RICHARD Actually, you know, pulling it apart and looking at it for myself. 

00:56:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:56:15
RICHARD I'm not that compelled to entertain it anymore. 

00:56:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. 

00:56:20
RICHARD Not really. 

00:56:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, so it's about the relationship but it's also about you, what, what the stuff is doing to you. 

00:56:25
RICHARD Yeah, what was defining me. In a way that's what it does. 

00:56:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:56:30
RICHARD I'm afraid to let it go. 

00:56:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:56:30
KAREN I think I need to let it go a bit. 

00:56:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:56:35
KAREN I think I need to kind of let him because I don't think that the way I deal with this is helping. 

00:56:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. 

00:56:40
KAREN At all. 

00:56:40
SANDY WILLIAMS It might be that, that you know, when, when we meet next time maybe if you and I meet[00:56:50 that we can do a little bit of work on how you can kind of contain that panic and anxiety that you get. That's never going to happen and stay connected to, to his commitment to you and, and the life ahead, you know. That may be kind of managing some of that anxiety and panic yourself would be helpful. 

00:57:05
KAREN I agree. 

00:57:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. Yeah. Okay, well, I feel, you know, moved at, at the kind of depths you got onto today to get a shared, more of a shared kind of perspective on this, this issue. Um, and I'll look forward to meeting you next time. Okay.
