JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN My Name is John Sommers-Flanagan. I'm a professor of Counselor Education at the University of Montana. And I'm also the author of several text books, uh… including Clinical Interviewing, and Counseling and Psychotherapy Skills and Strategies. And so it's my honor and privilege to be here for the Great Teachers Great Courses project. And welcome. I'm really glad to have you guys here and we're gonna talk about one of my favorite topics, it's so exciting, it's Clinical Interviewing, that is pretty exciting. So, we're gonna talk about the goals and the process and the procedures of the clinical interview, but not just any clinical interview, but the initial clinical interview. So the first one, and now, if you're a new student, it may not just be the initial interview we're talking about, it might be your first initial interview or your initial-initial interview. So, I want to be open to the possibility that maybe you haven't seen anybody before in counseling and you haven't had a first session. Now, the Intake Interview or the Initial Interview, same process, two different names and again other disciplines might even call it something else. But it has been, and it remains the starting point for all kinds of counseling. Now, I remember my first initial interview ever, it was terrible. And I want, in part, to do this lecture to help it, so your first one or your next one is not terrible. But I remember, somehow I talked my supervisors into letting me co, be a co-therapist with an advanced student for a couples counseling session. We're 10 minute in the session, 10 minutes in the session and we're being video recorded. And, uh… the woman declares that, uh… her husband has been physically abusive, she jumps up and she runs out of the room. And my co-therapist jumps up and he runs out of the room after him. This is my first time ever doing real live counseling. And I'm there with the guy who is allegedly, umm… uh… abusive. And so I just start talking, I don't even know what I was saying. And I remember, the supervisor, of course, in front of the whole class as we're watching the video, stopping the tape and saying, John, sometimes you just don't start talking, sometimes it might be better to just say, let's take a breath and just get centered before we decide what we should talk about next. Uh… But my anxiety was like a train moving forward, and sometimes, when anxious, I will talk. I would like to affirm with you that we need to prepare and we need to prepare for many reasons, it might be that the first session you have, is somebody who is grieving and says, I lost my husband six months ago and I can't stop crying. And the person might start crying immediately with you. And/or the person might look at you and say, I don't believe in counseling, and I think this is stupid. I'm only here 'cause I have to be here. and so there are many ways people can present and we need to try to deal with each person individually and differently. So, a 17-year-old gymnast is gonna be different than a 15-year-old or 50-year old, uh… rancher from Montana. So our goal today is to describe the three main objectives of the intake interview. But also to clarify the process and the procedures we need to use to get there. So, we get these three objectives, I'm gonna tell them to you momentarily. But, we also have some processes and procedures that we use to get there. And another subtitle for this particular lecture is first things first. This is about structure, it's about format, it's about the flow of the clinical interview, the intake interview. Now the usual main goal of an intake is, almost traditionally, always assessment. We want to gather information from the individual, so that we can make a case formulation. So we know where to go. And as discussed in lecture one, we're also doing other things, we're developing the relationship and we're may be even doing an intervention or some therapeutic helping in the moment, in the interview. But, let's take a look at what is assessment, anyway, and how is it happening in the initial interview. Now it's information gathering or data collection or observation. Now, you know, now everybody says we should all be data driven. I mean, the clinical interview, the intake interview is really about collecting data. And so, it's collecting data, will then drive our formulation of the treatment plan. But, the way it works is that we do observations and then we come up with hypotheses about those observations. And we organize those hypotheses into a case formulation and then we organize the case formulation into a treatment plan. Okay, so you can see, I've got an easy button here, 'cause that's not easy. And you're gonna try do all that in a 50 minute hour, boom, and be ready to make a statement about how you can be of help to the person or the right referral or whatever your endpoint is in the initial interview. So, the three big objectives and umm… these, this is my take on the three big objectives, this is what I've written about, umm… in the clinical interviewing text book. I feel like, at the end of that first interview, we need to know about the problem, the person, and the current level of functioning or the current situation that the person is exposed to. So, we have these three things we focus on. What are the problems, what's the person like, okay. And how is the person currently functioning in the unique environments that that person is in. So for example, you might see somebody who has a number of depressive symptoms, maybe a bunch of self-deprecatory thoughts, a person thinks, I'm terrible, I, you know, I just don't measure up. And so you have a bunch of depressive symptoms, may be some insomnia, may be low self-esteem, maybe there is some suicidal thoughts, maybe there is depressed mood. And so you start to think, oh, there is some depressive symptoms that is related to the problem. And then we look at the person and maybe in the room, you notice you got this hyper-responsible, hyper-self-critical individual in the room with you. And that she or he just can hardly even get a few sentences out, without then also judging himself or herself, okay. And so you start to see that personality in the room with you. And then, you might then notice, that both of those things, the symptoms as well as the personality style, maybe a little perfectionist, take if you want to call to that, interferes with the current functioning. And in particular, it's activated by the situations that this individual is in, and that's sort of, our goal, is to collect information about all three of those main targets or objectives. But how we go about it, depends a lot on us, right. It depends on your personality and preference. It depends on your theoretical orientation. It depends on, you know, the setting that you work in. And it also depends on the client and maybe the client's preferences, goals, abilities and more. And like I said, that 17-year-old gymnast and the 50-year-old Montana rancher, you might have to approach gathering information about the problem, the person and the current situation or functioning in a little bit of a different way depending on the individual client. So, how do we get there? How do we go from point A, get first things first and get last things last? And so there is a process and a procedure, Shawn Shae, a psychiatrist, actually has identified a five stage model for the generic clinical interview. And we're gonna go through those five stages and talk a little bit about what happens in each of those five stages. First stage is the introduction, second is opening, third is body, fourth is closing, fifth is termination. Now of course, imagine getting that out of order, right. You know, you don't start with termination and you don't start with, you know, by saying, well, I could see our time is almost up, today. Obviously, we have a sequence and we're gonna go through the sequence and each stage includes a range of different things that could happen. Now, we don't want to do this in a lock step way. We don't want to say I'm in stage one, I can't. But for Shae and other people, stage one, you know, is the initial contact. And of course, the initial contact is an experience of its own. It's different than, that when you sit down in the room and you do the introduction, I mean, not the introduction, but you do the opening, the introduction is all this initial stuff that's gonna happen. Now first contact, may be, you're on the phone, may be, you have some kind of a website and you have an internet, interface somehow and you're communicating with the person that way. May be its face-to-face, but you guys know the power of first impressions, right. May be you think about, you know, if I had walked out here and my tie was super crooked, or I wasn't wearing a tie, or I was just wearing shorts, and a Hawaiian shirt. I mean, that's just how clothing can affect first impressions, right. And we know first impressions are powerful in the way that we then continue to think about someone. So, we want to be conscious in the way we present ourselves. And so for this telephone contact, I don't want to say, well, hi there, umm… and you're trying to get maybe a 4'o clock appointment, the person says, "Can you see me 4'o clock on Tuesday?" I say, "Oh, shoot, you know, actually my partner is having a colonoscopy, so I can't." Oh, no, you don't say that, right. That's too much information, you tend to want to be very professional in your interactions, we don't need to give, I mean, we want to be genuine and transparent, all those good things, but we also want to have some professional boundaries. Initial face-to-face meeting and the conversation that starts, that's tough. I'm a terrible chit chatter, small talker. I'm just not very good at it, I get kind of uncomfortable. But you need to… you need to watch people who are really good at it and then, sort of, emulate a few of those things. And of course, there are certain topics that are off limits, you know, just to say, well, you know, I noticed that, umm… the city council is not gonna fund, you know, it's like, but you got to stay out of politics. You know, typically the chit chats about, you know, did you make it? Did you find your way to the office? Umm… Was it easy? Did the parking go okay? Just want to make sure. Umm… And if the person, you know, initiates something, it's… you might start your active listening right there in the waiting room, right. And… And then move with the person back into the room. This is all about rapport building. We know, uh… people from other cultures, often times, uh… in the Latino culture, charlar or small talk is a very important part of the rapport building process. We want to think about, well, how are we gonna integrate that in. I know, working with native American populations in Montana, that often times, one of the best ways that we can make an initial connection is by sharing back and forth people who you know. Obviously, I'm not gonna share clients who I know, but fortunately I have students who are native American, and I can say, oh, this… this one person named Celina, was in my, uh… program and she is a Crow Indian. And so, umm… I just thought she was fabulous. And so now there is some danger there, the person may hate Celina, but it gives you a sense of connection. And, uh… in the Native American tradition, that's a good way to start the connection. So, putting the client at ease, Carl Jung used to have this thing that he would say I… I see you're in the soup now too. And his message was supposed to be something like, well, this happens to all of us, it's universal, we're all in the soup and now you're in it too and we can help get you out of it. Uh… I would prefer a phrase something like I'm really glad that you came, uh… and I… I'll look forward to getting to know you more and to working with you. And I might even say something that instills hope in the beginning. I might even say, I think that counseling can help, uh… and so I might say that, umm… upfront. So we also do psycho-education and role induction in this introduction stage. Uh… And the psycho-education and role induction is, umm… should be collaborative. I mean, we want to try to do that collaboratively, but also, it involves that standard stuff, what you're saying here, stays here, it's private, personal information. Obviously, umm… I want to treat your private personal information with respect and privacy, the privacy it deserves. Now I need to also tell you there are limits to the privacy. If you're a danger to yourself, a danger to someone else or you tell me some things about child or elder abuse, well, there's a court order for me to release information, those are all situations in which I… I have to release information. But, I want to you to know that I… it's not that I think that's the case with you, but I just need to share that with everybody upfront. I try to say that in a way 'cause some people when you say that, they'll say, but I'm not a child abuser, or they'll feel, kind of, defensive inside, try to follow that with. It's not that I think that's the case, it's just a standard information, you probably saw it in the form and I need to repeat it to you now. Sometimes, umm… as we move to the opening, I will do some psycho-education or role induction in the opening. For example, if I'm working with a parent, I… I might be doing a single session intervention. I'm just doing one session, boom! And I'll say, so the way I like to work is I mostly will listen for the first half of our meeting. And then about half way through, I'll be more active. I might start to suggest some ideas for things that could help you with whatever issues you're facing at home. And I then will say to the client in an invitation for collaboration something like, but I sure hope you'll tell me, if you want me to shut up and listen more. And I hope you'll tell me, if you would like me to offer you more ideas or guidance about something that you might want to try in your family. So, it's a way of offering or inviting collaboration. Now the opening statement that you say is traditionally pretty non-directive, but that's going to vary a lot of on your theoretical orientation, right. You know, if you're a reality therapist, you're going to start a little differently and the focus will be on, well, what do, what do you want? And it will be a big what do you want. What do you want in life? And maybe, what do you want in this session? And you probably go back and forth, and focus on that first. And, but traditionally the less directive, uh… opening is what brings you here. Now on occasion, I've had people say, well, the bus brought me, you know, and that reveals something to you about the person. But really what psychological or emotional or interpersonal thing has brought you here is what the question is about. If I'm a CBT person, I'm probably gonna use some role induction and an invitation for collaboration and say something like, I would like to start by making a problem list and by having you share with me some things that are troubling to you. And then we can start to sort them out as our session goes on. And see what of these that we would like to focus on and work on together in counseling. And the problem list is gonna be the big focus for the CBT person. If I'm doing Person-centered Therapy, Carl Rogers would have this fabulous opening where he would say whatever you would like to talk about, about yourself, about how you feel about yourself, whatever you would like to say in here, I would be very glad to hear, okay, much different than a problem list. So, your theoretical orientation is gonna really drive your opening. Solution focused, they're probably gonna do the formula first session question, we're gonna to get to that later. So, the client's opening response to your opening, often times, will end up being something that we kind of distill into the chief complaint. And the chief complaint is the… is the client's perception of the problem. Why she or he has chosen to come to counseling now? We call that the chief complaint, it comes from psychiatry. We also are gonna be evaluating the client's verbal behavior, cognitions, emotions, exceptions depending on our theoretical orientation. If I'm a CBT person, I'm looking at cognitions, you know. If I am reality therapy, I'm gonna to be thinking about how… you know, is whatever the person is doing to try to get what she or he wants, is it working? What are the flaws? Maybe we need to develop or design a new plan. So, we'll be doing this kind of assessment in the session based on theoretical orientation. Or if you're solution focused person, you're intervening immediately. There's just, they don't even, they do not believe much in assessment. The Body Stage is the middle, think about this as a trip, where you start on the surface and then you get deeper and deeper and then you're gonna come back up to the surface in the end. We don't want to end in the middle, I don't want to have my clients in the midst of talking about conflicts with her biological mother, umm… and then say, well, I guess our time is up, right. We want to come back up to the present in the surface. So depending on your theoretical orientation, umm… this is the time if I'm… if I'm really supposed to do a diagnostic interview, I'm doing a diagnostic interview, I'm ca… I'm doing symptom based questioning. If I'm an Adlerian, I'm doing a family constellation interview, right. I have got my genogram out here and I'm talking about relationships and relationship dynamics, because as an Adlerian, I think that those early relationships speak to and drive how people think about themselves, and the world, and other people. I might be focusing on personal history, personal values, spirituality, all these are things, I could be doing a developmental history, I could be doing an alcohol and drug history, I love to do aggression histories, where I ask clients about, so what was the first time you got in a fight? What's the most recent time you got in a fight? If you were to guess, how many fights have you been in? I've had kids say, uh… maybe 200. I've had kids saying that. Have you ever used a weapon in the fight? What's the worst you've ever hurt somebody? What's the worst that other person has ever hurt you? Some of these. And really interesting kinds of responses that you'll get. I love diving down and doing aggression histories with kids or adults who seem to need that. And of course, all the while, the solution focused person, from the start to the finish, is applying interventions, that's just the way they think about it. The closing stage, includes we move back up to the present. We provide some reassurance and support, thank you for being so open. You only say it if you mean it, you don't want to say it if you don't mean it, you know. Uh… You want to be genuine throughout all this. You might summarize crucial themes and issues. Now one of the things that you might do is, you might do an interactive summary, I might say so, I… I had a friend one time, I was doing a co-therapy with him. And he said, I want to summarize this session and we got four points that we've covered, we covered this, and this, and this, and he goes, all right! He couldn't remember the fourth. So I took from that never number, never number of your summary points, just like yourself, remember what you remember. But do it interactively and collaboratively like, what do you remember? What do you think was important? A lot of times, what is important is what the client thinks was important as opposed to what I thought was important. We're gonna provide an early case formulation. I might say, well, it seems like we've talked over and over again about how you just are pretty hard on yourself. In your own head, you've got this voice said, sort of, crushing, and challenging, and mean. And, uh… if it's okay with you, I would like to focus on that with our counseling going forward. And I… And… And I really think it can help, okay. I think we can make some progress in this area, okay. And tying up loose ends, they're always loose ends. Termination Stage, now we're heading really close to the parting, right. You got to watch the clock. I got to tell you, every time I have forgotten at the beginning of a session to say this is a 50 minute session, we're starting at 2:00, so we're gonna end right about 2:50. I feel rigid saying that, you know, 2:50, you know, it's like, uh… that's just kind of weird. So, sometimes I like to start at 10 after, so that I can end on the hour and start all my appointments 10 after. But it feels kind of rigid, but every time I haven't done it, it's a disaster. People just keep talking and you haven't told them when it ends. You got to tell them when it ends. So, we want to watch the clock, when a guy, you want to manage that termination time, we want to end the session, we got to really stop, sometimes clients will do, you don't opt comments like, oh, by the way, I've been feeling suicidal all week. Well, if it's a crisis, you probably got to have, you know, finish your talk a little more. If it's not a crisis, you say, well, we might talk about that next time. And you want to affirm the plan, when is the next session? Who is the referral to? Provide and sometimes, a written concrete information, uh… it might involve handing out some homework. So, let's look at some examples, two different models, CBT versus solution focused brief therapy. If you're doing CBT, you can see here problem is big, person tiny, functioning medium size. I'm doing CBT. I'm collaboratively genering… generating a problem list, right. I'm listening and looking for maladaptive thoughts and maladaptive behaviors, that's my focus. That's what the CBT'ers, CBT person looks for and listens for. I'm gonna minimize the history. I don't care about the history much, of course, even Judith Beck says though, there are some reasons to go into history. And the number one reason she says, is if the client wants to, okay. And so even CBT people are gonna go into history and the person to some extent. And the main emphasis will be, we're developing an individualized treatment plan so that I can help you with, maybe, the perfectionistic thinking and the harsh negative self-deprecating thoughts that seem to be troubling you. And I'll probably assign you homework that first session, probably self-monitoring. Now if you look at it from the Solution Focus Brief Therapy Model, umm… we're really all interested in functioning, not interested at all in problem, wouldn't even use the word problem, we'll avoid that completely. Goal, we would insert for problem, another person, we're kind of interested in, but not much, mostly the functioning. If I'm doing SFBT, Solution Focused Brief Therapy, I'm beginning with the first session formula task, right. Question, between the time you made your appointment and now, what have you noticed that has changed in a positive direction, okay. It's interesting, sometimes people actually have some things that have changed in a positive direction, that's pretty cool. I'm not gonna collaboratively do a problem list, I'm gonna do a goal list. And it might not be formal, but I might be thinking in my mind, what's the goal, what do you want, and might keep you lingering there as much as possible. I'm gonna minimize the history and the person, I'm gonna look for exceptions and current strengths and solutions, I'm gonna highlight those. When is that, uh… harsh talk to yourself, when is that not happening? Tell me when it's not happening, that's what I'm interested in. And I'm gonna relentlessly focus on the positive and on the goals. So concluding comments, the intake interview, unparalleled, it is the method and it's flexible and it helps us to understand the problem, the person and the current functioning. And that is what our goal is with the intake interview. And that is what's gonna enable us to establish a therapeutic relationship and an initial treatment plan. And I hope your first interviews are not as disastrous as mine was. So, thanks for listening and I'm… I'm wondering if you guys have any questions. 

00:25:50
UNKNOWN I have a question. 

00:25:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Great. 

00:25:50
UNKNOWN You mentioned that you worked with Native Americans and, uh… when you said that, what came to my mind is about the cultural influence and all the work that we do. 

00:26:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. 

00:26:00
UNKNOWN And in particular, how we might address cultural differences. So, I'm wondering if you do that in the intake session, do it at all and if so how would you address that? 

00:26:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, that's a great question. And, of course, culture is ubiquitous and we need to, and I made up a rhyme about this to function… let me see if I can get this, to function to the best of our ability, we need to have multicultural humility. So, beginning of a rap song, umm… but really, what I want to say in response to your question is… is yes and no. Umm… Of course, we want to be open to cultural differences. But in my experience, that if we do that in, sort of, a lock step, sort of, formulaic way, it comes across wrong. You know, I notice that you're a Native American then I wonder, you know it's like, ooh! The person didn't… didn't come up naturally. Now if the person is talking about tribal affiliation or… and, or maybe there are some customs or rituals that are unique to the culture, I can then enter in naturally into being interested in that individual's culture. But for me, to, sort of, as an authoritative person say, we need to talk about our cultural differences, that can come across, I think, wrong. And so, my belief is it needs to come about naturally and authentically in the room as opposed to a formulaic approach I must mention it to every client. So, it's my perspective. 

00:27:25
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:27:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You're welcome. Other question. 

00:27:30
UNKNOWN I have a question. How do you gather information via questionnaires? 

00:27:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, you know, I know a lot of people will have… Adlerians in particular, these long life style questionnaires that they administer prior to the first session. And when that happens and I've seen John Carlson do this, as a demonstration, he's got a boat load of information about the person. And, I think, what I have seen is he uses that information as a way of opening the conversation, chit chatting and giving a really nice sense of familiarity and, you know, he can refer to you put down on this questionnaire that you were the oldest child. Uh… And then use that as a way to explore and what was that like, okay. And he might even say, well, a typical oldest child might experience this, but I wonder if that was the way it was for you. So, it can be a real good entry point, I tend to, umm… sort of like that spontaneous intake interview where I don't have a lot of information. Umm… But when I have had information, I also find that very useful. Thank you, it's a good question. Others? 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, I have a question. I was wondering, how you handle it as a clinician, when, umm… one of the goals is trying to identify the problem and if you feel like the client isn't really talking about their real problem? 

00:28:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Oh, man. You know, that has happened a time or two, in the history of counseling in psychotherapy. And, you know, I think, what we want to do is… uh… that will depend a lot on theoretical orientation and personal preference. But my sense is, we want to be collaborative and so if I think the client is talking about the wrong problem, I'm gonna start with what the client wants and then keep in the back of my mind as a hypotheses, well, maybe we need to get to what I think the problem is to. And eventually, there may be the right time to share that and to talk about that. Uh… But I… I don't want to push my agenda too much because I think that the client won't come back for the second session. 

00:29:40
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:29:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Thank you. 

00:29:40
UNKNOWN I have a quick question. In the intake interview, what happens when it goes to the second session? 

00:29:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:29:50
UNKNOWN Or maybe, the third. 

00:29:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:29:50
UNKNOWN Like, when do you stop the intake and go into counseling? 

00:29:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, yeah, and you know, I would say it's not necessarily, umm… uh… like a lock step thing. Where okay, now we're done with the intake, then we're gonna start counseling, although it might be, if you just do a single session intake and then you start counseling. I have a standard second session question. Umm… And second session question is what do you remember and what did you find important about our first meeting? I might follow that up, but is there is anything that you thought about between our first and second session that was related to our meeting? Because I wonder what was important to the client as opposed to what was important to me and that's gonna to help with the formulation and treatment plan. Uh… But I would say, a lot of times it's just a sort of a continuous process. And uh… you, sort of just move from that intake into starting to do counseling and sometimes you do that half way through the first session. And sometimes you might get to the third session and it feels like you've been gathering information and now finally you can get to being more therapeutic. So, I think it really depends and I think that's a… that's why that's such a great question. So… So, you guys, thank you so much for listening and for the fabulous questions.
