 This is session is Strengths-Based Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Making a Positive Difference. Uhm, Michael Monion(ph) and I'm gonna be introducing our speaker, ah, who is Christine Padesky and I'm gonna take a moment just to tell you that Christine and I have known each other for nearly 20 years maybe, ah, and, and to take the second to say I've notice a whole lot of young practitioners here, ah, and, and I'm just so encouraged by seeing what I'm seeing. Ah, what I want you to know is that brilliance goes a long way in this field, ah, but she's really just this very lovely person and I want you all to remember, if you really wanna succeed, be a lovely person like Christine Padesky.

Strengths-Based CBT Making a Positive Difference 

00:01:00
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY That's one of the kindest introductions I've received. Thank you very much. Ah, let me get my slides up here. It's my, ah, great pleasure to talk to you today about Strengths-Based CBT especially here at the Evolution Conference. I actually had the honor of teaching with Aaron T. Beck, Tim Beck at the very first Evolution Conference in Phoenix. He invited me to co-present with him and I was at that conference, so very nervous cuz I think I was probably the youngest person presenting at the conference. And I stayed up all much of the night the night before my presentation and I ended up to, ah, speaking on, ah, teaching by mistakes, ah, and that was the most comfortable thing for me to do at that young age was to just identify my mistakes and what I could learn from them. Today and I'm going to have the pleasure of f-- walking you through the evolution of what I'm now calling Strengths-Based CBT and this is a model of CBT that has drawn out of the tradition of my work with Aaron T. Beck but in collaboration with Kathleen Mooney. Ah, over the past 30 years we have developed a variation on cognitive therapy that is very strengths-based and it was actually Tim Beck who encouraged me to actually give a title to it. I said, "Well, I always just call what I do cognitive therapy, Tim, because most of what I've learned, I've learned from you." And he said, "Yes, but you are doing it in your own signature way now and you should put a name on it that people can associate with you." So, ah, I have done that and today I'm gonna follow you-- with you the arc of the development of what we call Strengths-Based CBT. Let me begin by saying, ah, what Strengths-Based CBT is.

00:03:10
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY If I could get my slides up and, ah, if for the next few slides you could keep them up. We actually mean three things by Strengths-Based CBT. The first thing we mean is that when we're doing evidence-based treatments for difficulties where there's depression or anxiety or psychosis or any of the problems that we now have good evidence-based treatments for, we really believe that you get further, faster if you identify and incorporate strengths throughout the treatment. I'm gonna be talking a bit about what in the early years of my career, the first decade or so, ah, what some of the contributions were that, ah, I tried to add to the knowledge base that help us do that. 

00:04:00
CBT Models to Build Positive Qualities Use Existing Strengths 

00:04:00
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY The second thing that's evolved over the years is Kathleen Mooney and I came up with the idea CBT so effective at helping people with problems, couldn't we use some of the same treatment methods to actually help people build positive qualities. So this is-- the second of phase of our development is showing how we could identify and use existing strengths that clients have to actually help them develop positive qualities in their life like resilience or compassion or other things. 

00:04:35
NEW Models for Chronic Issues Construct NEW Strengths 

00:04:35
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY And the third thing that we mean by Strengths-Based CBT is I've been interested over the entire course of my career in treating chronic difficulty such as personality disorders. It really hurts me as a young graduate student when supervisors would tell me, "Don't try so hard with this client. They have borderline personality disorder and your-- the best you can do is just help them be more comfortable in their lives." I, I thought that was the most terrible thing a supervisor would ever said to me. And I used that upset in my part to motivate myself to try to develop better treatments for personality disorders cuz I always believed that people can always change and they can always learn, ah, new ways to be in the world. And so, over the last 20 years, we've developed a new model for working with chronic issues like personality disorders, ah, which I will mention briefly today. And this new model is very Strengths-Based and it revolves around helping people construct new strengths and learn to operate and be in the world in new ways. So, our Strengths-Based CBT has evolved in its very nature over the last 35 years and, ah, I'll show you some of those highlights. Let me just start with the early years in terms of how did I start to identify and incorporate strengths. When I was a graduate student at UCLA, in my first year, we were asked to identify something we want to do a research on that we could work on over the next four years of graduate school. And I told the faculty I really wanted to not really look at clinical issues, I wanted to look at how is it that most people cope really well so that they don't get depressed and anxious. Well, I was so excited about this idea but I have to tell you there wasn't a single faculty member who shared my excitement. They said, "No, the things we study here are depression, autism," and they went through a list. So I ended up, ah, studying depression with Connie Hammen which turned out to be so fortuitous or may because she and I wrote a paper that was published in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology on gender differences in the Beck Depression Inventory and Dr. Beck saw that paper and contacted us and said, "Hey, we're developing this new therapy at Philadelphia," this was in 1978. "Can I send you a pre-treatment manual and have you look it over and tried out if you like," and that was how I got introduced to cognitive therapy.

What is Strengths-Based CBT? Evidence-Based CBT Treatments Identify & Incorporate Strengths 7-column thought record © 1983 Christine A. Padesky, PhD 

00:07:15
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY So it turned out to be a very lucky thing for me in the long although I was very disappointed that no one was interested in studying positive coping. Now, as I started to use cognitive therapy with the, ah, Dr. Beck's approach, I had to learn to master a thought record that he had introduced and he had a five-column thought record which had thoughts, feelings, ah, well, it had situation, feelings, thoughts, and then at the fourth column was rational response. Now, one of the things about Strengths-Based CBT is language matters. The language we use with our clients impacts their view of themselves and their understanding of how we view them. And from the very first few months of-- even though I was nuts, crazy about cognitive therapy, that column of the thought record rational response really bothered me because this was a therapy that was meant to be empirical and yet when people would write down their depressed thoughts, the next column said rational response which somehow implied the-- their depressed thoughts were irrational. And also it's not really a very kind, compassionate thing to say to people, I didn't think. So I started crossing the name of that column out and writing in alternative balance thought and I would work with my clients and my clients started telling me that they got-- they found the thought record much more useful when we were working on it in session together than when they did it at home for homework. And I said, "Why do you think that is?" and they said, "Well, when we're work on it in session, you ask me lots of questions and you review with me s-- information from my life and so by the time we get to that alternative balance thoughts column, I'm already thinking about lots of experiences that supported new point of view and I believe it more and I feel better but when I go home and I've written down a negative thought like I'm no good and I get to that fourth column, I just write in, I suppose I am good. But I haven't reviewed all those experiences in my life. So this is what led me to develop the seven-column thought record and the seven-column thought record, ah, which later, ah, Dennis Greenberger and I, ah, wrote the book Mind Over Mood to teach people how to use it, ah, we embedded in it this language of alternative balance thought and we embedded in it two columns. I embedded in it two columns - evidence that supports your hot thought, evidence that doesn't support your hot thought. And the reason I did this is because I want clients to have the skills without therapists help to do what will help them feel better. I really see therapy as all about helping people acquire skills that can help them live happier lives. And so, I made this change and, ah, clients liked it a lot better and, ah, the rest was history as they say. So, this was one of the first innovations that I added to the cognitive therapy model. 

00:10:35
5 Part Model (Padesky & Mooney, 1986) BEHAVIOR BODY MOOD MIND ENVIRONMENT 

00:10:40
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY A few years later, ah, Kathleen Mooney and I were talking about how to best explain the cognitive model to clients and the cognitive model is all about connections between thoughts and feelings and physiological reactions and moods but also we wanted to recognize that people exist in contacts in environments both historical, cultural environment, and also current environments. It's much different if somebody says, "I'm worthless," and they're in an environment that's quite positive and supportive and they're doing well and it's-- from someone who says I'm worthless and they're living in an environment where people are constantly telling them they're worthless and bullying them. So, we've decided to add environment to the model as we presented it to clients and this was such a little thing but to be honest I get more re-print request from our small article we wrote on presenting the five-part model. I get more re-print request and more request from people writing books who wanna include this model, ah, in their books than probably almost any other thing I've written. So, I think the idea of being sensitive to contacts in environment is also very important. 

00:11:55
Socratic Dialogue (1993) Information Q's Empathic Listening Summaries Analytic / Synthesizing Q's 

00:11:55
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY In line with my wanting to empower clients, ah, in the late, ah, '80s I-- and the early '90s, I began to try to figure out h-- what is the Socratic questioning or Socratic dialogue that we do with clients and I developed a four-step model, ah, which I presented for the first time in London in 1993 at a (inaudible ) for Dr. Beck. And my teaching of the four stages of Socratic method have been very helpful to therapist in doing cognitive therapy very better but I have to tell you one of the reasons that I developed this model was because I think when we use Socratic dialogue, we empower our clients. I really have always wanted to get away from a model where therapist is guru or where therapist is this wise person who guides you through your life. I want to adopt a model where a therapist is someone who's a collaborator who sits next to you, who really cares about you and is concerned about you and wants to help you figure out what's the best way forward in your own life in a very individual way and then in a way that is gonna empower the client. And I found that by doing Socratic dialogue, clients begin to have more ownership of new beliefs that were developed in therapy. So, I would ask clients informational questions about their own experience, ah, we listen for the meaning and what they said and didn't say, and really importantly I'd write-- have them write down a written summary of key learning ideas throughout the session and then the most important part of Socratic dialogue in my mind is after you have a written summary. Instead of you saying, "Well, I think what we can learn from this week is such and so," instead of that we ask the client an analytic synthesizing question and the most common ones that I ask are, you know, how do you relate what we-- what you've just written down and what we've been talking about this week to this belief we started out the session talking about. Or really another good analytic synthesizing question is, you know, when you look at what you've written down from what we've talked about today, how could you use this ideas to help yourself this week? Such a simple question and yet it transforms the nature of therapy from the nature of expert student to one of really respectful collaborators and allies which is what I've always tried to model in the therapy that I do. 

00:14:30
Evidenced-Based Models Depression More Models Anxiety Disorders Eating Disorders Personality Disorders Psychosis Addictions Etc 

00:14:35
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY Now, while I was developing this and trying to fine-tune some these processes in cognitive therapy, ah, the field was growing by leaps and bounds. Ah, I started as a cognitive therapist in 1978 which makes me one of the oldest and longest standing cognitive therapist in the world. Ah, and, ah, Tim Beck, when we were having lunch last month in Philadelphia said, "You're the first cognitive therapist outside of Philadelphia." I actually don't think that's true but I was certainly one of the earliest cognitive therapist outside of Philadelphia. When I first learn cognitive therapy we just had one model and one book, Cognitive Therapy of Depression. I really feel empathy for students today because the field has grown, there's now hundreds of books on all these different topics and it can feel quite overwhelming. And throughout the '80s I had the benefit of learning models as they got developed and new models began to be developed about each of the anxiety disorders and eating disorders and personality disorders. I had a role in developing some of these models, ah, most of them I just had the good fortune as a clinician working with diverse clients both children and adults, ah, of-- each time these models would come along I'd say, "Oh that's why I'm not making progress with this client," and so I would learn the new model that was being developed and find that my way in therapy was much easier after I learned an evidence-based treatment. 

00:16:15
CBT for Social Anxiety Assertive Defense of the Self 1997 Disorders Relapse Strengths 

00:16:15
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY Ah, I did, during this time period, make some of my own contributions, ah, in terms of models. One of them-- some of you came to a workshop that I taught, ah, two days ago on a sort of defense of the self as a treatment for social anxiety. Ah, I developed that in 1997, ah, I actually, uhm, also had a role in developing the cognitive model, that classic CBT model for treating personality disorders prior to us developing our own model in later years. So, as the field begin to develop, ah, a change happened. We started looking at how to develop evidence-based treatments for various disorders but by the 1990s a lot of the emphasis in our training had really shifted to preventing relapse. We began to see that many different therapist can successfully treat depression and some of the anxiety disorders. But that-- one of the edges that CBT had is that we tended to have lower relapse and so people started wondering is this and relating it to some of the skills that clients were learning. Ah, that's kinda where the field still is in terms of looking at relapse but as the millennium dawned, ah, we begin to think, "Why couldn't we use the same principles to build strengths?" And since 2000, this is really where we've been putting our concerted effort at developing a Strengths-Based CBT Model. One of the books that was published a few years ago that I co-wrote with Willem Kuyken and Rob Dudley was called Collaborative Case Conceptualization and this was, to my knowledge, the first book in CBT where we, in the very beginning, talked about the importance of identifying strengths in the intake interview and incorporating strengths in the case conceptualization and treatment planning across the course of treatment. So, we-- having this book laid out a model for doing this.

00:18:20

00:18:25
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY As I said, we also beginning to think as more and more models to treat disorders came up and, in fact, I think at some point, it, it was probably liter-- it probably was literally true that anything that there was a disorder for-- DSM IV, we had a CBT treatment model for it with varying levels of evidence supporting those treatments, ah, but I begin to think what if we use these models to build positive qualities and so this led to the second phase of development of Strengths-Based CBT which is actually is saying, "Let's use CBT methods to build positive qualities." Actually, when I look on my website, I-- the earliest paper that I have published related to this was, ah, in 1989 I published, ah, a paper I'm quite proud of because I think it was the very first CBT Book Chapter that addressed, ah, lesbian, gay, bisexual issues. It was a paper called attaining and maintaining positive identity, positive lesbian identity, and it talked about-- you can get it on our website, in our-- we have a section of our website called clinical corner where we have publications and you can get a free re-print of many of the publications I've written there. And this was the first paper where I talked about how you could use CBT methods to help people develop positive attitudes about themselves. And it wasn't to treat any dysfunction because, ah, luckily the field had started to move away from the idea that, ah, lesbian and gay people have path-- pathology just because of who they love and we were beginning to move in the more of an era of acceptance and when I look back at that paper now I, uhm, you know, the languages are, you know, maybe a little bit outdated, some of it. But I'm really proud of the fact that it was one of the first articles that really anticipated what later became known as affirmative psychotherapy as part of the American Psychological Association standards in terms of how to LGBTQ, ah, clients. So, ah, that was probably the first paper I ever wrote on you-- building positive qualities and it just had to do with positive self-identity.

00:20:55
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY We later, ah, began to try to develop a cognitive model on how could we use CBT methods to really generate positive qualities into building strengthened positive qualities and we were thinking about what to do this on, ah, in the second week of September 2001 and Kathleen and I actually had a meeting plan to sit down and say what's gonna be our next model, what are we gonna work on. Ah, when the Twin Towers were attacked and the Pentagon were attacked and, ah, we had, uhm, the plane would down in Pennsylvania so our country was in the midst of this crisis and we were planning a week-long intensive training on a new topic is yet to be determined and as we sat in our office processing what was going on around us and thinking about our own reactions, we said, "Well, one thing that's gonna be in-- on everyone's mind in the coming years is resilience. Let's see if we can build a mod-- we can come about creating and constructing a model to build and strengthen resilience." And, ah, we did and we ended up coming up with a four-step model to build resilience and this four-step model was really interesting and I wanna just highlight some of the differences from traditional, ah, CBT for disorders. Ah, when we're coming up with the model to understand depression, anxiety, eating disorders, substance misuse, whatever it is that we're working on, if you read the literature you'll see one of the characteristics is that people coming up with very neat, clean, linear kind of models. You know, this happens and it-- I mean, it may be multiple pathways so like with depression, we know that biology and cognition and behavior and, again, in people's lives can all converge. But then it's like once you get ended depression, depression in one person looks very much like depression in another person. If you take people with social anxiety, everybody with social anxiety has very-- has cognitions and common behaviors in common. If you look at bulimia, everyone with bulimia has certain cognitions, moods, behaviors in common. What's very interesting to us about building positive qualities is that there are multiple pathways to get there. This is such good news. It's not like there's one way to be resilient. There are million and one ways to be resilient. There are perhaps 7 billion ways to be resilient. So this was really interesting. 

00:23:45
4 STEPS TO BUILD RESILIENCE 2002 Search Construct Apply Practice 

00:23:45
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY The other thing that was very interesting to us is when we look at disorders, we really always looking at very higher order processes and those of you who are at my dialogue, ah, yesterday with Martin Seligman, ah, you heard me talk with him about, ah, in much of the positive psychology literature in his writing when people talk about strengths. They're usually looking at this pretty high order Strengths, Strengths with a capital "S", you know, courage, altruism, you know, really broad abstract qualities of strengths and then they're looking at evidence of these strengths in people. Well, Kathleen and I approached in from a very different angle because I believe, first of all I believe, every person on the planet has strengths, many strengths. There's not a single client that you sit with who doesn't have strengths. I was-- and how do you find these strengths? Kathleen and I asked ourselves and you might think, well, you might look for what are the most difficult things people have gone through in their lives and how do they get through those difficult times. But actually we found, for therapy, for the creative processes of therapy, the best place to look for strength is in everyday positive experiences, everyday positive experiences. So, we begin to ask clients things like what do you enjoy doing? If you have an extra hour in your week, I know how rare that is, but if you did, if you had an extra hour on your week and you could spend it doing anything you wanted, what would you wanna do during that hour. Tell me something you do everyday that's a bit of a bright spot in your day and it doesn't have to be a big thing. For some people it might be making a cup of tea at the end of the day, for other people it might be taking their dog for a walk, for other people it might be a hobby that they have. What we have found is that the best place to look for strengths and the best place to look in this instance for resilience is in everyday positive activities and in terms of resilience, the reason that's a good place to look is when people are doing a positive activity people exhibit lots of strengths with-- without effort, they don't even try. If you have something you really like to do, you try lots of strengths when you're doing that thing but you don't think about it. You also are highly resilient when you're doing that and yet you don't connect resilience with doing that pleasant activity. But let me show you how it is linked. 

00:26:45
4 STEPS TO BUILD RESILIENCE 2002 Search Construct Apply Practice 

00:26:50
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY We then do a search for strengths and the way we do that with resilience is we say, "When you're doing this thing you really like, when you're walking your dog, what are some of the obstacles you place-- you, you face"? So, first, we chat with them for five or 10 minutes about their dog, what your dog's name, what kind of dog is it, how long have you had your dog, what is the cutest thing your dog does, do you have a picture of your dog. So we get very curious and immerse ourselves in that positive activity of their life and then we say to them, "Ah, what are some of the obstacles you face in walking your dog?" And they'll say, "Obstacles?" Because when we're doing positive activities we don't even think about obstacles. I say, "Yeah, I'm sure some things happen like maybe you're going down a certain neighborhood and there's another dog and they're off leash and they're kind of barking and starling or maybe it's raining outside and you wanna take your dog for a walk but it's icy and sliddy and snowy. And so we identify obstacles and then we ask people, "How do you handle that?" Now, the interesting thing is if it's a positive activity not connected to the client's problem that they're in therapy for, clients have all kinds of creative ways of solving issues because it's something they like to do. And so we then, with this, we go on a search for this positive activities or what we call strengths and we construct with them a personal model of resilience of how they handle obstacles within this positive area and then we actually formally construct it as a personal model or resilience and we apply to it to areas of difficulty of their life and have them practice being resilient. 

00:28:30
4 STEPS TO BUILD RESILIENCE 2002 Search Construct Apply Practice 

00:28:30
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY And it's interesting when you have people practice being resilient is quite different from traditional CBT cuz in traditional CBT, we're trying to solve problems. In resilience work, we're saying to the client, "You know, two things could happen. A problem could come up and you might solve it or fix it in some way. Or if not, you have an opportunity to practice being resilient. Wouldn't that be lucky?" And so clients says what's nice about adding the resilience work to traditional CBT is whatever happens in their life, they've got two good outcomes. One good outcome is they can handle the difficulty. The other good outcome is that difficulty remains in making feel good about themselves standing up and staying resilient in the face of whatever it is. And actually continuing to feel good about themselves. 

00:29:25
Resilience: Areas of Competence Davis 1999 Physical Social/Relational Cognitive Emotional Moral Spiritual 

00:29:25
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY Now, I said earlier there-- we found there are multiple pathways to resilience and Nancy Davis did a review of the literature, ah, back in 1999 that highlighted six different areas in our life, ah, that people draw resilience from and what's been delightful for me is no two people need to be resilient in the same way. Some people are highly resilient out of, ah, sense of spiritual, ah, oneness with the rest of humanity and, ah, and they do a lot of volunteer work and, ah, when they, when they have pain, chronic pain, they say, "Well, I'm not the only one. Many people struggle with this," and that allows them to be resilient. Other people are very creative problem solvers and they have good sense of humor and there are yet other people who are really good at in listing help from other people and they get a lot of interpersonal support in times of difficulty. The wonderful thing is is that we can help people find out what their personal style is and what their-- how they personally are most resilient and we can support that and they don't have to be-- have strengths in all of these areas. One of the things in teaching therapists' model that I found is that we need to be very careful as therapist because as therapists we often have biases about where we look for strengths. CBT therapists often have a bias of looking for strengths in the cognitive realm of problem solving, in emotion management, in behavioral skills, and therapists often neglect looking in the areas of spirituality whether it's a formal faith-based spirituality or whether it's, ah, a human spirituality that are important to people. Many people find resilience and strengths through their values, their positive values in life and to neglect that, do not ask about that is a real-- does our clients real disservice. So, in my workshops when I teach this resilience model, I have therapists take the clients that they see as low res-- low in resilience that they think do not have strengths and I have therapists rate their clients in these six areas and therapists are always stunned to find out that some of the clients they rate as low in resilience either they do have strengths in areas that the therapist hasn't typically valued or they have no idea if the client has strengths in some of these areas cuz they've never even thought to ask. So, one of the things that, ah, Strengths-Based CBT does is it gets us to start to take a much broader view of people and to show curiosity and interest in many more areas of people's lives.

What is Strengths-Based CBT? Evidence-Based CBT Treatments Identify & Incorporate Strengths CBT Models to Build Positive Qualities Use Existing Strengths NEW Models for Chronic Issues Construct NEW Strengths 

00:33:05
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY So, let me go on to the third area that we've been working on and that's developing new models for working on chronic issues. I told you I've been a CBT therapist for many, many years and I have to say 30 years ago, 25 years ago, even 20 years ago, when I work with clients with chronic problems and I did work a lot with-- people with personality disorders, I worked with many clients with borderline personality disorder, and when I was using classic CBT methods and at that time, 20 years ago, it would be identifying negative thoughts that lead to cutting behavior or identifying negative thoughts that contribute to depression, dysphoria, loneliness, core interpersonal relationships and testing this out, it took a very long time. And like many of you probably experience, how many of you have had the experience if you've done any CBT of looking for evidence that doesn't support the idea that somebody is worthless or unlovable or one of these core beliefs that goes with personality disorders or looking for evidence that people aren't trustworthy? How many of you have found that you can come up with hundreds of bits of evidence and the client say to you, "I see that evidence but I still know that I'm unlovable"? How many of have had that experience? If you just follow classic CBT with, ah, chronic difficulties, one of the things you run into is that clients have well-worn stories and you can end up over and over again every session going over the same information and if you do that with clients it's like they-- you get into a rut with them and the rut just gets deeper and deeper and deeper week by week. And you start to look in your calendar and say, "Oh! So and so again." If you're not making progress with clients and if it feels like you're in a rut that's just getting deeper, that's an indication that maybe you need to do something different and out of that concern, ah, over the years, ah, I started coming up with an idea and the idea that I came up with, I actually remember the day I had it I was driving to the office and I was so excited as I thought of it, ah, that by I got into my office I immediately picked up the phone and I called Dr. Beck cuz he and I were good friends at by that time. And I said, "Tim--" you know, we've been talking in our research groups, in our clinical book groups about why does it take so long to treat personality disorders cuz by this point we were s-- you know, we've been spoiled by rapid success with depression and anxiety. So some therapists were saying, "Gee, why does it take so long to treat personality disorders?" And I said, "Tim, I, I, I, I think I've-- we've been asking the wrong question." And he said, "What do you mean?" And I, I said, "Well, I think the question should be why can we treat depression and anxiety so quickly," because I had gotten a minor in graduate school, I was specializing clinical psychology predominantly but I got a minor in social psychology at UCLA when I was there, there are a lot of people doing research on attitude change and expectations. And so I knew well that if people had a belief as people do when they're depressed, I'm no good, I'm worthless, you can't easily change a belief like that. It takes-- should take a long time to change that belief and yet we were working with depressed people and in 10, 12 sessions they will start out saying, "I'm no good. I believe that 100%," and in 10, 12 sessions they were saying, "Oh, that was just the depression speaking. I know I'm a good person. I've strengths. I've got qualities, positive qualities." So, I said, "Why is it that people with depression and anxiety can change these deep beliefs so quickly?" It's the people with personality disorders who are acting the right way. If we have deeply held beliefs, they should be very difficult to change. And Tim, of course, had the, you know, he knew the answer to it cuz he'd a written a book about it in 1968 and I knew that he'd a written a book about it in 1968 which is why I was calling him and talking and he said, "Well, it's because we had paired core beliefs." All of us sometimes feel worthless and sometimes feel worthwhile. If we have good mental health, having both beliefs is part of good mental health, it's equally dangerous to just feel that you're a wonderful person and not have any sense that you have flaws. That gets you into this much trouble as seeing yourself as a deeply flawed person with no wonderful aspect. So, all of us have paired beliefs. I said, "What if the reason therapy takes as long as it should with personality disorders is because people have the negative core belief but they never really fully formed strong positive core beliefs?" Tim said that makes a lot of sense and I said, "Then, we need to change our treatment," and this was the beginning of our new paradigm for personality disorders. Kathleen and I have gone very radical on this notion. I wrote a paper about it.

"Construct new, more adaptive schemas..." Padesky (1994) Flex OLD NEW Padesky, C.A. (1994) Sches change processes in cognitive therapy. Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy. An International Journal of Theory and Practice, I (5).267-278. 

00:38:40
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY I can get the slide. In 1994 it was published called, ah, Schema Change Processes in Cognitive Therapy and in this paper I argue that when we're treating personality disorders or other chronic issues that our emphasis should be on building new beliefs not dismantling old beliefs. In fact, there is nothing wrong with people seeing themselves as unlovable and worthless. As long as they have the flexibility to also see themselves as lovable and worthwhile. And so, we started on this path which over the last 20 years has now developed into a full treatment which I'm, ah, hoping to get some research money in the coming year to begin some trials and out of that will come a treatment manual which isn't yet written. But we have developed this method which I've actually been teaching in workshops for the past decade and consulting with many therapist are using this approach and getting really good outcomes with their clients with personality disorders. 

00:39:40
NEW PARADIGM 2004 Conceptualize OLD 

00:39:40
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY And what this treatment method is is it's very different from clascsic CBT for personality disorders. Instead, it's a four-step model that radically focuses on building new beliefs and the first step of the model is we have developed structured interviews where in one session, ah, we actually don't start at this point of therapy. We actually treat at least one problem that people come to therapy for that's causing distress or depression, anxiety, bulimia, whatever they're coming to therapy for. We do an evidence-based treatment for that. First, in the course of that evidence-based treatment we're identifying strengths and incorporating strengths into the treatment so it's a very strengths focused classic CBT. We then, when we're switching to work on the personality issues themselves, we have a structured interview that helps people conceptualize their old system of operating in the world. Now, you remember at the beginning I said, "Language is really important." Notice what we do with people. We conceptualize what's currently going in their relationships and we have actually a worksheet we use with them and it-- and we refer to it as the old system. This is the language change. We take what it is and we call it old. 

00:41:05
Construct NEW 

00:41:10
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY We then go into the very next session. We have a structured interview where we help people construct a new view, a new system of how they would like to be in their relationships because all personality source have to do with relationship disruption and difficulties. Now, it's in constructing this new system that we've discovered that we have to use all kinds of new therapy methods and I'm gonna be talking about those, ah, with some guiding slides in just a minute what are the new methods that are part of this constructed new systems, new paradigm work that we do. 

00:41:50
Strengthen NEW Relapse management → 

00:41:50
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY Ah, once we help them and it usually takes just one or two sessions to construct a new system of how they'd like to be, most of the therapy is then spent, ah, strengthening this new system. By getting them to go out and do behavioral experiments and in therapy we do behavioral experiments where they try to bring on this new way of being like a coat of, like a coat or piece of clothes. Young people-- 10 years ago I used to talk to them about Happy Potter's invisibility cloak that they could have a new system, cloak, that they pull on and then they enter a situations and start behaving in a new way. We do not spend time testing out the negative beliefs that maintain their dysfunctional personality. We spend our time on getting them to envision and practice and behave interpersonally in ways that fit with their new system and we debrief these experiments through the new systems. So when the client comes back and says, "I don't know why you told me I should have that conversation with my friend, they got really mad at me. This is a stupid new system. I don't like this new system. It gets me in trouble. My old system kept me safe," and this w-- part of our language as we, we say, "You're doing things in your old system to keep you safe and protected. We all do go-- things for good reasons." When a client with borderline personality disorder attacks us in therapy, they are doing that for good reasons and we talk to them, we say, "You know, you're, you know, I can tell you're really upset with me right now. And I know you must have good reasons for that. What have I done to hurt you? Is there something going on that's scaring you?" And so, we talk about good reasons for the old system and how the old system set up to protect us and keep us safe and so the clients will come in. If they do a new system experiment that doesn't turn out as they hoped it would, they sometimes come in angry with the new system. They said, "My old system kept me safe. I hate this new system," and then we say to them, we process it cuz as a therapist we teach therapists to stay within the new system or within the clients' hope for what they want within the new system and we would process it with the clients and say, "You know, let me first-- let's back this up. First of all, before you talk to your friend, were you in the new system? Did you get in to the new system?" "Yes, I did. I was-- I reviewed my notes, my worksheet. I was in the new system." "Good for you. That's so good. And then what happened with your friend, I'm, I'm-- I feel so sad. I'm so sorry it turned out that way. You and I didn't anticipate that that could happen." I wonder what was going on. It almost sounds to me like your friend was in an old system of their own." "Oh, I didn't think about-- you mean, other people have old systems?" "Absolutely. We all have old systems to protect us and keep us safe but your experience tells us we don't enough in this new system. We wanna make sure there's stuff in this new system to protect you and get-- keep you safe. And, you know, we didn't anticipate what to do when your friend gets really angry at you. Let's put some things in the new system that would allow you to be the way you want to be that-- but that would keep you safe when your friend is attacking you and saying mean things." So we work with people, ah, on strengthening and making the new system more elaborate, more flexible, ah, and we develop a new system until clients get to the point that they could be in the new system most of the time and then they're ready for relapse management planning and we help them prepare for how they can use this new system the rest of their life.

Central Therapy Methods Questions Active Tests Constructive Questions & Actions 

00:45:40
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY Now, I wanna talk a bit about some of the therapy changes we have to make to do this kind of developing and constructing new beliefs, new behaviors, ah, from a CBT perspective. Ah, in CBT there's been this evolution over time. We started out in the early books. Mostly, it was-- the focus was on Socratic questioning and there was a lot of talk about questions. Those of you who followed the development of the field know that in the last 20 years, there's been an increased emphasis on behavioral experiments and very active test and I did a clinical demonstration this morning of behavioral experiments, this active test of beliefs. With strengths-- when we're constructing new belief systems, new ideas, we wanna use constructive questions and actions and even though I never studied solution focus therapy or mo-- motivational interview in any formal way, ah, a lot of the constructive questions are like this so when someone comes in and says, "You know, I got back into my old system and I got so upset and I pushed my friend away." In classic CBT we might say, "What was going to your mind when you got angry? What was going to your mind that made you push your friend away?" and we'd focus on the maintaining negative beliefs. In our paradigm, we would say, "What do you wish you would have done instead? What would that have felt like? What could you do to help yourself remember to do that next time?" So we ask constructive questions and we get our clients to do constructive actions to try to continuously improve and move closer and closer to how they want to be. 

00:47:35
A Smile ... and the amygdala 

00:47:35
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY There's also a couple of things that we have to do differently as therapists and one of the main things that we have to do different when we're helping people construct new ways of being in therapy is we have to develop an ability to smile really well. Because when we're talking to people about distress and disorder, we typically don't smile very much and it's good not to smile. We're being empathic and concerned. But when we turn to helping people construct new ways of being, if we don't smile, we are pairing a positive verbal effort with a negative nonverbal effort and we're not gonna get anywhere. So if I say to you, "Okay, so, that didn't go well. You pushed your friend away. What do you wish you had done instead?" Looking very concerned, "What happens?" You feel a little bit tied, a little bit uncertain what to say. You, you may end up saying, "I don't know." And anytime you client say "I don't know" when you ask them a positive question, I'm gonna make a guess, there's a high likelihood you're not smiling. Compare that with if I say, "I'm sorry you have that experience when you push your friend away. What do you wish you had done instead?" You feel the difference. Hope, curiosity, what do you wish you had done instead? So, with clients, we have to start thinking about a smile as a therapeutic intervention and I now do it so reflexively, you know, clients come in and say, "I had a very tough week," and I, I say when I'm doing new paradigm work, "Oh, I'm very sorry. Ah, tell me what happened?" So, uhm, you know, typical classic therapy cuz we're talking about negative stuff and they'll say, "Well, you know, it's really hard for this and that," and I'll say, "Okay," and I'll say, "And I'm curious. Did you have the chance to practice any of your new system this week?" Smile comes on and they'll say, "Well, actually I got into the old system." Now, here I have a choice point. I could say, "Oh, you got into the old system. Tell me what happened?" But I've already introduced new system and if I'm really working in the new paradigm with someone, I'll say, "Oh, you did the old system came up to protect you, did it? Tell me what happened and let's see if we can figure out what you could have done in the new system." 

00:50:25
A Smile ... and the amygdala 

00:50:25
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY And so, we are learning to use the therapeutic and on the slide it says "A smile and the amygdala" and one of the evidence basis for the importance of smiling is that when clients get scared, we have amygdala in our brain, right there. Our amygdala are danger sensors. Very old brain systems that perceive danger before we can even name it. It's your amygdala that if you're out doing a nice walk in the woods and dust earths to come and you hear a little snap or even you don't hear a snap of a twig but all of a sudden you get a shiver up your spine, you start feeling anxious, that's your amygdala. Our amygdala is constantly scanning for danger. Now, when our amygdala get activated, we do not learn as well, we're not as creative, we, ah, tend to shutdown and have a narrowing of focus. Now with people with personality disorders, how often in session do you think their amygdala is act-- or activated? Constantly. So this is one of the reasons when we do our new paradigm work I'm actually working with therapists, you know, they developed really good smile muscles because when we're doing new paradigm work and reconstructing new systems and talking about how we could be, we're smiling throughout most of the session because there was a footnote we read in a biological neuropsychology paper that said one of the-- there's two things that quiet the amygdala very quickly. One is novelty and the other is the human smile. So when I'm working with pers-- people with personality disorders, every opportunity I have to smile, a genuine smile that has a twinkle in my eye, it's not inappropriate empathically to what the client's currently saying so we go back and forth. "Oh, I'm sorry that happened this week. Let's talk about what we could figure out to help that go better for you this week." So I'm going back and forth and smiling as much as I can. So one of the new changes in Strengths-Based CBT is we're teaching therapist how to use smiling as an impo-- portant therapy intervention. Another very important therapy intervention is silence. Silence is an intervention that hasn't been emphasized much in CBT but when we're asking people to imagine how they'd like to be, you can't just say to someone, "How would you like to be? What in your heart-- what's really there?" If you could imagine yourself and your relationships being anyway, the best way possible, how would you like them to be?" You can't rapid-fire answer that question. We're also using lots of positive imagery, getting people to tune into the kinesthetics and the body sense of how do they feel when they're in the new systems. 

00:53:35
Rational Epstein (1998), Kahneman (2011) Experiential 

00:53:35
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY We're doing lots of different work because we're working in what, ah, Kahneman and-- Tversky and Kahneman and later Epstein have talked about, about the two minds. When we're working with things like depression and anxiety and more short-term acute problems and when we're working at the automatic thought level, we can use rational discourse and makeshift and belief. But when we're working at the level of chronic, reflexive reactions to things, that grows out of what's called the experiential mind and the best way to make changes in the experiential mind are to make changes, ah, in the language that people understand and this is where our work begins to blend with some of the work of other people at this conference even though we have a different theoretical frame. But we're doing lots of positive imagery because the experiential mind remembers imagery, narration, story, metaphor all connected with excitement, curiosity, and the human smile. 

00:54:50
Imagery Positive imagery Words ↓ Meaning 

00:54:50
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY So in this way our understanding of meaning has shifted over the last 35 years in cognitive behavioral therapy, in cognitive therapy. We started out with heavy focus on words even though I remember Tim Beck back in the early years always talk to me about imagery but most people never heard him talk about imagery in the sense that people never remember that part of his message. So, in the early years, people we're all tied up in word thoughts. In recent years, we're having much more research in CBT, in post-traumatic stress disorder, and the different anxiety disorders and even in depression and finding that clients' imagery is the hottest thought of all. And so we're doing a lot more work even in classic CBT with the imagery. We now are introducing to the field the emphasis of incorporating positive imagery in getting people to actively imagine how they would like to be, what they would like to do, how they would be liking other people to respond to them. Because there is a, a growing field of research on the positive psychology and cognitive psychology that when people imagine themselves doing something, they are, in fact, much more likely to do that. Many of you already know that and you've been using that in your practice for years. We're trying to develop better and better and clearer and more straightforward models of how to do with people in ways that anchor it in their experience and is likely to increase their behavior, their positive behavior, positive emotions, and positive belief systems. 

00:56:25
Test Drive NEW Beliefs & Behaviors 

00:56:25
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY We need people to actively and often testdrive new beliefs and behaviors in order for this to become part of the experiential system and to become reflexive for people. So, ah, getting people to act, believe, and feel positive emotions on a daily basis is an important part of all the therapy that we're doing. 

00:56:50
FUTURE 

00:56:55
CHRISTINE A. PADESKY I wanna end, ah, my key note, ah, just hear my invited address just by saying that, uhm, when I think about the future of Strengths-Based CBT, ah, I smile because I think the future is really bright. Bucksmint-- Buckminster Fuller once wrote that, ah, ideas that were somewhat novel often take about 20 years before they start to feel comfortable and mainstream to people and actually gather interest. So, it's not uncommon for ideas to develop over a 20-year period without people really being very aware of it and then all of sudden people hear it and say, "Of course," and get quite excited about it. I think we're at that point right now on the cusp of that with Strengths-Based CBT and I certainly feel, ah, the interest and excitement and support from people I have been talking to here at the Evolution Conference. So I think our future is very bright and I look forward to coming back to the next conference and telling you what we've found out because we're beginning to do research on some of these ideas and we're also continuing to develop the clinical models and right, right treatment manels-- manuals to explain exactly what we're doing. So, thank you very much for your interest. Thank you.
