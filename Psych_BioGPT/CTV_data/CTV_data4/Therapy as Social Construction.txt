"Therapy as Social Construction" with Sheila McNamee Ph.D. and Julie Tilsen Ph.D. 

00:00:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE Hi, I'm Sheila McNamee. 

00:00:00
JULIE TILSEN Hi, I'm Julie Tilsen. 

00:00:45

00:00:45
Constructionist theory [kuhn-struhk-shuh-nist] Locates the source of meaning, value and action in the relational connection among people 

00:00:50
JULIE TILSEN Um, Sheila, I'm wondering if we could start by, um, saying what social construction is. 

00:01:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE Sure, good start. I like to think about social construction as a way we orient ourselves to the world and to each other. Sometimes I use the term, the description of a philosophical stance. It's not, what I'm trying to say is it's not a model, not a theory, okay? But it's a way to orient ourselves to the world. So, that way of orienting ourselves to the world is distinguishable from the taken for granted, dominant, and traditional way of talking and being in the world that is called many things, but let's just call it individualism. Where the presumption is that we are self-contained individuals, and everything that makes us who we are is, is inside this container of the body. So our personality, our characteristics, our traits, our emotions, everything that makes us who we are, is inside of us. That's the dominant way that we operate in the world, so that when you speak or act, it is about you, it is coming from you. 

00:02:10
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

00:02:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE And, there, I mean, we could talk a lot about individualism, that's not our point here, but, but the by-product of that is that I can hold you responsible for all your actions and you alone, um, I can, uh, pathologize you, I can diagnose you, I, you know, my whole focus is on the person and what the person can or can not do. Social construction, in contrast, embraces a relational orientation, and looks, not at an individual person, but at what people do together, so what happens when we are in interaction, not only with each other, but with our environment, so it's not just about people, but it's about the processes of relating to one another and in those processes of relating, creating a world. 

00:03:05
[sil.] 

00:03:05
Postmodern Therapy [pohst-mod-ern] Human thought and behavior exist in cultural contexts that give them particular meaning and significance 

00:03:15
JULIE TILSEN Um, you know, one of the things I'm also wondering about, either the difference between or the connection between social construction and postmodernism. 

00:03:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE Overall, what I would say is, um, postmodernism is kind of an overarching term for a number of different ways of talking that have overlapping features, and yet some distinctions, and social construction would be one of those. So, you know, we could talk about postmodernism and social construction as, as, sort of, vary-, variations on a theme, or we could say postmodernism is the overarching and social construction is one within. 

00:04:00
Social Construction and Therapeutic Practice 

00:04:00
JULIE TILSEN What I'm wondering is, when you describe it as a philosophy, and then you talk about where it does and doesn't connect with postmodernism, that sounds really big. 

00:04:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. 

00:04:10
JULIE TILSEN So I'm wondering, if we start paring it down and, uh, focus on practice- 

00:04:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mm-hmm. 

00:04:10
JULIE TILSEN You know, conceptualizing practice, and then the doing of practice, um, what are some ways to start paring that down so that we're now- we're going to start talking about therapy? 

00:04:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE Really, we're talking about ways of looking at how people interact and how to make sense of the social world. 

00:04:30
JULIE TILSEN (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:04:30
SHEILA MCNAMEE So we pick the therapy context as one illustration, just one place. 

00:04:30
JULIE TILSEN (crosstalk) Yep, okay. 

00:04:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE In practice the focus is, is again on what people are doing together. It's not on the individual, so particularly in, in therapy we have a history of therapeutic practice that is on- all focused on correcting the wrong, or the ill, individual. 

00:04:55
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. 

00:04:55
Therapy as Social Construction 

00:04:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE And, what, even if we're speaking only with an individual in therapy, but we're using a constructionist stance, we're more interested in understanding the networks of relationships and the communities within which that person operates. Where certain ways of acting, certain ways of making sense, uh, certain beliefs, certain values, are given birth. Where they're honored and created, and therefore give legitimacy to the way someone acts. But when that person maybe moves away from that particular relational community and enters into another one, those ways of acting, making sense, those values, those beliefs are not coherent anymore. So, we're trying to, you know, explore instead of saying wow, you know, you don't know how to move from one context to another and there's something wrong with you. It's more trying to look at the networks of relations where certain forms of understanding have emerged. This shift with therapy as social construction is an emphasis on language practices, okay? Or what I refer to as what people do together, okay? I'm not just talking about words, I'm not just talking about written text, you know, I'm talking about all embodied activities. To the constructionist there, there is no particular method technique. There are resources for action. And they're plentiful resources. We all have multiple resources. So, going back to the very opening question you asked me about, you know, "What is social construction?" 

00:06:35
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:06:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE We could say, for example, that individualism, as a way of being in the world is simply that. It's a way of being in the world. It's not a truth. A relational way of being is another way of being. It's also not a truth. So there is no, we can't say "We have a constructionist therapy, and this is what you do, and here is the technique." But rather that we take a relational approach that says "When we're engaged with another, we will be responsive using whatever resources seem to be, in fact, responsive to that person." 

00:07:15
JULIE TILSEN Uh, you know, I'm wondering if there's a way in which you could use what we're doing right now, how we are being together and talking together right now as the way to, um, um, as an example... 

00:07:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE You just asked me a question. 

00:07:30
JULIE TILSEN Yes I did. 

00:07:30
SHEILA MCNAMEE And, um, if I had, uh, stood up and walked away after you asked that question, we would be in a very different moment. The meaning of what we were doing would be different. 

00:07:45
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

00:07:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Now, who knows what it would be? Maybe the, you'd say "What's wrong with her?" or "Did I insult her?", and maybe, you know, people would say "They must be having an argument." that "She doesn't want to answer the question." or, um, or maybe something extran-, some kind of meaning would be made, right? I didn't. You asked a question, I'm answering your question. 

00:08:10
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. 

00:08:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE And, so, your question takes on the meaning of a legitimate, viable question, a particular kind of question to me, at the moment that I respond. Your question alone has no meaning. 

00:08:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:08:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE It's in the, the response, it's, it's in what we do in the to and fro between us. 

00:08:30
JULIE TILSEN The question doesn't have any meaning outside of whatever context it's in? 

00:08:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. 

00:08:40
JULIE TILSEN But I think I'm also hearing you say "The question doesn't have any meaning until something after it happens." 

00:08:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE That's right. The context is very important. The history of our relationship. 

00:08:45
JULIE TILSEN That's right. 

00:08:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE The culture within which we're set. So it's not, you know, we make meaning up brand new at every moment everything is new, because we are born into, and we live within, traditions and cultures and sets of expectations around all of those things, and we learn certain forms of behavior, certain patterns of action that, you know, um, I I love to tell a story of my son when he was quite small, we were riding bikes, we were going down a hill, and, and he said "I'm so sad!" you know, he just blurted it out and we stopped, and we said "What's wrong?" and he repeated "I'm so sad!" with all the right facial expressions, and we said "What's wrong?" and he said "I have tears!" okay? So for him, he had learned the sort of cultural, you know, local interpretation that when you have tears, you're sad. 

00:09:40
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. 

00:09:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE That's what we had taught him. But he, he had tears because the wind was in his eyes. 

00:09:45
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. 

00:09:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE So, it's that kind of, there's this, we learn how to name things in relation with others in the traditions and with people, um, and we learn what goes with what, you know, how to respond to a greeting. 

00:10:00
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. 

00:10:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE How to respond to a question, you know, we learn certain kinds of ritualistic patterns in our culture. And so the, the difference that makes it relational is that we need each other to make meaning. 

00:10:10
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

00:10:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE If I were taking an individualist point of view, I might be sitting here saying "Wow, Julie's asked a question and I don't think I can give an answer to that." You know, it would be all about what I can do and what you can do. 

00:10:25
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. 

00:10:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE As opposed to what we're making together. 

00:10:30
[sil.] 

00:10:30
The Consultation: Preparation and Intention 

00:10:30
Eric, 14 years old, was born male. He reports feeling "trapped in a male body" and identifies as female. Eric has been diagnosed with Asperger's and is bullied at school. 

00:10:30
Eric has been hospitalized for suicide ideation several times. He has a loving supportive family. He is in counseling for identity issues and "worry". 

00:10:30
The therapist seeks consultation as he reports being "stuck" and unable to make progress. 

00:11:05
JULIE TILSEN Sheila, I'm wondering if we could talk some about a consultation you did with, um, Jeff, the therapist who brought, a clients situation to you, um, he's dealing with a young person and their family, that he said he was feeling stuck with, uh, you met with Jeff, and also utilized three other therapists, uh, positioned as a reflecting team, in the consultation. Um, I think it would be, perhaps, hopefully, really helpful to kind of talk, sort of like the behind the scenes, whats going on, what were you thinking about, um, before you met with Jeff for the supervisory consultation, maybe how you think about and talk with the people and the reflecting team, then think about using them so that, how they're positioned, um, you know, what you do with this idea for yourself, uh, and for preparing versus planning. 

00:12:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE I prepared myself for that conversation, thinking of very simple things. Uh, I wanted to listen carefully for the ways in which I might hear that he was privileging some voices over others. 

00:12:30
JULIE TILSEN Voices meaning (crosstalk) such as... 

00:12:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE In this case it could mean anything. But in this case, um, was he privileging the clients voice, 

00:12:40
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

00:12:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE The client's mothers voice, the voice of the psychiatrist who also has diagnosed the client in a particular way. Now I didn't know that these were, I didn't know who we were dealing with. 

00:12:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, you fill in the blanks as you hear them. Yeah. 

00:13:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE I had to fill in the blanks (crosstalk inaudible ) voices, but I wanted to be, to, to try to listen carefully to his story, and, without being judgmental, and frankly, I don't know, it's very hard when you're listening to someone, to not take the, what I'd call the advisory role. "Did you try this?" "What about that?" You know. It's very hard to just listen and then ask a question, but also have the question not be, you know, a suggested, like "Did you try that?" 

00:13:35
JULIE TILSEN Right, right. 

00:13:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE Or "Why didn't you?" 

00:13:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:13:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE Um, so, that was one of the things I'd prepared myself, I wanted to I was hoping that in our conversation I could expand the voices so that he might hear all of those people I just mentioned, and others, anyone involved in the case, and even himself as having maybe another, a whole 'nother way of talking about the situation. 

00:13:55
JULIE TILSEN (crosstalk) Okay. Right, right. Okay. So expanding voices is, is a way to increase possibilities, perspectives, options, not get pigeonholed or,or get okay, blinders on. 

00:14:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE (crosstalk) Right 

00:14:10
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

00:14:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE Because I know, if we, if meaning is constructed in interaction it always could be constructed differently. 

00:14:15
JULIE TILSEN Right 

00:14:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE And so that's the point, like how could we construct this, not so, not to get to the right instruction, but to get to the useful one. And that's actually an important feature of social construction is that replacing voracity, truth, with utility. 

00:14:30
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. 

00:14:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE What's going to help this person move on. 

00:14:35
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:14:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE And move on in a generative way. A way that doesn't harm others, harm himself, etc. etc. 

00:14:40
JULIE TILSEN Right, right, okay. 

00:14:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE Okay. So I was, that was one way I prepared myself, and another way I prepared myself was to not worry, you know, about being too relational in the sense of, as if there was a technique. 

00:14:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. 

00:14:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE You know, so I wanted to kind of mix up my ability to use any idea I have about human beings, about psychotherapy, you know, I wanted, if, if something came to mind that might sound a little more, uh, behavioral or cognitive, I wanted to be able to ask those questions too. 

00:15:20
JULIE TILSEN (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:15:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE I think it would be part of the conversation. I'm not sure if I did ask any of those questions. 

00:15:25
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:15:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE But, um... 

00:15:25
JULIE TILSEN So, sort of like, um, there, like you were talking about borrowing from one place to bring it to the other. 

00:15:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE Exactly. 

00:15:35
JULIE TILSEN Using the familiar and the unfamiliar. 

00:15:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE That's right. 

00:15:35
JULIE TILSEN Uh, mixing up the contexts. 

00:15:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE And also, one of the ways I often use the familiar and the unfamiliar is to think about, you know, while som-, while I'm listening to someone is to be taking that story in as if I were the client as if I, in another moment, I might shift in my inner dialog to this if I am Jeff, you know, the therapist? 

00:16:00
JULIE TILSEN (crosstalk) Okay. Yeah. So, okay. What would this be like for the client. 

00:16:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. 

00:16:05
JULIE TILSEN What would this be like for Jeff. What would this be like for a parent. 

00:16:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE Right. 

00:16:10
JULIE TILSEN Okay, got it. 

00:16:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE But, of course, that's, I'm bringing all of my stories to that. 

00:16:15
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. 

00:16:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE So it's not going to be the way the mother, the way Jeff, the way the client, is. It, it, and that's the generative aspect. 

00:16:20
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:16:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE That I can say "What if?", or if I think of myself as the mother, this is something I might be thinking about, or worried about, or something I might do. And it doesn't matter that whether there is what she would do or not, but hopefully, my hope is it would open some space up for Jeff to start seeing the characters in this scenario as multi-faceted, rather than more singular beings. 

00:16:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. Also it sounds like resources someone might hold some, ah, some possibility, some perspective, something that unhinges his "stuck"-ness that he talked about. Okay so that, that's part of your, um, your, your preparation and positioning? Yeah. Any other things that go into that, or things that you carry with you? 

00:17:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE I, I call them flexible and fluid resources, and it's, you know, they shift and change over time, but basically, you know, I try to always avoid speaking from abstract positions, you know, about what's good, what's bad, what's right, what's wrong, and try to really invite people and myself to speak from a story, from a, uh, an interactivemoment that has resonated. 

00:17:35
JULIE TILSEN (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:17:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE That has resonance here. 

00:17:40
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. 

00:17:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE Um, I find that that's, when we do that, we're entering into a process of creating some meaning together, as opposed to when we enter from an abstract position, we enter right in to judgment and evaluation. 

00:17:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. You know, so that this, what we're doing, in talking about this, doesn't become too abstract, are, is there something particular from the consultation that might serve as an example? 

00:18:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE The one, there are several moments that come to mind. 

00:18:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. 

00:18:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE But one is about the moment about the Gucci bag, right? 

00:18:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, the Gucci bag. 

00:18:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE And, like, I really, you know, just seems, like that was a throwaway line. You know, that, um, it was a struggle, you know, for, for the client, because she wanted this Gucci bag, and it was really important, but, as I recall, the mother just thought that was too much, and so wouldn't get it for her. But that was like, almost like a side, little side story, more about the dynamic, you know, going on, but the real stuff was about the Asperger's. 

00:18:40
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. "Real Stuff". 

00:18:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE The "Real Stuff". 

00:18:45
JULIE TILSEN That Jeff, or mom, or adults were organizing around, okay. 

00:18:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yes. Around the Asperger's, primarily for the mom, and so forth. 

00:18:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:18:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE But, for Jeff it was also about the taunting and so forth, somewhere in the identity transition, 

00:18:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:18:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE You know, kind of got lost. 

00:19:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:19:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE So, I started wondering about the Gucci bag story being a, a, if I could create a story around that, could that in some way bring back this identity transition thing. 

00:19:10
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. 

00:19:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE Because, you know, it is about, it's an icon of a certain kind of identity. You know, a very feminine identity. 

00:19:20
JULIE TILSEN A feminine identity. Right. Yeah. 

00:19:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE So I was interested in asking, you know, sort of, like, more about that, opening up the space for that story to come back in, rather than just sort of being, well, that wasn't really, that, that's just and illustration of how mother and client, you know, don't, don't get along. Where they have some friction. 

00:19:45
JULIE TILSEN Right. Right, okay. 

00:19:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Um, I'd say another moment was around the labeling of Asperger's, and, instead of just saying, "Yeah. Okay" and accept this kid has Asperger's, um, to more wonder about the story of how that story of Asperger's is so helpful, it's recruited to save this whole family, basically. Maybe not Eric, but save the family from having to deal with the identity transition issue. 

00:20:20
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:20:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE You know, it really seemed to be what was going on. And that also, that theme was, both of those themes were picked up, I think really nicely, by the reflectors. 

00:20:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:20:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. 

00:20:35
JULIE TILSEN So, in terms of the reflectors, um, can you talk a little bit about purpose or intention behind having reflectors? Um, how you think about them, how you helped prep them? 

00:20:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE I, um, I didn't say a lot to them. 

00:20:50
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. 

00:20:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE I said a really, I would really just like you to listen and, um, if you could just think about the ways in which, you know, you could open up and give, you know, more voice, multiple-, multiple voices, to what has become perhaps singular, I mean , I was just assuming there would be kind of a sort of singular narrative that had been created. 

00:21:15
JULIE TILSEN (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:21:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE And that's why Jeff would be stuck. 

00:21:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. Stuck kind of a broad, yep, yep, mm-hmm. 

00:21:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE That was my presumption I had at the time, and so, you know, just kind of listen differently. Listen as if there were other stories to be told here. 

00:21:30
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

00:21:30
SHEILA MCNAMEE And so, um, I, I think they did that and, and, also, just in terms of having reflectors. 

00:21:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:21:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE I find that so useful, because a lot of things that I, if me in my interviewing position, if I had said them, they could have sounded evaluative. If I had asked a question about how Asperger's is kind of co-opting other issues, Jeff may have felt that I was evaluating, you know, why, why are you letting this story happen? And I, and reflectors can, can, uh, in this very thoughtful way just suggest that there might be some issues, some questions. 

00:22:20
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. Yeah, they're a step removed, he's not having to respond to them, because there's the conversational space, the listening space, created by the structure, um, okay. So those are some of the intentions and reasoning behind it. 

00:22:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE Right, and also, you know, again if, if one of the ideas to open up a space so that a new story can be, new meaning can be crafted so that people can go on in a way that is generative. 

00:22:50
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:22:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE Having multiple voi-, other voices enter in to this process can be really useful. It's a luxury, can't have that all the time. 

00:23:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:23:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE Of course, you can do it alone by saying "I'm going to reflect as if I'm going to use another voice now." 

00:23:05
JULIE TILSEN So, after the reflector, the reflecting team had offered, um, you know, would have been evoked for them, what are you thinking, and what are you trying to do with the material they've generated? And what are you trying to do, you know, in support of Jeff? 

00:23:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. 

00:23:25
JULIE TILSEN In consultation. 

00:23:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. Well at first, my, my interest was in, in hearing how he, what he resonated with. 

00:23:30
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. 

00:23:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE Or what he disagreed with. Um, he didn't, I didn't invite explicitly disagreement. 

00:23:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:23:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE I just asked him what he thought, and what he wanted to respond to. And, um, and so I paid close attention to the things that really seemed to resonate with him. Tried to. 

00:23:50
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. 

00:23:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE And um, and then I, I re-, I remember being very careful, I wanted to share with him what has resonated with me. 

00:24:00
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:24:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE Without dominating the resonance for him. So it's, uh, I wanted to be more conversational, more supportive of what had resonated with him, so I chose the things that had resonated with him, and that also resonated with me to talk a little bit further about. 

00:24:20
JULIE TILSEN You know, you talk about that, I have this image of a circle, and it starts kind of small, and it was, Jeff came in, talking about his feeling stuck, and then there was you and so maybe the circle got a touch bigger, and then the reflecting team, and then everything they did, and what you said, in terms of what resonated with him. Do you want to say what resonated with you without it collapsing in on him, and so a way of counseling, negotiating, um, making this wider and bigger, but still connected, but not something over the other, unless that's negotiated too. 

00:25:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE Right. 

00:25:00
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

00:25:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE And I imagined him, you know, as I imagined him moving into the future now with this. 

00:25:05
JULIE TILSEN Hmm. 

00:25:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE I don't imagine him taking all the things that resonated with him and sitting down with Eric and...(crosstalk inaudible ) 

00:25:12
JULIE TILSEN Going down a list or something? 

00:25:12
SHEILA MCNAMEE But rather, you know, what my fantasy and my hope for him and this family would be is to sit in the next session, check in with them, see what's happening, and as pieces, tidbits from our conversations during that consultation kind of resonate with what's happening in the conversation that he's presently in, that he can then, that he finds his own way to bring them in. 

00:25:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:25:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE And maybe some of the things will never be part of their conversation, maybe some things will be and won't help at all, you know, we don't know at all. But, that, now he, I always imagine that every conversation that we have with others offers us resources for action. So I'm in conversation with you, and let's say I, in fact, as I do, really admire the way you ask questions. So then, I can carry that, and I can, like, act as if I'm Julie. 

00:26:15
JULIE TILSEN (chuckles) 

00:26:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE In this conversation. And, uh, so we just keep multiplying and filling this bag of resources that we carry with us. 

00:26:25
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:26:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE And the biggest skill, I think, for a therapist, or anybody, is to remember that you have this huge bag of resources. 

00:26:35
JULIE TILSEN Hmm. 

00:26:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE And that you can use something from another context, from another relationship, here, and thats the challenge for us to be constantly engaging in this reflexive inquiry. 

00:26:50
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. 

00:26:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE How else could I act here? What else could I do? 

00:26:55
JULIE TILSEN (crosstalk)Who else could I invoke? Yeah, okay. 

00:26:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE Who else could I, yeah. And I, I, I mean I just tell a little personal story to put a fine point on that. 

00:27:00
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. 

00:27:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE When I was in graduate school, there was another graduate student who was like, just so competent, she was so gutsy, you know? She just could get up in front of a group, she just, wherever she did, from a party to a class, to a serious conversation, to a silly one, well, she just was, like, competent. And she used to always invite me to do things with her, and I was so intimidated 'cause she was just so in command. And then I remember after quite a while, I remember being in a context in a situation with some other people and I thought, "I'm going to act as if I'm her." 

00:27:40
JULIE TILSEN (chuckles) 

00:27:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE And I did. 

00:27:40
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. 

00:27:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE I mean, in my version. And it was like a breeze, you know? 

00:27:45
JULIE TILSEN Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:27:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE The relationship, the interaction went really well, and it's that sort of thing that, you know, we can, it's not going to, I'm not her. But if, if that's a resource for action that I see as generative and useful, and I can use it, 

00:28:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:28:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE I guess we'll see what happens. 

00:28:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:28:05
The Consultation: Expanding Voices 

00:28:10
[sil.] 

00:28:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE The point of this is to try to explore ways of, multiple ways of remaining in that relational space, and opening up, uh, multiple voices and alternative ways of, uh, thinking about the case that Jeff has brought. So, um, okay? All set. 

00:28:40
JEFF So, if I have to talk louder too, just let me know, but, this client that I have been struggling with, and just for confidentiality I'm going to change his name to Eric, he's about 14 to 15 years old, he was born biologically male, but really feels that he's trapped in a male's body and is female. Um, he started to go through, um... it's hormone replacement to stop puberty at this point, or at least to slow it down. Um, he's been, from now on I'm going to call him she instead of he, all right? Eric, she. She's been starting to wear more feminine clothes to school, but this has caused a lot of problems, in the high school, from bullying. She's also been diagnosed with Asperger's, and it shows up in her social relationships with people such as making inappropriate comments sometimes or trying very hard to be friends with somebody when they don't want to be even engaged in that discussion. And so, um, Eric has also been in and out of the hospital for suicidal ideation, but it has been since at least December since the last time. Um, she does have a lot of family support, her mom shows up to every single meeting, and this just really [?? 00:30:08] within the family, but the family has been struggling too, because, because of the suicidal ideation, and she goes through it a lot, to the point where the family goes in to like crying wolf kinda, um, so. Um, she gets stuck on ideas and purposes or wants as just very repetitious, like, I want a Gucci bag. And that's it. Like we can't even, we could have the whole session talking about the Gucci bag, and I can not seem to get anywhere else except the Gucci bag. A lot of times, besides that, it will be dedicated to this sadness that's in her life. And, it seems like it's more identity than it is a thing that's going on, and so I've been working with, like, changing the linguistic description of it from the sadness more to like the worry, because it seems like a step down. 

00:31:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mm-hmm. 

00:31:15
JEFF Because, and she agrees to it. It was her words to come up with the worry of it, because it's more like the worry of being teased and, and what not at school, but now, like, now the worry has become, like, this very strong identity. And so, what my struggle has been, and why I'm bringing this is that I can not seem to engage with her in any kind of future talk or movement. I'm wanting to either move out of this identity when it really does seem to be disrupting a lot of her relationships with her, with her family, with the school, being stuck in this identity of sadness, or the worry. 

00:31:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE Okay. 

00:32:00
JEFF I just...you know. Stuck. 

00:32:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE One of the first things that, uh, comes to mind as I was listening to you tell that story is, um, you know, uh, if she wants to talk about the Gucci bag she wants to buy or, or what have you, so, I started wondering, I wonder how much of the time you spend with her is spent talking about those sorts of things, and not about the worry, the identity issues, and so forth. 

00:32:30
JEFF Um, actually, many times I can get us out of that, and start talking about the worry. 

00:32:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. 

00:32:40
JEFF And the effects of it. 

00:32:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE Uh-huh. Do you think she wants to talk about the worry? I mean, you already said she avoids it, so I know that, but, I mean, what do you think that she's coming, what do you think she's looking for in her conversations with you? 

00:32:55
JEFF What I think that she's doing is looking for an ally, because she doesn't want to go to school. And, if I agree as a therapist that she shouldn't go to school, then she has this strong ally, but I already know within the family structure it's not, it's not an option. And so, I'm feeling like I'm operating on those kinds of boundaries, that like, I don't, I don't see why she couldn't do online school, cause there's a lot of people who do that, but it's not, the family's not okay with that. 

00:33:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mm-hmm. 

00:33:25
JEFF And so, I think that when we get in to talking about it, she'll go really far in to talking about the worries, the sadness. But it's almost to try to get me to say "That's right, this is so bad that we-, you know, I don't want you going to school." 

00:33:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah 

00:33:45
JEFF Because she did have one therapist who did do that, and... 

00:33:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Uh-huh. Have you talked, I mean it seems like, uh, there's, that's not an option, to do home schooling, but why? How is that such an unquestionable, taken-for-granted truth? 

00:34:00
JEFF Good question. I think what it is, is that as her mom has brought up that it's because of her Asperger's that she wants to see her have these, more social interactions, and she worries that she won't have good social interactions if she's at home. 

00:34:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE So, if, um, if you were to ask Eric of the social interactions that she has at school, how many of them are delightful, positive ones, and how many are the taunting, the teasing, the really worrisome relations? What would she say? 

00:34:45
JEFF She would say that it's mostly taunting. 

00:34:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mm-hmm. But, I mean, do you see, do you feel a disconnect if her mother wants her in school because of, she needs social relations, but the social relations seem difficult for her. How do you think the mother would respond to that, I mean... 

00:35:05
[sil.] 

00:35:10
JEFF I think that the thing is that they tried it last year, and she stayed home for about three or four months because another psychologist had said it was okay to do this, and I think that the family at that point still struggled, because the sadness didn't completely go away. 

00:35:30
SHEILA MCNAMEE So that was, that's not a, it's not a cure, so to speak, or it doesn't, ah, resolve the problem. Hmm. When you talk to Eric, about all of these transitions and changes that she's going through, um, have you has she ever talked about what supports she would find useful for herself, I mean, besides being home schooled? 

00:36:00
JEFF Um, I've, it's been a part of my struggle, like, I've tried to ask some of the questions, and, like, I don't know, it seems to be a roadblock, at least I'm not sure what questions to be asking in it, because she doesn't really talk about much outside of it, so then, I've been trying to use, like, oh, there, there was this show called "Drag Race" which was RuPaul's show and the first year's winner is from Minnesota, and so I was trying to have Eric write a letter to her, and see if she would even come into therapy, but nothing. She wrote the letter, but she didn't want to send it. 

00:36:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Oh, seh never sent it? 

00:36:45
JEFF Yeah. 

00:36:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Hmm. 

00:36:45
JEFF So that was like, far-reaching for me to like, look for support in there, so I'm not really sure how to gain that support. 

00:36:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:37:00
[sil.] 

00:37:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE I'm wondering how much conversation you've been able to have about her, her gender switch. Um, does she enjoy talking about that? Um, is it at a point where it's just taken for granted and on to the next phase? I mean, what I'm thinking and kind of struggling with here is this tension between how much the taunting and the difficulties at school keep her in a space of really paying attention to a shift that she feels is a very natural shift for her. And, so, you know, that's, you know, that's abnormal, but for her it's normal, and so she's constantly like, trapped in the difference between what other people are kind of trying to tell her about herself. 

00:38:00
JEFF Good point. In fact, that we have talked about, first about the gender transitions, but she also has another psychologist at the, um, Center for Human Sexuality, and so, we tend to say "Well, okay, we're not talking about that." But, we try not to bring it up. But, what's interesting is that what you just said, I guess I never even really made it, I didn't think of it as a big point, but, which was, she, so last time was in our last therapy session that, because she's been trying to wear feminine clothes to school, and she gets taunted and teased for that, but she also says then when she tries to be male, she taunts herself, in her mind, for not being real. 

00:38:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mm-hmm. 

00:38:55
JEFF And so, I don't know what the implications are for that, but... 

00:39:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um, I'm also, another thing that struck me in your initial story was her desire to talk about things that seem not to matter in terms of all that she's confronting, like wanting to buy things. And, um, I'm wondering if in some way she might be offering those conversations as ways to really engage in an embellishment and an articulation of her, her comfortable identity. And that you become, the conversations with you are a place where she can actually do that. 

00:39:40
JEFF Sure. 

00:39:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. So, um, I remember hearing a story that another therapist told me about, um, it was a completely different issue, it didn't have anything to do with identity, it had to do with a bad relationship between therapist and client, but, um, where eventually the therapist asked the client to be a fashion consultant to her. And, um, I'm wondering if there's some way in which embracing, you know what you think would happen if you embraced the sort of materialistic, uh, conversation as a way to perhaps, get into the conversations that seem to be the ones that you've been asked to have with her, and you feel like you should have. 

00:40:25
JEFF Sure. Yeah. 

00:40:30
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. 

00:40:30
JEFF It wasn't, that wasn't on the radar. Huh. 

00:40:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. Maybe it shouldn't be, but... 

00:40:35
JEFF No, it's actually, I think that that's a really good point to look at. 

00:40:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE (crosstalk) Yeah. Did, does she, she have siblings, it sounds like? 

00:40:45
JEFF Yeah, she has a twin brother, and so she has some struggles because her twin brother is, like, a hockey player and very masculine and all, and, um, although the struggles are not within the family because she's supported, but... 

00:41:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE So she's supported by her brother as well? 

00:41:05
JEFF For the most part. 

00:41:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. 

00:41:05
JEFF There's, I mean, what the family says is the Asperger's kind of speaking, where if her brother brings over friends, then she'll hit on them or something like that, in inappropriate ways and so, but they say that's just the Asperger's, and so there's some struggles but they still support her. 

00:41:30
SHEILA MCNAMEE If the Asperger's wasn't there as a, uh, handy you know, uh, conversation for the family to have, what do you imagine they might use as, you know, a way to kind of understand the behavior? 

00:41:50
JEFF That it's just teenagers? 

00:41:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE Hmm. It's just a developmental stage? 

00:41:55
JEFF Yup. 

00:42:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE Um, how? It sounds like the Asperger's conversation is an important one. That diag-, that label, in some ways, it sounds like it, perhaps, is more important for the family to use, than the gender identity issue? 

00:42:15
JEFF Yep. 

00:42:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE And is that true of the twin brother as well, do you think? 

00:42:20
JEFF Um, I think so. I think so. Yup. 

00:42:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE What about, um, other people? Like what about teachers? What are their- did they come in and support, I'm also curious about the twin brother, if she's taunted at school, does he get some bullying or taunting as well? Because it's his sibling? 

00:42:45
JEFF The family, I think, is very much set up around helping out Eric, and I do think that that's a form of stress, and so her brother goes to another school that has like this sports and, and what not. 

00:43:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE (crosstalk) Oh. Yeah. 

00:43:00
JEFF But, she went to this school because they had the autistic program. 

00:43:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE Okay. 

00:43:05
JEFF And that's, it keeps her in that school because of that. 

00:43:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE Is the entire school autistic children? 

00:43:10
JEFF No, no it's just they have a program. Yeah. 

00:43:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE (crosstalk)They just have a good program. Yeah, okay. 

00:43:15
JEFF Yep. 

00:43:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE And, um, I mean, she, she's made some really bold steps right? You know, wearing more feminine clothes to school and so forth, you know, in the face of not liking to be made fun of and taunted. Um, I imagine you've had conversations with her about her bravery and her boldness? 

00:43:35
JEFF Yeah. 

00:43:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE And how, does she like being identified that way? 

00:43:45
JEFF I don't, I don't get the sense of that. 

00:43:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Hmm. 

00:43:45
JEFF Because, like, I'll try to ask her about what would you do if, if it was somebody else being bullied, what would you say? And she doesn't even seem to want to engage in that actually, I don't know. It's their life. 

00:44:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE And also, I'm wondering, it said before, uh, about the teachers, their relations and what, if you were to, you know, go beyond the family and beyond focus just on Eric, who else has a vested interest, is in some way involved, holds a stake in this whole story? 

00:44:20
JEFF Yeah, she has, um, her autistic teacher, um I've actually went out there for one meeting, although again I think I probably asked the wrong questions 'cause I didn't really walk away with much more than when I went in, but, she seems to be really dedicated to helping out, and she's, we talk a lot, but just, uh, yeah, um, she's, I don't know what to say, I mean, she seems to be one support I guess. 

00:44:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And are there others? 

00:45:00
JEFF She gets a lot of, like, help from the PCs and stuff like that, and again, this is like the family kind of works around the, around these PCs because they're like saying "Well Summer is coming up, you've got to get these hours in, you've got to use this up, and," you know, "here's some help to do these things." 

00:45:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE Uh-huh. 

00:45:20
JEFF And, a part of it too is it seems like she wants some space. But, because the family is helping so much with this... 

00:45:30
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. 

00:45:35
JEFF Okay, light bulbs are starting to go off with this, but...(laughs) So, the, the family wants to help so much with the getting through this, this, these struggles, that I think they are probably over-helping? And I think, really, what she wants to do is like, come home from school and be done with the day. 

00:45:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:46:00
JEFF But, I mean, she's set up with, like, four or five days worth of PCA's, therapists, and everything else, and so... 

00:46:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE So, uh, in some ways, it, uh, a conversation that might be useful that you could have is, you know, how she may be able to convey to her family that she wants to kind of navigate these waters herself, and maybe to back off. So, you know, and then I'm wondering how much of this, the family coming in has to, you know, the Asperger's becomes the focal point for bringing in lots of help which then, from their point of view also, can help with the, avoid the other issues. 

00:46:40
JEFF Yup. 

00:46:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE So, they're all the more invested in that. 

00:46:40
JEFF Yep. 

00:46:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Um, so how exactly do you feel, you know, stuck and trapped in this? You just, I mean, I think you said in the beginning, but if you could reiterate now? 

00:46:55
JEFF Yeah, uh, I, I feel trapped because it, uh, I think it's maybe, the, the lingo of mental health professions but we need a goal to get to. 

00:47:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE Hmm. 

00:47:05
JEFF Some kind of place that we're trying to reach, and, I can't seem to engage in that conversation with Eric. It's, even when I finally do find something like she talked about liking helping other people, like, if I would start talking about that, more and more, trying to make that bigger in the nuerotherapy realm, she'd be like "Really? Do we have to keep talking about that? 'Cause I don't really care about that." So, and then I'm like, "Oh." So, like the future-oriented sentences is something I've been struggling with. 

00:47:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mm-hmm. 

00:47:40
JEFF To go to something. 

00:47:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mm-hmm. 

00:47:45
JEFF And when would we know that things are better. 

00:47:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:47:45
JEFF And so... 

00:47:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mm-hmm. Um, I mean, it sounds challenging, and, um, it sounds like, uh, it could be useful to, um, engage in a question about mind reading. Like, if I could read your mind what do you think I would learn about what, what you'd like to get out of this besides the, you know, therapist approval to not go to school. 

00:48:15
JEFF Sure. 

00:48:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE Um, and perhaps to engage in that would, because it's almost like, um, you, you pick up on these threads and those are kind of minor, right? 

00:48:25
JEFF Yup, yeah. 

00:48:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE Um, and, and, you've tried to have future, future-oriented, like if things were ideal, ask those sorts of questions? 

00:48:40
JEFF Yeah. 

00:48:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. 

00:48:40
JEFF I try and then she'll, she'll engage for a bit, and then be done with it. 

00:48:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. Yeah. And how long have you been seeing her? 

00:48:50
JEFF Eight months. 

00:48:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE Eight months? 

00:48:50
JEFF Yeah. 

00:48:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE Have you talked to her at all about the summer, what she does in the summer, or is she kind of structured because of the Asperger's? 

00:49:00
JEFF Um, there is a camp that she'll be going to up north, it's a GLBT youth camp, and that's a good thing, but otherwise it will be less structured, and I know she's, she's looking forward to that, being in school, and so... 

00:49:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, let's um, shall we, uh, see what the reflectors have to reflect on? 

00:49:25
KIM Definitely. 

00:49:30
KIM I had a really strong response to the, I guess I wrote down that she's trapped by goals? I had a really strong response to that, and I'm not really sure where that came from, but I think that came from just the whole kind of flavor of, that goals are supposed to have help, but they're kind of feeling like they're trapped. 

00:49:50
UNKNOWN Right. And that's something that we're supposed to do as the professionals, and it can be required, you know, we have to have goals that we're moving someone toward and if they're not moving towards it, then obviously we're not doing our job, and they're not getting better, and things aren't happening, and, and so it can be very trapping. 

00:50:15
KIM Yeah. 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN That, you know, stuff can create it's own sense of stuckness when you feel like you're not doing the right thing like having goals and moving someone. 

00:50:25
KIM Yeah. 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, you know, I was thinking, one of the things that resonated when that was happening and as you were even speaking now was, um, the image of her taunting herself. Um, Jeff taunting himself for not knowing what to do. 

00:50:40
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:50:40
UNKNOWN You know, feeling like somehow he's failing. Um, another image that came to me really strong was crying wolf. 

00:50:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:50:50
KIM Mm-hmm. 

00:50:50
UNKNOWN You know, because wolves are powerful, and they're big and they're beautiful and they belong, and, and the image of the crying wolf being false versus the crying wolf being in pain and trying to be seen, trying to be connected. 

00:51:10
KIM Yeah, and I saw the crying wolf as that the family was crying wolf to Jeff, and I kind of saw that also as, um, that they really care, so they're trying to find help for him because they really care about him so I was kind of trying to find some kind of compassion in that. Um, statement two, about the family caring? 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. I know as I sat and listened to Sheila ask questions and listened to Jeff, you know, respond and reflect, and I thought of myself and plenty of people I feel kind of stuck with right now for maybe some different reasons, but that same feeling of, you know, is it me that's stuck, and why, you know, I was sort of questioning myself, and all this professional self-doubt and you know, If I just could just find the right question, or the right tack, or have I tried this and have I tried that and, and how that just sort of creates this vortex sometimes within a session, you know, and it's, and then it would be easier to blame the person I'm sitting with too, well, you know, it's their stuckness, you know, and why- so I, so I just got caught up in that myself, in just that feeling. 

00:52:20
KIM Right, right and to beat yourself up too, you know, like, oh, if I was just good enough, I would be able to ask the right question. 

00:52:25
UNKNOWN Right, I'm obviously missing something, and I obviouisly don't externalize problems well enough, or I'm not asking the miracle question right enough, or why can't I get this person to be future-oriented. And, yeah. 

00:52:40
KIM And I had, I had thought too at one point, you know, that, that they're stuck together as kind of an interesting problem that they're both kind of feeling stuck together so how could, maybe that would be some place to, um, or maybe it would just be another place to get stuck. (laughs) 

00:53:00
UNKNOWN You know, another thing that occurred to me or image that came to me was related to, um, looking for an ally. And I think that maybe both of them are looking for an ally, and, and maybe, um, in the same sort of way that goals constrict instead of expand possibilities, maybe, you know, I was thinking that allies as opening up possibilities versus, you know, versus it being just not to go to school, maybe the ally each of them, you know, how can they align, how can they become an ally. As in, how can they expand that circle of allies. It's just the imagery that was coming to me you know. I know when I'm, uh, thinking of looking for allies, I, and then it took me back to the wolf, and them needing a pack needing a place. 

00:53:55
KIM Oh, yeah. 

00:53:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. That's, when I was, um, hearing Jeff talk about, um, working with Eric to connect with the RuPaul drag race contestant. 

00:54:05
UNKNOWN Yeah (chuckles). 

00:54:05
UNKNOWN I remember thinking, "Oh, that's brilliant!" And, you know, creating that sense of reaching, you know, talking about going outside of one's box in terms of who can be an ally, and especially since I just saw that show for the first time not long ago (laughs). So there, so and what it, and so I'm thinking of how, you know, how that was for Jeff to, for himself to, to open up to that kind of possibility, um, and for Eric to actually open up to that possibility, and even though she didn't mail the letter, you know, what, what must have that been like for her to write that, to engage with even that possibility of connecting with someone else. And, um, and just that moment and like Kim, is that okay, to have just that moment and be able to talk about that and not see it as somehow, for me as a therapist like it's a failure because she didn't send it, that somehow it didn't work that technique didn't work because it didn't lead to this certain thing, and yet the experience of it itself was just really amazing, that both Jeff and Eric were open to engaging around that. That was super cool. 

00:55:20
KIM The object connecting with the purse. 

00:55:20
UNKNOWN Oh, the Gucci bag! Yeah and when Sheila was asking Jeff about, kind of, those material things, which, I think, for us as adults, um, we tend to discount the things that kids are really into and have some value attached to, and so how do we make it okay, you know, here, here's something that, that Eric is, is really interested in connecting with, but there's some identity around a Gucci bag. 

00:55:45
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:55:45
UNKNOWN For, to be on lots of levels, and what kind of meaning is there for that, and so when Sheila asked Jeff I got this sense of Jeff kind of reacting to that, like "Oh, yeah, okay." But, and I think sometimes as therapists we some permission somewhere, to talk with the kids about meaning around those things that seem shallow, um, when it might have tons of meaning, and for someone like Eric who is going through this transition of trying to understand what being female identified is, and a Gucci bag is, you know. 

00:56:20
UNKNOWN Exactly. (laughs) 

00:56:25
UNKNOWN Exactly, we all want Gucci bags now. So I really appreciated that their interaction around it too, like she let, asking that question kind of opened up some possibilities for Jeff. 

00:56:35
UNKNOWN You know, I like that imagery of it being okay to want. You know, it doesn't matter if it's the object, the make, opening the space to be able to talk about what you want. 

00:56:45
KIM Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:56:45
UNKNOWN Then, you know, I love that idea of permission to talk about, you know this doesn't seem therapeutic enough, and yet, you know, the theme of, you know, what she wants is so important, does she want to go to school, does she want to stay home, does she want to go through the hormone therapy, you know, where, you know, what I want is, and how is that a, you know, how is that priviliged. 

00:57:15
KIM Yeah. 

00:57:15
UNKNOWN And how do you open a space for that kind of dream and vision? 

00:57:20
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:57:20
UNKNOWN If you're so scheduled, and do have all these schools and all these things that you need to be working at. 

00:57:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:57:25
UNKNOWN Where's the room for that dream? 

00:57:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:57:25
UNKNOWN Or that vision. 

00:57:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:57:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, as a 14 year old. 

00:57:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. Which as a grandfather I hate it, I need my world for my dream, I can't imagine at 14 not having it. 

00:57:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:57:35
KIM Yeah. 

00:57:40
UNKNOWN And so, thinking about the work that Jeff has done, to make some space for that. You know, even within the limits of goal setting and the tensions and some real, you know, real important things, like suicidal ideation and attempts, which she hasn't done since December which is amazing, and so how he's worked to make that space and maybe doesn't feel validated in his own work that he's been doing that, but he's actually been making space for her. 

00:58:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah, I was, and having that creativity. 

00:58:15
KIM Yeah. 

00:58:15
UNKNOWN And his ability to dream. 

00:58:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:58:15
KIM Yeah. 

00:58:15
UNKNOWN About this letter, and who knows, let's see. 

00:58:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE What captured your imagination in that conversation? 

00:58:25
JEFF Um, there was a, I mean, I was taking a lot of notes because there was a lot that, that came up that did capture my imagination. Um, the first part of it was, um, this, this idea of building up identity, and I, I mean, while admitting that I was quick as any other, like, her parents and any other adult, to be like, "A Gucci bag, what's that all about?" or whatever, 'cause for me, growing up and then thinking of identity is, I grew up around a punk rock community, so, okay, so then it was just music that I grabbed on to instead of a Gucci bag, and so that was identity, but it was this thing that wasn't in front of me, and so, that the, crying wolf really made sense, and then the last time I had a conversation with Eric was she, she was in a dance class, and she walked by a mirror and it just, it really touched me, because she walked by a mirror and saw her body and she started crying in front of everybody. And she started telling me about how she felt really ashamed of waking up in the morning feeling, you know, excited, yet being ashamed of that part of her body. That identity really just kind of came out and... I was putting aside the Gucci bag stuff, even though I was trying to, you know, keep it there as in it's something but what, but I really put it away, and so that really resonated with me, to like, bring that back in and to create that, help create that identity around those, and look at that as important in that she's not just talking about it just to, just to annoy adults. 

01:00:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE Right. 

01:00:20
JEFF Kind of thing, it's like... 

01:00:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE Right. 

01:00:20
JEFF There's real reason for it. 

01:00:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE Right. Right. 

01:00:25
JEFF And so, and then that she was, um, looking for, she was looking for an ally in this. And, same here. So that really, really resonated with me, in that, that, that part of therapy is what becomes more, um, privileged maybe? Or, the goal, of therapy? 

01:00:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mm-hmm. 

01:00:50
JEFF But to embrace identity in this as something, um, pretty, um, positive in that. 

01:01:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE And maybe, um, maybe both of your identities. Your identity as a therapist in relation to her. 

01:01:05
JEFF Yep. 

01:01:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE And, and her identity. Yeah. 

01:01:10
JEFF Yeah. 

01:01:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE Or identities, we should say. 

01:01:10
JEFF Identities, yep. Yeah, I mean, and, and I'm going from that to, I mean, if anything a professional identity of being humble to the process. The question that came up to, like what do I like about the relationship is that she's an amazing kid, I mean, she's teaching me all about fashion and (laughs) 

01:01:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE (laughs)And you rejected the Gucci bag? 

01:01:35
JEFF I know! (laughs) And so, yeah. Um, but she's got a lot to offer. And so those, those are some of the major ideas to start building from, and then also to, to keep in mind of like, to keep looking for who else has stakes in this. And, I don't think I explored it enough. 

01:02:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mm-hmm. 

01:02:05
JEFF And so, I think that that's really important too. I guess I still, there's still this struggle though of when the family is, is in the room, and how to be an ally when they're taking a different position, and it's part of my professional identity to hold on to, I guess? 

01:02:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. Do you think, ah, that it would be possible to kind of, you know, apropos of this morning's conversation, to set some boundaries, you know, and just create some rules with the family, and say, um, I'd like you to be present but I'd really like to talk to Eric today, and I want you just to be, to listen, you know, and just be in the listening position, and then we can check it, and, you know, sort of contrive and create some, uh, conversational space that's different, so they're present, but not dominating, or you don't feel, I'm wondering, here's the question, um, I'm wondering if you feel when you do talk to Eric that they are judging or evaluating you, um, and that maybe that makes it harder. 

01:03:15
JEFF I don't know about judgment, and, I mean, they keep saying that I'm doing a great job, but I feel more like, um, (inaudible ) triangulation kind of thing going on, where she's, it's mostly her mother comes in and tries to pull me in on her side, to say "This is wrong, and this is wrong." And so, half the session is about not trying to engage with them so... 

01:03:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE I'm wondering if, um, excuse me, if, um, you were to think of, um, some conversations that you could have in, with the parents, but certainly I'm, I'm thinking more particularly in front of the parents, could be seen as instead of against what they're saying it could be resonating with some unspoken, um, ideas that they already have, unspoken voices. Um, they have articulated that they are fine with this transformation that Eric is going through and they're supportive of that, and so, um, it would be, you know, what could happen if they heard you supporting that Eric needs these, some more accouterments of, uh, what it means to be a 14, 15 year old female? And that that could, you know, you could also engage them in saying, you know, don't you have a voice that also recognizes that? And kind of to expand that out, that I think... 

01:04:45
JEFF For the most part, I can say that her mom is, I mean, her mom helps buy her clothes, but she wants to be, Eric wants to be like, "ultra" feminine and so she wants four, five-inch heels and mom's like "No!" (laughs). 

01:05:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE (laughs) It's a safety issue. 

01:05:05
JEFF Right. Exactly, we do talk about that (laughs). 

01:05:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE One of the things that resonated with me was this idea of, you know, taking an Asperger's holiday, and then I was thinking about, um, her going off to camp this summer, a place where there are people, where hopefully she won't feel the taunting, that she'll feel more in community there and supported and so forth. And it would be interesting to, ah, ask her to sort of think about how much of the time when she's there she's noticing that her Asperger's has fallen away, or is more active, or something like that. That's not really taking a holiday from it, I mean a holiday would be to forget about it, and maybe instead it's a conversation to have when she returns, instead of having her monitor it, but, you know, if you think about, um, this label, that's a handy label, for a lot of this stuff that's going on for her, as being contextual and, you know, as, as the reflectors were saying, you know, being 14 or 15 like being socially awkward, it's the definition of being 14 or 15. So but, but being in a context that's more supportive what's that look like. It could be an interesting exploration. 

01:06:25
JEFF Sure, yeah. 

01:06:30
SHEILA MCNAMEE Um, I was sort of fantasizing about having a conversation with her about, um, what therapy should be like, in her ideal. And you could take it off the table - you can't say like "You just sign the paper so I don't have to go to school." but, you know, what, what kind of conversation would you like to be having in here. 

01:06:50
JEFF Yeah. 

01:06:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE And, um, and then you, you know, you become each other's ally in that, uh, conversation. And together you can build, sort of like, how are we going to go on together, really. What do we, what are we doing here. 

01:07:05
JEFF Yeah. 

01:07:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE Um, and there was one other thing that struck me as the team talked about, and also in our own conversation about the letter, you know, writing, which was really a beautiful invitation to her, but then it sort of seemed to fall flat, because nothing happened, but what if, you know drawing on some of Maggie Penn's ideas, what if, um, what if you asked her to write a letter back from, I don't, I don't know the person but... 

01:07:30
JEFF Phoebe. 

01:07:30
SHEILA MCNAMEE Phoebe? Okay, so she writes a letter using Phoebe's voice back to herself. You know, which then, like, creates some kind, and then she can write a letter back, and they can start this exchange. 

01:07:45
JEFF Yep. 

01:07:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE It, it really, um, shifts and changes, can, potentially, this feeling of being an outsider and, or now she may feel excluded because she never got an answer back. But if she writes a response back and start that, that gives another space for her to maybe articulate the person she is trying to become? 

01:08:10
JEFF Sure.
