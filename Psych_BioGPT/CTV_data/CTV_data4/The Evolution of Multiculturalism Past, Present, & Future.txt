LILIAN COMAS-DIAZ  Thank you. It is an honor to be here today. Some of the gifts of multiculturalism can be captured by the works of Mary Catherine Bateson who in her book, "Composing a Life" said, “Instead of concentration on a transcendent ideal sustained attention to diversity and interdependence may offer a different clarity of vision, one that is sensitive to ecological complexity, to the multiple rather than the singular.” Similarly the challenges of multiculturalism can be expressed by the words of Eva Hoffman who in her book, "Lost in Translation" wrote, “Instead of a central ethos, I have been given the blessings and the terrors of multiplicity.” With this framework let us review the conclusion of the United States President Commission on Race and Racism, its members concluded that, “The greatest challenge facing Americans today is to accept and take pride in defining ourselves as a multiracial democracy.” Multiculturalism in this country entails a search for individual and collective definitions and at the same time, represents a threat to our national character. As we can see here. Okay. Here we have uhm, our beloved Frida Kahlo, who painted herself as a member of a cultural borderline, an, an inhabitant of the cultural borderline and that is living between Mexico and the United States, sometimes in Mexico, sometimes in the United States, sometimes no where. This is one of the challenges and the gifts of multiculturalism that having multiple realities entail. And here, we have a Puerto Rican contemporary artist, Hernando Noche-Ravan(ph), who self portrays uhm, emphasizes, or over emphasizes his African features as a way of reconnecting with his life legacy. Thus, asserting his personal liberation and redefining himself. Art sometimes provides a window to the future. Today, I would like to take a journey, a journey witnessing multiculturalism in the United States, a journey that unfolds the enigma of arrival that is "Finding who we are, what we have been and what we can be." "I want to be someone else without ceasing to be myself," Don Quixote said. Our multicultural journey is similar to Don Quixote's quest. Our struggle against oppression ends in self affirmation and transformation indeed Don Quixote's journey is an apt metaphor for recovery and liberation for the healing search of one's self. The concept of trouble bonds many of us here today, people of color, women, gays and lesbians, physically challenged and aged. It reinforces the need for solidarity. In many ways, we are war, warriors of similar struggles, we are veterans of similar wars, however many people of color face Post Colonization Stress Disorder. I knew I was gonna get you laughing but I'm being serious. Some of you know that I have argued that people of colors' oppression is a form of colonization because as highly visible others, people of color bear the mark of historical subjugation that is, we have been conquered enemies, slaves, political possessions, servants, et cetera. We've seen this perspective; colonization, trauma and terror are intimately connected. Gail Wyatt said that, "Racism is a form of terrorism." Paolo Freire, his liberation motto explains their relationship between traumatic oppression and identity. He stated that "Systemic oppression generates a psychological adaptation to the political realities of domination, in which victims internalize their imposed condition and feel incapable of resistance." Traumatic oppression is concentrated and inhumane, robbing people of their voices, agency and identity. Ignacio Martin-Baro, reminded us that "Psychosocial trauma is not an on, unusual event in the context of war but rather an everyday part of life because terror creates a situation of normal abnormality were one move between somewhat accepting the situation as normal, only to be shocked into this orientation and confusion trigger even by a single event." This business-like usual quality we see in terror contributes to the Post Colonization Stress Disorder. Post co-, Colonization Stress Disorder comprises, obviously, colonization, historical and contemporary effects on individuals, families, groups, communities and societies at large. Post Colonization Stress Disorder differs from PTSD in that in Post Colonization Stress Disorder the traumatic process is protracted, repetitive and socio-culturally mediated. A major difference between PTSD and Post Colonization Stress Disorder is that Post Colonization Stress Disorder does not, does not pathologize the individual and highlights the importance of adaptive reactions in contending with profound social pathology. This brings us to the concept of racial torture. As an instrument of colonization, racial torture is both historical and contemporary. Obviously, I see racism as a form of torture. Think of those times when you or your significant other entered a department store to be followed by the security guard just because of your color or your race. Racial torture is an individual and a collective phenomenon. It is pervasive, institutionalized and insidious trauma, as my friend and esteemed colleague, Maria Root(ph) will say, but torture nonetheless. There are contemporary subtle and not so subtle forms of racial torture. Many of us have directly or vica, vicariously experienced racial microaggressions and racial torture. Frantz Fanon called torture "A means of subordination in which power is maintained by breaking down and destroying the individual's personality, serving to terrorize the population and thus, ending any opposition to the dominant regime." Racial torture destructs, destructs individuals' minds, bodies and voices, and as such, destructs their identity and their sense of self. The collective racial torture and its symbolic meanings resonate through time, where past, present and future converge. My conceptualization of working with multicultural populations involves a political repression paradigm. In the field of trauma, there is actually a controversy about using PTSD to explain the effects of torture. Some experts believe that trauma is trauma, is trauma, la, la, la, while others prefer to use the term "Torture Syndrome" to emphasize its uniqueness. Some experts contend that the ethnocentricy, eth, ethnocentricity of PTSD can overlook strengths and atypical disturbances. I happened to be one of those who believe in the specificity of Torture Syndrome. While using individualistic approaches to psychopathology, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, the diagnosing of it, tends to depoliticize issues such as systemic oppression, institutionalized racism, colonization and racial torture. PTSD fails to explain the colonic and insidious nature of racial torture and hence, devalues the issues of causation, impunity and prevention. In examining the limitations of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Herman proposed an alternative, compressed or complex PTSD, focusing less on individualistic, subjective PTSD symptoms and more on relational issues, dissociation, somatic symptoms and alterations in one's world views in terms of trust, hope and meaning. Similarly, Post-Colonization Stress Disorder is a complex phenomenon. It addresses systemic oppression by recogni, recognizing interacting factors within the colonizing oppression, affecting individual, collective and societal levels. Likewise, Post-Colonization Stress Disorder differs from PTSD in that it changes identity, personality, relational capabilities and world view. Can we have the first table please? Let us briefly review the psychosocial effects of racial torture. Racial torture, torture is the breaking of the minds, bodies, spirits and communities. It involves emotional and psychological depressed, you know the traditional PTSD: depression, shame, anger, but in addition to that, it involves the colonized mentality. It also has cognitive schema changes about the concept of self and others and the world as a just place paradigm, involving issues of trust, power, self-esteem and safety. Somatic and physiological consequences, developmental, in here, it involves the self, that is the identity and the character, and the other, the attachment and relational issues. Behavioral consequences such as learned parner, patterns, acting in and acting out, spiritual consequences involving the questioning of the meaning of life, losing hope, demoralization or alternatively, developing the concet, concept of being the "chosen people." And lastly, the communal consequences and that is the breaking of the collective self, the sense of community, leading to an "us and them" mentality. I have been challenged by conceptualizing a theoretical and applied model of making meaning, of thinking multiculturally about trauma, colonization, voice and identity, a model whereby the situated otherness of both clients and helpers is framed within the practice of a collective struggle and solidarity. A contextual model that extends the individual focus to include family, community and society, both national and international, and shifting to a study of oppression and colonization and their effects on individual social attitudes, values and development. This search has led me to Psychology of Liberation. As some of you may know, Psychology of Liberation attempts to work with people, in context, through strategies that enhance the awareness of oppression and of the ideologies and structures that have kept them subjugated and oppressed. It collaborates with the oppressed in developing critical analysis, or what Paulo Freire called "Conscientization" and engaging in transforming action. The integration of a liberation paradigm with an indigenous psychological perspective frames the culturally situa, situated condition of many people of colors. It offers resources to strengthen our next generation's capability to reconceptualize the effects of oppression and terror, as well as to accompany affected populations in their struggles to reclaim their ethnic and racial roots and reconstruct identities within multiethnic and multiracial societies. Within the liberation framework, "accompany" means "Standing alongside people, working with them, seeking to develop collaborative relations that recognize power inequities within these relationships, as well as within the context in which one is working and seeking to transform them. Psychology of Liberation criticizes dominant psychology for its individualistic focus, a historical perspective, absence of political embeddedness, lack of transformative potential and its refusal, refusal to make moral and ethical choices. Indeed, Ignacio Martin-Baro argued that for psychologists, taking sides is not a bias position rather it is an ethical choice grounded in the truth of reason and compassion. There are at least three major elements in psychology of liberation that differ from dominant psychology. They are; a new horizon focusing on the liberation of the people as well as personal liberation; a new epistemology where the truths of the popular majority is not to be found but rather constructed from below up; and a new practice where we place ourselves within the research action process alongside the dominated rather than alongside the dominator. Psychology of liberation echoes Frantz Fanon's work and is mostly based on the liberation theology and pedagogy of liberation elaborated by Paulo Freire. It also resonates with the work of a number of African American psychologists who drew heavily on the works of Black liberation theology and Africanist traditions in the articulation of the Black psychology. Thomas Gordon for instance compared white and Black psychology raising ethical and political concerns, conceptual limitations and metrological witnesses within white Euro-American psychology. He challenged Black psychology to give priority in considering, among other things, to develop research that proceeds from the real needs, life real needs rather, rather than theoretical imperatives. Thomas Gordon urged the development of collaborative relations with Black or African American communities and suggested that psychologist will need new research competencies and roles including those of advocates, lawyers, information resource people, et cetera in order to facilitate what he called "The Advancement of Black Collective Interest." In order to move from victims of racial torture to survivors we need to reformulate our identities, reaffirming our integrity, rebuilding our capacity for connection with other individuals and re-opening to a life of community and future possibilities. To achieve these we also we also need to conquer our internalized oppress-, oppression. According to Paulo Freire, "The consciousness of the oppressed consists of the authentic being and the inner oppressor." Similar to other survivors of torture, people of color need to learn to reject the feelings of inferiority and weaknesses instilled by our torturers and restore essence of continuity with our identity. Thus, identity and liberation are extremely connected. Allen Ivey has contributed to this dialogue strengthening the connection between identity and liberation. He argued that, "It is important for the oppressed to find their own voice and language in order to name and describe their condition." He then advanced the centrality of the cultural and racial identity development in promoting liberation. Similarly, Janet Helms suggested that the key milestone in ethnic minority's racial identity development is overcoming internalized racism and developing a socio-political understanding of race and oppression. Thus, a complete liberation involves the colonization, addressing the inner oppression. Can we have the second table please? Many of you have seen this table because it had been published in the work that Bep(ph) and I edited and it involves the, ah, therapeutic decolonization process which basically deals with becoming aware of the colonized mentality, correcting cognitive errors that reinforced the colonized mentality that is working through, ah, dichotomous thinking superior, inferior, colonized equals good, colonized or equals bad etcetera, vice versa, acknowledging ambivalence to ourselves and others. Three, developing a more integrated identity by reasserting and reaffirming racial, ethno-cultural, gender, sex orientation, class identity. Increase in self mastery and achieving autonomous dignity and working towards the transformation of self and the colonized condition, not only by improving the condition of people of color but also improving the condition of non-people of color, I think this is a nice challenge of psychology of liberation. How we're gonna with the tortures, how to work with our own pathology. 

00:26:35
DR. LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ  In this process we can help the survivors of post-colonization stress disorder and racial torture to find something to value in the traumatic experience, for instance, lessons learned, new priorities, a new found awareness of their strengths. For instance, for many people of color some of the lessons learned include rebellion is an act of love, I thought you would like that one. Identity is reality, one is all, ethnicity and culture are developmental processes among many others. Liberation psychology is not a panacea(ph), particularly with respect to gender equality. Frantz Fanon argued that revolutionary struggle for national inde, independence will lead to women's liberation and many of us follow the man thinking that after our countries will be liberated, we will be liberated. Hmm, however, maybe that's what I'm here today, uhm, (clears throat). The struggles in Chicago liberating our Puerto Rican community in Chicago. However, Algeria, South Africa and sadly, the contemporary Taliban movement and other historical accounts tell us that women's rights are lost after, "National liberation." As Jessie Jackson stated, "Ignoring great, ignoring race and sex is racist and sexist." Follows. Winning one battle does not mean winning the war. We need to continue our journey, rediscovering our ancient roots as, perhaps, for killers and clergy. This process requires a delicate balance between using mainstream knowledge, rescuing ethnic minority arcane wisdom and creating new knowledge. The fusion of dominant and indigenous inferences can offer another path in our multi-cultural journey. Time for another slide. 

00:29:20
DR. LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ  Okay, this, ah, some of you if you are able to see is another painting by Frida Kahlo where she is giving birth to herself. Uhm, the reason I'm make, I'm putting the slide up is to show you how Frida Kahlo used, uhm, the influences of her indigenous background. This is basically her depiction of the, of the Mexican, ah, goddess Moyo Coyotzin(ph), Moyo Coyotzin(ph), "She who creates herself." And, uhm, undermines the importance of the cultural and ritual practices, how some of our Asian beliefs may help us deal with now and with tomorrow. 

00:30:15

00:30:15
DR. LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ  I commend the organizers of this Summit for their recognition of the female principle. For celebrating and honoring our female pathfinders. For creating a sacred space. For creating a context of sharing with us the notion of sacrament where most ordinary activities and materials become carriers of meaning and of proper actions in a ritualistic manner, having its informative value. By this, I mean, the organizers of this Summit are developing a special sacrament today when they're honoring our female pathfinders. I would like to salute those female pathfinders: Martha Bernal, Reiko Homma True, Carolyn Payton, and Carolyn's (inaudible ) memory, women of color, psychologists who would be honored just after my presentation. In this sacred space let us remember that when we work with victims of political repression we are forced to confront questions of meaning ultimately traveling to the land of spirituality. The same process occurs with post colonization stress disorder. Similar to the Shaman's journey, we encounter chaos and destruction just to emerge stronger and with a more integrated identity. Once more we need to reformulate our identities as healers. Maybe this can be an example. Okay, this is a joke so you're supposed to lie, laugh. Uhm, let me see, and how does that make you feel about your father? (clear throat) 

00:32:35
[sil.] 

00:32:35
DR. LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ  He's kicking the, ah, so-called patient. It's called the "Psychochiropractor." Okay. We need to remen, remember that in our journey, uhm, humor is not only healing it's also a, ah, survival technique. It has been written that for many people of color, uhm, humor is a way to keep our self from killing our self. But humor is also transformation. So let's keep on laughing. Uhm, on that note and on dealing with the new stage of our identities as healers, in this case, psychologist. I have another slide for you. Oops. Okay, this is a, uhm, restaurant. This is the, the Metro Dine(ph), the restaurant, ah, taking a reservation by the phone. I know you cannot read but it says, "Certainly a party of four for five o'clock," something like that. Is this doctor, is that a Ph.D. or an M.D.? 

00:33:55
[sil.] 

00:33:55
DR. LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ  Okay, now I'm bringing this up because we are in the eve of psychologists transforming themselves into prescription privileges. Uhm, and, uhm, maybe this cartoon has something to do with that. I don't know but I'll leave that up to you. Uhm. 

00:34:25
[sil.] 

00:34:25
DR. LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ  Oops, go back. This one is really good. 

00:34:35
[sil.] 

00:34:35
DR. LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ  Huh, and there are two more there, that's it. 

00:34:45
[sil.] 

00:34:45
DR. LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ  I apologize for these technical difficulties. Well, there's more. There's no more? Really? Well, I'm sorry. Uhm, anyway I'm gonna tell you about the slide. It's just this, ah, I can't believe it. The slide, it has several doctors, you know, one westerly trained doctor and the other one, indigenous doctors. And it says, every single doctor prescribes or recommends and the whole concept was for us to remind that, remind ourselves that pharmaceuticals are really into diversity. However, the slide, all of the doctors were males, so you would just, uhm, uhm, uhm, to remind ourselves that we still have to keep looking to all those isms. Uhm, getting on a more serious note, there's another aspect, an important aspect of the medicalization of psychology and, uhm, in a provocative case study, uhm, Frederick Jacobsen reported that a white man dating a woman of color was successfully treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. SSRI, Prozac, okay? Sorry. For his depression and anxiety. The client's patient, ah, obsession about not wanting to marry his significant other because she was not white was significantly reduced. Remember, he didn't come to treatment to be treated for his "ambivalence and intimacy" with his non-white ah, significant other. He came to treatment because he was suffering from depression and anxiety. The couple finally got married. Now, this case, uhm, suggests a controversial model for racism. See(ph) now I'm being serious but it's funny. Sometimes the truth can be very deceiving. Uhm, the controversial model for racism is actually whether racism is a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder. We don't know. And if it's that's the case, can we treat racism psychopharmacologically? 

00:37:25
[sil.] 

00:37:25
DR. LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ  So, we better get those prescription privileges. 

00:37:35
[sil.] 

00:37:35
DR. LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ  Okay, what is the next step in our journey? (clear throat) I'm getting serious now. Those of you who know me don't, you know that sometimes it's hard to know when I'm being serious and when I'm not. Uhm, witnessing a historical crossroad, we are not longer in search of an identity. We are asserting it. Indeed, the very act of self definition is a rejection of coloni, colonization. Our journer(ph), cultural diversity, and ethnic minority psychology is an avenue for liberation and affirmation. It can offer conviviality. Evan Ellis(ph) believe that individual liberation is realized in interpersonal interdependence. I want to close by telling you a true fable. One, you know I love, uhm, paradoxes, one that may point out to our next identity reformulation. This is the story of The Massacre of the Dreamers. This is serious, okay? As being told by this wonderful scholar of color, Anna Castillo. Here, where we stand today, what is used to be Mexico, the Olmec civilization was a highly sophisticated one, one that priced its dreamers. The dreamers were the magicians. They were the visionaries. During the time of Montezuma the dreamers were prophesizing the arrival of the Spaniards and the subsequent annihilation of the empire. Montezuma ordered the murder in mass of the dreamers. He knew that, although they were not responsible for the destruction of the Mexican Empire, he murdered them out of his own despair. Dreamers in Asian civilizations provided vision, knowledge and guidance. When the dreamer, the visionary is murdered, is banished from society the result is the denigration of life and the annihilation of the spirit. Let us not commit Montezuma mistake again. Let us resurrect the dreamers; better yet, let us become the dreamers. Thank you.

UNKNOWN  I think we just have to say, "Go girl." 

00:40:55

00:40:55
UNKNOWN  So, it's my pleasure to present to you, Lillian, the Dalmas A. Taylor Award for a light that indeed shines eternally taking on the challenge of change. Congratulations. 

00:41:30
DR. LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Thank you. 

00:41:30
[sil.] 

00:41:30
DR. LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ  Thank you. Muchas, muchas gracias. What I would like to do is, perhaps, use this time to have the women of color that we're honoring come to the podium and we love to hear from you. Thank you.
