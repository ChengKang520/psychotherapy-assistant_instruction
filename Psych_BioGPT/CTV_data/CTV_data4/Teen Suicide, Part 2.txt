00:00:45
STUART MUSZYNSKI Founder, Project Love Welcome to Principles. 12 times a day, 84 times a week, 4,000 times a year, a youth suicide occurs.

Principles Teen Suicide Part Two 

00:00:55
STUART MUSZYNSKI Teens may your friend threaten to commit suicide. What do they do? What should they do? When is it right to tell? 

00:01:00
PRINCIPLES 

00:01:00
STUART MUSZYNSKI When all too often a suicide is carried out the survivors, friends, family, teachers, counselors, need help to face the devastating consequences. How do we help prevent suicide and how do we help the families if it occurs? Irene Beville is here, our quest panelist and we're joined by national experts Dr. Robert Findling and Rabbi Dan Roberts and by Elaine Seeley, the mother of a teen suicide victim, Nicole Seeley. And we also be joined by teens from Americas high schools. I want to turn to our group over here.

00:01:40
STUART MUSZYNSKI Teens, I think the statistics are that, 20% of all teens have contemplated suicide, 13% have actually carried it out, or attempted to carry it out, ah… we’ve seen the numbers what they are translates into… what can we do? 

00:02:00
Where are you getting those numbers, I’m just wondering like ah… when you say 13%, do you mean 13% of the 20% who have thought about it? 

00:02:10
STUART MUSZYNSKI About 13% of teens, search(ph) in general study. 

00:02:15
Ah… alright… I’m just wondering ah… how they would find out how, how it is that only 20% of, of America's teens have thought about that. 

00:02:20
STUART MUSZYNSKI Well, you know, are you raising the point that it may be higher? 

00:02:25
Ah… personally, I would imagine that almost everyone ah… has at one-time or another considered suicide it's just something that I think ah… ah… humans in general are concerned with their mortality and I don’t, I can't think of a single person who has not at one-time or another considered death or suicide. 

00:02:45
You know, right now, it’s a very uhm... controversial part of our lives. You know, there is a lot going on, and there is a lot of like ah… internal things that we have to sort out and it’s… it can be very confusing at times. You know, so I think I would agree with Ben(ph) here that I… I… 20% it seems very low, because just of the… the natural of teen life you know, is such that it’s chaotic and uhm… I guess you could say lends itself to thoughts that lead to, sort of maybe lead to sort of, maybe it lead to like thoughts of suicide and things like that. 

00:03:25
IRENE BEVILLE What can adults do uhm… that the adults in your life, what can they do to help prevent these… these feelings? 

00:03:30
You can't prevent feelings uhm… if everyone has the thoughts, they are going to have you know, no matter what’s going on around them and in… in my opinion I mean you cannot ah… do something to prevent someone from thinking about something or feeling about something that, that’s… uhm… that’s a denial of, of human nature. Ah… it… I think maybe to, to help elevate some things ah… honestly parents need to… to be there and let their children know that they are there… but they also have to be willing to accept the fact that the child ah… may refuse that help until they feel they need it. 

00:04:10
STUART MUSZYNSKI What… 

00:04:10
RABBI DANIEL A. ROBERTS National Teen Suicide Expert Well, I, I think your, your statistics in one sense aren’t broad enough. What I mean by that is I, as I understand it somewhere between 300 and 500… 500,000 students in this country every year attempt suicide. Now, you got to ask if you are… if you are somewhere between 4 and 5,000, what is the difference and how come. In part of that answer really is someone reached out, somebody cared, somebody broad in, somebody have authority and got them help. And so many of the… the 4,000 or 5,000 might have… might have been changed if somebody had reached out, helped them, be it in schools, be it with the other fellow students and I think, our greatest problem is we don’t know. Most of us don’t know what to do when it occurs. Most of us are not broad-minded in the sense of knowing, well what are the warning signs and not only what are the warning signs, what do I have to look for and when do I recognize that this person is suicidal rather than just been ah… ah… depressed you know for the moment, or being the typical teenager and when do I have to… to… to do something and then that could next question is what do I do? 

00:05:25
www.projectlove.org To order a videotape copy 

00:05:30
STUART MUSZYNSKI Well, I wanted to… to turn to Dr. Findling on that in a prior show he did, enumerate some of the risk factors, but ah… there…there are as… as Rabbi Roberts just pointing out there is… there is a difference between depression and suicide. And in some cases, difference between depression and even contemplating suicide, so when does a friend know when to jump in? 

00:05:50
DR. ROBERT FINDLING Almost everybody who successfully commit suicide has had a troubled period of time prior to that. So, the question really then moves to detection of what are the troubles. They are not always visible, they are not always apparent, and… but they are always there. And it’s… therefore important for us to be mindful of getting to know what is going on in the youngsters life and what their experiences are. 

00:06:20
RABBI DANIEL A. ROBERTS Well, I think that we have to be uhm… you know somewhat broader when we begin to talk about teenage suicide, uhm… I’m look at what is happening to the youth of America today and how we can help them to prevent destructive behavior. 

00:06:30
I think, I… I think another problem with uhm… trying to prevent suicides among teens is the fact that people kind of taking approach of not wanting to be a part of it, not wanting to be get in the situation where someone who may be contemplating suicide. And there are so times, I know… 

00:06:50
STUART MUSZYNSKI That are not my business or… 

00:06:50
Yeah… 

00:06:50
STUART MUSZYNSKI Or… or… too… too difficult to deal with? 

00:06:55
Yeah, and… and I know there are so times, ahh… I don’t me person(ph) and the other three teens that are on this panel. About times when you just joking around friends, somebody will say you know I’m going to kill myself or you know, I wish I kill myself and sort of things like that. And you don’t and… in going along with that mindset of not really wanting to become part of it. You don’t only question that person and sometimes they are just joking and most of the time they are but sometimes, you know if… 

00:07:20
RABBI DANIEL A. ROBERTS But you don’t go into the airport anymore and… and joke around about having a weapon. And that’s one of the things we got to begin to take seriously, that this is not a joking manner that anybody who you hear that’s much say immediately then I got to do something about them. You cannot… cannot be a joking manner. 

00:07:35
STUART MUSZYNSKI I want to turn you, Elaine for a second. Elaine, can you tell us a little bit about Nicole and… and what would have, would have it made a difference if a friend had gotten to or sooner. 

00:07:50
ELAINE SEELEY Daughter Committed Suicide Uhm… I’m not really sure if it would have made a difference or not. She was uhm… it, well it's been three years now and three years ago, in her high school, uhm… she was picked on, she was teased, she was just you know, really the point of everybody’s jokes and on… it didn’t go on just once in a while it's every single day. So, she wanted to stay home as much as she could to avoid that and uhm… but Nicole was a really quite closed person. She never spoke to anybody about anything. And in her case, I’m sure that if someone had reached out to her, it probably won’t have made a difference, because she was… was she was the person that she was. She just was a very, very closed person. Nobody got through to her. She… she never talk to anybody, not to her sister, not to her friends, not to me, not to her daddy, nobody. 

00:08:50
Authentic Conversations PRINCIPLES Teen Suicide Part 2 

00:08:55
STUART MUSZYNSKI Welcome back. We are talking to a group of students and professionals and parents about teen suicide, the third leading cause of death among America's teenagers. We spoken the last segment about friends intervening and Elaine you said, you weren't sure it would make any difference. Uhm… here is one of the issues we are dealing with and I like to hear from the teens on the panel that you see a problem, you see a problem, individual or person who has a lot of baggage as, as many people say in high school and it’s too difficult and too difficult to get involved and even if you get involved, you don’t even know if you are going to make a difference. Is that an idea that people have? 

00:09:40
Uhm… I would say that… that it might be but that honestly you have to take it on a… on a… on a one to one basis, I mean every single person, I know very few people who don’t have any friends and that one friend who they might have ah… is usually the one who would help ah… in a… in a given situation. I, myself, I, actually showing this to someone else(ph) I have cuts on my wrist and hands scares from keeping someone else from killing themselves and so they, instead decided to attack me. Uhm… my friend still alive and ah… she thanks me for it uhm… sometimes and sometimes she doesn’t. But it needs to be on… on a one to one level ah… 

00:10:25
STUART MUSZYNSKI Would you do it again? 

00:10:25
Yeah, definitely, I would have to. Uhm… I honestly don’t see how anyone could if faced with that sort of situation not, certainly known with any hands(ph) of humanity in them. 

00:10:40
STUART MUSZYNSKI And what about situation where I think somebody mentioned it before, somebody says oh, I’m going to kill myself, you know just casually in a conversation. You don’t know whether to believe them or not and you just kinda hope that they are not going to do it. 

00:10:50
And… and I… I think the way we should go about this you know, just kind to make sure. Don’t do it and like you know, I’m really, really concerned about you. Are you sure, you are not going to kill yourself. You know just kind a… just a kind to make sure they are joking you know and… and kind of keeping on a light, lighthearted kind of situation, because that way… that way if you sense that something may be wrong or things like that, then you can’t go and take it in that situation in a more serious manner instead of just you know… you know just I'm joking around to just make sure that you know, that’s all they are doing. 

00:11:20
IRENE BEVILLE Elementary School Principal But joking is a concern of mind. I think that we have to uhm… you know sensitize staff particularly in schools to watching and listening for those kinds of jokes perse, even notes to the past. Teachers have often come to me and said this is the note that I… that I found. I’m really concerned about what’s been said in this note. And those are kind of things that send up with flags(ph) and I think sometimes we have to determine as adults whether it’s serious or not. 

00:11:45
RABBI DANIEL A. ROBERTS Well and one of the ways and people are very frightened of asking people. Are you thinking about commit… killing yourself and it is very interesting you know, a lot of students who are, who will hide a lot of other things, all of a sudden they gets to the quick and… and they will answer yes, you know, yes, I was thinking, how did you know or… or I’m glad, I could tell you tell, no you're kidding me and… and it gives you a real clue right there and then. So, we shouldn’t be afraid. You are not going to plant it in anybody’s mind. 

00:12:10
Well, I think a lot of people who say, I’m gonna kill myself are asking for attention. 

00:12:15
Yap. 

00:12:15
It’s a cry for help when they say that, when they are… even they were joking around when they said oh, yeah I’m gonna kill myself and it’s a joke you know, it is a cry for help a lot of times. 

00:12:25
STUART MUSZYNSKI And he got a help from, right? 

00:12:25
Yes. 

00:12:25
So how do you… but… 

00:12:25
Well, its… 

00:12:30
So how do you do that? 

00:12:30
Well, what I’m going to say is that if someone really wants to kill themselves ah… it’s… it’s my opinion uhm… that they will and that if they really want to die, there is a fair little bit you can do ah… I think that most of this you know the percentage that you pulled out earlier, most of these people who… who say that they have considered that or even of the people who have actually committed suicide did not want to commit suicide. They are waiting for someone to intervene even at the last moment. 

00:12:55
DR. ROBERT FINDLING Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist But then you have to think about two very important issues that. Number one if that’s the only way you can ask for help. That is the statement about… 

00:13:05
Yeah. 

00:13:05
DR. ROBERT FINDLING About the… place of this youngsters at. But probably even more importantly something that we’re alluding to or really haven't quiet holding on, is the notion associated that thinking about harming yourself, well perhaps needing some form of pure assistants or emotional assistants is it current associated with weakness. 

00:13:25
Yeah. 

00:13:25
DR. ROBERT FINDLING And during and stigma. And in some advice that’s the greatest obstacle of all. 

00:13:30
Hmm…hmm… 

00:13:30
DR. ROBERT FINDLING This is, this is, this is in some regards an illness not a weakness. And, and in, and, and regardless of motivate somebody to feel or act this way the fact that you do… 

00:13:40
Yeah. 

00:13:40
DR. ROBERT FINDLING Tells you something very poignant. 

00:13:45
You know, back towards Ben(ph) and um… Lindsay(ph) said like, if somebody truly, truly want to commit suicide, I don’t think that they like say I’m, I want to kill myself they just do it. Because if they say… like they say it's a call for help, if they say I’m gonna kill myself. 

00:14:00
Yeah, she’s right. 

00:14:00
They're hoping eventually somebody will jump into like. You know say… 

00:14:05
www.projectlove.org To order a videotape copy 

00:14:05
RABBI DANIEL A. ROBERTS But many, many are ambivalent, I mean they, they really do want to kill themselves in one sense and the other sense they really want somebody to rescue them, it is a cry for help. And somebody is got to reach out and cry… and to answer that cry. And the other piece of it, it is there are many who might have killed themselves, ah… but somebody intervene on the other hand there were those who plan for somebody to intervene and they didn’t show up on time. 

00:14:25
IRENE BEVILLE Well, that’s why I asked the question initially, because I think after what happens on a school or to a family that the big question that comes out is what could we have done? What do we miss? What didn’t we see? And so you ask young people what, what can adults do that’s around you. What do we do? 

00:14:40
www.projectlove.org To request a free study guide 

00:14:40
RABBI DANIEL A. ROBERTS Well, the, the first, that I would answer is if students have to learn to break a confidence. They must learn to tell somebody else who was in the the authority. 

00:14:45
Yeah. 

00:14:50
RABBI DANIEL A. ROBERTS Doctor you said it before that they are not experts in way whatsoever most of them, you know they have this friends who’s been complying that’s, that’s not been all of a sudden, it’s been a long time process. And now they don’t know what to do and now they need to learn break a confidence, they got to tell somebody who is in the authority. I would ask you if, if your daughter and somebody comes to you and told you about your daughter, would you have done something, could you have done something. Most of the parents get fooled and don’t know what to do. 

00:15:15
I think one thing that friends can do when they notice a friend maybe there is a constantly complying about how bad their life is or whatever is talked to the person, I know that some of my friends I have just sat down and say look we need to talk. And I, I know it’s helped them a lot. And it’s, it’s comforted me to especially, because you know I feel like I am doing something and I know that it's helping, I can see that it's helping and… 

00:15:40
RABBI DANIEL A. ROBERTS But then you got to be prepared to break a confidence, you got to be prepared to go the parents and tell them. 

00:15:45
STUART MUSZYNSKI And once again as we discussed in the last show, there are times that people don’t say anything and you just have to look for the warning signs, you have to be aware what the warning sign are. 

00:15:50
ELAINE SEELEY As to what if there are no warning signs? 

00:15:55
STUART MUSZYNSKI Well, I wanted to get… 

00:15:55
ELAINE SEELEY In my case, in Nichole's(ph) case they’re absolutely were no warning signs. She was ridiculed at school and this is the big… 

00:16:05
Yeah. 

00:16:05
ELAINE SEELEY …reason why she took her life, because nobody would let up on her. But she never ever one said to anybody, I want to kill myself or I’m going to commit suicide. 

00:16:15
STUART MUSZYNSKI Well, she probably didn’t even have that level of trust in the people at school. 

00:16:20
ELAINE SEELEY Absolutely not and, and there were many-many times when I would say to her, I mean I'm just her mother I knew there was something was wrong with her. And I would say please talk to me, tell me what’s wrong and she would always say, you wouldn’t understand and it will make me understand. Tell me and she never would, she just refused and then so, you know there is, there were no signs to you know try and stop her. 

00:16:40
STUART MUSZYNSKI Were there other, other warning signs, I know Dr. Findly mentioned isolation, heritability a school work dropping. 

00:16:50
ELAINE SEELEY Actually last year in schools her grades had, had improved 100% over the year before. 

00:16:55
www.projectlove.org To Request a free study guide 

00:16:55
RABBI DANIEL A. ROBERTS But the biggest one is which most of these students would notice is giving away possessions, you know and nobody asking why aren’t you gonna need it so to speak, you know why you’re giving this to me. 

00:17:05
Principles Teen suicide Part Two 

00:17:05
ELAINE SEELEY Never did that either. 

00:17:05
DR. ROBERT FINDLING Right, but I think it go through what can teenagers do. Certainly every, every teenagers knows of other kids, who are isolated. 

00:17:15
Hmm…hmm… 

00:17:15
DR. ROBERT FINDLING Who do get ridiculed and you know it’s interesting, you know when people try to gravitate a peer groups it's what happens with teenagers, it happens with adults, it’s happens. But if you talk about what teenagers can do and we're always trying to teach acceptance. This is another thing that certainly teenagers can do. You know, it’s important to recognize that there are always kids who will won't always be able to fit in. 

00:17:35
Oh… 

00:17:35
DR. ROBERT FINDLING And these are the kids that certainly are often times victimized and often times go unnoticed. 

00:17:40
Authentic Conversations Principles Teen Suicide Part 2 

00:17:50
STUART MUSZYNSKI Welcome back to principles, we’re talking with the group of parents and experts and teens about teen suicide the third largest cause of death for America’s teens. Dr. Findling, I would like to go back to you Elaine said that there were no warning signs for her daughter Nichole(ph), except that Nichole(ph) was ridiculed over and over and over again. And in her mind there was really nothing that anyone could have done, so I would like to turn to you and then you know perhaps to, to Rabbi Robert What can a parent do? 

00:18:25
DR. ROBERT FINDLING Well, I think certainly there are also exception to any rules and I think what we know for groups or it's not necessary for any specific individual. But I think what had highlight is the poignant, I think message that teenagers can actually do a lot to help. And I think you know, again I think we always sort of look at teenagers and often times really don’t give them the credit where it's due. And, and then certainly if I think there was a more gracious ability to reach out to your daughter. Certainly that may of actually been a very important thing. 

00:18:55
STUART MUSZYNSKI Yeah, so in Elaine's case if the teens were the problem they could also be the solution. 

00:19:00
DR. ROBERT FINDLING I won’t say they would might have been the only problem, but certainly I would tell you that teens would be a very powerful part of the solution. 

00:19:05
Um… if I may, teens certain with, with my group of friends anyway are always doing things to help even when it looks like we’re not. At my own lunch table just to give a fairly small example, ah… anyone who wishes to sit there is perfectly welcome to unless they make some sort of direct action against, you know those at the table. And we’ve had any number of, of completely different people sit at our table and almost always it ends up that they stay there for quite some time, because an open group is, is a happier group. And even when people have problems with each other we're still able to, to deal with it feasibly so. 

00:19:50
RABBI DANIEL A. ROBERTS That the real kind of goes that most who are contemplating suicide, talk about it somehow, they get the message out through their actions to their words to some of their friends. 

00:20:00
IRENE BEVILLE And I think opening(ph) up friends, since when I was at the middle school we had wellness(ph) days, where suicide was one of the topics and usually after that happened, we had several students who would come to office to report about their friends, who felt free enough at that point to come and talk about things that they knew, that were going on with their friends. So I think schools can do more in terms of making kids aware that it's okay to share that information with another, you know they are trusting adult. And that, it you know and that, that’s a way of demonstrating their friendship. 

00:20:25
STUART MUSZYNSKI And obviously this is not curricular, but it's essential on the school. 

00:20:30
IRENE BEVILLE Right wellness(ph) is, you know it is curricular, it is part of, of the health curriculum emotional, emotional health and mental health is part of the curriculum. 

00:20:40
RABBI DANIEL A. ROBERTS But one of the things you asked before, I think that schools need to be prepared what happens if there is a suicide in their school. And one of the, one of the major things that we have to be very careful not to make this person into a hero. Ah… there is a big worry about contingent within the school system that this person got attention by with the actions. And you know I’ve been thinking about it and boy I can get all this glamour and so forth. And unfortunately when we are younger we think that ah… well something that will happen to us, everyone will feel sorry and then we’ll be back. 

00:21:10
STUART MUSZYNSKI But I have, I have a that troubles me a little bit on the one hand we don’t want to make people into heroes. But on the other hands how can a school system have a human response that, the, the certainly as you know (inaudible ) one of our friends or children… 

00:21:30
RABBI DANIEL A. ROBERTS Instead of a major assembly… 

00:21:30
STUART MUSZYNSKI Yeah.. 

00:21:30
www.projectlove.org 

00:21:30
RABBI DANIEL A. ROBERTS …whether the person is honored and everybody you get them together in a smaller group. 

00:21:35
STUART MUSZYNSKI Okay. 

00:21:35
RABBI DANIEL A. ROBERTS You get the friends together you get all the teachers together you, you pulled them out instead of making this a major catastrophe at, at a school. It is much more that you reach out to the people who are um… who are involved in the… with their students. 

00:21:50
STUART MUSZYNSKI So that doesn’t preclude attending a funeral, doesn't preclude reaching out to the parents. 

00:21:55
RABBI DANIEL A. ROBERTS And in fact I would, my suggestion to parents is that they must reach out and be sensitive to their kids, they have to go to the funeral with their kids. Not just send them, they've to be there with their kids at this particular stage in their life. It’s a very painful and difficult but a process to go through, which will, which will affect them for the rest of their life. 

00:22:10
Although you also need to include those who weren’t involved. 

00:22:15
Yeah. 

00:22:15
Because you like... with, with her daughter, if you are only to involve those who, who were friends with her then the people who're picking on her would have no clue what they did. 

00:22:25
Hmm...hmm... 

00:22:25
They won’t , they won’t understand of what they did to, to maybe cause it or to help it along was wrong and even if a few of them got it, it wouldn’t be wide enough. So I think you need to, to judge each problem individually. Ah… it depending on perhaps the nature of the person’s suicide or a, you know what was happening with that certain group. 

00:22:50
IRENE BEVILLE Most schools have a plan in place. When something like that happens or team of professional come together make decisions about what, what steps to take and how to proceed. And usually that’s done very-very-very well. 

00:23:00
Yeah. 

00:23:00
IRENE BEVILLE About people are there, counselors are there who are trained to deal with the issues the schools have a, you know have a way of making sure that the grieving appropriate grieving takes places. But it doesn’t become the kind of thing that you’re talking about where kids become that persons becomes the model and, and kids become involved in a, in a different kind of way. 

00:23:20
STUART MUSZYNSKI On that note we're gonna, we’re gonna close, I appreciate everybody participating this is one of the critical, critical issues that faces teens and parents. And I just hoped that we’re able to make a difference. 

00:23:30
Authentic Conversations PRINCIPLES Teen Suicide Part 2 

00:23:40
STUART MUSZYNSKI Commentary I think we can summaries dealing with the issue of teen suicide in one word caring. We need to come together as a community, we need to reach out to teens. If we are friend we need to stand up and be a friend, however difficult that is. If we’re parent we need to try to understand the warning signs, if all else fails and in any event, we need to reach out to professionals, guidance counselors need better training in dealing with this. We all need to take it seriously, there are too many people who are dying. Thanks for joining us.
