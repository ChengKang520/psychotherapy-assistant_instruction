MARTY KLEIN How many of you heard me speak yesterday? Wow! Well, we should do something different than exactly the same thing as we did yesterday. Hi, I'm Dr. Marty Klein. I'm a licensed marriage and family therapist, and certified sex therapist. And for the last 35 years I've been studying sexual decision-making and sexual arousal and desire in the relationship between those things. Half of my private practice took place before the year 200 and we'll see in a second how important the year 2000 is in the study of sexuality and pornography. If you have, if you, if you have a cell phone or Apple watch or a vibrator or something please turn it down and as I said yesterday we have two hours, you know, which is like too long for a lot of people to go without a break so, but it's not long enough to take like a 30 minute break. So please feel free to get up and move around or leave when you want to leave. If you have any crinkly you wrapped up, potato chips and things, let's all open them now at the beginning so we don't have that ripple effect, you know. My goal here today is to be helpful. My goal here today is only secondarily to tell you what I think but what I mostly I want to do and what I hope you will have, we will have accomplished by the time we're done today is that you will have some new tools with which to deal with couples. You'll have some new tools to use in dealing with couples who are in conflict, maybe even some tools to use with some individuals. But I'm here to share some tools and part of those tools is a new perspective. I think one of the very few things I learned in graduate school was when my research uh… methodology teacher said to me, "There's nothing so practical as a good theory." So you may recognize this case, he says, "As I see at the biggest stumbling block to our relationship is in fact that when we got married I was too young to recognize mental illness in other people." And when the subject is pornography somehow there are some people who are talking about mental illness. If you want to watch that crap, you know, maybe you're mentally ill. So I hear this in the office all the time. Now some people say, I've got to tell you I'm not pro-porn, I'm not anti-porn, I'm not pro-porn, I'm pro thinking clearly, that's what I'm in favor of, thinking clearly. So I don't want to get pigeonholed as being against porn or in favor of porn, and in fact because of the location of my practice in Silicon Valley and the fact that people know that I deal with sexuality a lot, I had lot of people coming in specifically to talk about pornography. And so I'm very familiar with the pain that people have about pornography. People say, "I watch more than I intend to and I feel guilty about what I watch and I compare myself to porn and I come up short…" You know, "I keep it secret, I hate that and I hate lying to my partner…" And then, you know, from the other side I hear he has a, he has another life, "And I feel left out of it." "I don't understand why he does that stuff." And, "I compare myself to porn and I come up short…" And then there's one more thing that I hear which is, "I don't know why she makes such a big deal out of it. She accuses me of all these crazy things and they're not true, and she doesn't want to listen to what I have to say about it, and then it's hard to connect sexually, it's like she has this thing about what I do." So I know a lot about the pain that people are in about pornography, that's probably what motivated me to get into the work about trying to understand this whole phenomenon. Now as I, as I travel around and I listen to my colleagues or I read what my colleagues write about the subject, these are the typical interventions, these are the typical interventions that I, that I hear or, or read that my colleagues are doing when it comes to pornography, get the guy to stop watching it, get the guy to stop masturbating, getting him, getting him into a twelve-step program, get him to admit that he has intimacy problems, and get him to fix those, and help him deal with his infidelity. So, so far we've got his problem, his problem, his problem, his problem, and then what about her? Well, we have to support her self-esteem. So this is sort of the formula that I see some therapists encourage, some of these some therapists encourage, all of these, this is the formula that I see. And there's a certain coherence to it, you know, there's certain theoretical coherence to it, the only problem is that it's not leading to couples being more sexual or being more adult, and that's really what we have in mind as couples therapist, right? We want couples to be more connected with each other as adults. You can get people connected up if you're willing to have a parent child relationship, but getting people to connect as adults, oh, that's a little more complicated especially when the subject is sexuality. So these are the typical clinical strategies that I see, I don't use any of them except I like to support everybody's self-esteem whether they use porn or not. So what's, what's missing? What's missing? What's missing in this list of typical clinical strategies? What's missing is a discussion about the actual sex life that the couple has. Other than, other than, "We don't have sex." Or other than, "He looks at porn instead of having sex with me." Or other than, "Well, I'm too disgusted with what he does to want to have sex with him." But in terms of, do you like oral sex, in terms of when you have sex, does he ejaculate inside of you or not inside of you? When you have sex, you know, who's putting the pickle in who's nose, we, you know, the people, I mean in our field in general people don't talk about sex very much. And when it comes to pornography, a lot of people are treating couples in distress about pornography and they're not talking about sexuality. It's kind of an anomaly but, but there you have it. A lot of people, a lot of therapists are not, when they're dealing with pornography they're not talking about the question of, is it legitimate for somebody to masturbate if they're in a couple? I'm talking about pornography without talking about masturbation that just makes no sense at all 'cause almost nobody looks at pornography without masturbating. If they do, I want to know why? Like is that the music? Is that the acting? What exactly is it about pornography that you like if you're not masturbating? And if you just like watching movies, I recommend Lawrence of Arabia. I love that movie, I love that movie, including the music, I love that movie. What's also missing when you look at these typical clinical strategies, what's also missing is an assessment of the couple's communication skills of the couple's conflict management and the couple's power dynamics. And indeed, that's what I want to spend a lot of time talking, talking to you about today.

MARTY KLEIN These are the things that I want to talk about, not these, these. Now please come with me back to Labor Day 1999. Imagine its Labor Day 1999. Almost all of you had already been born by then. Let's say it's Labor Day in 1999, we're sitting in my backyard, and we're having a nice glass of white wine in my case, red wine in your case probably. So we're sitting around, we're sitting around and relaxing in my backyard, and its Labor Day in 1999, and we're kind of relaxed and talking about all these interesting things, and then you say, "What do you suppose would happen if the country got flooded with free 24/7 pornography?" Now that's an interesting question. You know, we could have, we could, you know, what would happen to the Red Sox if they got a better Relief Pitcher? You know, we could wonder, you know, what would happen, you know, if they invented those self driving cars that they keep talking about? What do you suppose would happen if the country were flooded with free 24/7 on demand pornography? What do you suppose would happen? And we could talk about that, we're friends, we could talk about, "Oh, I bet everybody would like quit their job and just look at porn." "Oh, I bet everybody would lose weight to look like porn actors." "Oh, I bet everybody would get divorced." Or, "Oh, everybody would lose their job 'cause they always sit in their home looking at porn." You know, we could talk about, what do you suppose would happen? What do you suppose would happen? Well, that's what happened. That's what happened. That is exactly what happened because in the year 2000, right after Labor Day of 1999, in the year 2000 that's when the internet technology changed from dial-up modems to broadband internet. Broadband internet came to the United States in 2000 and within an extremely short period of time, everybody could get free 24/7 porn in their house and many people in their office, even in the military people getting 24/7 high quality porn overnight, overnight. And so now we kind of have this natural experiment what social scientists say is a natural experiment, we have the world before this event, we have the world after this event. And we could actually look at what happened. Well, we could have spent the last 17 years looking at what happened if we really wanted to look at it and it turns out that some people really are curious about that and other people not so curious. Some people are so upset that they don't really want to look at what happened or they're so upset that they take a few facts and they stitch them away, stitch them together in a way that leads to not so helpful conclusions. So part of what I want to do for the next couple hours is help you look at, "Okay, so what actually happened?" Now we know that one of the things that happened is that almost overnight we started getting a lot of couples complaining about this, right? We know that that have, what else happened? What is the social and cultural and historical context of this earth shaking event of broadband internet? Bringing very high definition, perfectly match sound and pictures, pornography into everybody's house. Now if you were my workshop yesterday this is already a familiar picture to you, this is a common model of how porn affects consumers. It's very common and I don't agree with this model but this is the common model which is that people use pornography and it drags them away from their relationships. And that people think about porn when they're having sex with their partner and that, and then they disconnect emotionally from their partner, it is very common model. Maybe even some of us in this room have been using this model without even being aware of it. And then you remember yesterday I proposed a contrasting model which is not that porn leads to these various conclusions or outcomes but, oops, but rather that something leads people to withdraw from their relationships, and some thing leads people to dissociate or disconnect from their partners during sex. And that's been going on since approximately the beginning of time. Porn did not invent these things. Porn did not invent people complaining, you know, when we have sex you seem a million miles away, porn didn't invent a problem. And like I said, I've been practicing since 1980, some of you have too, you were getting that complaint on the very first day that you opened your private practice. No matter when you opened your private practice, you were getting that complaint on day one. You seem a million miles away when we have sex. And I'm, I'm more interested in this relationship than you are, how come you're not as interested? You're always working or you know whatever it is. Porn didn't invent these problems but suddenly after porn came into everybody's house somebody's got the brilliant idea that it's the poor and that's the reason for those phenomena, those admittedly complicated phenomena, those admittedly painful phenomenon. I mean it is legitimately painful to be sexual with someone and they seem like they're a million miles away. Of course, that's painful. You're more invested in the relationship than they are, of course that's painful. They seem like they'd rather be someplace else instead of having dinner with you, of course that's painful, and all that stuff was going on for (inaudible) years. And then 17 years ago broadband internet brought high-quality pornography into everybody's house and that stuff continued to happen. So what are some of the causes, you know, let's solve for X, right? What are some of the causes that people withdraw from their relationships? What are some of the reasons that people disconnect from their partners during sex? Well, we know the answer to that. It's one or more of these things, shame, anxiety, lack of differentiation, the fact that the couple quarrels on a regular basis, you know, that low grade chronic conflict that you think I'd rather be dead than be in that relationship. I mean, a big fight twice a year is one thing but little bits of bitching all the time, and then people are surprised when they don't have sex, right? Little pot shots, little, yes, that what you told your mother last week. That stuff keeps people from feeling close to each other. So the most common configuration of pornography in relationships looks like this, pornography use is over their, relationship is over there, which is to say that they are orthogonal. For the most part in most couples, in most couples pornography use does not really affect the relationship. And some people get really upset about it, but the thing that they're upset about it turns out not actually a pornography. Now we're, we're very big believers in diversity in our field especially lately and we want to give everybody a voice, you know, returning combat vets deserve a voice and left handed people deserve a voice, and we certainly, well, we want, in this field that's what we're doing now in graduate training programs, everybody should have a voice, and if you read the California therapist or whatever therapy magazine your region is, articles about dealing with these kind of people, and dealing with those kind of people, the only kind of people that I can, that I can see who don't get a voice are the people who use pornography. And there are 60 or 70 million of them. Our field, our field gives a lot of air time to people who feel hurt by pornography, people who are upset about the alleged connections between pornography and trafficking, people who have PTSD, and people who they hear about pornography and they're afraid they're going to get raped, and I'm very sympathetic about all the stuff. But if you talk to people who use pornography, which apparently very few people actually do, but if you, if you talk to people who use pornography, what do they actually say? What do they actually say? They mostly say, "Yeah, it's nice to do that sometimes." Sometimes they say, "Yeah, I probably do it more than I should, but, you know, I get involved with it." Some of them say, "Well, yeah, I mean, since the sex that I'm having with my partner is really not that interesting and not that frequent, you know, this kind of a nice supplement." It's like if you're not getting enough vitamin C, you know, you take one of those gigantic pills. Most people who look at porn, if you ask them, if you say, "Well, you know, since using porn is so easy and so satisfying, is that better than a good relationship?" Most people who look at porn say, "Duh, no." Notice the question, a good relationship. Now if you ask people, "You're in a relationship and you have sex three times a year and each time you have sex with your partner it last roughly two minutes, is masturbating to porn more satisfying than that? People say, "Duh, yeah." And I'll tell you one other thing that people who look at porn say or in this case don't say, if you ask people who look at porn, if you go up to a person who looks at porn and you say to them, "Hey listen, I've never looked at porn and I'm thinking that, you know, a lot of people do it and I'm thinking maybe I would start doing now. And you've been looking at porn now for ten years or 100 years or whatever it is, what's your opinion? Do you think that I should look at porn? Do you think I should not look at porn?" Very few porn users will say, "Oh, Jeez I'm glad you asked. Don't get started with that, I mean, it'll kill you. Don't get started with that." Very few porn users actually say that. Now, how many people here have ever smoked cigarettes? Raise your hand. You foolish people. My parents both smoked when I was growing up and I remember my parents, now back in those days, you know, the worst thing in the world what they were trying to protect me from was, "Oh, God, don't smoke cigarettes." You know, it wasn't, "Oh, don't take LSD." It was, "Don't smoke cigarettes." You know. But if you ask, if I would ask you about a third of the people who are used to smoke, if I would have asked you why you were smoking cigarettes? If I would come up to you and say, "Listen, I've never smoked and I'm thinking maybe I should start, maybe I shouldn't start, I don't know, what's your opinion? Do you think I should start smoking?" What would you all say? 

00:19:20
UKNOWN No! 

00:19:20
MARTY KLEIN Exactly. Every smoker has the same answer, "Oh, don't get started with that crap." "Oh, you do not believe me, I've been doing it for nine years, you know, I've been doing it for 100 years, you don't want to do that." You ask people who look at porn which is just another consumer product, a legal consumer product, "Do you think I should, do you think I should stay away from porn?" Most porn consumers will say, "Well, why would you stay away from it? Not that big deal." So isn't that contrast interesting? Isn't that interesting? Isn't that interesting? We as an industry are completely uninterested in the contrast between what porn users say about their experience and what their partners are complaining about. As an industry, we pay a lot of attention to the complaints about my partner looks at porn and dot, dot, dot, and I'm very sympathetic about the pain that people are in, I talked about in the very first slide, the very first slide, the pain that the partners of porn consumers are in. I'm very sympathetic about that. But where is the curiosity in our field about the contrast between people who use it, what they say and people who don't use it and what they say? As a field we don't seem that interested in that contrast and frankly, when I see couples in the office, there are exceptions, but I would say at least two thirds of the people complaining about their partner's porn use, they're not all that interested in why their partner does it, in what they're looking at, in why they seem so attached to it, why they're willing to endure conflict in the relationship in exchange for being able to do it? For the most part, when I work with these couples, partly what I have to do is get people curious about each other's perspective. Now everybody knows that we should turn to the porn user and say, "You know, your porn is very upset about the fact that you use porn, are you curious enough about your partner's upset?" And a lot of people aren't. Okay, but a lot of therapists are not turning to the partner and saying, "You know, your partner seems to enjoy doing this thing and he says it's no big deal." And you see more of that, you don't seem more like curious about your partner's interest in this activity, it's kind of curious. I mean generally you're interested in everything that he does. So we need to be asking as, "Okay, you look at porn. Why do you prefer looking at porn? Why do you prefer looking at sexy pictures or reading sexy stories to sexual activity with your partner?" Why? Why? Now some people, some therapist they think they, they have an answer to that. Affect dysregulation is one very complicated answer to that question. I mean, you don't hear, patients say that. Insufficient attachment, you don't hear, patients say that but you heard some therapist say that. But how about, how about listening to the people who actually do it? They will tell us if we ask. They will tell us if we ask and if you have a partner who looks at porn which is to say if you have a partner, if you have a partner, if you, if you have a partner who looks at porn and you want to know how they feel about, what you have to do is ask them. Now part of the reason that a lot of therapists don't ask their patients about pornography is because they don't especially want to ask their patients about masturbation. And if you want to talk about pornography, you've got to talk about masturbation. If I asked you, "How do you like The Daily Show?" Which, I was on The Daily Show once. It wasn't that good, you know, a two hour interview and they cut it down to like 45 seconds, terrible shame, terrible shame. But if I asked you, "How do you like The Daily Show?" You might say, "Oh, The Daily Show, that, that's crap. The Daily Show, it's stupid, it's adolescent, it's crap." Okay. And then if I were to say to you, "Well, how do you like television in general?" And they say, "Oh, television, that's crap." So, oh, if you think that television is crap, we don't need to talk about The Daily Show, right? Well, it's the same thing with pornography. Assuming of course that most people who look at pornography, they're doing it in conjunction with masturbation, right? So if you asked somebody how do you feel about pornography or if they tell you that they think its terrible stuff, but you don't ask about masturbation, you're only getting half the picture. So let's say that you say to somebody, "Well, forget about pornography for a second, how do you feel about the fact that your partner masturbates?" And if they say, "Oh, that's not okay." You can stop talking about pornography. Because the real issue, at least the place that you're going to slide into the topic with this couple is, so he wants to masturbate, you don't want him to masturbate, let's talk about that and we'll talk about what's in his head while he's masturbating later. The step one is masturbating, self pleasuring, whatever you want to call it, is that a legitimate activity in the culture of this couple? And if it's not, let's talk about that. Now I have my own ideas about whether or not masturbation's a legitimate activity. If two people agree that it's not, I'm not going to push them, "Oh, come on, why don't you guys start doing it or why don't you make it okay?" But if one person says it's a legitimate activity and the other person says no, it's not, that's got to be talked about. Is that a comfortable conversation for us? Generally not. But if masturbation is not a legitimate activity in a couple or one person thinks or believes it's not a legitimate activity then talking about pornography is pointless, it's just pointless. So actually the conversation about pornography really should be about masturbating with pornography, it's a lot of syllables, and polite people don't like to use the word masturbate, but there you have it. It's really not about porn, in clinically speaking, I'm not talking about social policy now, I am talking a clinically speaking. When I talk to Congress, it's a whole different story. I don't need to use the word masturbate when I talk to Congress, they can do that themselves. So okay, so if you ask people why do you prefer masturbating to pornography, with pornography to partner sex? They will tell you, what will they tell you? They say, "Well, the sex is more satisfying for one thing." That's not necessarily a pathology. 

00:26:15

00:26:20
MARTY KLEIN If you look at your own experience, unless you're unusually blessed, you may have had sexual experiences that when you look back on them you might think to yourself, "You know, ten minutes with my right hand would have been better, hell of a lot better and less complicated." Right? Well, for some people that's their marriage and it's sad but for some people that's their marriage, that, the sex with their partner is not terribly satisfying. And we could address that, we could address that, the way to address that is not to talk about one of the parties masturbating with pornography, the way to address that is by addressing that. Why else would people prefer masturbating with pornography to porn and sex? Well, because there's always conflict in the couple and so sex with their partner not that available or not that satisfying or they don't want to give their partner pleasure when their partner just called them a lot of names yesterday, most people do not have performance anxiety when they masturbate, they don't sit down and say, "Gee, I hope I satisfy myself tonight." And one of the things that I think our field needs to be reminded of over and over and over again is just how anxious so-called normal people are about sex, that how many people they approach the bedroom worrying that they're going to make a mistake, that their body is going to emit some smell or substance that they don't want, that their partner is going to be disappointed, that their partner is not going to think that they're attractive, I think we tend to forget that, especially therapists who have a good sexual relationship in their own personal life, I think we sometimes forget about the enormous number of people who when they approach sex, they are way less comfortable than when they approach the lunch table or when they approach a book or when they approach riding a bicycle or when they approach weeding. So one nice thing about masturbating with porn is that there's no performance anxiety and for some people, that's just a gigantic relief. There's no conflict about, "Could we please do this?" "No, I don't want to do that." There's no conflict about, "I don't want to do this." "Well, I do." There's no conflict about, "How many times do I have to tell you I do not want to pickle in the nose during sex?" "How many times do I have to ask you please do more of this?" No conflict about any of that when you masturbate and you know, when couples only have sex three times a year which is a significant percentage of your practice unless you see adolescence. 

00:29:05
[sil.] 

00:29:10
MARTY KLEIN But if you see, if you see grown ups, if you see grown ups, a significant number of the grown up couples that you see, they're only having sex three, they're having sex only three or four times a year. And when you have sex only three or four times a year, sort of gathering up your thing, you know, your energy to do that is very complicated. You know, if you have sex twice a week, you always have a loop in the house, you know, exactly where your birth control is if you use birth control, you know, it's easy to remember if your partner likes her nipples pinched or not or whatever it is, but, you know, if you only have sex once every three or four months, "Oh, Gee, do we have any loop?" Or "Oh, did you get condoms?" "Did I get condoms?" And it's just a big hassle. It's just a big hassle, we forget that. And of course with masturbation to porn there is no issue about, about birth control or fertility. In my last book, Sexual Intelligence I talked about a case of a couple who both found each other, a married couple, they found each other extremely… sexually attractive and had a great sex life and then one of them decided they wanted to have another kid and the other one didn't, and so every time they had intercourse it was preceded by, "Let's use birth control." "No, I don't want to." "Yes, I do." "No, I don't." "Yes, I do." You can imagine how much fun that made the intercourse. And eventually they stopped having intercourse and eventually they stopped having sex, and that's when they came to see me. So the fact that there are no fertility or contraceptive conflicts when you masturbate with porn, for some people is a big plus, is a big plus. Now for some people masturbating with porn is a way to avoid certain kinds of psychological issues that all of us have to deal with. You know, those existential issues that come along with being a human being, like, you know, the question about uh… how you deal with the fact that your body is aging and changing the way that it functions or, you know, how dependent or intertwined you are with the partner. And everybody's got to deal with that stuff, everybody's got to deal with that stuff. And you know, some of us deal with that better than others. Some people, the way that they deal with, well, it is sort of by avoiding relationship issues by just masturbating to porn. Let's not blame pornography for that strategy. You know, people have been avoiding developmental tasks since the beginning of time. People have been avoiding dealing with existential issues since the beginning of time and the fact that now masturbating to internet porn is one more way that people can avoid resolving those issues. Let's not just go after the porn for that, let's be sympathetic in fact that somebody at the age of 53 still has not worked out their ambivalence about closeness. And if they were using any other vehicle to avoid working out that issue, we would be way more sympathetic, but somehow, if the way that somebody is trying to avoid working out their ambivalence about intimacy, if the way that they're trying to avoid working that out is by looking, masturbating to porn instead of having sex with their partner, people blame the porn and people say you've got to stop looking at porn. It's not terribly sympathetic and even worse is not very effective. It's not very effective. For some people masturbating to porn is their strategy for staying married or staying in a long-term relationship where the sex either never was very good or it has ended. For some people it's what they do instead of having an affair and for some people, its part of being dishonest with their partner. But let's not blame porn for these things, okay. Let's not blame porn for these things. And the fact that masturbating with porn is the only time that somebody feels alive, let's not condemn porn for being the vehicle that they have cleverly discovered for feeling alive. You know, for some people its playing golf, playing golf is the only time that they feel alive. For some people, you know, coming to therapy conferences is the only time they feel alive, got to really be sympathetic about that. So yesterday we talked a lot about long-term monogamy, we talked about how, what is normative? What is expectable? What is statistically the single most common outcome of long-term sexual exclusivity? Is that the sex gets less frequent, less intimate, less interesting, and less nourishing, don't blame me, I'm just the messenger. It's not my fault. It is not my fault. If it were up to me it wouldn't be like this but it is. And so everybody who wants to be in a long-term relationship has to figure out what do they want to do about this, this, this thing that's looming ahead, this destiny that looms ahead of them. And different people do different things about this. For some people it's serial monogamy, every eight years it's a new partner. For some people, for some people it's staying in the couple but having affairs. For some people, it's losing interest in sex. If both people lose interest in sex at the same time, they can have a 47 year of marriage and a lot of people when they hear, "Oh, you've been married for 47 years, congratulations." Nobody says, "Forty seven years, when was the last time you got laid?" But as we said yesterday, you know, monogamy is easy if both people lose interest in sex and that's what a lot of couples do. That's not 'cause they're bad people, it's just one of the ways that people adapt to this very common destiny. And so what do people do? What do people do? It's not like it's a big secret, it's not like if two people are in a couple and this couple doesn't have sex anymore, this couple hasn't had sex in five years, it's not like one of them knows it and the other one doesn't, right? They both know it. They both know it, do they talk about it? Generally not. Generally not, 'cause to talk about it is excruciating the painful. Talking about, "Herman, I love you. I like you. You're funny guy, you're great grandpa. You're even neat and tidy around the house." Whatever happened to our sex life anyway? Didn't we used to have sex? I specifically remember we used to have sex. And now we don't have sex anymore, what's up with that, dude? Couples don't want to have that conversation and I don't blame them. I've sat through the occasional conversation like that and it's one of those conversations in therapy where you look at the clock and then you look at the clock 20 minutes later, and the minute hand has moved by one minute, and you say the clock must be broken. You ever had one of those sessions? This is one of those sessions where people are actually talking about, "We used to have sex twice a week, now we have sex twice a year." "We used have sex once a year, now we have sex never." Really painful for people to happen and people would rather do anything other than have that conversation. People would even be willing to quarrel about the fact that one of them looks at pornography instead of having that conversation. Now… Couples, long-term couples have been losing their sexual interest in each other since before internet pornography, you know, that didn't just start in the year 2000, I specifically remember when I opened my practice in 1980, people were already talking about that and I have a suspicion that people are talking about before 1980. Of course people talk about that. People talk about that, I mean people have that issue now more than ever because people are living longer than ever. You know, monogamy, when one person has the courtesy to die when they're 34 years old, you know, not that big a deal, right? People live to be 84 years old. One of my favorite comedian Jimmy Carr, he said he was thinking about getting married and he did some research online and he said, "Do you know half of all marriages last forever?" He said it was terrifying. Half of all marriages last forever, who wouldn't be scared of that? So I think what we're looking at when we see people quarreling about pornography, I mean, I think we're looking at a number of things which I've already talked about but one of the things that we're looking at is people not talking about whatever happened to our sex life. And you don't have to be 63 years old to wonder whatever happened to our sex life, there are people who are 33 years old who are wondering what happened to our sex life. I want to talk briefly about what I call the anti-porn critique. I know people have been objecting to pornography certainly since the year 2000, people were objecting to pornography before that when Playboy started to be published in the 1950s, anybody remember who was on the cover the first Playboy?

UNKNOWN Marilyn Monroe. 

00:38:35
MARTY KLEIN Marilyn Monroe, that's right. When Playboy was first published some people got upset, it was almost exclusively religious people and when Playboy was first published, I mean that's a fact, I'm not making that up, that's a fact. When Playboy was first published people said, "You know, it's bad to look at Playboy, it'll undermine your morals. It'll turn you into a bad person or it means you're a bad person." The anti-porn critique, when Playboy was first published was about the person looking at the pornography. It was an immoral reality model. Looking at pornography was immoral, masturbating was a sin, and so you shouldn't do it. Eventually that argument began to carry less and less weight as American culture changed. American culture changed in the late '60s, people experimenting with sex a lot more, people becoming more accepting of various sexual alternatives. In 1973 after Roe v. Wade, the religious right mobilized to become more politically active, they had a historic meeting in Colorado Springs, they laid out a very ambitious political agenda, a certain amount of it had to do with sexuality. It's not at all a coincidence that only a few years after that with the presidency of George Bush that we saw the implementation of abstinence only sex education. That was part of the political agenda laid on in 1973 after Roe v. Wade. So the combination of the political activism of the religious right and the changes in sexuality in the late '60s and a couple of other things, it led to a change in the criticism of pornography. No longer was pornography to be criticized as something that was bad for the porn user, now it was a public health problem and it was a problem for everybody. So it used to be, "You shouldn't look at porn because it's bad for you." Now it has become, "You shouldn't look at porn because it's bad for everybody, it's bad for your marriage, it's bad for your kids, it's bad for your family, it's bad because it leads to sex trafficking and domestic violence. It's bad because it encourages child porn." All of these things that today seem so common, all of these critiques that are so common, they're brand new, they're new and the clinical importance of this is that people are coming in clinically and they're saying these things. They're saying, "Herman, I don't want you to look at porn because it leads to sex trafficking." "Herman, I don't want you looking at porn because that leads to people looking at child porn." "Herman, I don't want you looking at porn because it leads to rape." And we need to be able to understand the historical context of this brand new way of people talking about their own pain. It's not a very clinically appropriate way for people to talk about their own pain to talk about people being trafficked from Thailand into the United States to provide the entertainment that I think you're watching. That is not clinically appropriate. What's clinically appropriate is those good old, I'm frightened, I'm sad, I'm angry, I'm lonely, I'm confused, yeah that's clinically appropriate but what we have now is all these activists who are claiming that they are stakeholders in the anti-porn critique. And that includes people who believe in the fantasy of porn addiction. Yes, I said it. That includes a whole new industry which I predicted back in the 1980s when I wrote my critique about the concept of sex addiction in the wake of Patrick Oren's his famous book in 1985 which we all know as Out of the Shadows, right? So, so back in 1999, we said, "What do you suppose would happen if the country were flooded with free 24/7 porn? And that's why I wrote this book. And people asked about the title of this book, I'll tell you about the title of this book, His Porn Her Pain. If you talk to gay male couples, very little conflict about pornography. If you talk to lesbian couples, very little conflict about pornography. If you talk to heterosexual couples, you don't hear a lot of men complaining about the women used to pornography. If there's conflict in a couple about pornography, the configuration is almost exclusively his porn and her pain. And those of you, you know, who have followed my writing over the years you know that I'm always talking about the similarities between male and female sexuality, here's a difference. I admit it, here's a difference. So what would happen if the country were flooded with porn? Let's look at what did happen. Now I'm not making this up, these are federal statistics. These are statistics from the Center for uh… uh… Center for Crimes Against Children Research Center in New Hampshire, David Finkelhor. Now the 2015, that should be on the other side of 2010, that should be there, right? That would be confusing. Time went backwards, let's blame pornography I guess. So we can all agree that between the year 2000 and the year 2015, the available pornography went up, we can all agree on that. The question is what about, "Oh, I don't know sexual assault?" Is that some we care about? Yes. What happened to the rate of sexual assault? It has gone down. In real life, the rate of sexual assault has gone down since the year 2000. What about "Oh, divorce?" Anybody here interested in divorce? The rate of divorce has gone down since the year 2000. The rate of child sexual exploitation has gone down since the year 2000. Now we're too, we're too sophisticated to say, well, this proves that if you want less rape and less child abuse, you need more porn. Although, although we should be intrigued by the fact that this is the same graph that you would see if you were in Japan, Croatia, Denmark, Hong Kong, the Czech Republic, very interesting and all these cultures that are very different from the American culture. The introduction of more pornography leads to a decline in these indicators of social pathology, very interesting. At the very least we can say, you know, people who say that porn use leads to all this rape and divorce and all that stuff, we could say actually that's not what happened. And you know we say an engineer, that's a person who says yes it works in real life but would it work in theory, right? So when activists try and sell us the theory, the theory that porn use leads to these various kinds of social dislocations, we can say, "Well, that's your theory but let's look at the fact, here is the facts. They are not my facts. They are not my facts, they're facts." And clinically this data is irrelevant. I never use this information clinically. I know this information. When I talk to policymakers, I use this information, but clinically, I don't use this information. I think it's important for us to know, but I don't use it with patients. When the patient says, "I'm afraid, I don't want George looking at porn because men look at porn and they go and rape people." I say, well, I don't say actually that's not true, I don't say that. I say, "Oh, you think that men look at porn and they go and rape people? Are you concerned that George is going to look at porn and rape somebody?" And the person always says, "Oh, not George." "Yeah, so then what's your point? What is the clinical issue here that we're talking about when you say I don't want George to look at porn because other men look at porn and then other men they rape women when they look at porn, what is the clinical relevance of that?" What I want to know is how do you feel? "I feel left out. I feel lonely. I feel sad. I feel unattractive." That is stuff that we can talk about. That is definitely stuff that we can talk about. So what should we be concerned about? You know, a chicken in every pot and porn and every in every computer, you've got to be old enough to know the reference I guess, a chicken in every pot. Here's what we should be concerned about. We should be concerned about the fact that young people are getting their ideas about sex from pornography but I probably mean that differently than some other people mean that. Now you know porn leads to unrealistic expectations, right? You look at porn and it gives you an unrealistic idea of how easy it is to get a plumber to come to your house. The real, the real modeling problem with porn is that porn has actors and actresses who are acting in ways that are not exactly the way that real life is. Porn doesn't show real life, porn is not a documentary, right? Porn is not a documentary. What does porn leave out? Porn leaves out all of the stuff that is not visually arresting like hugging. Now in real life hugging is an important part of sex, right? Especially, you know, if the sex is enjoyable. I mean, one of the ways you know that sex has going down the hill is when people don't hug during sex. Here's a real way to know if the sex is going downhill, do the people kiss during sex? When people don't kiss during sex, oh, watch out. And when people say, you know, "Yeah, the sex is okay." I want to know, do you kiss during sex? And when people say, "No." I say, "Hmm…" So here are many of the things that get left out from porn and young people don't realize that, in fact a lot of adults don't realize that either. This is the real problem with the modeling of pornography. The overwhelming majority of pornography is not violent. In fact the overwhelming majority of pornography depicts people doing stuff that you used to do when you first met somebody before the sex got routine, right? What most pornography shows that people who are happy and smiling and getting along and oh, by the way let's have sex, and the sex is lot of fun and now we're done, let's go on to the next thing. So the problem with young people looking at porn is not nearly so much that they're looking at violence stuff. The reason that most porn is not violence is very simple, most consumers of porn don't want to look at violence stuff, its real simple, it's real simple. If everybody want to look at violent porn, that's all it would be. Most people don't want to look at that so that's mostly not what there is. But what there is, is depictions of sexuality that leave out the rich texture of sexuality that adults want and hope to have and in many cases used to have. So the talking, the laughing, the hugging, that's what gets left out because it's boring to watch. You ever watch other people hug? If you're not getting paid to watch other people hug, it's boring. It's boring. What we also don't see in pornography is all the stuff that goes on offstage and there's a lot of stuff that goes on in pornography before the cameras start to roll. You know, there's going to be anal sex, you know, people are having enemas if there's anal sex, people packing their butt with lube. If there's going to be like a really huge penis, off camera woman is packing her vagina with lube, you know, men maybe taking erection drugs off stage, and if there's any sort of SMCs, people before the cameras roll, people are sitting and talking it over. "How far back can I bend your legs before it hurts? I want to know exactly 'cause I don't want you to be hurt during the scene, you know…" "The scene calls for me to play with your nipples. Do you like them pinched, do you like them pulled, do you like them turned, which one?" "Turned? Okay, I'll just lower myself to that. I'll turn them. You don't want me to pull them out. I won't pull them, no problem." That's what goes on off camera and if our young people or our adults were savvy about media, they would assume that stuff like that goes on. But our young people and most adults are not savvy about media at all, they watch very sophisticated stuff but they're not very sophisticated consumers of media. And so they don't think about what goes on off camera. So everybody has a narrative about pornography, right? People have narratives, we know our narratives. A lot people take facts or alleged facts and they stitched in together. So when couples argue about porn, what are they actually arguing about? What are people actually arguing about when they argue about porn? I would suggest that they're mostly not arguing about porn, maybe they're arguing about masturbation, maybe what they're arguing about is sex, maybe. A lot of what they're arguing about is power. A lot of what they are arguing about is power. If you have a couple who, one of them wants a dog and the other one doesn't want a dog, they go back and forth a little bit and you say this is about a dog, this about a dog, sooner or later they stop arguing about dogs and now the argument power, who has the right to decide whether or not we're going to have a dog in this house 'cause now it's a one-one tie, everybody votes, you know, they have a cooperative conversation, here all the good reasons I want to have a dog, here all the good reasons I don't want to have a dog, then we call for the vote and what is the vote? The vote is a one to one. How are we going to break this tie? Now in some couples we break the tie by, "Look, I'm the one who makes the money in this house I get to decide whether or not we have a dog." Right? Some people say, "Look the reason we're living in California the first place is because you wanted us to live close to your mother therefore, I get to decide whether or not we have a dog." Right? Some couples say, "You know, I think that it's a crucial thing for the kids to learn responsibility by having a dog and since I'm mostly the one with the childcare responsibilities, I've got the expertise and I say we get to have a dog." So different couples resolve the question of whether or not they're going to have a dog based on criteria that have nothing to do with dogs, right? And if they were real cooperative couple they will talk about this in a cooperative way but if they're not such a cooperative or such a conscious couple, they will have a raw, bruising power struggle about this and think that they're talking about dogs. And it's the same thing with pornography. If one person wants to watch porn and the other person doesn't want them watching porn. You know, it's not like the person who watches porn say, "And I demand that you watch porn too." I hardly ever see that. I hardly ever see that. You know, usually it's I tell you what, "You know, you do what you want to do and I do what I want to do." Which happens to be watch porn and you know, "We'll all get along." And the other the person say, "No, no, no." You know, it's like that whole thing about gay marriage, you know, people who are against gay marriage I would say well, if you're against gay marriage, don't marry a gay person. No, no, no. I don't want to marry gay person. I don't want you Mr. Gay person to be able to marry gay person either. So here are some common narratives that people develop about their partners porn use and the number one thing is your porn use is about me and I don't like that. And frankly, I wouldn't like that either. I'm not saying I think that that's accurate, but if somebody thinks that, well, of course, that would be upsetting. Other common narratives are, "I know why you look at porn, you look at porn because I'm not desirable." "Oh, I know why you look at porn it's because you'd rather look at pictures of people who are more attractive than I am." Or "Looking at porn is not normal, it's not manly, it's not Godly. It's not this, it's not that… And by the way I have a right to ban it from our home. I have the right to a porn free home." I have the right to a porn free home. You know, you could, you could see that point of view.

MARTY KLEIN My wife and I are historians in real life. And we travel around the world and we collect really cool stuff. We're still trying to pick up a copy in the Magna Carta but we have a lot of trouble finding one for sale, 12/16, we could look it up. It's not out of the question that one of us would have, we're both Jewish by the way. It's not out of the question that it would happen that one of us would be in a place where we could buy the V flag that flew over Hitler's bunker, it's not out of the question that we might, one of us might stumble over that. You know with the Swastika and you know all that. And it's not out of the question that if one of us stumbled on this thing that we would say it, "Wow, now there is a historical artifact. I'm going to buy that, I'm going to bring that home." And if my wife actually bought that and brought it home I would say, "Honey, what's this? Have you had like a conversion experience?" My wife would say, "Well, you know, I know it's a Swastika and all but dig it, get this thing was flying over Hitler's bonkers, this is like such an amazing thing." And I might say, "You know, you're absolutely right. This is an amazing thing, I don't want this in my house." And my wife is like, "Oh, but, honey…" And I'd say, "Yeah, but, honey…" So we would go back and forth and eventually we would figure out what to do and here's what I would not do to be perfectly honest. I would not say, "I forbid you from having that in my house." I would not say that. I would not say, "I forbid you from buying any clothing made in China with child labor." I would not say, "I forbid you from eating veal because it involves torturing those little animals." I might try and talk you out of or into any of these things but I would not say, "I forbid you from doing that." And I think that most of you are pretty sympathetic to that way of looking at relationships that we don't want to endorse one partner saying to the other I forbid you from doing this, right? You don't want your porn or doing something, you sit them down, you talk to them, and you make your case convincingly and you pitch it however you want to pitch it. But I don't know how many of us are in favor of relationships where one person gets to forbid the other one from doing something until the subject is pornography. If you ask me a straight on question, do I think somebody has the right to a porn free home? I would say, "I think everybody has the right to advocate for a porn free home, but if you live with somebody else you have a contract with them." Right? And the contract is that when we disagree on how we want to live, we talk about it. "You call that a clean bathroom?" "Yeah, I call it a clean bathroom. Well, we better talk about it." Right? This is very difficult clinical stuff. People don't want to hear that they don't have a right that they think they have a right, you know. I'm not in favor of people forbidding each other. Alan Baxter has a wonderful expression. You know, she says that when one person says to the other person I forbid you from doing that, that's an invitation to secrecy. I love that expression. And whenever I use it I quote Alan, very smart. So the narrative that people put together about their partners porn use is part of the problem in fact the narrative that people put together about anything that they don't like about their partner is part of the problem, right? You know it's not simply, "When you play golf every single Sunday and I don't go play golf with you I feel unimportant, I feel left out." No, some people have to say, "It proves that you don't love me." That becomes part of the so-called golf problem. Or somebody says, "I know why you go play golf, you play golf because you like to flirt with the women who work at the golf course." And no matter what the guy says she insists, "I know why you play golf, you like to flirt with the women at the golf course." That narrative becomes part of the golf problem. So we really want to help people identify what their narratives are about this issue and how these narratives might be contributing to the porn problem. And what we know about the way that narratives work in general is that in a lot of couples you can have a collaborative conversation about I'm unhappy about this or I'm unhappy about that until somebody starts telling the other person I know what this means to you, I know what you're thinking, I know what you're feeling, I know why you do what you do, I know why you don't want to do what I want you to do. And once people start bringing up those kinds of narratives, then the conversation becomes about those narratives rather about what's actually happening. And people can argue until the end of time, "No, I don't go to the golf course to flirt with the waitresses." "Yes, you do. "No, I don't." "Yes, you do." "No, I don't. And that's where the conversation gets stuck in rather than, "I feel lonely, I feel unimportant." Et cetera. So we really have to talk when there's conflict about pornography, we really have to talk to people about their narratives and keep stripping them away, stripping them away until we get down to how do people feel, what is their lived experience? We go to a cocktail party and I see other couples and they're all cuddly and they're all smiling knowingly and one of them is wearing like a little mini skirt and this and that, you know, and I feel like we don't do that anymore, we haven't done that in years, and I think partly it's because you're looking at porn and I wish you wouldn't look at porn because I'm in so much pain about how we don't cool at each other like those other couples do when we go to those faculty cocktail parties. So we want to strip away the narrative and get down to the feelings. We want to make sure that if somebody feels you looking at porn has no legitimacy that we, that we get that person to articulate that and to talk about that because once somebody decides that their partner's activity has no legitimacy, that's pretty much the end of the collaborative conversation. "You know, it's one thing to say I feel bad when you do X, It's another thing to say there is no room in this house for anybody to do X." That's the end of the collaborative conversation. So we have to dial people back to what I hear you saying is that you really don't like it when he does that or when you become conscious of this or when you think about it, you really don't like that, can you say a bit more about what it is that you don't like about that and let's get refocused on people's lived experience not their stories about their experience or their partners experience. And I'm sympathetic as the day as long about the pain that people are in about the narratives that they construct. And I can still while I'm being sympathetic about that hold people responsible for the narratives that they have. Everybody is responsible for the narratives that they create about whatever is going on. You know if somebody feels that they know the meaning of their partner looking at pornography, they're responsible for making that decision for themselves. And that's not to say they were not sympathetic but, you know, people who say I can't help how I feel, actually that's not accurate. We're in business to help people realize that they can help how they feel. Particularly of how they feel as a result of stories that they're telling themselves, that are optional, that are optional. Porn is not responsible for people feeling insecure about their bodies. Porn is not responsible for people feeling upset that they look the way that they do. Here's what's true, I've been a sex therapist for a long time. Even before porn what was true is that a lot of people when they're 49-years-old, they say, "Well, you know, I don't feel so sexy and my body, you know…" You know you're not going to wake up tomorrow with the body of a 25-year-old unless you're 25. You know if you're 49, you have to figure out a way to feel sexually attractive and that's true for men as well as women, thank you very much. Everybody has to figure out how they can think of themselves as sexually eligible when they no longer look like they're 22-years-old. I've lived in the same house for 31 years and I live two blocks away from a high school and when I moved into that house I wasn't young, but I was younger. And I would pull up at a red light and some of the kids when they were crossing in front of the car, you know, they would look into the car and they would kind of shrug and you know they keep going, now I'm 67-years-old and people walk in front, your kids walk in front of the car they don't even look in the car and I feel like saying, "Hey, don't you not look at me. You know, I forgotten more about sex than you'll ever know, don't you know look at me." Everybody has to figure out what to do about that. And people have been in pain about that since the beginning of time. The mass media of course makes it more difficult for people by showing us all these models of young and attractive people who are supposedly happier than we are, like the Kardashian's, you know. But even if you didn't own a computer, if you didn't own a TV, if you never went to a movie, if you never saw the cover of a magazine, all you have to do is go to the airport tomorrow and when you go to the airport tomorrow, you're going to see among all the people in the airport some people who are young and conventionally attractive, almost every single one of us is going to see somebody at the airport who is younger than we are, someone whose body is more conventionally attractive than ours and Porn didn't invent that problem. Men do not need pornography to notice that their partner who 20-years-ago, their breasts were up here and now their breasts are over here. Men do not need pornography to notice that. And the lack of pornography does not guarantee that men will develop the emotional skills to deal with that. Taking away pornography does not help. In the project of coming to terms with the way our bodies change and the way our partner's bodies change. When I got married, I married a very attractive younger woman, I now, am married to a woman who I love God bless her, who is the age of my mother used to be. How did that happen? Wait, wait, wait, bring back that young girl. My wife says to see me, "You know, when you go to LA to that couples conference, if you see that young guy with dark hair I used to be married to bring him back with you." I told her if I did, I would. So porn is a convenient target for people who have these important feelings that need to be discussed. "I don't feel very sexual, I don't feel attractive. You have low desire for me. I'm in pain about that." Let's talk about that in therapy which is painful for the therapist. Let's not get distracted by talking about pornography because talking about pornography will not address people's pain about you have low desire for me, you have not grabbed my butt in five years. That's a legitimate thing to be in pain about. Let's talk about that. When was the last time your partner grabbed your butt? Five years ago, is that about right, Herman? Grab her butt about five years ago? Longer than five years… How do you feel about that? How do you feel about that? How do you imagine she feels about that? And I'm not urging you to grab her butt but, but, apparently there's been some changes in this couple and it sounds like you're conversation hasn't kept up with those changes and that's not so unusual, is it? Happens all the time about a variety of things that couples don't talk about, the developmental changes that they go through, they may make jokes about it. They may talk about a very obliquely. You know, now that, now that I and my wife are 67, you know, people in the news they die, they're younger than we are or they're like a week older than we are, like David Bowie, I mean, what's up with that? David Bowie dies. "Honey, you know, I think it's a possibility that one of us is going to die." We better talk about this." We better talk about this. So here are some common myths about porn I just want to put them out there because you'll hear about these in session. The idea that the porn industry promotes child porn, that's just silly, they're making more money than they can count manufacturing a legal product. They all know that if they if they manufacture child porn they're not only will they go to jail they will be systematically raped every single day because even mass murderers look down on child pornographers in jail. The idea that actresses are trafficked or abused, that's not true. If you go down to and see, if you go down to the heart of the porn industry, there's a line around the block of women who are begging to be let into the porn industry. They don't have the traffic anybody. There are so many people who want to act in porn films. This idea that reducing porn watching leads to higher desire for the porn, I mention this I think yesterday, that's the eat less ice cream so you'll eat more broccoli theory. And it just doesn't work. It just doesn't work. I mean the idea that let's take away masturbating to porn from this guy and eventually he'll be like so crazy with lust that he'll settle for having sex with his wife. That's terrible. That's a terrible idea. It's a terrible idea. We've already talked about this mostly pornography is happy people, portraying happy people doing what most of us want to do, it also shows a little bit of troubling stuff fortunately not that much and the troubling stuff, it's troubling in the sense that we look at them and we say, "Jeez, who could have an erection looking at that?" But it turns out, it turns out that we're so polymorphously perverse that people, some people can get erect you know even looking at that and other people they can get excited even looking at that. So fortunately, fortunately the majority of people who look at really troubling stuff, it just sort of watches over them and, you know, they don't race out and, and, and commit anti-social acts. In my book I talk about the studies of Neil Malamuth, Mark Huppin, umm… has coauthored some of that stuff and there are studies that with a certain very, very, very specific configuration of personality dynamics what, what some people call the dark triad of psychopathy and Machiavellianism and a very particular configuration that involves a lot of impulsivity and all of that, if those people with that complete unusual psychological configuration, if they look at violent porn, they're more likely than the average person to commit anti-social acts. Fortunately the people with that personality configuration, it's a very small number of people. And, you know, it is troubling that, that those people committing anti-social acts, they commit antisocial acts without looking at violent porn too by the way. It's not like they only commit anti-social acts when they look at violent porn. Let's remember that when people are looking at images of rough sex what they're looking at is acting, let's remember that. It's not like someone is walking down the street and gets dragged onto a porn set where she's brutalized. I mean that's just naive to think that that would actually happen. What it is, is people are getting paid. People are getting paid to act out rough sex and by the way there's plenty of perfectly psychologically healthy people who like rough sex in real life and not everybody has to. But what we're seeing when we look at these images in pornography is we're looking at adults who are pretending to have rough sex or pretending that the rough sex that they're having is unpredictable. Pretending that the rough sex that they're having is more upsetting than it actually is, that's why it's called acting, it's called acting. Well, don't look at me. You're the one who told them to make themselves at home. Interesting question. Interesting question, are these people having sex or not? You know, that's time, you know, for another seminar but it is an interesting question, are these people having sex? What we know is that it's consensual, right? Even though it looks pretty rough, we know it's consensual. Let's talk about power struggles a little bit because power struggles is the way that couples frequently relate to pornography. We've talked about masturbation, is porn a form of infidelity? Infidelity is simply a contract violation, that's the definition of infidelity, it's a contract violation. Now I have a lease downtown in Palo Alto where I work, I work in Silicon Valley. I have a little office where I see patients and I have a lease to rent that office and the lease is eight pages long. It is eight pages long. Here are my obligations. Here my privileges. Here's the landlady's obligation, here's what, you know, she gets to say I can and cannot do. There's even a page at the end that defines different terms like what is a pet, is a turtle a pet? Is a goldfish a pet? Is a polar bear a pet? And if you have a polar bear and a goldfish what happens? So when most people couple up, their contract is not eight pages long, their contract is generally two sentences long. "You want to get together?" "Great." That's usually the couples contract. "Maybe you want to have kids?" "Yeah." "Great." But what happens you know if my mother becomes demented and I want her to live with me and you don't, what about that? What about if my job takes me to New York are you going to come with me? What if I, What if I become Catholic, what about that? So you know most couples contracts. Now one thing that some people say is so we agree that we won't mess around, right? Great. Except mess around is a little vague. Does that include slow dancing with somebody? What about slow dancing with somebody who gets an erection? What about slow dancing with somebody gets an erection and a wet spot on their trousers? Is that infidelity? Is that messing around? What about, "My ex-boyfriend contacted me on Facebook and since I was going to be in LA anyway I thought well a cup of coffee couldn't hurt? Oh, I didn't bother to tell you, I didn't think you'd be interested. I didn't bother to tell you because I thought you might get upset." Is that infidelity? So I was looking at porn in a form of infidelity. I don't vote on this question. I don't get a vote. If it's a one-one tie, I'm not the speaker of the house, I don't get a vote. I'm not the vice president, I don't get a vote. The good news is that we don't have to come to an agreement on whether or not it's infidelity. What we can agree on is that when this person says that they're upset that this person uses porn, we could all agree that this person is upset. We don't have to decide if it's infidelity. We could all agree that this person is upset. Now if this person says, "This is infidelity." And the other person says, "No, it's not." "Yes, it is." "No, it's not." "Yes, it is." They can argue until the end of time about whether or not it's infidelity and never get close to the important issues. So the issue is not is this infidelity, the issue is you feel upset about, "Jee, Joe, do you know that she's upset about it?" "Yeah." "Great, do you care? "Well, I'm not going to say its infidelity 'cause it's not." "Okay, let's leave that question aside, Joe. It seems as if Mary is pretty upset about this, do you notice that?" "Yeah, I notice that." "Well, you know, could we please talk about that?" "Well, as long as we don't have to say that it's infidelity." "Okay, okay. Infidelity is just a label right? But what's really important here is that you want to do something that she's really upset about. Do you know exactly what she's upset about?" "Oh, I don't know. Yeah, she's upset, you know, women, porn, whatever." I said, "Well, let me get this straight. How long have you two been arguing about this?" "Aha, couple years. Yeah, ever since she found out." "Listen, Joe. You you've been fighting about this for two years and you're not exactly sure how exactly how she feels? What are you been arguing about for two years if you don't know exactly how she feels?" "Or what, I'm supposed to like sit down and like ask her a million questions and find out exactly how she feels?" "That's one good way. I don't know a better way. Joe, if you don't know exactly how she feels when she's upset, like what exactly are you arguing about and what do you suppose she's thinking if you, if you don't know exactly what she's upset about?" "Oh, I don't know. You know, women they're different from men." "Well, actually, I don't know about that, but let's talk about her and you. How do you suppose she's going to feel if you say 'Ah, she's upset about something that I do, I don't know whatever…' How does far she's going to feel about that?" "I don't know." "Well, you think about it." I'll sit here quietly and think about what I'm going to have for dinner, if the session is ever over. "Well, Joe, what you decide?" "I don't know." "All right, you think about it. "Alright, alright, alright, I'll come up with an answer." I think I think being quiet sometimes is a powerful intervention, it's very, it's very socially, very rude, you know, to be quiet when it's your turn to talk, very rude. But I think it's a powerful tool in therapy when we say to, when a patient says I don't know and we say, "Well, you know, think about it for a second, I'll wait here." They really think that we're gonna, we're gonna be the first one to start talking. It's not going to be me. You need to think about this. You need to think about this. I like the word polysemicity which you don't hear in general, general conversation. It's very simple policy meaning, poly meaning many and semicity having to do with meaning, it's a fancy word for the simple principle that the same exact thing can mean two different things to two different people. So for example if you hear that Mary who you haven't seen in two years and you say, "Hey, Mary, I haven't seen in two years, what's up?" She says, "Well, I'm now a stripper." You say, "Ha" Now some people would say, "Jeez, if I were a stripper that would mean I had absolute rock bottom." Other people would say, "Well, if were a stripper what that would mean is I had finally, you know, taken ownership of my sexuality and taken charge of my life and gone out there and found a way to make a lot of money and take that money and go to college." So the same activity being a stripper could have two completely different meanings to two different people. And the mistake that every single one of us makes in ordinary life is that we figure, we figure that what people do means to them what it would mean to us if we were doing it. So it's true, let's just say, I mean nobody's lately asked me to be a stripper but, but you know for me to agree to be a stripper it would mean I have lost a lot of my other options, let's just put it that way. So you know when I, when I look at a patient who tells me that she is or is thinking about being a stripper, I have to like be really careful and put my own ideas about what that would mean to me aside and find out what it means to her. It might mean, "I'm finally done with my ex-husband." You know or my ex-wife for that matter. So when it comes to pornography, I mean, I had a, I had a couple about a year ago where she said if he looks at porn it means that he's interested in sex without commitment and I find that repulsive. And I said, "I totally believe you. I totally believe if that's what you tell me that for you sex without emotional commitment is repulsive." Apparently your partner doesn't feel exactly the same way. 

01:21:30
[sil.] 

01:21:40
MARTY KLEIN Well, we already talked about these things, isn't that handy? Isn't that handy? So when people say, "I don't want you looking at porn because if you look at porn, why should you think about me when we have sex if you could be thinking about porn?" Now that's a theory. That's a theory. So I want to know about real life. What I want to know is, well, when you have sex together what does he do that you don't like? Now if the answer is, "He calls me by the wrong name and he doesn't look at me, and he doesn't kiss me, and he seems like he's a million miles away when I look at his face." Those are legitimate behavioral complaints and then the question is I wonder what accounts for that behavior, did you know that you're doing those behaviors? If you do know, do you know how your partner feels about those behaviors? And so on. But let's not assume that your theory that it's the porn that your theory is what accounts for that behavior which you don't like. So let's talk about that behavior. "Honey, I don't like it when we have sex and you call me by the wrong name." "Honey, when we have sex together you never look at me, why is that? "Oh, gee I thought you got embarrassed when I looked at you during sex. I would love to look at you during sex." Okay, well, gee, honey, you seem like you're a million miles away when we're having sex, I hate that." "Well, honey to tell you the truth I'm trying, I'm thinking about baseball scores because I'm trying not to not come too fast." "Oh, well, you know, honey, I appreciate the effort, you know, about you not coming too fast but to tell you the truth you'd be in a million miles away think about baseball scores is worse then you coming too soon." "So if that's a choice I have to make, quit thinking about baseball you'll come real fast, I'll deal with it, but please don't be a million miles away when we have sex together." So what I want to know is, what is the behavior that people are complaining about? Behavior. Not some theory about why it's bad for your partner? But doesn't porn do all these difficult things and the answer is that's not a relevant consideration in couples counseling. Now somebody says, "You know, men look at porn and they start to look at women as objects and that's terrible." And I say, "Well, do you feel that that's what George is doing with you? And if the answer is yes, we don't have to talk about porn, we could talk about, "You know, George, I don't like the way that you look at me lately." Or whatever it is. And maybe changing George's porn habit will be a great way to address this. Maybe not, I don't know, but first we have to talk about what problem are we trying to solve? I want you to stop looking at porn as a solution. What is the problem that that solution is designed to address? And we see this in couples counseling all the time. Somebody comes up with a bright idea, "You should stop drinking." Or, "You should come home early." Or, "We should have date night." Or we should do this or we should do that. And the other person says, "I don't want to do that." And then they argue about whether or not they're going to, they're going to do this thing rather than talking about what is this thing designed to accomplish 'cause these people might easily be able to agree on, "It's true the last three times we went to one of your work parties I behaved pretty badly and embarrasses you and I don't like that either and we need to do something about that, what do you think we should do about that?" "Oh, your idea is that I should quit drinking altogether?" "I don't like that solution. Let's see what other solutions we might come up with." That's a great conversation. But if somebody just walks in and says, "You got to stop drinking." The other person says, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what, what, what? I don't want to." "Well, you should." "I don't want to." "Well, you should." "I don't want to." So telling somebody I don't want you to watch porn anymore, that's a solution to a problem, what's the problem that that is attempting to address? We've already talked about wheel, if you don't like it you can always use it as another example of how I have no idea who you really are. So maybe not the best cartoon for late in the day, I don't know. I don't know, oh, porn addiction. I have seven minutes to talk about porn addiction. Seven minutes to talk about porn addiction. The bottom line on porn addiction is it all depends on how you define addiction. If you define addiction as making the same decision over and over again despite repeated negative consequences, then just about every human being who has ever lived is addicted to something because the human condition is to do the same darn stuff over and over again, regret the consequences and do it again the next day. 

01:26:20
[sil.] 

01:26:25
MARTY KLEIN And we have a really good technology for dealing with that, it's called therapy. I reject the definition of addiction that it's doing the same thing over and over again despite negative consequences because that completely. That completely dismantles the meaning, the usefulness of addiction. Addiction used to be a really valuable concept, a clinically useful concept. Once you expand addiction enough so that it covers practically everything, it's not a very helpful concept any more. 

01:27:00
[sil.] 

01:27:05
MARTY KLEIN Now let me skip over to, to the junk science. This is the self test for pornography addiction. I beg you to go online and take the test for sex addiction and while you're there take the test for pornography addiction, it's very important that therapists know what is being marketed as porn addiction or sex addiction and what is being marketed is if you grew up or if you currently live in a sex negative culture, you will score very high on the sex addiction test. Look at these sample questions. No one knows I use my computer for sexual purposes? That's roughly everybody. I sometimes use cyber sex as a reward after a stressful day? I use the Internet to experiment with sexuality such as homosexuality. These are the kinds of questions that any reasonable person would say, "Well, yeah, what's your point." But the sex addiction people and the porn addiction people have this bizarre configuration of what normal healthy sexuality is supposed to be and it is completely stripped down and vanilla and completely skips over the fact that normal healthy people have an enormously wide range of fantasies and curiosities, lots of things they would never do in real life and so on. So if you feel guilt or shame or secrecy, supposedly those a diagnostic criteria for sex addiction a porn addiction and I reject that, that's just incredibly naïve. So I want to talk, so here are two studies one from 2013 in the Archives of Sexual Behavior, one from 2014, that it was as clear as a graph could possibly be that if you compare people who self identify as porn addicts and people who do not self identify as porn addicts, and you hold the amount of porn that they look at constant, the people who identify as religious have more self identification as porn addicts than the people who don't identify as religious, two different studies by different people. So let me talk about the junk science behind this, behind this idea of porn addiction. And I'm sorry I don't have a couple hours so I'll do this real quickly. 

01:29:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

01:29:30
MARTY KLEIN Oh, does it really? Oh, God bless you. Oh, buckle up folks. Is our right? Oh, my God, let me take a deep breath. 

01:29:50
[sil.] 

01:29:55
MARTY KLEIN Two Jews walk into a bar. All right, so let's talk about do (inaudible) for a second. I'm told by people who know about these things, I'm actually told by people who don't know about these things that the brain lights up when people look at porn, yeah. And the brain lights up when people look at porn in exactly the same way that the brain lights up when they use heroin, yeah. And they come to the bizarre conclusion that that means that looking at porn is just like using heroin, but they leave out this tiny little other fact which is that the way that the brain lights up when you use porn which is the same way that the brain lights up when you use heroin is the exact same way that the brain lights up when you cuddle your grandchildren. Yes, really. The brain is a machine that registers stimulation and pleasure. I'm worried about people who use porn and their brain does not light up. What are they doing? Are they doing a research study, what are they doing? It's completely disingenuous. It's completely disingenuous to compare. You know, the brain does this when you look at porn and the brain does this when you do these other things because the brain lights up when ever we're registering stimulation, uh… particularly pleasure. That's the way the brain is, good thing too. Good thing too. How many people here know how to read an MRI? Raise your hand real high. Oh, nobody. One person, okay. So we could say almost nobody, right? And yeah, and yeah, we read articles or we hear, even worse, we hear that MRI studies say such and such. And it's interesting the way that our field in the last seven, eight, nine years has been completely captured by this alleged evidence that none of us can actually see. You know, I can read a graph that says ten pebbles is bigger than three pebbles. I can read a graph that says left handed people move pebbles more effectively then right handed people move pebbles, I can see that. I can see that evidence. I know how to read that study. The overwhelming majority of MFTs could not read an MRI for a lives depended on it. And yet, and yet, people are being swept up with people claiming, here's this MRI, this FMRI, that says the following about people and we aren't, we are not in any position to evaluate that data. I think we ought to be in a position to evaluate that data and until we are, I'm curious, I'm intrigued about why our field is getting swept away by this invisible evidence. These FMRIs that none of us can read. Now we're not stupid, we could be taught how to see evidence. We could be taught, this morning Stan showed us pictures of the brain, some of us understood that, if it wasn't so early in the morning be a lot clearer I think. The FMRI studies that are being done, what most people don't know is that the (N) on the average FMRI study is about 15, 15 people. And more than half of the FMRI studies are done on animals not people. So maybe we have some information on how much rats like pornography but how relevant that is to the way that people relate to pornography I don't know. So we're hearing about this neuroscience, we're hearing about the way that people are being affected by this high powered stimulus as if it's happening in a vacuum and as if what's happening with the rest of our digital lives has no consequence whatsoever. And the truth is that studying, the brain effects of pornography without studying the brain effects of smart phones, and social media, and the fact that people don't date anymore, and the fact that our whole lives are now being lived in mediated ways rather than face to face ways. Studying porn without studying all that other stuff is completely disingenuous. We have to, we have to see the use of pornography in the context of all these other massive historical changes in the way that people relate to things. More than you do I see young men from Stanford who can't get interaction with a real woman and they use pornography every single day. I see that every week that I'm in the office. I've seen for years, every week that I'm in the office. 

01:35:10
[sil.] 

01:35:15
MARTY KLEIN Now I say to these guys tell me about the rest of your life or tell me about how you meet women with whom you don't have erections, right? Or tell me about what sexual experience you do have. I had a guy in my office the other day, I'm not making this up was, it was more than the other day, it's about, well, it was Christmas time, so about three four months ago. I had a guy in my office and he said that he was concerned about his erections when he was with a woman, yeah, and what could we do about that? Okay. And I asked him about his, you know, sexual relationships or sex life or… He said that, this guy's 22-years-old, he had had oral sex with 30 women. Thirty women which, you know, for people my age is like nine lifetimes, right? So this 22-year-old young man had gotten blowjobs from 30 women and had never had intercourse. Welcome to 2017. So he had had oral sex with 30 women, he had never had intercourse and this guy, and this guy, so I said to him, "How did you like those 30?" I said, "How many, with how many of these women did you have sex more than once?" And he said not one single one. And I said, "Why?" And he said, "What do you mean?" And I said, "Well, did you enjoy your time?" And he said, "Well, some more than others but yeah for the most part." I said, "Well, why wouldn't you want to contact that person and say let's do it again next week?" He said, "Oh, that's not the way it is." That's not the way it is. That's not the way that he or his generation are relating to sexuality. Because how does he meet these women in the first place? Half of the women he meets by going like this, right? And the other half of the women that he meets is he goes to a party where people are hanging out and then somebody goes off into that room and they have sex over there and somebody goes into that when they have sex over there and they're too drunk to remember what happened anyway. You can't blame this dramatic historical change on pornography because it happens in the context of the historical change where everybody is doing this where this guy and everybody in his generation in order to actually meet somebody they don't have to say, hello, this is my name, what's your name? And learn how to read somebody's face and learn that before you actually get a blow job, maybe you touch somebody on the shoulder, maybe you find out whether they're right handed are left handed, it's just selecting out pornography from the rest of the massive historical changes of digital life, it just doesn't make any sense. 

01:38:00
UNKNOWN Doesn't seem to. You don't have to do any of those things. Or it makes it easy. 

01:38:05
MARTY KLEIN No, no, that's not accurate. They don't have to do any of these things because of digital life. It's not because of only about pornography, it's about Twitter, and it's about the computer that you have in your pocket. I'll give you a perfect example. I had, I had dinner with Stan Atkins. That was lunch, I had lunch a Stan today and Stan's a big movie buff and I'm a big movie buff. So we were talking about a movie that a lot of people haven't necessarily seen it's called The Stunt Man, anybody ever seen that movie? Phenomenal movie. Phenomenal movie, starring Peter O'Toole and the director, and who, so we were talking about what was the name and Pete doesn't know anything about movies, if it doesn't have an explosion, Pete Peterson does not care about the movie. So Pete's just watching me and Stan talk about movies, and we were talking about who the director must have been? We knew that the star was Peter O'Toole and Steve Railsback was in that movie and who is the, and so before I could go through with Stan, "Well, was that this guy? Was that this guy? Was that this woman?" He whips out his phone and he looks it up and he says it was it was Bobby Rush and we looked at each other and said, "Okay." Well that's the end of that conversation. The fun is over and Stan and I, Stan and I, I love Stan and he loves me. Stan and I didn't get to investigate this issue together. The investigation got completely demolished the second he took out his phone and we didn't, and we went on to other fun things, you know, you don't have to feel sorry for me. But the way that people are living, the way the people living today and we're part of the problem of course, I mean we're, you know, normal people too. The way that people are living today, so much of our lives are mediated, I actually get text messages that say, "Please call me." What is that, what is that "Please call me." So… so well, let me answer this lady's question, okay, before I go on to more question unless you say "I have till six o'clock." 

01:40:15
[sil.] 

01:40:25
MARTY KLEIN Sure. Sure. Sherry… Sherry Turkle is work T-U-R-K-L-E, Sherry, talks about this and it's really important because Sherry talks about shame writing about technology. 

01:40:40
UNKNOWN Great. 

01:40:40
MARTY KLEIN Excuse me. We got it. We got it. 

01:40:40
UNKNOWN One of the… 

01:40:40
MARTY KLEIN Excuse me. Excuse me. We got it. So… so Sherry has talked for 25 years, she's at MIT. Sherry has talked for 25 years about the interface between technology and the way we think in the way we feel and the reason you can't lay off everything on pornography is because pornography is just a subset of the completely dysfunctional way that people are learning how to be with each other. In the old days, you know, up until about 600 years ago, if you wanted to kill somebody you had to get this close to them and you had to actually… I'm serious, up until about 1400 you had to be this close in order to kill somebody. You had to be able to see their face. You had to be able to smell them if you wanted to kill them. With the invention of artillery and sooner or later aerial bombardment we know how that works now you can kill people without realizing that there are people, you can kill people now without thinking that there are people. And the same thing is happening with social media not to… not to be histrionic about it but with social media what's happening is that and with digital life is that people need to understand less and less and less about human beings in order to interact with human beings and that's a problem in our field is not talking about that enough. So let me please continue. Let me please continue. Oh, thank you. Okay. So… so this young man… Thank you, so this young man with the 30 blowjobs. It sounds like a Truffaut film, doesn't it? Umm… This young man who had never had intercourse and had oral sex with three women and he… he never actually connected with any of these 30 human beings and they never actually connected with him and they all 31 of them think that that's perfectly normal, think that that's perfectly normal and he came in to me. And we were talking about these things and he said and after a while he said to me… Now here's your point but he said to me, "Tell me, Doc. People don't watch porn when they have… when they have real sex." Real sex is intercourse, you know, "Tell me, Doc, people don't… don't watch porn when they have real sex. Do they?" I said, "Generally not." I said, "You mean intercourse?" He said, "Yeah." "Generally not." He said, and I'm not making this up and you will think this makes your point actually. He said, "So what keeps you hard when you're having real sex with a woman if you're not watching porn?" Wow! And I submit to you that that is not a porn question, that is a question about the loss of real life, face to face, human connection that this guy doesn't realize that what creates an erection, what creates sexual feelings in your body is actually the five senses and I've been talking about this with people since 1980. How do you have better sex? By focusing more on your five senses. Back in the 1980s, sex, the best sex therapist in the world, Bernie Zilbergeld, Lonnie Barbach, the best sex therapist in the world were saying, if you have trouble having an orgasm you should fantasize, and this is before the internet, you should fantasize, you can look it up that Bernie and Lonnie were saying that "You should fantasize" uh… Bill (inaudible), it was same as a lot of people are saying "You should fantasize if you want to have more reliable orgasms." You know, I… I don't say that whether I said it back then or not is a secret but I don't say that now. I certainly don't say that now. I say, in fact, you need to go in the opposite direction rather than fantasize more, you need to fantasize less. Pornography doesn't make people fantasize. People can fantasize… I mean as long as Scarlett Johannson is alive we're not going to be porn, right? Or George Clooney or Claudette Cole (inaudible), you know, fill in whoever you like. So I think we make a mistake if we select out pornography from the massive change in human dynamics that have taken place in only the last 17 years and I think partly in a… in a 100 years in 500 years in a 1,000 years, people are gonna look back and they're gonna talk about this era as one of tremendous social change. We can see it because we're in it. We… we have trouble realizing, we're in the middle of history. Here we are in the middle of one of the most massive dislocations of human consciousness in history. This is a big deal. This is a really big deal. So… so I don't think it's porn addiction because I don't think for the most part, I don't think that people's ability to choose around pornography is taken away from them, the way that it is with say opiate addiction or alcohol addiction. The thing with opiate addiction for example which is real addiction is that people's ability to make autonomous choices is dreadfully compromise on a physical level, that's not what happens with pornography and if you've ever had the hellish experience of being with somebody when they're going off of opiates, I mean it is hell on earth. They vomit. They hallucinate. They shake. They can't sleep. It's horrible to watch somebody who's an opiate addict and you take away the opiate. If you take away pornography from someone who is supposedly a pornography addict, you know, you see they get crabby. Big difference, big difference, big difference. And the programs that supposedly treat porn addiction, they don't say, "You go masturbate without porn, and that's okay, and report back later." They take away both they take away both the masturbation and the pornography. Now you can take away pornography from people and they'll manage, but you take away masturbation from somebody who's used to masturbating every night and they get really crabby. I would be a lot more sympathetic to the idea of masturbation addiction which I don't think exists, but at least that makes more sense than pornography addiction. So I rarely see a patient whose ability to make decisions around pornography is completely compromised. I see people making bad decisions about pornography all the time. And I… I have the special way of treating them. I use therapy. Uh… But the idea that… that people can't be held accountable or can't control their porn watching, I think says a lot more about us and our discomfort with pornography and masturbation, says a lot more about our discomfort with why would somebody choose to do that, then it does about the patients. Every once in a while I see someone umm… who uh… they start watching at 11 PM and at 4 AM. They sort of come out of their trance and that person has a very serious problem. I wouldn't call it an addiction. I would treat it like an addiction I would do therapy with that person. Now some of these people they have diagnosable mental conditions. Some of these people who look a way too much porn, they umm… they have a bipolar disorder, where is my list, where is my list, I don't have any list. They have bipolar disorder. They umm… they have insomnia already. They may be alcoholics… I'm sorry. Oh, absolutely. They may… they may have OCD. I mean people who are using anything in self destructive ways, we shouldn't look at the thing before we look at the dynamic, I mean we should look at how comes it that this person is using this substance to medicate themselves, medicate their anxiety, medicate their loneliness, medicate their sadness. And they be… they may be really attached to this way of medicating themselves, but that doesn't mean that they're addicted. It means that, right now they don't have a lot of other ways to make themselves feel better. Calling it addiction, limits our ability, it limits our tool kit to help them. So umm… if it's not porn addiction what is it. It's either a diagnosable mental condition or it's repetitive really bad decision making or it's something that the partner doesn't like. And we already know how to treat those things. Sometimes we use medication but we already know how to treat repetitive bad decision making. And we certainly know how to treat OCD or bipolar disorder or… or personality disorders or something like that. So what you want to do is umm… you want to find out, if… does the content of this thing is the fact that it's pornography does it have meaning? Maybe it does, usually not, but sometimes it does. Uh… I want… I want to know the ecology of this. I want to know, are you mostly using pornography after a fight with your partner, are you mostly using pornography when your partner wants more closeness, are you mostly using pornography when you're having trouble at work, are you mostly using pornography when you haven't had enough sleep? The same way that we would… the same way that we would talk about a lot of other things. People who use too much pornography to self soothe, they need other ways to help self soothe, right? They need other ways. I think yoga is a great… is a great approach to what other people call sex addiction. I think yoga is a great idea. I think laying on the floor for five minutes when you get home from work is a great thing for people to do. Now I work in Silicon Valley where it's a scientific fact most people don't have a body. And… and I tell these people. I tell these people, "Do you have a banana in the house?" People say "Yeah." I say "I want you to unpeel banana but you've got to take at least… at least three minutes to unpeel that Banana." People said, "I can do them much faster." I said, "No, no, no. That's the whole point. That's the whole point." I… I want you to unpeel that banana one third of the way down and then I want you to smell the banana. People say "Bananas don't have a smell." I say, "Yes, they do." And… and the Browner the banana the more it smells. So get one that's, you know, not green. So teaching… teaching these people to tune into their body sensations, I think is a great way to… to help them find new ways to self sooth. Umm… And the willingness to communicate about sex is very important for these people, if they are using pornography to get around, the fact that they are unhappy with their partner sexually. We want to encourage them to talk with their partner about sex, then we better be willing to help them clean up the mess when they do. You know, you encourage people to talk to their partner about hard stuff sometimes they actually do it, right? You know, be careful what you ask for, right? Because you might get it. Umm… So we've already talked about competition. Uh… I think we're not talking to women enough about their body image issues when they are upset about their partner looking at porn. And I… I went into that a little while ago, umm… but I really want to underline this. I'm extremely sympathetic with anybody man, woman or anybody else who has trouble accepting their body. When people say, when people say "My partner looks at porn that makes me feel worse about my body." I say "Well, what are you gonna do about that. Now what is your partner gonna do about that. What are you gonna do about that?" It would be like saying "You know, my… my brother, you know, just got a PhD at Harvard, that makes me feel stupid." Well, you know, let's get his PhD taken away from him, so you don't have to feel so stupid. No, you feel stupid because your brother just got it… got accepted to Harvard Medical School. What are you going to do about the fact that you feel stupid? The point in… in that problem and… and this is the same thing. Umm… I can't compete with those women. You don't have to. You don't have to. You don't have to. You don't have to. And if your partner doesn't want you, it's not cost your partner looks at porn. Now how much easier would it be if we could say, you know, if a woman says "My partner doesn't want me." And… and I have two choices. The reason is because A, looks at porn or B, because it's me. Well, everybody would wanna think it's A, nobody want to think it's B. And so what people are doing is to reduce their own distress, they're deciding it's A. The reason you don't want to be with me is because you look at porn, if you didn't look at porn, you wouldn't mind being with me. That's a much more comforting explanation. Uh… Everybody has to come to terms with this question. So I want to end by talking about porn literacy. Umm… Because we… we do, in fact, live in a culture that's watching porn more than any culture in history and that does demand a certain kind of response from us culturally. And the answer is not let's get everybody to watch less porn, that is not gonna happen and it's attacking the problem in the wrong place anyway. What we need is porn literacy. If you go back… if you go back to the 1905, 1910, when cars were first invented, first put on the road, it was like chaos at there. I mean nobody knew. You didn't need a driver's license. Nobody knew how to drive. Nobody knew how cars work. And people, you know, cows in the road and people hitting cows, and what people need… And now here's an interesting thing. I was in China, umm… I've been to China three times. The first time I was in China it was just at the… How many people were in China like a while ago anybody? Yeah. So maybe you remember up until recently people in China didn't have private cars, so I was in China just when people were starting to get private cars. Now what we don't even realize, I mean everybody in America grows up in a home where somebody drives right or somebody has a car maybe more than one car, and if you don't… if your family doesn't have a car, your friends family has a car and everybody in America knows how cars, you know, look at how they work and how they smell. I was in China, right when… right when private cars started to be popular, and what that meant was everybody driving a car in China back then had grown up in a home where there were no cars. So everybody in China who was driving the car at that time in history had no idea what they were doing. Had no idea to stop to pick up hitchhikers or not, is it safe to drive in the rain? Chinese people are asking is it safe to drive in the rain. Now we don't ask that because we grew up in homes where when we were eight years old, you know, we went to car while it was raining so we know, it's okay. So in China, just recently, they had to come up with like car literacy. Do you throw trash out the window of your car and in China at the beginning every throwing trash out the window of the car, because nobody had grown up with cars. So our culture needs porn literacy. And the very most important part of foreign literacy is the question, "Is porn real?" And the answer is "No. It's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not." It's pretend. What other aspects of porn literacy do we need to look at? We need to remind people to check on are you using porn consumption as self medication and if you are that doesn't make you a bad person, let's talk about what it is you're trying to medicate, does your partner know just how bored you are with your job? Does your partner know how scared you are about losing your job? Does your partner know that you're trying to compete with guys who are younger than you are and you don't think you're going to survive?

MARTY KLEIN Why do you watch porn anyway? Why do you personally, not why do men look at porn? Why do you like what is it about that experience that you value, could we please talk about that? What is it that you see and I don't mean, you know, what color is the actresses hair? I mean what do you see what some people see and what some people love about porn is the depiction of abundance? In porn, there's enough of whatever you want. There's enough time. There's enough erections. There's enough privacy. If it's about privacy, there's enough people watching if it's not about privacy. So let's remember that porn is a content issue, do not treat porn as if it's this special thing that requires special uh… concepts, treat porn like any other content issue, which is to say get away from the content as soon as you can. And let's remember that porn does not have inherent meaning, it is not inherently woman hating, it is not inherently exploitive of this group or that group. Porn is just a bunch of images that some people really like to look at and the problem is that the way that some people use that is not good for them and the way that some couples are dealing with it is not good for the couple. So let's keep focused on that stuff which is at the end of the day what people want from therapy. People don't come to therapy to… to resolve particular conflict. People come to therapy because they want more enjoyable lives and that may involve you watching porn less, it may not involve touching the porn looking at all. Do not get pulled into the question of is porn good or bad? If you get pulled into that question you're inevitably siding with one person or the other. And remember we're not supposed to take sides, right? We're not supposed to take sides and when someone says that… that they're absolutely rigid, you know, some people say uh… if you look at porn, the marriage is over and some people say, "Well, you know, since it's porn, that's okay." You know, it's not like, well, you know, "If you continue to each… you're meeting, you know, well done, the marriage is over." We say "Well, gee, look at that rigidity." Now with porn, it's… it's the same thing. I mean if… if somebody takes the position that their partner's recreational habits are a deal breaker, we should talk about the existence of a deal breaker rather than the content of the deal breaker. It doesn't matter what the deal breaker is, it's the fact that there is a deal breaker. And PS that the deal breaker is about their private behavior, by the way. Umm… No one gets to read somebody else's mind. This should be old news to couples counselor, she know when someone says I know what you're thinking, actually no, you don't. You think, you know, what they're thinking, maybe you're right maybe you're wrong, but just because the subject is pornography, doesn't mean that somebody gets to say I know how it effects you, I know what you're thinking. And the most important thing for people remember about porn is that real sex does not feel like porn looks. And one of the issues with younger people who are seeing all this porn before they have their own sexual experiences is that they're expecting not those same activities, that's the wrong level to look at this on, it's not that people are expecting to do the same activities, they're expecting to feel the way that porn looks. And real sex doesn't feel like porn looks. Real… Porn is artificially constructed, but real sex doesn't feel like that. The best sex includes moments of boredom. The best sex includes moments of self-doubt. The best sex includes moments of uh… you leaning on my hair, hold it, hold it, hold it. So that's a real… that's real sex. And porn… porn doesn't… doesn't seem like that at all because it's an artificial creation. So if somebody is behaving badly on porn don't blame the porn. Umm… If somebody is thoughtless or hostile or if somebody is cold and they watch porn, don't blame the porn. You know, hold the person responsible for their own behavior and hold the person responsible for the way that they're managing their relationship. And that's what I came to tell you today. So thank you very much.
