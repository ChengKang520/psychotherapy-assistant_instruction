What brings Children into Therapy: A Developmental View Violet Oaklander, Ph.D. Violet.Oaklander@gmail.com 

00:00:00
ROXANNA ERICKSON KLEIN Welcome. Thank you for being her for this early morning, at eight a.m session. Uhm, it re-- it's really nice to see everyone here and it is my distinct privilege to introduce our speaker, Violet Oaklander. Uhm, I would also like to comment that we have some of her family members here in the audience, uhm, a couple of her grandchildren and her daughter and I think that that's-- if, if you don't mind standing up. Thank you. I think that, that in itself says something about the work and the values of Violet Oaklander. What I would like to say about her before she begins is that when she first started in psychotherapy, she was breaking in to a field that was male dominated and had all sorts of challenges, uhm, with bringing in new ideas in different place of doing therapy, and she stead fast, continued to focus her attention on treatment of the patient, treatment of the children. That's what she's going to talk about her today is developmental aspects, developmental considerations of children that come into therapy. But-- so when she, she started in the field, she faced a lot of challenges. She remained focus and today, many years later, her ideas have become accepted as state of the art as normal. So she, so she started from a position where she really had to struggle for, for her ideas to become known and to become accepted and now, you look around and it make so much sense and so obvious that we owe it extreme and of gratitude that she maintained her focus and maintained her energy to continue working in this direction. So... 

00:02:15
VIOLET OAKLANDER Thank you. Thank you, Roxanna. Nice, thank you. 

00:02:25
ROXANNA ERICKSON KLEIN Okay. 

00:02:25
VIOLET OAKLANDER I don't know what happen to my-- oh, there it is, okay. Okay, I'd mention to know that is, ah, ro-- Eric Erickson's daughter. 

00:02:40
ROXANNA ERICKSON KLEIN No, Milton Erickson. 

00:02:40

00:02:40
ROXANNA ERICKSON KLEIN That's all right. 

00:02:40
VIOLET OAKLANDER Milton Erickson's daughter, Roxanna. 

00:02:45
ROXANNA ERICKSON KLEIN Yeah, so, so I know what it is to be a family member and that's why I encourage the introduction. 

00:02:55
VIOLET OAKLANDER Thank you. Okay, can you all hear me away over there? Uhm, I really wanna thank you for getting up so early to be here at eight oc-- eight a.m. I-- somehow, I fantasize that they're like 20 people who are early risers. Anyway, ah, one of the things I'm supposed to do which I forgot to, how many of you are here yesterday for my workshop? Not everybody but a lot. Okay, I forgot to read the, uhm, educational (inaudible ) which we call, it's the objectives and so I'm gonna read today as objectives. Ah, let's see where are you? Okay, what they are, are you gonna-- after you finish this talk-- after I finish this talk, you will be able to describe the whole talk, you know. You'll be able-- three basic developmental aspects that can affect the child's development and you will be able to say what you will-- you'll know what organismic regulation is, and you will, ah, in therapeutic work, and you will be able to subscribe the healthy development of the infant prior to interruption. 

00:04:30
Development Issues Confluence vs. struggle for self: A dilemma The child enters the world getting her/his sense of self from mother: her voice, touch, face. The child struggles for individuation. 

00:04:30
VIOLET OAKLANDER Okay, so now you got it so I just have to change places here. All right, uhm, so what, what, what I'm going to talk about is, uhm, the ki-- the kinds of development, natural developmental issues that children go through as they grow up that interrupt sometimes healthy development. When we think of, of children who are disturbed or you know that, ah, often that it comes from kinds of trauma and which of course is true but there are some very basic, ah, levels of development that affect children in how they manage to go through these so it's kind of interesting to look at that. Uhm, so let's see, the first one that you have, is it up there? No, it's not, it's not up there. 

00:05:40
 It is. 

00:05:40
VIOLET OAKLANDER It is? I can't see. 

00:05:40
 Confluence. 

00:05:40
Development Issues Confluence vs. struggle for self: A dilemma The child enters the world getting her/his sense of self from mother: her voice, touch, face. The child struggles for individuation. 

00:05:45
VIOLET OAKLANDER Confluence, yeah. Okay, what, what is, what is confluence? It kind of a, it is like an echo so it's hard for me. It can-- it really-- does this come out okay? A confluence is a term that we sometimes use in the gestalt therapy, certainly not originated by gestalt therapy but it has to do when you get your sense of self from the other. You know, in two rivers come together and join, we say they're confluent. So in this case, baby that's born, the infant that's born is very confluent or some say confluent, ah, with the mother, usually the mother or the original caretaker of the baby. It could be father but usually is mother. And the baby gets her sense of self from the mother, how the mother, her voice, her gestures, how she holds her-- the baby and it gets her of who she is from that. But this is really a dilemma because the baby struggles right from the beginning to separate and become her-- his or her own person but it's a real dilemma because there's sense of self is so tied up with mother that it is a, a real kind of a struggle. You know, we talk about the struggle for independence in adolescence but are actually starts in, ah, early child-- in infancy. Ah, those of you who have children, you know this. I mean the baby really tries to establish the self but its-- but very difficult away from mother so that's one of the first things that, uhm, affect children and when we work with children who have very difficult time to bond with the other, it means that many times at that period of time was difficult for them that they weren't-- they didn't have the unnatural kind of feeling of bonding and separation and struggle for separation and bonding and back and forth, ah, with acceptance and good feeling. So, uhm, that would be the first one. 

00:08:15
Developmental Issues Egocentricity The child is cognitively and emotionally unable to understand separate experience. S/he blames the self and takes responsibility for trauma 

00:08:20
VIOLET OAKLANDER Second one, you know, I can't tell from here. Egocentricity, that goes on. Uhm, now all what that means? Egocentricity has a bad press, you know, if its egocentric, we say, "Oh, he's egocentric. All he thinks about is himself." Ah, but really the child naturally as egocentric and, ah, it's like they, they can't understand yet separate points of view that I could be tired and they and the child could be full of energy. If the child is, wants to go to the park and wants mother to take him to the park and he's full of energy. And mother is exhausted because she worked all day and, ah, it's hard for the child to understand. Ah, they're basically very egocentric and the difficulty with this besides the fact that it's hard for parents to, ah, they want the child to understand, they might even get angry and say, "See, I'm, I'm so tired. I worked all day." That's very difficult for the child to comprehend. A two or 3-year-old or even a 4-year-old took comprehend that so then, that sometimes the parent get angry at the child and so forth. But the big problem with egocentricity is that they take responsibility for everything that happens. It's like the whole world centers around them and they don't yet understand separate experience so if mother has a headache and father has a backache, they kinda think, it their fault. Ah, anything-- somebody dies, they secretly think they had something to do with it and, ah, this is a very common, uhm, attitude of children and, ah, very important for therapist to understand. I, I was working with a woman once who came in to therapy issues in her 40s. She came into therapy because she was having difficulty, ah, uhm, into mingling with other people, connecting and making contact with other people and she realize this and she wanted it to change and she was a very quiet and she have difficulty talking to others. And so, uhm, she had-- she had gotten a new job which she really had to make a lot connections and that was what prompted her to come into a therapy. So when-- what happen was that when we explore how long she'd been that way she said, well, she didn't think she was that way when she was very young because she remembers her mother and other is saying that she talk and, and was very friendly. So in exploring this sort of I had her kinda go back to when she was a little child to see what was going on, where-- when this might have stop. And she had a memory which she had forgotten and the memory was that when she was 4 years old, she was, ah, wrestling with her uncle on-- in the living room floor. They were wrestling, and giggling, and laughing, and, ah, he suddenly died of a heart attack. While they were wrestling, he made this awful noises and, and he died actually and she started screaming and her mother came running in and of course, it was his-- got her absolutely hysterical and, and if somebody called the paramedics and they carried him away. And this little girl-- and the woman still remembers that when the memory came back that when she was a little girl, she thought she had done something in the playing that made that happened. And that stayed with her all the years and in fact, when she was a chic, her mother-- when she would ask her mother what happened, what happened? Her mother would say, "Be quiet, be quiet. I'll talk to you later. Be quiet. Not, now." And so, she realize that she better not talk much because it really upset her mother. It might make her mother die, you know. So she went back-- and when inside herself. And when she was about 18 or 16, I don't know the age exactly, she became a nun and she took many of hours of silence because that was where she felt she needed to do and, ah, when she was about in her early 40s, she left the convent and, uhm, she became a teacher. She had been a teacher a little bit in the convent. She was fine with the children but she was a very, had a bit a lot of difficulty with adults. So when she have this memory, we had to spend a little bit of time helping her to help her, the little child understand that it wasn't her fault. But that's what egocentricity does, the child blames themselves for whatever is happening and it's important to be cognizant of that in your work, you know, if that had had some kind of trauma that the child blames the self. Let's see I forgot to check out my notes here. Just to make sure that I don't skip anything. Oh, I can't find my notes, okay. I could just read the whole thing but I know, I lose my place anyway. Okay, so, ah, before I go on to the next one, I wanna say something about what ha-- the healthy baby because it's one of the educational objectives. You know, how I began to-- how I began to look at this was to look how does the healthy baby grow and develop and, uhm, when you look at the baby, the first thing that happens is the baby is very sensuous and she has to eat to live, suck to live. She needs to be held to thrive. I mean there's lot of research of children, babies are not held. They do not thrive and, ah, they need-- they, they look as they grow, they look at everything. They listen to everything. They, ah, we know, they touch everything. They taste everything. They use their senses fully, fully, and, uhm, the next thing that begins to happen is the child becomes aware of his body. He looks at his hand and he explores his and then, he realized he can grab things and then, he realizes that he can drop things. In fact, the beginning that child drops things accidentally and it's like, oh, what did ha-- what happen here and so parent picks up, they start to cry. Parent picks up what they drop and gives it to the child who promptly drops it again because children have a way of doing something over and over until they develop mastery. And when they develop mastery then they've want to-- they go on to something else. This is the beauty of watching children develop and, ah, so they, they learn how to sit and then how to turn over and how to crawl and how to walk and how to run and they use their bodies fully and zestfully and then not inhibiting themselves yet. And this same thing is true for every other aspect of the organism. They use whatever they have fully and there comes a point, I mean, even expressing emotions. You know all babies express emotions all over the world but there-- it comes a learning to not express it. If you learn, I better not express my emotions. I can't be angry. Ah, my mother doesn't even like it when I cry and I as I get older, they begin to suppress those emotions for various reasons. Now, you know it for instance when a 2-year-old is happy or angry, or afraid, you know it. But as they get older, it becomes something you can't really, can't really tell yet. Uhm, I hope some of you will remember to go on the foundation, Erickson Foundation website, ah, for this conference and because there are handouts, you put-- you click on handouts and then you go down to say my name and you'll see a bunch of handout and there's one handout, it's called The Many Faces of Anger, uhm, plus which all these developmental aspects are there but the idea is that a child could be angry and you'd never know it. You think they're hyper or you think they're afraid or you think many things but you don't really know that what really is that they're angry and they don't know how to express it. Anyway, back to baby, so the baby, even the mind, the ma-- the young child learns things you can't even imagine how much the child learns. You know, we use to have a myth that, uhm, you can only learn for so long and then you start going downhill and they know now that, that even I can learn things now and even though I'm old, you know. So, uhm, it's wonderful to know that, you know, that you can make-- get your mind going constantly and children do that. They learn so much but then all of a sudden, something happens and it often happens when they starts school where they close down their minds and they look around and they start comparing themselves or they hear things that they, ah, sometimes children don't overtly hear you're dumb or you're stupid but they, they sense it by what's happening. You know, and, uhm, so they begin to close down their minds. Anyway, what, what happens? I mean, why does this happen? Because the child wants to adjust and live in the society that they live and they learn that, uhm, ah, that they can't-- they're not as good as the other persons so they begin to shut down. Anyway, uhm, ah, so I'll be able to look at my note. Okay, so is it many of the things that we are looking at begin at the very early age, certainly confluence, certainly egocentricity in early ages and, and sometimes we grow up and we carry this things with us unless we've worked on it. And the other thing that happens is that, uhm, wait. Okay, I want, I wanted to give you another example which I made a note and I, ah, of egocentricity in a, in a, in your work. So a 12-year-old boy is in therapy because his parents are so angry at each other that, that they go to court for custody of the child. They each think the other one is a terrible parent and the judge mandates therapy for the child because he sees this is a ridiculous situation. Now, this boy being 12, when I talked to him he said, "I don't care. It's their thing. It doesn't bother me. You know, I don't care." And, and which is a typical thing that a 12-year-old would do. Meanwhile, his grades are falling. He's not-- he's staying at home more. He doesn't wanna go out very much and he's becoming quiet. This is his way of dealing with this feelings and, uhm, so, you know, but you know, you know that something, how can a child live with both parents screaming at each other all of the time, fighting all of the time, all of the time and just be calm and stay with where they are and he never talks about it. As far as he's concern, everything is the same. Ah, he doesn't like it when his parents fight but that's their thing. Anyway, so he comes into the office, ah, ah, at second time actually and I, you know, it's hard to know where to go because I don't know. He's denying everything. He's not, you know, what we gonna deal with so I start to think, well, we, we better just do something projective. So I asked him what he'd like to do? Would he'd like to draw a picture or of some-- that I would tell him what to draw, or make a scene in the sand and he chose to make a scene in the sand. Now, I've had kids make scenes in the sand of their divorce and they'll put a lot of army man, they make a war in the sand. Ah, because they see it as a war but he didn't. What he did was he just took three figures, surfers, he like to surf. Now, this what cake decorations, you can buy wonderful sand tray miniatures as cake decoration so he put three surfers on the sand and he said, "I'm done." And I said, "Well, what do you have there?" And he said, "Well, they are surfing." Silence, you know, okay, so we have to have a dialogue so I say well, uhm, I wanted-- which one are you cuz I really wanna talk to him. So he looks, he said, "Okay, I'll be this one." And he points one and I said, "Well, what it's like? What's the water like? And what are the waves like?" And we chat a little bit about surfing and his figure answers me from his voice and, uhm, while he's talking, he knocks over-- his hand knocked over one of the figures so I said, "Oh, what happened to him?" And he cannot ride into the metaphor, the story, he said, "Well, he's gonna drown. The surfboard is gonna hit him in the head and he's gonna drown." And I said, "Well, what are you, ah,-- the other two guys do?" He said, "Well, this guys just surfs away," and he surfed the guy away. And I said, "What's-- what about you?" "Well," he said, "I could've help him but I didn't." And his voice began to drop which was a signal to me that he was closing down, clo-- making-- closing contact so I said, ah, "Before you, let's stop doing this but before we do, uhm, I just wanna ask you something. Do you ever feel like that? Does that ever happen in your life?" "Well, I like to surf," he said. I said, "I know but I was thinking that you, your figure felt responsible for his drowning and, and you could have helped him so I'm just wondering if you ever feel responsible for anything in your life." And he immediately begin to just cry and he said, "It's all my fault. Everything is my fault." Ah, about his parents and so, you know, it's kinda like a classic example of how kids take responsibility because he actually said, "It's my fault." And, ah, it's interesting to look at the-- that sand scene because, ah, it's like a dream. One figure is denying, ah, that anything is happening. The other figure is drowning which I think he was drowning and a part of him was denying and then, this third figure is dro-- is, uhm, saying, "I could have helped him but I didn't." You know, and so, he is the one that takes responsibility. So it was only after that, that we could begin to really address what was happening. I couldn't bring his parents in to the session because, ah, they were so angry that it was impossible and I, I don't mind anger but this was really toxic. So I worked with the child and it made a huge difference that he began to take some responsibility for how-- for his own life and, ah, anyway, that's just a little example of how could, ah, our so egocentric emotionally. Now Piaget wrote a lot about egocentricity and he would say that when you're about a seven or eight, you can begin to understand separate experience. But I have discovered that we always-- when it's in emotional thing that triggers us, we are all egocentric and this 12-year-old boy is certainly was and something happens just somebody-- we-- so we always say, "Is it my fault or what could I have done to make it better." We were-- we're always involved in what we, we make ourselves involve. It's a very difficult to separate from that kind of-- from something really big and emotional. Anyway, uhm, so that's egocentricity. Let's see where we gonna go next, introjects. 

00:27:10
Developmental Issues Introjects The child lacks the maturity and cognitive capacity to reject that which doesn't fit for her/him. S/he takes in negative messages and develops a faulty belief system of self. 

00:27:10
VIOLET OAKLANDER Now, what is an introject? An introject is a message that the child takes in, ah, because they don't have the maturity or the cognitive ability to say that doesn't fit for me, that's not me, they take everything and they believe everything overtly and covertly or in fantasy. They just believe everything so that, uhm, when they get these messages as young children, ah, they believe them. Now, I would, I can say that every single one of you, ah, as you are in today as an adult carries some introjects from when you were a child. And if-- and maybe you know about it or maybe, you've work it through but when something happens that triggers that old introject, it's right there and you still feel, oh, I can't do this. Ah, I'm not smart enough. I'm not-- I'm so this, I can't do that. Whatever it is you have that old message. So, uhm, that's something that-- it's very, ah, crucial in work with children because it's even if they have an experience, ah, a trauma that they take responsibility for, or blame themselves, or take in-- they take in message in, every child takes in a message about themselves and they ca-- they, they carry into adulthood. Uhm, and if you think for a minute, you probably can think of one. And if you think about something at all like about yourself, I guarantee that it will connect from something way back. It may not look obvious but if we work in-- if I work in with you, we'll find it. And of course that-- when yesterday, I just talk about the self nurturing work and that's where it becomes so crucial to look at that negative message and know that it's the the child really who feels that message and to deal with it. Okay, let's see. We go on here. I really better watch the clock, somebody is gonna, I don't wanna that. Okay, getting needs met. 

00:29:45
Developmental Issues Getting needs met The child will do anything to get his or her needs met, often adapting inappropriate ways of being in the world - a process of being - in order to avoid rejection and abandonment and to gain approval. This "process" involves the very behaviors and symptoms that bring the child into therapy. 

00:29:45
VIOLET OAKLANDER Now, the truth is that a child will do anything to get their need met. To get, you know, the what they need to live in life and sometimes, they misunderstand and they engage in inappropriate behavior thinking that that's how they'll get the needs meet. Like the woman I'd spoke to you, she thought that if she didn't-- if she was quiet and didn't make any noise that she, her mother would not abandon her. I mean that maybe a little exaggerating but, and her mother would feed her and love her and give her what she needed and that's what kids do. They make a determination about how they should be and, ah, to, to basically to get their needs met. And as they grow, of course, little children know they need their parents to get their needs met but as they grow, they begin to learn that they can met some of their own needs and that's why, ah, experiences with mastery, ah, so crucial. For children, when they are little, ah, and they feel more able to meet their own needs and they feel that sense of mastery, it really is wonderful as they grow. They begin to know they can take care themselves and work and, and when they're little, they know, they can't take-- get a job and earn money and take care of everything. But as they develop that feeling and it starts in the infancy where they learn how to drop and you keep give to them and they just drop until they know that they did it, you know. And, ah, I use-- used to tell this story but I don't know, about my grandson, Michael, ah, because it really fits. Is it okay if I tell the story? Ah, when he was an infant, his father send me a video and you probably don't even remember this, his father would take videos of him, because they live in Boston and I live in California, so I could see him. And, ah, he hand this video, it's right and he's got-- while he's about 4 months old, he's lying in his crib and he has a mobile with a ball at the end and he's very excited the mobile is going like this and he's very excited and one of his hand, hits the ball by mistake. You know, cuz he's just going like this, it goes like this and he stops and he look, he's 4 months old. I mean I know he's a genius because he's like grandmother but anyway, and then he wants it to move again but he doesn't know how. I think he wants it to move again and he gets kind of excited again, accidentally, he hits the ball. Well, by the fourth or fifth time, he is purposely going like this, purposely and hitting it purposely. It is the most amazing thing to see but that's what babies do. They develop mastery. They try it out for a while and they wanna learn something new. It's so subtle and it's-- there's no real language to it that you don't-- you can miss it. You can easily miss it. So, ah, I have another story that he-- I know he doesn't remember but it sort of a good example. We were, we were-- I know his mother doesn't remember. We were at a restaurant and, uhm, he had, ah, a cup of something. He must have been about 10 months old now. He had this cup and he had a straw and I was there actually. And he was drinking it through a straw whatever it was, juice and, ah, he couldn't get any more of the straw but there was still some of the liquid in the cup. So he took the cup and he look that in and he look that at and he bent it forward and he was able, you know, so that the liquid came where the straw could reach it and he drink the rest of it. Nobody paid any attention but maybe because I was just like astounded that he did that. I mean I, I don't know if that's takes a lot of analytical thinking, you know, and but one, you know, that's what children do all the time and so, we don't even really notice it much. And that's how they build mastery and the more mastery experiences that parents can give their children and a therapist can give a child while working with them, the stronger you begin to see them. You can almost see it in their bodies that sense of self descip-- that feeling that I can do this. So, uhm, that's, that's still part of working with getting needs meet. That helping them gradually learned to met their own needs. It takes patience. It-- you know, if you're in a hurry to get to work and you have to be at a conference at eight a.m. and you have your child to get dress them and you have to, you know, drive there, and all of that, it takes patience. It's hard to let your child tie his or her own shoes or whatever, get dress but if they can do these things themselves, they become stronger. And if the parents are always doing things like that for their children, they'd, they'd just become like, you know, puppets. They just don't do that, there's no strength there. So it's just good to know because when get kids on therapy and though we talk about how, ah, you know, some kids will work so hard to, to achieve and other kids will, uhm, just want you to do it. They can't do it, they can't do it. You know that that kid needs some mastery experiences and especially, the kids who ha-- or want-- ah, the kids who want a lot of stuff and, ah, you'll give them the stuff and then they play with it and then two seconds later, they're tired of it. These kids need lot of mastery experiences. They'd learned to stay with something, focus on something. It's very important for their well being when they grow up. So, ah, luckily, I ha-- I, I just to conclude my story with my grandson. He's very good now at that. He does the way he works hard. He has a job. He graduated college and all of that. Anyway, uh-huh, he may never speak to me again. Okay. Okay, the next thing has to do with expressing emotions because children somehow often learn at an early age that it's not so great to express emotions that they're supposed to keep to themselves, some children. A lot depends on their culture and some culture as you express emotions a lot, you know, it's a part of a culture. In other cultures are keep it to yourself and you're very quiet but all babies express emotions. They just, it's, ah, to me and my feeling is, it's a learned experience. I mean you do have to learn to monitor your emotions so you don't-- I mean the children learn this quickly so it would not appropriate and all of that but, uhm, in certain situations. 

00:38:05
Developmental Issues Expressing emotions The child learns that expressing emotions are unacceptable, particularly anger. The organism attempts, in its quest for homeostasis, to rid itself of this energy. 

00:38:05
VIOLET OAKLANDER But sometimes, it's a difficult talk for a child to learn and, uhm, they learn they've not-- they even learn that it's not good to be afraid because we're always saying, "Oh, there's nothing that to be afraid of and then, look, let's-- there's no ghost onto your bed." Or-- and we know, we try to-- we, uh-hmm, talk away, excuse me. We try to brush away they fears which is natural. We don't want our children, it's very hard to say, "What does it look like? What does the monster look like? Would you draw a picture of the monster, show me. What shall we do? Shall we, maybe, turn on the light? It doesn't like light I heard. Let's keep a light on." Or kind of help the child deal it within themselves and accept the feeling. We don't like it when children cry and when they, uhm, we're always giving them candy or hugs, they shouldn't cry. Sometimes we yell at them. I've heard-- haven't you heard parents in the grocery store say, "I'll give you something to cry about if you keep crying." You know, yeah, so we don't like it when kids cry and we don't-- and the boys, especially learn a boy doesn't cry. So, ah, ah, the big feelings begin to get push down and press that we don't even like it if kids are too happy. They get-- we feel they're out of control. I mean I-- I'll give you a little example well, years and years ago, when I was a, a student teacher and I was in a-- I used to play the guitar quite a lot and I brought my guitar to this fifth grade class and the kids loved it and we-- I did that a lot. We, we sang every day. We sang songs and everybody sang and they just love the guitar and then they-- the master teacher said to me, "I don't want you to bring the guitar anymore." And I said, "Why?" She said, "They love it too much." And, you know, it kinda like it bothered her that they were and, and that's a true story. I mean I can make this stories up but, anyway, uhm, so we do su-- we do suppress the child. Anger, this is the first thing they learn that, uhm, it's not a good thing because they get yelled at or they get anger back, or-- it's very hard for children that they get scared of their own anger sometime because it builds up and, ah, it just too powerful for them. So I always said that if from the very beginning but I don't know if ever done that I haven't but own three children. Uhm, every night, you say what your angry about that day and clear yourself. I always thought when that be something. Every night, you'd say what made you mad or what your an-- it doesn't seem like a good bedtime thing but it would be actually good. I mean, I actually have advised parents to have what I called a mad session at night when they read a story and then, they could have this mad session where the kids say everything that made her mad that week or that day and you don't discuss it. You don't say, "Well, the reason that Suzie bit you because you hit her." You don't say that. You just say, "Oh, yeah. That's-- yeah, oh, that's hard. Yeah." And, ah, I mean it's, it, ah, it really makes a difference. It helps. Ah, have parents actually do that and, uhm, so, ah, but, but mostly children don't understand. They actually, anger is an expression of the self. I don't like this, I don't want this. It's kind of protecting your own boundaries but it cuts very confusing for kids. So, ah, I always assume that everything has some anger underneath, an expression of the self. Like if a child-- no matter what it is, phobias, ah, whatever, whatever it is. There's some root in there. Something they don't like and if they're unable to say what they like, what they don't like then we know, we have more work to do to build-- and help them build a self. Ah, okay. Ah, what's the next thing? I just wanna make sure, right, and went out of time. Limit setting. 

00:43:05
Developmental Issues Limit setting Parents must set limit for the child's health and safety. How it is done makes the difference. 

00:43:05
VIOLET OAKLANDER Of course, we have to set limits. Of course, we have to teach children not to run across the street or to put their fingers in the plug of whatever. We have to do that. It's how we do it. It's how we do it. I mean, ah, uhm, and if we're constantly hovering over our kids that's as bad as, you know, get-- giving them the message that you don't trust them. You have to be with them but you have to, ah, make sure they're not crossing the street but you can't constantly protect them in that way so it's how we set limits Of course, we have to. In the beginning they don't understand about limits or danger but, ah, again, it's how, it's how it's done. Ah, and, ah, and not took-- some parents expect children to understand immediately what the limit is, right. So I wanna make cultural expectations. 

00:44:10
Developmental Issues Cultural expectations Children learn what is expected of them based on the particular group in which they live. Problems arise when the child becomes part of a new culture. 

00:44:15
VIOLET OAKLANDER Ah, as I've said before, in, in some cultures, you'll have to be very quiet in church. In other cultures, you speak out along with the mini-- with the minister. I mean different cultures require different responses and that-- it's, it's important to know about cultures. I think I mention yesterday I worked in South Africa. I learned, instead, in South Africa, children are taught not to look an adult in the eye and so a lot-- and we have that, there a lot of children who won't look you in the eye and I've had, ah, in order to know that this-- if I were in South Africa working with kids to for me that, ah, a demand that they look me in the eye is, is really irritating and not helpful. So I've had actually therapist say to me and the agency I work in, I'm supposed to, if they work in a little children, I'm suppose to move their head to look me in the eye and, you know, it's very difficult to look somebody in the eye. Some, ah, may have had the experience of an exercise where you're asked to look somebody in the eyes for a certain length of time and then, the other person looks you, you take turns but that's kind of silly cuz if you're looking in the eye then the other person is in the eye any way. Ah, its easy to do that and, and if fact, it's important to withdraw. We talk about contact, when you make contact, if you never pull in, it's not real contact. It's fixed contact. You know, so contact and withdrawal is important but, uhm, different cultures have different expectations and we need to know those. Oh, this one is important, the systems. 

00:46:15
Developmental Issues Systems There are many systems that are affect the development of children besides the family system (which we tend to blame for every problem.) Some of these include the school system, court system, medical system, church system, and others. 

00:46:15
VIOLET OAKLANDER You know, we tend to blame the family for everything, right? We tend to blame the family for everything. The thing is that there are lots of other systems that cause and problems for children. Ah, many system, I think I listed there. I don't remember if I did. Anyway, there's the court system, there is the medical system, there is the school system, there are many sys-- the church system. Uhm, when I was a child, when I was just turned five, I was very badly burned and I was in the hospital several months and, uhm, boiling water fell on me. Ah, and the doctors and nurses, this was of course, I hope they don't do this anymore. The doctors and nurses used to-- actually say to me, "Be a good girl, stop that crying." I mean I was in horrible pain. I still even remember it. They'd say, "Be a good girl. Stop that crying." To this day, if I'm, if I express-- if I have pain I'm embarrass to say it because I'm not, I'm not a good girl but I realize that. So anyway, ah, it's, ah, it's something that had stayed with me for a long time. And many things every time, I ever did any work in my own therapy, it would go back to that burn in the hospital. So a lot of systems affect children precise the family and I've, you know, think we should minimize that. Like, okay, one is, uhm, say something. 

00:47:55
The Therapeutic Process • The therapeutic relationship • The issues of contact • Building self-support - strengthening the self • Emotional expression • Self-nurturing work to achieve integration • Dealing with inappropriate ways of being • Termination • Family work and parent education 

00:47:55
VIOLET OAKLANDER We talked about this process yesterday if you were here, the therapeutic process. There is a handout, oh, we have 10 minutes, thank you. Okay, I wanna just say something about organist make regulation, self regulation. Now what that is I'm sure most of you know what it is but for those of you who may not remember, what that is the organism which is me and my body, everything the senses, the body, the emotions, the intellect, make up the organism. The organism regulates itself. Now, for instance, when I'm talking a lot and my throat begins to get dry, my mouth gets dry, my throats starts to hurt and I know I should take some water but I, too, I'm afraid I'll forget what I've gonna say I don't. And that, after a while my organism say, "Well, gonna make it so that you can't talk if you don't take some water." Ah, it affects my throat and I can talk so I decide I'd better take some water. Okay, so I take the water. So I've achieve a little homeostasis, a little balance here and then the next thing, the next thing that needs to be dealt with comes up like waving my hands, oh, whatever, and that's how the organism works. It tells us when to sleep when-- we don't know who is listen but it tells us when to sleep and if we don't listen, we get sick. It tells us when to eat and when to stop eating, you know, but if we don't listen we get bloated or whatever. It tells us what to do physically. It also tells us, ah, other things as well. I mean, ah, have ever have experience where you want, it couldn't remember somebody's name and what I have but after-- well, you know, it's part of getting old. You forget names but anyway I couldn't remember somebody's name and I'm just like I am trying to forget it because it's driving crazy but forget and just go about my business. But then at some point, the names the comes to me. Oh, what a relief? It's that's the organism kind of regulating itself, achieving this homeostasis. So, uhm, uhm, it happens to be true emotionally as well so that, uhm, take the child is really upset about something. But let's say the child is really, boy, I talk to you about, he's trully upset about as parents screaming at each other all the time. In fact people-- and he thinks this is his fault but he doesn't show it, he pushes it down, he pushes it down. So what happens, the organism is trying to regulate itself so he, he, he can't-- he, he started-- the gra-- he can't study. His grade has fall. He can't talk to his friends anymore so he stays home. He just keeps-- he gets stomaches because he keeps pushing all of feelings down. He doesn't even know what he's feeling. It got to a point that he had no idea that this is happening. But at the minute we begin to work with him and he begin to express those deep block feelings about how he feels about his parents fighting. His anger, his sadness, his blame, self blame. He's-- maybe he's shame. All of that, the organism begins to relax and, and feel more balance. So it's an important aspect to think about it, too. Whenever I see kids who are showing symptoms in some way, it's their way of not knowing how to regulated the organism but how they're just trying to do it but they don't know how to do it or what to do so that's what we all come in. So I have five minutes and I, I, I thought well, maybe, you have some, ah, when not, you know, we-- if we-- I don't know you might have a lots of questions but maybe somebody has a burning question. We still have five minutes. Ah, you could come up to the microphone if you do. It's okay if you don't, okay. Sarah is gonna-- I'm he-- I'm hard of hearing and, ah, which I have been since I was 7 years old. Just so you know that it's not just old age so she's translating for me. 

00:53:10
[sil.] 

00:53:35
VIOLET OAKLANDER Yeah, and I, I don't know if you all heard that. If the process is established as the child can you remember that as an adult? Yes, I do believe so and that's what, what we do a lot. And, ah, to be-- but that's why I think even if you don't work with children, to understand development so that you'll know that many of us adult, most of us adult are carrying our childhood experiences with us and they get trigger or to so habitual, we still do the same kinds of things, ah, trying to take care of ourselves but yes, we become aware of what we're doing and why, and how we're doing it and we can make changes. Okay, one more. 

00:54:25
 Uhm, sometimes I find that, uhm, parents get frustrated because when the child comes a therapy they seem to almost not have any problems. They seem to do really and I sometimes get the feedback, wa-- why do they listen to you and they don't listen to me at home? And I was just when-- how, how would you deal with that frustration? And I do try to bring the friends in the therapy in terms for skills but that still seems to be an issue. 

00:54:50
SARAH Ah, I think what he's asking is that when did the parents bring the child into therapy - 

00:54:55
VIOLET OAKLANDER Yeah. 

00:54:55
SARAH - ah, the child seems fine? 

00:55:00
 Well, it seems, I, I almost get sense of it, it's like jealousy or, uhm, there's a sense of almost like you're stealing that parenting role, uhm, because their-- the kids seems to be bonding with you or -- 

00:55:10
SARAH Okay. 

00:55:10
 - listening to you and not with the parents at home. 

00:55:20
VIOLET OAKLANDER That the kids more responsive to the therapist than they were jealous. The parents are jealous. I've actually have that happen actually and, ah, at least the parent, ah, you know, I, I'd find out so if some-- if you know that that's happening, ah, you can deal with it. Work with the parent. Get the parent to come in and talk about that. What usually have is that they feel so inadequate. They feel so bad about their parenting that that's really-- I've, you know, I've had-- and I tell them, you know, it's really easy for me because I'm just with your child one to one and this time, that's-- I don't have to do anything else. I don't have to answer or wash the dishes, or went to the baby or anything. And you know, we talk about it. Yeah, yeah, but it definitely happens. Yes. 

00:56:10
 All right, thank you. 

00:56:15
VIOLET OAKLANDER Okay, I think it's time. It's such a pleasure to be here.
