The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAMEIM December 11-15 

00:00:00
ERNEST ROSSI I have a little bit of a hearing problem, you know, so I've got this humongous hearing aids. But they don't always work with technology. So, during the procedure you might see me look toward my wife and smile and that's her cue to make sure I've heard something whether it's the client or whatever. So, I'll begin with a 20-minute process with the entire audience. It's what I call the Creative Psychosocial Genomic Healing Experience. You can look it up in my books to creative con-- creating consciousness my book with my wife then evacuating new consciousness. Yes. We search and showing that using this procedure we turned on approximately 200 genes. This is a particularly wonderful time to demonstrate my work because around 4:35 o'clock there's a massive shift and you're seeing expression it's called breaking point. The genes that we're turned on to optimized your performance for focusing an outside world in your competence in the outside world are turning all and the opposite genes those are related to nurture bringing you closer to sleep and sleep are turned on. And we've had recent research showing that it's actually in our sleep. Why do we sleep? Because in our sleep there's 16 mo-- 16% more cleaning action in the neurons of the brain. I know this sounds little funny but you can look it up and sign would just come out, ah, two months ago and I'm starting to adjust my procedures. Classical hit knows this meditation anything that allows you to go inside and shut off the outside world for while. By the very fact that you're going inside I'm hypothesizing now that we're giving that 16% extra cleaning action. So, this sounds peculiar, you know, for, for centuries meditations, so for things. The old meditation purifies your brain. It clears up your brain. Well, you know, believe it or not something like that is really happening to us every night when we go to sleep. And I hypothesize also every hour and a half or to when we're awake and needs to take a break. So, I like to have your begin by just tuning in to yourself right now. And it is after 5 o'clock and most of you naturally feel a little bit tired. And in our culture we try to fight off the tired feeling we don't like to recognize it but that's the truth. Gene patterns are changing and if your sensitive for yourself turning into that fatigue, you know, they're seeing what part of your body like the fatigue and just we might say lovingly cradle that fatigue. It's yours you work hard all day and you deserve to rest, to have a good meal this evening and have a very refreshing night sleep. You deserve it, it's your natural, this is what nature wants to do. So, place your hands off about like this almost as if you've never seen them before and this begin the process that I call my Creative Psychosocial Genomic Healing Experience. And tune into which hand is actually experiencing just what you're ex-- where you are, how you feel right now? And notice which hand feels a little bit warmer or cooler than the other. And by the way part of me is saying, "I'm not giving you suggestions. I'm only talking the truth." If a scientist were here and measuring your hand temperature yes the scientist would know that they are slightly different. I'm asking you, can you sense that very real. So I meant heightening your mind, body sensitivity. This is not so much suggestion there will be as heightening you're at. Mirror neuron activities, the mirror neurons that reflect your inner, ah, world as well as the outer world. 

00:06:10
[sil.] 

00:06:15
ERNEST ROSSI And going on can you now tune into which hands seems a little bit stronger which seems a little bit weaker? So once again, I'm asking you to tune in heighten your sense of-- yes what are you sensing? 

00:06:45
[sil.] 

00:06:50
ERNEST ROSSI And shifting once more which of those hands are must feel the stronger? Which feels weaker? And again, don't look to me for suggestions only careful self observation of course one of your arms are slightly heavier or stronger. Yeah, there's weaker or lighter and you really tune into that are you-- yes, we're all therapies we all pride our self in our empathy. Yes, holds yourself empathy this evening. 

00:07:40
[sil.] 

00:07:45
ERNEST ROSSI And now I can continue from the sensory room to which hand, which side expresses you as you are today, your current age and which hand is more like young yourself. Yes, once again please don't take it as a suggestion take it more as a sensory. Of course there's parts through your brain there including the adult and it's parts to your brain are still cold the child and which part of your brain goes to which side? 

00:08:35
[sil.] 

00:08:40
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. That's what we're doing, we're learning to project brain states onto our hands temporally simply has a way of making the creed of unconscious so, so speak visible and other manifest behavior. 

00:09:05
[sil.] 

00:09:10
ERNEST ROSSI And by this time notice is there a sense of-- yes, what are you sensing? Are some of you beginning that comfort that's really there behind your natural feelings of fatigue at this time of the evening? Yes, that's what we're looking for. We're looking for that sweet spot and your mind body experiencing where, ah, you're giving up the efforts of the day and you're allowing yourself to go with the comforts of nurture, support, warm relationships. Yes, we're looking for that sweet spot that nature rewards us with quite naturally when we shut off our efforts to continually working, compete and focus out there and let nature do her inner work cuz that's what she wants to do. It's not Ernest Rossi hypnotizing you into relaxation. No, I follow Erickson's naturalistic therapy it's natural for you to just wanna let go. And it's very nurturing to reward yourself for being insensitive and empathetic with yourself. 

00:11:25
[sil.] 

00:11:35
ERNEST ROSSI So with this positive context feeling that makes us a safe procedure for whatever wants to come up all by itself within you. So, well now under one hand there is you, your ordinary consciousness and in the other hand there is a... 

00:12:05
[sil.] 

00:12:10
ERNEST ROSSI There is what? What is ex-- what are you experiencing? Ah, there were other hand that's little different from your-- I don't know if this takes you back to times when you as a child what was it like being a child in the evening? Yes, simply receiving even while the other side maintain this kind of observer attitude an attitude of self care. How nice it can be when you tune with in to know that there is a observer self care person on the one hand and in the other hand. Yes, what comes up? And lowing the observer to observe one part of you experiencing another part observing. One part of you observing your experience make me another part observing and hearing Dr. Rossi's voice. 

00:13:55
[sil.] 

00:14:00
ERNEST ROSSI So now let yourself continue with that sensing of the early evening as you get a bit older from childhood before 10 years old moving into the 10 years. Yes, what reminisces? What memories what it was it like? We know in our 10 years is an up rush out new brain plasticity, new gene expressing. What was it like when you could-- as a teen what you feel like to be able to shut down the outside world and tune into-- yes, what naturally came to you? What was the growing within you that the observer can empathize with. Yes, was or the new ideas a new feelings just a simple survey. How nice to know that you can allow nature to take yourself nurturing course and now it nice to know that yes there's an observer carefully cultivated what will train professional observer. And is very valuable for you to know this what an observers added to this toward you? Do you trust your observer absorbing it? I know observer compassionate, loving ideally supportive of you or-- yes. So continue for another couple of minutes letting yourself move from early teens, so 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and approaching now your early 20s. What was it like so lose evening experiences around this time of day as a young at all. What were you doing? Are you in school? Are you working? And what se-- then like at the time of day when you normally would come home and, ah, where you able to learn how to let go of the work world and come into the world of nurture. Was that natural for you in your young 20s? Or was that-- you see how I am not so much suggesting but rather I'm giving you opportunities to observe the simple truth. The simple truth that only you can truly appreciate. Only you can validate yes this is me as a kid, this is me as a teen. Yeah, this is what it was like it was like person starting out as an adult. And so you come up toward real life this real time and we're giving a therapy, depths administration, psychotherapy, counseling, coaching. How do you optimize? Yes, on the hand I wonder if you can experience what you would love to optimize in yourself right now this evening. Because on the other hand, ah, life isn't always peaches and cream sometimes you have issues. Yes, and this is what happen in your early evening hours as you prepare to sleep and dream. Yes, dreams are place where we replay the grow engage of our consciousness in order to make a-- yes what are the dreams trying to create me within you? 

00:19:50
[sil.] 

00:19:55
ERNEST ROSSI So this is a wonderful to allow your se-- self compassion empathy and really there's no taking it because there's not therapist or guru or whoever at this point in your life that knows better than you. Really yourself, who are you've been, how are you've been developing, and, yeah, the real truth, all right. Now, an issue that you're gonna hold your inner mind will do some creative work with this evening. 

00:20:45
[sil.] 

00:20:50
ERNEST ROSSI In a dream, in a fantasy, and we know nature is helping us in our sleep and dreams by opening that space between the neurons were allow more cerebral spinal fluid come in and literally wash away toxins, clutter from the day that you no longer need. So continuing now for another few minutes entirely on your own how generous can you be toward the part of you the child that maybe has something to say to you. The teen that still striving to get your attention. A dreams of the yelling adult and I don't know how many of you can actually begin to experience and inner dialogue between the adult side and the child. Between the adult and the heating and what are wonderful revelation completely spontaneous unrehearsed and I wonder how many of you are surprise, ah, what the child might wanna say to you or the teen or the yelling adult. Yes, this is an opportunity to simply receive, you know what from Dr. Rossi we see from within self that Dr. Rossi or anyone could not possibly know about only you can really know about... 

00:23:05
[sil.] 

00:23:10
ERNEST ROSSI And the observer part of you that's watching how Dr. Rossi is speaking. 

00:23:20
[sil.] 

00:23:25
ERNEST ROSSI Yes, you're learning also from Dr. Rossi something about your exploring something about how your observer you consult care taker is treating you. And what you need to tell your self care taker and this is really that us and so nature style like this happening new all the time. Everyday, everyday, every hour and half or two throughout the day go to or complete cycle of cognition, emotion turning on genes to adapt. Yes, that's the word what are you sensing that you're adapting toward this time, this moment. And sometimes it comes very simply and the blink of an eye. Oh, that's what been going on. Ah, yes, we see those quick little intuitions. Cuz that's all their simple intuition and especially if they're sending the more surprising deal. Welcome surprise. Welcome a novelty. Welcome the unexpected, because that's their sign point. Signs to your growing edge. And that's what we want to experience this evening. Your growing edge that Dr. Rossi know and really can-- that's right this is the sacredness of your consciousness why do we have consciousness? Yes, this consciousness is needed to deal with some say a quantum level of certainty about ourselves, our lives, our issues and then opportunity to experience our free will and to face of all this sometimes chaotic outer and inner world. So, I'm gonna allow you to continue for another moment or two knowing that all this remains private within you. All this is initiating-- that's right a simple dialogue between the adult care taker and the inner sources of who you are or what you're becoming. And yet, how time I have-- we been working already? Take a guess privately to yourself and as I look at my watch. Oh my goodness! I said I was gonna do it 20 process it's already 25 minutes. And that's nice if you underestimate the time, it means seems to go quickly and that quickness of time seeming to pass so quickly that's also indicative of creative state of mind. A state of inner absorption where you're really interested you're tuning into to-- with some theologians have called the numinous and what's fascinating, what's surprising, what's mysterious, what's tremendously absorbing for you. So, again continue for your another moment. And when, when something within you knows that, my goodness, you've-- we see something that maybe you can continue developing for yourself today, tomorrow, next year. And when you know that in another moment or two reality does intrude even here and you'll feel, yes there's another part of you that says, "Yes, this will be time to end this little mini therapeutic inventory." And what will happen, how will you come back to the room? For your eyes open first or will you, you shift your body position, your hand position do it slowly, take a full half minute or two to return to ordinary everyday awareness and taste it, this is you. Dr. Rossi, really doesn't know what you're experiencing nobody knows except you. This is valuable to know how you work when 20 minutes half an hour yes you can tune in and just receive something about what's going on and respond to it. So again, letting yourselves come back to the room and when our client-- people come to us it's usually in stage two of the creative process. You know, stage on is curiosity. Stage two sometimes when you get stuck trying to solve a problem. State three, is, uh-huh, you got a possible solution. Stage four is when use test a solution in the real world. I wonder, of course the audience of this side all of you are experiencing either stage one, two, three or four wide definition that covers all possibilities. But for an individual demonstration I'd like to ask for a volunteer from the audience. Not who's at stage one or three or four but rather someone who senses they're in stage two. Stage two is a difficult stage we use sometimes you do feel stuck or you feel in conflict, "Geez! I wish I wasn't feeling like this." That's a state when most people come to us for therapy and that's our skill transforming this crisis in a person subjective experience and had turn it into opportunity for them, a therapeutic reframe. So, if there someone who would like to come up and-- Okay. 

00:31:50
KATHRYN ROSSI Sit it there. You can... 

00:31:55
ERNEST ROSSI Wow! A big guy that can really-- would you like to have a sit here? Did you notice what I said? A bit guy who can-- yeah, that symbolic supportive statement. He's a pretty strong guy. 

00:32:20

00:33:00
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. Can you share with us only was appropriate to be shared with-- like to be share with the audience something about where did you go in this little process. Just a little sentence or two that gives us a clue is to what something I might need to know to help you go further.

And what's the big guy-- is there some issue, something that was interesting that you receive than you experience. What's the guy, big guy curious about right now? What-- how can we... 

00:35:15
DAN Ah, I'm, I'm a psychiatrist, I'm a forensic psychiatrist and I'm-- my training are very concrete. 

00:35:20
KATHRYN ROSSI He's a forensic psychiatrist. He's concrete you see, he's a linear sort of guy. 

00:35:25
ERNEST ROSSI Help. I don't deal with legal mind. I wouldn't have taking you-- a wrestle I could take you for but, ah, but a forensic psychiatrist, give me a break. Oh, I been watch out, watch my things in cubes. I'll get sued if I'm not. Well, I'm not gonna put any ideas in your mind. 

00:35:55
[sil.] 

00:36:00

00:36:05
KATHRYN ROSSI He'd like to know if this, ah, type of therapy would work for his patients. 

00:36:10
ERNEST ROSSI Well, I sure don't know that. But let's get a start I see if it works for you. 

00:36:20
DAN All right. 

00:36:20
ERNEST ROSSI First thing is first. 

00:36:25
[sil.] 

00:36:30
ERNEST ROSSI That's right taking that. See I took a deeper breath and Dan(ph) kinda followed me taking a deeper breath. Wow! But I'm not trying to program you. I'm trying to really enjoy the evening and lowing the natural healing that takes place at this time. Will you able to experiencing anything about sort and the group process?

00:37:00
KATHRYN ROSSI More relaxed. 

00:37:05
ERNEST ROSSI Good. Wonderful. Can you tell me what is behind that word relax for you? What are you actually experiencing as what you call relax, Dan? 

00:37:20
DAN Well, I was hoping that-- first of all my wife and my two little kids will not call me in to bother me. 

00:37:25
ERNEST ROSSI They're here? 

00:37:30
DAN Uhm, they went to eat.

KATHRYN ROSSI Happy birthday to you. 

00:37:55
 Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, darling Dan(ph). Happy birthday to you. 

00:38:10
KATHRYN ROSSI And many more. 

00:38:15
DAN Thank you. Thank you, you all are the same sound. 

00:38:25
ERNEST ROSSI Well, gift for you to be here in your birth day. 

00:38:30
DAN Yes. 

00:38:30
ERNEST ROSSI Well, a wonderful concordance of days and personal dates today. 

00:38:40
DAN I did enjoy it. 

00:38:40
ERNEST ROSSI Enjoying? 

00:38:40
KATHRYN ROSSI Yes. I think that he is going to be a master in enjoyment perhaps we don't know, in relaxation perhaps we don't know. 

00:38:55
ERNEST ROSSI Wow! That would be-- would you be interested in having a life like that relax and, and enjoying. 

00:39:05
DAN This is important my wife is telling all the time to relax to don't be so mad. 

00:39:10
KATHRYN ROSSI You know, his wife would encourage such a thing. 

00:39:15
ERNEST ROSSI Say it again. 

00:39:15
KATHRYN ROSSI His wife would encourage such a lifestyle. 

00:39:20
ERNEST ROSSI She would like... 

00:39:20
KATHRYN ROSSI She would like that very much. 

00:39:20
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. 

00:39:20
KATHRYN ROSSI That would be a birth day present for her too. 

00:39:25
DAN And, and my mother also is saying the same. 

00:39:25
KATHRYN ROSSI All the women in his life. 

00:39:30
ERNEST ROSSI Really? Was your mother like that too? 

00:39:30
DAN Oh, yes. 

00:39:30
ERNEST ROSSI She wanted to have a good life and... 

00:39:35
DAN She wanted me to be more relax kind of slow down. 

00:39:40
KATHRYN ROSSI Relax, slow down, he has this wonderful people in his life with wonderful ideas - 

00:39:45
ERNEST ROSSI Oh, my goodness. 

00:39:45
KATHRYN ROSSI - but I wonder what Dan's(ph) ideas are. 

00:39:50
ERNEST ROSSI You have a better background for that than I did. I never have a childhood. And I work hard and hard to get an education this and that and I, ah,-- 12 years ago I move to a beautiful place and my wife and I were gonna retire and boom, it happens I have a stroke. 

00:40:15
DAN I'm sorry to hear that. I heard about it. 

00:40:15
KATHRYN ROSSI But look at him now, he learned how to relax. He learned how to enjoy life he can teach you, Dan(ph). 

00:40:20
ERNEST ROSSI So the past 12 years I been in a kind of recovery. So that - 

00:40:30
KATHRYN ROSSI And you what? He's - 

00:40:30
ERNEST ROSSI - I want to join you. 

00:40:30
KATHRYN ROSSI - smarter now. He's, he's intellectually more gifted. He is clear, I think you're on to something, Dan. 

00:40:40
DAN Possible. 

00:40:40
KATHRYN ROSSI I think so. 

00:40:45
ERNEST ROSSI So, I want to be a guy like you with that sense of destiny of going toward relaxation, a good life. How about your inner absorber in doing the exercise, was it, ah, compassionate, was it empathetic and positive toward you or was it negative and punitive has happens? Even now at me sometimes when I forget myself. Well, what's your absorb-- inner absorber? 

00:41:15
DAN Well, I was trying too hard to concentrate myself to what you said and trying to absorb every moment. 

00:41:25
KATHRYN ROSSI You know, Ernie, he was so fixated, you know, this linear thing that Dan has he was so fixated on understanding you and trying to absorb you and your words that they kinda forgot all about the inner absorber. 

00:41:40
ERNEST ROSSI Oh, I see. 

00:41:40
KATHRYN ROSSI You see. 

00:41:45
ERNEST ROSSI Let me remind you then what's your inner absorber se-- added to-- toward you right now is it a positive empathetic compassionate supportive or is it they maybe even the reversible things? 

00:42:10
DAN No, it's not the reversible things it's-- I'm trying to be more empathic and more, ah, observer. 

00:42:15
KATHRYN ROSSI Yes, you know, he brought in a new you're gonna like, empathy. He's being more empathic on the inside of him. 

00:42:25
ERNEST ROSSI Oh, empathy. 

00:42:25
KATHRYN ROSSI Empathy. You know, that's higher consciousness. 

00:42:30
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. And you're experiencing that right now, Dan(ph). Okay, then from my prospective, Dan you're have a positive contacts that in your care taker is the positive place. If it's going to be possible to let your, ah, observer remain active as you let yourself go into place where you look at your present and future life in some mysterious way, spiritual way a deep genomic way experience the presents and your future life let yourself go on a present future journey and let see, let yourself experience keep of good recall of what your inner observer notices in the next five or six minutes. You know, what is a future life? 

00:43:55
DAN You want me to close my eyes? 

00:44:00
KATHRYN ROSSI You know, I really like this guy. You wanna know why? He's still asking you for permission to do things. He's saying, "Do you want me to close my eyes?" And you never ask people to close their eyes. 

00:44:15
ERNEST ROSSI You would never get me to-- I would never tell a person to close their eyes or keep them up because that would be giving them a directive. And if I give them de-- that directive and if they like me they will follow and be see that place is me in the director chair. I want the director to be within you. Now, for the audience I want to say, this is what Erickson would call, sharing the burden of affective psychotherapy. So, this is a critical encounter, Dan(ph) ask me and I'm-- my theoretical sense might believe in human nature so this I want Dan's(ph) inner absorber. Dan's(ph) soul. Dan's(ph) heart and mind to access his own destiny. Some part seem as if it's a positive orientation he has. How wonderful. So you see why I want-- yes I notice now your eyes are blinking, Dan(ph) and if that spontaneous eye blinking is a signal that your eyes want to close at this time that would be coming from you. That's right, wonderful and, Dan's(ph) eyes close kind of decisively. So, continue with your wonderfully close eyes and they are-- it is wonderful when they're close because we know you've got so much good stuff in you already. You simply need to tune in to that good stuff that wonderful ideology of your mother, your family, the young-- the whole perhaps is your whole culture in Romania that they had this wonderful ideal of a comfortable supportive good feeling just exactly what nature wants us to experience at this time of day. So continue privately within yourself for a couple of minutes. Now does the audience see how I shifted the burden or responsibility from the therapist carrying-- therapist working hard, big smart and clever even at this time of day. I shifted it to him. I used his body language that was a first time I notice a couple moments go on his eyes start to blink. And I pick it up immediately. That's was the first thing that Erickson thought me, "Look at the patient you damn fool, don't look at me when I'm working, when you re--" I thought the more important person in the room was Milton H. Erickson, "No! look at the patient." So continuing, so beautifully entirely on your own, Dan. And for something who are close maybe you notice that he's eyes are close but there's a slight little vibratory order that's taking place occasionally. Yes, it's like as he following in, in their image, their vision. It's just like REM sleep, of course I don't know. But I do know-- yes, just what Kathryn mimic that look. And how many of you been in classic art galleries where you see picture of saints of classic artwork the person is looking like this, transfixed. What is that vision that so many artist try to portray in their art? So this is an archetypal experience that Dan is going through. And his hands are simply open and lose a kind of receptive. I didn't say, "Dan, place your hands, open it and like you were going to receive something." I didn't say that but this is happening all by itself and this classic-- yes and Kathryn notices something about his breathing. Did I induce trans here? Or did I just followed behavioral inevitable for this? Soon as I shifted the burden of responsibility from that he was projecting at me and I put it back on him he's good stuff inside took over and did it. And I didn't say, "Close your eyes" I said, "If something within you wants your eyes to close so you can focus on inner world as it's appropriate realistically right now." Will those eyes close by themselves? I challenge you to listen to the tape of, of this session. That's a if you ever call a hypnotic conduction, I call an implicit processing juristic implicit, ah, word that means on an unconscious level. I offer to his inner world to his unconscious its creative one conscious. If it wanted to go inside would those eyes close to give me a signal? That, yes, it would be appropriate for them to go inside. So, continue entirely on your own for little while yet, Dan(ph). And this is as if it becoming a demonstration of what you wanted to learn and experience this evening is this an approach that you as a forensic psychiatrist can actually use therapeutically and creatively with your clients or patients. Yes, continue to pursue that question. Can you actually see yourself in Romania I don't if it's a office you have or it's a hospital. Yes, I don't know if you can actually see yourself with any particular patients. That's right. And I don't know if the camera can pick up on, Dan's(ph) eyelids because it really seems as if those movements are indicative or cognitive replay, cognitive exploration. Following inner-- yes, so now I'm giving Dan(ph) and opportunity to explore his own question. "Can I use this approach with my patient? Will it work?" And I said, "Well, let's see if it works with you." And now, he is exploring how it works with him. Now he's getting a real personal intimate creative interaction between the observer, the self director, the self carrier and the other part of him that's eager to learn. That's what were facilitating the creative edge between cognition turning on RNA which turns on DNA, which turns on messenger molecules that facilitates the brain plasticity to create neuron networks that become the underpinning of new consciousness that's possible for Dan(ph) at this time. Yes, and of course since Dan(ph) is a medical doctor little tactical language. And of course I said only the truth this isn't a tactical literature of translational medicine as well as psychology and will Dan(ph) actually look a little bit or carefully at this literature? That's right, you see the postural adjustment he's going through almost as if what specific reading observing his withdrawing from-- withdraw from that upper more of a spiritual exploratory more static to is he actually replying how he learn intellectually, professionally. Does the audience see how I use its very positive background. So continue for a little while again, Dan(ph). And to the audience I wanna say, hey, Kathryn is touch my wrist. She's alerting me to, you know, we're gonna have to bring to this to our conclusions of-- by the way Kathryn and I working our proper practice together and our usual sessions are an hour and half or two. So this is very unusual for us but yet yes we can condense and, uhm, they know appropriate situation we can try to condense it to at least 15 or 20 minutes to get the process cooking. To get the cognition turning on the RNAs in your mirror neurons. Mirror neurons that will turn on the DNA and so for. So is beginning a process of mind body, I call it mind gene search algorithm. On the old literature use to call this suggestion and some therapist saw that ne-- that they the therapist was, wasn't suggest. And Kathryn is pointing out that Dan(ph) mes-- manifesting in a very abbreviated way this nonverbal behavior that I'm exaggerating. So, the challenge I age myself in the wide up of this demonstration was how we demonstrate the four stage create a process. And how can we facilitate creativity, new consciousness without knowing an-- any deep, you know, that personal dynamics. How can a person work privately inside themselves? How can I facilitate that process? And by demonstrating that, I don't know what it like to take a look at a replay of the video that comes either this demonstration. If I demonstrated how within 20 minutes I can shift the expectation and burden from my shoulders that gave me so much stress that I had to go to a stroke. Until I really learn that Milton was serious when he said, "How do you shift a burden of creative work so the client does it." Somebody of our school is a psychotherapy teachers were suppose to be the experts and we better be an expert because somebody is gonna need to control this process and then better rid of therapist. Well, that's the conventional word with some-- ah, I like to challenge what this kind of a demonstration. So, continuing just for another moment or two, Dan(ph) and realistically knowing that it's time for us stop in a couple of minutes and what's gonna be like when some part of you knows that yes you can continue this process of learning, working with yourself, with your clients, with a appropriate literature. That's right the eye is open first before I could even finish my sentence. Thank you. Fantastic, Dan(ph). So is this a little blowy malarkey-- what's your criticism of this approach? 

01:00:15
DAN Well I cannot criticize you... 

01:00:15
KATHRYN ROSSI No criticism. Have to wait till the next one. 

01:00:20
ERNEST ROSSI What work for you in this administration if there's no criticism what is the opposite of criticism so you can tell us. This is a joke. Oh, God. 

01:00:30
DAN Well, I, I really feel, ah, relax and, uhm, I just feel good. Ah,-- ah,-- I'm wondering how much science is behind because during the residential training we learn a lot about medication and, ah - 

01:00:50
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. 

01:00:50
DAN - hypnosis is somewhere there in the back of - 

01:00:50
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. 

01:00:50
DAN - all the books. 

01:00:55
ERNEST ROSSI Can you summarize this for me in the audience when he said the essence of it just we've only got two minutes left. 

01:01:00
KATHRYN ROSSI Well, of course I can. 

01:01:00
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. 

01:01:00
KATHRYN ROSSI So, you know, Dan(ph) is a forensic psychiatrist and he love science and he's saying, "Well, when I was in school we study drugs, we did this, we did that but, you know, what's really the science behind this?" 

01:01:20
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. And he - 

01:01:20
KATHRYN ROSSI That's what he wants to know. 

01:01:20
ERNEST ROSSI - like to go enough silence so like you could heard yourself think, Dan(ph). Feel like you feel enough? 

01:01:30
DAN Yes. 

01:01:30
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. I did yammer and talk and continually direct. I gave them me-- I was to say the pore on some peace at this time if they relieve some peace. He has to find his own mind. Once I help our client get the expectation of direction from me on to looking into themselves for their personal experience and how they will direct it. I need to give silence - 

01:02:05
KATHRYN ROSSI No. No. 

01:02:05
ERNEST ROSSI - so they can do real inner work. 

01:02:05
KATHRYN ROSSI Ernie, your-- you heard silence but he said science. 

01:02:10
ERNEST ROSSI Oh, science! I'm sorry. Take them on blank just replace the word silence. So, it was okay the science that I manifest describing this process - 

01:02:25
DAN But... 

01:02:25
ERNEST ROSSI - is that the same? 

01:02:25
DAN No. The, the silence was okay I'm just wondering how much science is behind that. 

01:02:30
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. The profound silence. 

01:02:35
KATHRYN ROSSI Yes. Ah, you know, let, let me, let me help here. 

01:02:40
ERNEST ROSSI And it... 

01:02:40
KATHRYN ROSSI Because we're having so much fun. So there is science there is a beginning science to this process by, ah, researching in Italy where they found in two different studies the-- this experience, uhm, ah, causes a cascade of genes to express themselves. And in the second, ah, study there were 200 genes that began to express themselves and it's a preliminary science to this specific process. And so yes it's there and we hope that you'll be a part of that future. 

01:03:20
DAN Thank you. 

01:03:25
[sil.] 

01:03:30
ERNEST ROSSI Thank you, my friend. Wow! You are a big guy. Thank you so much. 

01:03:35
DAN Thank you. Thank you. 

01:03:40
ERNEST ROSSI Thank you for this. 

01:03:40
KATHRYN ROSSI Thank you and happy birthday. I hope it's a birthday you'll always remember. And you have the, you have the button to prove it. 

01:03:45
DAN Well, I know that. 

01:03:50
KATHRYN ROSSI Yes. Okay. Thank you all for coming. 

01:04:00
ERNEST ROSSI Have I selected to write co-therapist for me? Ohhh! 

01:04:05
KATHRYN ROSSI Ahh! Thank you. 

01:04:05
ERNEST ROSSI I don't have to over work. Thank you so much to all of you.
