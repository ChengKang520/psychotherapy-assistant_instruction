THE MINDFUL PATH TO HABIT TRANSFORMATION:A FOUR QUADRANT MODEL

LAWRENCE PELTZ, MD 

00:00:35
LAWRENCE PELTZ Well, good afternoon all. Umm… I'm Larry pelts. And uh… I'll tell you a little bit about me in a moment but those of you that are further back and further to their peripherally (inaudible) of the… of the room. You… you may find yourself sort of feeling drawn toward the center, I'm not sure how that's going to happen but it may gradually occur to you that it makes sense, or it just feels right, or just as a kind of a kinesthetic issue that you're, you know, you've feeling drawn to be closer to other people and a sense of cohesion. And that… that may or may not occur, I am not sure, umm… but we'll just trust that the right things going to happen here, uh… it always seems to so. Yeah. 

00:01:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible)… 

00:01:40
LAWRENCE PELTZ Yes, I'm going to want them to ask whenever… 

00:01:40
UNKNOWN Whenever, so you want us to go around with the mic? 

00:01:45
LAWRENCE PELTZ Yeah I think that would be best. All right. So welcome, umm… as I said, I'm Larry Peltz. I'm a psychiatrist, umm… I specialized in addiction if I have a job where I umm… Medical Director of dual diagnosis Partial Hospital, umm… and I'll tell you about that. I'll tell you about treatment, what treatment is with uh… with… for this presentation with an emphasis on psychotherapy. I was back in the early '90s trained as a mindfulness teacher at UMass Medical Center. I taught for two years and the UMass Prison Project and at this stage… Does everybody… Is there anyone who hasn't heard of the uh… the Center for Mindfulness at UMass Medical Center? Yeah, yeah, well, anyway… It's… the reason I ask that is that in at the time that I was… They started in 1979, Jon Kabat-Zinn, who is a umm… molecular biologist uh… doctorate from MIT. He's a… he's a quite smart guy but he really didn't know what to do with his life and he would say uh… a Zinn student, long-time Zinn student and a yoga teacher is teaching anatomy at the medical school and he hit upon this idea of taking patients that weren't getting better and teaching them uh… meditation yoga mindfulness in daily life. Umm… And doctors that didn't know what to do with them were willing to send them, and so they started out in the basement, it was called the Stress Reduction and Relaxation Program. And then, now umm… what is it, 37 years later, they're thousands of programs around the world, at least hundreds. There's one major one here at UCSD, and… and thousands of people have been trained to do this work called mindfulness-based stress reduction. So I did it mainly in prison that was my… my training. At the… at the medical center, people were generally umm… take problems that were not… just wasn't working. It was a lot of chronic pain, which medicine doesn't tend to be good with, umm… and Western medicine, and uh… stress-related disorders, umm… people with HIV infection, umm… a lot of desperation, and eventually, psychiatric problems, uh… depression, anxiety that we're not responding to the traditional treatments. And so they uh… people came and they learned these skills and things got better because they were… Umm… Well, we'll see, you know, the… umm… the… the two major reasons people come into psychotherapy is that their umm… experiential avoidance and self-criticism. These are two enormous reasons and so people with chronic pain would be, umm… you know, it doesn't get better, it doesn't get better, maybe it's a little better then it's worse, then they get angry, then they discouraged, then they get depressed, then they are in despair, then they're in their heads freaking out. Okay. So this practice umm… cuts into that in some way, which hopefully we'll… we will illustrate and hopefully this will be a… I mean, we're here, it's an ironic thing that mindfulness is about learning how to accept things as they are but really we're here because we want to get better. There's some tension there, actually around acceptance and improvement and… and to learn something about… to learn something from (inaudible) effect conundrum. All right. So we'll talk a little bit about why people come to treatment, what we do for them, with an emphasis on this idea of a four-quadrant model, which likely will be familiar to some of you in some way, I've just found it enormously effective. Umm… And I was effectively taught it by patients at a methadone program where I started out of… So now, this is… My wife and I have a little place, uh… little cabin, it's actually in (inaudible) where the meditation centers are in the central mass. And so here we are we're after meditating, you see that, see what… kinda good there, see that, see there. See that's before, see so before and after, see that. So… so hopefully that inspires you in some way. All right. So… so we're gonna, you know, the prelim that you can see the four-quadrant model is further along. I mean I'm about mindfulness and addiction is really the center of my work, my book is called "The Mindful Path to Addiction Recovery," which really came out of I dedicated it to a few family members and to the (inaudible)… I think I say the thousands of patients… patients that taught me most of what I needed to know. So this book really comes out of the work. Umm… So we're going to talk about mindfulness, we'll talk about addiction, we're gonna inter… intersperse it with Buddhist psychology. It's interesting the… I've become interested in hypnosis recently and it's… I… I used to struggle with the differences where. I really no longer do so much. Umm… Actually it's… it's quite seamless and… how many people have a mindfulness practice here? Great. Good number. How many people do hypnosis? Okay. Few. And how many people teach mindfulness to… Okay. Great. So this will be an opportunity… hopefully deepen your understanding of some of these connections mindfulness addiction and Buddhist psychology and also do some exercises, some brief exercises, as well as explore the four-quadrant model, you know. Yes, a lot of slides but I'll… I'll feel my way in terms of what seems important and also please ask along the way if anything occurs to you. Because we've… I really want to have a good time with you guys and try to meet that, you know, really what you're really interested in. So okay. So yeah, I was just gonna say, you know, hypnosis as a clinical intervention. Mindfulness has become a clinical… clinical intervention. Umm… And a lot of people, it's a great accompaniment to any form of psychotherapy. Umm… But it… Mindfulness, it's from a wisdom tradition. Okay. So there's a real difference there and they… but they, I think they go nicely together. Okay. So all right. So this is Bob is behind the guy and he swearing… swearing at them out the window and the caption says "Bob's journey of spiritual growth gets bogged down behind some idiot going half the speed limit." Now why is that funny? I mean, I laughed out loud when I saw that because I'm Bob, you know, it's like uh… I'm incredibly impatient, umm… and I've… I'm better. Because actually, this… I don't have a controlled study but God knows how I'd be without this practice, without the Buddha, I don't know where I'd be. So umm… Bob is suffering. Okay. And we're gonna talk about what that means, that one of the… the key thing is… the key issue is umm… the difference between pain… what's there between pain and suffering? We'll talk some about that. It's a very important difference. But, umm… you know, the four noble truths of the Buddha are, there is suffering, the cause of sufferings craving, there's a way out of suffering and fourth Noble Truth is what the way is, which is called the noble eightfold path and we'll… we'll make reference to this. This is… this isn't gonna be a tour de force on Buddhist psychology, but the… along the lines of this, this is an old zen saying that goes, "The obstacle is the path." All right. See that's not like us, we're like, "Hey, get that crap out of my way." You know, we don't… we think that that thing is in our way, but it turns out that is our way. Okay. And that's… that's really the challenge here. Okay. So all right. So you've gone to now a number of talks about this probably, umm… this is just a working definition. It's a simple working definition. Umm… Mindfulness is being aware of our mind-body experience, all right. Some of you may be doing that already, you may note just notice your contact with the chair, or obviously, you're seeing, uh… hearing my voice. All right. So you're aware of certain things. And in… in Buddhist psychology, there are six sensed doors and those are… The five senses we learned in the second grade, you know, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and the body or touching and thinking. All right. So these are the six ways in which information stimuli come into the nervous system or come into our mind-body process. All right. And then, there's one of three things happened. Umm… This is called umm… feeling, feeling tone. We'll… we'll work with this a little bit here today. It's a very important idea. This is one of the four foundations of mindfulness. The body, the force (inaudible) mindfulness of the body, feelings, thoughts and various phenomena but feeling is feeling tone, not emotion. Emotion goes more with thought. All right, this is… the three types of feeling tone pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral. Okay. So that's gonna be happening over the course of this talk. All right. I mean, some of you may have been very excited about this and then it disappointed by it or kind of like blah. Some of you maybe not so interested, although these days, people come to mindfulness talks generally are interested in it. But it'll change, pleasant, unpleasant and neutral is going to be happening throughout. So this is a psychology of the present moment with acceptance. Right. Now what does that mean, umm… well, I'll tell you what it doesn't mean. It does not mean we like it, all right, because the problem is the… the minus sign, that is there's a lot of unpleasant in life and we don't tend to like it, but the question is can we embrace it, can we make space for it, can we be okay or have a certain spaciousness around it? All right. So that's acceptance. And it's a… it's quite a challenge really, you may have noticed that. So just a couple of quotes, Psychologists Christiansen and Jacobs and changes the brother acceptance but it's the younger brother, and Carl Rogers, the corollary the paradoxes, when we accept ourselves we can change. So it's, you know, it's the devil's really in the details because we tend to want what we want. Not just addicts. Umm… I mean, we're gonna talk about habits in a broader way here today but addiction is a kind of a metaphor or a an extreme version, let's say. Other habit. Okay. So why don't we… let's just try something. 

00:13:55
[sil.] 

00:14:00
LAWRENCE PELTZ And this is an exercise that, it's very simple and it's something that you can teach people that you may have done… some of you may have done it. You can teach people that umm… are a little bit not engaging with you, they're a little bit off there, umm… you know, I… I had to make rounds at the hospital about a year ago and I saw 60 patients. I think probably 20 of them I did this with because they're not they're, you know, and they are… they can take anything in. Okay. So anyway… so you might just go ahead, get a good posture which is comfortable, relaxed, upright, dignified, you know, the kind of qualities we're trying to evoke in ourselves. 

00:14:55
[sil.] 

00:15:00
LAWRENCE PELTZ And you'll be able to notice your feet in your shoes. Might have a sense of the toes, the balls of the feet and some sense of an arch, the heel, top of the foot… 

00:15:15
[sil.] 

00:15:20
LAWRENCE PELTZ …and the legs making contact in some way, the butt in the chair, possibly a some part of your back. 

00:15:35
[sil.] 

00:15:40
UNKNOWN The hands and arms… So those are your touch points or your contact points. So you'll be able to notice those. There are even more contact points. There are some around the mouth, teeth, lips, tongue, if your eyes close, your feel your eyelids making contact. 

00:16:15
[sil.] 

00:16:25
LAWRENCE PELTZ So again, go ahead and notice those touch points, however, you do that you could make direct your attention to the body and see where you're drawn, maybe one area, or maybe more than one, or you might cycle through them like I did it. 

00:16:40
[sil.] 

00:16:45
LAWRENCE PELTZ So simply noticing the points of contact. 

00:16:50
[sil.] 

00:17:15
LAWRENCE PELTZ Okay. Great. So just as you're ready coming back gradually… 

00:17:20
[sil.] 

00:17:25
LAWRENCE PELTZ …Noticing what it's like to come back into the room. Great. Okay, so I think… I'd like to talk a little bit with people, so Amy you can just bring thing, what… I'd like to anybody what… what did you notice there? Anybody? 

00:17:45
AMY Raise your hand. 

00:17:50
[sil.] 

00:17:55
UNKNOWN Thank you. I became much more aware of my body, something of which I was not aware of until about five years ago. 

00:18:00
LAWRENCE PELTZ Uh-huh. Well, so what… where did you… what did… 

00:18:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible)… 

00:18:05
LAWRENCE PELTZ Yes. 

00:18:05
UNKNOWN My back, my butt, my knees, my feet. 

00:18:10
LAWRENCE PELTZ So that doesn't tend to be what you do. 

00:18:15
UNKNOWN It is more lately. 

00:18:15
LAWRENCE PELTZ More now. So you're more tuned. So… 

00:18:15
UNKNOWN More tuned to my body. 

00:18:20
LAWRENCE PELTZ Okay. So you are noticing that, how was that? 

00:18:20
UNKNOWN It was great. I… I do physical therapy every day now. 

00:18:25
LAWRENCE PELTZ So what was great… What was great about that? What would you say… 

00:18:30
UNKNOWN I love to be in touch with my body now. 

00:18:30
LAWRENCE PELTZ Okay. So you… it felt pleasant to you to do that. 

00:18:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:18:35
LAWRENCE PELTZ Great. Good. Thank you, thank you very much. Anybody else? Yes. 

00:18:40
[sil.] 

00:18:45
UNKNOWN I became aware of my breathing, umm… in a way that I'm not when I'm engaged in listening to something or trying to be engaged and distracted by other things, but I focus on my breathing. 

00:18:55
LAWRENCE PELTZ Great, so hang on… just a moment. So you're, umm… so where were you directing your attention anywhere particular, or you just went right to your breathing? 

00:19:05
UNKNOWN I would… I would focus on different points of contact. I would notice one, it would feel heavy and then it would get relaxed and then I would go to another part of my body, but then my mind would wander also to that cadence in my breathing. 

00:19:20
LAWRENCE PELTZ Great. Beautiful. So you're right… So there's… there's some creativity, that it actually, it's interesting. What I say here is not that important really, what's important is your experience. So… so… so you happen… I didn't say anything about breathing but that's what you were drawn to and that was… and what was that like to stay with your breathing? 

00:19:40
UNKNOWN It was energizing and relaxing at the same… restorative actually is the word I'd use. 

00:19:45
LAWRENCE PELTZ Boy, that sounds good for 15 seconds. That's great. 

00:19:45
UNKNOWN It was good. Yeah, shall we do that again. 

00:19:50
LAWRENCE PELTZ Yeah, yeah, well there will be another opportunity too. Okay. Anyone else? Yes. 

00:19:55
UNKNOWN I did not want to come back. I liked it there. 

00:20:00
LAWRENCE PELTZ Great. Beautiful. So… so please do more and try this at home okay. So what was your… what was your experience? Where… where would you direct your attention and what happened? 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN Umm… Just being aware of the touch points and missing away, I was aware of my neck and shoulders wanting something because they weren't a touch point, but they wanted to be included. 

00:20:30
LAWRENCE PELTZ Isn't that beautiful? Well, that's great. 

00:20:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:20:30
LAWRENCE PELTZ That's beautiful. I don't… I've never heard that before, but yes, see, all of our parts wannabe included, uh… including physical ones. Beautiful. Thank you. 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN So I included them. 

00:20:40
LAWRENCE PELTZ Thank you very much, beautiful, that's fabulous. Wonderful. Yes. 

00:20:45
UNKNOWN I found myself not thinking about anything in particular, just not thinking. And then, uh… for a few moments I did realize, I didn't hear a single sound in the room and it was almost as if I was alone in this vast space, it was rather pleasant. I knew I wasn't but that was the sensation that I had. 

00:21:05
LAWRENCE PELTZ It sounds cool. Yeah. So now what are you… are you used to that… to that experience of… of being quiet like that. Is that uncommon? 

00:21:15
UNKNOWN Yes, I am… I am… I've done similar things with clients. 

00:21:20
LAWRENCE PELTZ Yes, right. You know, this is… I'm… I'm glad this one came up. I was going to go for this but it just came right up, umm… that we think the time, you know, and a lot of it isn't good. Some of it is, right, but (inaudible) very surprised. I mean, when people come to me into day treatment programs are in the hospital, there… I mean, three things are true about all of them, their, umm… their lives are in a mess. Their energy systems are totally out of whack and they're in their heads. All right. And so when people do something simple like this, their… some of them aren't but many are incredibly surprised that their thoughts settle down. Uh… Because you know, they're thinking all the time and often it's a lot of self-criticism and negativity. So great. Okay. Okay. Yes. 

00:22:15
UNKNOWN Hi, I was doing the exercise and I was thinking about the tongue and the teeth and everything and suddenly I was distracted by my own thoughts, and I couldn't concentrate in my touch point. 

00:22:30
LAWRENCE PELTZ Uh-huh. So… I'm sorry. You started… what you start a your… what… what did you start to do. You're focusing on what? 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. I… I was listening to you, and I was doing the exercise, uh… feeling the Chair and my shoes, my feet and my tongue and everything, it was very good. 

00:22:50
LAWRENCE PELTZ Yeah. 

00:22:55
UNKNOWN And suddenly, I get distracted and I… I'm just have these… these kind of things when I am doing these exercises, every time I get distracted and I can't stop thinking about no sense things. 

00:23:10
LAWRENCE PELTZ Yeah. Thank you for that question. Beautiful. You know, umm… this is how our minds are. You're like umm… umm… very success driven. See, I'm like you, I was… when I first… what actually… when I first started, my mind was 90 miles an hour down the freeway. I was figuring everything out. It was fascinating but it wasn't meditation. Now it turns out the practice is not to have your mind clear and follow the instructions perfectly and be totally tuned in. The practice is to be with what it is and not hate what… My teacher says… she says, this is what it is. This is the practice. Relax. Be kind. Don't hate what is, trust this is the means. That's the practice. So if you're distracted, you're then you might make a little mental note and say, thinking, all right. Or planning, or you might feel some irritation. I'm… I'm sort of sensing this that there's a little irritation with yourself. Damn it. You know, I always start out, okay and then it goes, then I always go off and then it can't recover. Well, part of it may be, I'm… I'm just guessing now because I've got a mind to. You become disappointed in some way and then upset about it and then now you're a loser, or you're a failure at it. This is doesn't work. You know, it's easy for me to say you are very decent person who's well-motivated and have a great heart, and you… you really doing the best you can do with a very difficult challenging task. Right. But you… you don't say, you'd say that to a close friend or your, you know, family member but you don't say it to yourself. All right. So this is about the two wings of the practice of wisdom and compassion, so this is following the breath of noticing the touch points and going off is a real opportunity for compassion, self-compassion. Yes? 

00:25:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

00:25:20
LAWRENCE PELTZ The four points of what? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Relax. It's funny because when I was first coming up in the '80s, relaxation was like not the real deal. I mean, it was like we had all kinds of ideas. Relaxation is very important. All right. Somehow that was cheap, that wasn't the real practice. Relax. Be kind. Don't hate this. Trust, this is the mean… as the means. Don't hate what is shorthand for two things, umm… bring acceptance… Notice what is and don't wish it other. Okay. 

00:26:05
UNKNOWN What was the last one again? 

00:26:05
LAWRENCE PELTZ Trust this as the means. The means. Yeah so this is the way. Okay. So that's just a summary statement. Relax. Be kind. Don't hate what is, that's the way. Yes, sorry. Okay, great. All right. Okay, great. So this is what we're aiming at, this is embodied awareness. All right. We're living one moment at a time which we don't tend to do. We know the difference to our experience, our experience and a story. It's really an important difference. Umm… Some stories are good. You know, our patients, someone is react to, "Oh, don't tell me I'm telling a story." Well, it depends on… some stories are wholesome. You know, the story I told you about, you know, I'm a decent person who really cares and wants to evolve and grow, that's a good story. I would sit full speed ahead with that one. Okay. Umm… And then, you know, just a brief comment, you know, when I was trained, umm… it's psychodynamic work and the emphasis on stories, it's cognitive behavioral work on the emphasis on stories, uh… you know, metacognition, umm… we can say a little more about that… Essentially mindfulness of thought. It's actually nice accompaniment, mindfulness practice. This is a nice accompaniment to cognitive behavioral work because you don't got a dispute every thought then you can let a number of them float by, it's a lot less work and a lot less of an intellectual game. But anyway, I was trained psycho dynamically and so it was like one story after another and umm… you know, it was good… it was fascinating. A lot of people got well, you know, a lot of houses were bought in the Boston area and Los Angeles and San Francisco, around this type of treatment. People got well, but it wasn't… It… it had a certain limitation and it shows talking to a group of psychiatrists once, and one older guy said, you know, good psychoanalytic work integrates the body into the umm… into the therapy and I said to him, "Yeah," but you know, if they talked about that at my residency, I wasn't there that day. You know, they… we… I didn't learn that. Okay. I learned it through this kind of thing and through other sorts of worth is a lot of great models, now parts work models and hypnosis that include the body. Umm… So this is just a little thing, some of you may have heard this little jewel of a show that Garrison Keillor, does call the writers almanac umm… at the… he read the poem whatever it is and at the very end he says, "Be well, do good work and keep in touch." Now this is really good advice. And it turns out, I mentioned the Noble Eightfold Path. It coincides with one section of the path, it's three sections. Our ethics or Sila or ethics uh… Samadhi or the meditation part and which includes mindfulness and wisdom. And this is the… the… the bedrock really of it, you know, that right action, right speech, right livelihood. It's very hard to meditate when you've been umm… doing dishonest stuff all day. Right. Whether it's in business or you're lying to people. So this is really very important and of course, many of our patients are doing a number of things that aren't wholesome either in their lives out there addicts certainly a lot… a lot of things, they have remorse about and guilt, but also to ourselves. So to begin to notice these… notice what's the underpinnings of this practice. So this is… as I say, I'm gonna say a little bit about addiction, umm… as a prelude to talking about habits. Umm… It's just a… it's a dictionary definitions, kinda like state of physiological, psychological dependence on a drug liable to have a damaging effect, habitual compulsive and the Latin given over award at a cheery, watered as slave to another as a slave and indeed we are slaves. And… and it's a kind of a shape shifting problem. It… You know, I like the second one when I was a resident, you know, it's like, oh, this is part of like a character flaw or missing piece of the personality. But it turns out, it kind of at different times. I mean, a disease is more of a medical model, umm… then there's this character model, this umm… umm… more the mindfulness model and sort of transfer dissociation, you know, if you're doing hypnosis or you're talking about trauma. So these models are… just don't get too attached to it, you know, and if a… if a patient is talking about it in a certain way, it's important to understand the metaphor that makes sense to them. Okay. And there's a continuum here, umm… and just a couple of brief illustrative cases, this is a… Tom is a… It's kind of a made up case including me and a number of people I know, basically a good boy who has fun and at some point, you know, and manages pretty well. And… and… and he's getting high on the weekends and you know, the question is… is this substance abuse, is it? 

00:32:00
UNKNOWN No. 

00:32:00
LAWRENCE PELTZ That's correct. According… at least, according to the DSM-4, DSM-5 is… is similar. You've got to have a problem in umm… you know, the area of major role obligations or jeopardizing yourself in some way to qualify for substance abuse. So if Tom gets his… gets to work on Sunday and then gets a B plus or A minus on his organic chemistry exam on Tuesday, that's not substance abuse, where if he gets a scene, if… if on Sunday, he rationalizes and watches football games all day and gets a C minus that is substance abuse. Okay. And then his parents could read them the right act and say, "We're not gonna pay $50,000 for this kind of thing." So anyway this here's another case, this is a true case, Luis came to treatment, she had a breakup. She's been using marijuana to control anxiety. Umm… She was not doing well but she was stabilized to self around and she'd sit with a boyfriend, they'd watch the Red Sox, that feel cozy but then when the break-up, she just came apart and umm… and was overwhelmed and so this is the substance use disorder what they're calling the DSM-5, where you have tolerance withdrawal or just a persistent, it takes over your life, right. And this… this fellow is not, umm… doesn't seem dependent on the drug, right, but he's kinda zones out and his wife is disappointed, unhappy. All right. And so she may leave him, but he actually he left her first. He doesn't realize, so I think Frank's an addict and not everyone would agree with me, but I think this is… this kind of thing is not in common. Okay. So just a couple of things, I don't spend a ton on this, and this is more of a medical, this is Richard Sandor, his little book, "Thinking Simply About Addiction." And he calls it a disease of automaticity. That's an automatism is in the nervous system, it can't be eliminated but can be rendered dormant. All right. Experience of powerlessness loss of control, you can… you can turn the automatism off but it's still there. Okay. And… and this responsibility in dealing with the behavior of not in having the disease. All right. So that's a… that's a medical view of this and this is Lance (inaudible), who's a psychoanalyst, who says virtually every addictive act is preceded by a feeling of helplessness, umm… the behavior functions to repair the underlying feeling by creating a sense of feeling empowered. So this is sort of the missing piece idea. The net effect to be out of control and the… and the drive behind it is rage against powerlessness. So… so this is a… it's a… it's a different view umm… and which again, whichever one applies to your patient, uh… and however… whatever makes sense to you. So this is just a kind of a brief umm… illustration of what happens. This is from Jud Brewer, who's a, umm… he's the Director of Research at UMass at the Center for Mindfulness. Umm… Basically, we get Qs, Positive and negative Qs that cause effect so if there's a young woman who wants to… is anxious and she comes to a cocktail party and she has a drink, this would be negative Q and negative effect, right. She umm… umm… drinks and then feels better, all right. Then when she comes back the next time, there's going to be a certain memory of this, all right. And then, it's eventually a wanting it, right. And sort of feeds the behavior and it… it reduces the negative effect and then, umm… it reinforces it and then it feeds back into the system. So the habit gets strengthened. Right. The… the… the capacities tend to atrophy. This is parenthetically one of the reasons I… I really try not to use benzodiazepines with people because I think it atrophy is their capacity to, I never say never. You know, some people have such disabling symptoms, but it… Atrophy is the capacities to… anxieties part of life. Can you learn how to be with it? It's really empowering. It's uncomfortable for sure. So… Or young man that on the other side, a young man that smokes with his peers. A lot of kids don't want drugs, they want friends. So they're part of something now and then they… so that… that's a positive effect and that reinforces the addictive behavior, sense of belonging. All right, so basically what happens is there's an intolerable experience, consciousness changes, there's a craving sort of avoid suffering. It's the cause of suffering too and then we sort of cling to it and then we become something, right. So it is suffering, now it is suffering and then it's sort of contains this intolerable experience and then it just doesn't go well. This is a lot of what, this is why a lot of us make a living because the… uh… not just people who treat addictions but because they don't come because we're nice. I mean, we're adults. I… I won't deny that but they come because they're in a mess, all right. And often it's something like this. So mindful… addiction or habits tend to be mindless. Right. So this is… it's somewhat… it's a… it's an antidote or a counter force so the addiction or the habits are predictable. they thrive in the dark. Umm… They create suffering, you… you're… you're escaping, we'll get to this when we talk about our model and also it becomes a prison. All right. And mindfulness is more opens up the lens. Mindfulness can be like a camera lens, it can focus very narrowly or it can open up really wide, right. And it… it it's clear seeing, so you can begin to understand and let go of things. And a vehicle toward freedom, ultimately where we're going. So let's… let's try one more exercise here and I change this. I was just going to do something about sensation but I was drawn to this because I feel like it's… it's particularly important. Umm… Did anyone go to Robert McNeal's talk, this morning? Yeah. This is a… this is somewhat resonant with what… what he does. He's been one of my teachers, so I umm… I'd like us to notice and I'll just take you through a simple exercise. As I said, this three feeling tones pleasant, unpleasant and neutral, I'll talk a little bit more about that and what you might do with that, but for now, I'd like us to focus… work more with pleasant feeling tone. Okay. So again, you might go ahead and find a comfortable posture… 

00:39:30

00:39:35
LAWRENCE PELTZ And your eyes may want to close or not… 

00:39:40
[sil.] 

00:39:45
LAWRENCE PELTZ Tuning inside or staying outside, however, you're drawn. 

00:39:55
[sil.] 

00:40:00
LAWRENCE PELTZ You might begin again with a some sort of grounding we've been talking so. Just let go of the thinking or allow the thinking. You know, there's no need to get rid of it, we're just noticing if the mind is noisy, just what it is. But… but you… you can direct your attention, can control that, I should say. But you can direct your attention to the body, maybe the touch points or maybe the breath, either at the nose or the belly. Maybe taking a little bit of a deeper breath or two, just to come into the body. 

00:40:55
[sil.] 

00:41:05
LAWRENCE PELTZ And so beginning to notice feeling tone… 

00:41:10
[sil.] 

00:41:15
LAWRENCE PELTZ …and there's pleasant, unpleasant and neutral feeling tone, but you'll be able to notice something pleasant. It may be as simple as the feet on the floor, feeling comfortable and new shoes are grounded or the… the chair holding you. 

00:41:45
[sil.] 

00:41:50
LAWRENCE PELTZ Some people feel some subtle or sometimes even strong pulsations or vibrations in the hands… 

00:42:00
[sil.] 

00:42:05
LAWRENCE PELTZ …you may have a pleasant feeling in the forehead and on the area of the third eye or around the heart or possibly just a little smile at the corners of the mouth. It's a nice way to encourage pleasant feeling. Allow the mouth to smile from the inside, that smile can spread down into the area of the heart or the belly. 

00:42:45
[sil.] 

00:42:50
LAWRENCE PELTZ Just noticing pleasant sensation. 

00:42:55
[sil.] 

00:43:15
LAWRENCE PELTZ Okay. So coming back, gradually as you're ready again. Okay. I… You know, I would love to… I mean, I have so much fun when we talk like we did the other time but I… maybe let's just get a couple of people, just I'd love to hear what people noticed. Anybody? 

00:43:40
UNKNOWN Raise your hand. 

00:43:45
[sil.] 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN I had a hard time coming up with a pleasant feeling other than the rooms are perfect temperature and then you said just the corner of your mouth smiling and I noticed how when I did that actually did feel the pleasant feeling all the way through my body. So it's interesting. 

00:44:05
LAWRENCE PELTZ Wow! Well, that's very interesting. Thank you so much because you… you go. This is what we do. You said, except the room was a pleasant temperature… the perfect temperature, somehow that wasn't good enough for you. I mean, we… we… it's like something should have been better, right, but… but the room is a perfect temperature is a pleasant experience. Yeah. So great, so and then yes, it's a… Well, (inaudible) Han teaches this that a little… some people don't want to smile because they were told to smile as children for photos and stuff. But… but yes, smiling can bring a, you know, it takes a lot… you've heard it takes a lot… fewer muscles to smile and to frown this kinda thing. So there's a certain letting go and that but thank you. Yes. 

00:44:50
UNKNOWN I was really worried because I just lost my glasses but the smile, so my brain was really going wild but that little smile thing just brought me out of all of my thoughts… 

00:45:00
LAWRENCE PELTZ So well the thoughtless seemed to fade or you just wasn't troubled. 

00:45:05
UNKNOWN Just faded. I just wasn't as trouble I really could focus on the pleasant feeling, especially around my mouth, that was noticeable. 

00:45:15
LAWRENCE PELTZ That's great. Yes? Yeah, one more. 

00:45:20
[sil.] 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN Thank you very much. First, when I hear the word tuned, I immediately thought about music and I was remembering Johann Sebastian Bach here, and a few years ago, I was on a street in Europe and there was a guy playing beautifully. So as you… as I was listening to you, it was like, I was listening to Bach, having very nice sensation, especially, on my back because when I came in I was cold and it was really nice. 

00:46:00
LAWRENCE PELTZ Great. 

00:46:00
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:46:00
LAWRENCE PELTZ And so what was the pleasant sensation? 

00:46:00
UNKNOWN That music. The music that I'm getting… 

00:46:05
LAWRENCE PELTZ So it's interesting you had… you had an association to Bach. See, that's beautiful. See, I didn't… I didn't say anything about that, all right, but yes, you had a nice association and that was your pleasant experience. Fabulous. That's great. That's great. So can people see the applicability of this to our lives? Anybody? Yeah. I'll just say a little bit about it. I did a whole weekend with somebody. I mean, this is really about mammalian physiology that we… we are drawn to uh… pleasure and that's hardwired into us. Umm… And then we create a lot of trouble. Now if we can focus on something pleasant, it's an… it's… it's… I mean, the example… your example of losing your glasses, you know, I was… I wasn't quite freaking out because I figured I'd get some help but I got a little water in my computer today and it was really spacing badly and here I'm supposed to give my talk and all. And, you know, it's like stuff happens. You know, when we… we do get upset, but then, if we can walk, or move, or ground, bring something pleasant, not to outrun it, sometimes it's just like read or listen to a little bit of music, or just be outside and be with the dog or be with whoever that we feel, and it… it simplifies life and it gives us a chance. You know the Rob McNeil, he worked so powerful, this… he's talk… he calls it easy hypnosis. He… he asks people what they're like, or Erickson did this. You know, he wanted to know about people's hobbies. Right. And… but so when people are in what they like, they had… they're very well-resourced. First of all, they feel some combination of contentment, interests, pleasure, excitement, competence, confidence and they also are willing to put up with stuff, right. The… if the problem, so you know, if you're gonna be a serious cyclists, where you have to be able to put up with stuff going wrong with the bike, right. If you can't put up with that you're or skiing, you know, if you can't put up with the cold, it's not gonna work. All right. Great. So yeah, so try this and actually, when you… when you walk, you might notice your body just simply making contact, you feel the breeze so beautiful here and the whole temperature is so beautiful and the motion, things like that, and find something pleasant and notice what happens. And then, at some point, you can bring in unpleasant and neutral too because it keeps changing. This is a psychology of impermanence. Okay. I'm gonna go through this very fast, you know, how they say a picture's worth a thousand words, this is like a lot of words to make a simple point. All right. Now I'm gonna go through it, right. You have the slides on the website. So these are our addictions or habits, and umm… these are the ones that we… these are the things that we ingest. These are some behaviors, it's non-exhaustive list, exhaustive list, you notice meditation is on that list. Umm… You can get attached to certain mind states, you can get attached to avoiding life through meditation. There can be a primal problem. And then various kinds of thinking are problematic and also energy management and I tended to be an adrenaline junky. I'm… You know, I sort of began to see the limits of that, you know, so there's something good about it. Impulses. See, notice, we're starting to see some diagnoses here, you know, diagnoses or habits, the habits of mind, all right. And… a more diagnoses. All right. These are… I mean, depression doesn't sound great, but it really works, it's like anesthesia. It's… it limits role obligations, so there's a number of benefits from it and defenses, right. These are things that work and they don't work, umm… we need them and they limit us. Okay. So you know, it just… it hadn't gotten the point by now. You know, any human process activity. Uh… The Red Sox… in the Red Sox or religion, make no mistake. Now some… I don't know if the padres are one and the cubs sort of are… the Yankees really aren't. I was a Dodger fan, the only time I ever cried was when the Dodgers (inaudible) Giants in the playoffs in 1962 at a sporting event, that's the only time I cried, I was 10 years old. So you know, we get very attached to these things, umm… so any… any relationship or diagnose, the defense can become an addiction or the language of Buddhist psychology and attachment and this is from my writing coach Sean McClare(ph). It's all on a continuum, right. So why do people use drugs? Why do they use drugs? Anybody? They what? To cope, yeah, to cope with what? To… Did you say anxiety or rage? Sorry. Thank you, yes, yep, they feel good, any other reasons? 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible)… 

00:51:30
LAWRENCE PELTZ They relax, yes. Yep, there you go. Bingo. This is dated now, your condition is serious Mr. Reynolds, but fortunately recently scored some excellent weed that should alleviate your symptoms. Okay. So obviously that's dated in California and Massachusetts now. Umm… People use drugs for three reasons and to habits, to get a feeling, to get rid of a feeling or self-medication and to escape. I could put it in those categories, if you can think of another category you can say so but… and you can get attach to a number of feelings, you can high and low, peace and agitation, the ones on the right, don't sound so good. But say, people can attach there. You get a kind of a certain umm… identity or a certain way of living that limits the demands on you or something like that, when you attach to those things. It's not very pleasant. So you're avoiding present reality, you're controlling experience which we really can't do and ultimately you suffer. So and the good news is that works to create a controllable experienced seemingly, and then, of course, it doesn't work, we get further from our actual experience relationships and the truth, you know, like narcissism. It really works in a way, keeps people out but it also… you can't get in. If you think of it as a translucent wall around you, if normal functioning is semi-permeable membrane where you can give and take, based on the circumstances, well narcissism is protective, right. So you can… you can, you're protected but you also can't get the… you can't connect. Right. Okay. So anyway, so this is treatment. People have… as I said before, they have to be exhausted or I think, I call the chapter of my book, Chaos and Exhaustion, What's Bringing You, it's like what's the chief complaint. That's what we got. Why are you here and how can I help you? So this is a medical approach to problem, at least in the beginning of problem oriented approach, then… once we understand it, there's a conflict because they're in front of us, you know, 6 or 12 months ago, they weren't. They were… they were getting drunk or doing whatever they were doing. Now they're with us, with the privilege of helping them, so they're in some conflict, so the challenge is to frame that conflict, all right. If they don't have a conflict, I will generally return to why they're here, umm… and usually we can do… we can get there because everything has pluses and minuses and we'll talk more about this when we get to this model in a bit. So and then, had his treatment help? Well, it… it formulates the problem and it… it begins to umm… tune us into what we can do about it, right. And… umm… and so it could be addiction, it could be something else and we're… we develop a plan to approach that, and treatment is for things, recovery, recovery is you're not alone. Okay this 12-step recovery but this is, you know, I'm part of something greater than myself. You can get it in church, you can get it on a softball team, you can get it having knitting, you can get it having coffee with a friend or other. Psychotherapy is we know, what it is… it's how… what's my problem and how do I relate to it, what are my strengths, difficulties, conflicts, grief of resources, how do I approach this in a way that helps me. Medicines for symptom relief and mindfulness is for living one moment in time, that's treatment, umm… at least where I work. So yeah, so I'm going to skip through some of this. Umm… you know, the poem by Mary Oliver called Wild Geese, most people have probably heard this by now. It really captures what recovery is. You know, "You do not have to be good, you do not have to walk on your knees for hundred miles through the desert repenting. You only… only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves. Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine. Meanwhile the world goes on. Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain are moving across the landscapes, over the prairies and the deep trees, the mountains and the rivers. Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air, are heading home again. Whoever you are, no matter how lonely, the world offers itself to your imagination, calling to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting, over and over announcing your place in the family of things." You do not have to be good, that's recovery. Okay. So this is a model, we'll… we'll… we'll… Did everyone get a worksheet. Amy? Could you pass those out now? 

00:56:35
AMY They're all gone. 

00:56:35
LAWRENCE PELTZ They're all gone. Okay. All right. Well, so… so some people have them? Great. Okay. It's very simple, you know, just… I'll just tell you how to do it on a blank sheet of paper. Basically you make a cross on the page, every habit has pluses and minuses you see that across the top drinking is the model here, there's something good about it the three reasons people use drugs, there's a downside, there downsides… there's something good about sobriety and there's something bad about sobriety. That's the… that's… that's important, we'll get to that. Oh, something difficult about it and but bad. There is something difficult about it. So… so this is the exercise, now I'm just gonna take you through this, so those of you that don't have the… the sheets. This is what it looks like. Okay. Pretty simple. Draw line, draw… draw a across… across the page. What's good about the habit and what's bad about it or across the top, what's good about sobriety and what's bad about it across the bottom and then, I named the quadrants but we'll get to that in a bit. Okay. And this is on the website if you want to, you know, print it out at home or something. All right. So let's just do a little exercise. So… 

00:58:00
[sil.] 

00:58:05
LAWRENCE PELTZ All right. So this is a different kind of experience. This is not exactly a meditation, but some guided exercise. So you might just allow yourself to settle again and go inside, however, you do that. 

00:58:20
[sil.] 

00:58:25
LAWRENCE PELTZ Okay. And if you would bring to mind a habit of yours, that is… maybe not your absolute worst but something you've thought about changing, that you'd like to change… you may be ready to change it or you may not be, but that doesn't really matter. Just something that has… maybe you've been doing it for years or maybe you've just suddenly become aware of it because life is challenging. We do all kinds of things to feel better and they really do work sometimes and then other times. We'd begin to wonder if we want to change. So go ahead and bring that to mind, just some habit it could be something you ingest, it could be some way that you spend your time. It could be something that you do in relationship that at times is problematic, maybe has some positive things for you but at times it's problematic. It may be something that you do in your own mind, some sort of a habit of mind. Any number of possibilities. Okay. So go ahead and notice that habit and now I'd like you to bring to mind what's… why you do that? What's good about the habit? Don't yes but yourself now. There'll be time for that we will get to that but for now just stay with the what you get out of it, what you enjoy, what you value, how it helps you with any number of feelings or emotions that are difficult or how it passes the time. We'll just go ahead and notice the benefit of your habit. Okay. Now… now you can go to the other side. Umm… Go ahead and notice the problems with it, why you… you chose that for this exercise? Why? How it is a problem for you? Or how you're… You know, you get something out of it but then you wind up being disappointed, uh… in one thing or another and you're… you're… suffering a bit you're dissatisfied some ways. What's the downside of this? Okay. And now third question, if you could change this habit, now you may not be ready to, that's fine, you may be massively conflicted, you may be clear you want to change it or you may not be ready at all, but what would be the benefit, what would be good about that, what would you get out of it? How would it help you? How would it enhance your life and your experience? Okay. All right. Great. And the fourth question is what would be difficult about doing that? What would you miss if you stop doing this behavior? Or if you operated differently somehow? What might you lose? What might be disorienting. 

01:02:25
[sil.] 

01:02:30
LAWRENCE PELTZ Okay. Great. So again, umm… just returning and… and let's get… I mean, it would be great to hear from any number… Yes? Yes, the fourth question is, what is… all the four? Yes, of course. What's good about your habit? What's not good about it? Or what's problematic about it. All right. Then if you could change, we could call it sober or but we could call it letting go of the habit. What would be good about that? What would you get out of that? And then the fourth question is, what would you lose or what would be difficult, how would your life be problematic or painful in some way? If you… Yes. Sure. 

01:03:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible), probably, the therapy that (inaudible) tell me about the pros and cons of that? 

01:03:35
LAWRENCE PELTZ Of doing what. 

01:03:35
UNKNOWN So going to these four questions. 

01:03:40
LAWRENCE PELTZ Well… 

01:03:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

01:03:40
LAWRENCE PELTZ Well, I think it's fine to… I generally do it. I sometimes do it, you know, in sort of a hypnotic way with people and they… they will, uh… it's just different information but I think that, umm… Yeah. I mean, this is not umm… totally original. I mean, I… I… I… I… I was medical director on methadone program, out of medical… out of… I'm sorry residency and I didn't know anything really. I mean, I had no training and so I get these consults about that word, it had used dirty urines(ph). And somehow, I don't know why, I was moved to say, what… what you get out of that? You used heroin or cocaine and it was so much more fun than saying, "Hey man, you better if you don't pull this together, you're as soft the clinic, you know. And they tell… tell me everything about it or they might say, "Well, I say what's good about cocaine." Somebody said to me, "Well, nothing. It's terrible. I don't even want to do it and I do it." And I'd say, "Well, you're smart guy, that sort of persists." I say, "You're a smart guy, you were getting something, right? You… why'd you do… I mean." Right. He said, "Well, I… I guess I got the soaring feeling and then… but then, it could never reproduce that," and then, of course, it gets in your brain and then you're an addict, right. So I just discovered this, so when… when I first heard about motivational interviewing about 10… 15 or 20 years ago, I said, "Hey, wait a minute. Didn't I invent that with my patients at the methadone program?" But it turns out a lot of clinicians who are trained in a conflict model have done this, I mean you came to it yourself. You know, it's like this is so… Yes, so going through this in a comprehensive way. I mean, this isn't fancy, but I find that going through this and we'll talk about it in a little more detail about how to work with this that makes some of these points, but yeah, I think either way is fine, and this is powerful for people who are lost in a habit, you know, a lot of lot of psychotherapies has a trance elements in it and people are… you're… you're getting them to think about it a different way. One of the things I love about this with patients is that, it's no new facts. When I read it back to them, I didn't make up any of it, they told me everything, I just put it in a different order and they always learn something. So yeah, I wouldn't worry about that so much about how you do it. Yes. 

01:06:10
UNKNOWN So explaining this? Are you going to… 

01:06:10
LAWRENCE PELTZ I am yeah, that's so. This is the title of the talk I better explain it. So… so all right. So on the left. Okay. So anyway. Let's get to just a couple of examples. What did you learn from this? What you learn from this exercise? And it could… you could tell me your habit or you could not tell me your habit, doesn't matter to me. 

01:06:30
UNKNOWN Well, I learned I'm probably not ready to change because when you invited us to come back to the room, I check in with my body real quick and it was like totally rigid. 

01:06:45
LAWRENCE PELTZ Yes. 

01:06:45
UNKNOWN Thanks for that. 

01:06:45
LAWRENCE PELTZ Well, that's good information. So you're not ready. So can you be kind? Can you be kind as long as it's not life-threatening? Can you be kind that you this time ready to do this? 

01:06:55
UNKNOWN Right. Mm-hmm. 

01:06:55
LAWRENCE PELTZ Fair enough. Good. Good. Anybody else? 

01:07:00
[sil.] 

01:07:05
UNKNOWN Since it's something I wanted to change, I've always viewed it, can just be myself. You know, you think of it negatively, so I never really offered myself the opportunity to think what am I getting out of this. And so that was kind of… 

01:07:15
LAWRENCE PELTZ And what do you get out of it? 

01:07:15
UNKNOWN Umm… I get, umm… I actually get to slow down and not umm… get things done. Because you know, and maybe I just don't know how else to like stop myself from being a taskmaster. 

01:07:35
LAWRENCE PELTZ Right. So is this like a procrastination tendency or something? 

01:07:35
UNKNOWN No, it's having drinks, you know, like (inaudible), you know, it's like I could probably pick something else to do but it's like, it… it will slow me down, it allows me to engage with another person and I'm doing… but I'm still doing something, so it's like I always have to be doing something. 

01:07:55
LAWRENCE PELTZ You know there's a certain benefit in that, isn't it? 

01:07:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:07:55
LAWRENCE PELTZ So why do you think about changing that now? 

01:08:00
UNKNOWN I don't know because I could be getting something else then… Yeah… 

01:08:05
LAWRENCE PELTZ So the time… your time ultimately… this a good experience but your time ultimately isn't as well spent as you would… as you like… 

01:08:10
UNKNOWN That's yes, exactly. 

01:08:10
LAWRENCE PELTZ Okay. All right. Yeah, I mean, I didn't drink a lot, but I smoke pot and it umm… I was a tightly wound kid, I mean, I had a good sense of humor but nobody ever would have thought I was funny until I smoke pot because I just relaxed it away and it opened… opened up… opened up life in a new way. 

01:08:30
UNKNOWN Little more joyful, you know, in that moment then normally if you're kinda rigid, you know, it's like. Yeah, it's fun. 

01:08:35
LAWRENCE PELTZ That's right. That's right. So we don't do these things for no reason and then at some point it didn't work for me, so I stopped doing it. All right. Yes? 

01:08:45
UNKNOWN My habit is swearing a little bit and my judgment around it was that it's unconscious because I'm attached in the moment to an outcome and then I… you know, what the insight and the insight that I got from the process was that it also releases steam. 

01:09:05
LAWRENCE PELTZ It also what? 

01:09:05
UNKNOWN Releases steam. 

01:09:05
LAWRENCE PELTZ Yes. 

01:09:10
UNKNOWN Or just it's an expression of frustration or anger in the moment. And yeah, what I saw is that I got mad afterwards because I realize that I've gone on conscious, because whatever I was doing rather than flowing with it in the moment and the next moment comes along, I have… I've… I'm critical, you know, like I did it wrong… 

01:09:30
LAWRENCE PELTZ Critical of yourself. 

01:09:30
UNKNOWN Instead of, like I'm putting a pot on the stove and instead of going on the stove, it goes on the floor and I go, oh, you know. And rather than just going, oh, fascinating, it's on the floor now. So… so I guess the gift of it was just the process was to realize that I do need to release steam and I could do it differently by maybe just blowing out air or something I could… 

01:10:00
LAWRENCE PELTZ What? I haven't asked anyone else this but what would be difficult about not swearing when you're disappointed, uh… I mean, I'm… I'm saying disappointed because I have tended a lot to get disappointed than angry. I have through my practice., so I saw that, "Oh God, I get disappointed first." They never notice that where I get afraid first or I get umm… confused first. I didn't notice that until I slowed down enough to see it. So you say you spill something and I'm guessing disappointment, but then you get angry… 

01:10:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:10:30
LAWRENCE PELTZ And so if you stop doing that what would you miss? 

01:10:35
[sil.] 

01:10:40
UNKNOWN Well, I don't know nothing's coming up in the moment. I'm just going back to the exercise itself when I was doing exercise and I felt like it was a release. 

01:10:50
LAWRENCE PELTZ Yes. 

01:10:50
UNKNOWN You know, so if I didn't do that the swearing, I think I would miss the release. 

01:10:55
LAWRENCE PELTZ You'd miss the release. That's right. 

01:10:55
UNKNOWN But it could be… 

01:11:00
LAWRENCE PELTZ Likely that's true. 

01:11:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:11:00
LAWRENCE PELTZ Likely that's true, and probably a little more too, but this is… this is really important. So umm… we don't do the thing, and… and you see, you're the moment of compassion for, "Oh, that's why I do that," right. And I could tell any number of stories about I don't know you, of course, but you know, you're not, you know, little girls are taught not to talk that women aren't supposed to… It's like, "Well, fuck you. You know, I'm tired of this bullshit, you know." So it's something good about that, that you… you kind of say, no, sorry, too bad. I'll be who I want. Right. So you uh… and there's something empowering about it and then but on the other side, you start feeling like, "Well, maybe I could do a little better or maybe I… maybe or you might notice that it has some reverberations inside." Yeah, that's aren't so pleasant. Yes? 

01:11:45
UNKNOWN I'm thinking about my habit, it just brought up, umm… it helped me by feeling more honest and it increased my awareness and it also helped me to feel balanced because some of these things, as I was thinking about every side of the issue, uh… instead of putting those things asleep and suppressing them, not thinking about it and just being real big on one side, it just brought it all together, so I'm looking at it just in a balanced way. 

01:12:25
LAWRENCE PELTZ Good. Beautiful. Yes, so it's… it's… I think some self-knowledge isn't good news, a lot of it actually, but… but a lot of it… we… a lot of we hammer ourselves around these things. So… so what was the quadrant that you particularly that helped to open it up for you? That helped you to feel like, "Oh, this isn't. I'm not as bad as I thought, or I can see this in a broader way," or with any one particular? 

01:12:50
UNKNOWN It was the just the umm… the suffering side of it that I tend to just overlook. But then when I bring it up, I was saying, "No, I don't have to… to deal with the suffering side of it. And it's… it's also not good for me. It's not a good choice. 

01:13:10
LAWRENCE PELTZ So did you… you saw it that how much you are suffering. 

01:13:15
UNKNOWN Uh… I was able to focus on it because sometimes I look at one side, I think oh this is… this is healthy, this is unhealthy. This is good, this is bad, but I don't think of it all together. I… I usually think about one thing or the other. So… umm… so looking at it altogether… the healthy thing for me to do is to make… 

01:13:40
LAWRENCE PELTZ Great. Well, this… it limits the ping-ponging. That's right. That is… it… it's all exists at the same time. So thank you all. So let me say a little bit, you know, your question of let me sort of explicate this a little bit more. Did the examples help you at all? Yeah. See. The umm… way I line it up is I put on the left, you've got what's good about the habit and what's bad about letting go of the habit, on the right, the reverse. What's bad about the habit and what's good about letting go of the habit. Now what's good about the habit, I call it the quadrant of escape is that we get we get… we get a feeling, we get rid of a feeling or we… we get… we just see later. Right. What's bad about letting go of the habit is that we have to face it somehow, we have to feel it somehow, face our lives, face our feelings, right. Umm… Now on the other side, what's bad about the habit is that things go bad, you know, everything. Your relationships, money, work, uh… our health, uh… get, you know, thrown in the slammer or wind up dead, right. Well, that's not suffering, that's dead. All right. But umm… but uh… and what's good about being sober or letting go, it tends to be the flip side, those things tend to go better. All right. So on the right side of that, you get a life that works better. On the left side, what you get is a chance to tweak your feelings, illusion that you can control life, which, of course, we really can't, but… but we're, you know, these quadrants are all different universes. It's very good for parts work too because when you're in a quadrant, I think with some of the… I see hints, hearing hints of it. People… it goes particularly hearing with yours that is if you get trapped in a quadrant or you go back and forth between two, you're in a very limited reality or you're… you're very attached to one side of it or another or one… one piece of it, but if you open it up, well, then you see, "Oh, wow, a much more complicated than that." I have different pie of wholesome parts, I've unwholesome parts. Some of us are very attached to being wholesome or special. That's another… I have a patient that's his thing is special and ordinary and I… I was very attached to special but I'll tell you ordinary is fabulous. It's such a relief. It's… it's like being a human being, all right. Uh… Special has plus and minuses and has… and the ordinary has plus and minuses. Fill out those boxes, you'll see, you know, how you wanna live, right. The other thing about this is that, you see, umm… as… as you said, you see that you're not ready to change now. It's… it's very kind really. It's like, "Oh, I'm not a loser or I'm not… I'm just not ready," and just, or "Well, you see, I'm getting so much. I can't do it." So the… so you get a life where you get to escape now, the quadrants. If you escape, you suffer. But if you take responsibility, it's two words together, response ability. If you actually take charge of your life, then you have to paint. So this is like truth in advertising. All right. It's not easy. It's not easy. Yes? 

01:17:00
UNKNOWN I just wanted to understand why you use this… you didn't use this suffering both types but you know, the distinction between… 

01:17:10
LAWRENCE PELTZ Well, that's… that's… that's a very important distinction. I said before in the cartoon, umm… the guy in the car was suffering, Bob was suffering, all right. What's the difference between pain and suffering, anybody? 

01:17:25
UNKNOWN Pain is not optional. Suffering is. 

01:17:25
LAWRENCE PELTZ Correct. Yes. And umm… does everyone understand that. Yeah. Pain is inevitable. Misery optional, or suffering optional, right. So pain is… let me give you a working definition. Pain is unpleasant and/or it hurts, somewhere in there. Suffering is… I want it to be different suffering is the reactivity to pain. Let me… get me out of here. I can't stand this. It must be different. I won't accept this, that suffering, all right. So there's a continuum, unpleasant, it hurts, I don't like it and I want it to be different, that's a continuum. I don't like it is kind of in between because it's natural and something's unpleasant that we don't like it. The question is how attached we are to not liking it, how it must be different. If we don't like something and it doesn't have to be different, well, then I would say not everyone would agree me that Buddhist scholars disagree on this, but you get… everyone get the idea? If something can be unpleasant or it hurts but you… you're not invested. You don't like it but it's not invested in changing it, that's pain. All right, but as soon as you want to get rid of it, or you're reacting, or you're angry about it, that's suffering. Okay. So… so anyway, that's a critical difference. The key… the key quadrant is the one in the lower left. The quadrant of pain because that's why people don't get well because they can't take the pain, once they can take the pain, then they don't have to run away anymore. They can kind of embrace it, hold it, dance with it, you don't have to be in… in it. You know, the practice that we do here and I think the sort of illustrative, I think the two exercises we did… you don't have to be in it all the time, you can distract from it. If you just… if you go to the breath, or if you go to your touch points, or if you go to a pleasant sensation, or if you go to walking, that's… there's an element of distraction there, or you go to listening to music or watching TV or taking a shower, you notice the police never come to your house, you know, this is like, okay. This is… this is skillful. All right. So umm… you… But also learning how to be with pain is… is… is really important as well and we may have a chance to illustrate that although it's… let's see. So you know, here's… and you know, this is just a couple of more examples. Procrastination, you know, it's kind of like, umm… this was… this comes from a psychology graduate student. I treated, when he procrastinated, he wasn't worried, he was in a comfort zone, umm… he avoided his fears totally and he… he enjoyed it. He said, "I really don't like TV but when I'm procrastinating, I love it." It was like a free space for him. Right. But then the downside was he started have more problems. He… he actually got a zero on something, he didn't turn in and then he became worse, he became more upset and then facing the problem, he's… he's… This is the adulthood, umm… you know, to paraphrase Neil Sedaka, you know, growing up it's hard to do, you know. It's not for everyone. The bottom part is about growing up so that you deal with your fears, you… He's likely to do better because he's actually showing up and he feels better about himself all right, and then… but then the downside of that is that he loses his refugee, he looses his sense of being special and then he's gotta really be afraid of failure and success and failure, right. Yes? 

01:21:30
UNKNOWN So the idea is you kinda like put all (inaudible) I assumed, it's like, uh… kind of a (inaudible) you have to regret, you made (inaudible)… and I'm assuming, you're saying, okay, well, this is the problem here, and there has to be some sort of solution for each of those… 

01:21:55
LAWRENCE PELTZ Well, yeah. I mean, that's a good question. I… I find it's pretty seamless. Once people go through this and… and if you do it a few times with people, it'll just start making sense to you that this is a very human thing. So once you begin, once people begin to fill in those boxes, they see the complexity of it and you can just say to them, what you learn from that, just like I asked you all. What you'll… and the… the client will tell you, what the… what their concern is. They'll… they'll move you in the right direction of what to focus on. They may be having difficulty letting go of the benefit of it or they may be a lot of times they're afraid of the pain of it, you know, and were afraid of growing up and taking responsibility so I think that will orient the work. I don't know this (inaudible) any answer, not quite? 

01:22:45
UNKNOWN I mean, I just feel like okay with that (inaudible)… but it seems like in order to actually make the habit change, you've got a address all the things that are… 

01:23:00
LAWRENCE PELTZ Right. Well, what kind of a model do you work in? What kind of a… 

01:23:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible)… 

01:23:10
LAWRENCE PELTZ Right. Well, that's always hard or yeah. Absolutely, yeah. If someone else what? 

01:23:20
UNKNOWN Some else can control my food instead of me. 

01:23:20
LAWRENCE PELTZ Yeah. Well, you know, we… we don't become therapists for no reason I've noticed, you know, but so… If… Say, for example, gestalt has some parts element to it, right. I'm not trained in that. Well, these are parts, these are like parts. So you might identify the part that wants… that does the habit, it could be food, sex, drugs, rock and roll or whatever it is, religion, whatever the problem is, the relationship issue and the one that's attached to the habit, well, that's a part. Right. That it's a protector, it sort of control something. So you will learn about that, I don't know how you work and gestalt but if you're doing, other (inaudible) or IFS, you would learn about that part, you'd be kind to it. See, a lot of what we're doing is, I mean, mindfulness is about compassion. 

01:24:15
UNKNOWN But we have a sensation and then you immediately heard all that (inaudible)… 

01:24:30
LAWRENCE PELTZ Right, right. So then you would… you'd be… you'd help the person to be kind about that, you'd say, "Well, what do you get out of…" say it is eating, this is not uncommon. Well, then they'd say, "Well, God, I feel so much better. I love the feeling of being full, light," whatever it is. You say, "Well, God, that makes sense to me," or so you could… you could do it in any number of ways but if you could or work with the part that's trying to protect someone from a difficult feelings and just acknowledge that and then it may bring some of that to the surface that then can be worked with. Once you… once you acknowledge that will then the… things start opening up, you know, the downside starts looking a lot worse. There's more of a, you know, it's interesting… this thing… there's arrows going this way and this way, but they also go like this. The reason we escape is because of the pain. So you could have an arrow going that way, that's why we escape and then when we suffer enough, we umm… were moved to something when people come into treatment, you know, then they're moved to… I gotta get my act together. So umm… yeah, so that's… so yeah, I mean, this would be… this would be another workshop where we looked at various types of work. But thank you for the question, you know, it's… I hope that helps a little bit. All right. So yeah, one more, the inner critic. Right. This was one we have a lot of inner critics were we all have one, umm… I did this with patients, not too long ago. Umm… This woman was felt, she was underperforming, she was depressed and her inner critic says, so what's good about your inner critic, well, inner critic holds the promise that we could be better. Right. It increases our motivation with less vulnerable in critic… inner critic is or the inner tyrant is harsh and we have high standards, etcetera. The downside is that it wears us down, we wind up not trusting ourselves, feeling worse about ourselves and one of the points… one of these people made is that it attracts negativity, negativity attracts negativity. All right. So if we're compassionate, we feel better, umm… people treat you better, but then self-compassion has fears in it. You know, I could… you know, it's like these inner critics are just waiting for your affirmations. So I'm a… I'm a nice person. I'm a kind person, your inner critic is waiting and saying, yeah, right. Make my day. You know, it's kind of like, it's gonna nail you and so getting rid of that make leaves, you're very vulnerable, you're suddenly… If you… if you're compassionate, you then vulnerable to other attacks and feeling like you're… you're undeserving. People don't feel deserving so, anyway. 

01:27:25
UNKNOWN One minute. 

01:27:25
LAWRENCE PELTZ We're just about done? Okay. All right. Okay. So one of my patients, (inaudible) you get a gift from people and this is… this woman, she was an alcoholic, I said, "What's good about your habit? What's good about drinking?" She says, "Eases the pain." "What's bad about drinking?" "It creates pain." "What's good about being sober?" "You can deal with pain," and "What's bad about being sober?" "It hurts." Right. So yeah. All right. So yeah, yeah. This is another exercise, we don't have time for but this is more about being with pain. This is called Making Space. Notice it, you can coordinate it with the breath, breathe into it, bring acceptance and that… that's a question. Can I make space for this? This anger. Can I make space for this fear? Uh… And then, allow that, whatever it is. Right. And then go through the cycle and number of times. And… and notice how you're relating to it. Okay. All right. Any final thoughts? Yes? 

01:28:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible)… 

01:28:35
UNKNOWN Oh, okay. This is… you can coordinate that's like Foursquare breathing, inhale to a count of four, like it start it number two, inhale to a count of four, you notice the thing, you inhale to a count of four, then when the acceptance step, you can hold to a count of four, ask yourself the question, then, the allow, exhale to a count of for just and then… then again you might or exhale to a count of eight, then… then you're gonna notice again. So you'd… you'd notice it and then you inhale to, so it's a nice way of coordinating the breath with the… Yes? 

01:29:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible)… 

01:29:20
LAWRENCE PELTZ Yes. So then… so then what are you asking about it? That what about… what he's saying about worry. 

01:29:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible)… 

01:29:35
LAWRENCE PELTZ Yes? 

01:29:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible)… 

01:29:45
LAWRENCE PELTZ Yes. we don't think of worry is good but it is good and… and it would be instead of people just feeling bad about it, ask what do you get out of that, and how does that help you. Yeah, it often helps us feel like a better person or like we're responsible in some way and then… and then you can make some positive comments about that, about that you… you really want to do well by your kids and your… your good parent, you know, that kind of thing. All right you all. Thank you very much for your attention, your participation. Thank you, thank you so much.
