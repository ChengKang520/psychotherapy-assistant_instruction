RICHARD HILL The Brain. What's it got to do with it? Isn’t it fascinating that we actually have an entire profession that conducts a series of phrases something like what is it go depending on how you do your count somewhere between 168 and 324 different therapies. We heal people, we work with people, we deal with people, but we actually don't formally need to know anything about the organ we treat, which is quite interesting and Dan Siegel does this all the time. He is, so interpersonal neurobiology is one of my ah… ah… areas that I'm mentored in with Dan and he does this is really not in your formal studies, so in the formal studies, not in your enthusiastic desire for knowledge and information afterwards. Ah… how many of you had a semester on the brain. And is pretty much like that about three or four or five. Umm… the other interesting thing is how many of you had a semester on mental health? Quite a few, which is really good, distinguished from mental illness. Everybody, yeah. Mental illness, we get a lot of stuff about. Mental health, we don't get so much about. And of course, the solution oriented type of therapies are about that process. Ah, and it is generally the way I work, what I, I actually call it creative constructionism. Ah, because I believe if you're going to be intellectual, you need to invent terms that nobody knows what they mean. And then you get paid to explain them. And people get to the end of it and say "I knew that." So we just sort of battle on as we go. But the essence of what we're doing and what I will talk about in this is there will be notes that you can taken that will be explanatory aspects of it. But I will also be introducing an enormous num umm… different types of knowledge, different areas of expertise. So which, you know we could see it and explain each one of them, but that would be a lecture in itself. But the essence of it is nothing is about the therapy, nothing is about the theory, nothing is about the ah… the academic research everything is about the most unusual and interesting thing that you've in your rooms when you are working and that's the client, Interestingly enough as sort of the side light, you're another one. So which the interaction between these two human beings that is what it is all about and in fact, we know from research that it doesn’t matter what therapy you use if you don't have a good relationship between the counselor and the client, you don't have anything. And in fact, sometimes if I don't know how many of you have this experience, but people actually ring up and make an appointment, and then ring up three days later and say "I actually feel much better now." Simply opening themselves up to the possibility of something going on and will be seeing some stuff on play in the next group, which is just so exciting. Just letting things happen, makes things happen and that's the way we're doing in our genetic works. Ah… do, what're we talking about? ha…ha… that thing. Has anyone ever see being to a wet lab or seen a film of a "well done, well done, I had to go to for". The first one I saw like that, the second one I saw like that, and the third one I mean oh! gee that's interesting except when I pulled it out of the skull in it, I said turn off the sound effects and "Oh dear." Anyway, but I was also one of those woozy boys in high schools who couldn't stand rect(ph) being dissected or the eyeballs being dissected largely, because the girls liked you more. I'd could never understand why boys didn't go into we’re acting, because that's where all the girls were. So this is the thing that we… that we… did, that's it, that's all the standup comedy for now. I will tell you really (inaudible ) before. That this is the thing we didn't and it’s devilishly complicated and complex. So we kind of done pay any attention to it at all and we can't avoid it and what we do is we work with the thing that emerges at the very end of all the processes, which is behavior. And it’s a good place to go. But it is interesting and quite fascinating that now we're beginning to understand what this thing does and what this thing is all about. We were actually finding that we can get a clearer idea about these aspects of behavior and sometimes a single behavior may have three or four different elements of activity going on in the neuroscience of what's going on. So strangely enough, the more you know, the better you are at something. So that's why we're now into neuroscience, ah… but really the reason were into neuroscience is this thing we know stuff. Ah… one of the good thing is that one of the Bush's did in the 1990s was do that from all the other things, was declared the decade of the brain that was in 1990s and so we did more research and gained more knowledge about the brain in that 10 or 15 years after that. Then, we have ever before and I would think if we were talking about what the decade of the whatever in the notice or whatever it is were in. It’s the decade of the mind. So we will talk about that as well as what we’re going on. But just as a quick sort of go in. We will just have a little look at the mechanics. And I think this is interesting in the context that a lot of this for me is informed. I… I… I had the great good sense six years ago to marry a woman who is also a remedial massage therapist and a nurse, and a health scientist and so I married 40 years of knowledge about the body, which I could never learn in probably the 8 years, so it’s really handy. But what we have in at a massage therapy conference is someone will get up and talk about one of x dozens of different types of therapies and they'll talk about the radial, medial, gumfo(ph) things that supraspinatus or all these difference, this is supraspinatus, but supraspinatus is the only way I can remember it. Then talk about the all these muscles and the people no matter what therapy they use, have a sense of understanding about what's going on. It’s a common language. That's what we don't have in psychotherapy and in counseling. And the brain perhaps is a place where we can have some of this common language. I mean, I could probably say to you now, something like ah… ah… the amygdala, ah… and a lot of you will go "Oh! Yes we were talking about emotional fears and things now". So that's really cool. So no matter what therapy I'm doing. And so what we’re doing… is doing this therapy to calm the amygdala, and we have a conversation and but if I start saying ah… ah… we also wanted to… to calm down striatum and perhaps some actions in the basal ganglia particularly the putamen, but we're not sure about the globus pallidus, because that's interfering and interacting with the periaqueductal gray and I don't know that's really good because we imply, ah… we and zzzzzhhh do you mind. So let’s just start of with just a little bit of a cooks to off the engine and because that's kind a what we think it is. This fabulous supercharged human beings we have got it uffffffffff off we go, aren’t we fantastic and actually there is some really, really good books, which say "Sorry it's the most stupid cobbled together piece of gobbledygook I’ve ever seen in my experience and however was in charge of this should be taken out and slept", but strangely it works. And I guess the best way to describe the evolutionary process of the brain. It’s a bit like coming along now with all the knowledge we have and say we can make a porch. We can make a brain like that, that's fantastic. And they said, Yes we want you to do that, but actually what we wanted to do unfortunately is we want all aspects of modality before we kept in there. And maybe we will keep utilizing them occasionally when we feel like it. So this is why it gets difficult. Because, we can be going along very merely in the modern developments of the brain and suddenly it flips and it goes off somewhere and it starts behaving like modality ford(ph) and we go "Bhoo! what happened here? We’re now beginning to understand what that is. So cooks(ph) to of these thing, "Oh! Lord they have so many bits I not even know half of the bits." Ah… I keep reading these papers you know how to use abbreviations for the long terms, and then you have to spend your entire life looking back through the paper to find what I said at first, and when you find words said at first and you guess what does that mean. And you say well, I’ll just say the abbreviation. But what we have is a very simple system that emerges out of our bodies through the spinal cord up into an area in here the brain stem and then fills out into that area of there. Before I go through this, let's just do the simple version. And we’ll just do it with the hand, gained from my good friend Dan Siegel and we have the brainstem coming up and we go up into the midbrain area, which does lot of automatic behaviors keeps us breathing and our heart beating and various useful things like that. And then, we develop what we call the, the higher midbrain area that things like your amygdala some of these emotional process of the limbic area, some of these things, and then we falled over it this fabulous thing called the cortex, which is a new thing and there you are, you've the brain in the hand and kinda technically it’s kinda like that. Ah… well we’ve two of them, but it’s really difficult to do anything then, because you've to keep looking around it. So you just do it like that. And as we will talk about later on this area here we modified(ph) prefrontal cortex this part of your executive brain what happens with most of their clients and most of their times when we've the most stressful things and we go historical road rate, well of course, we just flip our lids and all these starts acting. So let's have a look at what some of these are? Just we want to spend a lot of times. This is a, it's not a… a… biology lecture, but we’ll start with this guy. So here we go we come up yes, and then we have this area of the, of the mid brain up… of the brain stem moving off into this midbrain area here. This is all the area here that sort of came along and gave us a lot of our emotional behavioral sort of stuff, the stuff that happens automatically. We have here hippocampus where we have our dealings with working memory where we have our dealings with, with memory processing. Ah, this area here the amygdala you've heard about, I love it what's amygdala just means almond, so I don't know, they call it some Greek name and we said there is, isn't that clever? But now it’s just almond, coz guess what shaped like an almond, it’s so imaginative. Umm… Brodmann on the other hand who, who tested a lot of parts all around and just numbered them and that was interesting. He didn't even go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5… he went 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6…, 23, 28, 47, 53 to 19 so it’s the system itself hasn't even grown really methodically. So it is tricky, but we come up and we've our brain stem, we go into these areas, there is the hippocampus we all know, there is amygdala and we've all heard of the HPA axis the Hypothalamus Pituitary Adrenal axis where we have all the stress. It's just that little fellow there, there is the hypothalamus. He does an awful lot for a little fellow and it is. The hypothalamus is really the moderator of the automatic processes. This little guy, there is the pituitary considered a gland. It’s sort sticks out of the brain umm… although that actually sticks half in and half out. So that's actually not considered the part of the brain. The pituitary is actually gland, but it’s sort of hangs around. Ah… we have these areas within, now there is the thalamus, the blue guy in there, so, he is not deep there. Your thalamus is your inter-connector that's the… that's sort of the… the roundabout of, of the body. So you have all this information coming up into the thalamus, which then sense it out all over the place and vice versa the stuff comes back into the thalamus and then it sent back into the body of, been to the hypothalamus and so on and so forth. These areas here, you might have heard of the basal ganglia. You might heard of the basal ganglia in, in reference to things like some of the, the illness like Parkinson's and some of the illness. It’s full of all kinds of stuff. There is ah… lots of nuclei. There are nuclei all over the place. Ah, that do things, but the basal ganglia that, that area that’s really interesting to us is this area in here called caudate and this area in here called the striatum. And you can see why it’s called the striatum, again just fairly creative sort of stuff. Very much to do that area, which is called of out for your automatic behaviors. So things like OCD occupation… you know the thing Obsessive Compulsive Disorder come from a mix up going on in there. A dissociation, a disconnection that is going on. In here, you, you’ve actually got your, your corpus callosum that's they’ve left that out their, because they don't wanna show that. This one here is called the cingulate, unbelievably busy little fellow and as you can see he is all out(ph) cortex, all out(ph) of cortex all our clever thinking modern brain, here is all out(ph) in a emotive automatic imprinted stuff and this guy kinda gets in between them and it’s a bit of the chat between them, so when we've our cortex, it chats in and particularly through the frontal area, through this, this frontal area here. So you might of heard and seen the ACC Anterior Cingulate Cortex and everyone talking about the ACC is helping us to assist social structures, helping us to assist our sense of individuality, helping us to as it goes on and on and on. It's a very busy intel(ph) player between this out a lot. So the out a lot divided out really into these four sections, so we have your, your, your frontal, we have your parietal, your temporal and your occipital. And that's basically your… your… your frontal for regulating activity, your parietal for movement and sensorial aspects, your umm… the auditory ah… and temporal auditory and memory and some degree language and then we have here of course the visual cortex. What's interesting is your senses, the actually sensory information that comes up from your body is only registered in about 30% of the cortex. The other 70% of the cortex, its job is to associate. Now we're starting to understand how the brain works because disassociation is what we very often deal with… with our clients. We’ve got to get this aspect of your life or of your experience in connection with another aspect of your life or experience in order for you to become better to get beneficial change for your situation. So what we're doing is integrating, a disintegrated set of… set of brain processes. So if I for whatever reason, are able to disconnect the good flow of energy ah… that occurs between that automatic behavior system and actually it's the ah… it’s this area here the orbital prefrontal, but I don't want about that, but so the, the, the prefrontal area talks to the… to the this striatum and if the system gets messed up that's when you end up with OCD. So what do you do fix the OCD? No, but yes, what we do now from the brain point of view, from the neuroscience point of view is we try and reintegrate the areas that have got marked up and we try and find how to fix that. You want to know if you deal with OCD, Jeffrey Schwartz. So you go and look at J… Jeffrey with a J, S Schwartz and look him up on the web, he is the guy that is the guy, so look his stuff up we won't go because it, as I say he is in an enormous area and he describes then having explained the brain processes what the four or five simple processes ah… that can help us do that and why immersion therapy may or may not be the best way to go depending on your client. As I say, this lecture should give you about six months of work to do. Ah, because if I explain to you everything I know, I would either take up too much of the time or I would have to kill you, because then your competition. Ah, I know it's really hard, it’s really hard every time I learn something I could see one of my mentor was going "Oh you know that now, do you? Hmm, what a shame. So at this point and we can do all along the way, you're very welcome to ask your question, just pop a hand up so in case I’m on a role and any questions you want to ask, this is just a basic in the card. There is a card (inaudible ) there is the thing. Anything at this point? Oh! yes one. 

00:18:40
(inaudible ) with the same life? 

00:18:45
RICHARD HILL Ah, neurobio feedback. Now, this is a… I will get into it bit more, but neurobio feedback is the thing that is the magic of it all that we are really doing is that not only do you have your biology coming up and going to thalamus and telling everybody else what's going on, you know what I'm touching, what I'm eating, what I'm feeling, what I'm hearing so on and so forth. What we have is this extraordinary understanding that if you actually think something that it goes back down and goes back up in the body and actually alters the body so we have not only body up processing, but we've brain down processing, so neurobio feedback is the capacity for us to take a thinking process and change the body. Now is there any here now in audience even now after only 10 years I’ve really been thinking about this we sort of go okay, but 10, 15 years ago you say that in an audience you can think something and your body will change and after you've collected over glasses and beer cans and booze and jeers you sort of slink off stage and go back home and do another research project. This is so new in the context of, of thinking, but that's… we'll do a bit more of that in a minute. Let's go on then. 

00:20:00
Two Communities Left Serial Linear Past-future Attention to detail assessments Language I Right parallel present Pictures Learns kinesthetically Sensorial reality creativity WE 

00:20:05
RICHARD HILL This is something that is an example of what we do and what we actually have to kinda keep doing but stop doing. The two communities left side, right side. Now broadly, I can divide these things up and I can say okay the left side. It is more of the serial side, it's the thing that Jill Bolte Taylor in her TED talk, if anyone seen that talk by ted.com everybody go in there and go bananas. If you haven't been in there yet everybody who's anybody talking about anything is on there for free so ted.com. Jill Bolte Taylor saying that the left brain is about details and details of the details and the details of the details of the details and the details of those details. Just be sure you’re detailed enough they’ll do tell up one more time. But it's serial and linear and it works in that course(ph) of way and it enables us to look at the past and the future so it gives us those that's where we assess a lot of that memory. Attention to details you say, makes assessments in language is one of its important processes. We have quite a lot of the language we’ll call Wernicke's to Broca's (inaudible ) and the muscular systems of the motor cortex operating on the left-hand side for language (inaudible ) goovy. So then we have clearly much-much further away and as we can tell by all the green and people seeming to have some much more fun, the right side is a much to be better place to be and I say that with my tongue and my cheek for the moments so don’t write that one down. But here we have more parallel where thinking and process are thought of as happening at the same time. It's more about the present, it's more about pictures and music and sound and symbols we learn kinesthetically so it's very much more about our sensory motor behavior and what's going on. And creativity seems to occur more in there. We definitely have a sense in the left-hand side of the I and in the right hand side we have the WE. So here we are a divided thing again please. 

00:22:20
This for everybody that's which we hear about left and right brain you know, that there are some people, who would be right brain to… 

00:22:30
RICHARD HILL Good, and that's exactly what (inaudible ) and your, your thing to say just a minute, well we're all just divided up and separate and think, no not at all. Broadly though answering your question is this for everybody, yes broadly. Do individuals alter their brain in such a way depending on their experience neurobio feedback? Yes, what is the greatest neurobio feedback that we experience every single moment of our lives. It is called experience and your brain's job at the early stages after about the first 18 months when it sort of got itself a bit together. Basically, the entire job of the brain is to built itself, because it is not built by any stretch of the imagination in fact, it doesn't stop building itself until potentially well into our 20s, but certainly well into our late teens. So experience determines which parts of your brain grow, which parts of brain connect, what then you will be able to, to then behave like in your, ah.. in your life. Ain't that cool? That's so cool. And that's why the genetics thing is so interesting, because that goes even deeper. So what has happened in human being, because not all the species do this, this differentiation of, of activities. Human begins have overtime through the experience of their species found that by differentiating these activities, we are able to more effectively enact them. And what we do is we produce a very big massive connecting system called the corpus callosum that connects and allows these two systems to connect each other and chat with each other. What we do in our culture which is the annoying thing beyond measure is we over stimulate this side through our education system, so if you over stimulate, you over experience it(ph) I just made that up I’m a linguist, I’m allowed to. If you're over experience it(ph) this side of the… of the brain what is the brain going to do. It is going to create itself more dominantly in that experience. So why that people have more dominant left sides than right sides, because we have a more dominant left side then right side experience. If you have a more dominant right side to left side experience then you'll have more dominant right side and so if you… and there are people that we have inherit that, that situation for example in the broadest extent we have these occasional children we come across that have been raised animals. They have no language, they have no lots of other aspects and interestingly when they are really right brained they're particularly concerned with the present, they're very survival oriented and they're very quick to budge your head off. The whole thing right brain is good, left brain is bad, pick up that book tear it up, burn it, send it elsewhere, mail it off to someone you don't like, anything at all, it is not true. These two systems assist each other to produce a coherent experience. A expression of the, of experience and the more you connect these two guys and you operate in an integrated fashion. The more you generate experience around yourself that then reflectively neurobio feedback or psychosocial feedback balances the two. The more balanced you are the more balanced you are, the more imbalanced you are, the more imbalanced you become. Hence, I've got an idea we should create a profession whether our people who actually act as a third party for people to help them, find an integral oh that’s right that’s we’ve got counselors and psychotherapist excellent. Oh! Keep doing what you're doing. Very good. Now, of course in the village which are sadly we no longer have because we need to ah… ah… really maintain but, but there is too many of us basically, Robin Dunbar if anybody wants to read that work I mean a great book its to 90s now, but language, Gossip Grooming and the Invention of Language. We’ll talk to you about how our capacity to have a larger group size was a part of that species but our natural group size, meaning a group size where we all know each other and we don’t have to write anything down is about a 150 to 200. You start to go beyond that and you actually have to start organizing in an external fashion and basically when you start having to organize in an external fashion what do you do. Do you have 200 individuals? No. You begin to have an individual suitable expression and if your culture has an individual suitable expression which is the experience which is the psychosocial experience that is being happening to you what happens to the brains of the people in that culture. They mold themselves towards the individual expression. Gosh, we are kinda stop before start, aren't we? Not to worry that’s right the brain is plastic(ph) we can do it. So let's move along here. 

00:28:05
Mindset A process that regulates the flow of energy and information 

00:28:05
RICHARD HILL Mindset, this is so important. What is the mind? Has anybody had in their formal education anything on the mind? No. I can answer for you if you have yet. What on earth is it? Is it the brain acting, is it something that emerges from the brain, is it a thing where do you find it, can you put it under a microscope what do we do and the argument is still continuing. There are even those that suggest that mind should not be discussed at all despite the fact that they're discussing the mind and Dan often reports of going to conferences where they are talking about the mind and they say no the mind is something that we should not investigate it is something that and you think well then don't talk about it which is fine we'll talk about it in purely an hysteric way so there they we need a personal(ph) neurobiology we use a definition which kinda works. I think it works better than anything I've, I’ve actually come across. So the mind is a process that regulates the flow of energy and information. With this understanding that what is going on inside our heads is a flow of energy and information between the neurons, between the areas so there is, there is integrated flow whether there is disintegrated flow and this flow at any given time is the mindset that we are possessing at that time. So the mind is not so much a noun as a verb. So the mind is what is happening in the brain that enables it to flow in the way that it does. Tricky, I'll leave you to, to that my brain went into peculiar carbuncles for some weeks after I first heard that and kept going back to Dan’s lectures and kept listening and going I get it, a bit. It’s still a difficult concept, but if you could look up on it just as that since that the brain is the flow of energy information and the mind is the capacity, the processes, the emergent possibilities of that mechanism to flow and the mindset is the particular flow of energy and information that is occurring at that particular time. Cool! I can alter your mindset very quickly. Right now, I have you in a fairly left brain fairly moderated, occasionally panicky somewhat disturbed and a few sleepy bits off of mindset, I could suddenly go rather peculiarly pickup an axe and drivel and go… I’m gonna kill you and that might sense some of you into a different mindset some of you into the HPI access or fearfulness and others into hysterical laughter. Saying I don’t when I auditioned for Dan’s party as an actor many years ago, I’ve auditioned for the role, read the part of curly who was rather vulgar chap and I came off and my, my dear friend turned to me and said Richard do you know when you swear it’s just like somebody saying can I have a glass of milk. So ended playing up the naught guy, but that was right, I enjoyed that. So, this is what we do in our room. They come in freaked out mindset. We calm them we give him a, we use our rapport. We have a sense, we create a sense of safety so they weren’t safe it before. We create a new sense of safety, they change, their body changes, their facial expressions change, they change their mindset changes the flow of energy and information changes. Sadly, what they do is they go back out into the world and within 20 minutes they are back to where they were before they came in and I will explain that a little further down the track. We will skip through a little bit now, because there is so much to say, and we will just try and gather. 

00:32:10
Interpersonal neurobiology Integrating brain Coherent mind Empathetic relationships 

00:32:10
RICHARD HILL So in interpersonal neurobiology, this is the way we think about us this thing in the middle of the… of all these many processes. So we have a brain that requires integrating that went integrated is in its best state. We have that as a direct, a direct relationships to the process that it is… that is expressing so a coherent mind kinda have a integrated brain if your mindset is of the three and directly involved in all that is the stuff that comes in from the outside and particularly our relationships with ah… other living organisms as well as just the general expressions of things. Ah… I am known to be somewhat odd, because I talked to amenable(ph) object quite a lot, but anybody here find they do that they talk to rocks and trees and various things show your hands to make me feel better oh, look I am not nuts fantastic. I will cancel that therapy. The, was the thing, I despite (inaudible ) I talked to the trees and that’s why they put me away. So we have that a lot this interconnecting with the outside world. In our culture, can very often be thought of this odd, but what is it about us that tells us that we have an empathetic relationship with other people, because everybody I mean, the big thing now is you know, you are an individual you know, do your own thing make sure you are alright, look after number one, be special, get at their, all that stuff what is it? About any suggestions about what just actually screams out to us that we are not disconnected to other people but we are actually connected to them any suggestions, be brave get the right side going. So it is, yes… 

00:34:10
We have (inaudible ) 

00:34:11
RICHARD HILL We… we something happens and what… what are they doing? What are something of things that they are doing that we are mostly respond to. Yeah, but what are they actually doing? Just… just have a quick look someone is walking towards you. I am walking towards you facial expressions, what on earth is a use of facial expression to me? I just have a quick look. You cannot see your own facial expressions. The only reason we have facial expression is for ourselves to communicate to somebody else what is in here. To shift over space our mind, oh!! hi, these things, gestures, (inaudible ) just emotions which emerge out of is actually in a variety of forms and even in (inaudible ) and various other… other… other situations and so what we found is this thing mirror neurons. Just quick hands heard of mirror neurons some, okay. Quick explanation of mirror neurons. They are a set of neurons that would discovered inside our brain, which when we are observing somebody else's behavior. Fire as if we are doing that behavior ourselves so freaky, we do not emphatically appreciate somebody else's actions. We implicitly oh my god, its gone blizzard that is alright, I learned it oh that’s right anyway, we keep going, because I started in school. The um, what we have what I did was these guys with the latte(ph) and few other chaps, because I have to complete this round, because my mindset has been ruined and now right brain panicky and wondering why my mother isn’t here. The… the… the essence of what they did with the latte(ph) and team were checking for motor neurons in monkeys and so they had and I have difficulty with animals experiments, but anyway it is what it is and they had electrodes in there and I found a neuron that responded when the monkey lent forward and picked up a bit of food, a little bit of food and as Marco Iacoboni, I-A-C-A-B-O-N-I Marco Iacoboni that’s the next person to look up. Marco Iacoboni if you see like he talks about in his book mirroring people which is a great description of mirror neurons. The Italians are always hungry so at lunch time or one of the breaks one of the experiment is lent forward and ate some of the food while the monkey was all still wide up and that same mirror neuron that same neuron in his head fired slightly differently, but it had fired so that was the neuron that fired when the monkey did the action himself and it did it with it. It was so much of a bleep in the what they have were looking for they didn’t even write it in their notes it wasn’t until somebody and it was Fargozi(ph) one of the… the… the more pedantic members of the group who sat down and said now that was something that was an anomaly that was different. I thought that was an anomaly that was something different. You know, he said we must investigate it and so they went on and they did something and they started to find these whole expression that we have neurons in our brain, which they called mirror neuron just simply as a not clever anything clever just because it was mirrored what we are doing inside our head. So we actually feel what is going on inside us as if we were going it in the real fashion and here is the interesting thing about the brain. Neurons do not know the difference between reality processing and imagination processing. No idea of the difference. yes. 

00:38:20
You say about the of size of mirror neurons (inaudible ). 

00:38:26
RICHARD HILL Ah Yes, we were talking about copying and so on and so forth. We are not sure the, the research looking at babies is… is… is limited. The um, but it is assumed that it is a… a… a fundamental area that’s going on in babies as well, but it’s not so fundamental, because one of the things that’s terribly important about mirror neuron just not only they pickup the physically activity but certainly in human beings we are able to pickup the intension so a different mirror neuron will fire when you pickup something to eat it as when you pick it up to throw it away if people which is very interesting. So it is elemental in the human experience and it’s part of it. So it’s right here, we start of here in the inferior… inferior parietal area. So in the motor… motor cortex area and the motor cortex area ah… as well, which are quite well formed in… in babies so we are assuming that it’s quite strongly there. Remember the biggest problem with babies movement is the cerebellum, you know control of it so they actually have a quite lot of movement, but we are not really sure you know what’s the space. This is what exciting about all these stuff. It is like we do not know all together yet. 

00:39:45
(inaudible ). 

00:39:47
RICHARD HILL Yeah. So there is a… again we’re not sure. The degree to which they are implicated in the processes, because there is not lot of a… fMRI work done with babies. Um… because they have a habit of sort of moving, crying, getting a bit hysterical and really being very disobedient. But, but yeah so, so watch the space and the, the, the second thing to say is I haven't read that research so perhaps there is, but I haven't, I haven't read it. So as much as I would like to think I’ve read everything, but if I had read everything I would have read the other 200 papers that I have erased of my website the other day. Yeah… 

00:40:25
So if you are saying like there is four and these neuron thing stimulated does that happen more a lot quickly if (inaudible ) supposed in the same situation? 

00:40:40
RICHARD HILL No vicarious trauma is different thing that's more in your automatic areas, that's more in basal ganglia, it's more in your amygdala. So it's the emotional response to that, to that stimulation. So the Mirror Neurons are responding principally to other people. 

00:40:55
But if it was such a way, the situation was (inaudible )? 

00:40:57
RICHARD HILL Yes. 

00:40:57
And we’ll vary the time and you more likely to have the neurons triggered more deeply. 

00:41:00
RICHARD HILL Ah, yes. When you're sitting with your client and yes, you are sitting there feeling, so we have to be very mindful about A traumatizing ourselves, B then doing transference counter transference and re-traumatizing them from our trauma, ah… we also have situations Bonnie Badenoch in her book the Brain Wise Therapists puts this very nicely. Where she was dealing with someone who had child… childhood abuse. And which she had and was talking about it and she just sort of, she says I can remember my eyes just flicking for second as my experience flash through my, my head triggered by the Mirror Neuron empathy then triggering her own experience. And um… the client then claimed up, which she then investigated and said, but you, you flicked a sign of disapproval and disrespect to me. So they picked up so Mirror Neurons don't necessarily, unnecessarily right either, because once they go into the brain, they then came down we've seen it and we, we know this we’re going down here, what these areas getting around the brain. But then actually does going through the insular. We found in the insular, which for those you know your brain bits then gets into the limbic area then we get into the prefrontal cortex. And we are actually then casting our opinion on this experiences as well. So it's quite complex, but it’s just very simple if I do this, oh, fabulous. Various once you at there are going oh, I would mind one of those either and other ones when saying oh, I've had about 15 of those and I think he bit hurry up and stop speaking. So we get various comments, but what’s really interesting is if I do this, nothing happens at all. So intension is vital, so intension is vital. So I've given a bit of and I know it’s not enough, but over the next couple of days you can butt(ph) and hold me in a corner somewhere and and not let me out until I've explained it. But that’s the important things, the important thing in Mirror Neurons is to understand that we are not only visually and appreciably and empathetically connected to others through things like language, through things like facial expressions, and things like gesture. We are actually designed to biologically within neurobiologically co-experience what is going on around us. And that is why sometime you just can't look at something and did anyone see what was the well, Sandra Bullock in the film with the Blind Side or has anyone see that film. And the young boy said that his mother when she was doing drugs or what ever it was. She said close your baby and, and whatever intuitively brilliant actually saved that child from a reparable traumatic um… imprinting or very difficult to repair traumatic imprinting. And that’s what saved him, so I’m sitting there turning to my wife and saying oh, look that's really good, because she stopped mirror neuron and the mirror, she says shut up, watching film. She's, she's very good, she's found now that it five past six in the morning two minutes after the alarm gone off the discussion about the brain are acceptable. Is that a divorce, you know ah… but is this guy here…

Self monitoring Pre Frontal Cortex •Body regulation •Attuned Communication •Emotional balance •Response flexibility •Empathy •Insight •Fear modulation •Intuition •Morality Daniel Siegel The Mindful Brian 42-44 

00:44:35
RICHARD HILL …that is a lot to do with what is wrong that is the most integrated aspect of the brain. Principally, that’s all it does, in fact from this sort of part the brain back is very concrete and very related to sensorial process. This part of the brain forward is almost all about association and the abstract. And ah… the best way we can experience ah… say to someone what do u mean? It was like when you feel something abstract, you describe it in a concrete way, don’t you? And I go, what you mean? And you say ever heard of metaphor, so when we're try to understand the abstract, what do we do? Metaphor therapy. We use metaphors, we use narratives, we use all of these things to try and get them to get some concrete sense of the abstract perspective. Because as the, as the wonderful acupuncturist said when the man was wondering why he was putting nails in his foot frees, kidneys and his hand frees, brain. He said look all connected. That’s the thing we must remember, all connected, but can be disturbed and that’s our process. Ah… these are basically the, the run through of the things that we talk about, that Dan talks about in his book developing mind, ah… we’ve got at there couple of his, we’ve got the Mindful Therapist just come out, there are copies there. That you can order, they're very-very good. The mind, mind sight is a bit more for the general reader. But this guy here interacts with almost every other part of the brain. It sends out tendrils(ph) almost everywhere. It can help us think about body regulation, knowing that the body regulation processes go on in the deeper parts of the brain. A tuned communication that’s what we do here. It's the pre-frontal cortex that lights up when we make it communication that is a tune, that is connected, that is integrated as different from modern communication now which is eh, eh what’re you doing? Um… it’s 17 minutes past five and I’ve got oh bum, oh, I think that’s Facebook. I’ve learned all about that. I will tell you, I love it my son is getting there and I just whizzed down the page to try and find anything that's English. I am (inaudible ) but it is quite good but, my, my daughter, her page is actually very political, that is quite interesting and no one goes to it. The emotional balance, that thing of with this is the part of the brain, oh… go back this is the part of brain that we utilize that the pre-frontal cortex, the medial pre-frontal cortex particularly and its connection to the anterior cingulate that we were talking about. To calm down all those areas in the limbic area and the basal ganglia, just calm down and in fact we grow neurons. During therapy, down from our medial pre-frontal cortex to the amygdala, to actually and what’s called GABAergic neurons to actually connect with neurons in the amygdala to calm it down and that moment of pause and we need half a second, our emotional brain, our limbic area, or the automatic brain has got about a quarter to half a second it start on the interrupting brain, the, the regulating brain and the pre-fontal cortex. So all these wonderful techniques we use and by the one I use is that’s interesting if you just look at… that’s interesting. But the time you said that's interesting your brain has now kicked in and it's looking at processing it in a different way. Um… the response flexibility, so meaning ability to do this thing or that thing, as different from just the you know, the automatic response. Empathy seems to be working in the insight. It connects a lot with the areas that the insular and what's called the posterior cingulate cortex, which deals with lot of the individual. Fear modulation as I’m saying this wonderful thing of growing down connections to have fear centers to actually calm them down. Aren't they freaky, is not beautiful and in fact Bonnie describes it as the medial pre-fontal cortex, growing calming arms of, of a GABAergic neurons to quiet and comfort the amygdala in times of stress, so beautiful. Where… even this thing is beautiful. Intuition, not so much, I think you're going to go shopping on Wednesday, not so much that as intuitionally, the inner sense, that the information gathering the information from your heart and from your stomach and from all these other neuron mets(ph) that we’ve got going on in the vagus nerve and all these other bits and pieces. Ah… and that morality as well, which is really, really interesting. Those things are regulated from this, from this area and responded from there. So they are… that’s the executive brain, I say that too business people when I say that’s named after you, so why don’t you use it. Um… which, which the, the… and I think I could have given that one to a politician to take into the house. It to be, it’ll be excellent. I would like to thank the member from so and so for, for not using their pre-fontal cortex. Ah… lets just quickly hear, because I want to leave time for questions. Again, just reminding this imprinted memory, we have heard that term, you know that’s an imprinted memory. That’s is principally happen in here, in the little amygdala area. And the principal of the amygdala are based memory. As different from a cognitive memory that autobiographical memories, which really start, don't stop being laid down to about four or five. When we start getting theory of mind and we start developing our right side integration with left side appropriately. These experiences print themselves into the neurons of the amygdala, it’s a memory area. But it has no connection with the outside world with, with the communicative outside through language and as we have with that cognitive, when we have in that cognitive areas. And so when your amygdala fires that is where you have almost no control of, because we don’t know where it is coming from what’s doing, where it’s at. And we need to train people to understand that and the trouble with this whereas we can rewire, we can reframe with our capacity of neuroplasticity, we can reframe beliefs and ideas and conjectures. In the amygdala, it’s very-very difficult to almost impossible to remove that, ah… that neuron connection. What we need to do is we need to calm it, create alternatives and actually have over riders for it and this is why even when you do, people do recover from their traumas and from posttraumatic stress, symptoms. And in the simpler expression of it which is also in some of the phobias and so on and so forth that a trauma, 20 years later on can actually bring it all back on again. We can, we can rewire, the trouble is that there is so much of stuff going up in the brain, there are so many connections, there are so many capacities, that even though they can get very quiet and then almost some of them do actually get completely erase, they actually apoptosis they die. But mostly we just desensitize, because that anyone get then that then, then oh… that’s always the fun, I missed that, the number of neurons in the brain, that’s always cute, anyone want to tell, yes. 

00:52:35
More needs than the… what they call. 

00:52:40
More than the leaves of the Amazonian rainforest. 

00:52:45
RICHARD HILL Absolutely fantastic, so if you guys that type of two, type of four there, after the Amazon, now I want them counted by lunch time. It’s fantastic I was gonna, people say um… sort of like, a billion, you know lots. It’s a hundred billion, hundred billion neurons and each neurons potentially and on average has about a thousand to ten thousand synaptic connections to other neurons. So that’s a billion times, that’s a lot, that’s a lot. And what we have is we have neuronal pathways through the neurons and synapses that are strengthened by experience. Thank you, well done. By experience and repetition and that’s called long-term potentiation, if you seen those one of the thing LTP. We managed LTP with this patient, and you think oh, flip-back, flip-back, flip-back long-term potentiation. We have long term depression as well, LTD, that was so much fun it took me a lot more pages to find because that was only mentioned once. So we actually can depress neuronal pathway activity, very difficult to completely erase the, the capacity, because the brain doesn't need to, just makes more, it’s quite extraordinary. Ah… we'll go on, and this all saying about the automatic systems this area of the basal ganglia. Um… we want to say any more about that’s, that’s pretty much there I think and just information as, as, as we’re going. 

00:54:20
Automatic Systems Basal Ganglia 

00:54:20
RICHARD HILL Um… Just a quick one here which is really, really important. This area here, the anterior cingulate, which has got all kinds of fabulous activity. Two things to, to let you know the little space here, this little vein a bit there, it’s called the subgenual cingulate, it’s called Brodmann’s area 25 there are few things that does this. This little area here when given deep brain stimulation has been most successful in curing people with irreparable depression, really interesting. We have another area that’s sort of in here called the nucleus incumbents which is to do with that dopamine processing which also response when there is another place called the abengila(ph) which is um… a little bit less we’re researched. But deep brain stimulation where you send down an electrode very carefully, you know if the arms going like that that they shift, they oops, but this, this is, there are other processes, there are other things, but what it tells me, is if we stimulate that part of the brain, we're going to relieve out depression. So for some reason, that person’s part of the brain has not stimulated and you just gonna say, it’s 130, that’s right, I thought you’re setting more interesting, but no, half an hour to go, about at 11:30, But what it tells us that, that part of the brain is not stimulated. So I wonder if we could say that a neurobio feedback of some way, of and they’re doing this of actually, mentally focusing on this area of, I am going to stimulate that area myself from an intrinsic point of view. The… we are in the, the, the, the the, the, little bread basket of a very, very, very luscious dinner, you know, yeah. 

00:56:20
(inaudible ). 

00:56:21
RICHARD HILL They are, this is the stuff, yeah so that the deep, the, the deep stimulating the nuclueas incumbent and this Brodmann’s 25. But not broadly, because it’s a dangerous damn thing to do. Um… sticking wise down through people’s brains is, is not good, it’s okay in the, in the red experiments because when we lose, when we just got ah… bad luck. Ah… so, so we’re very cautious about this, but I am more interested in utilizing other mechanisms that stimulate our own stimulation of these things, ah… and that’s coming but not for this talk today, yes. 

00:56:55
(inaudible ) research are relating to deep information and they (inaudible ). 

00:57:01
RICHARD HILL Ah…, oh gosh! Aren’t you gorgeous, we won’t discuss that now, sleep is one of the central elements of human health. I just delivered ah… a speech on a sleeps and dreams, sleeping and dreaming ah… to were the Anzac group in, in Australia and I was discussing, the main thing I discussed was that sleep is a, I preface that by saying the body never does on thing for one thing to do one thing. It’s very clever system, it uses one thing all over the place for all kinds of different things so like for example we’ve all had a serotonin, that’s the lovely calmative, um… calming thing, it’s not just a stimulant. What serotonin does? Is it stimulates GABAergic neurons to calm us down. Serotonin is also used for muscle stimulation, serotonin is also used for stimulation of pain management in the spine. Body is very clever and use it all over the place, so you up I think somewhere to do one thing for one thing, for one thing. You're up at every where and then we get the side effects. And people say oh! I had no idea and suddenly they writing a paper saying, I gave this person this for this and look that happened, nearly killed him, but look here is a paper, please give me ah… an emeritus job. So it’s very difficult, we do things to people and things happen and um… and, and, and I'm, I'm, desperately trying to come to grips with this academic thing um… because I was an actor, you know, we just, we just learned Shakespeare and did it different ways. But it’s no different, it’s not different than this with the script. So sleep is really important um… There is a wonderful book called insomnia, um… which really great, which goes on and tell us that what we used to do is we used to sleep, I got to bed for 14 hours. We sleep for four or five hours, we would very often wake with a very vivid dream, we then be highly stimulated with chemicals that calmed us down. We would have a two hour period of tranquil contemplation; we would then sleep for another four or five hours, wake up and away we go. And in that two hours in the middle of the night, we would, there would be conversations, there would be sexual activity, there will be all kinds of really wonderful gentle peaceful tranquil activity, because our prolactin was raised up and what have we done, we have compressed all that and what do we do during the day, for a mindful contemplation, oh that’s right never. And this is what another reason so not only is lack of sleep, because of all the other things just simply it appeared the fact that sleep, we lose that the way we sleep, loses those periods of, of, of quiet contemplations stimulated by our dreams. So sleep, whatever you were thinking plus five things which is fantastic go for it, really good, I'm glad that boarded that, terribly, terribly, terribly important. First question you ask your client how’s your sleeping? Second question, what you eat? Third question how much do you exercise? Fourth question how much money have you got? Oh no! I am sorry. You don’t, you don’t, you don't, you don’t ask that at all. I'm hopeless, I get at there and you know they said and they say my problem is I have no money, you know. 

01:00:05
Theories •Attachment •Stereotype threat •Broaden and build •Jaak Panksepo- play •Self Determination •Self Efficacy •Positive Psychology 

01:00:05
RICHARD HILL And like a…. um… and just so we, we, we need to be aware that all these theories that we've got which are fantastic Um… are just elements and ways to try and look at this things, attachment theories, yeah great all about that useful stuff, go and have a look at that, Mary Hartzell, Dan Siegel do lovely stuff, Acheson does wonderful stuff. Stereotype threat, you might not have heard that, look that up, Aronson and Steele. How does the external attitudes of the world they took African-American group at Stanford university are very clever, gave African-Americans and Caucasian and Chicanos gave them a test, said it’s a social evaluation test. They all did the test. They all did exactly what they are supposed to do. Got another group, said this is an IQ test and we're using it to grade your papers. And the African-Americans went down six points because the world says to them day in day out you are dumb, you are from the trees, you are stupid, you are lesser, you are whatever. They have now done this interesting and others Steele, I,I think is the daughter has done it with the ah… with the Mexicans and done it with women, same stuff. Women are more likely to carry on to continue doing something that doesn't work under threat than men. Men, what… they weren’t doing something that worked in the first place. What is it if, if a man has an idea like you know that in the forest you know there… there… there is no one there to see it just the tree making noise but man has an idea in a forest that no one is there, is it still wrong? The Um…. Jaak Panksepp, we more play this afternoon gosh, you know wonderful stuff, cheer yourself up, do something without rules and what you'll find it will self-organize into a healthy process because we like to be healthy. We like to be in good shape. We don’t like being crook. What’s all that mental illness, all our mental and emotional illness is behavioral processes on the surface saying I don’t like what’s going on back here, will somebody help me. And what do we say a lot in our culture, just hide that, don’t talk about that um… because we don’t want to have a mental idiot in a family, may be move over there, go to Australia. Ah… yeah self determination, Deci & Ryan Deci, Ryan, self determination, self efficacy ah… is the, the new stuff by a lot(ph)… when you forget someone really, really, really, really famous. Self efficacy by… to the bye bye doll, no one is helping me, starts with b, quiz, look it up later is so embarrassing, this is what I am glad this is on film, thank you all the Americans, I’ve forgotten his name. Anyway, and positive psychology, ah… yeah, so, so that um… ah… with all the, the people working there and this broaden and built, I am talking about that, ah… ah… which is also really important stuff, to Martin Seligman down here. Ah… these are old things, understand them and know them, simply because in understanding them and know them you have an insight into the person. Is it your bag? No, then go on to something else. It is your bag than utilize it. So all these theories are not to position you, they utilizing things as Erickson, Erickson who I guess I am sort of went down because my mentor is Ernest Rossi, who is Erickson’s mind protégé, principal protégé and now Ernie, God love him, I just wouldn’t let him not mentor me and so Erickson was accused once of making up therapies for his clients. He just make up therapies, he said now what I do, is I look at what they’re already doing and I just do it more. As the famous wonderful sue ah… ah… ah…. sort of wisdom is if you are on a galloping horse it is wise to allow it continue in the same direction. 

01:04:25
Psychosocial Genomics The deep psychobiological process of "activity or experience-dependent gene expression and brain plasticity" associated with creativity and psychotherapy 

01:04:30
RICHARD HILL But begin some guidance, and that’s my dear friend Ernie. The deep psychobiological process of looking at activity or experience dependent gene expression and brain plasticity associated with that’s what we are doing, ah… that's better what you get from that at ah… ernestrossi.com, you can go and have a look, certainly my website richardhill.com.au has all these stuff as well and sites for that, that’s just showing you the next thing so if they invite me back, um… we can talk about genes and just freak you out some more, for I mean in the sense it freaks me out, ah… because if I thought that the brain was complex you know this little gene thing, you know certainly got four elements, this has got 302 billion of them which is really annoying, yes? 

01:05:15
We believe reside and what going to be so (inaudible )change? 

01:05:20
RICHARD HILL Yes believes reside all over the place and that’s one of the reasons why so our belief is not just a verbal idea, ah… it’s a physical ah… expression so it, it is, it is physically um… embedded as well. Certainly we, we speak of our beliefs but we act our believes, we walk it, we think it, we smell it, we, we, we say it, it has that belief has become the way and which we filter, all of our psychosocial engagement and so our entire system has become built and strengthened and long-term potentiated around the lens of that belief. So shifting that belief is a very, very, very difficult thing so that’s principally why ah… ah… the, the reason why that can be ah… ah… so, the other reason is because the system we're in is safe the one we're moving to is unknown so so therefore unsafe and safety is the big reason ah… that was a big thing that human being seek ah… and it’s just very difficult to encourage people to seek the new and the different and what else is coming but that’s interesting in life, very difficult to do it. Ah… but my beliefs are and you go um… so, still, but very interesting but it's… but our belief is far more than an idea. If I can shift your belief very rapidly then I got we haven't had that long and you haven’t lensed(ph) it you know into your experience they belong. So you can, you can gather where the people actually have it very deep as to whether it’s just well I read that in you know a magazine last week so that’s interesting. So the depths to which are belief is imbued within the whole construction is a, ah… is very important so sometimes therapy takes a day sometimes one therapy oh my god ah… thank you, sometimes it takes years. Because that belief that you are rotten and no good and also because it’s buried very often though the negative beliefs are buried in amygdala which is very-very difficult to alter. Ah… now lets have if I can in just five minutes so we can have some questions, I went through this, was just in my theory. Alright, um… I have looked upon these ideas and I’m wandering through all these things which gives a sense of where we are, as to okay… so if we have a situation where people are getting more stressed, more depressed, more anxious in a world that is becoming more affluent and more opportune and more possible. This doesn't make sense. So what is the flow of energy and information that is going wrong. So lets quickly look at the way the body utilizes exactly the same process, remember the body is clever. It utilizes things in many different ways. For two different things this is your standard stress response. Stress as in something bad something that is a problem, something that is an attack on my safety. So we… here we are, lovely creative, interactive, socially engaged, green person with funny hands and feet, wondering along something comes along, difficultly, saber-toothed tiger, mortgages go up, you know exam, yada, yada, yada We shut down of normal, we shut down our open engaged experience with the world and this is something I want to have time to get on at the moment, the polyvagal theory "polyvagal theory" by Stephen Porges, look up his stuff, look up ah… you’ll find on my website there will be a New Zealand an NZ say ah… link, go to the, the page and have a look I have got a lots of papers there. We shut down the normal and we get ready to fight or fight things. So we up our aggression, we up our focus, we close down our focus, this is what a Barbara Fredrickson’s broaden and build is all about. You know how can you do that? This is what, this is what rule game playing does to you and this is what play does to you. Ah… so we shut down our reasoning, we shut down our digestion, very-very not necessary to digest the stake you had last night while you’re fighting the saber-toothed tiger you just shut that down and access everything else. Ah… We shut down our libido ah… not very to good to have sex while fighting the saber-toothed tiger apparently is a destruction. The um… ah… resolution comes along, some you poke him in the eye, you do whatever it is. It runs away, the problem is solved, the people love you again and look you go through the de-stress you get creative, you laugh, yeah everybody loves me whether it’s a saber-toothed tiger or ah… a relationship that was working out well. Hugs, hugs, talking, talking, healing, healing, ah… calming down, contemplating into a little period here this stage four we call verification, where you just sent to that in your experience and then we go back into our game. That's this wonderful stake we've got. We use exactly the same system when we are in positive what I called challenging endeavor. This is where instead of being stressed we're having something that takes us into a point of, of out of safety. It's just something that is new, that is different, that is ah… interesting. Oh, that is interesting, well saber-toothed tiger. Ah… no saber-toothed tiger always respond to but Oh! Interest rates have gone up. Hmm… what I will do. You know, I've gosh I didn’t born to marry what do I do? I am an aboriginal what do I do? I am white guy who feels guilty what do I do? All these things can be stresses to which you response with all that shutting down and closing down or it becomes a challenge where you go wow… what can I create with this and the system is designed… you get the new information, you incubated it and this actually can be quite testing and this is exactly what I heard this morning. Wonderful state of incubation where everyone is going almost dark night of the soul you know yeah but we're getting some… and um… we've already had some, some bits and pieces but you get little break outs and you may get a room major break out and very often this break out comes through a crises, you know, we need to be whacked over the back of the head with the brick before we get it. And then we have the same illumination not only do we… do we go ah… I am alright but we go oh my God I realized stuff I get things, I do stuff as we'll see later on. You know you do a bit of play and suddenly you're sitting there and you've got the ball into the wherever and you go that's how you do the science of the things in black holes I know what it is. Um… as Einstein did when he came down in the elevator and the elevator stopped rather suddenly and he went… he said oh… that's interesting, everybody else goes oh god that's annoying and he went off and found the theory of gravity, which just shows how dull we are. But this is great this is what we do, but we live in a world that's really interesting, we go along whether it's a stressful or whether it's a challenging endeavor, we do the resolution whatever it is and just when we're about to get this bit which returns us to a state of healthy equilibrium, someone comes along and says yeah but she didn't do that very well and you got big fat butt and, and, and you're not very attractive and look you’re not even in the right part of tan skins are wrong color (inaudible ) parking ticket and I think beeps you other things, and mortgage rates are going high, by the time you've got out of the motivating… seminar and you've got to your car, you're more depressed than you were in the first place. Quite often, quite often and this leads to a continuing of the shut down of well being and you become defensive, disengaged, compelled, and stressed on a low level. And you do this for long time and it become chronic people come into your rooms and you say what's, what's happened? what's you know what's happened? And lot of people felt nothing. I am just depressed and this is my suggestion is to why. You're depressed because of chronic stress, which is to do with the sleep you get, the food you eat, the exercise you get, the social ah… psychosocial stresses and the nature of the way you've ah… experiencedly… build your brain, your believes, the believes of others around you, your stereotyped threats by… is it amazing we can make it at the bathroom in the morning, we'd add just sort of melting, but we can because we have if we can get down into this stage, into this area back to what I, and I just give him a name because remember I, I was doing use a complicated name I thought I’d use really easy names so the people understood without saying it again. This is a winner or loser world and winner/loser not as… I don’t know what winning/losing is… in, in the creative world, it’s just like something's are good and something's are not so good. But in a winner/looser world winning and losing when winning and losing when being better, when being right, when being ah… the, the goodie, actually determines whether you are a worthwhile human being or not, then that is a chronic stress because if you have to be a winner in order to be worthwhile as soon as you're a winner, you are under threat of being a loser and so if you're a winner you’re stressed because someone might come along and make you lose and if you're a loser then how can I ever win and so what we get, what and, what and, what would you predict would come out of a culture that has this chronic thing of be a winner to be successful would you expect people to try and make the, the, the, the dominance in ah… areas I’d expect bulling, I’d expect cheating, I’d expect the entire economic system we've got, I’d expect businesses trying to destroy, I’d expect councilors to be sitting there saying you're not better yet, which we sometime do, fortunately we do that mostly with our supervisor, they’re not better yet. Although I did have when I was training ah… the chap opposite me I was, I was the, the patient.. patient and he stopped and looked at the teacher and said he is not giving the right answers… and I thought, I do hope they file(ph) you please god. Um… but what happens is this is what I think we are dealing with more often than not. On top of the trauma, the personal disaster, the actual difficulties, the relationships struggles and so on and so forth. And actually it's being in this winner/loser world mindset that the flow of energy information’s I must fix this relationships for me to be a good person. I must have a better job because is everyone should behave this way and usually it surrounded with us should, must, have, can which we know from a lot of other theories. The creative world is oh I’ll get in five minutes which is good ah… the creative world state of mind is accessible and we do that, don't we do that? We're feeling really oh… and than something happens and we do some experience something like this afternoon's thing we all play, oh it’s better, really better I feel much better this is really good and than suddenly you go later I feel awful again. What, what happened? So trouble is this has become so constant and so underline in our culture, we don't notice it and we go down to it but then the stuff of the world comes along because that world create just, there is one of my books called the real world drive us crazy. But how do you fix it truly easy. This what causes it.

7 DEMONS •Right & Wrong •Good & Bad •Expectation •Fault & Blame •Criticism •Isolation & Separation •Guilt 

01:17:00
RICHARD HILL Having to be right or wrong and being right or wrong because of course if you're right, then the other guy is wrong, the other guy is responsible and the person responsible has to pay that's our culture. So I want to win because if I am losing I am responsible then I have to pay something. Responsible is the word response able. That’s all it is the ability to respond, not to be at fault and at guilt. I mean if everybody is guilty in this world, where is the innocence, where is the capacity to create you, you cannot create from a guilty perspective. Um… good and bad same thing ah… we go for that… we go for that… we go for being right, we go for the high moral ground. Expectation will of course that's you know (inaudible ) disaster. Fault and blame ah… cheerful I mean I love it, ah… we, we got to work I… she want us just do anything, I forget to say and you will say something like oh look at that vase. No I, I don't think, that’s not mine, and I don't know who put that there. Oh um… good. Um… I'm… but I, I, I could… it is a nice vase Oh it's not mine, first thing yeah… you know you can't say hello… hello yeah ah… but because her brain is in a mindset of defensive, caution of what's going on. Criticism of course, of course, there was those such thing is constructive criticism, it's a, it's a terminology we used to make ourselves feel nice. There is interactive play to create a beneficial change. We don't criticize you don’t say this thing you’re nuts and ah… I think if you just do what I say you'll be much better. That's not, you know but someone might say do you think I'm nuts you know so we… I think having, I think you've got trauma, I think you've got these, these issues. Ah… but we don't say it is a criticism, we don't say is a fault or blame or right or wrong and in fact I always say to people you are one-hundred percent able, just a little ah… unintegrated. Oh back, come back. Isolation and separation that's the way we do it, do you want to make a lot of money? How would you make a lot of money, you would isolate people. Because if I just chat with you and you are happy and jolly and have a good time then why would you want my product. So I'm gonna isolate you. I am going to make you feel independent, individual, disconnected and requiring one of these. It's so simple, it's so simple, it's sickening um… and guilt, and guilt is the other one um… we should have, all those people who didn't come to this lecture should have and I'm going to make everyone of them feel like (inaudible ) no not. I just in case, you thought I suddenly got a new mind set. It's tempting isn't it? That's the trouble it's so simple to shift someone into winner/loser mentality because it's all around us, just like those African-Americans were there in still were so simple to make them believe they would (inaudible ) and they never… they don't believe it they all always stand fit these people, but the culture had infused this into them. So what goes on around so how look it so awfully, ridiculously, obviously simple. How do we get out of the winner/loser world and the creative world, we hug, we physically connect because that generates the vagal system, look at the polyvagal theory. Gentle talk, we know that stimulates we're talking about things like serotonin and dopamine, and oxytocin Listening, just listening to somebody. It's fantastic, we learnt in acting just look at the brow over their nose and you can look at the moon(ph) in the face whole time. It's really a good system. Laughter of course because it generates all the sort of stuff and viscerally activates our cells, not just up here, up to here and here down, co-operation, achievable tasks as we talk about in self-determination and self-efficacy and love and kindness and of course what is our culture say about those, ah… (inaudible ) bloody things. That's just what women do. Ah… I was so astounded ah… five years, six years married and Suisse's boy Peter who is gorgeous and we fixed him up a lot. We've… we've integrated him a lot, we've integrated him a lot. But she was saying about cleaning up and he was getting frustrated and he's got ADD issues and something's and he said Suisse why aren’t you doing that he said yeah but it’s women's work and of course he looked at me instantly for support and after I had strangled him Suisse got on to him and, and, and kick the, kick the love back into him.

The Purpose Of Life To creatively participate in the experience 

01:22:00
RICHARD HILL So the purpose of life are not really, to creatively so with open unambiguous, un ah… ah… affected freedom to creatively in the desire to make more participate in the experience. To see how it can allows us to find connections that have been lost, open connections that haven't existed and strengthen connections that already exist and we create the integrated person who from the top of the head and the bottom of the feet all the way in to their genes. Changes the nature of the way their body expresses itself so that eventually it emerges through the biology into a behavior that makes for a world where we actually have human beings at it centre. Ladies and Gentleman that is why we studied the brain. Thank you.
