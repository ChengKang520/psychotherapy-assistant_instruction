Helms Award Lecture What Is It About A Mountain Top? An Activist Legacy of Mentoring and Scholarship Thomas Parham, Ph.D. University of California, Irvine 

00:00:35
MARIE L. MIVILLE , Ph.D. And so now I would like to introduce Dr. Thomas Parham, this years recipient of the Helms Mentoring Award Address. So I mentioned last year Janet was one of my mentors in graduate school and she was my Doctoral Dissertation Advisor when I was in the counseling program at the University of Maryland. Indeed, I was actually a graduate student here back in ’91 when Robert Carter, the Dr. Carter(ph) started the award, and so I was a graduate student like many of you, here in the audience, this very room when I saw my own mentor, come up and receive the first award, an award named for her. And so, now as I reflect what mentoring meant to me, then as a student and what it means for me now as a professional. I just think of some very important qualities that our award winner, Dr. Thomas Parham (inaudible ). I have known Thomas for many-many years. He has been one of our great leaders, friends, allies, leaders, brothers and over time my respect and love for you has just only grown Thomas. Couple of years ago when Dr. Constantine(ph) asked me to take on this Round Table Director role, Thomas called me out of the blue and he just said “Marie, I know you are… you’ve taken on this round table. I just want you to know any thing you want me to do, I’ll do it. I am there.” So, like my own flesh and blood, brothers know don’t you know, be careful what you offer. And I have to say Thomas, I… I really had Thomas very present last year and he was here at the beginning, in the middle and of course at the end and… and he just was so gracious and kind, the whole way through. Dr. Parham is the 20th recipient of the Helms Award and he stands in great company with such folks and if you are here please stand. Joe White(ph), Melba Vasquez(ph), Joseph Trimble(ph), Beve Greene(ph), Joseph Poterotto(ph), Stanley Sue(ph), H.A. Franklyn(ph), Rosie Bingham(ph) and many-many others. Joe back to (inaudible ).

MARIE L. MIVILLE Indeed, Thomas was here at the very first round table back in ’83 in a blizzard(ph) I’m told. So, he not just only talks to talk but he is here, helping us walk our walks. So, this a very special year for us to celebrate two decades of mentors who’ve been warriors, brilliant thinkers, motivating leaders for racial cultural issues and psychology in education. And just look at how strong our community remains today as we just go through this tradition one more time this weekend, yes. Thomas, my brother you are so deserving to be in this circle, to receive this award and I look forward to many more years of being part of this circle. Now, take us home.

DR. THOMAS PARHAM Thank you, Thank you. Good afternoon. Let me try that again, and there has been a couple of days at a round table but right with all the energy that these coordinators have put into this magnificent conference and with all the positive feedback, I’ve heard from (inaudible ), you know the one of the presentations you’ve been through. I know we can come home little stronger than that, Good afternoon. 

00:04:30
Good afternoon. 

00:04:30
DR. THOMAS PARHAM It is a… a pleasure and I want to begin my remarks today by providing out things with special acknowledgments and thank you’s to some people. First of all I wanna thank Dr. Marie Miville, the current Director of the Winter Roundtable and the many students and faculty colleagues who plan and manage this conference each February for the last 27 years. That’s… That’s pretty (inaudible ) amazing. Another 10 seconds on this one. The current generation of students come and participate in conferences like this because as long as you have been a graduate student, it has always existed. The early career professionals come and participate because it has always existed. But what we want you to know is that, for lots of us in this room it did not always exist. And so I want you to know how significant it is for us to be here 27 years and as we remind ourselves about the long and glorious history of this round table, I want to acknowledge the legacy of leadership that has created and really sustained what is not just a regional conference but a national one and that has helped us really to address the condition of cultural sterility that has existed in the disciplines of psychology and counseling for, far too long and we’ve always, try to acknowledge him but we do some kind of a curfree(ph) way and I can’t let that go today. Because the origin of the round table was really the vision of this brother and… and I want him to stand so that we can acknowledge. This is Dr. Sam Johnson who a great deal of pride for and I can’t accept this award without given him some due(ph). 

00:06:40

00:06:50
DR. THOMAS PARHAM And following Sam was… was… was Dr. Robert Carter and Dr. Carter was Madonna Constantine and now Marie Miville and so I wanna thank all of you as well, the attendees of the conference for allowing me to share some words in reflections in honor of this prestigious award named after a woman who most of you know holds a very special place in my heart and that is Dr. Janet Helms. And next allow me to call on the creator, (inaudible ) announces us to bare with this to my remarks and hopes that what they hear through my words and utterances will reflect their way and they will be pleased. We are here in this round table this year and this Helms Award, to hopefully engage our intellects and ignite our passion. I hope that’s what lots of you came for. And so we come to… to this place in a city that is known for it’s never ending night life ambiance, yes? New York like the city that never sleeps. Some yell what we hear is more than like you hadn’t been to sleep yet right! And as also known, you know not just for the night life ambiance but for it’s cultural landmarks and in an institution, at Columbia University that is now some 256 years old. That was first founded as King’s College way back in 1754. How many of you knew that? Lots of you didn’t know that, right? But we are here in these places, in this city, in this university in a time of considerable and certainty about our economic political and educational and social futures. But we come to try to pause and to reflect and to speak out and hopefully we’ve had a chance to do that this weekend. But we gathered this time not merely as people of different races and genders and physical abilities and sexual orientations and age ranges but as psychology and counseling professionals and colleagues and graduate students and others, and all of us committed to addressing the mental(ph) health needs of communities all across this nation. And in this year when we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Helms Award, she but want us to highlight the fact I think that this Winter Roundtable Conference is a multicultural rainbow that is consistent with Dr. King’s dream, that we should all live and study together. And how blessed we are that for at least one weekend every year amid the obligations and challenges of our personal and professional lives we… we come to this place committing ourselves to enlighten our minds and challenge our biases and navigate the intellectual, emotional and spiritual space. That is truly multicultural. How many of you have had some of your biases, challenge since you have been here? Some of you assumptions question? Your intellects ignited? That’s what the round table was really designed to do. Because what’s true in my work is that I know that we have more in common than we know. We are united by our common bounds of commitment. We are connected by desire to give thanks for all the ways in which we’ve been blessed and we are really dignified in the knowledge that our professions of counseling in psychology are doing good work in communities all across this country. Now, at the moment when we are blessed with extreme abundance, I can’t lose sight of the fact that it’s easy for a world to lose sight of those folk who are less fortunate and I hear lots of us who talk about the challenges that we face in our academic department or the challenges we face because I didn’t get this done or in my department somebody didn’t like me, I got a critique from a professor and it… it really is interesting about how we can textualize struggle because it’s easy to lose sight in this privileged academic environment of those who are less fortunate. I mean, (inaudible ) when the war as I reckon Afghanistan have a nation focused on a comfortable exist strategy and we try to disguise as it is liberation and victory, yeah? It’s easy to divert our attention away from what I think are other domestic problems that intrigue nightmare realities for a number of people in our nation. In a moment when we get a earthquake disaster of unparallel proportion that has all of us praying for the victims (inaudible ) sending aids to the needy and reflected on the possibilities locally. It’s easy to ignore the plight of so many in our nation who live in disaster like conditions every day without the benefit of international news coverage to plea their case for relief and assistance. But we who occupy these adult (inaudible ) of the world, particularly the (inaudible ) of psychology and counseling. What we are supposed to be providing empathy and compassion for those who are needy. We can not be healers, we were all called to be and lose sight of those who are less fortunate than we are. That is really the mission in one of the reasons we come to the Round Table (inaudible ). Now, in acknowledging the significance of this award, I can’t do so without thanking a couple of people, so bare with me a couple of minutes before I kinda get into my remarks as I this kind of collect (inaudible ). Because there are lots of people who have helped, guide my life and have ordered my steps and the first of course I thank God for blessing me in all the ways that he or she has. The second of course I wanna thank my late mother Sete Parham(ph), whose capacity for sharing and heart for giving is unrivaled in my world and I thank her for her model of self sacrifice and how blessed I am as I think about her and call her name that the creator chose her to guide my work and to feed my soul and to nourish my spirit. Nobody could have wished for a greater mama on this planet for as long as she was here and also wanna thank my family. Both my wife Davida, my daughters Kenya and Tonya and my siblings who provided me with constant support and as a Dady is… is happy who receives a call from his youngest child, just a little while ago before you were assembling in the room to say, “Proud of you Dad, Good Luck!” and I receive a call not 10 seconds later from my child who lives here to say, “See you in a minute there.” You know, that’s when you know you (inaudible ) arrive, so I want you to say hello to my oldest daughter Tonya (inaudible ) in the back who just walked in. 

00:13:55

00:14:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Many folks are lucky in their life to have one person they call Mentor or (inaudible ) as we call it in African tradition. I’ve been fortunate and blessed enough to have three such individuals and I have to thank them here today. I wanna first of all thank Dr. Joseph White, who is Professor Emeritus of psychology, psychiatry and comparative culture at the University of California, Irvine. Joe White was my first mentor. And Joe saw in me what he described as a genius and promise I couldn’t see in myself. And Dr. White gave me a larger vision of hope and a roadmap for my future that taught me to not only recognize the gifts that I was blessed with but also he gave me an obligation about the responsibility to use those gifts in ways that would impact the profession as a whole. He was very clear with me, “Parham right your work goes way beyond what your role and function will be or what ever title you acquire(ph).” And my goal was to try to impact large groups of not just African American folk but other communities of color and white folk and every body who is considered a brother sister of the human family and I have to thank Joe White for that. Secondly I wanna thank Dr. Horace Mitchell, Counseling Psychologist in his own right who is the current President at California State University at Bakersfield and former Professor at Washington University in St. Louis, later Vice Chancellor of University of California, Irvine and Brooklyn. Because Dr. Mitchell was the second mentor of mine who taught and mentored me during my 10 year at Washington University in the Counseling Sight Program and the Masters Program. And Horace taught me about professionalism and Horace taught me about conscious manhood and Horace reinforced the value of friendship and I learnt a great deal from Dr. Mitchell in the context of my administrative career as well, as he then recruited me to come back from University of Pennsylvania to, U.C. Irvine. And included in that lesson I think was not only that it was okay to be a versatile professional, so that not only was I the administrator but I could still teach and still research and still mentor folk and still do clinical work and do what all because he had a vision for me that said, “No you are talented enough to be but if you do that, it’s just the function of do you have the will to want to step out and get it done? There is no limitation on which you can do in this University, in this community needs it all and I thank him for that. In one of those final lessons that he taught me that I think he is the best, he is the best at least I’ve ever seen. is he taught me how to affect a cultural presence in an institution of higher learning without antagonizing the powers that be. And I tell him, “I’m not anyway as good as he is.” Alright. He says, “No, No, No yes you are.” But he is the master in that. Because trying to affect a black presence or a Latino presence or an Asian presence or (inaudible ) presence in an institution. You will always run up against instances of resistance. And he found a way to get it done and still keep people smiling. He is a master at that. What a blessing to have him for a second mentor. And my third mentor, I have to thank is, of course Dr. Janet Helms herself and I love Janet dearly and I’m so grateful to her. Because during my doctoral studies she was a Professor of Psychology at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, who then moved to University of Maryland and now of course you know she is an (inaudible ) at Boston College. But Dr. Helms refined my skill. And she refined my theory in my conceptualization in my research and she sharpen my intellect and like a Queen mother, she held me close until she thought I was ready to sprout wings and fly. Her impact upon my development has been profound and she and I continue to enjoy relationship very fulfilling one in fact to this day as professional colleagues and friends. How lucky I have been! How blessed I’ve been! As you award me today to have had these individuals in my life. As I accept this award today in their honor in hopes that the working contributions to the field will be a fitting tribute that justifies their faith and their investment in me because I’m very clear that I do owe a debt to all of them. And beyond these mentors I’ve to also thank several other people who have impact in my work. I have colleagues in the Association of Black Psychologists. The Dayce Helios(ph), the Bob Williams(ph), the Wayde Novels(ph), the Naeem Akbar(ph), the A.J.(ph) and Nancy Boyd Franklin(ph). The Lynda James Myers(ph) and particularly Bill Cross, and Bill sent me a note before coming that he was unable to fly with a medical condition but I want to put a special shine(ph) out to Bill in addition to my colleagues in ABPsy. Because he modeled for me how… how an intellectual giant that I consider him to be and a genius connects with graduate students trying to just feel the way around, framing the discourse and trying to develop a scale and do there kind of dissertation and thesis studies. And I recall that our affiliation and friendship began in 1978 when I was a doctoral student in Carbondale. And I began to do my work on racial identity in counselor preference and I called him up to talk to him about the (inaudible ) models and developing a scale to measure the (inaudible ) and I member picking up a phone like most of you do to other colleagues around the country and call him up like a low little graduate students say “Dr. Cross” you know. And he just put me at ease so quickly. He said, “Yeah man, calm down. How can I help…” You know, what ever alright. So he just kind of diffused it literally and just kind of broke it down and said how can I help and we talked and he is been such a blessing in my life and the relationship that we have built over time is very-very special to me and I thank him for his advise and mentoring and I thank him for and blessing me and others with his gifted intellect and I thank him for his friendship and his support and his encouragement and his love that he and all of my colleagues in the Association of Black Psychologists have given me for years and I’ve been one of those special folk who have traversed the landscape of both ABPSy and APA. And I am grateful to my colleagues in both Division 17 and 45. But I am especially grateful to my folk in the minority fellowship program and to Dr. James Jones. How blessed I’ve been to be a minority fellow! And I thank Dr. Jones for that opportunity to be a part of that family and I represent them in a lot of the work that I do. And I also want to mention special (inaudible ) to my National Institute for Multicultural Counseling family, to my dear brother and friend Dr. Derald Sue. You guys are here and not just Dr. Sue's class or that’s just Dr. Sue’s lab, you have no clue. How… How good that brother is? And I know how special he is as a friend and a brother to me. I love him to death. But also I have lots of colleagues like that around the country, who I have worked with and we have worked both above ground as well as behind the scenes. With Allen and Mary Ivey and Michael D’Andrea and Judy Daniels and Don Locke and Patricia Arredondo and Beverly O’Bryan. I mean our affiliation together has produced I think many positive and productive moments and times while also contributing I think to outcomes that literally have helped to transform the profession and we went into that not with the whole bunch of egos but in understanding that we have so much respect for each others work. But we understood a fundamental lesson that lots of folk around the country still haven’t learnt. We have institutions around the country that have all star talent, right. In their counseling centers and academic departments and other places but they have no synergy that allows them to work together because of the backbiting and finger pointing and other stuff that kinda goes in. That is never part of the National Institute for Multicultural Competence, in all the people that we have extended it to, alright. To the Lisa’s and to the Rebacca’s and to the other folk who are now the next generation of folk coming in, right. We always believe that you can always afford to get something done as long as you didn’t care who got the credit for and the lots of things that have been influenced in both APA and ACA that have happened with us behind the scenes that we have pushed to margin and tried to make it difference for the people there and I want to give them a special colleague(ph). Now the beauty of the legacy that my mentors infused into me is not something(ph) reflected in the wonderful words of wisdom and say it advise that each has provided and guided my career but rather the beauty of my relationship with Dr. White and Horace Mitchell and Janet Helms and the others that I’ve mentioned, is that they left me a blue print for not only cultivating new generations of towns as scholars and (inaudible ) but also for institution building. How do we do that in the context of mentor? And so she come as no surprise that amid the lessons in life and professional guidance was also mixed a keen awareness that the struggle is just part of pain you will do. That within the context of reciprocal exchange, I had a responsibility to extend to others the same support, guidance and mentorship that I had received from each of them and not my passion. Not only my passion, for but my bias. I really have a strong bias toward reciprocal exchange in mentoring, is reinforced by my jagnors(ph), my mentors. But was in reality born out of a recognition of struggle, that people of African descent have waged for years. That is what was important to me in that particular struggle. And because they have waged for all those years, to try to develop a standard of dignity and human decency within the context of a socially oppressive society. It is that struggle that really has ignited the passion in me that I try then to ignite and reciprocate in my students. And so to help us understand that life space in which my consciousness has been stimulated. I want to invite us all to make a reference to a song that has… for me been stimulating. Wanna just contextualize that this is a song that was composed by an R & B artist, also was a jazz artist, also a self described blue zoologist(ph) by the name of Gil Scott-Heron. Anybody heard of Gil, back in the day? Gil wrote this piece in 1977. I mean he just touched me that long. And he wrote it on the occasion of Fannie Lou Hamer’s death. You all know about Fannie Lou Hamer? In an honor of Fannie Lou Hamer he wrote this song and the song is entitled from 95 South. 95 south is a highway down the eastern (inaudible ) and the subtitle is from “All of the places we’ve been.” And so the passion that I have and that I try to bring to my work is not simply right, a reciprocal exchange from the mentors I get but my passion was really born out of a struggle that African descent for ever waged. And so this video helps us to really connect up to that.

00:26:25
GIL SCOTT-HERON In my lifetime I've been in towns where there was no freedom or future around. I've been in places where you could not eat or take a drink of water where ever you pleased. And now that I meet you in the middle of a mountain Well, I'm reaching all out from within. And all I can think of are chapters and scenes of all of the places we've been. I'm not such an old man so don't get me wrong. I'm the latest survivor of the constantly strong. I've been to Mississippi and down city streets, I've seen days of plenty and nights with nothing to eat. But I'm not too happy about the middle of a mountain so soon I'll be climbing again. 'Cause all I can think of are chapters and scenes of all of the places we've been. 

00:28:00

00:28:45
GIL SCOTT-HERON I was raised up in a small town in the country down south so I've been close enough to know what oppression's about. Placed on this mountain with a rare chance to see dreams once envisioned by folks much braver than me. And since their lives got me to the middle of a mountain Well, I can't stop and give up on them. 'Cause their lights that shine on inspire me to climb on from all of the places we've been. From all of the places we've been, from all of the places we’ve been a lot of places, yeah from all of the places we've been. Been down, been down, been down, a lot of roads and places. All of the places from all of the, all of the, all of the, all of the places… 

00:30:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Gil Scott-Heron made the hell out this song, didn’t he? 

00:30:15

00:30:20
DR. THOMAS PARHAM “95 South From all of the places we’ve been” and when I was preparing this Helm’s lecture this past several weeks, I had a question on my mind. Given this time of year in African history month and it closely follows on nations celebration of Martin Luther King symposiums and celebrations and then Gil Scott-Heron’s song about climbing a mountain. I suspected that cultural ambiance when mixed with the reflections about my life as a mentor and a scholar certainly influenced my topic today. And the question that it raised from me, what is it about a Mountain Top? And so I’ve come today to tell(ph) my remarks. What is it about a Mountain Top in activist legacy of mentoring and scholarship? Gil Scott-Heron’s song describes a journey of climbing from the middle of the mountain towards the top and I wonder, “What is it about a Mountain Top? That insights such… such devotion to continue struggling amidst social pressure to give up in abundance once commitment to justice. Dr. King’s dream involved the vision to the Mountain Top and I want to know, “What is it about a Mountain Top?” that inspires such clarity, essence of hope such a bold revelation? In the bible, which I read and study frequently, there is a chapter in the book of Genesis that recalls an incident where the God is testing Abraham’s love. He is testing his faith and devotion and even his loyalty and he sends him up to a Mountain Top to sacrifice his son Isaac. However, just before the sacrifice is supposed to take place, an angel appears and Abraham, right, says, “What up” and angel says, “Don’t harm your son.” But points to a ram over caught in the thicket of the bush with the horns and says “Use the ram in the nearby bush for the sacrifice.” So the angel arrives just in time, that by the way is where that expression God will provide comes from. But it’s Abraham’s obedience to God creates a reciprocal exchange where God rewards Abraham exponentially in exchange for his devotion, but what is it about a Mountain Top that inspires such devotion? Could it be, to be on the Mountain Top gets you little closer to the creator and our spiritual power? You are up so high, the air is so pure and the sky so clear that you believe that you can reach out and touch the face of God. Could it be that being on the Mountain Top insights visions of possibility where we're able to see above the clouds of (inaudible ) to visions of how to transform and improvise on life challenges? Maybe your relationships are quite right. Or may be your single parent’s status was something you didn’t count on or maybe your paycheck is insufficient or maybe your grades aren’t up to standard or your projects in graduate school not preceding with the same pays you expect to maintain. Maybe your confidence, maybe winning after your personal setback like having a manuscript rejected or receiving some critique from a colleague or student valuation or perhaps your friendship might be going through a rough time it is been tested or maybe your political party was denied victory in the last election or… or maybe you believe that somehow racism and sexism are such a burden in your life that you question why you should even try to succeed? Maybe your children are falling short of your expectation as a parent. Whatever it is. The clouds of life dilemmas have you unable to see your way through the visual obstruction to a brighter day? And so you need to climb. You got to start climbing that mountain, much like Gil Scott talked about. As you climb that mountain moving past the bushes of burden as you are climbing the mountain moving past the stones of stagnation as you climb that mountain stepping over the rocks of resignation, as you climb that mounts of (inaudible ) and slippery slopes of anger and hurt and resentment as you are climbing that mountain, trying to avoid those case or confusion. At some point, you come to a plateau where you can see endless possibility you couldn’t imagine while you were down in the valley on the ground. Could it be that being on the Mountain Top inspires phase(ph) such that we believe that whatever hardship we might face or trials or tribulations that test our mental, emotional and spiritual fortitude, we leave there with the renewed sense of confidence always believe in much like Abraham did, much like Martin Luther King did, much like Gil Scott-Heron did that everything is gonna be alright. What is it about a Mountain Top? That gives people that kind of hope when all objective data indicates that there should be none because the Mountain Top does get you closer to your God given potential. The Mountain Top inspires devotion. The Mountain Top insights clarity of vision. The Mountain Top crystallizes for you and each of us choices an options and the Mountain Top also instigates faith. What is it about a Mountain Top my friends, that does that? Colleagues and friends, students, what I want to ask you is where is your Mountain Top? Somebody heard me this afternoon, where is your Mountain Top that place in your life that gets you closer to the source of your inspiration? Where is your Mountain Top that place that gives you clarity when you can’t quite see through the haze? Where is your Mountain Top that… that place that inspires devotion and obedience to an elders word that is forced out of the ways more experience people come to know what they know in the world? Where is your Mountain Top? For me, that Mountain Top is a symbolic relationship and representation for the mentors and mentoring relationships that I’ve had in my life. That has been my Mountain Top. Then in our lives, these are the individuals whose positions and life experience have given them a perspective that should assist younger folks in setting goals and crystallizing dreams and aspirations and clarifying values and preparing for differential outcomes and generating the broadest range of choices and options and navigating those pathways to productivity and success. This is what I’ve tried to be in my personal and professional life and I don’t know about you. I don’t know about most of you in here, but I’m convinced that you can’t find the Mountain Top in the neighborhood among the desperate housewives. You can’t find the Mountain Top in the pharmaceutical extractions that clouds your mind. You can’t find the Mountain Top in the class (inaudible ) horses of Budweiser or a race cars of (inaudible ) drive or the 18th century taverns of Amstel light. You can’t even find them in a vocal style of Alicia Keys and (inaudible ) as good as they are. You save your money on your GEICO insurance, won't get you to the Mountain Top either. But, but you can find it right here in conferences like this. In the informal spaces where we reside. You can find it in academic institutions that embrace support and collaboration rather than competition and jealousy. You can find it in organizations like the Association of Black Psychologists or APA’s Minority Fellowship Program. You can find that in your own heart if you look deep enough. You can find it in the obligation to provide where suprosity of students in exchange for the support that you’ve been provided yourself. And never forgetting the ways in which you have been blessed. Where is your Mountain Top? You can find it deep down in your spirit, if you just listen enough to your spirit. If you still your mind are not to listen to your spirit. Everybody my friends has to have a Mountain Top in their lives. Indeed, you can find it in the relationships between you and those mentors those (inaudible ) as we call them in African tradition, in your life that touched your life. And through all the craziness, through all the stuff as you are looking for validation, as you are looking for award, as you are looking for recognition and you get no validation in classroom and you try to offer an opinion to somebody and you try to do some research to the journals ain’t trying to hear you, you try to gotta subject sample that they are not trying to do and figure how come you don’t have a compare grouped that has nothing to do with your sample but my first mentor pulled me aside, he said, “Brother, you can help me a very simple lesson.” Joe White said, “Brother you can not seek validation from your presence(ph), I had to go to the Mountain Top to find that. You can’t seek validation from your oppressor(ph) and then finally in that mountain in myself. I reasoned that I might be their rock that other students are to cling to in a storm that other professional colleagues might cling to on a storm or just stand on when they needed a broader vision of possibility. So when speaking on this issue and reflecting on my life and contributions in psychology and counseling, know that my scholarship in mentoring activities have been anchored in several assumptions. So let me take a moment just outline these. The first assumption I make in my mentoring a scholarship, is that I understand that in the human condition, it is summed up in this African phrase that I’ve stylized as overtime that says that life at it’s best is a creative synthesis of opposites in fruitful harmony. And in that fruitful harmony I have to always learn to contextualize both the good and the bad. But what it helped to really believe at a deep structural level is that each of us is a seed of divinely inspired possibility, which when nurtured in it’s proper context, it can and will grow into the fullest expression of all we are supposed to become. So in my role as a mentor, as an (inaudible ), I see it is my obligation to nurture the seeds of possibility that have found their way into, must be of influence. And so whether I till the soil of cultural richness or water the seeds in ground with the drops of personal and intellectual curiosity or synthesis the sunlight and shade of encouragement and critique that each of them will need or stamp out the weeds of discouragement and disappointment with words of wisdom that helped those our mentor trance in the moments of frustration with the dose of contextualizing struggle. My goal is always to create a developmental space where I can nurture the dreams and aspirations of those that I touch and help them see a broader vision of possibility and potential for themselves. That is what (inaudible ) do. You got to be able to find the Mountain Top. The second assumption I’ve made in my work over time, over these many years, recognizes that I have been blessed (inaudible ) tremendous legacy of struggle as you’ve seen, by my elders and ancestors and consequently the opportunity for me to highlight whatever (inaudible ) ability I might have was really made possible by some people who came long before me, struggled long and hard before I was even on the planet. And in their life time they made significant sacrifices so that I and others can occupy this particular space and time. And so I have always believed that I owe a debt of service and a commitment to the current of future generations of young men and women. So that I might honor the sacrifices that were made for me. This is a big part of what drives me. What is Parham or where your spirit comes from because I can't stop and give up on all these folks you just saw in that video. The third assumption I make and I’ve made in my mentoring a scholarship is that in reclaiming the African character, it requires a commitment for me to speak truth to power and to manage my fears with integrity and righteous character and that truth is sometimes manifested in the words I write, the phrases I speak, even the positions I evocate for on behalf of those who have something to say but are rarely heard. For those who desire to change, but have somehow stifled by the challenges and adversities in life. The fourth assumption I make that has guided my work as a mentor and scholar is that challenging systems of racism and white supremacy and privilege requires a voice and the voice I’ve tried to maintain has always had to be clear enough to be understood, but truthful enough to be believed. It had to be compelling enough to be persuasive but sensitive enough not to be offensive to people. It had to be humble enough to recognize fault and error and apologize for when it happened and it had to be strong enough to withstand social critique and condemnation that comes with once refusal to confine one’s boundaries within the circumference of the world’s activity. That has been my voice. The fifth assumption that I’ve made and then I continue to make within the context of reciprocal exchange, is that I can never be all I can be, in absence of a relationship with the people in my life. Let me say that again. I can never be all I can be in absence of a relationship with the people in my life. I can never be a scholar, I try to be in absence of a relationship with the students, colleagues and community others who read and embrace my work. I can never be the (inaudible ), the mentor I strive to be in absence of a relationship that I have developed to maintain with the students and people over the last two and a half almost three decades that I’ve been doing this. I thank them and all of you for trusting me with their ideas, with their passion, with their hopes, with their frustrations and their dreams, how blessed I’m that they have trusted me in that reciprocal relationship. And the last assumption that I’ve made that has guided my work is that, I believe you can not be a force for light and truth in the world without a fundamental belief in the transformative possibilities of the human spirit. Let me say that again. You can not be a force for light and truth in the world without a belief in the transformative possibilities of the human spirit. The human condition is endowed with the capacity to be and become and recognize in their potential requires that all of us not fix it on where people already given point in time or where they might have been at a low moment where mistake, error or trouble was a temporary companion of theirs, rather being a healer, being a healer. Our focus should have hold in on where they can be with the modicum of support, encouragement, affirmation, validation and especially love. That is what healers do. It’s easy to critique and find fault, yes? It is easy right, it takes nothing to focus on somebody’s low GRE scores or the weaknesses and use those to justify why there is somehow unworthy of admission into a graduate program or inappropriate for an internship or job opportunity or unsuited for tenure or career position. It is easy to find an academic personnel policy and use that as a justification to exclude a value colleague from a teaching or research or counseling position, that’s easy. But, but, I always believe that a true healer recognizes that everyone is blessed with a genius, and everyone is blessed with a gift, and the fact that they may remain that gift in them, remains more latent than visible. Some time has less to do with their capability and more to do with other peoples inability to see beyond the few faults and frailties or policies that kept us locked in that space of conceptual concentration(ph) that we can’t think outside the boxes, see the genius in them that we are kicking to the curb and pushing aside. I know I am talking to somebody this afternoon. These are the assumptions that I have made that have guided and continue to guide my work as a scholar and mentor and that has been the substance of my mountain. When I wanted a mountain that’s what I found. But I want you to be aware, there is a caution in this message. That the mountain you climb be very aware, is not the kind that crumbles on the hard times, because you can’t make a mountain out of material possession and expect it to last. Do you hear me? You can’t make a mountain out of material possession, and expect it to last. You can’t make a mountain out of an exaggerated sense of ego and self importance and expect it to inspire anything other than vanity and (inaudible ) tenancies. But my friends everybody needs a Mountain Top. Turn to your neighbor real quick I want you to say everybody needs a Mountain Top, alright? But have you noticed by the way, even if everybody needs a Mountain Top right, that those of though, those of other people that we’ve talked about today, right! Who go up to the mountain. Did you notice that they really stay there? How many of you noticed that? They have really stayed there. Abraham went to the Mountain Top with his son but he didn’t stayed there. Moses went up to the mountain but he didn’t stayed there, Martin Luther King went to the Mountain Top but he didn’t stayed there. Gil Scott Heron talked about climbing the mountain again from a plateau he was on, he didn’t stayed there. Each of them came down from the mountain prepared to sacrifice whatever they had in service to the fellow man and woman. And it raises a last question for us today. And it raises a question in me, this is, “What was I prepared to sacrifice and give to others in support of my love for and obedience and devotion to the mentors in my life? Most of my mentor weren’t asking me for my life, they were simply asking me some of my time, to be able to serve others. That was a reciprocal exchange and as a consequence, I’ve reasoned that one of the best ways to honor the commitment my mentors made to me is by serving others. Be the undergraduate or graduate students, early career professionals, season professionals, whatever and recipro… reci…, reciprocally orienting them with a belief that each of them had a similar obligation to help out all the people, right! in the next generation to follow them. And the hundreds of the folks at this point that I’ve taught and trained and… and mentored, they’ve all asked me, they say Dr. P “How can I thank you, I want to thank you.” And each time, each time they say that to me, I reply, that while I appreciate their thanks, the best way to thank me is to commit to do for others, what you believe I’ve done for you. This was the lesson first taught to me by Joe White and reinforced by Horace Mitchell and Janet Helms. And if you ask any of my students who I teach and train, right! That is what they will tell you I’ve teach them. So in my life as a scholar and mentor I’ve tried to offer hope to those who found their spirits in midst of despair. I’ve tried to offer courage to those whose lives were filled with fear. I try to offer clarity to those whose lives were contaminated by confusion. I offer compassion to those whose lives were played by mouse of insensitivity and I tried to offer love to those whose life experience had been singed(ph) by the fires of hate and evil. What is it about a mountain top that inspires such obedience and instigate such actions? I want you get to your mountain top my friends, you’ve got to think about coming down. But you’ve got to think about extending some kindness to someone in need, you’ve got to show some love in places where hate plots to take over. You’ve got to resonate with that inspiring spirit that Dr. King said. You remember Dr. King’s word, “We can’t just put his picture up on the wall and not call out his words” because he said, ”If I can help somebody as I pass along, if I can cheer somebody with a word or song, if I can show somebody they’re traveling wrong. Then my living will not be in vain. In a similar way, you my friends must become those advocates for social justice in the context of your mentoring. That is what I’ve tried to do and that is the individual that you honor today. You’ve got to learn to walk the valleys of despair, instilling hope in people who believe, they’ve been unjustly suffering. You’ve got to walk to streets of your neighborhoods and corridors of your academic institutions to make them better. You’ve got to be able to touch a student’s life with words of encouragement and make it better. You’ve got to be able to extend the hand of friendship across the demographic boundary and make your relationship better. You've got be able to confront evil then… and unkindness in the life space you occupy and make it better. And you’ve really got a challenge your own biases and assumptions you hold about other people and replace then with a recognition for an appreciation of the dignity and humanity of every men, women, and child. In life my friends, I've never been a fan of democratic sanity, doing things that just because everybody else was doing it. Because everybody was acting in particular way or free to speak out against what they knew was wrong. But I did try to stand on the mountain of principles consistent with those assumptions that I have outlined during this presentation. And as we honor the legacy of doctor’s, White and Mitchell and especially Dr. Helms with this award, we need to come down off of our mountain tops and find a way to engage life with an energy and enthusiasm that is infectious. We don’t have to wait for disaster to strike in order to be kind? Right! We don't have to wait for the World Trade Center to fall in order to recognize that we all in this thing together. We don't have to wait for famine to strike in order to consider feeding a hungry. We don't have to wait for the fire to destroy someone's home and all that worldly possessions in order for us to offer some support and help clothe a naked. Similarly we don't have to wait for student to be confused in order to offer advice and support as mentors. We don’t have to wait for someone less advance(ph) than you to ask for our assistance or a bit of our time in order for us to extend ourselves beyond the silos of our own personal and professional lives. The words of our (inaudible ) live 365 days a year, not just in the offices that we occupy in academic institutions like this. Each of us is blessed what I used to see other people's hardship, 365 days a year. Yes. Each of us is blessed with ears to hear other people's pain, 365 days a year. Each of us is blessed with hands to work 365 days a year. Each of us is blessed with two feet to march against injustice 365 days of year. Each of you is blessed with a voice to speak out against, right! inappropriate behavior in a faculty meeting, against injustice in an institution or against something going on crazy in your community, 365 days a year. What is it that about a mountain top that should inspire you to honor the legacy of the mentors that have helped and sacrificed for us? My counseling psychology family want you find your mountain top. Right and stay there a while to scope out the view. You have got come down off of your mountain and as I close, I remember looking back over my career and there is nothing that I'm prouder of than being a part of the psychology and counseling profession, I love being a psychologist that is what I was born to do. There is a (inaudible ) principle that simply says (inaudible ), it means one whose consciousness is aligned with one's destiny. My destiny is to be a healing presence in the lives of other people and my work as a scholar and a mentor has helped me hopefully to be able to align there. There is nothing I'm prouder of than what I do and I have sought to use my talent and skill in ways that both empathize with their challenges. I tried to help students develop strategies and my transform their lives and elevate their status to rightful places of ruler ship and mastery over their own circumstance and you know when all was set and done, what African wisdom teaches us is that an individual should be able to stand before the creator and his community and say, that I've done what the people love and God praised. And it is my sincere hope that the contributions I've made in all the domains expressed in this address had contributed to the betterment of the human condition. And I'm honored to receive this Janet E Helms Award today and I thank you for bestowing this honor on me, and hopefully what this award symbolizes is that I've done what the people loved and God praised and help those I've touched through my mentoring a scholarship to do the same. Thank you very much. God bless.
