Blustein Lynch School Education, Boston College Presented at the Diversity Challenge Conference Boston College October 22, 2005 

00:00:00
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN  Okay, I'm very honored to be here. 

00:00:40
The Psychology of Working: Expanding our Vision to Affirm Race and Culture. 

00:00:40
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN Uhm, we're gonna begin now. We, I have a lot to say, and I'll to try to say it in an interesting way, and, uhm, in a way that will give you a chance to participate as well. I have a few announcements to make at the outset. One is, ah, first of all, I'm David Blustein. That's one announcement. Uhm, I'm a faculty member of, in the counseling psych program here at Boston College. And I'm very honored to be asked to speak at this conference. I've been coming to these conferences for five years, and it's really been a goo, it's a great honor to be asked to be one of the invited speakers, specially on this topic which is so dear to me. Uhm, so just a few procedural announcements, one is that, uhm, for Continuing Ed. credits, ah, our grads, my grad student, Amy Coonerty-Femiano, will be handling a sign-out sheet. Is that correct? Is there a sign-in sheet? 

00:01:25
AMY Same one. 

00:01:25
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN  Same one. Can I get, continue with my credits of my own talk? Let's discuss that later. No, I guess not. Uhm, so, ah, see Amy if you're interested in, ah, APA, ah, CEUs, Continuing Ed. Units. Ah, second announcement is that this, ah, presentation is actually being videotaped for a DVD. I'm sure you're all gonna be at the video store the day it comes out. There'll be a big poster of me, I'm sure. Uhm, but actually, the reason why I'm saying that is that, uhm, I'm probably not gonna stray too far from up here, and that we wanna handle the question-and-answer period in a way that will allow your question and for, and if you as well to be on this DVD, which could be the start of a great career. Uhm, anyway, when that happens, Chris Hamilton, if you could just raise your hand, has the microphone, and will, uhm, help to facilitate the question-and-answer period. Okay? Uhm, the talk will go 'til up, I'm probably gonna speak for about an hour. Ah, then, we'll have about 15 minutes for questions and comments. So that's the procedural stuff, and now I will begin. That's me.

00:02:30
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN Ah, we have, I've handed out handouts of the powerpoints, ah, so you have my email address there if you wanna contact me about this. If you didn't have a chance to ask a question or make some comments, this is at, you could do that through email. Uhm, I wanna, uhm, thank people, and do a dedication here as well. Uhm, the people I wanna thank are, for the, Janet Helms, who is my, my colleague and friend at Boston College. She's on the Faculty in Counseling Psychology. She's also the Director of the ISPRC. She has organized this conference for the last five years, and we share a wall together. Ah, well, our offices are literally next toward to each other, and and I think we also share some common values and some common passions, and it's really been a great honor to work with her. I also wanna thank my colleagues at Boston College, ah, especially to Lynch School, and my faculty, the Faculty College in Counseling Psychology. One of them is here. Guerda Nicholas, I appreciate your being here. Uhm, tsk, I wanna also thank my, my brave and, my bright and brave students. I have a number of really wonderful students who have been very, very, uhm, amazing to me, very dedicated, and have followed me on this path I've taken about six years ago, where I've really made a sharp left turn in my career. I left both politically as well as, uhm, uhm, in other ways in terms of the way I'm working as a researcher. And I thank them for having confidence in this project. Uhm, some of them are probably getting a little sick of this book. Alex might be one of them, uhm, 'coz it's, it's really been an, and I'll talk about the book in a second. We've had a lot of, lot of work with this book. Ah, I also wanted, I wanna dedicate this to my parents, and, uhm, uhm, my father is very ill now so I, I, uhm, I just wanted to dedicate this to them, the, and I, I actually wrote this beforehand 'coz I knew I would get like emotional, but they really represent the hardworking and courageous workers who I have invested so much of my energy, and, and, uhm, they helped to lift our family out of poverty, out of, you know, well, really poverty. Uhm, they had a hundred dollars when, you know, when I went to college, so we were not wealthy. Uhm, and they also, I mean, my father is 92, and, uhm, and, you know, he's of that generation that fought World War II, and, you know, Tom Brokow wrote about it, and, you know, it's an issue that really in some ways, it even transcends this conference in terms of what my father and his colleagues did in that war, and, uhm, you know we're, we're saying goodbye to these World War II vets everyday, and, uhm, my daughter was down with me. My daughter is here as well. And my daughter was down, we've visited them last week, and my dad still remembers stories from World War II, and, uhm, it's just an amazing thing to grow up in that kind of environment, and I, I dedicate this work to them. And fortunately, before my father got ill they, they were able to attend a talk I gave in Florida in June, and, ah, I was able to acknowledge them publicly. So I feel very good about that, and the, them, the take-home message here is make sure you honor parents while they're able to hear it. Okay. Uhm, the goals of the presentation, to present a new perspective on working and careers. Uhm, and, ah, to do something which I think is really fundamental, and this is why I feel so honored to be here. I wanna reframe the figure and ground of psychological explorations of work, and what I mean by that is most of the studies of career, development, and work in Psychology of which I am one of the principal, I am one of the people who've, who've done a lot of those research studies. I'm critiquing a lot of my own work right now, and one of the things that we've done, I think, that hasn't been that effective is we have placed the people with choice and volition as the figure and the rest of the world as the ground. I'm, I'm reversing that. I wanna flip it right now. And I want the peo, the model worker or the people who wanna work to be the, the figure, and I'm not saying I'm, I don't care about people who have choice and volition. I do care about them. I'm one of them, my kids, my family, my friends, but they don't need as much help right now, and there's limited resources, and I'm, what I'm really about for the rest of my career is devoting every ounce of my energy to developing a scholarship, a way of practice that will affirm work for all people and will help to develop, ah, a body of knowledge that will change the way we, ways, we as counselors and psychologists do business, but also change the way the public thinks about work. So I have a very ambitious agenda here. Uhm, so, some additional goals I wanna discuss the interface between, uh, uh, of working, race, and culture. And as I've mentioned, I wanna develop a, ah, more socially conscious approach to career development and working. 

00:07:15
Current Views and Challenges The Traditional View of Career Counseling and Vocational Psychology: Strengths Great assessment tools Excellent theories for those with choices Limitations: Assumes people have choice and volition in their working lives 

00:07:15
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN All right. The current views of, uhm, Career Counseling and Vocational Psychology. And again, I note some of my colleagues in the field or in this audience, some people who, from around the country, and we've all done this kind of work, so I'm not critiquing, when I critique the field, I'm critiquing all of us, myself included. I've got tenure on studies that studied college students and people with choice and people who are affluent, and, ah, I'm not sorry I got the tenure, I'm glad I did. My daughter I'm sure is glad I did too. So, uh, I don't regret it, but it, uhm, getting that allowed me to go off into this direction, so, uhm, uhm, I, I do speak from a position here of some privilege which I'll talk about in a second, so it's, I have a little bit more opportunity to do this kind of, uhm, you know, provocative work. So the strengths of the traditional field of study of Career Counseling and Vocational Psychology is we've developed these great assessment tools, and I have done a lot of career counseling in my life. I had a practice, a clinical practice back in Albany, and about one-fourth of my clients were career counseling cases, and, you know, it was great work, and I used this strong interest inventory. I love it. I still think it's a great measure. Uhm, and we've also developed excellent theories for clients who have choices and volition. We've got great theories. People have been referencing these theories throughout this conference. Donald Super, John Holland, you know, they're great scholars, great people. I know them well. I knew Super well. Uhm, and Industrial Organizational Psychologies had an equally illustrious, ah, run as a field. Uhm, I have a lot more to say about that field actually in my book, uhm, which I should put one plug-in for right now. The book is not done yet. I hoped it would been done so we could sell it out here. Only 'coz I would have been done with it. Uhm, the book, uh, I've been working on this book since, actually it's a very momentous date, September 10th, 2001, Right before 9/11, I sent in the proposal, and I've written, as Alex unfortunately knows, well over 600 manuscript pages of text, uhm, and about 80 pages of references, which is growing as we speak. Uhm, and the book is called "The Psychology of Working: Colleen A New Perspective for Career Development, Counseling and Public Policy." It'll, published by Earlbaum Associates, it'll be out in the early winter. Uhm, and any of those, those of you who are in Counseling Psych or in NC, National Career, about, Development Association, will probably be sent a brochure. Ah, you'll see it around, I hope. Uhm, tsk, and what I'm doing today is I'm summarizing a lot of what's in the book, and I've got some new ideas here as well. Uhm, so, uhm, the traditional field has done a great job with people who have, uh, who are privileged, who have education, and who have had resources, and we've devoted the last hundred years to this privileged group, and we've done a great job. I mean, the Career Counseling works. There's research studies that show it works, and it works well. Uhm, and we know a lot about the career development process, career decision-making uhm, and organizational psychologists also have some great research data, very sophisticated models, very compelling methodologies, but there's a big question mark here. Uhm, the issue is that all of these fields, American U.S. Psychology has really focused, when its studied work has focused on the privileged, and the affluent, and those with choice. 

00:10:35
Consider the Following Two Individuals: Immigrant from South Asia Business Owner in Urban Community 

00:10:35
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN Let me, let me read you, uhm, two vignettes, just to give you a sense of what I'm trying to look at here. The first case is an immigrant from South Asia who worked as an engineer in her home country. Upon arriving to her new home in London, England, she learns that she does not have the appropriate credentials to continue in her chosen field. How does she face the task of moving into the workforce? How does her view of working and of life itself become transformed as her hopes to work in a field that suits her interest are suddenly dashed and she must look for whatever will help her to survive. So that's one of the first fundamental questions. Ah, the second case is an African-American woman who owns a printing shop in an urban community. Her business has helped her to make a decent living and has given her a sense of autonomy that was not available to her parents and grandparents. However, an office supplies chain moves into her area with a cheaper printing department forcing her income to drop precipitously. Her dreams of self-sufficiency and economic empowerment fade as she confronts the lower prices and greater efficiency of her competition. These are just two of thousands and thousands of stories that as a counselor, as a therapist, you will hear from people, uhm, who are struggling with work-related issues. Let me go over the, uh, a little bit more of the Rationale for a New Perspective. Uhm, in counseling theory and practice, the study of working has been split off from other domains of human experience. It's, I've done a lot of therapy in my career. I've done a tremendous amount of reading in the area and I would ask you as who are, those of you who are therapists to look at the literature and see what you can find that's been written about work, and you'll, it will be very, very little. If you do a search for the word work, it'll mostly be referring to the treatment work. Therapists don't really deal with the concept of work. Uhm, I seek to place working at the same level of attention for, for therapists and for social and behavioral sciences, scientists as all other major life concerns like intimate relationships, physical and mental health, and socio-economic inequities. Uhm, I want to talk here a little bit about me, and what brings me up here, and what I come into this with. 

00:12:55
White Privilege and Working The important lessons that need to be learned are often experiential and can be evocative, and even painful. The pain of racism and oppression. The pain of thwarted dreams. The pain of examining how privilege has contributed to inequity. Review Tools for Tomorrow example... 

00:12:55
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN Uhm, there's no question about the fact that I'm a white male. You all see that. Uhm, that's, that's who I am. I've been that my whole life obviously. Uhm, tsk, and I think that, uhm, I need to be very open when I do a talk like this about my own privilege in obtaining the education and training and access to resources that help me to get to this point in my life. Uhm, and I also need to openly talk about my own privilege and how I've been transformed by working in, in marginalized communities, working with poor, working folks of color. I'll just tell you a brief story. Ah, I have a project with Dr., with Maureen Kenny here called "Tools for Tomorrow." It's a project in the Boston public schools in the ninth grade, and, uhm, we work with inner-city kids trying to help them internalize the connection between school and work, thereby trying to help them develop more motivation to do their work, do their schoolwork. And, uhm, I was fond of developing new exercises. I used to do these, you know, not physical exercises, but, you know, a curriculum. I made it out like I knew what I was doing. Uhm, the reality is most psychologists don't know how to write educational curriculum, and we think we might, but, boy, do we not know what we're doing there. So I wrote these things up, and sometimes the teachers would say, "David, it's well meaning but it's gonna fall flat on its face." And, you know, the implication was you don't really know what you're doing over here. You've never really been, you haven't been in high school since 1970. Uhm, so, uhm, I developed this exercise called the "Exploring History of the World of Work", uhm, where we were, I asked students to list the main occupations, like the things that they were, would think were prevalent occupations in 1950, the main occupations now, and then the occupations that will be prevalent 50 years from now. And, uhm, one of the students then called out in the class while I was running the class, said, "Yeah, it's all well and good, but these jobs won't be open to me because I'm black," and, uhm, my decision then was to process it and talk about it, and in many ways, uhm, issues of race or the "elephant in the room" when we talk about work. And what I wanna do is really open that conversation up. I think it's a critical conversation. We need to have it. Racism exist and racism is very clearly manifested in education and equally manifested in the world of work. And, uhm, as I, as I've written about, in some ways, the world of work is, is one of the major playing fields for inequity, which also means it's one of the places where we can make major changes. Uhm, okay, some of the goals for this new perspective, I would like to, it's a bit ambitious I know. 

00:15:30
Goals for a new Perspective Develop explanatory theoretical statements in the years to come. Develop inclusive modes of counseling/therapy practice that will provide services for people without much choice in their lives and that will help people deal assertively with the unequal opportunity structure. Generate new knowledge, leading to greater engagement in public policy about education, training, labor policy, and employment issues. 

00:15:30
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN Develop explanatory theoretical statements in, in the years to come. Not just me, but I'm hoping to, you know, inspire other people to do this work, to, to kinda follow along with me, not, not behind me, but with me, 'coz I really wanna be influenced by my colleagues and students. Uhm, I'm also arguing that we need to develop inclusive modes of counseling and therapy that will provide services for people who don't have much choice in their lives. Most of the theories of psychotherapy that we read about are really based on, on YAVIS clients, you know, the young, or, I forgot what it stands for, young, articulate, verbal, intelligent, and successful. Ah, I used to call them the YAVIS or yuppie clients. Uhm, and we need to really develop theories in models and perspectives that will work with, that will be helpful for everybody who, who's in our office or who needs to be in our offices. Okay? Uhm, tsk, and I'm also hoping that we will do, generate knowledge that will inform public policy. I'm very, I mean, I've, I've kind of up the ante in my own life that for me, I wanna really influence public policy. I mean I'd, it's nice to publish in journal articles, and that's the kind of "coin of the realm" in our lives as academics, but, you know, the Senator Kennedy's office is not within, you know, the journal of Counseling Psychology. Ah, I know it's shocking because as a faculty member, I'm telling my students, "You need to publish in these journals. You're gonna have an impact on the field." Well, I wanna have an impact in public policy, and I think that we can do it, and I have some ideas of how we could do that. I think we need to influence education, training, labor policy, and employment issues. And in fact, the last chapter of my book, which some have said is the best because it is the last, uhm, ah, is all about public policy. All right, let me give you a little bit of background in terms of my use of the term "work" and "working" as opposed to career. Ah, and again, I come from the world of career development. That's where I have a reputation, albeit in a, in a circumscribed world. Uhm, the term "career" was the, was actually been around for, you know, hundreds of years, and I go into detail about the ideology of the word, but, uhm, when Super really promoted this idea of career development in the 1950s, he was really, he, he was inadvertently, I think, embedding the notion of work into an affluent, relatively well-educated context in advanced Western countries. It's the, it's the world that I remember from when we lived back in Westchester, Laurice(ph) and I, and we would take the train into Manhattan of, you know, the, ah, people wearing suits and ties, of which I would never wear a suit and tie, uhm, okay, except for weddings and funerals, but, ah, so I always felt a little out of place there, but that was the traditional careerist. Uhm, his, Super's objective was to build a perspective that would explore work-related issues across the life span and life space. It was an amazingly important, uhm, uhm, innovation in the field. I, I don't mean to diminish Super's contributions, uhm, but I think we need to move on. 

00:18:25
Work and Career Super also sought to create a discourse that would embed the study of work across the life space within the complex texture of contemporary life, replete with shifting roles. These objectives are still quite admirable and fit well with a psychology of working; however, they limit our scope and vision. In effect, the notion of career and career development are subjects of a broader psychology of working. 

00:18:25
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN  His book in 1957 was the psychology of careers, and mine is the psychology of working. I know it's a big grandiose to put my book next to his, and I'm probably getting ahead of myself, but that's my fantasy really, that, that this stuff that I will do will lead to a psychology of working. Okay? Uhm, so Super sought to create this discourse that embedded work across the life space. Uhm, and he did a great job with that. He was a brilliant scholar. He knew Sociology well. Uhm, however, the, uhm, the reality is that career development and the study of careers in my view ought to be a subset of a broader psychology of working. I'm not saying we shouldn't study the world of the affluent and those with choice. We still should do that, but, ah, we shouldn't put 90 percent of our resources to that. And that's what we do in our field right now. If you look at the journals, look at the conference presentations, that's exactly what we're doing. All right, let me discuss with you, uhm, the psychological meaning of work. 

00:19:25
Psychological Meaning of Working Working is one of the constants in our lives; the experience of working unifies human beings across time frames and cultures. Working includes effort, activity, and human energy in given tasks that contribute to the overall social and economic welfare of a given culture. Working includes paid employment as well as work that one does in caring for others within one's family and community. 

00:19:25
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN  See, people are starting to come in now because the talk about this presentation is, (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:19:34
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN  yeah, it's, ah, it's getting out there. Uhm, okay. (Audience laughing) Uhm, I'm trying to be very serious here, so, my students who've had me in class know that I have a hard time maintaining both seriousness and focus. And I think you ought to know, staff from the faculty meetings too, right? Okay, working is one of the constants in our lives. Uhm, and in fact, whenever I say that, I go back to, ah, uhm, ah, a Joni Mitchell song, uhm, and the line that I love there, it's called A Case of You. And I think this is so interesting because it is a constant in our lives, but as she says in that song, she's talking about a relationship, and she says, you're, you're constantly in the dark, you, you're as constant as the northern star, constantly in the dark, now where is that at? So it's, work is constant but still think our knowledge of it is in the dark. We don't really have a, a knowledge of how people experience work and working, okay? We have a very superficial knowledge of that. Uhm, and working un, unifies people across time frames and cultures. I travel a lot. I'm very fortuned to travel a lot, and I've, when I talk to people from different cultures, the, being united around our experience of working is a major common bond, major common bond. And it's, you know, it's something that is very constant in our lives. Uhm, working in, in my view includes effort, activity, human energy, uhm, which is all devoted to improving the overall social and economic welfare of a given culture, and also helping us to survive, which I'll talk about in a second. Uhm, working also in, it inclu, in my view, and not everybody agrees with this in the field, it includes paid employment as well as work that, that we do in caring for others within our families and communities. It includes caring for children, caring for elderly, caring for, uhm, individuals with disabling conditions. You know, as, as psychologist, we tend to forget about the whole range of work that people do. A lot of us go home and we start a whole another job, of parenting or elderly, ah, caregiving. And, uhm, I'm not saying that that caregiving is work exclusively. What I'm suggesting is that it's, uhm, that aspects of it are, are, are elements of work, and that there also elements of, of relational life. Okay, uhm- 

00:21:50
Methods of Exploring the Psychology of Working Traditional social scientific research Reviews of existing literature in psychology Expanding the scope to embrace other lines of social science research, including anthropology, sociology, education, and labor economics. 

00:21:50
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN - some of the methods I've used to explore the psychology of working, on a, I'm a natural born social scientist, and, uhm, I've obviously used the traditional literature. I love the traditional literature. I'm, ah, uhm, you know, I haven't, I haven't move that far away from my roots so I, my book does include, as Alex knows, way too many references, right? We're trying to delete them now though, aren't we? How many have I deleted, like three? Not that many. Uhm, I want everybody to be cited in there. 'Coz I have so many friends in the field, I don't want them to feel hurt that I didn't cite their work. Ah, part of it is that, I'm always worried that I won't cite this one person and will say, Kimpy(ph) didn't cite me. Uhm, and I'll just say it was, I did a poor literature review. Uhm, okay, I also, uhm, I've, I've, I've expanded the scope of my thinking to include fields outside of psychology. I've included anthropology, sociology, education, and labor economics. I've really become a student of the rest of the social sciences. I'm not a scholar in these fields, I'm clearly a student, and I urge all of you, when we do this work, to be humble when we go into our sister fields, okay? It's easy to go into anthropology and critique the methodology but you're, you're, you're entering that field as a student at that point. Uhm, I've also been very invested in what I call the Experience-Near Explorations. 

00:23:15
Experience-Near Explorations The pain and joy of working has generally been outside of psychological discourse - it is often an afterthought. Consistent with Mary Sue Richardson's view, I believe that avoidance of working in psychological theory and practice represents a collusion to avoid issues pertaining to racism, classism, and other forms of oppression. 

00:23:15
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN And this concept of experience-near, it comes from my background in, as a therapist doing relationing(ph)-oriented therapy, and really believe in, in my heart and in my mind that we need to really get empathically close to our patients or clients. And I believe we need to do the same thing in a, in a discipline like this where our goal is to, my goal in writing this book has been to transform the readers. I want readers to be emotionally transformed as well as intellectually transformed. So I've really tried hard to do that. Uhm, I also have, I also argue, as, in this, I, I take this argument from Mary Sue Richardson who is a great colleague and friend of mine from NYU, that, uhm, that as psychotherapists have avoided issues of work in our, in treatment that I believe it represents an unconscious or even conscious collusion to avoid issues pertaining to racism, classism, poverty, and other forms of oppression. That when we don't deal with work in therapy, we act as if everybody comes in with the same kind of privilege, and that's really not accurate. So I'm also hoping to really push the psychotherapy field forward. All right, ah, in terms of enhancing the experience, I've, I've, I, throughout this book, 600 manuscript pages, I've used various kinds of memoirs. I've used excerpts from novels. I haven't really used films, I don't know why I put that in there. Uhm, plays, I have used plays, stories and poems, and music. Now, I don't include the CD with the, uhm, with this particular book but I do have a lot of, ah, lyrics in there from, from songs. 'Coz my view is that, we as psychologists, we as social scientists and behavioral scientists, need to learn more about the, ah, about the experience of people we're working with. And I think there's an experienced distant relationship that even I who come from, ah, a working class family, have with poor working class folks. I do not live in that world anymore. I'm aware of it, I'm a boundary crosser, and, uhm, uhm, I'm, I'm, I'm just not in that world anymore. And in order for me emotionally close, we need to push ourselves. So one way of doing that is, uhm, through music, and, ah, I am going to, uhm, hold on, play a song from Marvin Gaye called What's Happening Brother. (music plying) And I'll show the lyrics to you as well. Let me stop there first, I gotta set the song up. It's like the journey(ph), remember the, on, on, on a talk show, you gotta set up the clip? You know, when somebody's promoting a song, I have to set the clip up. Okay, here's the story. Marvin Gaye in 1969, he's depressed. Tammi Terrell just died of brain tumor. Anybody remember this era? Okay, Tammi Terrell just died, they, they were good friends, they weren't lovers, as far as I know. But, uhm, they were very dear friends, and Marvin Gaye was very depressed. His brother was a soldier in Vietnam, and he was really, really, really profoundly affected by civil rights and by the Vietnam War. And he wrote, in me, in my view, one of the most beautiful, ah, pieces of music in the last 50 years, the album, What's Going On, which is a gorgeous symphony of protest music. One of the most important pieces of music I've ever heard. I mean, I get goosebumps describing it. And this song, What's Happening Brother, uhm, was, uhm, the, the lyrics are really Marvin Gaye's brother, Franky, talking to Marvin about his experience coming back from Vietnam, okay? So put yourself back in 1970, Detroit, and that's the set up of the clip. Okay, we're gonna go back to the beginning.

What's the deal man, what's happening What's happening brother Ah what's happening brother What's happening my man Ah what's happening brother What's been shaken up and down the line I want to know cause I'm slightly behind the time. 

00:26:45
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN  Thank you to Gary Glass(ph) for helping me with that. We should really congratulate Marvin Gaye for that piece of music. Even though he passed away, it's good to know his music still lives and it's inspiring people. Uhm, I'm gonna do another kype, type of experience-near, uhm, uhm, reading for you, actually. This is from a beautiful, beautiful piece of literature from England by Alan Sillitoe. Who wrote amazing novels. The guy had, ah, ah, left school at 16. He wrote these classic novels in the '50s and '60s, ah, The Loneliness of a Long Distance Runner. These were great films, great black and white films, I used to watch in my apartment in Queens. And in Saturday Night, Sunday Morning, this particular excerpt is from Saturday Night, Sunday Morning. And, uhm, this is a description of a man who's working in a factory and is going back to work on Monday morning. And if you just, if you don't mind, I'll just read it. "Arthur reached in his capstain lathe and took off his jacket, hanging it on a nearby nail so that he could keep and eye on his belongings. He pressed the starter button, and his motor came to life with a gentle thump. Looking around, it did not seem, despite the infernal noise of hurrying machinery, that anyone was working with particular speed. He smiled to himself, and picked up a glittering steel cylinder from the top box of a pile beside him, and fixed it onto the spindle. He jettisoned his cigarette into the sud-pan, drew back the capstain, and swung the turret into its broadest drill. Two minutes had passed while he contemplated the precise position of tools and cylinder; finally he spat onto both hands and rubbed them together, then switched on the sud-tap from the mo, movable brass pipe, pressed a button that set the spindle running, and ran in the drill to a neat chamber. Monday morning had lost its terror." That says so much about going back to work on a Monday, doesn't it? That most of us who live privileged live don't even think about. But think about that experience. I know when I was younger, I had jobs I hated, how I hated Sunday night. Don't you hate that Sunday night coming around? Well, that's, that's the world that most people inhabit. Okay, so it's with this deep reservoir of material that I've been exploring for the last six years, that I kind of, uhm, and also integrating with the social science literature, that I came up with a very, uhm, kind of brief taxonomy of psychological needs and working. The first need I talk about is the need for survival and power. The second need is the need for social connections. And the third is the need for self-determination. So I'm gonna give you a brief overview of, of these needs. 

00:32:15
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN The first function of working, in my view, is survival and power, which is actually, uhm, obviously very common. I mean, if you were to go back and ask your grandparents why do people work, that's what they would tell you. This was the psychology that Stanley Schachter used to call "bubba psychology." In other words, psychology of our grandparents, which is, has a lot of wisdom actually. And, as there, psychologist-therapist, we just kinda blew this one by, 'coz we were all pretty well doing well with survival. But if you've sat in therapy sessions with, with patients who've been poor or who've lost their jobs, you know, that this issue around work and survival is critical. It's not a, it's not an afterthought. Uhm, I, in, in, in the book I've written I've done a lot of reading to explore the evolutionary history of work, and it's a fascinating, fascinating literature. It's mostly in the antro, anthropology field. And basically, if you go back to the, you know, our old history, we basically, everyday was a struggle of work and survival. I mean, that was the, every day's bottom line. You get up during the day, you figure out, "Oh, what am I gonna do today? Am I gonna eat dairy or meat? Am I gonna go out an try to get some berries or am I gonna go out and," you know, we don't wanna think about that, how we would like, get our hamburgers and steak. I mean, it involve a little bit of violence. Uhm, but if you go back and you think about that, well, it's a wonder I didn't became a vegetarian with all of this, but, uhm, uhm. So work was essential to our lives when we live back and when we were first developing. Uhm, and as societies became more complex and multi-layered, work became more varied. One of the movements was movement from hunting-gathering communities to agricultural lifestyles, that was a major transition. And it's still occurring in, in, in a, in a number of communities around the world. That transition actually led to the notions of land ownership, and with land ownership came the issues of land acquisition and social power. Uhm, the second function of work is the need for social connection. Uhm, in this, this actually builds on work I've done for the last ten years, where I've, integrated relational perspectives with career development. That was kind of one of my early left turns. This has been a more, a sharper left turn in my work. Ah, so the second function focuses on the role of work in providing people with the means of social connection. And actually, I think of this in two ways. The fundamental way I think of this is that work for many, many people provides them with a way to connect to the world, to meet new people. I mean, I, I'm fortunate that I can work from home, Fair Mount(ph). But if I work from home two or three days in a row, especially in the summer when, you know, it's really quite, sometimes I say to myself, I think I better go to the university today. I just, you know, I wanna see Gird(ph), I wanna see this, see Dianne, I wanna see, you know, just say hello to somebody, you know. So there's that social connection piece, you know. I wanna see my students there, back in the cubbies. Remember I'm the cubby, cubby policy monk, inside joke for my students. Uhm, so the rudimentary level work gives us direct contact with other people, okay? And I do have some funny, I have some, very small quips in my book about, you know, there are some jobs that don't provide that, and I did talk about the Maytag repairman. Remember that commercial, remember the Maytag guy never got called? Okay, moving right along. Uhm, tsk, so from the psychoanalytic perspective, from attachment theory perspectives, we are really hard-wired to be in connection with others. We, we get our emotional fuel from others, and it's really part of who we are as human beings. As, as Coldwatt(ph) said, we need relationships like we need the air. Ah, we need the oxygen in the air that we breathe. Uhm, and also, there's a secondary more late in latent function of work as a means of social connection and that is, uhm, by, by working, we're able to contribute to the overall social and economic aspects of our lives. Here, I will walk in back to my parents again. My father worked as a sheet metal mechanic at the Pan American, and my mom worked as a, ah, work in the cosmetics department of a, of a relatively low-level department store from Queens. Anybody here from the New York City area? Do you remember Mays Department Store? My, probably before all of your time. But my mom worked in the cosmetics department. So my parents had, as they said, they didn't have glamorous jobs. But what they always told me was, you know, we go to work, and we, we, we, we're contributing to something, you know? My father believed in Pan Am Airlines a lot, to the point that, uhm, he would get people who are falling asleep in the toilet, 'coz they were avoiding work, he would slam the toilet bowl down to get them to go back to work. They sleep in there. And then you said pix, this is actually true, they had softball leagues on company time. And my father said, "This company is gonna go bankrupt if you guys don't get back to work." He was right actually. He was so unpopular that they, he was the only person I know, they made him retirement party after he left. 'Coz he was a thorn in the side of the people who weren't hard workers. So they believe in hard work, ah, and they believe in this contribution to, whatever organization you work in, you believe in it and you do the best you can for it. Uhm, so working helps people to feel less isolated. It provides a consistent source of social connection. And it, ideally, at its best, work can provide the relational resources we need to flourish. It can also provide a lot stress as well, which we'll get into. So work can function in both ways. Okay, working and caregiving. I've, I've devoted a fair amount of time in my book to this issue. Uhm, because first of all, I think caregiving is not an, ah, issue for women or feminist alone, it's an issue for all scholars, and therapist, and psychologist. It's not a women's issue, it's an everyone issue. And, uhm, as my daughter will tell you, I'm, I'm, ah, I think I've been a very good caregiver in my life, uhm. So, I, and I think it's something very, very important. Uhm, so caregiving includes taking care of children, taking care of the sick or disabled family members, and taking care of the elderly. And it's, it's a big part of our lives. And it's something that scholars of work need to be aware of. Okay, the third, the third function of working is that, is, uhm, the needs for self-determination. And here, I'm borrowing freely, although I cite them a lot, as Alex has probably left to go to some more citations for me, uhm, and she'd been complaining lately about these citations, uhm. Okay, the third need is based on the potential for working to become self-determined. Work can also, can often be very disinteresting, physically arduous and even painful. And, you know, I've had jobs like that. I've had jobs where I used to have to get up. I live in Queens, I have to get up, I have to leave my apa, my apartment at six in the morning to get to the South Bronx by eight in the morning. And then, I worked at the Grand Concourse, 138th Street. It was a, it was a rough area in the 1970s. It was like Beirut. It's all torn down, it was, it was like there was a war there, and still is. Yeah, I worked there and, uhm, I was not very popular at the time but, ah, you know, I was the long haired, kinda college kid, and, uhm, tsk, you know, it's a very hard job. And the thing I took about, is I need the connections to get that job. I still don't understand that. I needed a, I needed a lot of connections, 'coz I was born at the peak of the baby boom. You couldn't get a job at McDonalds, even if your last name was McDonald. And this is 1970, '71, so, ah, it was a very tough time to get a job. But, you know, it was an arduous job, working in a hot warehouse. Hot, hot, hot, and then going out making deliveries to candy stores. Uhm, my students have heard some stories about that. Okay, uhm, so work can be painful physically, physiologically denigrating. However, work is not unidimensional, it also can satisfy, uhm, and give us great deal of satisfaction. I'm very privileged to have a job like that, a job that I love going to work everyday, well maybe not everyday. I don't like Tuesday's, I will say that. Uhm, under optimal conditions, working also can lead to the experience of self-determination. 

00:40:25
Self-Determination Theory: - In motivational psychology, Deci and Ryan advanced a theory of self-determination that conceptualizes motivation as an internal resource that can explain many aspects of human behavior, including tasks that involve activities that are not necessarily intrinsically interesting. 

00:40:25
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN Now, let me go a little, go over a little bit of what I think about self-determination. I've used the, the motivational, uhm, research here of, ah, Deci and Ryan who are brilliant scholars from the University of Rochester who developed this theory of self-determination which is a very provocative, humanistic theory of motivation in a world where motivation theory is usually very psychoanalytic or very behavioristic, and Deci and Ryan took the third way, remember the psychology's third way? The humanistic existential approach? Well, they took the third way with empirical research and they developed a wonderful body of knowledge that I think is very relevant to the psychology of working. They basically conceptualize motivation as an internal resource that can explain many aspects of human behavior that may be intrinsically interesting or may not be. They've conceptualized motivation, the intrinsic motivation is the most desirable state of self-determined functioning. So when you're intrinsically interested in something, you'll love doing it. I love working on this book. There were few times when I didn't like, I don't, I'm not enjoying the copy editing phase, I will say that. But I love writing this book to the point that, you know, if I had a day off, I couldn't wait to work on it and I would save it. I would savor the moments working on the book. Uhm, I'm ready to write my next one now actually. Uhm, so I was very intrinsically motivated to do it, that's why I had trouble stopping it which is why it's so long. Uhm, however, some aspects of extrinsically motivated activities can be in, internally regulated and can help people to lead what Deci and Ryan called self-determined lives. So basically, they conceptualized motivation along three dimensions. Uhm, first is intrinsic motivation which is, you know, doing something out of just curiosity or sheer pleasure. Extrinsic motivation, which is, uhm, let's say when I'm, uhm, doing the graduate assistantship assignments in the spring. I wouldn't say I enjoy the work but I know it's important and I do it, and it's kind of, uhm, you know, it's something I get ex, extrinsic motivation coz the students are all happy. They get assistantships, they're very content, they go to school for another year, they don't develop great huge debts and, ah, they're all content most of the time. Uhm, and then there's lack of motivation, which is if you just don't wanna do the activity at all, you really don't want, wanna do it. So the question I raised as I began to think about self-determination theory in light of, of work is to what extent are most workers intrinsically motivated? And that's an empirical question, we don't know the answer to that at this point. My view though, my hunches from the research I've done is that there are not enough intrinsically motivating jobs for all the workers in the world. So the question that we need to pose is, how can we help people find meaning at work when their tasks are not intrinsically motivating or interesting? So Deci and Ryan have actually articulated three contextual elements or dimensions. That they believe will help to foster self-determination. The first of these is autonomy, and autonomy in some ways is, is, in some ways the, uhm, the prevalent, the most predominant kind of contextual factor. So when individuals feel autonomous, they're much more likely to find the activity motivating, which leads us to believe that when we really micromanage people in the work place or we do a lot of reinforcement and take away reinforcements, if that's gonna take away our autonomy, that is in fact how Deci and Ryan came about their work as a critique of the learning paradigms of the '60's and '70's, which they felt was robbing people of their intrinsic enjoyment of activities that they hereto forehead enjoyed before we started reinforcing them. The second, uhm, aspect, contextual aspect, uhm, is competence. And, uhm, competence is, is, really fits in beautifully to the educational reform movement which is not so beautiful right now. Uhm, competence reflects, uhm, the idea that we need to give people the skills they need to perform given tasks. If we give them the skills, they're more likely to find those, that activity self-determining. And then the third is relatedness. Yeah, it's true, you see relatedness in a lot of the different bodies of work that, that I read. And I, I think it's no accident. I think that, uhm, as we move forward with psychology, we move it away from the male-dominated Eurocentric approaches, we're moving back to, ah, an endorsement of a collectivist approach to being in the world and to a relational approach to being in the world, and an approach where we're not denigrating desires to be in connection. And in this concept of self-determination, Deci and Ryan have articulated clearly that having relational support can help foster self-determined functioning. What I want to talk about now is, is social barriers and working, and this where we get into the interface of race and racism with work and working. Uhm, in order to understand the experience, particularly the experience of African-Americans in the, in United States, we need to understand the legacy of slavery. And to understand the legacy of slavery, we need to not just read statistics. I think we need to read the ex, read about the experiences of slaves. And in my research on this book, I came across this amazing quote from Booker T. Washington, it's actually found in the Oxford Book of Work, which is actually, ah, a remainder. Now, you can get it for five bucks. So I recommend it, it's a great compendium of excerpts about working. I'm gonna read this to you as well. This is from Booker T. Washington's recollections of being a slave as a young kid. "I was asked not long ago to tell something about the sports and pastimes that I engaged in during my youth. Until that question was asked, it had never occurred to me that there was no period of my life that was devoted to play. From the time that I can remember anything, almost every day of my life has been occupied in some kind of labor, though I think I would now be a more useful man if I had time for sports. Uhm, during the period that I spent in slavery, I was not large enough to be of much service. Still, I was occupied most of the time in cleaning the yards, carrying water to the men in the fields, or going to the mill, to which I used to take corn, once a week, to the ground. The mill was about three miles from the plantation. This work I always dreaded. The heavy bag of corn would be thrown across the back of the horse, and the corn divided about evenly on each side, but in some way, almost without exception, on these trips, the corn would so shift as to become unbalanced and would fall off the horse, and often I would fall with it. As I was not strong enough to reload the corn upon the horse, I would have to wait, sometimes for many hours, till a chance passer-by came along who would help me out of my trouble. The hours while waiting for someone were usually spent in crying. The time consumed in this way made me late in reaching the mill, and by the time I got my corn ground and reached home, it would be far into the night. The road was a lonely one, and often led through dense forests. I was always frightened. The woods were said to be full of soldiers who had deserted from the army, and I had been told that the first thing a deserter did to a Negro boy when he him alone was to cut his ears. Besides, when I was late in getting home, I knew I would always get a severe scolding or a flogging. So in my view, in order to understand the experience of people of color in relation to work, we need to really understand the legacy of how work was experienced and that legacy is one of, of slavery, and that quote is just one vista into that world. Uhm, it's hard to move from that quote back to psychology in some ways, but, uhm, that's a different sort of psychology. It's, it's, in my view, that's the work we need to do more and more of, which is to really understand the inner experience of the, of, of the issue in people were studying. Uhm, so let me, let me talk a little bit more about social barriers and working and offer, uhm, ah, a conceptual foundation of sort. This is one of a number of conceptual foundations I, I have developed in, in the book project. I used social categorization theory here, just as a kind of meta-perspective to understand what happens to folks who are in some ways different from the European American norm. Uhm, so social categorization theory provides a means of understanding how human beings establish various sorts of out-groups within their individual collective, ah, social economic interactions. So in reality, social categories, it functions as a way to help us with our social cognition. In other words, it's a kind of, you know heuristic, it's kind of shortcut. But the reality is that, you know, we're not that good at this, and we've got all kinds of affect and emotion tied up with this. We've got all kinds of, uhm, biases and, and, uhm, kind of really off-the-wall beliefs. I'm sorry to use such colloquial terms about different people that, that really distorts our, our social cognition's. So essentially, people are categorized into groups that are based on demographic or phenotypic attributes. Ah, and these social categories often function, as we know, to stratify access to resources. And we've heard about this at this conference. And if you open up your ears and you open up your eyes, you'll hear about it every single day. If you'll look around, you'll see it every single day. So the existence of racism, classism, sexism, heterosexism, uhm, other forms of oppression obviously creates a very unequal playing field, and we have got a number of scholars in this room who have been writing about this for many years, who by the way I give great credit to coz this, in many ways, it's on their shoulders that I've tried to build a lot of this work. Uhm, and here's a quote from somebody who, ah, we do know. It's, ah, from Janet Helms, this outstanding classic book. Uhm, uhm, then I'm just gonna read it here. Ah, when a person is perceived as being a member of a racial group, then the person's âracialâ demographic identity typically obliterates his or her membership in other demographic categories or social affiliations. So the point that, that, that Janet and, and her colleague, Donelda Cook, made in this is that race really triumphs all, all other forms of social categories. And I know it's, some folks may not agree with that but I'm, I'm just presenting this as a view that I, I've really learned to really, uhm, to, to take in. I think it's actually quite accurate. So access to society's rewards and punishments is more often based on one's alleged racial characteristics than on any other real or fictive human characteristics. So it's a great quote. Uhm, so race and culture and the psychology of working. 

00:50:55
African Americans, Latino, Native Americans, Asian Americans and other people of color experience pronounced discrimination in nearly every aspect of their social and economic interactions. 

00:50:55
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN  Okay. Uhm, obviously, the, uhm, the, the dis, the, the disadvantages that people of color face in the world of work are really profound. And, you know, I have my, in my notes here all kinds of statistics but I, I made a comment yesterday that, I think presenting the statistics doesn't do justice to this because it's really a moral argument. Even if two people were affected by this, that would be two more than, than should be the case. Uhm, so the reality is that there's enormous discrimination in education and in job training and in the world of work in all aspects of education and career development that clearly affect how people relate to work and how they experience work. 

00:51:45
Race and Culture and the Psychology of Working 

00:51:45
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN  You know, just, this is, I just want to lift this just briefly that people of color in the U.S. earn less money for essentially the same work. We heard that this morning from Tim Weiss' talk. Ah, they're exposed to more violent and unhealthy housing. They're provided with less than adequate education and they're biased in every, in nearly every aspect of their educational and vocational development. In fact, I was having lunch the other day with a friend here on campus, and we noticed that, uhm, it was the Hillside CafÃ© which is my favorite place to eat here. And all the people serving us food were people of color and almost all of the students sitting there and on line and the faculty were, were European American. And I was very cognizant of it. So it, it's so pervasive out there that, you know, if you open up your eyes, you'll see it. And I asked the students when I got up to the line after I gave my order, of course, and I was eating my first potato chip. Uhm, I said, âSo you got, are you students here?â Yeah, they are students but they're probably on work-study but it was just a weird phenomenon to have students of color serving us here at Boston College 2005, a place of social justice, liberation theology, uhm, that we still see it right here in our own campus. Uhm, and it was very awkward actually. So the lack, the lack of access is evident everywhere you look. Uhm, so in, in order to understand racism, I also wanted, I wanna touch on racism at the workplace as well. I know Robert Carter who just was in here is going to talk about that more in the next talk. So this is a kind of, uhm, you know, just a little bit of a, uhm, uhm, appetizer, if you will. Why are all of my metaphors are based on food? Jenna, why is that? (laughs) It's very good. Okay, good. Uhm, the actual experience of working for people of color is best understood by, by reading the words of people who have had to face the unequal playing field. And I've used a number of, one book I've used a lot in my book was, uh, William Julius Wilson's book, âWhen Work Disappears.â And I, I've had some issues with some of the inferences in the book but in many ways, it's a very profound and important book. And, uhm, he's gotta, he uses a qualitative and quantitative methodology. Ah, it's a methodology I would love to use in a big project like that. And of course, I would like to get that multimillion dollar grant also but, uhm, uhm. And so he talks about, uhm, the effect of the loss of jobs in urban communities. And in at Wilson's book, he documents this very compellingly that the loss of, of, of, of employment in the inner city of Chicago, in his view, and is, is, is costly related to the, to the, to the chaos that ensued in the urban core of our, many of our cities. That once people lost work, they lost their hope, they lost their ability to, to, to, to feel part of their community. Drug abuse increased, violence increased, uhm, you know, gangs increased. So when those, when those, those factories left the South Bronx, when they left the south side of Chicago, we lost more than just jobs. We lost, in my view and in Wilson's view, we lost the stabilizing nature that work functions in our lives. And it gives us a structure, gives us a way to connect to the world, and also pays our bills. Uhm, but in this book, he also, uhm, interviewed a number of employers who talked about their, their reactions to interviewing urban candidates for jobs, tsk. And, uhm, here's one of the excerpts from Wilson's book. Okay. This is, this is, uhm, an interview with a, ah, somebody who was interviewing people for jobs, has a, has a small business in the urban community. And they asked about, you know, whether this person discriminates, and he says definitely. I don't, I know I've seen it over a period of thirty years. I have it right in here. Basically, the Oriental is much more aggressive and intelligent and studious than the Hispanic. The Hispanics, except the Cubans of course, they have the worth, ah, the work ethnic. Ah, you mentioned the case of native-born blacks, the interviewer says, and the respondent says they're the laziest bunch, laziest of the bunch. Interviewer, that would relate to your earlier remarks about dependability. What is the reason for that? Respondent, the parents are that way so, what the hell, they didn't have a role model to copy, that's part of it. So that's part of the racism that people experience, that's just one glimpse of it. Okay. Uhm, I wanna devote the next ten minutes to just some comments about practice and public policy then we'll open up the, ah, floor for questions. Always fond of a weird metaphor, we're gonna open up the floor here like, we'll open up, all right. Sometimes I think too much about idioms. Okay. Uhm, so the question that's often been raised as I've given this talk over the last few years and I think about this issue of work is, âAll right David, you got some good ideas here, you know. This is nice. You play some good music in your talks." What about practice, what about public policy? You know, show us what we can do. And I, I've thought about this 'coz the two, three chapters out of the ten chapters of my book are devoted to practice and public policy and the practice chapters, I, I, are very detailed and I did have a lot of thoughts about this. So my, my thinking was that, in some ways we have a lot of knowledge about how to intervene psychologically in the work lives of the poor and working class and the folks of color who are experiencing oppression. The ideas that I, I've come up with are really based on the literatures that we have on what we call the âmarginalized population realm.â If you put all those marginalized populations, you really have the model person, because in many ways, the white male middle class person is not the model person in, in our society. You put all the people together, people of color, you know, women, people with dis, disabling conditions, the unemployed, this is the vast majority of people. So you, know, this career development field really is a psychology of a minority group. The minority group being, you know, and statistically the minority group being the, the affluent European Americans. So we do have a literature here and what I'm, what I have done is I've called through that literature and I've come up with some of the major, uhm, findings from various scholars, many of whom sit in this room now who've written really eloquently about this. 

00:58:10
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN So one of the lessons we have are lessons for at-risk youth. And, uhm, so I, I've actually done some of this work along with others and we've looked it to the predictors of an adaptive school-to-work transition for the non-college bound. That's a very at-risk group. And there were four major factors that we came up within this big(ph) literature review we did a few years ago. One is clear competencies in basic academic skills, very strong predictor. Another one is self-initiated motivation, flexibility and planfulness. Another major group of factors are accessible relational supports, and the third is an educational environment that offers rigorous connection to work-based learning and that emphasizes school and work-linkages which by the way is now, ah, you can't mention school to work in the current political climate right now. I've been scolded by the Department of Education for bringing that up and say we associate that with the previous administration. I said I do too. 

00:59:05
Active and engaged counseling is needed to help overcome barriers to employment. Counselors are often used at the work site to enhance adjustment to a job. 

00:59:05
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN All right. I didn't get the grant(ph) but, ah, yeah, you can't, you can't, ah, you can't, ah, something says your called in. Uhm, okay, lessons from the, for the, from the disabled community. There's a very rich literature, by the way, on work and disability. And one of the things we've made a mistake in career development and counseling psych is to marginalize this to rehab, rehab counseling. It's a huge mistake. This tremendous knowledge that our rehab counseling colleagues have developed that is incredibly useful to us and I feel very privileged to have read a lot of this work. Uhm, so if you look at books like Edna Szymanski's book, Work and Disability, you find a number of factors here that seem to really help with getting folks with disabling conditions into the workforce, into meaningful jobs. One is active and engaged counseling. In other words, the kind of counseling that folk, rehab counselors do is not often sit in the room and wait for the client to come to them. They often go the worksite and work with other employees. If you go to the supermarket and you see folks with developmental disabilities bagging your groceries, you could be assured that somebody from that agency has gone down to that supermarket and done training for the rest of the staff there, which is a psychoeducational intervention in of itself. Uhm, job clubs are used to help clients obtain work, and this is very important about the, in, the disabled community as clients are politically engaged in public policy. The Americans for Disabilities Act wouldn't be here without folks with, ah, disabling conditions. That's a great example of advocacy work at its best. Okay, lessons from people of color in the US. Actually, I got this from two people in this room and I give them great credit, Robert and Janet. Their work has influenced me a lot. Uhm, tsk, so, work is a part of a broader system in which opportunities and resources are allocated in ineq, in inequitable ways. Ah, and in order to overcome the barriers, clients need to be aware of the broader context and understand the way in which racism is manifested in, in education and work. So there's a strong, uhm, social and political consciousness in this work, the work of vocational psychologists and counseling psychologists who focus on race and racism. Okay? And I'm going through this quickly. So if you're interested, my book will be out in the early winter and it's coming out on paperback and hard cover so, ah, you'll be able to get it inexpensively I hope. Uhm, actually, it will be inex, actually that's, the, the, this publisher I use is very inexpensive. Okay, lessons from women and the feminist movement. One of the things we've learned here is that the personal is political. Ah, we've also learned that work settings replicate the social world with the a priori notions of women's roles, typically as nurturers of having secondary roles in the world of work. And sexism is still a major struggle that is manifested by the following, the glass ceiling and sexual harassment. Here again, many counseling psychologists have led the way on this issue as well. Lessons from the Multicultural Movement. Uhm, the meaning of life experience is shaped to a great extent by our cultural context. Uhm, not all cultures value work and career in similar ways. Uhm, we also learned that it's critical to explore how clients construct meaning about the issues that they present. And this is critical, uhm, that it's, we need to no longer rely on Western notions of work and career. We need to open up to conceptions from other cultures that may not value the autonomy and individual satisfaction model that we have obtain, that we have developed here. And I'm guilty of that in my own work. I have that biased. I've written about it in my book that I have that value of achievement and life satisfaction through work, and it's part of being raised in this Western culture. Uhm, I'm trying to deal with it now. I'm trying to become less of a workaholic. Okay, lessons from the unemployed. Uhm, one of the things we know here is that lack of work is associated with the individual mental health struggles and with broader social problems. To quote Dylan here, "You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows." When people don't have work, they're not doing so well. And I think as psychologists and as counselors and as social scientists, we need to make this case and make it strongly. As a society, we have grown to accept unemployment. So as Western Europe, by the way, and in some ways, they're even worse than we are about it, because they have developed in leisure activities for the unemployed. And my view is I think we should develop work. I, I, I know I get in trouble when I go to Europe and give this talk coz they think that I'm like a right- winger -when I say that we should work. But, uhm, I don't think we should just send people off, you know, to play Bingo. There's a lot of work that needs to be done in the world, you know, education, schools, taking care of the elderly. There's more than enough things to be done here and not everything is done by automation. Uhm, also, we know that many unemployed workers are struggling to obtain skills that will enhance their employability. So we know that there's a great deal of work that needs to be done in providing more training for people. Uhm, the huge problem in our country with that is the tremendous lack of an investment in training and development here, especially since 2001. But even before that, uhm, we haven't seen good training initiatives in the US since the Johnson Administration, in my view. Uhm, because again, we've grown to accept unemployment, and I've joked with my friends and colleagues that I've come out in favor of full employment in my book, which is, it's not a provocative idea but, you know, people don't talk about that anymore. You know, we need full employment. That was I think from the '60s but I think we need to provide full employment. Okay. Also, we know that active, agentic, and assertive methods are needed to locate work. So, uhm, one of the questions. 

01:04:55
General Practice Considerations 

01:04:55
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN That people have raised is how can vocational counseling or psychotherapy help people plan when the world of wok, world of work is in such a state of flux. I was combining work with flux, wux. So one of the, one of the first questions I'll ask you, those of you who are therapists, is what sort of reactions and attitudes do you bring into your counseling sessions that may affect how you view work. 

01:05:20
â¢What is the role of exploration, planning, and decision-making in contemporary practice, particularly in light of the instability in our work lives? âIs it still adaptive to be as planful as Super suggested nearly 50 years ago? 

01:05:20
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN Uhm, one of the things I've argued in my book is that we have countertransference feelings about work, that you have, as a therapist, you can have envy. You can have, uhm, you can have, feel some distaste when you hear about certain people's work lives, that we've never really dealt with this issue of countertransference around work and around power and, and social status. Uhm, another question that I've raised is what is the role of exploration, planning, and decision-making, and I'm not gonna answer all these 'coz these are just kind of thought questions. Uhm, and another question that we need to think about, is it still adaptive to be as planful as Super suggested- 

01:06:05
Affirming Culture and Race in Practice â¢Infuse multicultural counseling competencies into practice. â¢Explore sources of countertransference about working, wealth, power, and authority. â¢Infuse a contextual approach into one's work. "There is a whole lot more that put this gun in my hand." 

01:06:05
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN Nearly 50 years ago? So let me talk a little bit about some of my recommendations. These are actually, I, I thought a lot about this, these are special slides I made up just for this talk, just so Janet will know I did do a lot of extra work on this. Uhm, I did actually. I've rev, I've revised a lot of my thinking but these, these are brand new ideas here. They're not so new but I just got them together. One is I think we need to infuse multicultural counseling competencies into our practices and particularly into practices around working career, that if we do that, if we really do that well, that we will begin to think outside the box about work issues and we'll begin to really push ourselves to incorporate our thinking about work in a creative way. They will no longer tolerate the avoidance of work in session or treat it like a secondary or tertiary issue. One of the things I've seen in the clinical literature is discussions of work as, uhm, as symbolic of other intrapsychic pro, uh, projections of intrapsychic issues. And that's a very rich literature. I've, I've written some of it myself, you know, these family drama models that you'd manifest your unresolved family trauma in your workplace. But I think when we do that, we denigrate the actual content of what a client tells us. I think we need to take it a face value at the initials, and I think when we don't take work-related issues and we try to convert them into intrapsychic or family issues, then we're denigrating the real life struggles that people have, okay? I think that would be a secondary hypothesis after really hearing about how abusive a supervisor really is. You don't just think, you know, thinking about this person's reflection of their abusive father, that could be, but the person could be an SOB as well. And, you know, the clinical literature forces us away from the real world, rea, from the reality of what a patient presents. So as I say here, we need to explore sources of countertransference about working, about wealth, about power, and about authority. And we need to infuse a contextual approach into our work. And, uhm, I know Janet was probably waiting for me to quote Bruce Springsteen and I'm gonna do it now. Uhm, there's a great line in a song written about 25 years ago called "Nebraska." It was a beautiful album, uhm, very sad record. And what it, in two of the so, two of the songs on this album, the character begs to be executed, the character who has just committed violence. And then one of, one of them, the guy loses his job in an auto plant and just goes on a rampage. And the other one, it's about, this, this killer in Nebraska and I kind of forgot the, the whole story. But when the guy gets to the judge, he says, "There's a whole lot more than this to put that gun in my hand." And what that is really saying is that, "Yeah, you can put me to death. But look at what my life has been like before, you know, look at what I've been through. Just look at the context of what I've been through. Do it man. Just do it. Get it over with but just look at where I've been, like tell the whole story." And, uhm, that's what I think we could do in terms of affirming culture and race in practice about work. Ah, public policy implications, uhm, uhm, I'll, I'll go quickly through this. 

01:09:05
Public Policy Implications: Educational Reform âEnhance the STW: Help students internalize the connections between school and work. âProvide greater equity in school systems âReduce racism and the chilly climate in classrooms 

01:09:05
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN  Because I have, all this is, is in my book. Uhm, and first, I think we need to enhance the school-to-work transition. Uhm, the fact that the Bush administration totally negated school to work initiatives, starting in 2001, to me is really outrageous. It was Saba Ali, my friend from the University of Iowa, has done this work as well. This, these were great initiatives. They were, you know, they were problems with them but this was a great idea. Help kids learn about the connection between school and a work so they'll be more motivated. That's a common sense idea and, you know, we need to get back to it. Uhm, we need to provide greater equity in school systems. This is a no-brainer. I know that Jonathan Kozol just wrote a book about, I forgot the title. It would be cool if I remember the title. Does anybody remember the title? Apart. 

01:09:50
MARQUEY  The Shame of America: The New Educational Apartheid. 

01:09:55
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN Thank you Marquey(ph). "The Shame of the America: The New Educational Apartheid." That's, that's a must read book. The, the, the shame of America is the Boston Public Schools. And the school where my daughter went was Lexington High School. It's day and night, they could be in different countries. And I, you know, I would, I sent my daughter to the good school, I mean, I know I did that. But I did a lot of work in the Boston Public Schools, to reduce my own guilt. But, ah, and to have a good positive impact on the Boston Public Schools, and I was trying to do more. Uhm, we need to provide greater equity in school systems. Tim Weiss talked about that this morning. It's critical. We need to reduce racism in the chilly climate in classrooms. Is Miriam here? Miriam Jernegan? She, I've stolen that idea from you. You got the idea from Janet Helms so, we're using the chilly climate idea now. Ah, we need to look at training and post-secondary education. 

01:10:45
Training and Post-Secondary Education âEnhance community college infrastructure and investments âProvide training and post-secondary education in a manner that is constructed in conjunction with the prevailing cultural framework of a given community is critical. 

01:10:45
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN We need to enhance community college infrastructure and investments. We have a really great infrastructure for community colleges in the US. It's a great resource but completely underfunded. The community college can provide a great vehicle for retooling and retraining throughout the life span. And I think it's a, you know, a huge issue. Community colleges especially in this state, and I come from New York where the community colleges were a lot better, Robert may not believe it but you should see the ones here in Massachusetts, they're unbelievable. The library is, your library in your office is bigger than the library in many of these community colleges. It's, it's frightening how poorly staffed and resourced they are. It's really outrageous. And that would be a vehicle to do so much for communities and for poor and working class folks to get them in, to get their skills up to the point where they can get jobs. Uhm, we need to provide, uhm, training and education in a manner that is consistent with the cultural beliefs of the populations we work with. We can't always go in with the European-American view of, "Come to this school. Come here at, you know, 3 o'clock in the afternoon. We don't want your kids here." You know, that's gonna be a complete turn off and it will continue to, you know, uhm, to recapitulate the oppression and the denigration that's taking place. Unemployment policy. The research I've read about the changing world of work indicates that chronic and episodic unemployment will co, will probably grow. 

01:12:10
Unemployment Policy âChronic and episodic unemployment will likely grow, with people of color being particularly vulnerable. âThe psychological study of unemployment and underemployment may help to identify some meaningful ways for counselors, therapists, and others in one's life to help people who have little or no opportunity to obtain work. âAdvocate for full employmentââwork with dignity 

01:12:10
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN Uhm, it will grow due to automation and to globalization, and there's nothing we could do about it. I know that people like to demonstrate against globalization and throw rocks at Starbucks. I just hope I'm not in it when they throw the rock. But, ah, unfortunately, we can't stop that. That's a phenomenon that Friedman writes about, Tom Friedman writes about. And to look at it bluntly, it's the victory of free market capitalism. And the leftist in me doesn't like that very much but, I mean, come on, Soviet Union broke up. I mean, I, I still can't believe it myself. I grew up in that era, I still can't believe the Soviet Union broke up. Am I the only one who can't believe it? It's a shock to me. This whole, you know, the shock that China has got this whole entrepreneurial coast, and the inside of China is communist still. It's, it's, it's like weird. But globalization is here and, uhm, we have to deal with it, we have to, we have to contend with it. I do believe that we need to really deal with this issue of what's gonna happen when work begins to disappear? There's a number of books written in the '90s about this Jeremy Rifkin's book, The End of Work. There's some, there's some prognostic indications that suggest that there's gonna be less and less work for people with fewer skills, and we need to deal with this now. A good politician would come out and say this is a huge crisis facing our country, that and global warming by the way. It's the warmest October I've ever been through in my life, man. Whoever said Oc, it wasn't global warming wasn't living here. Uhm, we need to advocate for full employment and work with dignity, not just any kind of work but work with dignity and work that's gonna be, ah, if not meaningful, just dignified work. Mental health issues and work. We need to conduct research on the mental health consequences of lack of work and of denigrating- 

01:13:55
Mental Health Issues and Working â¢Conduct research on mental health consequences of lack of work and denigrating work. â¢Develop policies to promote culturally affirming workplaces. 

01:13:55
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN -work. This needs to be put back into the policy plate of the NIMH which funded studies 30 and 40 years ago on im, impact of unemployment. We need to do these studies again. And I'm open to getting those grants. Ah, we need to develop policies that promote culturally affirming workplaces. 

01:14:15
Social and Interpersonal Oppression at Work â¢Individuals are often exposed to very painful interactions wherein racism, sexism, heterosexism, and other forms of social oppression are expressed both explicitly and implicitly. â¢Explore the nature of bullying and the influence of social oppression in bullying at work. 

01:14:15
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN And there's also an emerging literature on social and interpersonal oppression at work. There's a large literature now on bullying at work. So it's like those bullies who'd picked on me on high school have now gone to work. But they're not finding me there, they're finding someone else. But, ah, I was very good at avoiding them. Uhm, I would always make them laugh, that was my thing. I said, "You're gonna beat me up? You could beat up a much tougher guy than me." And I never got beat up. Uhm, individuals who are exposed to very painful interactions where racism, sexism, heterosexism, and other forms of social oppression are expressed both explicitly and implicitly, and we do need to explore the nature of bullying at work and the degree to which, to which it's linked to social oppression. 

01:14:55
Greater Cultural Knowledge with Respect to Working â¢Provide workers with diversity training, which is both morally imperative and economically wise. â¢Explore the impact of culture in therapy, research, and public policy recommendations. 

01:14:55
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN  And we need to develop greater cultural knowledge with respect to working. Uhm, I clearly have a Western view of work although it's, it's evolving. But I'm, I'm rooted in the West. And we need to incorporate and include other cultural perspectives here. So, uhm,- 

01:15:15
Concluding Comments and Questions â¢The future of working and race/culture raises important questions: âHow can we create social structures that will promote greater equity in education, housing, health care, and training to ensure an equal playing field? âHow can we begin conversations or difficult dialogues about the impact of racism in all aspects of work life? 

01:15:15
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN Just some final questions and I'll take some questions from the audience. Uhm, how can we generate social structures that will promote greater equity in education, housing, heath care, and training to ensure an equal playing field? I have the answers but I, I'll, that's in my next talk. I have some answers or some suggestions. It used to have to do with people giving up privilege so they don't wanna hear about that. Ah, how can we begin conversations or difficult dialogues about the impact of racism in all aspects of work life? 

01:15:45
Concluding Comments and Discussion â¢To what extent can psychologists and other mental health professionals expand their scope of attention beyond intrapsychic of cognitive dimensions to embrace the context, including working? â¢How can we maintain the "figure" of the poor and working classes, despite the lack of financial incentives to do so? 

01:15:45
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN And to what extent can psychologists and other mental health professionals expand their scope of attention beyond intrapsychic, this should be "or" cognitive dimensions to embrace the context, including work? And how can we maintain the "figure" of the poor and working classes, despite the lack of financial incentives to do so? So let me, uhm, open up the floor for questions or comments. Chris has, oh thank you. 

01:16:15
[sil.] 

01:16:15
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN  He has a question back here. 

01:16:20
UNKNOWN  I had the benefit of being, ah, Labor Studies Major at St. Joseph's University, so this is very relevant. Uhm, I'm looking at a sociologist's point of view more so than a psychologist's point of view. And what I wonder is, in your opinion, the, ah, the practicality of all this. I, I call it kind of the cocktail party thing where it sounds great and it's, it's really interesting at a cocktail party. But unless there's that justice-driven, ah, almost entire change of culture like you're, you're suggesting, I mean, workers are on a supply and demand curve and they're part of a bottom line. So I wonder, in your opinion, how, would you really see this happening? With all your recommendations, do you really see this, ah, in the next, say next 30 years in, in the United States? 

01:17:05
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN That's a great question. Do I see it's happening in the next 30 years? That's a great question. Uhm, yeah, I mean, the reality is I'm one person and psychologists are one group of professionals and counsels one group of professionals out of a large array of people who are interested in this issue. I think that as, what we can do is to try, try to provide a unique contribution to the discourse in this area. And there are number of ways of doing that. I, ah, one of things I think we need to move forward on is how to move our work into public policy. I'm the current chair of the Society for Vocational Psychology and we've just been asked, all the societies within the Division of Counseling Psychology to write a position paper on some aspects of what we do in relation to the Hurricane Katrina victims. Now, Hurricane Katrina was a de, devastating, ah, event. But you know, and I think Tim Weiss made a good point like it just opened up people's eyes to poverty and racism. It seems kind of crazy that they didn't know about it before but it, it does give us an opportunity to do something that may be policy people at APA would then present in Washington, and we would then document in this thing, in this position paper, very brief paper on here's what the research says about not working. Here's what the research that says about getting back to work, here's what the government can do in terms of providing some infrastructure investments. So do I see this happening, like hugely? And look, I'm, ah, I've been around the block, you know? I'm, I'm not so young. And yeah, I've seen a lot of things happened like, that haven't been so great. So I don't know but, uhm, you know, I don't think we could stop trying. So, I, I don't, I do think, I will say this, I think that we can make these changes in the field of counseling and psychology that, you know, people like Janet Helms have changed the field of Counseling Psychology with her work on racial identity and Robert Carter has done this. So I'm gonna try to do the same thing in the career development field and, you know, uhm, if they can do it I can do it. I mean, I, I, I feel like I'm their peer so, uhm, I, uhm, try, I'm gonna try. I'll go down trying. Yes? 

01:19:05
UNKNOWN I wanted to ask a question in terms of cultural competency. When I was in graduate school, the word "cultural competency" always brought up negativity from some of my colleagues and also my professors. And when you think of that term, it literally means to be competent in a culture. And what you talked about in terms of therapists being culturally competent and then workers with their patients, how do you get that across to say that just because I work with African-Americans that I'm automatically skilled at being a culturally competent therapist? I think that's something that we need to really look at, and when Sue and Sue or Sue and Pomerado(ph), and I know that Dr. Helms and Dr. Carter could correct me, ah, put out the guidelines for being a multiculturally competent therapist, how do you say to people that it's very important to be competent in a culture? Just because you work with them doesn't mean that you know it. And that's even for African-Americans. People of color who are therapists need to be culturally competent. I just wanna know if you could address that, Dr. Blustein. 

01:20:00
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN That's a great question. Uhm, ah, I don't know how to, how to, how to explain it to colleagues who don't wanna hear it. I've been trying that. My colleagues will know I've been trying that, sometimes successfully, sometimes not so successfully. I'll just tell you what I've done. My first counseling job was at a college in Westchester County, ah, working with, ah, I was in the HEOP program, Higher Education Opportunity Program with primarily African-American students from New York, ah, Mount Vernon, and Yonkers. And I was the only European-American counselor. It was 1977. I was, ah, kind of young and naive guy. Uhm, and what I did is I moved into the culture. I moved in as much as I could. I, I, I owned who I was and, uhm, I just, I just embedded myself in the urban community. I didn't move into the urban community but I learned as much as I could about it. And, uhm, I was respectful about what I didn't know and open to what I could learn. And to be respectful, I think it's something that's hard to do in some ways. Part of it I think comes from how you're raised, and I give my parents great credit for this, for raising me in a way that, uhm, to afford all people dignity. And, ah, I again give homage to them. They didn't have all the right words for what they did but they did teach me that lesson. And somehow, I, I internalized it. I'm not done with that process yet. You know, it's always a, uhm, a pro, a process. But in terms of working with other, other academics and other leaders in the field, I will say that counseling psychology as a, as a specialty has been very successful in helping European-American psychologists to, to, to grow in this area. I wouldn't say that we've been universally successful but we've been more successful than I think many of us thought we would've been. But we have a long way to go, a very long way to go. So I don't have the whole answer, Dawn, but it's good to see you again. Dawn was one of my students and soon you'll be a master student there and it was great to see you. And there's a question from Girda(ph), May, Chris or Brenda? 

01:21:55
GIRDA Thank you, thank you very much for a really wonderful talk. I really enjoyed it. I wanted to, uhm, ask your thoughts about how you think these concepts that you are developing fit in with sort of like that first vignette where you talked about the immigrant Asian woman in terms of identity, if we go to work where most immigrants might sort of feel their sense of identity relating to the work that they do and what happens to them when they come to, in your country where they no longer have this identity. And so, I need to hear your thoughts in terms of how your new frame of understanding to psychology work fits in for immigrant... (crosstalk) 

01:22:25
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN  That's a great question... (crosstalk) 

01:22:30
GIRDA ...populations. 

01:22:30
DR. DAVID BLUSTEIN Girda(ph), coz actually I thought of it a lot yesterday when your students presented on the day that you have the date on the Haitian immigrants, and they mentioned that there was an immigrant. I'm gonna tell you my own personal reaction to this vignette. They presented a mi, ah, I think it was a, I don't know if it's a man or a woman who came here who was a doctor in Haiti and was now working as a mental health technician. And my first thought was, "I wouldn't leave Haiti, man. I'd go back and be a doctor in Haiti." Ah, it's my countertransference reaction, like I wouldn't give up that status and that great job to be a mental health technician and I'm, I'm exposing some of myself here with saying that. Uhm, but obviously, this person had a reason for doing it and my, I think that, that's a huge problem. I mean, it's a problem that is more pronounced now than it was in the immigration wave of a hundred years ago, uhm, because when my ancestors came here a hundred years ago, they were as poor as, as church mice. They didn't have any education as, they were happy to do anything but we're getting high, more highly educated immigrants with a wider array of skills and training. So I don't really have an easy answer. The loss of identity is huge and it's an issue that needs to be dealt with in counseling and therapy. And I think, you know, the other thing is to help them develop their work lives again. Get back, you know, figure out how they get retrained and retooled. I mean, if I were working with that individual, I might say, "Well, let's think about other things you could do like nurse practitioner or physician's assistant to get back into a role that's like what you did." Uhm, you know, you, there, I, I would use the kind of old fashioned career development model, a person-environment fit. What's the person's interest, how, what are there, what are they valuing right now? You gotta do a full kind of assessment and see what kind of options they have. But it's a very difficult question and it's a huge problem that immigrants are facing. And it's also very humbling for us to know that people would give up their, these careers to come to the States and, you know, and, and, and what poverty can do. It's, it's really humbling. So thank you all. It was a great, I really enjoyed this and, ah, I hope, if you have any questions, see me afterwards. I'll be at the reception this evening as well. So thank you.
