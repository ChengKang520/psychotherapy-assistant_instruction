CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Hello, and welcome. I am Dr. Cyrus Marcellus Ellis, a tenure professor here at Governor State University in the Counseling Education of Supervision Faculty. I've been at this university for 15 years. I'm also and alum of University of Virginia and the Curry School of Education. Not to mention, I'm a vet of the United States Army for 20 years. So I welcome you to this topic and this coursework on the Psychopharmacology of Depression. Welcome. What we are here to discuss today is the pharmacology of depression. And one thing that we start to understand this topic is to recognize that depression is an illness. It is not just being sad from time to time, it is in fact an illness. Before we engage in the Psychopharmacology of depression, let's first take a moment to understand Psychopharmacology. We're talking about two primary things. One, the way in which our minds and our bodies are attuned to understand an illness like depression, how we approach it. Second, all the medicines and all the different ways our body works with this thing called depression. To understand that, we focus on what we call, how our brain operates. And that really is a, a bunch of neural-networks in our brain that send messages from one neuron to the other, just like a highway. You send messages down, they are received and then they go further down to tell the body what to do. And it's quite important we understand depression because depression is what we call a system dysregulation type disorder. In global terms, like psychological terms, it's a mood disorder. And that means our mood is not regulated. So that is the dysregulation. Our mood gets not stable over time, over a period of time. Now when we talk about depression, we're talking about signs and symptoms, if you will. And what we want to understand that depression is not I'm upset. In the clinical world, such as psychologists, professional counselors use, being upset is not depression. Sometimes our clients come in and say I'm depressed, when they really mean, over the last week or so, I've been upset. When you talk about true depression or what some people say, clinical depression, we're talking about the fact you have been sad and you remain sad over a two week or more period of time, more sad than now. The activities that you used to find pleasurable are no longer pleasurable to you. You find yourself withdrawing significant, significantly from others. You know, we all had that period of time where, I don't want to be bothered today by anybody, I shut my phone off and I just sit, have a good cry or watch an old movie. That's not the withdrawal I'm talking about right now. We're talking about significant withdrawal from others over a period of time. We're also talking about major changes in the way you eat. You can go from eating everything you see, or not eating anything at all. So we call that app… appetite changes. Irritation can grow, where things that used to shake off, in terms of it bothers you but you're able to cope with it, now everything and everyone causes you great irritation. Not to mention, the way you approach people, your attitude toward people can drastically change. That's what we're talking about when we're really talking about clinical depression. That requires some degree of treatment. Now depending on who you are and where you are, how we address that, can be quite different. But for this block of instruction, we're talking about doing Psychopharmacology with depression. So now we talk about the organicity of your brain and how particular medications go to aid in addressing depression. Obviously, we're looking at this from an organic perspective, not one where it's a spiritual base, not one where it is a, uh, religious understanding. We're talking about how the body works. So let's have that conversation about how the body works. In our brain, these neural pathways I spoke about a moment ago, what tends to happen when things are working as they ought to? Is that, you have enough, of what we call neurotransmitters, at your disposal sending these messages. You may recall that we talked about neurotransmitters and that our brains produce them and send them along. And when you have the right amount of neurotransmitters in the brain, Dopamine, Serotonin and things of that nature, those communicate they are happy. And we like to be happy. So those are two of the happy neurotransmitters that get sent from one neuron to the next. When you have depression, well, we have a slight issue. When the brain works normally, you release a certain amount of these neurotransmitters. And the next neuron picks up those neurotransmitters in good supply, so that, that message can be sent throughout the rest of the brain and throughout the rest of the body. When depression is something that we struggle with, we tend to have not enough neurotransmitters to be released in our brain, so that not enough are picked up and the message does not carry out. Think about when we were younger and passing notes in school, uh, before recess. And you want to let everybody know we're going to play kickball by the big tree. And you have certain people passing notes. But somehow the teacher intercepts those notes. Only certain kids get the word that we're gonna be by the tree to play kickball. So when recess happens, not everybody is there. Same thing, kind of, event in the brain. You have neurotransmitters that go out, they are not all picked up so everybody in the body, so to speak, does not get the word on what we ought to be doing, how we ought to be reacting. And that's really where we focus our attention when we talk about the pharmacology of depression. Because there's a little something that occurs in the body that really makes the intervention with medicine quite important. And that is this, when the neurotransmitters are released in that little small space we call the synaptic cleft, it has to cross "like a valley" before it's picked up on the other side. When you have enough, it usually gets across. There's a function of what we call the presynaptic neuron, that's the one that's letting it go. It actually vacuums up neurotransmitters you don't need. If they don't connect to what we call the postsynaptic neuron then it just floats around. Well, no need to have it just float out there, this neuron will vacuum it up and later have it destroyed because more are always coming. Well, if you're depressed, you don't have enough where it being vacuumed back up helps you. You need to release a certain amount, so the information can go and in the depressed brain not enough is released. So the ones that do get connected sends some sort of a message but the ones that don't get vacuumed up and they get destroyed later. That is how we have clinical depression. A lack of neurotransmitter transmission and then the signs and symptoms of why you aren't as happy as you could be, why you are withdrawn from others, why you don't have interest in certain things, why you lack focus and lack the ability to concentrate, all come from the lack of those neurotransmitters going from point A to point B. Now we have the outward signs and symptoms and with a blood test we can see the internal dimensions of why that is. So we now need medication to come in to this process so that we can aid in neurotransmission. How do we get enough neuron transmitters to be communicated from the presynaptic neuron to the postsynaptic neuron? And the action that we're looking for is how do we stop… that, that vacuuming up of the neurotransmitters that we need to go forward, that currently aren't going forward. In other scientific terms we call that vacuuming re-uptake. How do we stop the re-uptake of those particular neurotransmitters from being reabsorbed by the presynaptic and get them to be absorbed by the postsynaptic? That's why we have particular medications to do that. One of them is called a class. There's always a class of something. We have classes of cars, we have classes of trucks. And if you in a university, you have particular classes of classes for particular disciplines that lead to particular degrees, so those classes of medications. And these medications have particular actions that make them work. One, that we use a great deal and that we see on TV advertised a great deal, are what we call SSR or Is, Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors. That last word, inhibitor, is the action that we're looking for. What can we do to inhibit that vacuuming action from the presynaptic neuron so that we have enough neurotransmitter is in that synaptic cleft, so that the postsynaptic neuron has a chance for those to attach and send more of a complete message. The SSRIs as we call them, are typically your Paxil, Zoloft type medications. There are some newer ones out there, but those medications advertise themselves to be the inhibitory action. When you consume those medications, as you are supposed to consume them, mind you, you have in the bloodstream, in the synaptic cleft, this inhibitory action. So that presynaptic neuron will release its serotonin as one example, maybe you need 12, but you only release six, by example. When you are taking the SSRIs, it acts as an inhibitor. What does that mean? It's going to attach itself to the presynaptic neuron so that when the vacuuming action ought to occur in those little pebbles of serotonin are looking to come back, there's no place to go, which means it stays within the synaptic cleft. That gives the postsynaptic neuron an opportunity to have it attached and send the message down the line. That's one class of pharmacological intervention, the SSRIs. We also have one call the SNRI, another neurotransmitter linked to the condition known as depression is norepinephrine. So we have another class of drug call the selective norepinephrine re-uptake Inhibitor. It works in the same way as the SSRI works. To inhibit that particular neurotransmitter from being reabsorbed or the re-uptake action of the presynaptic neuron so that more of that neurotransmitter remains in the synaptic cleft, so that the postsynaptic neuron can absorb that and go down the line and give a more complete message. So there's a certain… there's a great class of drug that addresses that particular action. When those are working fine, you start to see what we call a remediation or cessation of those symptoms we talked about, regarding sadness over a period of time, the withdrawal pieces, the lack of interest becomes now interested again. The social withdrawal begins to cease and people are more active. The irritability tends to lessen when the medication is being used. Now any time, yeah, pharmacology in play, you have to be concerned with the main dimension of pharmacology which is not only how the medication is made, all the scientific stuff and all that great chemistry stuff, and it's primary use i.e. to treat depression, you have to concern yourself with what we call the side effects. Any course on the pharmacology of depression requires a discussion with the issue of side effects. So let's talk about a few of those. One primary side effect of using any class of anti-depressant medication, whether it's the SSRIs or the SNRIs is the issue of how fast do we see a cessation of symptoms when first ingesting the vindication. As a, what I like to say is a cautionary statement when you start taking medication for depression, is the issue that symptoms do not seem to cease upon the initial ingestion of that medication. In fact, data holds that it might take some 15 to 20 days to begin to see a cessation of symptoms, i.e. the withdrawal, the sadness, the appetite changes in the like, even sleep disturbances for that matter. That may not change overnight. That's important for clients who take them because usually they're at a point where they want to take the meds because they want the symptoms to go away. But they have to be reminded that it might take 15 to 20 days for those symptoms to abate or cease. And in that window of 15 to 20 days, we have another caution and that is symptoms can become worse, which doesn't seem to fit our understanding of you take medicine to get better but if I take this medication, I seem to be getting worse. That's a side effect that we have to be conscious of. In that 15 to 20 day window, the symptoms can get worse and some can show up that weren't there at the beginning of the ingestion of the medication. And one of the main ones we're most concerned about is the issue of suicide. Suicide ideation can grow and become more dangerous in the initial work up of these medications. So that's a side effect we have to be careful about. The others aren't as drastic as suicide ideation but equally important to view and understand. 

00:17:35
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS And they're what we call the Autonomic Nervous System pieces and some of the other body system pieces dealing with issues of dry mouth. For some, your mouth can become increasingly dry. Which means you're gonna increase your fluid intake, which for some they don't choose water as much as they choose soda-pop. So it would not be unheard of to add particular weight gain because you're drinking more carbonated and sugar based drinks to quench your thirst. There's the issue of your body's libido. Now that's not a freudian sexual thing as most people might go to, as in terms of the energy issue. While you might regain some energy from being lethargic as a symptom of clinical depression, you might not have yet the energy you have as a spry teenager. So you will have energy differences when you start taking this medication. We've already talked about weight gain from drinking soda-pop or other beverages but you can also have weight gain from fluid collecting in tissues. And other issues like headaches or sensitivity to light and sometimes salt is different in the body. So these side effects are important to know on the pharmacology side because of this overriding issue that we have in this arena which is compliance. One of the biggest side effects of taking medication beyond the physical body is will the clients become compliant. Meaning, will they take them as prescribed? Big issue of side effect because of the notion that what they experienced, dry mouth or maybe a little shaky and a little bit of a uneasy feeling is so distasteful to their mental state that they stop taking the pills either completely or they take it intermittently. And intermittent is also a bit scary, in terms of the treatment compliance, because medications have a moment where they have to have what we call a build up period. Missing dosage does not allow the medication to occupy the bloodstream as necessary. When that's not up to par, that inhibitory action we talked about earlier is put at risk because they're not, not enough of the medication exists in the bloodstream for the inhibitory action to be sustained. Now we have a return of what we call the negative symptoms of depression. So now the, the patient is uneasy and uneven in their approach to their, their mental health disorder, therefore, they are confused about what's going on. And as a clinician, we wonder and worry about what's going on as well. So the re-application of how are you taking the medication, are you taking a compliant? What are the side effects doing for you, is the larger picture of the Psychopharmacology of depression. So we understand the psychology of it, how the client approaches medication, how they understand depression, we understand depression as a clinical disorder and disorder of the brain. And now we understand the classes of drugs that we take so that an individual has a chance to come back to a what we call a homeostatic state i.e. a regulated body system and then the next step and the last step of pharmacology goes in to play, how well does the client themselves begin to do the things necessary so that they can now regulate their total body system with medication for an ultimate quality of life that allows them to live as free and as open as they need to. Put all those things together, beginning with the recognition that depression is an illness, it is not just a matter of sometimes I'm sad and sometimes I'm not. You have a full understanding of the Psychopharmacology at a basic level, uh, for depression. With that, we recognize some 18 million Americans have this particular disorder, some are being treated, some are not. We now have a basic way to point them in the right direction for the ability to get a handle on this, cope with it, address it and live a good quality of life. Thank you very much for your attention. Are there any questions? 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN I have a question. 

00:22:40
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Yes. 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN How do you know if the clients are lacking neurotransmitters? 

00:22:45
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Very good question. One of the things that we do in our profession, we no longer, just on our own, we have a thing called a criterion based assessment. And part of that criterion based assessment involves not only the Q & A about how you have been feeling, we also take a medical history and if we're at a very good place that medical history involves a visit to our medical colleagues, who will do blood tests. 

00:23:15
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS And in the blood test is where we discover that dimension of your body, in terms of your body systems. The blood test can reveal presence of a lot of things not to mention whether or not your brain is operating at the level that ought to be. And from that examination, coupled with other pieces of your history, we make a determination on whether or not a review and/or assessment by a medical professional will be necessary because that's the individual obviously would have a prescribed medication.
