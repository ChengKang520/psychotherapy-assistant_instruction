Colleen R. Logan 

00:00:10
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Good afternoon. Welcome to our program today, 'Working Effectively and Affirmatively with Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Youth'. I'm Dr. Colleen Logan. I'm the program coordinator at Walden University. I'm, I'm the coordinator of the Marriage, Couple and Family Counseling program and I'm really excited to work with you today. 

00:00:25
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:00:25
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON And I'm Dr. Tiffany Rush-Wilson and I also work at Walden University, where I am the clinical skills coordinator for the counseling programs and I also work in private practice, a very small practice at this point, um, because I have so much energy invested in my work at Walden. 

00:00:45
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Okay. Here, so, how many of you all have ever driven in a car, from point A to point B? Good. We're still, okay. How many of you all are at the American Counseling Association at Cinncinnati? Just kidding, all right. All right. So you know that if you drive from point A to point B, there's the map and then there's the territory. So here's the map of our, our time together. We're gonna give you a brief introduction of the terms, some of the salient issues that occur when working with sexual minority youth. And then what we're gonna do is, we're gonna do not one, cause you all are lucky, we're gonna do two role plays, uh, this afternoon. And, and I, I want you, well, actually it's still morning, feel free to, as you're watching, take notes. Cause we wanna absolutely answer your questions and, and give you our therapeutic perspective. Both at what it was, how we felt as the counselor and how we feel as the client. And then we'll switch and she'll be the counselor and I'll be the client. How's that sound? Now that's the map. You never know where it's gonna go. All right. 

00:01:45
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN And, and so, as you think about working with someone who honors you with questioning sexual orientation, it really is an honor. And here, here's the deal - the onus is on you to prove to me, you're safe. Cause I assume you're homo-prejudice. I assume, that you're gonna let me down. So I'm watching. I'm taking in every way you look at me, how you talk to me, what's on your desk, what your pictures are and certainly what's not there. So you have really one chance with me, a-, as an adolescent. Again, true across the board, but particularly true with adolescents who are struggling with sexual orientation. You've one chance, so if I go to yo-, if I come to you and I say, 'You know, I, you know, this is going to sound so, uh, weird. I mean, I just, I, it's gonna be so, I, I, I can't believe I'm even telling you this, but I mean I, I, I don't know. I think I, I don't know. This girl I, I, I mean I'm not saying I like girls, but I, I think I.' All you have to do, is look away. You're one of them and I can't trust you. And we know that one in three suicides are related to sexual orientation. We know about the devastating impact of cyber-bullying. So, if you leave with nothing else today, except that the awareness that I have one chance and I can be the one who gives that affirmation. Who gives that positive regard, who says 'you know, no matter if you're questioning, exploring, you're already, have been sexual, you, you have kissed, you've been erotic with a, someone of the same gender, it's okay. That's just part of'. As opposed to pathologizing and seeing it as something wrong with that person. Few more things. Couple of myths. Uh, in terms of sexual orientation, I know this is going to sound a little crazy, but it's true. Adolescents don't just wake up one day and say, 'you know, I'm really gonna piss my parents off today. I'm gonna go down to breakfast and tell 'em I'm gay'. Doesn't really happen that way. In, in, in other words, the idea is that it's, even in today's world, even when we turn on tv and there's 'Modern Family', who'd a thought. When we see and we know that same-sex marriage is being accepted by many more states. We, we know that the conversati-, conversations are happening. It's like door number two, still. There's door number one with proms and blues and pinks and, and dances and excitement and 'You're dating someone? Oh, he's so cute.' And then there's door number two, which is you're perverted, there's something wrong with you, how could you do this to us?, you don't really know what you're feeling or thinking, you've never even kissed a boy, how do you know you like girls?, just wait, what's wrong with you? That's door number two. Kids don't just wake up and choose number two. That's a myth. So, uh, one other myth is, is to discount or dismiss because that person hasn't experienced any kind of physical interaction. It's a myth. You, if fact, we know many gay, lesbian, bisexual people who've never been sexual, but still have that se-, orientation and are very firm and, and very congruent in who they are. 

00:05:15
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Does that make sense in terms of creating, I'm guessing some apprehension around, 'gosh, how can I make sure that I give off signals that say I affirm who you are, that I want, I want to be in your space, no matter what you're gonna tell me. And I want to know who you're attracted to, how you're feeling about it, because I'm gonna be the different one. But that really is what makes this the greatest profession ever, and I get to say that because I teach and I work it and I, and I love counseling but that, that's what really makes us relevant. We're, we're not about pathologizing. We're about affirming, hearing the story, contextualizing and giving the message that that is just a normal normative part of adolescence to explore. Okay. We ready? Okay. 

00:06:05
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Hi. 

00:06:10
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Hi. 

00:06:10
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN I'm Dr. Colleen Logan. 

00:06:10
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Hi. I'm Tiffany. 

00:06:10
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Hi Tiffany. I'm glad you came in today. Please, have a seat. 

00:06:15
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Okay. 

00:06:15
Colleen R. Logan 

00:06:15
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:06:15
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN I know we met briefly in, earlier today, and talked about who I am as a professional counselor and my background and my skills and, and my, um, training. And I also talked a little bit about confidentiality. I just wanted to remind you of confidentiality. Everything that you say, stays here. Except on two occasions and I think sometimes when I tell my clients of those two occasions, that they think a big net will fall down and scoop you up. But there's two occasions are if you were to talk of harming yourself or harming someone else. And, and what that would mean is, we'd have to stop the work we're doing right now and address those issues that are, would be a really paramount and important concern. But other than that, what you say here, stays here, so how can I help? 

00:07:05
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON I'm really kinda nervous. 

00:07:10
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Okay. I understand. It's, it's scary to sit across from someone and, and talk. 

00:07:15
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON I think my parents think I'm crazy. That's why they wanted me to come talk to you. 

00:07:20
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Okay. Help me understand a little bit more about how you're feeling or how your parents are communicating that they think you're crazy. 

00:07:30
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Well, uh, they just, we had a really big thing happen in our family and now when they look at me I can just kinda tell, they think I'm crazy. 

00:07:40
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Okay. All right, um, that's hard. I, I'm sorry. That must feel really painful to be thought of as crazy. But I, what happened, what, can you help me understand what happened? 

00:07:55
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Yeah, um, my guidance counselor called my parents and she wanted them to come in and talk because of some stuff that's been happening at school. So, my parents went in and talked and I was called out of class. And we had to go downstairs and talk about some stuff that's been happening with me with some of the kids at school. 

00:08:20
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Oh, gosh. That, that's big, to be called out of class. And, and your parents and the guidance counselor met with you? 

00:08:25
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Yeah. 

00:08:25
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN And wh-, what kinds of things were happen' at school? What kinds of things were being said? 

00:08:30
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Kids have been picking on me a lot, lately. Um, they didn't used to, but they, they are now. A lot of the boys and some of the girls are being kinda mean to me. And, um, the guidance counselor found out, so she called me and I talked to her and then she called my parents. I didn't know she was gonna call my parents. And then I ended up having to come talk to you, cause I think my parents think I'm crazy now that we met with the guidance counselor. 

00:09:10
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Wow, a lot's happened then. So help me understand. You said kids started picking on you and they hadn't before. And then your guidance counselor called your parents, and there's a meeting, and now your parents think you're crazy. Help me understand the kids picking on you. Wh-, what are they saying? What, what's happening? 

00:09:30
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON What are they saying? They're calling me names, um...huh, I used to get along with everybody and I, I'm really good at basketball, so everybody would want me to be on their team in gym class. And I'm usually pretty good at sports, so everybody liked having me around. This year in gym class, it's a disaster. Nobody really wants to pick me. I get picked last, even for basketball, on their team because...huh... There's this girl in my gym class who's really pretty. She's really, really pretty. And I mentioned to somebody that I thought she was pretty. And the other girl, Cassie, said, 'Oh, she's okay.' And I was thinking, no, I think she's beautiful and I said that she was beautiful and then people started making assumptions about why I thought the girl was so beautiful. And I just think that she's really beautiful. And... that person told somebody and kids started calling me names and people started being really mean and writing 'lesie' on my locker, and... 

00:10:50
Colleen R. Logan 

00:10:55
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Wow. I'm seeing a lot of pain in your eyes when you talk about a couple of things. When you talk about really being good at sports, and, and basketball, in particular, and being on the teams and no one picks you anymore for their team. And then saying that you thought a girl was really pretty and somebody told other girls and now they're writing 'lesie'. Oh, how painful. 

00:11:20
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:11:25
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON They look at me funny. Even my English teacher looks at me kinda funny and, but you're not. 

00:11:30
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN I, I what I'm hearing, is that you think this girl, Cassie? 

00:11:35
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON No, Cassie's the one I told. 

00:11:40
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN The one you told. You think this other girl is really pretty. I mean really pretty. 

00:11:45
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Really pretty. 

00:11:45
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Yeah, I understand that. What I am har-, having a problem hearing, for your sake, is that other kids are making fun of you and, and not letting you be, be a part of, and that even a teacher is treating you different. 

00:12:05
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON People don't even want to sit with me at lunch anymore. 

00:12:15
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Sorry. That has to be so painful. So when you talk about this other girl being pretty, help me understand what that means for you. 

00:12:25
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Um, just when I look at her. It just feels different than when I look at other people. She's just really beautiful and she was pretty last year in 7th grade, but it's different, for some reason, this year. She's really nice and we're friends, but I haven't talked to her in the last two weeks, since all this stuff has happened, because I don't know if she's going to talk to me. People might tease her too or ignore her too or she might get called down to the office too, or... 

00:13:00
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN So help me, help me understand that different feeling. You said it, it feels different inside. What, what do you mean? 

00:13:10
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Um... 

00:13:10
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN What does that feel like? 

00:13:15
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON It's like my chest pounds, or, it just feels, I mean it makes me smile when I talk about her, but only in here cause I can't really talk about it anywhere else. I just... But anyway, in here, since you're lettin' me talk about it, it's just really, I don't know, it just feels really weird. I've never felt like this when I've looked at somebody else's face before or, like, when we were still talking, we had a group project together once in school. It just felt nice to be around her, you know. I think about her sometimes, at home. Um, I don't know. It's just, it's different. 

00:13:55
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Right. And, uh, when you talk about her you smile and it sounds like you're excited when you think about seeing her or working with her. And I also heard you're being protective of her. You've actually stopped talking to her, so that she won't be made fun of. So, I appreciate you doing that, although I, I don't, I really hate that you have to do that, because what I'm hearing is you thinks she's attractive. 

00:14:20
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Yeah. 

00:14:20
Colleen R. Logan 

00:14:20
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN And that's okay. So help me understand the, how your parents reacted or how that meeting occurred, and what was said and... Cause that sounds like it's still pretty jagged for you. 

00:14:30
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:14:30
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Yeah. My parents, they're looking at me weird. I don't know exactly what that look means, but my mom said no matter what happens she'll always love me. My dad hasn't said much, um, which is good, maybe. He hasn't said anything bad. My sister's kinda weird. She's all over the place. She's in the 7th grade, um, but, anyway, they had this meeting because I guess there's some other parents and other kids who are all upset, because they think I'm gonna make their kids like me, and, um... 

00:15:10
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN So, okay. Here, I don't know if I'm hearing this right. So these kids hav-, are making fun of you and then your parents got called in by the guidance counselor, because other parents...called...? 

00:15:20
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Cause, there's just all kinds of drama going on in school now. So there are kids that won't sit with me, there're people writing stuff on my locker, there's other people whose parents have called the school, I guess. Everybody's all upset because of me. Because I said somebody was really pretty. I haven't done anything. I didn't steal her stuff. I didn't hit her. I didn't do anything to her, um, but apparently whatever they think I've done is so awful that the parents had to come. 

00:15:55
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Hmm. I, it's hard to hear and I'm sorry that you've had that experience. That yo-, people are reacting so negatively and, and rejecting you over you're having feelings for... 

00:16:05
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON I just said she was beautiful. 

00:16:10
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Right. 

00:16:10
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON I didn't do anything. 

00:16:10
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN that's right. 

00:16:15
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON But say she was beautiful. 

00:16:15
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Right and it sounds like people just took it to the next level and, and started teasing and... 

00:16:20
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Like I'm some kind of perv or... 

00:16:25
[sil.] 

00:16:25
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON ...but it makes me really kinda sad. 

00:16:35
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Yeah. I, I can imagine it. So you said your parents, your mom says she loves you no matter what and your dad is acting differently towards you, be distan-, have you told, what have you talked about with your parents? 

00:16:45
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Not much. 

00:16:45
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN So it's just based on kids reacting or parents reacting to your having, you're making a comment about someone being pretty. Am I...? 

00:16:55
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON That's what it feels like. It's like the, the thing we just don't talk about. We know that there's something weird and there's something wrong, but my parents aren't saying much about it. So I feel weird when I'm at home, cause I know they feel weird about me. And I feel weird at school cause I'm eating by myself. I don't want to eat with my sister, because then people might be mean to her. I don't want to eat with my friends, who were my friends, cause they're not sitting with me anymore. It's like I have the touch. Nobody wants to be around me, cause they'll catch it. But I was cool not that long ago. 

00:17:30
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Uh, how lonely that must feel, and so confusing. And you said, seemed like just a minute ago you were part of, and now you're being pushed away. 

00:17:40
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON They treat me like Dominic. There's a kid that everybody just teases, nobody even knows why. They've been teasing him since 1st grade. And it's like I'm, I should be eating with him now or something. 

00:17:50
Colleen R. Logan 

00:17:55
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN So when you talk to your friends or do, does, are they a-, able to talk to you other than this particular comment that you made to one girl. 

00:18:05
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:18:05
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Not really. Um, one of my friends still calls me at night. Like when we're at home, she'll call. But nobody's really hanging out with me. It's like I smell bad or something. Nobody wants to be around me, because I guess they think they'll get teased and... 

00:18:25
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Let me back up so that you know that in here what I'm thinking and feeling. So, it sounds like you've got a lot of negative reaction based on making a comment to a girl. What I'm hearing is that you thought that a girl was really pretty, and that you have some, how your heart pounds, and you kind of have these feelings when you see that girl. Okay. That makes sense. I mean, that's part of your journey, right now, as an adolescent to have those feelings and figure out what that means and what it doesn't mean. So what you're doing is really what you're supposed to be doing. 

00:19:00
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON I wish everybody at school felt like that. 

00:19:00
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Right. Ab-, absolutely. So, I think that's really the work that, that you and I can do is how can you deal with how other people are reacting to what is absolutely appropriate in the task and what you should be doing right now. Including, you know, whenever people say mean things or, or write mean names saying, 'I, please don't treat me that way,' and learning ways to say, 'no, I, I, please don't say those words, please don't make, make, make fun of me or call me names' and, if that doesn't work, to find a safe person there at the school. Perhaps the guidance counselor and talk to her, or him, about this is happening. People are calling me names and, and, and really hurting me and, and, and to leave you out and to reject you, that really is harsh. And, and something you could get support from the guidance counselor about. 

00:19:55
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON You think that the guidance counselor would do that? 

00:20:00
Colleen R. Logan 

00:20:00
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Well, I think what you and I can do, is practice on how you would talk to the guidance counselor. And here's the thing about school counselors; a little different from how I work. They're about everybody gets to go to school in a safe place and there really are very important policies or laws about not teasing, not rejecting, which is a, actually, kind of, a social form of bullying. And so a counselor has to take that seriously and has to help. And I can help you talk to the counselor too and help you practice in doing that. You sh-, you get, this is okay. You get to have these feelings and explore and, and you're okay. 

00:20:40
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON I'm okay. 

00:20:40
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN You're okay, just as you are. 

00:20:45
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:20:45
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Okay... Hm-mm...I like talking to you. 

00:20:55
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN I like talking to you. 

00:20:55
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON I wish everybody would be okay for me to talk to. I used to be cool, not long, it wasn't a long time ago. 

00:21:05
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Right. I know that's part of what's confusing and so painful, that all, all you did was make a comment, and all of a sudden everything's fruit basket turn over. Must be so hard. 

00:21:20
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON say I look at her funny but, yeah, that's all I did. I didn't, I didn't hurt anybody. 

00:21:25
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Right. Absolutely. Agreed. 

00:21:25
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON But they all want to hurt me. 

00:21:30
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN You know, it, he-, here, today, you know, people don't always understand, whenever, you know, kids will say things that don't make sense in how things are supposed to be and so, instead of trying to understand it, sometimes kids, sometimes adults step all over it. And, and discount and don't validate. But we, in here, you're okay. And we're gonna figure out how you can talk about what is absolutely okay. 

00:22:05
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Okay. All right. 

00:22:10
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN All right, so I'd like to meet with you again in a week. Would that work? 

00:22:15
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Yeah. My mom told me I had to come at least three times anyway, so okay. 

00:22:20
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Okay. All right. Thank you. All right. 

00:22:30
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN We're gonna switch right into another role play unless you feel something we need to talk about right now. Okay. All right. 

00:22:45
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Hi Colleen. 

00:22:45
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Yeah. Hi. 

00:22:45
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Hi. My name is Tiffany Rush-Wilson. I'm gonna be talking to you a little bit today. 

00:22:50
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Well, you can talk. 

00:22:55
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Okay. Sounds good. 

00:22:55
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN I'm just gonna be here. 

00:22:55
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:22:55
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Well, you can be here. I'm glad you're here. I want to start off with this, like we talked about in the waiting room. Everything that we say in this room, stays in these four walls. 

00:23:05
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Oh, so you're not gonna tell me parents? 

00:23:05
Colleen R. Logan 

00:23:05
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON There are two exceptions that you need to be aware of. If you're gonna hurt yourself or if somebody else is gonna be hurt, then we may have to bring your parents in to keep everybody safe, okay? Um, but generally what you say in this room, stays in this room. If there's something I think your parents need to know, we'll talk about that too and I may actually ask them to come in so that we can share whatever we need to share in front of them. I don't want to do things behind your back. I want you to be a part of this. 

00:23:35
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Okay, well. All right. 

00:23:35
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Okay? 

00:23:35
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Ah, I guess I, okay. Yeah. 

00:23:40
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON All right. 

00:23:40
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Start talking. 

00:23:40
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON All right, so what I'd like to know is, what brings you in today? 

00:23:45
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Uh, my sister's gone crazy. 

00:23:45
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Your sister's gone crazy? 

00:23:50
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Yeah. 

00:23:50
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Okay. 

00:23:50
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Crazy (whistles). 

00:23:50
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Alright. 

00:23:50
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Crazy. 

00:23:50
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON What's happened? 

00:23:55
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Uh, well. You know, everything's going along. We're just living life. She's a pain. I mean, that's just a given. And somehow there's all this scramble about my parents have to go to school, there has to be a meeting and it comes out she's crazy. She's gone crazy. Crazy. And weird and disgusting and ew. Crazy. 

00:24:20
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Okay. I saw on your intake form that your sister's 14, that you're 13. You're pretty close in age. You're at the same school, where all this is taking place? 

00:24:25
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Yeah. We go to the same school. That's part of the problem. That's what. I mean, that's, her craziness is affecting me. My life and who I am and my school. 

00:24:40
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON As I'm sitting here talking to you, Colleen, I can sense that you're feeling a little irritated by what's going on with your sister. 

00:24:45
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Well, yeah. I get, I mean, really? I, I'm just trying, uh, if she would just act normal or go away, not in that order. It'd would be great. 

00:25:00
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Tell me a little bit about crazy. What's happened? 

00:25:00
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Well, I mean like I said we go to the sa-, school and then the parents come in and she's I don't know if this will even make sense to you but she thinks she's gay. Okay. How can you think you're gay, seriously, at 14? You can't think you're gay. Well even if you think you're gay, don't be. And then, my parents, there're people are calling her names and I, I'm like you cannot be gay. I so don't have time for you to be gay. Please would you just get with boys. Come on. You can't, your four-, you don't even, you haven't even kissed a boy. Seriously now you're gay. I mean, what are trying to do? Ruin my life? 

00:25:40
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Seems like you've got a lot of feelings around your sister's life and how that's affecting you right now. And I'm also sensing that you sound like you might even be a little embarrassed by what's going on with her. 

00:25:50
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Mort-i- fied! 

00:25:55
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Mortified? 

00:25:55
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Mortified. I mean she is ruining my social life and, again, she's my sister and so there's no way she's gay. I mean, we're related, so there's no way she's gay. I, I just think it's like a big thing so she can get all the attention. I'll show attention. I mean, I'm so mad at her, I mean I get why the kids are making fun of her. I'm making fun of her. 

00:26:20
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Wow. 

00:26:20
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN I mean, come... I mean, huh.... huh...good-bye to 5th grade. I mean, unless she gets her act together and starts kissing and being with boys. 

00:26:30
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON And that would make everything okay for you? 

00:26:35
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Exactly. 

00:26:35
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON That's what you want for your sister? To make everything okay? 

00:26:35
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Well, because she's making everything not okay for me by this little drama. I don't know why, who she thinks she's trying to get upset or tryin' to get mad or getting' my parents to be about her...okay, we, get that over in a minute now, now get back to normal. 

00:26:50
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:26:55
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON I would like to know a little bit about the relationship between you and your sister. Tell me how you've gotten along up until this point. 

00:27:00
Colleen R. LoganOh we were clo-, we'd do everything together. We, we, have the same room...oh, right we're, oh, yeah, anyway...we're in the same room and we love to hang out, except when she's annoying, but we'd play games and we're pretty athletic, and...oh, yeah. They don't even want her on the sports teams anymore because she's gay. She's acting gay. She's saying she's gay. I mean we were really close but now with this. No way. I don't, I don't want her to even been in the room. I, I put stuff in front of the door. I mean...(crosstalk) 

00:27:30
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Wow. 

00:27:30
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN ...don't come in this room. Don't talk to me at school. Don't, don't talk at all, in fact, until you fly right and act right and stop this business. Mm-mm, we're done. 

00:27:40
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON You've been pretty close up until this point, but now, given that she's told people that she might be gay, as you stated, you're not really interested in having the same relationship with your sister? I wonder how that feels. 

00:27:55
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN For me, it feels good. Because now I don't have to deal with her mess. 

00:28:00
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Okay. And I wonder how it feels for her. 

00:28:00
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN She's in a, I don't know how she feels because she's just a mess. I mean she cries every day and everything. I mean, I would too if I were trying to say I was gay at 13. I'd cry every day too. In fact, I feel like crying now. Just thinking about what she's doing to me. 

00:28:15
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON What she's doing to you? 

00:28:15
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Right and, well, and here's the thing. You know I told you we have the same room? 

00:28:25
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Mm-hmm. 

00:28:25
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN All right, let's just say. Okay. Let, what if she is horrible like that? What if she's gay? I haven't told anybody this, so I don't, I haven't, I don't know. I haven't, look, okay, I'm just gonna say it. Yeah. I mean we , we, how do I even say, I mean we've been in the same room, I don't, all our liv-, I would have known that, if she were gay. I would have known. I mean we have posters up of the Beeps, I mean. I would have known. Then I think well, som-, well, when we were young, sometimes we'd curl up in the same. I, I don't even know, I mean mostly I just want her to get over it. But I mean, we'd curl up together and I mean, I don't know I just wish she'd stop. I am af-, I mean I, I try to think, well, if she's gay, how do I, I mean, what if I am? 

00:29:25
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON That's what I'm hearing you say, is you and your sister have lived in the same room your whole lives. You've been really close; you've even curled up together in the same bed. You have the same tastes in pop music and you've been really close for all this time and now there's something about her coming out that you didn't expect, you didn't know and you've got some pretty strong feelings about what she's sharing now. You don't feel as close to her? 

00:29:50
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN I, no, I, I just I'm, I'm, I'm stunned. I'm, I can't believe she's doing this. It, it just makes me so angry and I'm, I just want her to stop. And, and then I lie awake at night and think well, what if I, what if, I mean what if it's contagious. What if, like, since she feels it, what if I'm gonna turn out that way. I don't, I don't, I'm not that way. I don't, I look at boys all the time. 

00:30:15
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON So, it sounds like you're scared. And even a little confused that what's going on with your sister may actually happen to you and you don't know what to do with that idea. 

00:30:25
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Yeah, I mean, I ca-, I'm not gonna be that way. I mean, you know, my family, we're religious. I mean we, I mean we, we believe in God. We go to church on Sunday. I mean, you know what God is gonna think about my sister? I mean, it's not gonna be good, just let me say, it's not gonna be pretty. And, and, God forbid, not to use that but, God forbid that I, I am too. Then we're both gonna go to hell. I mean she can do what she wants, although I think she's gonna snap out of it any time. I, I, I mean my parents, they pray all the time. I... 

00:31:05
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:31:05
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON You know what I'm wondering about? You've been really close to your sister your, your whole life. You've shared all kinds of things, including a room, and now with this part of her life, where she's coming out and she's being honest with you and she's telling your family, people at school, I guess, to some extent she's sharing with them more information about who she is. Your relationship seems impacted, but I'm sensing that you loved your sister your whole life. You practice a religion, you're telling me, that also promotes love. Uh, I'm wondering how that love extends into your relationship with your sister? 

00:31:40
Colleen R. Logan 

00:31:45
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Well, I don't feel like I love her right now. I, she's my sister. I mean, she's my sister. I... 

00:31:50
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON You feel like you don't love her right now? 

00:31:50
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Because something's wrong with her. Very wrong. Everybody, her friends know, my family knows, school knows, she's In, something's wrong. And until she acts right, I, I'm not gonna lie. I'm mad at her. I don't really feel like I love her. I want her to go away. 

00:32:10
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON You want your sister to go away? What would that really look like for you? As close as you've been, if she were to go away, how would that be? 

00:32:25
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Well, if she came back liking boys, that would be great. 

00:32:25
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON I'm wondering something, if your sister all of a sudden decide, okay I'm gonna do everything everybody wants me to do. I'm gonna pretend like I like boys, even if I don't. I'm gonna live by these rules that everybody else created, even if they don't feel good for me and she was really unhappy livin' in that kind of box, what would that look like to you and how would that feel to you? to know she's really unhappy, but she's living this life this way, for me? 

00:32:55
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Well, I mean, when you say it like that it doesn't sound right, but it's something I want. I want her to live the way she should be, so it doesn't impact me. 

00:33:05
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON So you want her to be unhappy, so that you could feel good? 

00:33:10
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Again, it doesn't sound right coming from you. 

00:33:10
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Okay. 

00:33:10
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN What I want is her to just act right. But I don't want her to be unhappy. I mean yeah, surely she must be unhappy by feeling these feelings for girls I mean I would . It's disgusting. But I don't want her to be unhappy. 

00:33:25
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON The way your sister loves is disgusting, is what you're saying? 

00:33:30
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Again, it never sounds right coming from you. You, I mean, I want her to be happy just on her own in her own room in her own world in her own planet. Someday. But I don't wish bad on her. I just want her to stop. 

00:33:50
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Can you repeat what you said, again for me? 

00:33:50
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN I don't wish bad on her. I just want her to stop. 

00:33:55
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON So you want her to not be who she's telling you she is. But you don't wish bad on her. 

00:34:05
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Right. Doesn't make a lot of sense, I get it, but I mean I, if she would just get it together then I could just be who I am and I would, could go along and be great at school and everything would be fine. Really, she's just need to get beyond this little phase. 

00:34:20
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:34:20
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON A little phase? That's really interesting language that you've use to describe your sister. And it sounds like your sister's going through something really difficult for her right now and that she might really need the friendship that you had and you're not able to give her what you've been giving her so far. I wonder how that feels for your sister and I'm wondering how that feels for you too. 

00:34:45
Colleen R. Logan 

00:34:45
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN I'm sure that, here's what, here's, what if I am too? 

00:34:50
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON You've mentioned that twice now. Like that feels a little scary for you. 

00:34:55
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Well, I mean, now that, I mean that's, I mean, I think that's at the bottom, I, what, I mean I started thinking about well maybe I like that girl maybe I have feelings but then I, I don't want to be like her. But maybe she made me that way or maybe I want to be that way, but I don't want to be that way. And I mean, I think, well, I, I don't know. I mean, in the locker room lots of girls undress. And, I, I look. I look all the time, but I mean, I don't want to be like that. 

00:35:30
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON You don't want to be like what? 

00:35:30
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Like her? 

00:35:30
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON How is she? 

00:35:35
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN She, uh, appears to be gay. She thinks. Just to ruin my life. 

00:35:40
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON One thing we didn't talk about, what, what does it mean to be gay? 

00:35:45
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN It means like something's wrong with you and you're not gonna get married and have kids and be normal. And you're not gonna do, like find your, like somebody who's gonna sweep you off your feet and that's going to be so wonderful. A man, let me just be clear about that. Not a woman because that doesn't work. I mean I don't even know how it could work, but she's not going to have that romantic special guy like Justin, to sweep her off her feet. 

00:36:15
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON And that's what'll happen to the normal people who aren't gay? 

00:36:15
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Right. 

00:36:15
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Have you had a conversation with your sister at all about what this is like for her? You know, what she thinks her life with be like as she gets older? 

00:36:25
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN No. I, I can't even hear it. I don't want to hear it, but sounds like you're thinking I should talk to her. 

00:36:30
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON I wonder if down the road we can talk to her a little bit about that because it sounds like in your mind there's like one great way to live and if a woman and a man are together all of these wonderful things will happen but if two people who are the same, two men or two women, are together, all these bad things will happen. And I'm wondering if there are some things I can share with you over the course of the time that we work together, that might help you see things in a more balanced way. 

00:37:00
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Well, yeah. I think that would be good and maybe you could help me, I don't know, help me get right too. Cause I'm feeling wrong. All wrong. Yeah. 

00:37:05
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON The whole time we've been talking, I've been wondering if part of that wrong you're describing now is related to not having the same relationship that you very recently had with your sister, who's really close to you. Who is the same person that she's always been. But now it feels like there's a shift for you and you think she's doing things that impact your life negatively. Where she's really being more honest with you and doing things that could actually strengthen your relationship. She's telling you things that she hadn't been able to tell you, for whatever reason, before. Maybe this is a chance for the two of you to grow together as sisters. I don't know. Maybe we can talk about that a little bit as time goes on, if you're willing to come back, because I know in the beginning you let me know you weren't going to talk today. 

00:37:55
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Well, you turned out okay. 

00:37:55
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON I'm okay? 

00:37:55
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Yeah. 

00:37:55
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON I think you're pretty okay too. 

00:38:00
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Thank you. 

00:38:00
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Mm-hmm. 

00:38:05
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Okay, thank you. All right, what are your, let's, let's process both of those. What do you, what are your thoughts and reactions? 

00:38:15
[sil.] 

00:38:15
How much can you do when the client is in a hostile environment on all levels? 

00:38:15
Colleen R. Logan 

00:38:15
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN I think that you really, really got it, in terms of what we were trying to present. The idea that there is absolutely no safe space and the onus is on you. You might be the only point of safety in this, in this person's life. And, and I want that to feel as heavy and responsible as it is. You might, and, and, even if you were to have permission to interact with a counselor, or have permission to talk with, you may not be able to impact that system. Truth. Even in today's world. But if you can create that one space where that, that young lady or young man feels safe and affirmed, you've, you've made a huge difference. 

00:39:00
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:39:00
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON The other thing that I like to keep handy, are resources that I know are supportive resources, outside of the school, outside of our office that also might be helpful to that client, based on their age. So, when I was the counselor, your age, I, I wasn't sure, so I had to be careful how I spoke with you. Cause you were either a 5th grader or you were 13; or maybe you were a 5th grader who was 13, I don't know. It was a whole different counseling scenario but, um, things that are age appropriate for that person. So that if this person needs support from me and something beyond our office, I know that these resources are safe to share with this person; which means I have to call them, which means I have to listen to what they say they can provide, so that I'm not sending a client out to some place that's also toxic for them. And sometimes they have to be places that will allow the kid to access certain types of resources without the parent's consent, because the parents may not be supportive. You know, and here in this state, in Ohio, where I'm licensed, we can do that to some extent. You have to know what is possible in the jurisdiction where you practice, but also outside resources, to sum it up, are important to know. 

00:40:10
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Uh, I'm gonna just piggy-back really quickly. As, as, uh, Dr. Rush-Wilson and I were talking about doing this scenario, you know we talk about informed consent and, and the parameters of confidentiality, hurt self or hurt others, and, and there is, if somebody, if a client comes to you and says I'm struggling with my orientation or I'm questioning, is that 'harmful'? And do I have a duty to report? 

00:40:35
[sil.] 

00:40:35
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Is it harmful? If I'm in your office, I mean think, kind of think that through a minute; let that metabolize. If I come to you as a 13 year old and I'm struggling with same-sex attraction and fe-, having erotic feelings toward oth-, am I, eh, would that be, uh, a situation where you'd have to break confidentiality? And if so, if your mind is going if so, why? How is it harm? Right, right. But I think often counselors feel, this child has come to me, this young, this youth, has come to me and I have to report, because they're doing, they're struggling with orientation. Why? 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:20
Should we be careful of the terms we use in a counseling session? 

00:41:20
Colleen R. Logan 

00:41:20
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN You're absolutely right, so the, kind of the, the not the right way would have been to jump, 'Oh, sounds like you're attracted to other girls, and you may be a lesbian.' Or, right? She would have run out of my office screaming and she should have, but I think the bigger piece you're talking about is us, as counselors, being comfortable with ambiguity. And, and that's really a skill to be developed and honed. How, how to be, just in that place, where the person's exploring and questioning, and you don't get to name it. Because it's premature , it's incorrect, it's a, for a million reasons. You don't get to name it; you need to be able to sit in ambiguity with that client. That's the gift you're gonna give. 

00:42:05
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:42:05
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON And honor their right to eventually identify for themselves, their own identity. Whatever that identity may be named. 

00:42:15
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN And, and you constrain and you actually place a barrier, because if that's not who I'm thinking or what I'm thinking about and 'Oh, my gosh I don't want to be that!' You've just joined the other side. I can't trust you. Cause you're just looking to label me and categorize me. 

00:42:30
[sil.] 

00:42:30
At which point would you bring family into the session? 

00:42:30
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:42:30
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON That's funny. As I was working with you, as my client, I was thinking about, at what point am I gonna bring the sister in. We need a joint session here; they need to air some of this out, and then we are gonna need the parents in, but I would wait until I made sure I'd established a firm rapport with my client before I started to introduce the 'others' into the session. Just to make sure it was safe for everybody involved and we'd have to have some ground rules set for these other people as they entered our safe space. So that these other people don't come and disrupt the safety that we've created. 

00:43:05
[sil.] 

00:43:05
What are your thoughts on those who are financially dependent upon parents who are unaccepting of them? 

00:43:05
Colleen R. Logan 

00:43:05
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN So, I, I think they're used, certainly I'll own this from my own perspective, as I have, uh, been in this deal, advocacy and, and really passionate about these issues. You know, early on, you know, there's this idea that you come out and if you didn't come out, as if it was some static, you know, one event, kind of like Macy's Day; Macy's 24 hour sale. If you didn't do that, you were somehow, something's wrong with you, because you weren't being honest, um, you really... What I've come to realize, certainly over the last years, is that there really is a safety issue about coming out and, and it goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning of the session. Are, ar-, is it safe for me to share with you who I am? And sometime, that's the thing about coming out, that's really the decision we can make, I could make. I can decide whether to come out to you, whether it's my parent, whether it's a teacher, whether it's a friend, gauged on how safe I might be. And sometimes we need to support, as counselors, not coming out. But coming out is not static. Really it's about living out. So there may be times that I make decisions that you're not okay, you're not okay and I'm not gonna come out. That doesn't mean that I'm shame, uh, I'm not a good lesbian. They're gonna take away my card and my toaster. They're not gonna do that. It means that I'm making decisions that are really about health and personal safety. And we need to validate that. 

00:44:30
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:44:30
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON And I would just say like we said at the beginning of the conversation, or of this talk, these are still just human, normal issues. So if somebody is in a position where their coming out might put them in a position of being unsafe, then, of course, we don't want them to do anything that would put their safety in harm's way. I was honored to be able to witness the coming out processes of two people who are really important to me, and they didn't look anything alike. They were very, very different experiences. One was, 'I'm 17, here we go, everybody needs to know'. And the other one took probably a decade to eventually share with all of the people who were important in his life, this information. They looked very different, because they were different things at stake, according to these two people, we have to be mindful. 

00:45:20
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN And I, and I, I think, it was my sense, that this is an advanced skill that I want you all to have that you can, as you said it's kind of the accelerator brake and, and really giving, and maybe role-playing, but giving information about 'okay, what would this look like if you went home at Thanksgiving and said 'Hi, I'm gay!'? What would that look like? By the way, typically holiday's not a great time to do that; I'm just saying. But it's an advanced skill and, and really what it's a measure of is, is your ability, as a clinician, to understand the greater context that the person lives and interacts in. 

00:45:55
[sil.] 

00:45:55
How do you seperate your own personal experiences from that of a client's? 

00:45:55
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:45:55
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON Well, the interesting piece is I'm a heterosexual person. Um, I've actually dealt a lot with very, very close people in my life, who've come out and I take from their experiences. So when a client asks me, you know, what was this like for you, and that doesn't happen too terribly often, but sometimes it does. I'll even let them know, I'm heterosexual. I'm really very, very close to someone who had a really hard time coming out and this is what this person shared with me, just in summary, because they don't need all of the details. And how difficult it was and how proud I am that he came out and how much I really love him. He is really an important part of my life. So that I'm not at all telling this person, 'Oh, I'm straight. I have no idea what pain feels like. And what this pain feels like for you might be different than how it felt for me, but I do understand how pain feels, in and of itself, so I want to support you through that process'. So, it's an interesting piece for me to make sure I'm telling a person, 'I'm not patronizing your experience. I'm not saying that I know exactly what it is you're going through, even though I've never gone through it exactly like you, but I've witnessed how difficult it has been for people I love very much and I want to be supportive of you as you, as you go through the same thing, possibly.' 

00:47:05
Colleen R. Logan

DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN This is a, to, let me just, there's a process comment. Notice that Dr. Rush-Wilson answered first. And I think that's important, as a heterosexual person. You were asking about coming out. The idea would be, of course, the lesbian needs to tell her whole story. But really what was important, is that she has her own coming out story, in terms of her coming to terms with her heterosexual orientation. So really she's a very valid and important part of someone coming out. Because I think that would, it would discount someone's experience. She has her own ways of how she discovered who she was attracted to and who she wanted to be with, that it's just as valid as my coming out, even though mine was different. Does that make sense? There's a process. And, I think, an answer for, just quickly, for me, I think I am very, because I am a lesbian I'm really cautious. Okay, that sounds like a client is going over into that abyss of sexual orientation. I don't want to influence that in any way. And I think, and, so I'm very cautious in making sure I leave it all open and available, so that that person, I don't wanna feel like I really did influence it, so I'm very cautious and, and, and so cautious, this will stun you all, some clients think I'm heterosexual because I'm, I'm so careful about not influencing who I am or bringing who I am into the counseling relationship. You all didn't seem as stunned as I thought you would. I'm a little offended. No, I'm just kidding. So, but I mean being really cautious about not, you know, we're such a barometer, we're such an influence in the counseling relationship and not wanting to influence that process in either way. 

00:48:50

00:48:50
Elaborate on influencing the client. 

00:48:50
Colleen R. Logan 

00:48:50
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN Only in terms of dir-, like we talked about labeling, so when I say influencing by labeling it and that will shut down or maybe I'm right. Maybe I made, I could not, you know, there's this idea that if I, if I, if you stand around me long enough I can make you lesbian. So far it hasn't been true in 49 years. Can you do that? But not influence in terms of change the orientation, influence in terms of labeling and then that influencing how our relationship might move forward or not. Does that make sense? 

00:49:20
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:49:20
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON And with minors, you have to also be careful because they have parents. And parents and families sometimes really don't want you to be affirming to this child, this under 18 year old person who they still legally control and literally when I said up here with her earlier, just yesterday I had to be very careful with how I worked with a girl who came out to me in the first 30 seconds she was in the room. But her mom, who was in the waiting room, um, is not privy to that same information. So I have to be very careful with how I'll proceed, because mom is gonna look at me and go you're one of me, you're like me, you're not influence her and support this craziness that she's about to think is normal. And, in all honesty, I'm affirming to this child, whoever she is, and there's a balance to be struck there too. We have to be very mindful of labeling and naming and balancing this relationship between these two people who are gonna have to get in the car and ride home together and live together when I'm not in the room. 

00:50:25
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN I have one other little, uh, and then I want to come to Michael. So, this whole idea of it, of whether we can make someone heterosexual or make someone, uh, lesbian or gay. Has anybody heard of the, uh, Repairative Therapy? R-E-P-A-I-R, ha ha. There's no data to support that, um, but probably in my work the most dramatic case of that, I had a couple who, uh, were soul mates, had been married for 10 years and in, in that relationship, the man was able to come to terms with that he was actually incongruent, and was female. And so as he would be more healthy and reach optimum functioning and be more female, including, you know, taking, uh, uh, hormones and, and dressing as a woman, his wife, who loved him with every cell of her body, was not lesbian. So as he was more female and more healthy and congruent, she was more unhappy and depressed and incongruent, because she's not a lesbian. And although she tried to love her wife, now, she couldn't. So he would try, she would, as 'she'would go back to being 'he', dysfunctional, unhappy, depressed, and she would flourish. And there was no way I could have made her a lesbian, nor could I have made her a man. In their healthiest, they were not compatible. And it was gut-wrenching and terrible and we had to work through a lot of grief. But in that ca-, you know, if anything convinced me you couldn't make someone someway, it was that. They would have. Exactly, I, she would, my client would cry, 'If only I could be a lesbian. If only I could be sexual with her, but I can't. 

00:52:15

00:52:15
Are there risks for the client if they are not receiving outside support? 

00:52:15
Colleen R. Logan 

00:52:15
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN When it's that isolating, every session has to be an assessment for risk. Suicide, in particular, or self-harming in any form or fashion, because it just if you are the only piece and, and she keeps coming in and talking about how horrendous life is, whether it's family, school, then assess, assess. I mean, just every session has to be an assessment of 'is this person hurting enough to harm, self-harm or harm others, actually. As, as a reaction to, um, being so oppressed. 

00:52:50
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:52:50
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON I would not say anything different. Absolutely. With adolescent clients, in all honesty, I assess for risk quite often, regardless of the reason that they're coming in, because there can be such changes, hormonal based changes for some and then other types of changes too. Just from session to session. Um, I have some of my adolescent clients who will actually text my work phone. Just to say 'I'm okay today.' And that's, that's good. You can text every day if you want to, I don't have to talk to you every day, but for some in particular, I do have to assess to make sure they're safe. One I'm thinking of right now where sexual orientation is the concern we do have to be in touch, quite regularly; just because she's a teenager and it's really difficult sometimes to be different than everybody else. In her mind, she's different than everybody else. She's not really different than everybody else. 

00:53:45

00:53:45
In what way would you counsel an asexual client? 

00:53:45
Tiffany Rush-Wilson 

00:53:45
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON You know, I can think of one person. She was actually in her 30s who came with just that concern and my initial reaction was 'Oh, that's weird.' And I had to work through that myself. 

00:53:55
UNKNOWN In my head, that's what I said too. Cause I was like, I couldn't image, but, yeah. 

00:53:55
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON And had to work, actually I was still under supervision then, with my supervisor on how do I support this person who is coming to me saying, I'm actually pretty happy in my own skin, but everybody else thinks I'm weird, and that's what's driving the anxiety for me. That they all believe I should by now, not only be in a relationship, I should have some kids and all kinds of stuff and I just, I'm okay like this. And as the relationship develops, you build enough rapport with that person, that you can explore these other pieces. Is your asexuality, um, a mask for trauma that you're hiding? Is it really just congruent with who you are, is there something else goin' on? You know, given presentation can have so many different underlying causes or no causes. As you develop the relationship, I think you're able to more easily test out these hypotheses. Because for me it was kind of a 'Oh, well, that's weird.' 

00:54:55
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN I wanna extend huge gratitude to my colleague, Dr. Tiffany Rush-Wilson. She readily agreed to be part of this and not knowing exactly what she was getting herself into. And, and just, we've been working together on this several months and just talking it through in how did we want to illustrate but also how to talk about all the issues we've encountered and you're extraordinary, as a friend and a colleague. And I, it's an honor to work with you in this new way. 

00:55:20
DR. TIFFANY RUSH-WILSON It's an honor to work with you always. Thank you. 

00:55:25
DR. COLLEEN R. LOGAN And for you all, thank you for coming on the last day. That sounds soozical, 'on the last day, of the last session, on the L word...', but I mean that genuinely and I really want to leave you with this piece. And that is, the onus is on you to show me, you're okay and safe to share me. Thank you.
