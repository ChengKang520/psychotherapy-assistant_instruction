Microtraining Associates, Inc. presents Spirituality in Counseling Hosted by Samuel T. Gladding and Michele Kielty Briggs 

00:00:25
LINDA MCKINNISH BRIDGES Adjunct Professor, School of Divinity Wake Forest University This spirituality of course has been a loaded term and often those who are in traditional religions in many ways we will reject the terms, so it's a good idea to think about the bare-bone definition. And to give a bare-bone definition spirituality, eventhough I come from a particular religious tradition and I'm deeply embedded in a traditional organized system of the word religion, I see it simply as being awake. 

00:01:00
BILL J. LEONARD Dean, School of Divinity Wake Forest University Spirituality is in many ways ah… the practice of the presence of the other that would be my classic definition of it. Ah… it is a recognition of both transcendence ah… something that is beyond ourselves and imminence something that it can be discovered within the self. And the search for that is what, for, for those, that kind of imminence and transcendence in human life is what spirituality is about in its most basic sense. 

00:01:40
LYNN NEAL Assistant Professor of Religion Wake Forest University It helps us to find who we are and how we want to be in the world. I think it's a primary marker of our identity and as such it helps give people a sense of meaning and purpose in their lives. 

00:01:50
SIMEON ILESANMI Professor of Religion Wake Forest University It is important because it's a, provides a sense of meaning to, to human lives ah… to people who are spiritual if life is devoid of their own understanding of a, this spiritual focus, life will be very meaningless. It will be very empty. So, and you might say that it adds value to human existence. And definitely, people who are spiritual would be prepared to tell you that the quality of their own existence is radically different from those who are not spiritual and so it's a, provides a basis for hope, for meaning and for a direction in life. And it is not just in individual sense, it also has social ah… implications. And so, spirituality is a, is really a very important aspect of human life. 

00:03:00
JAMES L. FORD Associate Professor of Religion Wake Forest University The notion and understanding spirituality has changed a bit overtime and in particular in the later part of the 20th century, so that now when someone is asked, are you religious? and they respond well I'm not religious, but I'm spiritual. They are making a distinction between religion and spirituality that is somewhat unique that has, that reflects a change in consciousness about spirituality. And there you could talk about spirituality in an ecological sense for example or spirituality in sort of a new age sense that is in some ways critical of religion that it is a notion of spirituality that it's not tied to dogma or to exclusivity or to some authoritarian structure. So, I would say in general though, spirituality has to do with this orientation to life that is informed by a relationship with something that transcendence this world and even ourselves.

SAMUEL T. GLADDING I'm Sam Gladding. 

00:03:55
MICHELE KIELTY BRIGGS I'm Michelle Kielty Briggs. 

00:04:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Professor of Counseling Wake Forest University Welcome to this presentation on Spirituality in Counseling. We hope that during this presentation, which is both didactic and experiential that you will learn more about the nature of spirituality and how it can be used in counseling. Spirituality is a difficult concept to define. The idea encompasses a variety of phenomena including experiences, beliefs and practices. While expressed culturally, spirituality transcendence culture. The word spirituality is rooted in the Latin word "spiritus" which means breath of life. When people talk about spirituality, they generally do so in regard to transcendence, meaningfulness and connectedness. Overall, spirituality is life enhancing and leads to growth at various stages of development. It, like other developmental aspects of life, is even experienced differently at particular life stages. In summary, spirituality brings a sense of connectedness to the ultimate, to nature and to other persons. It transcendence religious beliefs. 

00:05:25
MICHELE KIELTY BRIGGS Associate Professor of Counseling James Madison University Spirituality and religion are different concepts. Specifically, religion is observable, cognitive, behavioral, ritualistic and public. Spirituality can be described using words such as meaning and purpose in life; transcendence, positive interconnectedness and inner resources. Some examples from all of the world religions have spiritual practices include prayer, contemplation, meditation, sacred texts, sharing meals and ethics and guidelines for living. Spirituality has been important throughout the history of the counseling profession. We are going to highlight four individuals who brought spirituality to the forefront of the counseling profession. 

00:06:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Two of those individuals Rollo May and Abraham Maslow. Rollo May was one of the major existentialist of the 20th century. He emphasized the unity of the motion and reason. He read "Circa(ph) God" as a young man and later was friends with Paul Tillich. One of those interesting facts about Rollo May that deals a spirituality is the fact that he had tuberculosis as a young man. Rather than seeing it as a disability and a tragedy, he learned to work with it and he learned to be courageous in spite of it and to be authentic. Abraham Maslow was one of the major humanistic figures of the 20th century. We know him best forth his creation of "hierarchy of needs" of human development. He focused on positive mental health. One of those aspects of Abraham Maslow's life however, that many people don't realize is that initially he was a behaviorist and worked with the researcher Harry Harlow on rhesus monkeys in the concept of contact comfort. Later, when Maslow and his wife had their first child, Maslow gave up behaviorism and became a humanist, because he thought he could not raise his daughter in an environment that was strictly behaviorist in nature. 

00:07:55
MICHELE KIELTY BRIGGS Two other important figures were Viktor Frankl and Mary Thomas Burke. Viktor Frankl was an existentialist and he was the founder of Logotherapy, which helps client's discover a meaning. Frankl said that discovering meaning was the primary motivating force in life. Prior to World War II, Frankl was a Psychiatrist and a Neurologist and he began to conceptualize Logotherapy. During his endearment in four concentration camps, he counseled fellow prisoners and worked on his theory. Upon liberation, Frankl wrote many, many books and his best known for "Man's Search for Meaning." Mary Thomas Burke was a Catholic nun and a counselor educator at UNC, Charlotte for about 30 years. Dr. Burke was the past President of the Association for Spirituality, Ethical and Religious Values in Counseling known as ASERVIC. She wrote several books on Spirituality in Counseling with other professionals like Jane Chauvin and Judy Miranti and Dr. Burke helped assure in the latest wave of literature on Spirituality in Counseling. Dr. Burke and Dr. Miranti host of the first summit on Spirituality in Counseling at the Belmont Abbey in North Carolina in the early 1990s. At this summit, the first competencies for Spirituality in Counseling were developed. They were later endorsed by ASERVIC as well as ACA. Dr. Burke helped lay the ground work for future work on counseling and spirituality. 

00:09:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Spirituality is pervasive in life. It's also an important aspect of counseling. It can be addressed generally as well as specifically. Whenever a counselor and client talk about the meaning of life or ones purpose in life, spirituality is being addressed in a general way. 

00:09:55
Association for Spiritual, Ethical and Religious Values in Counseling (ASERVIC) Spiritual Competencies 

00:10:05
MICHELE KIELTY BRIGGS There are some specific ways that counselors can address spirituality. Our professional code of ethics as well as our CACREP standards, tell us that we should infuse spirituality in counseling in respectful ways. First, we can be aware of ourselves, our beliefs, our values, our biases and our privileges. Second, we can respect our client's background and their views, understanding how important or not religion and or spirituality are to them and how intertwined their concept of spirituality as with their culture or their ethnic background. We can include spirituality in our assessment of clients; for example, there is a form called the interval intake that can be used. We can respectfully attend to issues of spirituality as they come up. And we can also refer to other professionals if we feel that the issues are beyond our level of competency. The Association of Spiritual, Ethical and Religious Values in Counseling has developed nine competencies for Spirituality in Counseling. As we review these competencies, I'll try to give an example for something counselors can do specifically for their clients. 

00:11:25
Competency 1: Explain the difference between religion and spirituality, including similarities and differences. 

00:11:25
MICHELE KIELTY BRIGGS The first competency says that counselors can explain the difference between religion and spirituality, including similarities and differences. Counselors might be aware that there are three different worldviews. There is the western worldview, there is the eastern worldview and I'll say the naturalistic or scientific worldview. Counselors can understand where their client is coming from and what their beliefs are! 

00:11:55
Competency 2: Describes religious and spiritual beliefs and practices in a cultural context. 

00:11:55
MICHELE KIELTY BRIGGS The second competency states, that counselors can describes religious and spiritual beliefs and practices in a cultural context. So counselors can be especially attune to how multicultural and spiritual values are connected and have a deep respects for the diversity of beliefs and practices that our clients share. 

00:12:15
Competency 3: Engage in self-exploration of one's religious and spiritual beliefs in order to increase sensitivity, understanding and acceptance of diverse belief systems. 

00:12:20
MICHELE KIELTY BRIGGS The third competency is that counselors engage in self-exploration of one's religious and spiritual beliefs in order to increase sensitivity, understanding and acceptance of diverse belief systems. Counselors can be aware of their own background and worldview as well as their philosophy on life and to recognize their triggers where they may feel uncomfortable with the particular client's view or practices and counselors can resolve these issues before they work with clients. 

00:12:50
Competency 4: Describe her/his religious and/or spiritual belief system and explain various models of religious or spiritual development across the lifespan. 

00:12:50
MICHELE KIELTY BRIGGS Fourth, counselors can describe her or his religious and/or spiritual belief system and explain various models of religious or spiritual development across the lifespan. Counselors might become familiar with the developmental theories such as those of James Fowler, Ken Wilber and Robert Coles who tell us about the development of spirituality throughout the lifespan and counselors can examine themselves using those different theories. 

00:13:20
Competency 5: Demonstrate sensitivity and acceptance of a variety of religious and/or spiritual expressions in client communication. 

00:13:20
MICHELE KIELTY BRIGGS Fifth, counselors can demonstrate sensitivity and acceptance of a variety of religious and/or spiritual expressions in client communication. Counselors can use their basic counseling skills by listening, understanding and validating client experiences. 

00:13:40
Competency 6: Identify limits of her/his understanding of a client's religious or spiritual expression, and demonstrate appropriate referral skills and generate possible referral sources. 

00:13:40
MICHELE KIELTY BRIGGS Sixth, a counselor can identify the limits of his or her understanding of a client's religious or spiritual expression, and demonstrate appropriate referral skills and generate possible referral sources. So again counselors can be aware of their limits and they can have resources to share with clients if a referral as necessary. 

00:14:00
Competency 7: Assess the relevance of the religious and/or spiritual domains in the client's therapeutic issues. 

00:14:05
MICHELE KIELTY BRIGGS Seventh, counselors can assess the relevance of the religious and/or spiritual domains in the client's therapeutic issues. There are many assessment instruments available including instruments summarized in Craig Cashwell and Scott Young's book on Spirituality in Counseling and there are instruments in various other resources as well for counselors to use. 

00:14:25
Competency 8: Be sensitive to and receptive of religious and/or spiritual themes in the counseling process as befits the expressed preference of each client. 

00:14:30
MICHELE KIELTY BRIGGS Competencies eight and nine are similar. Counselors can be sensitive to and receptive of religious and/or spiritual themes in the counseling process as befits the expressed preference of each client. 

00:14:40
Competency 9: Use a client's religious and/or spiritual beliefs in the pursuit of the client's therapeutic goals as befits the client's expressed preference. 

00:14:40
MICHELE KIELTY BRIGGS And counselors can use a client's religious and/or spiritual belief in the pursuit of the client's therapeutic goals as befits the client's expressed preference. Here, counselors can take on a constructivist or pluralistic view where they work within the client's worldview and they recognize that there are many paths to a healthy spirituality. 

00:15:10
Counseling and Spiritual Issues: Struggling with Envy and Meaningfulness 

00:15:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Katie Anne I know you from, come today because you've told me there is a concern that's kind of in your life that bothering you, well the troublesome for you and I'm wondering if you would tell me about that. 

00:15:25
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah, um… so I'm just been thinking a lot, I have, I have two sisters and they both have some pretty big kind of it's in good life, I guess monumental events coming up, my older sister is going to be a mom, really soon and I'm really excited about that and about being an aunt, but kind of what's been, I guess kind of spurt some you know like you said some trouble, some feelings in me is I, I recently within the last week, kind of just found out from my sister and my mom that my younger sister who is about two and half years younger than me is probably going to be getting like engaged very soon and then, and then marry soon after that. um… and so I have, I just kind of find myself having a really hard time being very excited for her, even though, you know I'm… 

00:16:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Sure. 

00:16:25
KATIE ANNE BURT And I really like the, the guy that she is dating, um… so that's been, yeah that's just been on my mind a lot, a kind of… 

00:16:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Kind of a several feelings going in mind(ph) was, happy for your older sister that she is going to have a baby… 

00:16:40
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah. 

00:16:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And yet, happy in some ways and yet not so happy about your younger sister's situation… 

00:16:50
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah, yeah. 

00:16:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Because, maybe thinking well, shouldn't I be coming before she does in… 

00:16:55
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah, ha…ha…ha… 

00:17:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Regard to marriage in family. 

00:17:00
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah, yeah, I think that's definitely, we're just really hard because I think I don't know for some reasons in my head, I've just always thought that those kind of things should happen like If I'm older than that, you know I should get married before her and kind of be a little, it sounds, I thought like it sounds kind a silly but um… be a little ahead, a couple, like a step ahead of her and really I'm, I'm not, because I'm not married and you know that be, I guess being in school and kind of where I'm at all at least be further down the road, so… 

00:17:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Sure. 

00:17:35
KATIE ANNE BURT So, I think it's, yeah. 

00:17:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Developmentally would make sense that… 

00:17:40
KATIE ANNE BURT Hmm… yeah. Ha…ha… 

00:17:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING That you would come before her. 

00:17:40
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah. 

00:17:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And yet, this is a situation where um… she is coming before you and, and it's a kind of, it's troubling ah… 

00:17:55
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah. 

00:17:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Kind of stir something is up. 

00:17:55
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah, it does cos I think, I think it definitely makes me almost because I'm 27 and so I, I almost feel what kind of wonder like am I behind schedule of like, you know where a 27-year-old should be in life and, and then kind of also questioning like, like I too, you know hope, hope to get married and hope to have a family and so I think seeing, with both of my sisters seeing kind of their exciting things related to those things makes maybe just makes me aware of like that, that's not in… where I'm in my life I know and it's, inaudible I guess it just brings up that the feelings of like that I really hope for those things in my life. 

00:18:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING You kind of hope for those and you reflect and basically say well where am I and, and… 

00:18:55
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah. 

00:18:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Maybe, even a deeper question is um… will I get there? 

00:19:00
KATIE ANNE BURT Hmm… Yeah, that's definitely, I think there's definitely something that I, I try not to be it, because it's, it's, you know, it's not comfortable to think about what if, what if, what I hope for doesn't really happens specifically being like getting married and having a family, um… yeah. 

00:19:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And if you, if you think that, do you, I mean is there another thought behind that? 

00:19:30
KATIE ANNE BURT Um… I guess, I'm not sure. 

00:19:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Well, maybe a thought of what meaning will my life have and, and I've planned at this way… 

00:19:40
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah. 

00:19:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING If it goes this way. 

00:19:45
KATIE ANNE BURT Will I be fulfilled in my life kind of and will… yeah I think that's definitely back there and I have and I think it just makes me wonder, yeah cos I think, because I place a lot value and like the relationships in my life and, and place a lot of value on family and to me that would be the most rewarding thing in life. So, you have to think that, that to think what if that doesn't happen for me, it does make me kind of think that my life would be kind of lonely and kind of like it was missing an important piece, so not quite, not quite full like I would hope for. 

00:20:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And I know it's hard to go into that area where it's kind of, no person land. 

00:20:35
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah. 

00:20:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING But if you went there, what might happen in terms of you're seeing your life having purpose or meaning, relationships are important. 

00:20:50
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah. I think, I mean I think one thing that is helpful and I don't know if this is quite what you're asking, but I do have good friends who are older than me and who are not married and I definitely I'm able to look at them and, and see that their life has like meaning and purpose in it. 

00:21:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… 

00:21:15
KATIE ANNE BURT And so, I think, I think that's kind of helpful for me to try to almost, but it's almost like I have to convince myself that it would be okay to not have a family ah… and I think I would, I don't(ph) know probably look to maybe like my job or like my you know hobbies or friendships and things like that to find thing, you know to kind of, have meaningful pieces in my life. 

00:21:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm… Your head kind of tells you one thing of, what does your heart tells you? 

00:21:55
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah. It tells me, I mean I guess really, I feel like I'm not, I think that's why I was hard with my sister kind of that happening so soon as because I definitely, my heart feels like okay. I'm ready to commit be married and kind of live, you know obviously with that intimacy, but also the, the dailyness of life with someone like that. And so, so I think it just speaks of that, I guess that longing. 

00:22:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yeah, yeah that my heart tells me… 

00:22:30
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah. 

00:22:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING I'm ready. 

00:22:35
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah. 

00:22:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING That… 

00:22:35
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah. 

00:22:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And that are really long for this and want this and my head tells me this didn't happening… 

00:22:40
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah. Yeah, in my head also kind of tells me because I think for a long time I have a kind of try to be a really independent person who can you know I'm, I went, not really far away to college, but I'm moved kind a far way and I've moved several different times since then and so I've just try to be this really self-sufficient person and, and I think I like a lot of that about me that I can kind of pursue things that I'm interested in without feeling tie down and know that when I get to a place, I have you know, I can kind of establish meaningful relationships and stuff there, but, um… but I think there is kind of almost like battle of which one is gonna prevail, I don't know. 

00:23:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… Hmm… 

00:23:35
KATIE ANNE BURT Or, or maybe like me trying to be independent is me like trying to push down that, that desire for you know marriage or you know even, even really close friends too, but… 

00:23:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm… You worked really hard at being who you are… 

00:23:50
KATIE ANNE BURT Hmm. 

00:23:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And being independent and establishing relationships and, and so it seems again I mean that see this should come… 

00:24:05
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah. 

00:24:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Along with that… 

00:24:10
KATIE ANNE BURT Yeah. 

00:24:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Maybe… and I wonder, you talked about your friends who are older and who aren't married, the meaning and purpose they find in their life, I mean how do they do that? 

00:24:20
KATIE ANNE BURT I think, I think, when I think of some of those specific friends like I said a lot of them have, been involved in really meaningful work. 

00:24:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm. 

00:24:35
KATIE ANNE BURT They… they get, you know they get a lot of, they invest a lot of time and get a lot of, um… I think, you can see that they are making a difference and then so they get a lot of fulfillment out of that and I think most of those friends are also people that I have known from like church type settings and so find a lot of meaning in um… in having like that spiritual foundation in their life. 

00:25:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:25:05
KATIE ANNE Um… I think those are part be kind of the main… 

00:25:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Ways they do. 

00:25:05
KATIE ANNE Yeah. 

00:25:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And for you, how would… how would you do it if we… 

00:25:15
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:25:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …took that scenario your life… 

00:25:15
KATIE ANNE Yeah. 

00:25:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …went this way instead of going that way? 

00:25:20
KATIE ANNE Yeah um… I think how I'm mm… I definitely have… have a belief that you know ah… I am trying to think how I'm gonna say it… not that like I'm going to get everything good that I want in my life, but that my life really will take kind of the path it suppose to take… 

00:25:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:25:40
KATIE ANNE Um… if that make sense in… that if you know if I'm suppose… suppose to get married I guess according you know to god's plan and then I will. And so I think um… if that didn't happen, I'd just really try to take comfort in, in that belief and that I am um… that it must be the… kind of the… the right path for my life. 

00:26:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:26:10
KATIE ANNE Um… so I think I've… I've found comfort in the… in the past… 

00:26:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:26:15
KATIE ANNE …finding myself in like tougher situations um… and that's kind a helped me through I guess. 

00:26:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm… that you… that you really have a faith that… 

00:26:25
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:26:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …those things that are supposed to happen or going to happen or… 

00:26:30
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:26:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …that maybe even if… if they don't happen that you're a person enough to prevail… 

00:26:40
KATIE ANNE Yeah. 

00:26:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …through them. 

00:26:40
KATIE ANNE Yeah and that… I'm… I'm going to set that, because I think I… I… I at least easily can see in other people that their lives are really meaning full just because they exist. 

00:26:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:26:55
KATIE ANNE And so I guess the same as true for me. 

00:26:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:26:55
KATIE ANNE Even though is… you know I think is harder to believe that for myself sometimes but um… inaudible I mean I think that is kind of a foundation of meaning in life as like I'm… I'm here… 

00:27:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:27:10
KATIE ANNE I am a person. 

00:27:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:27:10
KATIE ANNE So, um… 

00:27:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And… and because I am… 

00:27:15
KATIE ANNE Yeah. 

00:27:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING But… 

00:27:20
KATIE ANNE And because… I guess, because I am then my life, it has meaning to it um… and even if certain things you know whether it's, whether it's marriage or even a job or something if… if it's not like the perfect thing that works out or it's how I now and vision in my life being, then it will still be, a valuable life. 

00:27:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:27:45
KATIE ANNE Um… and I was still be able to kind a find things that… that feel… because I think you know you can say that but you also want to live life everyday feeling like there is purpose also… 

00:27:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Sure. 

00:27:55
KATIE ANNE Um… so… 

00:28:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So kind of living in the now… 

00:28:00
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:28:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING You… you… you see some meaning and… 

00:28:05
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:28:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …and you… and… the and there're some things about your life you really like… 

00:28:10
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:28:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And that uncertainty is maybe troublesome… 

00:28:15
KATIE ANNE Yeah. 

00:28:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Ah… as well as developed mainly your… your sister is getting… 

00:28:20
KATIE ANNE Yeah. 

00:28:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …married before you arel. Ha…ha…ha… 

00:28:20
KATIE ANNE It's not sort of that and… 

00:28:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Sort of concrete. 

00:28:25
KATIE ANNE Yeah. 

00:28:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Ha…ha…ha… 

00:28:25
KATIE ANNE Yeah, and I think it kind of tangent thing of that but back to that my sister thing, I guess it's really important for me that I can get passed my own like struggle with this. 

00:28:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Um. 

00:28:40
KATIE ANNE And I may have said that earlier but… 

00:28:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Um. 

00:28:45
KATIE ANNE And… I really want to be and be able to freely express how excited I am… 

00:28:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:28:50
KATIE ANNE And not kind a have a little grudge against her alike huh… things are working now for you, ha…ha… 

00:28:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Right and they're not for me… 

00:29:00
KATIE ANNE Yeah. 

00:29:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Ha…ha… alright at least not at this point. 

00:29:00
KATIE ANNE Yeah, yeah. 

00:29:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yeah. 

00:29:00
KATIE ANNE Um… 

00:29:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yeah you really want to be joyful for her… 

00:29:05
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:29:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …and not hold back. 

00:29:10
KATIE ANNE Yeah. 

00:29:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Ah… 

00:29:10
KATIE ANNE Because I think I'd really, I mean I'd feel kind of fake if I try to fake my way through of being happy but, I feel like I'd miss add on something important to if you know the whole process of her like getting engaged and having a wedding and getting married, if wasn't excited and really with her, I feel like I'd miss out on something that was important. 

00:29:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm, hmm… hmm. 

00:29:35
KATIE ANNE Um… 

00:29:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING You'd be living less than… 

00:29:40
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hm. 

00:29:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Then you want to be it sounds like that. 

00:29:45
KATIE ANNE Yeah. 

00:29:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING That you want to be giving… 

00:29:45
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:29:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING You love her, and… and have some really good feeling about her. 

00:29:50
KATIE ANNE Yeah, we're… because we are very close and so I think um… yeah I just it is important like you said to live fully and share that moment and those moments with her. 

00:30:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm… and… and may be that relates right to you too because you want to live fully… 

00:30:10
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:30:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And have those moments. 

00:30:10
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:30:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …too so. 

00:30:15
KATIE ANNE Yeah, I do… I do want… you know one those kind for myself um… but I think it's helpful as we're… as we're talking about this that because you just kind of mention living in the movement… 

00:30:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:30:25
KATIE ANNE And that… I think that something that is really important for me and so it's also been hard that… that kind of these desires have come up you know because of my sister, because they almost makes me feel a little less content… 

00:30:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… 

00:30:40
KATIE ANNE With my life right now. 

00:30:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:30:45
KATIE ANNE And I'm not like that, because I want to be, I feel… overall I feel good about what I'm in life and what I'm doing and I do feel a lot of purpose in that… 

00:30:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:30:55
KATIE ANNE And so it's… it's hard… you know it's hard to kind of have a voice inside of me that kind a questions that because… because of those other longings does that… 

00:31:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yeah. 

00:31:10
KATIE ANNE Make sense? 

00:31:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yeah. 

00:31:10
KATIE ANNE Okay. 

00:31:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING That… hope I mean that you… if I hear you… 

00:31:15
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:31:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …you… you go in long and pretty satisfied… 

00:31:20
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:31:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …and… and have a lot of faith in who you are and what's… 

00:31:20
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:31:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …going to unfold your life and then, although, out of the blue, ha…ha…ha… 

00:31:25
KATIE ANNE Ha…ha…yeah. 

00:31:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …your sister says I am getting married and you are thinking um… this was not supposed to… 

00:31:30
KATIE ANNE Yeah, ha…ha…ha. 

00:31:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …happen first ha…ha…ha… 

00:31:35
KATIE ANNE Yeah. So… 

00:31:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yeah. 

00:31:40
KATIE ANNE …my thing is hopeful just, I don't know remembering like okay I… I… I do believe that my life is kind of going along in the direction then it suppose to and so, maybe I'll… I'll be okay, ha…ha… 

00:31:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yeah, again… 

00:32:00
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:32:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …your head and… and… 

00:32:00
KATIE ANNE Yeah ha…ha…ha… 

00:32:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …are getting it synchronized with your heart. 

00:32:00
KATIE ANNE Yeah. 

00:32:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yeah. 

00:32:05
KATIE ANNE It's kind a tricky about. 

00:32:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yeah, but you did too have a lot going forward. 

00:32:05
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:32:10

SAMUEL T. GLADDING Um… both on your life and on the situation. 

00:32:15
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:32:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yeah, I am wondering if we can talk more maybe a little later about this… 

00:32:20
KATIE ANNE Yeah. 

00:32:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING But, maybe things that you're taking away from now… 

00:32:30
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:32:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …other things that have come up that you as we end our time. 

00:32:35
KATIE ANNE Yeah, I really feel, at least right now I feel kind a better about the whole situation with my sister and… and I… I think it's been helpful to talk through it. 

00:32:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:32:45
KATIE ANNE Um… and… and just a kind of I think that kind a helps me maybe like go off my little grudge, um… 

00:32:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:32:55
KATIE ANNE And I think just kind of like I said, remembering that… that I do really have, have a lot of faith in what my life looks like and where it's going and that even if it doesn't take the direction I think it will you know there are still ways that and things that are meaningful and valuable about… about my life, um… 

00:33:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:33:20
KATIE ANNE That it would not be some like lonely, meaninglessly and any of that. 

00:33:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yes. 

00:33:25
KATIE ANNE …I was single my whole life, so… 

00:33:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Sure. 

00:33:30
KATIE ANNE Yeah! 

00:33:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING That again giving this voice how you should deal with it. 

00:33:30
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:33:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And kind of remembering who you are and… 

00:33:35
KATIE ANNE Yeah! 

00:33:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …who you've been. 

00:33:40
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm.

SAMUEL T. GLADDING …and who you are now. 

00:33:40
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm yeah.

SAMUEL T. GLADDING That's the difference. 

00:33:40
KATIE ANNE It does. 

00:33:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yeah. 

00:33:45
KATIE ANNE Because sometimes… yeah sometimes like you said the… the heart can almost kind a be such a loud voice since I that it's going to… kind of balance that out with you know what's in my head and what I know and so… 

00:34:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Thank you Katie. 

00:34:00
KATIE ANNE Yeah thank you so much. 

00:34:05
Debriefing Session: Katie Anne and Dr. Donna Henderson 

00:34:10
DR. DONNA HENDERSON So you had a chance to talk to Sam… 

00:34:10
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hm. 

00:34:10
DR. DONNA HENDERSON …about some things and um… what… what worked, what as you were going through that… 

00:34:15
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hm. 

00:34:15
DR. DONNA HENDERSON …for you, remember as times that was particularly important. 

00:34:20
KATIE ANNE Um… I think, it was… I think first of all it was just really helpful being able to just kind of talk about what I've been going through and I think sometimes it can almost feel not embarrassing but may be a little bit to kind a talk about… you know not being super excited for my younger sister… 

00:34:45
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:34:45
KATIE ANNE …who is probably getting married soon um… 

00:34:45
DR. DONNA HENDERSON So it was good that you didn't feel like that was, he was going to judge you… 

00:34:50
KATIE ANNE Yeah… yeah, because I've… yeah at someplace when I first realize that I felt like such a bad person… 

00:34:55
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:34:55
KATIE ANNE And it was um… I think it was really helpful to… to have that framed with same under in how it fits with like you know developmentally what… what I would expect in kind of hope for in um… and then just how it fits it's putting(ph) you know if… if… if I do hope to get married well it's pretty normal that these feelings would come up when I see that in someone else so… 

00:35:20
DR. DONNA HENDERSON So it sort of made it more normal? 

00:35:25
KATIE ANNE Yeah, yeah. 

00:35:25
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Okay. 

00:35:25
KATIE ANNE …and kind of made it seem to fit in… in line with, you know the things are really important to me… 

00:35:35
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Alright. 

00:35:35
KATIE ANNE And so in that kind of the things I value and… and thinking of it in terms of that it, I guess again it normalizes it because… it make sense why I'm have a, arose(ph) a kind of an internal response like this. So… 

00:35:45
DR. DONNA HENDERSON So it kind of some reminders… 

00:35:50
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:35:50
DR. DONNA HENDERSON …of things that you already know. 

00:35:50
KATIE ANNE Yeah. 

00:35:50
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:35:50
KATIE ANNE We do get to talk about that and um… in same kind of firmed to and… you know the divorcing like things in your heart and things in your head and… 

00:36:00
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:36:00
KATIE ANNE Um… and that… I think that was helpful like kind of perspective on you know things I know, things I believe then how that kind of sometimes doesn't always jive with like what I feel. 

00:36:10
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Okay. 

00:36:15
KATIE ANNE So… 

00:36:15
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Okay, so some clarification… 

00:36:15
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:36:15
DR. DONNA HENDERSON …about you… you can have this discrepant… 

00:36:20
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:36:20
DR. DONNA HENDERSON …sees in your life, yeah. 

00:36:20
KATIE ANNE Yeah, yeah okay. 

00:36:20
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Any surprises, for you? 

00:36:25
KATIE ANNE Um… I think, I was almost surprised that I feel a lot better… 

00:36:30
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Okay. 

00:36:30
KATIE ANNE …having talk to him um… because I've… not that this is like a huge, huge deal but I… 

00:36:40
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:36:40
KATIE ANNE …still have felt like this would be something that and I… I mean I still need a kind of think about it and work through it's some more but it feels like a good kind of foundation to move forward. 

00:36:50
DR. DONNA HENDERSON The burdens are little lighter? 

00:36:55
KATIE ANNE Yeah, yeah. 

00:36:55
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:36:55
KATIE ANNE So that's a good… a good surprise, but I don't think there was anything else too surprising that I can think out… 

00:37:00
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Anything that you wanted him to ask or say that you didn't hear? 

00:37:10
KATIE ANNE Um… I think, hmm… I think maybe the only thing I would've, because almost more comfortable(ph)… when I kind a talked about like me believing that my life is kind a gonna go the way that it goes um… you know like the things that are just happened, what happened, I think I was… well may be that was a surprise and not… 

00:37:40
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Oh! it's great. 

00:37:40
KATIE ANNE …this question that… that he didn't ask like where that comes from… 

00:37:45
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Um… okay. 

00:37:45
KATIE ANNE Um… but that is something that… because it's pretty resolved within me it's not like I've… I didn't feel like I needed to talk about that, but I was… maybe just surprised that didn't come up. 

00:37:55
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Okay, that the past as important maybe… 

00:38:00
KATIE ANNE Yeah. 

00:38:00
DR. DONNA HENDERSON …when she's is on… 

00:38:00
KATIE ANNE Yeah. 

00:38:00
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Alright, so anything else then that you thought it was particularly pioneered or? 

00:38:10
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm… I think I can't think everything is specific, but I think the… or maybe there is something specific, I think just being able to have same kind of say what he heard me say and kind of me hear, my own thoughts back, it was… it was… it was helpful. Um… because sometimes it's hard to like, I can't really put my finger on… on why that was helpful but… but kind of hearing someone else kind of almost affirm what I believe and… and maybe what I feel and what I hope for my life, it felt really affirming um… 

00:38:55
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Like you picked out some important things… 

00:38:55
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:38:55
DR. DONNA HENDERSON That you didn't? 

00:38:55
KATIE ANNE Yeah. 

00:38:55
DR. DONNA HENDERSON …you aren't clear about it? 

00:39:00
KATIE ANNE Yeah and then again in a… in a way that wasn't at all judgment all… 

00:39:00
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Alright. 

00:39:05
KATIE ANNE And it wasn't like well maybe… so I think yeah that was really helpful. 

00:39:05
DR. DONNA HENDERSON You feel safe? 

00:39:10
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:39:10
DR. DONNA HENDERSON To be here you are. 

00:39:10
KATIE ANNE Hmm… hmm. 

00:39:10
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Okay. 

00:39:10
KATIE ANNE Yeah. 

00:39:15
Processing the Counseling Session on Envy and Meaningfulness 

00:39:20
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hi, Sam! 

00:39:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hi, Donna! 

00:39:20
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Um… what's your impression about that session that you had with Katie Anne? 

00:39:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING I think I had multiple thoughts. One was I thought um… Katie Anne was very brave and very open ah… exploring an area that sometimes people are much more comfortable in denying… 

00:39:40
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… okay. 

00:39:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And… and so um… her openness ah… really struck me and her courage to… to go there… 

00:39:50
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:39:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …in terms of looking at her life um… I thought it was impressive. 

00:39:55
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hm. 

00:39:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Second thing that I've noticed about the session was how Katie Anne looked at the present as well as the past as well as her future. 

00:40:10
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Okay. 

00:40:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So she was looking at all aspects of her life and I thought that was very healthy… 

00:40:15
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:40:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING ah… to do, and I guess the third thing was just some resolution not that everything is resolved at this point… 

00:40:20
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:40:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …but they're giving voice to what was ah… troublesome for her was helpful to her. 

00:40:30
DR. DONNA HENDERSON And I noticed when I was listening that she used the meanings several times… 

00:40:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:40:35
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Um… can you talk about that a little bit? 

00:40:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Alright, I think when we look at the area of spirituality… 

00:40:40
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:40:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING We look at meaning and purpose of the people who are out there that we look at our people like Rollo May or Viktor Frankl or Mother Teresa or others like that Mary Thomas Burke, um… we look at those people and deep down inside their spiritual whether they're religious ah… or not, and I just ah… thought it was ah… significant that um… that all of them have meaning and purpose… 

00:41:10
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:41:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And I was trying to get it that with Katie Anne without using necessarily the word spirituality… 

00:41:20
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:41:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …although I know she would be comfortable with that word, I thought it was ah… 

00:41:25
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Yeah, that she said… 

00:41:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING If you're rout(ph). 

00:41:25
DR. DONNA HENDERSON …in fact she said faith… 

00:41:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm… 

00:41:30
DR. DONNA HENDERSON …two or three times. 

00:41:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING She did. 

00:41:30
DR. DONNA HENDERSON And I noticed that um… you used her words… 

00:41:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:41:35
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Professor of Counseling Wake Forest University… to put in that frame. 

00:41:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:41:35
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Also so um… anything about that, that seems important to you, if you pick up um… I mean she mentioned that you seem to pick up the important things with all that she gave you. 

00:41:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm… I think like in any counseling session wanting(ph) to reflect back… 

00:41:55
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:41:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …words and yet lead forward… 

00:41:55
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:41:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …ah… to so, I was… aware of developmental factors of… of… of um… meeting her or trying to meet her where she was in terms of the word she was using and the thought she was having and the feeling she was having and yet talking it little further a long such as, how are your friends handling… 

00:42:20
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:42:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …the situation, um… 

00:42:20
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:42:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …um… given their lives. 

00:42:25
DR. DONNA HENDERSON And put her some examples that you have about that so you helped her making more concrete also. 

00:42:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm… I think people have models but that there are… 

00:42:35
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:42:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …ah… spiritual models or… or um… developmental models, that is much easier to live their life and with Katie Anne, I thought if their models out there that she can hook onto ah… all the better because like may not be that way… 

00:42:50
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:42:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING But if it is that way, then um… then there are is some people you can emulate. 

00:42:55
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm… okay. Anything else about it that you felt was particularly important? 

00:43:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Well I think um… one of those things that… that I just noticed within me, because I think we all do some of our own work in counseling… 

00:43:15
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Right, right. 

00:43:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING ah… the counselor ah… in working with clients is, I was late in marrying… 

00:43:20
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:43:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …and so when Katie Anne was expressing… 

00:43:25
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:43:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …her feelings to me and her thoughts to me, I thought I… I really have been there um… in… in many ways um… not just in my head but in my heart. 

00:43:35
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:43:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And ah… and so I could feel I think a little deeper therefore ah… Katie Anne then maybe I could for someone who may've brought another type of situation. 

00:43:45
DR. DONNA HENDERSON That you are quite as familiar with that. 

00:43:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Right. 

00:43:50
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:43:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yeah. 

00:43:50
DR. DONNA HENDERSON One of the things that she mentioned um… was how important, it was to feel accepted… 

00:43:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… hmm. 

00:43:55
DR. DONNA HENDERSON …that she weren't judging or how did you do that? 

00:44:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Hmm… well I saw Katie Anne as… as just a very together person… 

00:44:05
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:44:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And um… I've known her for a… a few months now and seen how she acts and, and I thought um… it's… it's like you don't have to have all the trappings of… 

00:44:20
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm. 

00:44:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …of life to be a whole person. 

00:44:25
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Okay. 

00:44:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And um… and living authentically, which I think Katie Anne is doing and what see expressed… 

00:44:30
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:44:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …that she was doing… 

00:44:30
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:44:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING ah… and even what's in all in terms of, I am having these thoughts oh my goodness well… 

00:44:40
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:44:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING …I, I want to be happy for my younger sister as I am for my older sister, I thought ah… again um… that's… that's very holistic, that's very um… very commendable in terms of being a very authentic person and I thought ah… that spiritual side of her however we… 

00:45:00
DR. DONNA HENDERSON Hmm… hmm.

Conclusion 

00:45:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Spirituality permeates everything that exist in the universe, it is tied to human development, thus spirituality is impossible to exclude from life. It's part of who we are as people. Spirituality, is an important topic in counseling, because most individuals think of themselves as people who are spiritual in some way, shape or form. Our clients may not overtly discuss spiritual issues in counseling. This overlay of spirituality which is encompasses how persons live their lives is always present. If it stays covert, clients talk about it indirectly. If it becomes overt then it can be addressed more directly and usually more productively. Regardless, spirituality is an inherent part of being human. It leads to inner and outer discoveries of self and others. It leads to attitudes of appreciation and reverence regarding creation and creativity and it leads to constructive social action through reflection and discipline. Overall, spirituality is a force to acknowledge in counseling. For in so doing, we allow possibilities to become realities. And we help our clients become more integrated and better yet more holistic in living their lives to the fullest. I'm Sam Gladding…
