'Undercover Teams' A Restorative and Re-Storying anti-bullying intervention Presented to ACA Pacific Counselling Hui September, 2010 by Mike Williams Head of Student Support, Edgewater College, Auckland 

00:00:05
MIKE WILLIAMS Well, greetings to all who have come to my workshop and thank you for coming. Greetings to all those local people who have heard me speak before. And there is a number of you here that have heard me speak, so and I have been partly to these workshop, so welcome. And who have helped me clarify my thoughts through many conversations I've had about this really important topic. Greetings to our… our (inaudible ) whose stories have inspired me to find he was of being and for working. Greetings to those from overseas, especially from Australia and ah… and other Pacific nations. My name is Mike, Mike Williams and my work is based in a multicultural school, umm… Edgewater College in Auckland, (inaudible ), New Zealand. Now, before I start I'd like… really like to acknowledge my friend and colleague Dr. John Winslet from… from the state… from the California State University in San Bernadino. It is he who I look up to and I learn from. And it is he who has helped me sight my work in a consistent theoretical framework. So, a lot of the thinking that I've… that… that's come from behind this work. John has help me to explain what I'm doing, which is really quite amazing, you know I do the things and he tells me what I'm doing, which is really a unique way of working. I'm the practitioner, he is the academic and ah… although he is a practitioner as well, but he's… he's really helped me to understand what ah… what this work doesn't and how it works. And ah… there's a number of articles that we've written that have been published and… I'll refer to them at the end of this ah… this workshop. So, what I'd like to do today is to go through how the undercover teams work and why they work and ah… and I'll go through the whole process with you. Then, if we've got time in at the end, I'd like to actually do an undercover team, so you'll be part of the ah… those… the students. So, we'll have a role play and… and ah… but using a real life… a real life example of what's happened to a young girl in this case was bullied. So ah… But ah… if we just work through the… the process and work through how… how it works and I'm sure you'll have lots and lots of questions as… as… as they arise. And please ask the questions, there's a microphone on your table. So, ah… ask those questions. And if… if the question will be answered as the workshop develops, umm… then I'll explain that to you as well. So once again, welcome and… There are lots of people from schools are they from… from schools from all over the place? Yeah. Schools, yes, schools. Obviously, this work is about schools and high schools, but ah… there is a number of people that have taken the ideas behind the… the undercover teams and have used them successfully in many countries, in Singapore and in America and some places in Australia are using the ideas behind this. And I understand that there are number of schools in New Zealand, some primary schools too. So, if you like to think of how can I make this work in my school? I think it's a best way of looking at it. Umm… And you might do some variation of it, that's okay, though I haven't got a patent on this or anything like this. It's just something that I… that I'm being working on. These three girls in our schools, now you might have girls like that in your school. Those three girls that were involved in bullying. And ah… Can anybody, looking at them who do you think is a bully? You… You can't. You can't tell who is the victim and you can't tell who is the bystanders. Well, I don't even like to use those words, victim and bystander and bullies because they tend to ah… totalize a person. And even though, I might use the victim and bullying, what I'm really referring to as a person that has… has been bullying or as a person that has… has been on a receiving end of bullying. So, ah… it's… it's important for me to understand that umm… the… they're just terms that I try not to use, but some is for… for convenience, it's a way of saying them, 'cos we're all multi-storied. So, while a person might be bullying they're not a bully, 'cos there's many parts of their life where they don't bully. So, it's important to be able to first understand that umm… Then there are many stories that can be talked about… about ourselves here as well. So in this case, the girl on the left was the one that was pretty vicious bullying and the one on the middle was the girl that was target of her bullying and the girl on the other side, ah… she was one of the people that was friends and she was caught in the middle between this terrible relationship between the two girls. You can see that they look pretty happy, don't they? Well that was at the end of the undercover team. And so, this was a beautiful picture of the resolution of a… of a… some pretty strong relational aggression that was going on between the… between those girls. Just typical girls in a typical school anywhere in the world, I'm sure. Umm… But I was concerned when I was doing this work that ah… I couldn't see any long-term changes in umm… in the students who were bullying. And the problem was just being shifted to someone else. So a traditional response is to get rid of the kids, but then it just shifts them to another school and they never… they never learn how to change their behavior. 

00:05:15
Covert bullying An Australian study found that covert bullying has the potential to result in more severe psychological, social and mental health problems than overt bullying and is more difficult to detect and eliminate. 

00:05:15
MIKE WILLIAMS And this is an Australian study. They found that it was the covert aspect of bullying that was most dangerous. Umm… Unfortunately, you haven't got notes so that you can write to hand out that you can write on. So, but this… this particular ah… series will be part of the DVD that you'll get, but just take notes and if you got questions just write it down and we can talk about it. But it was the… It was the way that it was so how to see and how to find either had fantastic and tremendous sociological, social and health problems that was more difficult to detect and eliminate. In one recent case, ah… there was some very ah… some bullying going on in the class and none of the teachers knew about it. And they were quite shocked to think that there was bullying happening in the class and was… was… it was ah… it was pretty strong that the teachers didn't know. And that's… that's how… And that's why bullying survives. It's because nobody knows about at least of all adults and especially teachers. Because if you know about it, you'll do something about it. But umm… it survives really by it's… and it's… by it's own stealth. 

00:06:20

00:06:25
Traditional approaches to bullying ► Most common approach is punitive and usually involve the identification of a perpetrator(s) and a victim, isolating the perpetrator and applying punishment ► Implication (hidden curriculum) is that the right to bully is reserved for those in authority ► Relationships are not transformed or restored ► Resentment of authority a more likely outcome ► Punishment of bullies has limited effect 

00:06:25
MIKE WILLIAMS And after… When I was looking at the… the traditional approaches to bullying, it was really just about punishment and about excluding the people that were being bullied and identification of the perpetrator and ah… teaching assertiveness to victims. Well, then really that's part of the problem too, because if you're not assertive then that's a reason why you're being bullied. So, it's locating the problem of the bullying back into the student. And ah… I didn't really think that was… that was helpful. And so umm… And the part of the hidden curriculum, of course is that the bullying is reserved for those in authority. So, really it's just a… It's an example of power being used by just people higher up in the chain. And so, it was really modeling the kind of behavior that we were… wasn't… wasn't helpful. And as a result of being punished, we found or I found that students were most… more likely be resentful. And if they didn't get that kid back in the classroom, it would happen at the shops, or you know on the bus or… or somebody else would do it for them. So, it was really umm… important to think of ways of transforming the relationships that were going on in the classroom and beyond in the school grounds rather than having any sort of punishment. Of course, punishment has its limited effect as we know. 

00:07:45
The Bullies Suffer Too • Many of those bullying are locked into an identity trajectory that they cant escape from • Interferes with their learning, relationships, work, income • More likely to have difficulty maintaining relationships • More likely to abuse partners and children, alcohol and drugs in later years • More likely to have a criminal conviction by age 24 

00:07:45
MIKE WILLIAMS And this is a study by a guy called Dan Olweus. Ah… He was writing quite a few years ago. Now, when he found that, umm… that… that the last point is that the people that were bullying were more likely to have a criminal conviction by the age 24. And so, I realized that it wasn't just the people that were on the end of the bullying that was suffering it was the bullies too that was suffering. And as I… I said they're locked into some kind of person… sort of a… a narrative trajectory, a story line that they couldn't really escape from. And a lot of the kids that I spoke to, they were trapped by this and they… they… the bullying was maintained by the audience that they… that they had and kids were… were just keeping it going by the support that they were getting. And they'll most… most likely have difficulty in maintaining relationships and they're more likely to abuse their partners and children in later years. So it was… It is… It was and it's still is a big problem, not only for the people that are on the end of the bullying, but the bullies themselves. 

00:08:45
Goals of the Undercover Teams • Separate Students from close identification with bullying story • Identify a counter story • Re-author the relationship story • Work on establishing a narrative with a story that is incompatible with story of bullying • Negotiate new story from within counter story 

00:08:45
MIKE WILLIAMS So, we… we… We're trying to figure out a way that the… how the teams worked? How the under… undercover teams worked? And so, we could see that the important thing was to separate the students from the bullying story. And Michael White's most famous ah… saying is that it's not… "The person is not the problem, the problem is the problem." So when I really got a hold to that idea, I could see that what I needed to do was to find ways of… of the kids that were bullying have a… a way of doing something about it. So, we need to separate them from the bullying story. We need to help them to identify a counter-story, and to re-author the relationship story, and just find a new way of creating a space where bullying could… could… umm… could be eliminated. And there's not a team at all to apportionately blame on any person in the story, because the bullying actions are in a teams to receive, to achieve relational affix. Therefore, it seems… makes more sense of target the relation less speaks of the… of the bullying for the purpose of transforming it to a positive and peaceful relationships. 

00:09:55
Undercover Teams: How do they do it? Students who have been bullied are offered • Membership into a new 'club' that stands apart from other classroom relationships • Anonymity to gain confidence with that identity • Support from team members to try new ways of relating • Support from teachers to develop that identity • A new understanding of the impact of bullying 

00:09:55
MIKE WILLIAMS How do they do it? The students that are… that are bullying are offered membership into a new club. And this is the undercover team that stands apart from the… from other classroom relationships. They have anonymity, and their idea of being undercover is that nobody knows about their existence of the team except of course the people who are on the team and person that's doing the bullying. And the teachers are also involved in this as well. So, they know about it and they support of other. The support… And then… then the people at bullying ah… get support from team members to try new ways of… of relating and also to support from teachers to umm… to develop their new identity and a new understanding of the… of the aspects of the bullying, so the young people get a new idea about this. So when we get to a part of the… When we're telling the story, you'll get an idea of how I take the… the story down. 

00:10:50
Excuse me. 

00:10:50
MIKE WILLIAMS Sure. 

00:10:55
(Inaudible )? 

00:10:56
MIKE WILLIAMS Of course, you know there is a microphone on your table there. It might be helpful to use it, yeah. 

00:11:00
You're putting it on? 

00:11:00
MIKE WILLIAMS No, it's tuned on. 

00:11:00
Ah… Just that an issue about anonymity in the school, people know that these are having (inaudible ) umm… you know get their anonymity in their work or (inaudible ) mean by anonymity? 

00:11:13
MIKE WILLIAMS Well, the ah… The purpose of the anon… the anonymity is so that the people that… there's no, they… they're not outed or… or exposed in any way. And umm… when I'd get the team together and explain how this part works. The idea is no, for them to be no focus or any naming of anybody that's doing the bullying, because the focus is really on the actions of the bullying rather than on the person. And umm… I use ah… I get the stu… I call the students from… from… If the bullying is happening in what we call co-class in New Zealand where it's like an English class or a science class or a math class or whether all together, I call the students out from the option classes so that they're not identified as being, you know all kids coming out at once, then all the other students will say, what are they going out for? So, I make every effort that I can to try and make sure that they're not ah… they're not known for their… for their work that they're doing. I think the reason why it's important for them to be undercover or to be anonymous is so that they can do their anti-bullying activities and… and not lose face, because once they ah… realize that that's what they're doing, then often other people will make… make comments about it. So one of the hardest things for the young people is to… for it to be undercover. They find that the hardest thing of all, but they also love it as well because it… it describes the scenes of fun and the scenes of play for what is a pretty serious problem. How do they maintain that? Well, the first thing I asked them is can they keep a secret and young people, that's hard for teenagers to keep the secret. But because this work is focused on eliminating, bullying and that's the purpose of it. They always rise to it. And I've never… I had a one case where there… where the ah… where the victim came to me and said, the covers… their cover is been blown, everybody knows about them. But it didn't… it didn't matter because by that time the bullying had gone from the classroom. Umm… It's quite… Yeah there's a lot of aspects to it and I'm hoping that it'll become clear as I explain things as we go on. Does that answer the question? 

00:13:25
Yes Mike. 

00:13:25
MIKE WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:13:25
Selecting the Undercover Team • Critical part of the entire process • 6 members, in the team including two worst 'bullies' • Includes 4 members, 2 boys and 2 girls who are non-bullying and non-bullied • (Select children who can keep a secret) • Teachers consulted about the composition of the team 

00:13:30
MIKE WILLIAMS And this is the critical part of the whole process of selecting the undercover team. And umm… I get them to choose six people from their… from their class. And the six people include the people that have… the two other people that have been doing the bullying. I call them the worst bullies. But even terms like that is not really fear. But the… the people that are doing the worst bullying have got to be on the team. There's a really important reason for this and that's that umm… unless the bullies are able to change their behavior, it doesn't… it doesn't… nothing changes at all, it just keeps on going. And so, they are given an opportunity to change their behavior by observing the behavior of the other four students who don't bully and ah… are really there to support people. So, the young person, once the team starts, I get them to, umm… we go through the class list and I usually get the photographs of the class because I think it's important to work with the student to find out who they would have to be on their team. So the team comprises of six people. Umm… And in a co-ed school, I have two boys and two girls. But in a single-sex school it can be, obviously it's gotto be all boys or all girls. In a primary school, ah… teachers have been experimenting with this and they found that it can with… even with ah… with the younger people, but it doesn't really matter. But, ah… it's also helpful in… In my school there is… it's a… it's a very multi-cultural school, so we've got a range of nationalities and cultures as well. So that often helps to… to ah… add to the mix. And umm… once I…. Once we've organized the team. Yeah, I'll come. Once we've organized the team, that's when the teachers are recruited. Yeah, here is the mic. Yeah. 

00:15:05
I'm so interested that whether you use ah… cross labels as well? Whether you've done any with multi-labeled or just in the same year label class? 

00:15:15
MIKE WILLIAMS No. I haven't… I haven't looked at multi-label. I'm just focusing on the kind of bullying that happens in the classroom. And so, that's ah… The… The context of the bullying is in that class. So, if there was… if there was bullying happening across labels like an older student ah… bullying a younger one, then this put… this approach would… I wouldn't use this approach. I'd probably use a more of start of justice approach. Yeah, rather than this… this one. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:15:45
What's… What is… Is that all? I'm sure if that's (inaudible ) anyway. 

00:15:53
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:15:55
And what's… What's motivating the person with bullying behind you to want to join in your club? (Inaudible )? 

00:16:10
MIKE WILLIAMS That's a really good question. And ah… The… Most of the times they find that it's, they're locked into a behavior that they don't really, that they would like to shift, but they can't because they… It doesn't work for them in the eyes of the teachers that may work for them in the eyes of some of the kids, but in my school, particularly where there is a really anti-bullying culture, it's… it's found on and no… none of the other kids like it. So, it's really in their interest to… to… to behave in a way that is more peaceful. It's not supported by other kids, but… In general, it's not supported by other kids in the classroom. But they do it because this is what they do and it is… While it's going on it's supported by the people, but there needs to be a way of changing the motivation for bullying to realize that they can get much more of what they want through other… other means and other ways of doing things. Yeah! And it's important to have to tell them, but also another thing that happens is that the pair of the group, the four that are not bullying can exert tremendous amount of pressure on those ones to make it, to change their ways and… and act in a positive way. Yeah. 

00:17:20
So you've been saying the victim isn't included in this part? 

00:17:25
MIKE WILLIAMS No. No, they're not. They're only included in the process by their… by the way that they're invited to select the kids that they want to be on their team. Yeah. And we work together with them to ensure that. Not… It's not only the kids that they like, but the kids that are able to do something about the bullying. And sometimes it's the same… it's not the same. Ah… Especially, bullying happens in a… in a… in a year class that's ah… they're 13 or 14. And especially, if it begins at… it starts at the beginning of the… They don't always know the names of the other kids. I don't know them very well. And because they've been bullied, they're often isolated from the rest of the class, anywhere they don't feel that they belong. So, ah… it's important then to recruit the teachers and ask the teachers for their… for their input on to the best composition of the undercover team. 

00:18:20
[sil.] 

00:18:30
The Steps – A Calendar Day 1. Interview the victim by him/herself (20 min) Complete the form together if appropriate for UT approach Day 2. Assemble the Undercover team – let them begin their plan (40 min). Teachers of core class informed of existence and purpose of team Day 5. Check in with the victim to establish progress (10 min) Check with the teachers Day 7. Meet the Undercover team to check their progress and give encouragement (10 min) Day 9. Check in with victim to monitor progress Day 14. Meet the Undercover team again to plan for the long-term (10 min) 

00:18:35
MIKE WILLIAMS So, I'll just start off with the calendar. This is way that it works. This is the process that it works. You know, it takes about umm… two weeks for the… for the bullying to be eliminated. And… I often refer to this as my archives. And this contains all of the successful ah… stories of bullying elimination that have happened. And so far, up to this state I've had 30 teams. So and I've got the records of the 30 teams that have worked and all of the things that have happened. And I can often… I can use this to refer to ah… to what is… what the teams are about when the students come in and they're bit worried about how it's going to work. Because they're often never see. You know they think I've been bullied for so long, now what's this about? How is this is going to make any difference to me? But it does work. So the day one is about interview the person that has been bullied by themselves. And this takes about 20 minutes to do this. And then I complete the form together. If I think it's a suitable ah… process or suitable approach for an undercover team. Sometimes, it doesn't seem to me as if this would work. Umm… But other times… Most of the times, I think it would work. Umm… When I go back to school next term, I'm going to this… Well, I'm going to do an experiment with two kids that are bullied at a same time. So, I've never done this before, but I think it'll work. The teams will still work even though there might be two people that have been bullied. These two girls in there is they're very, very tight, very close. And they… they're being bullied because of their relationship I think. So, I’m going to set-up a team in their class, even though there is two of them together and I’ll just see how… see how that’s going to work. So day one, I get the team together. Then I… Then once I’ve heard the story, I’ve… Day one I interview the person, I take notes of what’s happening, and then day two, I assemble the team on day three. And then I'll let the teachers know about the existence of the… of there's an undercover team working in their class. Now, the school teachers know about my undercover teams because I’ve told them. And I’ve told them that that does work. So, there are altered to the changes that are occurring in the classroom once the undercover team start their work. Then the next phase is to check with the person that's being bullied to find out their progress and to give feedback to the… to the ah… to the student from the team. Umm… Sometimes, not always is bullying as… is the person is being bullied passive. Sometimes they're doing things that keep it… that keep the bullying going. So, a lot of times it is, they just pick… they just pick on a kid because they’re different, but sometimes the young people will retaliate and say things back and so in that just keeps it going. So as the process of the team develops, the monitoring process develops there is an opportunity for feedback both to the victim and to the team. And also the teachers can be proud of this process of feeding back to the team how they think the team is going too. So, that happens. And then ah… day seven, I meet with the undercover team to check their progress. And if it’s all… If it’s all being working out okay, I check with the victim to find out how the progress has been. And then if the bullying has gone, then they receive a principle certificate (inaudible ). So they like the idea of getting some food. 

00:22:00
[sil.] 

00:22:10
MIKE WILLIAMS This is… This is what happens when I interview the… the victim. No! No! 

00:22:25
Day I: Interview the Victim • Establish what has happened (the story) • Outline the Undercover Team approach as an option for the victim – explain that punishment is not involved • Work with the victim to fill out the Undercover Team sheet, including the selection of the support group • Include the teachers in the plan (and parents if young person gives permission) 

00:22:30
MIKE WILLIAMS It’s a very important part of this process is validating the story of bullying and it’s umm… And it's often times the… the young person has never had an opportunity to ah… to tell their story. And so when the young person tells his story, it’s really important because they… they’re telling an adult that is able to do something about it. So then I establish it as a story and I write it down and I’ll show you the example of the form that I used to take a copy of, an example of the story. And ah… we’ll have a… We'll have an example of that later on. Then I outline the… the option of the undercover team as an option for the person that's being bullied. And I explain the punishments not involved and nobody knows about this, and it’s just the young person themselves that are going to be helped. I’ll work with the team, work with the sheet and to… to fill out the form and I'm including the selection of the people on the team. And I discussed the dynamics in the classes well so… so when… when you’ve got a matter of the class, the photographs of all the kids in the class, it’s amazing what they can tell you about where the power lies and… and who the people that are supportive and who are the people that aren't supportive. I include the teachers in the plan and then I explain that the undercover team will device what I call a Five Point Plan to eliminate the bullying. 

00:23:55
[sil.] 

00:24:05
Guiding the “Victim” • Victim of bullying usually will have little confidence that others will want to help and whether or not it will work • Can use archives to reassure student • Student informed that teachers of core classes consulted about the composition of team and included in the process • Victim of bullying must keep the Undercover Team a secret • Student told that UT members will receive a voucher and Principals’ certificate when the bullying has gone 

00:24:05
MIKE WILLIAMS Well I may… 

00:24:05
Is it… Is it that the (inaudible ) structure of the school that encourages the victim to come forward? 

00:24:10
MIKE WILLIAMS That’s a very… That’s a very important thing to you. We have… In this… In ah… In New Zealand schools, we’ve got a… is part of the education guidelines that the schools must provide a safe emotional and physical environment for all students. So that is enshrined legislation. And ah… that’s only one thing is enshrining in legislation, it’s up to the schools to make it happen. So, I’m constantly talking about bullying to students through assemblies, teens are talking about it, teachers are talking about it. So it’s part of the school culture that we ah… it’s what (inaudible ) called a… A Whole School Approach. So, it’s everybody is gotto be behind the idea of making school a place that's safe for students. In a… In a place where it’s different, where peaceful relationships are the norm rather than umm… rather than bullying. So, you’re right. It is part of a whole school approach to… to bullying. And this is only a very tiny part of it. And most schools have got ah… various programs that are going throughout their school. They might have peer mediation, they might have peer support, they might have part of their health curriculum might be aspics that do with bullying. So this is just a tiny slice of an intervention that does work in this case. Yeah. (Inaudible ). I got lots of surprise out there. Absolutely! And you'll find that in a school that doesn’t tolerate bullying, where it’s not acceptable, you get other people bringing their friends along and saying this kid's being bullied or… And if… if they’re courageous enough, they’ll come themselves and they’ll say, I’ve been bullied. Teachers will refer students to me that they think have been bullied and parents will ring up and say that they think their son or their daughter is being bullied. Umm… But we’ve got to create in our schools the kind of environment where people feel safe to tell. And that is a big, big step forward for our students, because the reason why I think bullying is so prevalent in schools is because there’s no wonder umm… students are just ah… don’t feel as if anything has ever been done for them before or they don’t feel safe to tell an adult, because umm… In one case when a boy told a teacher that he had been bullied, the teacher got the person that was the bully up in front of the class and you know really stripped this kid down, because that person have been bullying. Well, that was just exactly the wrong thing to do and it just made that person resentful and seething and… So that boy told me, when that happened I never told another teacher. And so that he had been bullied continually, but he never told because telling is pretty wisp for lots of kids than actually umm… them keeping silent about it. That’s why I think family violence umm… is so prevalent in our schools, because the cost to a student of telling is you know as far in excess of what actually benefits comes… comes immediate. Anyway, long-term I think it’s a good thing, but initially they won’t say because they’re scared of the… the consequences. Yeah. So the victim of the bullying will usually have little confidence. They’ve told people or they haven't told people because they don’t think anything could be done. Umm… Now I’ll use my archives to reassure them if… if… if I need to. I include the teachers. I ah… I make sure that the victim can keep the existence of the undercover team a secret. And the students at that first meeting of the undercover team and they also tell the victim that… at the end of it they… they'll receive a tuck shop voucher and a principal certificate. It’s just some way of recognizing the efforts of these people to make a difference in the classroom. So, there’s another part of the motivation to is the principal certificate and that… that of course the fruit is quite big for them as well. And umm… I include the people that are in charge of the tuck shop. So I always get them to out… When a person turns out with a voucher, I ask the tuck shop people to ask them what they got the voucher for. So we’re expanding the people, the audience that are able to reinforce and support a person that ah… has been part of an undercover team. 

00:28:15
[sil.] 

00:28:20
MIKE WILLIAMS And this is… This is just an example of the form that I use. And so, I just filled in it and I’ll show you an example of a form that has been filled out. But this is the form that I’ve created. I think it’s really important for us to keep records of the work that we’re doing so that we can umm… use it for research later on or… or it just creates a… an… an important document of evidence of successful things. And then I ask them how it makes them think and feel. Then I… This is where things begin to shift. This is where the counter story starts to develop. It's the second part there, where I ask them ideally how would they like things to be. And then things really shift because it gives an opportunity for the person that’s being bullied, excuse me, to say what… how it is that they would really like. And then I have to choose six mates, six classmates. I’ve even adapted this certificate, because umm… they’re not successfully speak to the classmates, somebody pointed out to me, you know, why would they be respected when the people that are doing the bullying aren't actually respected? So, I just… It’s just six classmates that they consider to have power and influence in the class. And then this is an example of how I make the plan. And umm… the monitoring part of the process of the plan, just keeping that all together. And I can give copies of this to you any… if anybody is interested in doing this. I can send you copies of my paperwork that I use. And ah… here is an example of just my own writing of… of… of what happened. And we’re gonna use this example later on to… to ah… show how it works. And ask them how it has made them think and feel and what they want them to do and the names of the people that have been doing the bullying. That's just your pap… your paperwork or my paperwork, it's very important. 

00:30:05
Mike! 

00:30:05
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:30:05
Do you need the (inaudible ) make the feel, would you explain that briefly? 

00:30:10
MIKE WILLIAMS I'll write down exactly their words. It's their own words. This is a really important part of it is… is recording in their own words what's happened. They… They haven't told anybody and for the first time an adult has taken them seriously and has written down and recorded exactly what's been happening for them. It's heartbreaking. Umm… Here is one story. 

00:30:35
[sil.] 

00:30:45
MIKE WILLIAMS Just… You know, anyone, yeah. On Monday, it was the period after morning tea. The class was being naughty and the teacher said to line up. Mr. Toad told everyone to line up behind me. Then he said everyone line up behind Gene Craig(ph). At this school in my class, some kids call me Oompa-Loompa and No Eyebrows. And at least… At least once every two weeks. I don't usually talk to the kids in my class, because I wanna do well on my work. And if I react to the teasing, the teacher will grill me and I won't be able to do my work. One boy punches in the arm and it hurts, it's annoying. So, just a very, very simply story taken down. How did that make you feel? It makes me feel sad and depressed because of the hurt and I get angry at my mum all the time. I take it out on her. I don't talk to anybody, and it calms me down a little. And the feelings go away, and then I come back until the bullying starts again. This has been going on since I started primary and it makes me feel angry. I take it out on other people and I yell at them. It tells me I need to change but I haven't started, because I like who I am. I shouldn't have to. I've told my mum about this and she can't do anything about it. I've stopped telling her now, because I don’t want to stress her out. Ideally, how would you like things to be? I want the classroom to be a calm place, a safe environment from bullying. I wanted to stop, because it's annoying and it's going on for far too long. So this is her own story. And this is why it's powerful, because this is the story that I read back to the undercover team. 

00:32:25
Day 2: The First UT Meeting • Students not all called out of class at once better to use 'option line" • Young people will be confused and often worried • Facilitator's tone is one of concern and helplessness rather than anger and blame • Facilitator suggests working together to co-author a new story 

00:32:30
MIKE WILLIAMS So I greet the students and explain that they are not in trouble… have the undercover starts, but that they are invited on a secret mission, one that will require stealth and intrigue. They've been personally selected to remove bullying from their class and they are the best ones for it according to the student who has selected them and the teachers and the school principal. They are the experts. And there is no identification of the person that's the bully, no name is… no blame is mentioned and no names are mentioned at all, because the focus is on the bullying, not the bully. The focus is on getting rid of the bullying, not… not punishing or outing the bully in anyway. The person is not the problem, the problem is the problem. 

00:33:10
[sil.] 

00:33:15
MIKE WILLIAMS And this is what I was explaining about how I cool the students out. Umm… It's better not to cool them at once because everybody will ask them why they've gone to see their guidance counselor and so I use stealth. And sometimes I leave a note in the teacher's role and I ask the teacher to tell the student to come at lunch time or interval. So there is no way that they are able to be exposed. It's very important I think that I respect the students and show them that they've got a job to do that will require them doing something for me, but actually they're doing something for themselves. And so I try and make it as… umm… as… as much as possible there not to be any shame or any embarrassment at all about the work that they're being asked to do. They are often confused. And umm… my concern as a facilitator or as a counselor is not one of umm… helplessness or… it's one of helplessness rather than anger and blame. It's really important to… to show that you are an adult that cares and you're able to do something about it. And then we all… all work together to co-author a new story. 

00:34:20
So they know the other members of the team? 

00:34:20
MIKE WILLIAMS They know them because they are in their class. 

00:34:25
But not for all the teams? 

00:34:25
MIKE WILLIAMS They won't know until I get the team together. Then I… You know they'll… they just know who they are anyway. And that's… It's weird because when they come into the class, the two people that are the bullies,, when they come in to my room, they don't know what's going on. And I think that element of… of unsettling them is really an important part of helping them to realize that the focus is on getting rid of bullying. And umm…umm… I've had many experiences that people that have been, during the bullying they'll often, in one case umm… a boy put up his hand and said, that was me. I did that. And then… Then how do you respond to something like that? My response was, well thanks for saying that but we’re not here to apportion any blame on any person. Our job is to get rid of bullying from the class. And you’re the best people for it, because you’ve been chosen by the person that has been bullied as the best people to rid of the bullying. You’re the experts. You know how to… You know more about than anybody else. So that's how that works. Sometimes they’ll wanna shift the blame; Oh, it wasn’t me, it was her, it was him. They’ll point their finger at somebody else. The same response not interested in talking about any blame or apportioning any blame, we’re here to solve a problem and you’re the best people to do it. You are the only ones that can do it in fact, because teachers can’t, no adults can. The students are the only ones that can do it. Yeah. 

00:35:50
Mine is sort of question is something… 

00:35:50
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah, please. It’s kind of… As you can see it’s hard to talk about this because it quite a… it’s a quite a long process but it's the short process. But there is aspects to it that I can’t really cover easily in a… in a conversation like this. Yeah. 

00:36:05
(Inaudible ) not the issue of bullying but it's the bullying, it’s the behavior… 

00:36:10
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:36:10
…(inaudible ) but is the bullying being… Do… Do they take the responsibility for their actions (inaudible )? 

00:36:25
MIKE WILLIAMS That's a real… And that's another really important part because the… there is no expectations on anybody to… to… Well there is an expectation on them to change, because they’ve got an opportunity to get rid of bullying. So they are invited into a process of eliminating bullying. And sometimes the people that are doing the bullying, they won’t say anything and I’ll just be quiet, but they will stop, because the success of the team and the… the… the ah… principal certificates and the tuck shop voucher, they are not awarded until the bullying has gone. So the power shifts from the hands of the… the person that is doing the bullying into the hands of the person that is the victim. Because it’s up to them to decide when the bullying has gone. So umm… There is quite a fundament power shift. Even if they don’t do anything, even if… even if when we're working at the five point plan, even if they don’t contribute at all. I'd never had that happen, they always have. They’ve always said; Oh, I'll do this, because sometimes I feel so embarrassed and so ashamed that they have done this, especially when they are in the presence of kids that really hate bullying and they wanna do something about it. They’ll often be the first people to volunteer umm… to… to do something. And when we do the evaluations umm… and I've… I think I’ve done about 200 forms. It’s very interesting because one of the question is, what did you get most… What did you get most out of being on the undercover teams? And the bullies always say an opportunity to help people, that's what they say. Now, before… before the team, they would never have thought that this was something that they could do. But so everything shifts and they become part of the solution whereas originally they were part of the problem. Yeah, that… that happens, yeah. 

00:38:10
Umm… Do some of the bullies realize that they are bullied? 

00:38:15
MIKE WILLIAMS Well, everybody knows them. Yeah! They do, and hearing this story amplifies for them just how bad their behavior is. And… 

00:38:25
Do they realize that the behavior is (inaudible )? 

00:38:31
MIKE WILLIAMS Sometimes they will say; I’m sorry, yeah that was me. Otherwise… Other times they won’t say anything. It has taken quite a while for them to develop this reputation you see. And so it’s very hard for them to shift it. But umm… They… They ah… inevitably just become part of the team approach to working out a plan, yeah. 

00:38:55
So there is no consequence? 

00:38:55
MIKE WILLIAMS The consequence… No there is no… There is no expectation… No, there is no consequence. No, there is no consequence. There's nothing… They’re not in trouble at all. There is no consequence. They're just invited into doing something different. And inevitably they take a big challenge. 

00:39:10
Ah… There were success stories or is there (inaudible )? 

00:39:20
MIKE WILLIAMS Umm… I’ve never seen the bullying return in the same way in the same class for that same person. Sometimes umm… it will happen in another class for that same person. But, one girl she said to me ah… I asked… And part of evaluation was; What did you… What did you learn from it? And she said; I learned that I didn’t need to take it. Now, nobody told her that, but she realized as the team was working for her in one class that she didn’t need to take it. So, rather than teach her assertiveness skills, she div… sort of deep into her own life and realized that she didn’t need to take it. So, the bullying never returned for that particular person. 

00:39:55
And it wasn’t the same within the (inaudible )? 

00:40:01
MIKE WILLIAMS They never tried again, because they, they just, because of some much. I think it’s the pressure of the other kids on the, on the team. That show them that they don’t need to do those in order to be accepted. They’re also a part of a, normally they won’t associate with the kids that, a positive kids that are good kids in the class. And here they’re put into a team with people that they wouldn't normally associate with. And so there was a shift that occurs for them into changing the way that they behave. So the, the other students are modeling the kinds of behaviors that, that they have an opportunity to try it out. And they always do, yeah. 

00:40:35
Just to go back as you said, when you're developing a team do the students get a choice to participate in the process, because I’m just thinking like, the students that I am think of will go now and you go (inaudible ) and stuff like that. And they just do themselves with one to me it happened to me at the team. 

00:40:55
MIKE WILLIAMS And the way I handle it as I assume that they want to be there, I assume that they will participate in a team. And that assumption umm… ah… just seems to invite them into a way of, of a different kinds of relationships. I’ve never heard anybody says, I don’t want to do this, this is stupid, this sucks. Who wants to be on the stupid team? I’ve never heard that, because the assumption is that, there seems to be an energy that created once the, once the action play starts being developed. That they seem to go along with it, because they, they realize it they’re missing out on something if they don’t try new ways of relating to that person, yeah. 

00:41:35
Isn’t also about the context to the school itself. You say that you’re school really supports anti-bulling persistence. 

00:41:45
MIKE WILLIAMS Hmm… hmm… 

00:41:45
And if you happened to be in a school that doesn’t have a really strong commitment to that, so all the kids know, you know this is how the school is. It must be much harder to do something like this… in fact if they will be impossible. 

00:42:00
MIKE WILLIAMS I don’t think it’s impossible, I think these students could work anywhere, but I do think that as counselors that’s our responsibility, if we’re really concerned about social justice to umm… to start even today, right now thinking. I’m gonna make my school the safest place for every student in this class, in this school right now and so you’re beginning to think of what… how can you make that happen, how can you do that? Umm… Julia Gillard the, the, the new Prime Minister of Australia, she had this very interesting quote, where she, she was analyzing lots of research and she found that… the well being of students plus fun with learning meant that schools were successful. So she was saying that bullying is such a destructive umm… aspect of a young person’s life that, that’s the focus for schools should be on and eliminating bullying. So that's come from the, form the Prime Minister of Australia, so that gives me a lot of hope to think that. You know she is saying that, she… they recognize, the research recognizes that bullying is so destructive of students learning and this is got to be the focus for the Australian parliament government, yeah. 

00:43:05
Umm… I’m just wondering if umm… with those who are bullied… who are the bullies. Is there ongoing route within to is to why that bulling in the first case, what are the kind of hurts of concerns and what’s have you put them in the life that, that's the only way that… they can feel, they can be (inaudible ) back. 

00:43:26
MIKE WILLIAMS This is great, because it introduces the kids that being bully to a counselor. And umm… and often once a team is over that’s when I will work with those student, yeah. Well if not me, somebody else will. But they realized that their behavior is destructive. And that there is… that, that, that they can do something about it. Not only that, but there is also the kids that are being bullied too, being part of an undercover team or being haven’t a team set up for them gives you access as a counselor to them as well. So you can work on how hard that they be more resilient and how they can develop strategies and systems working with their parents etc. to further enhance the young person’s ability to, to umm… be resilient, bulling. So it happens on both ways but, in my experience in the way that I work, it happens after the team or it can happen during the life of the team. Because one, one person umm… I got back and said, did you know, you know there is a story about bulling. She… he said that was about me, wasn’t it. And I said yeah, it was about you umm… what, what can we do about it, how can we, how can we change things. So then the whole aspect of working with that young person that is being bulling, that has being doing bulling is able to change. But for the first time as I see, I don’t have to be like this, I don’t need to do this, there are… if… if we work on the premise that we’re multi-storied then there is another story to my life that can be strengthen, it can be thickened and it can be developed. That… it is a counter- story to the reputation that I’ve got. And I’ve had some students going right through the year 13 that were, you know no one wanted to know them in the third form because they, they come from intermediate with this reputation. And has they've gone through and has they've participated in an undercover team, they realized that this was… the one thing that they want to shake off was this reputation. And so the undercover teams do give them an opportunity to do that. I’ll present. 

00:45:25
The 5 point plan •Magic question: “ If you were going through the same thing, what would make a difference for you?” •Simple, practical, achievable ideas best •Different people can do different tasks •Plan for the reaction of those not included the support group 

00:45:30
MIKE WILLIAMS And umm… I like to use they used to ask this question about. This is what they call the miracle question. You know, if you wake up in the middle of the night and the bulling had gone umm… What would you notice? How would things be? And ah… or if, if you were going to the same thing. What will make a difference for you? So we’re asking the, the, the team to come up with some suggestions as do what they think they could do as part of their 5 point. I could… good to have a 10 point plan if you want to, one kid say’s to me the other day umm… he said can we only do five. And I said no, we can do lots more if you want to. So it wasn’t just a limit, but that just a quick thing. And then of course umm… there is a plan for the reaction of those not included and the group so that's really important to, to talk with the young people once they’re into undercover team has had the emotion and they’ve developed their plan to say, how we’re going to keep this a secret. What’s the best way we can preserve your anonymity and, and they’ll come out with ideas, they'll say things like oh… umm… oh, we just tell him that there's nothing to do with them or that guidance counsel was just checking up on your progress or those sort of things can be examples that they can use to reassure the people that, they’re not in any trouble. 

00:46:45
Mike. 

00:46:45
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:46:45
(inaudible ) that the teams agreed to that remains six months down track(ph) they, they'd never tell about this picture they had. 

00:46:55
MIKE WILLIAMS They, they often do, yeah they do, but it doesn’t matter because by that time the relationships have been transformed, yes. 

00:47:05
Still kids themselves are we at… at one of the strategies that still employs is undercover. 

00:47:10
MIKE WILLIAMS They do know about that, I’ve… in one year might have say six teams, well… can you, you know you can imagine how the impact that they will have on the school culture there's 6 teams, 6 kids it's 36 students that have all learned and they’re all practicing anti-bulling behaviors. Now, that is… you know, in a year and I didn’t take of 200 as a significant number of kids that also simultaneously influence many other people in the class of changing the sort of relationship that happen. Sometimes teachers just don’t realize that a class… when a class is not gelling, I don’t where the, you know you can relate to that, but there is just something that’s not right and as always because the relationships in the class are dysfunction or there is some problems there and they don't, they can't put the hand on, on it. 

00:47:55
(inaudible ) life is dysfunction. 

00:48:00
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah, yeah that could be umm… and that’s transferred into what’s happening in the classroom, yeah. And so the focus is really what’s going on in the class and why they do that, that’s sort of secondary to the effect that it is happening and the focus is on what they’re doing right now, what they need to change right now to make a difference. Here's is an example of the… of a plan now. I can show you this one, because we, we won't get up to that. It’s really simple, stick out for itself, tell her to ignore them and I asked who is, who on the team would like to do this. The whole team must gonna say yes, I’ll do that. umm… tell those mocking(ph) had to stop and the whole team make it feel welcome others will follow. These, these are, these are thing that the young people have said not me. These are suggestion of they’ve come up with. Start conversations with her, just talk to her… isn’t that so simple. But so profound as well these the, the people that are being bully they’re completely isolated. Nobody wants to know them and so when people that normally wouldn’t talk to them, start taking to them umm… they’ve they, they really do change and when the monitoring process goes on, one of the comments that has come back is that, we didn’t realized that she was a nice person. Or we didn’t realized that he was okay. Because they’ve got, you know, you put a wall up don't you, you put, you protect yourself from, from a text by isolating ourselves at times and excluding ourselves in conversations and from meetings, because we don’t want to be hurt any more. So they will do that. 

00:49:45
[sil.] 

00:49:50
Monitoring •Dominant story line of bullying dislodged and subverted through the actions of the UT •New story line is grown throughout the life of the Undercover Teams and documented through this monitoring process 

00:49:55
MIKE WILLIAMS And this is the monitoring process umm… it's really important to keep a track and a record of everything that is being done, so that it’s… we are able to refer to it at some other stage. And as the monitoring team… as the monitoring develops, a whole new story is developed, a whole new story line is created that wasn't day before of support and encouragement for the person that's being bullied. 

00:50:20
Day 5: Checking in with the Victim A chance to check that • The support group is sticking to the plan • The victim is open to the group's efforts • Feedback from support team • The victim is maintaining secrecy • Check also with teachers of any positive changes in class relationships 

00:50:20
MIKE WILLIAMS And then just checking in with the… the victim, and this is chance to find out whether from the victim's point of view, whether the team is sticking to the plan. And I was… I was explained the plan that the… bully that the undercover team has got, are sheer that was the victim of the bullying, so that they can know what the team is agreeing, what the team is doing. So this continual feedback information between the people that are doing the bullying and the… in the presence of victim. So another thing too that's important that I found was that a lot of the people that are being bullied, they are not really aware of… they are not open to people doing thing nice for them, people being supportive and people being encouraging to them, so they have got to… to get… they need to be opened up to their possibility that's something different will be happening. Umm… and that the victim is maintaining secrecy and then I'll check in with the teachers of any positive changes and I do this by asking the teachers ah… whether they have noticed any changes in the classroom and they feed back through to me through e-mail what they do. Sometimes teachers will take an active role as well. Once they know that a team is being sit up in the class and I… and I explain to them who is on the team and who the person that's being bullied us, they will make changes within the classroom as well, so they will seek people differently and they will change the seating, playing et cetera. And umm… I don't… they don’t until the students why that's students, that's part of unsettling the existing relationships and existing… existing dynamics, so that a new story can develop as a result of the disturbing all of existing patterns or behavior. So they… they will say become part of it. And teachers will say to me, oh, that person, she is so much happier and I will feed that back to the undercover team. The teachers have noticed the change in the classroom. The students are much happier. You see they will be getting on… on a whole lot better. 

00:52:20
[sil.] 

00:52:25
Definitional Ceremony • Future actions discussed • New storylines revised • Retelling of new story of transformed relationships by students • Planning for long term change • Principal's Certificates given out • Tuck-shop vouchers given out • Evaluation forms completed by UT 

00:52:30
MIKE WILLIAMS And the final sit, what Michael… what David Hipson(ph) has called a definitional ceremony, which is the rewriting of the story lines, future actions I discussed. The retelling of the story that have the relationships being transformed umm… this is what I talk about at the final… at the final certificate giving out. And umm… sometimes the victim likes to give out the certificates and this is a new twist for me. I didn't… this is… this is just kind of about team number 25, the person that bullies said, can I give out the certificates, and I, I thought well this doesn't fit in with my plans, because I've never had any communication between the person that's being bullied and the team, so I said, why not? So that person there, she gave out the certificates to her team members as a way of saying her appreciation. And what I have also done is included… invited the teachers along to the definitional ceremony and sometimes I have invited the principal as well, so what we do in creating this whole range of people that now see that the young people that had previously been bullying, plus also ones that had leadership and the qualities of anti-bullying were being ah… umm… recognized and rewarded, yeah. 

00:53:40
Well, I'm just a little bit confused to which to focus(ph) just before right away the umm… the five point plan… 

00:53:45
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:53:45
…was about and I had to list the names of students… 

00:53:50
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:53:50
…here undercover team… 

00:53:50
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:53:50
…they had actions that we are gonna do for example like tell the person to stand up for himself or whatever… 

00:53:55
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:53:55
It may go up to the victim and say stand up for yourself? 

00:54:00
MIKE WILLIAMS Well, that's part of the plan, yeah. That's what they agreed to do. 

00:54:00
Right. 

00:54:05
MIKE WILLIAMS So the plan is… is an… is a… is a sort of an example of the kinds of things that they would do to support that victim. 

00:54:10
So that's the point I wish the communications happening between the team and the victim. 

00:54:15
MIKE WILLIAMS That's right, and it usually starts straight away too. Once these students have got a mission, once they have got a task, they… they get on to with the very next day. And umm… one case where this boy was calling this… she was another South African girl, he was calling her some pretty cruel racial names. She was terrified of him. And the next day, the, the victim and her friend was standing in the playground. This boy comes up to her from around the… behind this boarding, well she freaked. She was terrified, and she thought what's he gonna do and he came up to her and he pulled her a bar of chocolate and he sit to a… there was nobody around, just the girl and this boy and the friend and he said just sort of gave her the chocolate and he said I am sorry and everything changed just in that incident and now they are the best friends. But up until this time, he was being very-very vicious to her. So that wasn't part of the plan, but this was an initiative that he took which is just what you are talking about. How they make the changes that they think umm… are required rather than the school authorities telling them what they should do, apologize to that person. My dad used to say, you know, that if a man convinced against as well as of the same opinion still, so I… I thought that if that's the case then I can't require them to do anything. The, the power of the team will make opportunities for them to… to do it for themselves, which is far longer lasting than if I told anybody what to do. So the team that comes around expects, yeah… 

00:55:55
Umm… is there track said the victim was sort of being little rude or a celebration sort, because it was quite right for them to go to this first (inaudible ) as well. And they hope (inaudible ) as well? 

00:56:08
MIKE WILLIAMS I think the biggest reward for them is that the bullying has gone. Yeah. 

00:56:10
That I'm used to (inaudible ) 

00:56:15
MIKE WILLIAMS I haven't thought about that yet, but this is like… this is… this is the work in progress and maybe I can consider some way doing that, but really for them, just the elimination to bullying and there are different relationships in the class. 

00:56:25
So they had completing down the track would be found hardest and I would have a change of family. 

00:56:30
MIKE WILLIAMS And they do, they certainly do, yeah, and they… they become powerful undercover team members for other people, so that… that has definitely happened. 

00:56:40
Due to change agents sort of things, celebration… and that they have actually been a change agent by just seeming and coming and talking? 

00:56:50
MIKE WILLIAMS They have been very powerful in that, yeah. 

00:56:50
Mike, you said that this wouldn’t be the ah… this isn't always there to, to use some… sometimes you to do so. 

00:57:00
MIKE WILLIAMS No. 

00:57:00
What you originally (inaudible )… 

00:57:05
MIKE WILLIAMS One of the red flags as when t hose occurring across labels, you know, from like older students bullying a student. The, the most… the most powerful way that this works in a… within a classroom with the bullying that's happening within the classroom, because that’s the side of the relational… relational aggression, yeah. So that’s, that's one of the things, yeah, yeah… ah… yeah. 

00:57:30
I'm wondering what if happened in… in the classroom and say for example it happened in turn one, and we've been thankful and you've put together an undercover team and they need to persuade we had a different victim, with different bit of trace so you would have… 

00:57:50
MIKE WILLIAMS Another team. 

00:57:50
…but it maybe some of the same thing (inaudible ) would you make sure perhaps that they were completely different. 

00:57:56
MIKE WILLIAMS No… 

00:57:56
Of the four, you know of the four I don't know what buddies… 

00:58:00
MIKE WILLIAMS Agents. 

00:58:05
Agents. 

00:58:05
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah, yeah… they know… I wouldn't necessary… it's sometimes it's different and in one case, where there was a, a set of the same team in the same class in the second part of the year, it was different members, but two of those members were on the second team. 

00:58:15
The child that chases to (inaudible ). 

00:58:21
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah, but not just the child, it's also the teachers as well had some input, because they know, excuse me, the students… students often better than what the students know themselves. So they might think… they might say to me if you thought about this person, this person I think would be really good, say, they… they've got their relationship with that student that they can suggest to. 

00:58:40
So when you say you take the six children out of not out of a core class? Does that mean that some of the meeting there on to six people there? 

00:58:50
MIKE WILLIAMS Umm… they have to be all… all present. They have got to be altogether at the same time. 

00:58:55
…to be a morning tea or at lunch time. 

00:58:55
MIKE WILLIAMS Well, more at lunch time, yeah, and if you provide some food too, they will come at lunch time… you know yeah so foods are also really important to New Zealand too, yeah. Umm… so we give… 

00:59:15
[sil.] 

00:59:20
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah, that's an example of the monitoring. This is my school that I keep. This is, this is just what's happened with the story that we may get around to. The team met for the first time. The bully admitted it was him. You know this didn't, this doesn’t usually happen, but in this case the bully that admitted it was him. But there is a lot of male plastering going and these are just my thoughts. I am writing my thoughts down. Umm… they said they had a repetition to maintain. This boy said, well, I got a repetition to maintain you know, I can't just be nice to this person. You know, I'm a boy, I'm a man, I have got to and so as they spoke, they realized just how stupid, you know what a stupid thing they were saying as they were hearing the… hearing what they were saying and the other kids look at them as if there is something strange about that. Umm… but I asked them how they keep it a secret ah… and that so they see into the first stage, I didn’t written, written much, but this is what I put about the first team. Then I got the, the second part is the, is the girl. They’re been kind to me now, a lot kind. They come up to me and say hi, they stick up for me. When people joke around in a bullying way they haven’t bullied anyone else, they’re starting not to go back to the bad self. I’m much happier, happier that, happier that I, happier that I don’t have to be teased. I’m not embarrassed anymore, because they don’t tease me, they have stuck up for me. Sometimes they'd tell me to ignore bullying and sometimes they start conversations with me. The classroom atmosphere is better, teacher have noticed that boys have gone good, especially Jamison. He has gone good, they hardly be naughty to the teacher now, I would like to meet them and thank them. This is her words; I never ask them, these are her own words. So that was the meeting of the, first meeting of the victim after the team had been set up. The second then and then the next team, it’s definitely good now, because we stopped, we’ve been greeting him more and talking. The class has changed, everyone is more civilized and they're socialized more. She laughs and smiles, she is happy now. This is their own words, so it sounds like the team has done their work. They now called the undercover team together. Umm… watch this girl, she gave at the certificates and the vouchers. They’re all happy now, she thanked us, she thanked the undercover team for helping her get rid of bullying. Get rid of her bullying that was an interesting way of putting it. But she was thankful, you know this particular girl umm… as a result of this undercover team, she came to me just before the end of the holidays, just before the end of term and she was covered in braces and umm… she'd been getting a really thrashing from her father. And I don’t think she would have come to see me had not she'd been exposed to a caring compassionate person that was able to help her. And as a results of that, it was a police action, because she was umm… over 16. And, and she, she put her hand up and she said this is just got to stop, I can’t take this anymore. So there were some pretty powerful things happened for this girl. Not only had the bullying gone on the class, but there been some major changes in her family life too and the parent umm… pleaded guilty he admitted that , which saved her so much you know anguish as a result. So, you know this is just one example of something that has been wired, something had happened and something else followed on from that, just what you’re talking about, about how they can come back and get help, yeah.

01:03:00
MIKE WILLIAMS And so, umm… these are, these are… these three article that umm… Dr. Winslade and I have written. And so this work has, is being published and it’s quite, umm… quite new. So this what I’m still at times uncertain and unsure, because I’m developing it, it's… it's because of the work in progress. Any more questions before we get to Elahi(ph) to be umm… my first, she is going to be the, is that’s okay with you Elahi, I would love you to, to be the girl? 

01:03:35
ELAHI Oh sure. 

01:03:35
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah. 

01:03:35
Yeah. 

01:03:40
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah and then you can be the part of the team too, but we’ll, we’ll come to that, yeah. 

01:03:40
I just want to ask one question. 

01:03:45
MIKE WILLIAMS Sure. 

01:03:45
So you had the Pasifika students who were bullying and their parents find out umm… because you got to remember kids tell their families that some children were bullies and that. So, say they come and approach you or they ruined(ph) the school book. What would you say to them? 

01:04:05
MIKE WILLIAMS To the parents? 

01:04:05
Yeah. 

01:04:05
MIKE WILLIAMS Often the parents want the kid that's bullied, don’t want that kids hung up and strung out and you know this is what they want, the parents want. And so, I’ll say to the parents, umm… can we give this a try. This is something that involves the whole of the class community and everybody needs to be included in the way that that the bullying has got to be eliminated and if they do that I am pretty sure that your son or your daughter will, you know things will happen quiet quickly for them. Because they’re not be blamed a lot and because they’re not being exposed the, the potential for retaliation and retribution on that person for speaking up that’s, that’s not there and most parents will say yeah, you know I’m happy for to give it a try, yeah. 

01:04:50
And also, ah… you said positive changes in the classroom. What would be one possible change for say Pasifika students, ah… say like anything to do with the treatment, umm… that you would look at that assisting that sort of the possible changes. 

01:05:10
MIKE WILLIAMS I haven’t done that, that the label of evaluation yet. But the teachers report that the classes are happier places to work, happier places… the classroom is a happier environment. And we know that when kids are happy and they are learning they are much more likely to learn. You know… I found that when a person is being bullied they shut down. And they really, they think about the possibility of when the bullying is going to occur next. And so they, they don’t focus or they don’t concentrate on their school, because they’re always worrying about what’s gonna happen to them either their next period when the bullying might be happening in that particular period or that was happening in, in their particular class. One girl, umm… one Pasifika girl, there's other girl who was really, really hated her and wrote a poem umm… that was pretty disgusting, it was pretty pornographic really. And umm… she, she read this poem out when the teacher's back was turned to all of the kids in the class and see that, that Pasifika girl had written this poem. And of course, this was just the most humiliating and shaming thing for that girl. So they can think up some pretty umm… cruel ways of hurting each other far beyond what I could imagine. They can dream up some pretty vicious things so, umm… yeah, they do shut down. And to me the undercover team it's not so much about how particular cultures will respond. umm… it’s, it’s, it’s the worst bullying destroys persons with their (inaudible ) Pasifika whatever umm… it’s the destructive element of the way that relationships have been hurting that person. So that all kids respond well to having a team, specifically sit up in a class devoted to helping them feel good about themselves. Who can, who could resist that? yeah. 

01:07:15
Just looking at the third… is that, is that book because I it's the (inaudible ) publishing company? 

01:07:22
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah, it’s a publishing company, yeah it’s an American umm… journal, yeah. 

01:07:25
So It's that a journal? 

01:07:30
MIKE WILLIAMS It’s a journal, yeah the second one is that, is that, as the (inaudible ) so if you go under that you’ll be able to get a copy of the article that, umm… has been produced. The first one is the, is a journal of systemic therapies, it’s not one that we familiar with the New Zealand, but it’s an American journal that, umm… is focused particular on this systemic approach to, to work in yeah. I’ve also mentioned to that umm… Dr. Winslade and I in the process of writing a book as well, yeah and so this, the undercover teams are part of, of… will be one of the chapters in the book. And the rest of the book is divided to umm… handling conflict in high schools. And so we’ve would be exploring a whole raft of different ways of, of, of dealing with conflict in schools from using with start of justice, list out of conferencing to using circles to using narrative mediation process, you know lot’s of this and they umm… the next umm… edition of the New Zealand journal, the New Zealand counseling journal will be an article by Dr. Winslade and, and I about narrative mediation using example of a fight that happened in my school and how we’re able to use narrative mediation to, to totally change the relationships that have, that were developed in the, in the school. So it's part of a… this is only part of a whole raft of approaches that we’re using to change the way conflict umm… as viewed and as dealt with in schools, yeah. 

01:08:55
Ah… oh I'm sorry. 

01:09:00
Thank you. Mike I was wondering how much of that needs to be adapted for to be more applicable to progress the children. I work with children 10, 11, 12 we undertake (inaudible ) where I work in the (inaudible ). 

01:09:20
MIKE WILLIAMS Hmm… 

01:09:20
So they’re 10 year olds, 10, 11, and 12. And then I cross the road and go to the hospital, so a lot of the bullying is already there because they, they, they're coming in from failure(ph) schools and so it is that they've already built the little groups happening and then I spend the next three years sorting everybody out, then I got the high school so we had half of the grade A kids come from the progress(ph) and the other half (inaudible ) comes from inside and the counselor been excellent in the (inaudible ) what do I do and I can say these could work out of the whole school if we work together with student, but I think maybe there because it may used to be just needed to be… the thinking that may be needs to be traced a little bit for the younger children. And they are apish before when I go to high school. 

01:10:15
MIKE WILLIAMS Ah… the… from in my discussion with primary school teachers that are using this, the biggest challenge that primary teachers face is how to keep the… the anonymity of the students, you know, because in a high school, the… the… the changing… the… the classes are changing. So every hour you've got a different teacher. So it’s much easier to maintain the sense of some intrigue and… and playfulness and… and… and undercover aspects of the group. But primary school teachers have said that they have used this, they have got the kids together play it on the interval, and so they have figured out ways of preserving that ah… anonymity of the… of the team. So each… each school does it differently. In a high school, it’s much easier, because you have either got a… either the bullying is happening in an option class, in which time, in which case you take the kids out of their cool classes or it’s happening in a cool class, you take them out of their option classes, or you make them at interval and lunch time or after school or before school yeah. 

01:11:20
Yes, just gonna ask you umm… do you see one of your procedures today ah… I really like, is cross transfer like for instance would (inaudible ) do you see this as a possible outcome? 

01:11:40
MIKE WILLIAMS I think you would have to… a lot of people have talked to me about this. In fact, I was invited to the Waikeria Prison to… because I like the idea of undercover… undercover teams, I was in the… the group. And so I… I… I just presented this work to the team and said to the people on the prison, can you think of ways that you could make it work and that’s what they were working on. So I think that the concepts of… of reframing and transforming relationships that can occur anywhere, I think… 01:12:15]I think it will just take some of the creator to… to think of how this could work in the workforce. In my review of a massive thesis of this… of this colleague that was doing, he was studying bullying in the nursing profession. She found that, in many cases, bullying was rewarded and that the person that was doing the bullying was… you know, there were sort of a tough customer and they are on the way up and they can get rid of all the dead wood and you know they were celebrated, and invariably the people that were bullying they just left, because it was… it was almost condemned and, and structurally and systemically supported by the workplace environment, yeah. So I’m… I’m not sure it would take somebody to think… it will… maybe I can make this work. This part could work and adapted to the workforce. 

01:13:10
(inaudible ) program if children reacting just slow (inaudible ) and part of the team in the (inaudible ) process wouldn't will move here around so therefore they're in the lookout for the same intention (inaudible ) simply in a small (inaudible ) we remember this might not be surprise, but if you see that may not be… 

01:13:30
MIKE WILLIAMS Well, it’s a bit hard to distinguish whether the person’s on… whether the person is being good, because on an undercover team were just being good anyway. So I think… 

01:13:40
They were also an undercover team last month, so? 

01:13:45
MIKE WILLIAMS Then I doubt I don't think it matters. One school in America, the… the… the principal was so wrecked about this idea that he, at the end of the year, at the certificate… in a prize giving certificates, he awarded all the people that were on undercover teams certificates, because he thought that they were making such a profound impact on the culture of the school that he thought everybody on the undercover team should be… should be celebrated at the final prize giving at the end of year prize giving well. That’s another approach that I hadn’t thought of too. Yeah. 

01:14:20
…I would be in the private school, so we have a very-very strong house system, you know it in. 

01:14:25
MIKE WILLIAMS Umm… 

01:14:30
And so the children can do points for their house whether it’s through sporting activities being on the chess team academic and I could see that this could be used that would be a very good incentive, because it’s a very strong culture that has culture system in the main progress. I don’t know that anywhere else that (inaudible ) anywhere else, but in place that in Brisbane I was educating in a progress (inaudible ) system and now I’m working in the same kind of environment and it’s very strong and very powerful and I would say that even more so than the certificates from the principal would be toys for their house so that their house would be saying as (inaudible ) you're free or someway everything else (inaudible ) down in the (inaudible ). 

01:15:25
MIKE WILLIAMS Well, I think that’s great. And for many people, especially people that have found being bullying for quite a long time, they’ve never had a principal certificate. So for the first time, they have got a certificate that’s rewarding positive behavior, they, they hang on to these not just a piece of paper that I have done on a photo shop, you know, it’s not a big deal, but for them, it is a recognition that they… that there is an aspect to their lives that nobody has seen and that's what? That’s the counter-story. That’s the alternative story that is not being talked about and so undercover teams provide an opportunity for that kind of story to be… to be celebrated and they do… they do that, yeah. 

01:16:00
I just quote my god that the issue of it working in a place like my kid has present where they have them and us, you know the authority is versus the inmates. 

01:16:15
MIKE WILLIAMS Umm… 

01:16:20
…which is not in most and (inaudible ) to us of course, so… 

01:16:22
MIKE WILLIAMS Umm… 

01:16:22
Here… here is an incidents like that in high schools, but I'm just wondering how that would possibly work and I was thinking perhaps if they come up with ideas you might have to put me in your book… 

01:16:35
MIKE WILLIAMS Maybe. 

01:16:35
…I'm talking about because that is… that seems to be you know quite a shattering team to adapt a… the… the meditation and, and calm, peacefulness approach. 

01:16:45
MIKE WILLIAMS Umm… 

01:16:50
And then that’s actually… because only sort of that team working with the other team and they brought a change or something they like it. I was just thinking on those lines you know… 

01:16:55
MIKE WILLIAMS Hmm… Hmm.. 

01:16:55
…what you… what… at this kind of approach offers in terms of social justice. 

01:17:00
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah. Well, it’s… it’s up to… I think the people would need to think creatively and think how could they make it work using the principles that I’ve talked about. I am happy for anybody to contact me at any time and I will send you the paperwork that I have got and that coach you through the process if… if you would like to try it in your school, I think that’s probably the best way to… to do it, to try it. It doesn’t matter if you don’t get it, right. The best I… I just started with the idea and… and it’s… and it’s developed and it’s grown and it doesn’t… it’s not about me, because the expertise lies on the young people themselves, it's up to them to make the changes and all you do is facilitate the kind of conversations that… that produce these kinds of positive… positive hopes for people. Yeah. 

01:17:45
Have you noticed in your experience with the groups that you have worked with, is it normal at the beginning for the bullies in particular if they're somewhat resentful towards, a victim for going forward and speaking about it and therefore, they nominated to be in the something on the team like is that normal at the start. 

01:18:10
[sil.] 

01:18:15
MIKE WILLIAMS They… the people that are being bullied will say why was I chosen for this team, and my response is that you are the experts, all of you here are experts on… on bullying. You know more about it than any teacher does, so all being recruited for a specific task to do that, and they will soften, they will… they will just change, because they will think that they are invited into a… into a positive approach that had previously have not been available to them. And I'll… I operate on the premise that most people like doing good things to people rather than doing hurtful things to people. That’s what I believe. And I think that by presenting that to young people, it gives them an opportunity to, yes, I can do good things, I don’t need to be this sort of, you know, this person that… that walks around the school as if I am a queen bee or a king bee, I can do positive things for people. So that’s how… that’s what I… that’s what I think happens. It’s stepping into the… the goodness of people if you like the opportunity to… to make positive changes in an environment that… that makes the difference for their learning, for them to do good. And this is reflected in their valuation… it's in the evaluation. In… in every case, umm… the question is, if you… if you are invited to be on another undercover team, would you like to? Everyone says, yes, I would like to. Not one single student on this, these… hundred of these evaluation forms, umm… as a person that I wouldn’t wanna do this again, I didn’t like it. The thing that the most people find the most difficult about it is keeping it a secret. That’s the hardest thing, but that’s… that’s one of the important things. I do guess it doesn’t really matter. Umm… I have spoken to 01:20:05]Maines(ph) and Robinson, people in England and they… they have developed what they call it the no blame approach and he didn’t like the idea of about being an undercover team, because he thought it’s better for them to be over rather than coward, but I think the… the coward has the aspects of it, make it a lot of fun. One team, they even got each other names, secret names and they had secret handshakes and you know always little quickie things that they were doing to kind of make themselves into this team, agent Lenten was one guy, and it seemed they had all these different… different team names and different signs that they would do, when they were something good that… you know that… they would contact each other. And so this… and the… and the… the people were doing, the bullying were included in this team that was, only a couple of days ago, they… they were trying to make this girl’s life as miserable as they possibly could. Here they are, overnight, trying to make this person feel good about themselves and about the classroom being a happier place and it’s contagious too, and I think that once the… once the plans are starting, once the five-point plan starts to be developed, this is… this is often a great sense of excitement and enthusiasm about, yeah, we can do, this just looks great, can we get started right now? How long do we have to wait? And so it quickly shifts them into a positive mode. 

01:21:20
A I got a question it sound quite similar is the term undercover, absolutely necessary, and I ask that, because in respect where are you? We have (inaudible ) And because our working can be in boys school and (inaudible ) and I'd personally thought to try and find a different word, a different I mean because boys are boys it doesn’t matter whether you are working in prison or whether where you are working in boys school if I know the basic group of this (inaudible ) running with undercover we're on them. The kids will be right on it. 

01:22:10
MIKE WILLIAMS I don’t know. I would probably just yeah 

01:22:15
So I am just wondering it will be precious about whether or not… if we adopt this into a system, would you be (inaudible ). 

01:22:25
MIKE WILLIAMS (inaudible ) this is my colleague at the front here. We talked about being so much to restorative approach, you know, because it is restoring the damage relationships in the class. So maybe you could call…,yeah, it restorative teams I guess you could call them that, yeah. But to me, the idea of being undercover and it’s… that is if boys think that is part of an underwear you know bras, knickers or something like that they might think of this in school and they might get quite excited about it you know. 

01:22:55
(inaudible ) I'm with a question… 

01:23:00
MIKE WILLIAMS Yeah. 

01:23:05
So you know to keep it within and being letting in (inaudible ). 

01:23:15
MIKE WILLIAMS Okay. I will just finish now, but I was gonna see if you could do it. But anyway this was… this was the… this is what we were going to do. I was gonna get a colleague to come up and just talk about what happened and this is… this is the true story and it happens in nearly every class. He thinks it’s a joke and sometimes I take these jokes. Sometimes it makes me sad and angry. It’s only started this year and I first took it as a joke, then he started to be more mean like he teases me, like he says I am ugly and I’m fat. He calls me names like corned beefy and I take that to mean that I look like corned beef. Sometimes the other girls laugh and he mocks my family like he says that my sister, she has got scabby legs and he mocks my friends. He says that I have got a big forehead. Sometimes he’s kind and most of the time he’s not. A couple of months later, he is mean again. He makes fun of my height. Sometimes he says it out of nowhere. He starts teasing me when I have done nothing. Can you… can you feel the pain in that girl’s story? And writing it down and recording it is really a powerful… it’s powerful for her. How does that make you feel? It makes me feel upset and angry, and I wanna hurt him back and say stuff back. I have tried this and sometimes he says sorry, but then he goes back to being mean. Sometimes it’s a big problem, because sometimes nearly all the boys join in and link on and I am embarrassed and shy because of the way they are teasing me. I don’t think it’s fair, because I don’t deserve to be treated like this. See there is a shift starting here. Now all his friends are getting in on it like it makes me think it’s true what he says. However she doesn’t come to school, but he always does. I don’t really belong to the school. I cry high(ph) and my day asks me what’s wrong, I'd just say nothing. I hate myself most of the time because of this bullying. I really hate it. I can’t learn my study here. This is the bill. Ideally, how would you like things to be? I just want him to stop teasing me and say some nice things to me. I would make me feel… it would make me feel like I fit in to be part of this class. I'm getting sick of the bullying. Sometimes I punch ‘em and then makes it better sort of, but then it comes back and it still carries on. So this work is a testimony to every student that has written a story like that and the counter-story that has developed where you saw what happened after the teammate worked in that girl, she was the one that gave out the certificates and thanked the team for what they had done. Thank you very much.
