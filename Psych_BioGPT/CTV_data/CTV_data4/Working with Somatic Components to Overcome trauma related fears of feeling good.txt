JANINA FISHER The client we're gonna talk about today and with whom you're gonna see me working uh… I'm gonna call M and M is a woman in her early 40s who has a history of childhood trauma, has done really wonderful work with a long time therapist overcoming issues of addiction, self-destructive behavior uh… difficulty stabilizing her life as we know happens to many, many trauma survivors. And she's here for a consultation umm… because there are some remaining pieces. She says, I've done most of the work, …she said, she says, umm… there are these pieces, we'll hear her, her exact words for it. Persistent, I think is one of the word she uses. There are persistent pieces of trauma residue I'd like to call them that continue to complicate her life. The most, the ones she's come here today to address has, is the difficulty in expressive, expressing positive feelings, difficulty in both feeling anger and expressing it. And, and also as you will see uh… she continues to struggle with disassociative symptoms. I don't see signs that she has a diagnosable disassociative disorder but I certainly see signs and she talks about disassociating. So one thing I just want to underscore is we don't, I think as therapists get good training in the treatment of disassociation because it is such a controversial topic. But experts from around the world are in agreement of absolutely united about the role of disassociation in trauma. There is a whole literature on disassociating at the time of the event or just before it uh… lots and lots of studies that show disassociative symptoms umm… not in the sense of spacing out, going away as we call it umm… and also disassociated self-states umm… that are, that don't meet the criteria for a disassociative disorder but are clearly umm… clearly recognizable in the mind and body. So as I come into this session to consult with her about these remaining pieces that she would like to address, to have the full rich life and relationships that she would like to have uh… I'm thinking about her using the following model. Uh… this is the diagram from my psycho educational sub chart. That shows the kind of diagrammatic outline of the structural disassociation model which is a trauma treatment. It's not a disassociative disorders model. It's a trauma treatment model, very well known in Europe, much less known here but it is such a wonderful way of understanding traumatized clients especially clients like M. Umm… that is going to be very much in my mind, I'm going to be listening for signs that there, this model might explain some of what she's dealing with. The model says that under stress, under conditions of threat and danger the brain which is already split, we have to remember we're working with a brain that is split from the moment of birth into uthera, it has sections, it has a right hemisphere and a left hemisphere. It has some cortical areas below about here, it has the brain stem and cerebellum at the back of the brain which is like a whole different brain without words, very primitive uh… holding our instincts and vital functions. So the brain in this theory is believed to umm… to serve to capitalize on those different structures to allow splitting, to allow different structures to operate independently. There is a great deal of literature on the way in which the left brain and the right brain have two different personalities, it is fascinating to go back and read the split brain research for example. And here the description of how the left brain, only the left brain has words and it has a kind of unemotional logic say these neuroscientists. The right brain is all feeling and impulse as we know. Umm… the left brain say these researchers creates a story, creates a narrative to try to make sense of what the right brain is doing even though umm… the impulse, the action came solely from the right brain that the left brain was kind of out of it. And uh… and so this theory says, we capitalize on this right brain, left brain splitting such that under traumatic stress, the left brain umm… begins to be in charge of going on with normal life. The right brain side of the personality remains on guard ready for the next and the next and the next and the next trauma because as you know especially in children's lives, traumatic events don't, there are limited to one single incident generally. So the left brain operating independently may have little to no memory of what happened. The left brain represents the part of that individual that kept on going to school, kept on making her bed, kept on helping out with the chores, kept on helping with little younger siblings, or played sports or read incessantly and the right brain side again in models of disassociative disorder often the trauma related side of the personality is associative with traumatic event memory. In this theory, the right brain part of the personality holds the body and emotional memories and the animal defense responses that have to be at the ready because some thing else is bound to happen and, and then the theory goes on to say that as recurrent traumatic events occurs as trauma and neglect go hand in hand so that there is stress of different kinds, there is a tendency for more splitting to occur such that a self-state develops driven by the fight response. A self-state driven by the flight response. A, a self-state driven by fear and, and freezing and, and wanting to be invisible. A self-state associated with submission or death responses and last but not least at all, a self-state driven by the cry for help response which is the earliest way we have of signaling that we're in trouble. And so this template is, is in my mind as I talked to M about the issues that bring her here and in my mind in terms of an explanatory model. Now I have, I've been working on developing a treatment model which integrates structural disassociation and techniques from internal family systems, sensory motor psychotherapy and hypnotic ego state techniques. In, in the model that I'm going to be describing in my book that I'm writing called healing the fragmented selves of trauma survivors. Because this left brain going on with normal life self has access to the medial pre-frontal cortex uh… if you know, know other part of the brain, that's the one to know about. Because the medial pre-frontal cortex has, is associated with mindfulness meditation, it has the ability to hover above, to see in wide perspective, to be able, you know, think about how often our clients see with a very, very narrow lens. It's very important to have a part of the brain that can see past and present, child and grown up umm… you know dangerous people, averse triggering people, averses people that he or she feel safe with. So going on with normal life self much like Richard Schwartz (ph.) concept of self is becomes the healer for this inner community of, of fragmented selves of the client. So you're going to see in this session, although, I don't mention the model, I know that her therapist is just familiar with it. Uh… but I don't teach it to her as I sometimes do. Umm… but you'll see the ways in which I try to increase awareness of different parts as they show up in her life and, and how, and how even though, they represent symptoms of problems for which the client is seeking help, they are there because the intention of the behavior, they engage in was protection. And that's how I can, I can help to facilitate some internal empathy, self-forgiveness, self-compassion which my, my theory says, is really what healing is about. It's not about resolving events, it's about our relationship to ourselves. So what's, let's see with this very, very interesting and, and really wonderful client has to uh… share with us. So thank you for doing this and uh… and let's start because it, it always helps to, to sort of focus a consultation on the question or in this case questions that you're bringing. Umm… so that I make sure that I answer them and uh… and I gather, your therapist have been talking about, what's. 

00:13:35
M You have to speak up for me a little bit. 

00:13:40
JANINA FISHER Oh, I'm sorry, all right. Let's start with the questions that you brought today. 

00:13:50
M Okay. 

00:13:50
JANINA FISHER Okay. 

00:13:55
M Umm… so one uh… sorry umm… I feel like at this point, like the big, like if you imagine a shifter all the big pieces are, are separated out, right. So I'm, I'm, sober, it's not drinking and smoking and using drugs and those pieces are out and the big trauma pieces then I could look at those and those have been shifted out and now what's left is umm… is the smaller pieces but are more pervasive, so umm… things like uh… you know, things that are uh… making it difficult for me to be in a relationship with people like this, this question but I want to work with how, how can we work with umm… I have a really hard time uh… acknowledging good, good feelings like if something, if I like something or something feels good like I can experience it. But I have a really hard time vocalizing it. 

00:14:55
JANINA FISHER Right, right. So you can quietly inside yourself. 

00:15:00
M I can talk it. 

00:15:05
JANINA FISHER Okay, that feels good. But the, the prohibition is against saying it out loud. 

00:15:10
M Yeah. 

00:15:10
JANINA FISHER Yeah, yeah. 

00:15:15
M Yeah and you know, pretty intense like I, like can disassociate around trying to verbalize that. So I start to twitch and go away and like my vision gets tunneled. 

00:15:30
JANINA FISHER Right, so your body actually says, no way. 

00:15:30
M Yeah. 

00:15:30
JANINA FISHER No way jose. 

00:15:35
M Yeah. 

00:15:35
JANINA FISHER You are not going to talk about this. 

00:15:35
M Yeah. 

00:15:40
JANINA FISHER Now, I just want to notice with you that she's saying my, the problem I'm coming here today with is an inability to express positive emotions. Very, very common uh… trauma response and uh… and it's really speaks to how important it is as therapists that we be more interested in the legacy of trauma than in the events that created that legacy. And, and that's the perspective umm… from which I come and what I reassure her about is that the fear of positive feelings is very, very common and uh… and I, and I invite her to, to think about whether it was safe to have positive feelings when she was a kid. And uh… and she agrees that it wasn't because typically uh… positive feelings in the child successes, happiness, spontaneity, playfulness, seem to trigger abusive parents to rage punishment and sometimes destruction of the, whatever it is the child feels positively toward. So, so let's go on and let's see how we're gonna work with this. 

00:17:20
M Which also you can imagine makes it difficult to have a meaningful connections with people. 

00:17:30
JANINA FISHER Well, yeah, I guess as if, if they need to hear, it was really nice talking to you. 

00:17:35
M Right. 

00:17:40
JANINA FISHER Then, obviously. 

00:17:40
M Right, right. 

00:17:45
JANINA FISHER Yeah, so you can enjoy them but you can't let them know. Yes and that makes so much sense as a, as a trauma response doesn't it? You know, and in fact the beautiful thing is that your body allows you to enjoy those good moments. It just says, shut up about it. 

00:18:10
M Right. 

00:18:10
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:18:10
M Right. 

00:18:15
JANINA FISHER Do not say a word. Wow, interesting and what else gets in the way? 

00:18:25
M Umm… so related to that an extension of that is that with umm… so, so liking something or, or you know, good emotion or more of a construct in my mind right but when we, when we get to actual emotions like you know, especially anger is a, is a difficult one for me. Umm… I uh… I have a hard time even feeling that. 

00:18:50
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:18:50
M Right, so I can't, it's not that I, I feel it but I can't acknowledge it, it's like, I just can't access it and that's where I feel like the firefighters and managers come in and, and prevent that. 

00:19:05
JANINA FISHER Notice that as she talks about this phobia of positive feeling, there is a shoulder twitch and, and that seems to then segue way into uh… a, a discussion of another emotional fear which is the fear of anger. This twitch appears to be related to both. Each time we talk about the expression of positive feelings big reaction from the shoulder. Each time we talk about whether it's okay or not okay to express anger, big reaction from the shoulder and because I'm trained in sensory motor psychotherapy a body oriented talking therapy, I'm very much at home with the idea that parts of us can speak through the body and so I am starting to relate to that shoulder twitch as a part that carries the fight response that says uh… you are not feeling this. This is not okay. So let's see, so we now have three people in the room. We have M, we have me and we have the angry, the fight part, the angry fight part or the protective fight part in her shoulder. Uh… so let's see what happens next? And, and do you know that you're angry even though you can't feel it? 

00:20:45
M Umm…, that's an interesting question. I guess, I do on a level, like I start to go there but I jump from it really, really quickly. 

00:20:55
JANINA FISHER And you start to go there meaning, you start to say something or you start to feel something? 

00:21:05
M Yeah, yeah. 

00:21:10
JANINA FISHER And how can you tell when you're angry? What, what tells you? 

00:21:15
M More, honestly more because things start like I start to twitch or I start to go away or there is, there is those cues that umm… that I then pay attention to. 

00:21:25
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:21:25
M Take me away from what, what was starting to happen. 

00:21:30
JANINA FISHER Wow. And of course, it makes sense because anger is such a dangerous emotion for kids to express, right, unless they have very, very safe parents umm… and your shoulder says I don't like this topic, let's chill with that topic. 

00:21:50
M It's so frustrating because I'm like, yeah, let's talk about this, get through it and my shoulder is going no. 

00:22:00
JANINA FISHER I'm wondering umm… have you ever asked your shoulder what it's worried about, if we just talk about, really we're talking about talking about anger, we're not really… 

00:22:15
M I know. 

00:22:15
JANINA FISHER Talking about anger. 

00:22:20
M Yeah. I have, I have. I've, I umm… I had some really informative information come out of just sitting with that and, and saying whatever information you have for me, I'm okay with hearing and I can hold it and that's some really powerful shifts from doing that. 

00:22:40
JANINA FISHER Yeah, and what's your shoulder told you so far about the emotion of anger? 

00:22:45
M About the what? 

00:22:50
JANINA FISHER About anger as a… 

00:22:50
M I don't know, umm… I don't know. Ask me that in a different way. 

00:23:00
JANINA FISHER Okay. What's, what's your shoulder worried about if we even use the A word? I, I don't think your shoulder is liking the word. 

00:23:10
M Yeah, I don't think so really. 

00:23:10
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:23:15
M Yeah. What is it worried about? 

00:23:20
JANINA FISHER Just ask, yeah, just ask inside, what are you worried about if we talk about this? 

00:23:30
M Umm… 

00:23:35
JANINA FISHER Just notice whatever. Just notice whatever words or feelings come up. 

00:23:45
[sil.] 

00:23:50
M It's just, it's, it just does not want to talk about anger. 

00:23:55
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:23:55
M Because it will bring anger. 

00:24:00
JANINA FISHER Uh… huh, so the word is, if you talk about it, you'll start to feel it. 

00:24:05
M Yeah. 

00:24:05
JANINA FISHER Okay. Yeah does the shoulder agreeing with it? 

00:24:10
M Yeah. 

00:24:10
JANINA FISHER Yeah. Okay. So all right and umm… and what's the shoulder worried about if you start to feel it? What bad thing would happen? It's almost like that shoulder is saying, no, no. 

00:24:35
M Yeah. 

00:24:40
JANINA FISHER That's, that's the word that comes up for me when I see the shoulder engaged. Yeah, yeah. 

00:24:50
M Yeah. It gets uh… it gets forceful. 

00:24:55
JANINA FISHER Notice here that I start to ask her some questions that are drawn from sensory motor psychotherapy. In sensory motor psychotherapy we ask questions that begin to tell us more about what's happening in the body. So, so I ask umm… does that tension in your jaw uh… go down into your shoulder or I might ask when you feel the twitch, do you feel any tension in, in the arm and up here in the neck muscles because what I my hypothesis is that the shoulder twitch is a, is a part carrying the fight response. If that is so, then we're going to see the muscles relating to fight begin to engage or the client will be able to, to say oh, yeah, the tension, you know, it's in my jaw, it's in my neck, it's in my shoulder in fact, it goes all the way down into my arm. And in fact, this is what we see and that tells us more about this fight part of the shoulder. So let's go on. So, there is a lot of tension. Yeah. And does that tension go all the way down into your arm or is it just… 

00:26:30
M The shoulder blade umm… yeah, the arm, in my fist. 

00:26:40
JANINA FISHER Yeah, yeah. Yes. So, so there is whole arm engages. 

00:26:45
M Yeah. 

00:26:45
JANINA FISHER Yeah, yes so I think your shoulder might be feeling a little of the Ang, of the A word. What do you think? 

00:26:55
M Maybe, maybe. 

00:26:55
JANINA FISHER I mean, it's certainly, it, it looks ready to defend. Yeah. So that's telling me that maybe the shoulder is afraid, it's very dangerous. 

00:27:15
M The shoulder is very dangerous. 

00:27:15
JANINA FISHER That the shoulder is worried that it's very dangerous. And could you ask the shoulder if that's right? 

00:27:25
M If the shoulder is very dangerous? 

00:27:25
JANINA FISHER If the shoulder is worried. 

00:27:25
M Yeah. 

00:27:30
JANINA FISHER That the emotion of anger is very dangerous. 

00:27:30
M Okay. 

00:27:35
JANINA FISHER And you know, it's just thinking, it's this is about stopping something. It's about defending. 

00:27:45
[sil.] 

00:27:50
JANINA FISHER And ask your shoulder, is it dangerous to feel anger? 

00:28:00
[sil.] 

00:28:05
M Yeah. 

00:28:05
JANINA FISHER Yeah, okay, yeah, okay. So, so that's important that we know that. And I can imagine that there must have been a time in your life when it was. 

00:28:20
M Right. 

00:28:25
JANINA FISHER So, so your shoulder didn't just made this up. It's remembering a time when it was a bad idea, yeah, yeah, yeah. And uh… and I don't know this might be a kind of a too much big a question to ask but when you feel this, when the shoulder tenses your arm and shoulder and fist, does it feel like it's ready to defend or ready to stop you? 

00:29:10
M More protect. 

00:29:15
JANINA FISHER Okay. Yeah, yeah. So it's worried about what will happen as a result of your feeling the anger. 

00:29:20
M Yeah. 

00:29:25
JANINA FISHER Yeah. It just said, yeah. It's very. 

00:29:30
M It's very vocal. 

00:29:30
JANINA FISHER It's very articulate. 

00:29:30
M Trying to mean sometimes. 

00:29:35
JANINA FISHER Yeah, yeah, yes. Now, I'm going to talk with her some more about, about this role of the fight part umm… and you know, it's really quite wonderful, I think part of what I love about this theory is that when you're working with a theory in which, in which part carries a survival defense response and has been shaped by the events that occurred, but has those animal defense instincts that are inherent in the human body and mind umm… it's very, very important for the client to get that this angry fight part that won't let her, express anger, won't let her express pleasure, that, that part is trying to protect her from harm. The problem is that, it's harm then not harm now. Uh… so protective part sometimes I call them bodyguard parts, sometimes I, I talk about the fight part or the flight part. In this case, it's very easy that we talk about the shoulder twitch part and you'll see that I begin to encourage a dialogue between the client and this fight part because I know that it is going to be through that dialogue, through growing relationship between the left brain, normal life adult who has fought her way through addiction, through years of crisis and chaos to a stable point umm… has to create a relationship with this fight part umm… encoded in the right, I'm sorry, I got my, got my left and right confused. You know the fight part encoded in the right brain, the normal life part umm… right here and right here. And she has done enough therapy to be comfortable with the language of parts and to be comfortable when I say, well, ask the shoulder twitch part what is, what, what is this right, am I on the right track? Uh… she's able to, to just go with that umm… without saying, what, what, you want me to talk to myself uh… which sometimes clients do. At which point, I say, you know, the healthiest among us talk to themselves a lot. That's what we now know. So going on… And umm… just as an objective, I mean, I'm not asking your shoulder to agree with us but objectively speaking in the world you live in today, is there any danger to just feeling angry inside? 

00:33:00
[sil.] 

00:33:05
M In the world, I live in today? No. 

00:33:10
JANINA FISHER Yeah. And, and I understand you know when, when we are small, when we are children, it's dangerous to feel the feeling because kids suck at hiding their feelings. If you notice that. So, so in order to protect them, they can't feel it. And so that's your body is, is really like a poster child for, I can stop any feeling I perceive as dangerous. Yeah. 

00:33:45
M Yeah. 

00:33:50
JANINA FISHER Yeah, it does a good job for you. 

00:33:50
M It does. 

00:33:50
JANINA FISHER A little. 

00:33:55
M Exactly, exactly, it's not useful anymore. 

00:33:55
JANINA FISHER Right, right. So maybe the shoulder would like to, if we moved on for to question to we can come back to this but, the shoulder would like if we talked about it? 

00:34:10
M I think so. 

00:34:15
JANINA FISHER Okay. So, so the actually question. Umm… so what was the third question that you… 

00:34:20
M I don't know, if I had three. 

00:34:20
JANINA FISHER Okay. Just two. For some reason, I had the numbers three in my mind. Okay, so these are the big ones. Yeah, yeah. And so it's hard because anger, your body says is dangerous. Feel talking about positive feelings is dangerous. Are there any feelings that are safe? 

00:34:55
M I can get to sadness pretty easily now. Umm… 

00:35:00
JANINA FISHER Was there a time when that was difficult too? 

00:35:05
M Yeah. 

00:35:05
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:35:05
M Yeah, and excitement, I can be excited about things. 

00:35:10
JANINA FISHER Can you talk about it? 

00:35:10
M Yeah. 

00:35:10
JANINA FISHER Good, that's nice. 

00:35:15
M Yeah. That, that wasn't always the case either but. 

00:35:15
JANINA FISHER Yeah, yes, yeah. So there is this, I notice that there is a way that I'm working with her that I think might be of interest to you because we've talked about the impermissiblity of positive feelings. We've talked about the no, no of angry feelings. So I ask her what feelings are permissible. Because in every human being's childhood history there are some feelings that are safer to express and some feelings that are less safe to express. And, and so I want to know which parts of her and which emotions were permissible or which has she made permissible over the years which, what hasn't put up a uh… got in a big fight from the fight. So asking about what feelings are permissible and those kinds of questions also help clients to connect to their strengths. And most recently I have a very long term client, I've seen her three years now and she said to me, recently, she said, you know every therapist I've ever had except you, except me has been so fascinated by the glory details of what happened to me. Why don't they ask how did I survive it? That would be a question that would help me. Because each time they ask about the horrible details, it takes me back there and I lose touch with the strengths that helped me to survive. So, I'm asking questions not only that can at the, at the pieces still unresolved but also get at her strengths because it's her strengths that are gonna give us the, the momentum, gonna give us the resources, we need to heal and grow each part of us. And how, how were you able to help your body feel okay with excitement and sadness? 

00:37:55
M Umm… I think so, I think with excitement, it was, it was more, it was the shift came in understanding that physiologically fear kind of the same as excitement right and because before if I would feel that, then I would think it was fear and I couldn't, I couldn't stay with it but once I kind of understood that physiologically, it's the same thing, so it's, but I have to look at the external cues to go hey what is that, what am I assigning that to? Then I can umm… now I can acknowledge, okay, this is excitement about something. 

00:38:35
JANINA FISHER And you know, what's really wonderful about that is you're describing that when you say this is okay, this is just the same as anxiety or this is just the same as excitement. Umm… they are the same, 

00:38:55
M Right. 

00:38:55
JANINA FISHER That your body and your parts listen to you. 

00:39:00
M Right. Say the last part again. 

00:39:00
JANINA FISHER Your body and your parts listen to you. 

00:39:05
M Yeah. 

00:39:05
JANINA FISHER Because I know if we said to your shoulder 

00:39:10
[sil.] 

00:39:15
JANINA FISHER Umm… today it's okay to feel anger what would your shoulder say? 

00:39:20
[sil.] 

00:39:25
M It may go maybe. 

00:39:25
JANINA FISHER Okay. 

00:39:30
M Well, you know, willing to willing. 

00:39:30
JANINA FISHER Wonderful. That you know, that's a really, really important thing that you have parts and a body that trusts you enough to believe you or to consider believing you. Okay. Does considerably believing you work better for the shoulder? 

00:40:00
M Maybe. I just, no, I think, I think like they do, I do know how parts, I just was thinking that it wasn't always the case. That's a kind of a relatively new thing. 

00:40:10
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:40:10
M And how great. 

00:40:15
JANINA FISHER Absolutely. And, and it makes sense you've done a lot of work. You're in a, in a good place in your life as a result of all that work. 

00:40:25
M Yeah. 

00:40:25
JANINA FISHER And so you've, you've proved yourself apparently. 

00:40:30
M Yeah. 

00:40:35
JANINA FISHER And does that feel good? 

00:40:35
M Yeah. 

00:40:35
JANINA FISHER Yeah, yeah. Oh, sorry, so, it's okay, I forgot. I forgot. 

00:40:50
[sil.] 

00:40:55
JANINA FISHER I just want to say a little something about how much laughter you're seeing in this session. Umm… you know laughter has many, many, many clinical assets. It's, it's really, I mean again, I never force a laugh but letting laughter be a part of therapy serves another, a number of important functions. Umm… laughter regulates anxiety, anger, shame, hopelessness and helplessness. Oh, there is hardly an emotion that doesn't get regulated by laughter and also umm… and you may know this already, but laughter is associated with the release of endorphins and you know endorphins are, are happy chemicals. They relax the body, they have an analgesic effect, so if we're in pain, and we laugh, we get more of those chemicals that help to soothe the pain. So umm… so I'm, I'm, I mean, again I never force a laugh but I'm letting laughter happen because we're on, you know, we're on very important territory and there is a struggle between the left brain saying, I want a normal life in a normal life people express anger, they express that they've had a good time, they can say to a friend, wow that was really a wonderful time we had. That's what I want and the right brain fight part saying, no, no, that's dangerous. So let's go on. Let me, let me umm… ask you umm… again because the parts trust you and they just met me. Do you believe in this moment, in this room would there be anything dangerous about saying, yes, it feels good that my parts trust me? Just in this moment, not umm… can you think of anything that would be dangerous about that? Your shoulder is not comfortable with it. Ah-huh… uh… 

00:43:40
M That's the, that's the dichotomy right, I, I don't but my shoulder has a different opinion. 

00:43:45
JANINA FISHER Absolutely. So your shoulder is still carrying the, you know, still carrying the defenses, you had to have in a, in a dangerous world. So it's like the shoulder is saying, there is never a moment when it's okay to say that something is good. Yes, so ask the shoulder if I'm right? 

00:44:25
[sil.] 

00:44:30
JANINA FISHER And umm… and is the, is the shoulder worried about what is usually the biggest worry in verbalizing a positive feeling? 

00:44:45
M I don't know, if I understand? 

00:44:50
JANINA FISHER You know, it's very, very common to either have the fear of feelings something good and even bigger fear of saying, indicating that something is good. Because it is so common in the context of trauma and abuse for anything kids indicate is important to them to be taken away or made into something negative. And so there is, there is a whole piece of learning that takes place about either some people actually lose the capacity to enjoy things because then they can never give away that they do. And some people lose the capacity to, to communicate that something feels good or is important to them. Was that your experience that it wasn't a good idea to indicate that something was meaningful to you? 

00:46:05
M Yeah, yeah. Definitely. 

00:46:10
JANINA FISHER Yeah. A lot of the things that often therapists have questions about is the, is the role of psycho education in therapy. I was a student of Judith Herman (ph.) back in the early 90s that was, that was part of my training in trauma. Umm… and, and Judy was a very, very clear on that point. She believed that education was essential for traumatized clients because it fought, it challenged the felt sense of being helpless, of being lost, of not having, you know, not having a future. I can, when someone says, you know, there is no future for me, I can say, did you know that, that's actually a symptom of post traumatic stress? So that education helps both helps the normal life self to have more resources, it helps to challenge shame, so that clients don't shape themselves for having perfectly normal symptoms of trauma. And so the psycho education uh… to make all of these feel normal, so that the client feels empowered to address it is a very important component of the treatment. So you'll notice I'm interweaving psycho education throughout the session. Yeah, yes. So, so, you know, one thing your shoulder is worried, yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel for your shoulder. What kind of, how do you feel toward your shoulder? 

00:48:15
M Uh… I feel grateful to my shoulder most times, you know, it keeps me alert or keeps me umm… you know and actually I want to plow ahead and, and just push through it and umm… 2016 and I'm 43 years old and uh… my shoulder reminds me that. 

00:48:30
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:48:30
M You need to be gentle. You need to be slow. 

00:48:35
JANINA FISHER Uh… huh, so the shoulder is the patient with you. It does, the shoulder is not saying, no, never ever, ever. It's saying, too fast, too much. Don't go there. 

00:48:50
M Yeah, yeah. 

00:48:50
JANINA FISHER Wonderful and when you slow down and you say, okay. I won't plow through this one. Your shoulder relaxes. You and your shoulder have a great relationship. Oops, sorry, you don't have to agree with that. 

00:49:10
M You can say it. 

00:49:15
JANINA FISHER I can, okay, I can say it. That's right. There we go. Are you allowed to nod? 

00:49:20
M Maybe. 

00:49:20
JANINA FISHER Ask your shoulder, ask your shoulder. Your shoulder. 

00:49:25
M No. 

00:49:30
JANINA FISHER No. Okay. That's fine. Is the shoulder allowed to show that it's okay with something? 

00:49:40
[sil.] 

00:49:45
M Yeah. I don't know how it works, but yeah. It vary. 

00:49:55
JANINA FISHER Well, I suppose it could, it could relax a little, imagine umm…, it could, it doesn't, is the shoulder speaking words? No, okay. The reason, I ask is because umm… it is, it's very common for, for parts of our bodies to speak. You know, that it might sound strange. It's actually very common, if I ask, if I ask someone, you know, if, you know, if that tightness in your jaw had words, what would it say. It's very common for the jaw to speak. So that's why I asked. It is not uh…, it's not an impossible thing that some day your shoulder and you might be able to carry on a conversation. 

00:51:00
M Yeah. 

00:51:00
JANINA FISHER Would that be nice? 

00:51:00
M Yeah. 

00:51:05
JANINA FISHER That's great, so let the shoulder know, yeah. That would be good that you would like to talk to him. And umm… and certainly you're a free good listener to the shoulder. And it's a good talker. 

00:51:25
M Yeah. 

00:51:25
JANINA FISHER Are you allowed to say something positive about your shoulder? 

00:51:30
M Yeah. 

00:51:30
JANINA FISHER Okay, okay. Interesting. So your shoulder has more confidence that, that nothing bad will happen if you say something positive about it. That's good to know. 

00:52:00
[sil.] 

00:52:05
JANINA FISHER Interesting. Umm… so I have some ideas are percolating in my head. I think because, because of the fact that your parts do trust you umm… maybe not a 100% of the time but there is a willingness to listen to your point of view that I really think is remarkable. 

00:52:40
[sil.] 

00:52:45
JANINA FISHER And uh… so I'm thinking about how we could work with that. I can, I can see it make sense to you that these prohibitions are, are old defenses and umm… and how would you your parts know that your world is so different now. Especially because it wasn'ting always right. For how many years would you say your life has been safe and stable? 

00:53:25
[sil.] 

00:53:30
M Umm… I'd say about four on a, on a degree right. 

00:53:35
JANINA FISHER Absolutely. 

00:53:35
M Yeah. 

00:53:40
JANINA FISHER Yes. Absolutely. That's important. 

00:53:40
M Yeah. 

00:53:40
JANINA FISHER Because it isn't like we wake up one day. 

00:53:45
M Exactly. 

00:53:45
JANINA FISHER Yes, of course. 

00:53:45
M Exactly. 

00:53:45
JANINA FISHER You worked hard but that, in that working hard some thing was shifted. 

00:53:55
M Yeah, exactly. So starting about four years and within the last year, I'd say really, it has shifted. 

00:54:00
JANINA FISHER Yeah, yeah yes. So it does make sense that those parts haven't necessarily caught up with that news? 

00:54:10
M Right. Still pretty tentative. 

00:54:15
JANINA FISHER Is it tentative or they afraid, it's tentative? 

00:54:20
M No, it's tentative. 

00:54:20
JANINA FISHER Okay, okay. 

00:54:25
M It's tentative. 

00:54:25
JANINA FISHER You still have to work at it. 

00:54:25
M Yeah. I still have to, still have to go, yeah go slow and reassure them. I got this. 

00:54:35
JANINA FISHER Good, good. Yeah and do you, just do that throughout the day in a kind of natural way? 

00:54:45
M Yeah, I do. Yeah. 

00:54:45
JANINA FISHER As opposed to having a kind of dedicated. 

00:54:50
M Exactly, exactly. It's more throughout the day, things come up and I and I clock something like oh, you know, it just somebody just got angry with me and I could say, it just happened this week for the first time in a long time maybe ever, well someone got angry and I said, you know, wait a minute, not, it's, you know, not, it's not appropriate or basically some version of that like. 

00:55:20
JANINA FISHER Wow. 

00:55:25
M Yeah and uh… and then afterwards, I caught that like oh, okay, I just, I just protected myself against somebody's unnecessary uh… attack. 

00:55:35
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:55:35
M Yeah. 

00:55:35
JANINA FISHER Yeah. Beautiful. So you, you just set a boundary not in a confrontational. 

00:55:45
M No, not at all. 

00:55:45
JANINA FISHER Not adversial way. 

00:55:45
M Not at all. 

00:55:45
JANINA FISHER Just like. 

00:55:45
M I just said, you know, this is not uh… this is something she got angry with me, a week before and I said this time, I said, you know, I took, I took one for the team last time but this is not mine. This is not my responsibility. Umm… so. 

00:56:05
JANINA FISHER Beautiful boundary. 

00:56:05
M You know. 

00:56:05
JANINA FISHER Beautiful. 

00:56:05
M Thank you. 

00:56:10
JANINA FISHER Yeah, I took one for the team last time not this time. 

00:56:10
M Yeah. 

00:56:15
JANINA FISHER Yeah, yeah, yeah. And really and even made it about yourself. Umm… because that, that's so, you know, I always think that as soon as the other person says, you did this and we say, you did that, umm… that word you is like pouring kerosene on a fire. Yeah. Yeah, bravo. And one of the things I am kind of suggest because what you're really struggling with umm… is what one of my clients has named the trickle down effect and it comes from when we were talking one day, almost a very similar conversation. He was saying but you know, my life is stable, you know, I'm a respected adult, you know, I'm gainfully employed. I have, you know, nobody has harmed me in 20 years. Why are my parts not getting it? 

00:57:30
M Yeah. 

00:57:35
JANINA FISHER Right, like can't they see that this is a very different world and uh… and I said, well when was the last time you asked them to notice that uh… you were being respected at work umm… that you were being treated as somebody who deserves respect and he said, I don't tell them, I mean, they can see. But of course, what's the picture, the parts are looking at. They are looking at a very different picture. 

00:58:15
M Yeah. 

00:58:20
JANINA FISHER And uh… and so he said so, you mean, there is no trickle down effect. I said yes, so that's how we came up with the name. Uh… it's, it's really because the parts live in a different set of brain structures than, than your wise self. 

00:58:45
[sil.] 

00:58:50
JANINA FISHER And, and like the really the going on with normal life part that's fought so hard to stabilize your life. 

00:59:00
[sil.] 

00:59:05
JANINA FISHER So, so one of the things that I think could make a big difference especially because they already trust you. Umm… is to actually keep showing them how it's different. So if I, if I were living with your shoulder, I would keep showing the shoulder the image of your saying, no, took one for the time last time, not this time. And, and showing the shoulder, you know, did anything bad happened as a result of my saying, no. This is an issue that baffled me for many years and I know baffles many, many, many therapists. It has to do with the client's ability to remember or to integrate the growth and positive experiences he or she's had in all the years after trauma. Because there is a point that the trauma stops and I often will ask my clients, how many years ago was the last traumatic event you experienced? And they'll say, oh, you know 1978, 1985, umm… 1990 or even 1956 and, and so the, you know, all those years post trauma, they, they have been growing and learning but it often hasn't trickled down that information hasn't reached the parts, it hasn't reached the body, it may have stayed as an intellectual piece of information. So we could ask the client how have you grown in the last 20 years and the client can say, oh, I've grown in this way and that way. And so, I start to explain to her about how it is that all of the stability, all of the positive developments of her life have not been integrated by those trauma related parts. Uh… this one thing I don't mention in the video but I, I could have brought it up is that the body has a bias as Bruce Perry says, the brain's first priority is survival. Everything else matters very little compared to the importance of survival. So having a brain that stores new developments and new learning's here but allows the survival instincts of all human beings to remember intact and to continue to be evoked by the environment would make evolutionary sense, wouldn't then? And or even if you, if you happened to by accident say something positive, okay. Rather than thinking, oh no, I blew it. That might be a moment to say, everybody listen up, I just said something was good, is there anything bad happening here? So they can see for themselves, which I also think is, is powerful, don't you rather than, you know, I mean, I know that you have a wonderful relationship with your therapist but and you probably believe most things that she says, but, I think there is a difference when someone says, look at this information, what do you think. 

01:03:30
M Yeah. 

01:03:30
JANINA FISHER You know. 

01:03:30
M Yeah. 

01:03:35
JANINA FISHER And uh… so if, if it's worked for you to have information, it may work for parts. 

01:03:45
[sil.] 

01:03:50
JANINA FISHER And I'm also thinking that I sort of have, I have two recommendation, I mean, you've done so much work, it's, it's a wonderful thing, I don't have to, I don't have to give you a long list of recommendations. Umm… the other thing that I would recommend is working on establishing more inner communication because that's gonna help the trickle down effect. And it will help keep growing the trust and, and also I don't know, you know, there is, that something very reassuring about actually feeling your presence at this time in your life. I'm sure at one time. I'm sure, many times in your life, it wasn't so reassuring. But at this point in time, I would think your presence would be very reassuring to the parts. And, and your perspective. What does the shoulder think? Yeah, so what's the shoulder worrying about? 

01:05:20
M What's the shoulder worried about? 

01:05:20
JANINA FISHER Yes. 

01:05:20
M I don't know. 

01:05:25
[sil.] 

01:05:30
JANINA FISHER Ask. It's got a worry. It's got a little worry. Yes. You can feel it. Umm… is it, let's ask, we'll ask some, some yes, no questions, how about that? Ask the shoulder is it worried about your having more, more dialogue with the parts? 

01:06:05
[sil.] 

01:06:10
JANINA FISHER No, no, that, that was that okay? 

01:06:15
M Yeah. And then just things, some things I have been practicing recently, so it's, so it's good. 

01:06:20
JANINA FISHER Great, great. 

01:06:20
M Yeah. 

01:06:25
JANINA FISHER And uh… and that question, what are you worried about is such an important question because these are parts with many, many worries and, and it's, and worries many which you can actually reassure them that on your watch, it wouldn't be a worry. Yeah. So the shoulder is trying to tell something. 

01:06:55
M And I think, I, I so I think it doesn't, there is not enough evidence there yet that I'm, when you say on my watch or that… 

01:07:05
JANINA FISHER Okay. 

01:07:05
M I got this or whatever, there is just not enough evidence there but… 

01:07:10
JANINA FISHER Okay. All right. 

01:07:10
M It's not gonna be bad. 

01:07:15
JANINA FISHER So, so that's important. That's the shoulder, if you got that right. Okay. So, so that's, it sounds like that's a really, really important piece of this. 

01:07:40
[sil.] 

01:07:45
JANINA FISHER And, and it kind of reminds me about what you're saying about growing, about growing, you know, this hasn't been one day, I got safe and stable and it's all been a picnic. 

01:07:55
M Right. 

01:07:55
JANINA FISHER Okay, this has been a process and so maybe that's another piece of growing trust but remember the trickle down effect that means, I think, I could imagine umm… you know, a little bit like umm… like umm… you know, (inaudible ) program, like just imagine saying to the parts, I want you to notice that I'm sober and everything was safe today, you know, could we put a little mark on the calendar okay. Because I want you guys to see that this is not just you know, wrong. This is something that I'm working on and I'm determined. Cross your shoulder like that. 

01:09:00
M Yeah. 

01:09:05
JANINA FISHER Yeah. Umm… and I am deal this is, this is real life. Uh… this is real therapy. I'm sure, it's all happened to you guys as well as to me. We've had a very good session. It's felt, it's felt like we had a good flow that she was able to take some information and she was able to have this dialogue with her shoulder twitch part and then at the crucial moment, I forget, not for the first time but the second time in this session, I forget that she's not allowed to express positive feelings. And so, and I try to help her say something positive to the fight part, to the shoulder twitch part and, and, and she's triggered and disassociates and you'll see that, you know, I didn't, I didn't pick up well on it. I think if this has been a client I knew, I would have said, are you still there? What's just happened? That's what I would normally do. But in this instance, I'm trying to end the session with someone who's triggered, who's frontal cortex is offline and we're really going through the motions. Thank goodness what you don't see in the video is that her therapist was in the room and as soon as we ended, her therapist said, you're really triggered, aren't you? And helped her then to use some of her sensory motor psychotherapy uh… coping techniques which she's learnt, we call them somatic resources umm… feeling her freedom on ground, link to her spine, so her, the shoulders come up automatically. Umm… looking around the room and she gradually came back into the room, I was very glad. But it's really does go to show how in our, in our well meaning attempts, to bring a positive ending to a session that was all in all very positive, we can, we can forget umm… because we're in touch with our own agenda, we can forget some thing that the client has told us that would signal, don't go there, don't go there. Uh… so let's, let's go to the very, very end of this session. I'll tell you, that shoulder, it's like, your guru. Really. It's amazing, you know, that make so much sense. 

01:12:05
M It's a visual barometer. 

01:12:05
JANINA FISHER Yes. 

01:12:10
M What's going on. 

01:12:10
JANINA FISHER Right, well that's true and you can't miss it. 

01:12:10
M Yeah. 

01:12:15
JANINA FISHER Yeah. That's amazing. Well, you know, I was just the thought that came up for me was, you know, with that shoulder, you don't have to worry about backsliding because that shoulder would be like… 

01:12:35
M Yeah. Right. It's true. 

01:12:40
JANINA FISHER You, you don't have a choice here. Yeah. The shoulder is keeping you more than honest. 

01:12:50
[sil.] 

01:12:55
JANINA FISHER You want to thank it? Is that allowed, I should have asked. Ask the shoulder if it's okay to thank it? 

01:13:05
[sil.] 

01:13:20
JANINA FISHER What's it saying? What's it saying? No, don't thank it. 

01:13:30
M I guess not. 

01:13:30
JANINA FISHER Okay. All right. That's great. That's wonderful. Because, because it's so clear. And umm… maybe the reward your shoulder wants is, is your stability and safety. 

01:13:55
[sil.] 

01:14:10
JANINA FISHER Yeah. Does your shoulder thinks it's time for us to stop? What do you think? Yeah, yeah. So, so I think the shoulder is actually done a really good job of consulting to you. 

01:14:35
[sil.] 

01:14:40
JANINA FISHER And uh… and does it feel that there are any other questions that, that we should address before we stop? 

01:14:55
[sil.] 

01:15:00
JANINA FISHER Yeah. Okay, well, thank you very much. My thanks to your shoulder given though it doesn't want thanks to be frank umm… and uh… bravo for the incredible work you've done and uh… and I'll be interested to hear how the, how the trickle down project goes. 

01:15:30
[sil.] 

01:15:40
JANINA FISHER So like (inaudible ). 

01:15:41
M Okay. 

01:15:41
JANINA FISHER You know, despite having triggered her a good learning lesson for me umm… I really had a good feeling about the session, I was glad her therapist was there. Uh… who said it was very helpful to watch me work with the shoulder twitch uh… in a very different way than the therapist has known to do. And umm… and I think all in all it felt that others then, the fact that I kept forgetting that she has this prohibition of positive feelings. Umm… I think, I was able to take her another step and you know, in my world we believe that you build in small increments because if you help a client try to take a bigger leap forward and, and the client crashes, it's harder to recover. If you take a baby step and then you build on the baby step and you take another and you build on that baby step. The client begins to feel a sense that there are stairs under the feet, there is a foundation under the building and, and is able slowly early to take bigger steps, as long as they build on the last step. So it was a great, great pleasure to work with M and, and to facilitate this conversation that's beginning in her body between, between the normal life self of M and the fight part in that shoulder because until M convinces the fight part that the war is over, the fight part is going to continue to exercise its mission as body as protector of the danger that it is organized to umm… to defend against. So thank you very much for listening, uh… it was, it was a very, very pleasurable session for me and I hope you enjoyed meeting the shoulder twitch part.
