00:02:45
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD Thank you. Congratulations to our TC colleagues, and hosting 29 years of the round table. Doin' anything related to culture for a period of time is something to celebrate, but doin' it for 29 years definitely deserve to be congratulated, to be celebrated, so congratulations. And that you so much for the invitation to come and share with you a little bit about the work that I've been doing internationally, um, today. So, thank you, goo to see all of you. 

00:03:15
Presentation Overview Mental Health Needs in Low Income and Low Middle Income Countries Addressing the Mental Health Needs in Low and Middle Income Countries Guiding Principles for Working Internationally 

00:03:20
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD So, what I'm, what I'm hoping to do in my few minutes is to share with you a little bit about the mental health needs as we know it in low and middle income countries, which is, you know, I'm, I'm talking, I'm starting there because Haiti is the only low, middle income country in the Caribbean, right, and so, that I'm gonna be using that as, uh, some of the examples. But also about what is currently being done to address the needs of these particular regions, as well as to share with you some of the framework that we've been using to do work internationally in Haiti and other parts of the Caribbeans in-, including, um, in, in Latin America as well. That is my goal, to do that all in 'bout 30 minutes so I can, so we can have some time for discussions. 

00:04:10
SETTING THE STAGE FAIRY + SONG = LESSON 

00:04:10
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD So, I wanted to start off with, um, a perspective, a little bit, because it always good to, to know what is our, what is the frame, what is the stage that we wanna be able to understand. So, I wanted to share with you this story. It's a very well known story in Haiti. If you grew up in Haiti you've heard it, and if you haven't heard it it may be because you are from different parts of Haiti. As you know, Haiti's a huge country. Depending on where you are, the stories are very different, the language is a little bit different, and so forth. So, here's how this story goes: There was an, uh, uh, uh, a man that was born with a hump. He was born with a hump in his back, right, and because of the hump he really wasn't able to do the things that he wanted to do. He wasn't able to really, um, to, to get the jobs that he wanted. He wasn't able to get the woman he wanted, in terms of his life. So, it really effected him. One night, he wasn't able to sleep, and he decided to go out for a walk. While he's out takin' a walk, he sees a group of fairies dancing and singing. He, he thought it was the most amazing thing, seeing these groups of fairies dancing and having a grand old time. So, he grabbed himself a big ole rick, sat down, and watched them do their dancing, their stories. Okay, so how many of you speak a little French? Great, so, okay, I'm gonna need you a little help, cuz this is like a participating, and we need to wake up, right? and so, the story the fairies were singing goes something like this: lundi, mardi, mercredi, jeudi, lundi, mardi, mercredi, jeudi, c'mon now, lundi mardi, mercredi, jeudi, lundi, mardi, mercredi, lundi, mardi, lundi, mardi. Oh, they were having a grand old time, and they were dancing and singing, right. And after he watched this, he joined in, into the singing, and he joined in with the fairies, he started dancing ans singing, going lundi, mardi, mercredi, lundi, mardi, mercredi, lundi, mardi, mercredi. Oh, the fairies loved him, this man who came to be a part of their group, and they had a grand old time with him, and at the end of it all, they said, "How can we show how much we appreciate him and what he's done?" One of the fairies said, "Let's remove his hump." and they removed his hump. The man was in amaze. Now he was able to move around freely, and do the things that he needed to do. And so, the next day, he ran into another man who had another hump, but in another town over. He said, "Aye, Robert, what happened? What happened to your hump?" He said, "Oh, I met this group of fairies, and I had, we had such a grand old time, and at the end of it they removed my hump." He said, "Where is this group of fairies? I need to go and see them so they can remove my hump." He said, "Well, you gotta go. There's a, you know, about 11:00 you go into this path, you'll find the group of fairies, and then you'll see them dancing, and then join them, and everything will be good." He did exactly that. The next day he got up and went, found exact same group of fairies, they were singing and dancing and having a grand old time, singing exactly the same song that goes: lundi, mardi, mercredi, jeudi, lundi, mardi, mercredi, lundi, mardi, mercredi. Oh, he couldn't believe his eyes! They were having such a grand old time. He decided, I'm gonna join in as well, just like the, you know, he, uh, was told. I'm gonna join in this group of fairies. He joined the group, and then he started singing and dancing. He started by saying, "Mardi, mercredi, jeudi, lundi, vendredi, mercredi, jeu...The fairies said, "What is this? Right, who is this man who comes in, messed up the song." None of them were dancing anymore, right. They were all staying back, watching this guy, and he was boogiein' with his own way with the song, right. And so wha-, he really messes up their whole party. So, at the end of the ball, what did they do? They gave him the hump of the guy from yest-, the day before. Right, so that is a very common story that you hear in Haiti 

00:09:00
SETTING THE STAGE FAIRY + SONG = LESSON 

00:09:00
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD But what is the lesson? What would you say is the lesson from that story? Right, you know I only have 30 minutes. The faster you speak, the faster we can get on. So what's the lesson? Right, you gotta be in tune, right, absolutely, right. You gotta pay attention, right. You gotta observe, you gotta pay attention, you gotta be, you can't go into another community, another culture and start messing up the song when you haven't had an opportunity to learn the song, right. Absolutely apropos to the work that we did, we do in other communities, and the work that we do internationally, right. To what extent are we listening to the song, paying attention to the practices and the customs before we go, right, and impart our own song, and our own dance, right? 

00:09:55
MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS Across the Globe LOW INCOME COUNTRIES MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES 

00:09:55
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD And so, when you look at mental health issues across the globe, you know that the needs are great, right. So it's, it, it, it, there's a reason as to why we all are, wanna, wanna respond to mental health issue across the globe, because the great, the needs are absolutely out there, and there really, there's a need for us to really begin to address them. Not only is there need, but then we see that the need is even greater in low income, and low-middle income countries, right, as well. And there's a lot of explanation as to why, what's, what's the, what are the causes, what are the issues... 

00:10:35
THE LARGER PICTURE *Mental, neurological and substance abuse disorders (MNS) account for about 13% of the global burden of disease and 30% of the burden of non-communicable disease (Collins, Patel, & Joestl, 2011) *Mental disorders account for an average of 11% of the total burden of disease in LMICs (Patel, 2007) *Low levels of education, poor housing, and low income levels (LUND, et al, 2010) are some of the factors leading to higher 

00:10:35
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD That one needs to think about, and so education, housing, and so forth have been seen as some of the factors that seems to be connected to that, right. So, if you look at something just like depression, for example, this is what the data looks like when we look at low-middle income countries, right, in terms of rate of, um, disorders specific, uh, across, right, across these regions that we're talking about. In terms of the by, by low income and middle income we really are referring to, like I said, the only low income country is, is Haiti. The low-middle income countries are places like Guatemala, right, um, it falls right after Haiti in terms of the nu-, other, um, country that's received the most NGOs, um, related to some mental health related issues, right. 

00:11:25
Needs In the Caribbean & Latin America *Of the 30 countries that comprise the Latin America and Caribbean regions in the 2011 World Bank database, Haiti is classified as the only Low Income Country (define as $1,005 or less annual per capita income), whereas eight are classified as Lower Middle Income Countries ($1,006 - $3,975 annual per capita income) Belize, Bolivia, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, and El Salvador. * In 1978, the World Health organization (WHO) asked the Caribbean governments to study and implement both traditional and Western medicine strategies as part of a national primary health care initiative. 

00:11:30
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD In addition to that, the other low-middle income countries to think about, and you see how we define it. This is not Guerda's definition, this is the, the World Bank's definition of, of, uh, low and middle income countries. Um, so other places like, uh, El Salvador, Nira-, Nicaragua, and so forth are also countries that falls in that area. 

00:11:45
Needs in Haiti *The highest rates of infant and maternal mortality (see section A.2.1), chronic malnutrition, ans HIV ((Office of U.S. AIDS Coordinator and the Bureau of Public Affairs, 2009). *Malnutrition is thus a significant problem, with half the population identified as "food insecure" (defined as no access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food for an active and healthy life), and even fewer having access to clean drinking water. * A Haitian life expectancy at birth is only 54 years (compared to U.S. life expectancy of 78 years) *A more recent report indicates that there are 2% of psychologists and .028% of psychiatrists per 100,000 inhabitants in the island (WHO, 2011). 

00:11:50
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD So, let's take a look, for example, at Haiti, right, as the only low income country in the area, right. So, if you look at the data in Haiti, people, you know, eh, eh, eh, the, the, the data with respect to mental health is coming slowly, but if you look at what the WHO is reporting, and that is our big source, um, or international information... 

00:12:10
Needs in Haiti *The highest rates of infant and maternal mortality (see section A.2.1), chronic malnutrition, ans HIV ((Office of U.S. AIDS Coordinator and the Bureau of Public Affairs, 2009). *Malnutrition is thus a significant problem, with half the population identified as "food insecure" (defined as no access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food for an active and healthy life), and even fewer having access to clean drinking water. * A Haitian life expectancy at birth is only 54 years (compared to U.S. life expectancy of 78 years) *A more recent report indicates that there are 2% of psychologists and .028% of psychiatrists per 100,000 inhabitants in the island (WHO, 2011). 

00:12:10
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD Is we see that there's a high rate of infant and ma-, and maternal mortality, um, in Haiti, there's a chronic malnu-, malnutrition, HIV is rampant. Those are the lovely pictures that we often get, right, on, on CNN about uh, what Haiti, um, is about, and I can go on and on and on. There was also a really wonderful report by the New York Times that indicated that in addition to the fact that are really these high rate of needs in Haiti, but also there's very little resources. My very favorite was the New York Time article that documented that there were only 10 psychologists in Haiti, and two psychiatrists after the earthquake, right. So, if you saw the New York Times, and was like you, and you are a mental health provider, and you are of a particular Haitian background, you can't help but respond after this massive earthquake, and to hear that there's only 10 psychologists and two psychiatrists, right. When, in fact, there's a Haitian Psychological Association that has 120 members in it, right, and there are 58 psychiatrists in the country, right. So, it, wa-, what, it's interesting in terms of the kind of information you will get. Okay, but so, the other thing I think is really interesting in terms of thinking about addressing the needs, often time, when, when people are talking about Haiti, or talking about lower-middle income countries, there's an image that is portrayed to you, right. And, so if you look at these images, as an individual, as a human being, you can't help but want to respond. So, if I, if you look at these images coupled with the data I just showed you, so you saw the data, you see the New York Times that says there's not a lot of psychologists, not a lot of psychiatrists, and then you follow that by these images, your like, I have got to do something, right. I, I need to respond in some ways, right, for to this particular community, right. So, the question is... 

00:14:05
What if the Picture Was Different? 

00:14:05
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD What would happen if you had a different image, right? Would we respond to Haiti in the same way if, in fact, you saw a different perspective of what Haiti's about, right. So, if you saw these images, these are pictures I took, and some of my colleagues took, same country, same exact place, right. So, are we likely to respond if you see these images in the front page of your local paper, or in the CNN news, right? So, who's trying to tell you to do what? What are they asking you to ta-, to do, right, and for what reason? What is the motivation for the images that you get to see about a particular community, and about a particular co-, country, right? 

00:14:55
Needs in Guatemala *According to data from PAHO, 75% of the population lives in poverty. *In 1994 there were 1,720 reported deaths caused by trauma, poisoning, and other injuries and external causes; 85% of these deaths were in men and 15% were in women. *Guatemala is part of the "northern triangle" among the most violent in the world (Kjaerulf & Barahona, 2010). *Estimated mortality from homicide in the population over 15 years of age was 47 per 100,000 population in 2004, five to seven times the global average (Garcia & Matute, 2007) *According to the National Survey on Mental Health conducted in 1009, it is estimated that one-fourth of the population (27.5%) between 18 and 65 years may have some kind of emotional disorder. *It is estimated that there are 0.61, psychiatrist, 7.07 psychologists, and 1.43 nurses per 100,000 population (National Report on Mental Health System Guatemala, 2011) 

00:14:55
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD Here's what we know about Guatemala, which is the other place that a lot of NGOs go to, right, to provide mental health needs, right. And again, um, if you look at the power(ph) of the Pan-American Health Organization, as well as the WHO data, there's clearly was a, a need. There are needs in these particular cou-, region as well, right. That we see that they, um, there is a National Survey of Mental Health that was just conducted in 2009 there, showed that, um, that, that a, a number of the population is 30% or, or more have some kinds of emotional disorders, right. But we also though know that the, the number, what we've been told is that the number of psychologists and other mental health providers in that region is also very low, right, is also very low, right, so high need, low service providers, right. So, these are the images that we often see about Guatemala, right. So, if you, you do images of Guatemala, and you say, "I'd like to learn more about Gua-, Guatemala given what I just heard about the needs. Let me get a sense of what the issues are." these are the images that you likely to see over and over again that perpetuates the media, right. How many of you ever been to Guatemala? Yes, great, okay. 

00:16:15
How Do we Construct These Images? 

00:16:15
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD So, what about these, I, I go off on myself, so I, how do we make sense about those images, and how do you make sense of the, the images that you just saw, especially if you yourself have gone? Right, and you have an opportunity to also see lots of different aspects of that country. It's not to say that those things are not in existence, it's not to show that level of poverty that I showed you about Haiti is not there, but the question is, do you get a one-sided perspective, right, about the, about the particular region? So, what, how, how 'bout if you saw the pictures, right, of Guatemala, right, as well? Right, would the response be very different? Right, are we more, are we likely to turn off the news, are you likely to remember Guatemala, are you likely to start thinking about, I need to do something, right? So, there's a, there's a, there's an importance in how do we construct, right, images that we see, but it seems very salient that we need to pay attention to the story that somebody is telling us, and how do we go beyond what we've been exposed to to really get the full picture, right, before we respond, before we go into something, right, in that country. 

00:17:25
September 2011 09/05 Somalia famine may kill 750,000/ 09/07 Airliner with ice hockey team in fatal crash 09/10 Scores die as Zanzibar ship sinks 09/12 Dozens die in pipeline fire 09/13 Floods kill more than 200 in Pakistan 09/16 Air race crash: 9 people killed, 52 injured 09/18 16 dead in India, Nepal after 6.9 quake 09/18 16 dead in India, Nepal after 6.9 quake October 2011 10/10 NZ ship oil spill 'significant' 10/19 Ohio police hunt escaped animals 10/20 Thai flooding threatens capital 10/23 7.2 quake strikes eastern Turkey 10/24 Death toll rises after Turkish quake 10/23 7.2 quake strikes eastern Turkey 10/24 Death toll rises after Turkish quake 10/27 Pulled alive 100 hours after earthquake November 2011 11/04 Dozens rescued from Chinese mine 11/09 Turkish earthquake topples hotel 11/11 Mexican interior minister killed in crash 11/09 Turkish earthquake topples hotel 

00:17:25
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD So, what happened if it was closer to home? Right, like, what happened to all of the other disasters, and we know that if you go and you look at disasters, for those of us who do disasters-related work across the globe, you, we pay a li-, attention to a lot of those things, right. I mean, there was a huge earthquake in Turkey, right, just in last October, right. Didn't get a lot of news, didn't make it to your local news, lots of devastation, right, and so forth. So, the question is certain places are more salient than the others? Why is it likely that Guatemala and Haiti will make it in the news, but Turkey will not, right? And what happened if there's this huge flood that takes place in New York, where people have lost their power and not able to get into their homes, and so forth? Do we respond there as well? Right, so the question is, like, why respond in one way, but not the other, right, um, which is interesting for me to think about, right? 

00:18:25
91 killed in Norway Island Massacre. Capital Blast Missouri 89 killed by Missouri tornado 04/28-Japan Death toll from storms in South near 300 09/13 Floods kill more than 200 in Pakistan 9/05 Somalia famine 'may kill 750,000' New York-Huge storm tears across New York 

00:18:25
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD And so, I put some of these up there just to show that there are lots of dif-, lots of disasters going on throughout the globe, here in the US, and so forth. And so, the question is, for me always, is, as a person who does work internationally, I should care about all aspects of it, right, not necessarily just when something happened in Haiti, and there's an opportunity for me to go internationally to do my thing, that I'm responding to it, right. So, how that becomes a part of my everyday, um, um, process, and, and so forth. 

00:19:00
The Role of NGOs 

00:19:00
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD I have to talk a little bit about NGOs before I go into the framework, because NGOs are, are very, um, are, are huge, eh, especially in Haiti, um, for the last couple years. Before that, um, there was the kids, but certainly, um, but certainly in the last, since the earthquake, the number of NGOs have doubled. In Port-au-Prince alone, there are 1,556 NGOs, in Port-au-Prince. 20 of them have been registered with the government. Did you get that number? Right, the number of NGOs that are in this country providing services that the government doesn't know, right, where they are? And so, now Josue Pierre-Louis, who is, eh, eh, somebody I've been working with for the last 15 years, is trying to, and the only reason I know the number is because we're trying to figure out who are the NGOs in Haiti, what re they doin', where are they, how long will they be there, what kind of program are they really being implemented, because it's causing a number of issues, right, as you can imagine, right. 

00:20:10
Number of NGOs in Low and Middle Income Countries *In Guatemala, there 725 NGOs, of which 469 are category 6 (central sector organizations). *In Haiti reportedly the highest number of NGOs per capita, there are 549 NGOs, of which 379 are central sector organizations** Compare these numbers with just 190 (44CSOs) in Trinidad and 219 (74CSOs) in Jamaica. *Garonne (cite) warns that harm may occur unintentionally through breaking the local economy, providing service delivery that harms the health and well-being of the local people and by reinforcing conflict. 

00:20:10
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD So, um, so here the number, as we know it specifically, for places like Guatemala, and these are, are old numbers. As soon as any kind of disasters happen, then the number goes up, uh, you know, tremendously. Right, and, um, these are the numbers of documented NGOs in Haiti. I say documented Hai-, NGOs, um, because those are the ones where you can go on their website, and you will see they say something about the work that they are doing in Haiti, even though they are not registered in Haiti, right. Okay, so I'm boring you enough. 

00:20:40
Our Experiences 

00:20:40
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD So, let me share with you a little bit about my, some of my experiences, in terms of the work that we've been doing, um, in, in Haiti for the last couple, couple of years. I've been working in Haiti for the last 15 years, right. Why Haiti? It's personal. I was born and raised in Haiti, right, and, and I think it's important, right, as to why you chose the community that you're gonna, you chose to work in. It can't be because it just seem like the right thing to do. There's gotta be a reason as to why you feeling a sense of connection, right, to, you know, to this particular region, and try to respond in this particular way. For me, Haiti is personal, right. And so, Haiti gave me everything that I, who I am today is because I was born in Haiti. I absolutely believe that, right. And so, I owe a responsibility, for me, to go back home, right, as often, and I go home to Haiti once a month, and I've been going to Haiti, well before the earthquake, doing some of the work that we've been doing in Haiti, right. So, it has a personal connection to it. I think it's important that, based on the work that we've been doing, we've developing a framework, and I am so cautious of it, which is interesting for me in the last couple of years, because we've been doing this work in Haiti for a number of years. It never occurred to me to spend the time to write about the mental health capacity building work that we were doing in Haiti, right, because it was never about that. It was never about publishing it, and publicizing it to others. But boy the earthquake in Haiti taught me differently, right, because if it's not in existence, if you can't Google it, people make the assumption that it's not there. Right, so it has to be in print, so people can use it, otherwise it really feels like you're gonna do something new, when, in fact, we may been doing mental health work for a number of years, right. And so, based on that work, it, we've developed a framework for the work we see as important, for the work not only we've been doing in Haiti, but also in other parts of the Caribbean as well. 

00:22:40
The Foundation In country Partnership In Country Resources Needs Assessment 

00:22:40
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD I think, at the foundational level, you need to have an in country partnership. There's gotta be a group, a organization in Haiti, in Guatemala, in Brooklyn, in, I'm just, you know, whatever community you in, if that's the work that you're gonna do, that you are partnering with, because that has got to be the part about the sustainability of the work, right. How do you, how does it not become just about you? Right, but it's really is about partnering with a, with an organization to really work with them in implementing the, the kind of programs and work that you want to be able to do, right. I think the in-partnership is crucial, right, and by in country partnership, for us, I'm talking about when we are in Port-au-Prince, or we are in Tiguave, or we are in Cap-Haitien, we have a partnership with, we have, um, an organization, they are key organization partner, we have a relationship with the ministry, so that the ministry knows the work that we are doing, we have a community advisory board, right, who oversees the program. So, if you go into, you know, Tiguave, or Grand-Goave, and Cap-Haitien, and you say, "I'd like to learn about the Guerda Project." right, the answer should be I don't know what you're talking about, right, if we've done it well. The answer should be, I don't know what you're talking about. But if you go and say, "I'd like to learn about the mental health project of the south." that will get you to the right person, right, cuz that is about our community advisory group, and our partner, and so forth. Right, so the, when I'm talking about this coun-, this in country partnership, and when you're thinking about going to another country, and you wanna work with the Organization, you wanna know who their partners are, to what extent do the ministry knows about their work, to what ex-, what extent are they working with the churches, right, and the other agencies in that area, which is really, really essential. Once you've done that... 

00:24:40
The Foundation In country Partnership In Country Resources Needs Assessment 

00:24:40
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD I think it's really is important to do a needs assessment. Right, and so. I'll share with you an example of some things that happened after the earthquake, and I have plenty of them. I can have stories after stories, right. There's a wonderful organization in California, after the earthquake, who spent a lot of time and energy to get 15 toilets from California to Haiti, specifically in Leogabe, which was the epicenter of the earthquake, right. Imagine trying to get 15 toilets from California to Haiti. That's not an easy feat, right, to absolut-, to do that. Right, so they get the 15 toilets to Haiti, right, we have programs running in Leogane, right, nothing can be done with the 15 toilets. Why? Why? Plumbing is not there, people don't have a home, and so, it's great that I have 15 toilets, but where am I putting the 15 toilets? So, the 15 toilets sat in a church area, right, and whenever I would go, the pastor says, "I don't know what I should do with the toilets. What do you think I should do with the toilets?" Right, and then the plan for when the, the group wanted to come, because, you know, not only when you try to address a need that you need to deliver, but you also need to follow that up with some follow-up trip, so you can take some pictures of how the toilets have been used, so you can put them on the website, so people can see how you used the toilet. So, now the group wanted to be able to come back from California to be able to take some photos of the toilets so that they can be able to share it back with the people who helped support this mission, right. So the, our community group said, "Can you do it in January, cuz, you know, Guerda's coming," and then, and then they said, "When they come, those are your people." their my people, from California. You talk to them about why we're not gonna use the toilets, right. So, being able to sit with them, and, and for them to understand why, although that was very commendable of them to have done, make the effort to do that, the need for 15 toilet is not the priority right now. And part of that is not doing a true assessment of the needs of that region before you do it, right. And we have lots of examples of our colleagues who just respond with something; I have a package of something, I have a package of the debriefing, I have a package of x and I'm going to go in this community and deliver it without the community ever knowing, right, or be ready for that particular need. Right, so goo need assessment with your community partners is absolutely important. The other piece that I think is crucial in terms of the foundation, is to, is to recognize... 

00:27:30
The Foundation In country Partnership In Country Resources Needs Assessment 

00:27:30
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD Is to recognize the in country resources that are already in place. We make the assumptions when we go into another country that there's nothing there. That this is, like, new, that you're doing it, like, like, so innovative, that you're the only person who ever thought about addressing mental health issues in Haiti, right. There's a whole lot of people. So, how do you connect, and understand and use the resources, and be able to leverage what has been done in partnership with the skills, and what you bringin', right? So, it is important that you know that there's a group of people who are been fast at work addressing these particular issues, right, and makin' sure that you are working with them in implementing whatever you about to implement, right? So, your not the only resource, right, um, uh, that, that, that is coming in to be able to do that work. 

00:28:25
CULTURE COUNTS Knowledge Staff Curriculum 

00:28:25
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD The next part, I think, that we've seen that really is important is this issue about the importance of culture, right. I don't have to convince anybody in the 29th Annual Con-, Conference of TC Round Table about the importance of culture, right? We all get that, right? And people that are the closest to me, who do-, does this work fantastically here, still manage to show up in Haiti with a packet of measures that hasn't been translated, with some documents that they think is gonna be appropriate to be used in the country, and it's not. Right, and so we do know that understanding the... 

00:29:00
CULTURE COUNTS Knowledge Staff Curriculum 

00:29:00
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD Cultural knowledge is important. Not, do you speak Creole. There's a difference. It's not that you know the language, but do you understand the concept, and the constructs, and the meaning of those things in Haiti. For example, we don't have a word in Hait-, Haitian Creole for depression, or trauma. The closest we come to depression is discouragement, deprime, right. Right, that's our French term, deprime, which means to be discouraged, to be deprived. If you translate that back to English, that's not depression, right. Trauma is another word. Now, if you go to Haiti before the earthquake, I didn't hear that word a lot. After the earthquake, lot's of people are saying, "I have, mwen gen yon trauma. Genyen trauma." (inaudible ) ou genyen kisa? What, what do you have? I have a trauma, said, "What is that?" said, "I don't know, but the group from Missouri who came last month said to us that we have trauma, and we need to do something about that." Right, and so, it's like these concepts that has very different meanings for us here, but when you hear it, of course this group must have had some trauma, right. So, we use this terminologies and this language as a way of imparting our knowledge on this end, over there, right. And the great things about Haitians is we're very good, we're very respectful of being responsive to you, so when you say we have a trauma, we say, "Oh, okay, good to know, you know, that that's what we have." We're very respectful, we don't know what that means, so you give the measure, people that have no idea what the measure means, they have no idea what a Likert scale is, right, but they'll complete it, right, because you giving it, right, and they're likely to do it, right. So, we know that the, the knowledge base is important, not just in terms of, do you speak the language, but do you understand the cultural nuances and the cultural meanings of the various terms, and Haitian Creole is one of those languages that is so metaphoric, right. It's not the Straightforward word, it's everything that came before the word, and everything that comes after the word. It's not the word itself that tells you how the person is experiencing that particular concept, right. So, it, it is important to go beyond just the translation of it, right. The other thing that I, that we see that's important, is the... 

00:31:45
CULTURE COUNTS Knowledge Staff Curriculum 

00:31:45
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD The cultural training of the staff, right. How do you train your staff, yourself, to be prepared to go and do work in another community, right? What's the cultural training, right? None of my groups get to go unless we've spent several sessions about understanding Haitian history, Haitian culture, understanding the money, right. Cuz, uh, a number of years ago we had a wonderful, uh, student who went with us, and you know, somebody offered her a mango for $5, and she bought a mango for $5. She was very good, because she was able to use her creole language to purchase the mango for $5. That messed me up for a very long time in Haiti, because, you know, the idea of buying one mango for five US dollars when one US dollar in Haiti is 47 gourde. So $5 for that mango, that poor, that one woman was done for the day, right. So, it's kind of sets up this idea, right, in terms of doing community work, that you don't want, right. So, it is important that, that you make sure the staff is trained. 

00:32:55
CULTURE COUNTS Knowledge Staff Curriculum 

00:33:00
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD The other thing that we see is how important it is that the curriculum is also very culturally relevant, right. That it is absolutely essential that the curriculum that you use, not only has been translated in the language, but it's relevant to the particular group that you're working with, right. So, our mental health capacity program has a focuses on, on depression and anxiety, it focuses on trauma. Those are not terms we use in the book, right. So, we have to use the language and the concepts that are relevant to the particular person, right, to the particular culture. So, for us, like, a good example is something like anxiety in, in, you would never hear anxiety, which is like the French word. If you Google it, and God help me with this Google translation. Ah, I don't know what Google did to us with this Google Haitian Creole translation. It's killing me, right, because people are now able to go in, and plug their stuff into the Google translation, and suddenly they think they know Creole like no tomorrow. And I said, "Well how do you say anxiety?" and they said, "We say anxiety." I was like, you know, very proud too, anxiety. It's like, what is that? You go to, uh, Haiti, you go, I have, gen yon anxiety, people are like, well, you have a what? Right, like what is that? But if you go and say, "K� m'sou (inaudible )". Ah, K� sou (inaudible ), which means my heart is overly beating. It's a very, see, heart overly beating does not translate to your DSM criteria, right, of anxiety, right. And so, it is important that the curriculum, and the materials, and the content is gonna be very relevant to the group as well, right. Okay, um, I got my little, um warning. The, the other piece that I think is important to think about in terms of work that any of us... 

00:34:50
Capacity Building Train The Trainers Model Program Evaluation 

00:34:50
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD May want to do in Haiti is, to what extent is the work building capacity in the region, right? Is it really you coming in to do the work, and then leaving, right, without understanding the implications for what that would look like, right? We had a very interesting experience right after the earthquake, like six months after the earthquake, which is not atypical for, like disasters and trauma. Whenever there's a disaster, or, uh, in any particular region, we see an increased rate of violence, specifically sexual violence. That is known, right, that we see that, right. So, exactly the same thing started occurring in Haiti after the earthquake. There was an increased rate of sexual violence happening in the camp, right. Our good ole former President, Bill Clinton, who was, as you know, was our big Ambassador to Haiti decided that they were gonna address this issue in the camp by distributing whistles. Did you get that? 

00:35:55
UNKNOWN Yep. 

00:35:55
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD Mm-hm. So, Bill Clinton brought about 15,000 whistles; blue, red, green, pink, bright green, whatever you want, and they distribute them to the young folks in the camp, right, so that when, now when they were being sexually assaulted, they can just blew their whistle, and then, you know, people would, they, it, it would scare away, right, the, the person, right. Now, if Bill didn't know anything about Haitians, he should have known a whole lot about black folks in America, and that we don't blow the whistle on anybody, right. And so, the idea that you can absolutely distribute these whistles, and also because sexual violence after trauma is not connected to that. It's an issue about feeling powerlessness, right. It's an issue about why didn't you, an issue about defensiveness. You would know that it would actually increase the rate. Whistles were distributed to the camps, violence went up severely. Several of like, brutal rape cases occurred, and then the group of people that Bill had to distribute the whistles came back and re-collected the whistles. Didn't make the CNN news. Did you see that on the CNN news? Nope, didn't see those collection of the whistles, right, in CNN news, right. So, the issue is, to what extent addressing that particular need could have used, right, the elders of the camps, could've used an advisory group to really help them understand, how do I do that, right? But also recognizing that there's an intervention, I come up with a brilliant intervention, all of us do that, have great ideas. You come up with the intervention, you deliver it, and then you go home, right. You don't have an opportunity to see the overall impact after you leave, right. And we had many instances like that, in Haiti, where somebody delivered something, and then the 110 psychologists I talked to you about had to go back and undo some of the things that were being done. Part of that is because it didn't have a capacity building component to it, right. It was a thing that one gets to do so that we can say, "Yes, I did something." right. We can at least say, "I did something in response to this particular disaster." And so, for us.. 

00:38:15
Capacity Building Train The Trainers Model Program Evaluation 

00:38:15
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD What's been crucial has been, how do we train trainers in the community, so both community base workers, to train them in this mental health capacity building program, as well as training physicians and nurses on mental health issues, who becomes the deliverers of those programs in the future, right? And so, the goal for me, is to get fired as quickly as possible, right. So, if I'm able to train a group of people, and they're able to do their work, I become like their consultant, right, in terms of the work, right. And so, in that, in the community, there's a group of people who can always respond to the needs of that particular region. The other, I think, crucial thing... 

00:39:00
Capacity Building Train The Trainers Model Program Evaluation 

00:39:00
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD Is the need to also add a program evaluation, right. Not your program evaluation, but an evaluation that is gonna help the community make this program better, right, because you have to think about how you feeding the data that you collected back into the community that you are, you, you, you've been working in, right, so that wh-, that it can continue to do that work. Okay, I'm really running out of time. 

00:39:25
What Type of Outcome Do We Want? "So I want to tell you that when you're doing your studies with our youth and us, we tell you what we really think and believe. We don't tell you what we tell other researchers. We tell them what we want them to know, but we don't go into much detail. And sometimes a few of us will make up stories so that they'll go away and we don't insult them by saying [no] to them" (Trimble & Mohatt, 2006, p. 332) 

00:39:25
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD I love this quote by George Trimble, because I think it really represents a bit about what I've seen in Haiti. Because I, when I go to Haiti, they're very good at telling me who's been there, especially in the communities that I go to, right. So, whenever I go there, they're, they're very good at by collecting materials from the groups who were there when I wasn't there. They're like, oh, last time when you weren't here there was a group who came, I mean, there was a group a couple of months ago that went to Haiti, and continued to tell the people about how they were being penalized, or, you know, uh, because of some sin by God, and so forth, and they were there to, you know. But they, they took, they took out the material for me, so I could see who this group, you know, out of Missouri, this religious group, and so forth, so I can respond to them, and so forth. Because I think, often I hear this, be(ph) people talk about the difference between what they tell the foreigners who come versus what they tell the people who they know is really, truly there, right. So, you know that the information that you might be collecting might not be valid, right. You may have just collected information, but to what extent it is valid, and a valid representation of the people is, is questionable, right. So, I hope that, um, that all of this, that one of the things that you're taking away, if you fell asleep to some of this, that you are seeing how important it is for us to really look at the... 

00:40:45
Recommendations for Researchers & Clinicians Need be educated about the culture Belief system is an important component of mental health among ethnic and immigrant groups Culture counts with regard to thoughts, emotions and behavior Measures and intervention needs to be culturally sensitive 

00:40:45
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD Culture, and the groups that you are interested in doing, and understanding ways that all aspects of that can effect the work that you go in to do, right, the work that you want to be able to do. But, more importantly, I do think... 

00:41:00
Recommendations for Researchers & Clinicians Need be educated about the culture Belief system is an important component of mental health among ethnic and immigrant groups Culture counts with regard to thoughts, emotions and behavior Measures and intervention needs to be culturally sensitive 

00:41:00
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD There's an issue about how you really are measuring the things that you are doing so that it's not a one time deal, right. I know that a number of my colleagues, I'm looking at you guys who are going to Haiti, are gonna go, you know, it is important to think about how am I gonna measure that, and I'm gonna feed it back to the community, and what measure I'm gonna use. We've tried a number of measures in, in Haiti with respect to depression and trauma, and they just not workin', so I look forward to hearing what people are using because the CDS didn't work for me, the BDI didn't work for me, the PCL didn't work for me, a number of the measures, and part of that is because we askin' the questions about the meaning behind the items, as well as the scaling of it, right. So, we, we know we can't use a one to five scale approach in Haiti, cuz it has no meaning. So, we've had to really use the, the glass, the scaling of a glass, where we have a glass, a picture of a glass that has nothing, that has a little something, that has a little bit more something, and that's fully full, right. So, when we asking the people questions about how, how did they feel, we asking them to tell us in the picture of a glass. Because the Likert scale, and the way that we've been trained to know it, just doesn't work in the same way, right. 

00:42:10
"Addressing Cultural issues is the important work for the academy, the nation, and the world. It is socially urgent, intellectually compelling, and personally transforming" 

00:42:10
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD Um, so I, I, I know you share this with me, in terms of understanding how important it is for us to address the cultural element of the things that we do, right. It is absolutely crucial for us to do it, but it's not good, it's not just good work. It is absolutely essential if we really want to do good work in Haiti, and other parts of the world, and not even internationally, but also here on our own local backyard, it is important that we make sure that that work is relevant to the communities that we are serving, and I thank you for your time. Thank you. 

00:42:50
MERCI Gracias Thank YOU MESI 

00:42:55
GUERDA NICOLAS, PHD One of the things, you know, I try for five years in working in Haiti to try to translate, and make meaning of the words from the US to Haitian Creole, and so forth. I give up on that. Right, because you can translate it, back translate it over and over, and we tried the methods, it still doesn't get at the cultural meaning aspect, right. And so, for us, like, we have a depression measure right now that we use that was created using indigenous approaches, right, asking people about ways that they think about these issues, and so forth. So in, so our depression measure is much more connected to the ways that Haitians experience depression. We're doing exactly the same thing right now with, um, creating a symptoms checklist, because the Ministry of Health in Haiti is asking us, after all of our interviews wi-, in Hai-, in Haiti to create a measure that can be used, right, by physicians, by teachers as a screening tool. So, Janet is my consultant, she's my assessment guru person to go to, because while we've been able to interview a lots of people to get a sense about the way they experience trauma, now the question is, what do I do about the fact that when you take something like, um, when you ask somebody how they felt after the earthquake, I got 15 head related symptoms, right. So, it's not like, I have a headache, it's tet vire, tet spinning, right, you know, tet case, tet sote, tet femal, like, so there's like, ah, like 15 different ways that you can indicate that something is happening to your head post the earthquake. Same thing about your heart, like 13 different ways of saying something is wrong with my heart, how I'm feeling here after the earthquake. So, the questions, like how do you, wha-, how do you take that, in an, in an indigenous way, try to transform it in some kind of Westernized measure that somebody who's going to Haiti is gonna be able to use that, right, effectively? I know how to do it for the Haiti side, I don't know how to do it for the translating it from Haitian, from Haiti, back here, so I go to Janet. Right, so I, I bug her to tell her, like, how do I do this, how do I do it and still not lose sight of the importance of the meaning. Because there's the literal meaning, because when somebody said, "My, my head is spinning," my tet mwen vire, right, they don't mean like, my head is really spinning like that, it's just metaphorically, this is what's happening to me. Or, my head is big, tet mwen gwo, right, they don't mean there head is big, but it's metaphorical, so how do you not lose that, right, within a symptoms checklist? Right, so I think that's the challenge for us, but I think it's absolutely not acceptable is to say because we don't know how to do it, let's just use a measure. At least we have one. Right, to me that's not, just not acceptable, yeah. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I know I'm out of time, and Carrie's(ph) next after me, so thank you.
