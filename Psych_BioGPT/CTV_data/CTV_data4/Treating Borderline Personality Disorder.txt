BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
NARRATOR One of the most perplexing of all psychological conditions is borderline personality disorder, unable to find solutions to their myriad problems these patients often resort to unpredictable and potentially dangerous actions. 

00:00:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Are you feeling like killing yourself right this moment? 

00:00:15
NARRATOR These distorted beliefs and impulsive behaviors make this complex disorder extremely difficult to treat. 

00:00:25
Treating Borderline Personality Disorder The Dialectical Approach With Marsha M. Linehan, PhD 

00:00:30
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Everyone agree now, borderline personality disorder is a self and predictive(ph) suicide. 

00:00:35
NARRATOR Marsha Linehan, is director of the Suicidal Behaviors Research Clinic at the University of Washington in Seattle, where she is also professor of Psychology and Psychiatry. 

00:00:50
MARSHA M. LINEHAN This is the problem, the emotional, pain that they experience, can’t be reduced, has to be tolerated and they cannot tolerate it and the suicidal behavior is ultimately an attempt to change that pain and reduce it. 

00:01:10
NARRATOR Dr. Linehan recently published a book that outlines her approach to treating patients with borderline personality disorder. This program will present an overview of her treatment model, which Dr. Linehan calls dialectical behavior therapy or DBT. We will describe the main components of DBT, including a definition of dialectics, the goals of treatment, the various modes of therapy and outcome data from a study Dr. Linehan conducted on the effects of DBT in the treatment of women who met criteria for borderline personality disorder. 

00:01:50
MARSHA M. LINEHAN I was thinking that was… 

00:01:50
NARRATOR Then at the conclusion of the program Dr. Linhan and Dr. Allen Frances, Chairman of the DSM-IV task force will discuss a number of the issues concerning the treatment of these patients. 

00:02:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …emergency services people… 

00:02:05
Dialectics 

00:02:10
NARRATOR The theoretical framework for understanding DBT, is dialectics. Dialectics is a process of achieving balance, in DBT, synthesis or balance is sort on several levels, the desire for patients to change is balanced with acceptance of the patients problems as they are. The goal of teaching patients how to solve their problems is balanced by the need to simultaneously validate those difficulties. A straight forward somewhat irreverent attitude toward the patients problems by the therapist is balanced by a reciprocal warmth and understanding. And finally directly interceding in the patients environment is balanced with teaching them how to interact on their own. Dr. Linehan’s research on DBT is an ongoing process, therefore therapy sessions are always monitored, the purpose is to observe the behavior of the therapist and ensure adherence to the treatment manual. To illustrate Dr. Linehan’s approach to treating borderline personality disorder, recreations and actual patient interviews will be used. However to maintain patient confidentiality the images have been electronically altered. 

00:03:25
MARSHA M. LINEHAN What we’ve got to do, is we have got to figure out a way, you and me, to change this behavior. 

00:03:30
I don’t think I can change. 

00:03:35
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Okay… 

00:03:35
NARRATOR Dialectical behavior therapy, draws from traditional cognitive behavioral models, particularly those that emphasize change oriented strategies. But in developing DBT, Dr. Linehan added an important element. 

00:03:50
MARSHA M. LINEHAN PhD Professor of Psychology University of Washington When you approach people who meet criteria for borderline, with the treatment that focuses exclusively in helping them change, what you find is that the individual is so sensitive, to negative feedback and criticism, that their ability to change, gets reduced and to manage then goes to almost zero, if you come in with what I think it was a technology of change. Well, I know it is going to be really hard… but, between the two of us, we are going to have to do it. Throughout the entire treatment of what I’ve done, is gone to other treatment approaches besides, ah… behavior therapy and looked for what I now think of is a technology of acceptance. And so, what we, I brought in was, acceptance base treatment strategies blended them in with, change base strategies and so the treatment now is really defined as the balance of acceptance in change. 

00:04:55
Goals of Treatment 

00:05:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Let’s see, your boyfriend starts a fight, you lose it, he walks out, you decide it’s over, decide to kill yourself, walk into the bathroom, pick up your pills, take them all… and practically die. 

00:05:25
NARRATOR In DBT, the objective is to address the behavioral characteristics typically found in patients who meet criteria for borderline personality disorder. 

00:05:35
MARSHA M. LINEHAN The treatment itself, is based on the eye on several kind of interrelated source of ideas. The first idea is that, people who meet criteria for borderline have skills deficits or capability deficiency, that they don’t have the ability to gage in the behaviors that they need to dissolve their problems. What I’m thinking is that what we have to do, is teach you something new to do, what do you think? 

00:06:05
I think that would help. 

00:06:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN You willing to learn something new? 

00:06:10
Yeah. 

00:06:10
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Okay. 

00:06:10
I have to. 

00:06:10
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Well, I agree with that. The second is that, the individual even when they have the capabilities often is does not use those capabilities because of motivational factors. So they're inhibited, um… they're being punished for being skillful and rewarded for let's say suicidal behavior for example or they have faulty believes. And so, we have a whole component where the real function of the component is to focus in on motivational factors. 

00:06:40
Well, at home… no one pays any attention to me, people just tell me to shape up. At least in the hospital, people take me seriously. 

00:06:50
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So one of the things that is going on here is that, if you try to kill yourself, or say you’re going to kill yourself that’s… the effect of that, is that, other people take you seriously. 

00:07:00
Yeah. 

00:07:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Okay. 

00:07:00
It’s the only way they take me seriously. 

00:07:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN This of course, is the problem. People take you seriously in the hospital. And being taken seriously is a reinforcer for you. I’m almost sure, it’s a reinforcer for most people. And so, if you get taken seriously everytime you say you’re going to kill yourself, or when you do try to kill yourself, and you don’t get taken seriously any other time, you can count on it, you’re going to keep threatening or keep trying to kill yourself. That’s just the way it works. The third assumption is that the individual, um… needs help taking what they learn within the treatment program and applying it in their everyday world and that there a lot of ah… treatment programs fail because they don’t pay enough attention to getting the behaviors learn in therapy into the real world, where they got to have them. And so we have a component, whose aim is to provide coaching, in use of new behaviors in the everyday environment. And in at least the treatment is that we’ve research today, that is always been done with telephone calls to the individual therapist although one could do that with case management, milieu treatment, lot of other things. 

00:08:20
I don’t see what good learning these skills does. I mean, it's like I’m learning to be the perfect patient, but I still can’t function outside. It’s like I get into a crisis and I still can’t do anything. 

00:08:35
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Well listen, that is the point of the phone calls. The whole point is for you to call me and then I’m going to do some coaching… with you, on the phone. So you can practice the skills… out there. Because I completely agree with you. It doesn’t do any good to be the perfect patient. 

00:08:55
NARRATOR The goals of treatment, then are to bring about both change and acceptance by replacing maladaptive and ineffective behaviors with appropriate and effective ones and to improve the patients motivation to change. 

00:09:10
Modes of Therapy 

00:09:20
NARRATOR In DBT, treatment takes place in several different contexts. These include individual psychotherapy, group skills training, telephone consultation, consultation meetings for therapists as well as ancillary treatments, including pharmacotherapy, inpatient care, day treatment, case management and support groups such as twelve step programs. These different modes of therapy each function in specific ways. For example each patient has an individual psychotherapist who is also the primary therapist for their patient on the DBT treatment team. The role of the individual therapist is to first orient the patient to the therapy and have the patient agree on treatment goals even before therapy begins. 

00:10:10
MARSHA M. LINEHAN You do realize that if you don’t drop out for a year, that really does, if you think about it logically, rule out suicide for a year. 

00:10:20
Logically, yeah. But since when is suicide logical? 

00:10:25
MARSHA M. LINEHAN That’s part of the reason we’re having this conversation is to try to structure our relationship so that it's very clear for both of us. And that way, at least, you will try to cut down on how much you get overwhelmed by not knowing what’s going on with me. 

00:10:40
Right. 

00:10:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Okay? 

00:10:40
Uh huh. 

00:10:45
NARRATOR Then the therapist should target all life threatening behaviors. 

00:10:45
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Now one of my goals that we need to get agreement on, is that kind of independent of what you mood is, that you won’t try to kill yourself again. That to me is, kind of, the most fundamental… mood-related behavior we have to work on. Is that, no matter what your mood is… 

00:11:05
Right. 

00:11:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …you won’t kill yourself, or try to. 

00:11:05
Right. 

00:11:10
NARRATOR Next address problems that affect quality of life, teaching coping skills to use in place of habitual dysfunctional behaviors. 

00:11:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So, one of the tasks, for you and me, would be to figure out a way to get your behavior, and what you do less hooked up with how you feel. 

00:11:25
Right. 

00:11:25
MARSHA M. LINEHAN I think we could deal with it. But I think it’s going to be hell. And the real question is whether you’re willing to go through hell to get where you want to get or not? Now, I figure that’s the question here. 

00:11:35
Well, if it’s going to make me happier, yeah. 

00:11:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN You’re sure? 

00:11:40
Yeah. 

00:11:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Okay. That’s good though. You see, that’s going to be your strength. We’re going to play to that. That’s… that's our friend, this desire to live. You’re going to have to remember that when it gets hard. 

00:11:50
NARRATOR Therapy interfering behaviors by the patient or the therapist, must also be attended too. 

00:12:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN We’ve already talked about suicidal behavior. Now the second, really important thing in psychotherapy, with anyone, and in particular in this therapy, is going to be for you and I to spend whatever amount of time we have to, working on our relationship. And, what… what I mean by that is that we’re going to work on any of your behavior that creates problems in therapy. And, just as important, we’re going to work on any of my behavior. So, if you do something that creates a problem for me or for the therapy, I’ll bring it up, if you don’t bring it up first. But if I do something that creates a problem for you or for the therapy, then you bring it up, if I don’t bring it up first, and then we’ll work on that. Because the whole idea is that you and I, we have to work together well. 

00:12:45
NARRATOR And finally efforts are made to generalize these skills into daily life. 

00:12:50
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Now, you are already ahead of the game. Because you agreed last week not to kill yourself before this week. An here you are… alive. 

00:13:00
Yep. 

00:13:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So you did that. 

00:13:00
Yep. 

00:13:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Was it hard? 

00:13:05
Yeah. 

00:13:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN That’s good. Now we know you can do hard things… 

00:13:10
NARRATOR The heart of individual, Psychotherapy is the application of DBT’s core strategies validating the patients problems, while at the same time trying to teach the patient how to solve those problems. 

00:13:20
MARSHA M. LINEHAN What we're going to focus on completely and feel really bad, what you're going to do some distraction. 

00:13:30
NARRATOR In most therapies, validation involves concepts such as empathy, listening and reflecting back, but in DBT, validation has additional meaning. 

00:13:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN DBT does all of that, but it adds on one thing that, is not as often talked about another treatments, which I call validation in terms of the person and that’s the requirement within every interaction, that the therapist search for the grain of wisdom or the grain of truth in the patients response in the moment, so that’s the response where the therapists is looking for and commenting upon something about with the patient saying that make sense in terms of the present. 

00:14:15
I don’t like myself when I get angry. I don’t like it when I end up attacking a friend of mine. 

00:14:20
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Well, I can sure understand that. I mean, I can understand not liking that. 

00:14:25
I mean, I hated myself for it. 

00:14:30
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Hum… so, you’re hating yourself for getting angry? 

00:14:35
Losing it. Not just… not just getting angry but, really losing it. 

00:14:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Hum… well, I’ve got to agree with you. It sounds like knocking your friend to the ground is losing control. So, you felt out of control when you did it? 

00:14:50
Yeah. 

00:14:55
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Any other feelings that you were having? 

00:14:55
No. 

00:15:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So how did you get from there to strangling yourself? That’s what I don’t understand. 

00:15:05
Because it works. 

00:15:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN For what? 

00:15:05
It makes me feel better. 

00:15:10
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Hum… well, I can see how it does that. It’s kind of like taking a sleeping pill, isn’t it? I mean, it makes you unconscious. 

00:15:15
Yeah. 

00:15:20
MARSHA M. LINEHAN (inaudible ) must construed constantly, by people who try to learn this therapy and thanking that if you ever invalidate behavior you're not doing the treatment, so the idea is not to validate the invalid, should be sort of paternalistic if you did it. The idea is to find the valid. So it's based on the premise that is there and there you can find it and so far, I've been at this for quite some time, I have to say when I’ve looked I have found it. 

00:15:50
NARRATOR In DBT, validating the patients problems is balanced by teaching the patient how to go about solving them. 

00:16:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN And in problem solving is included first the notion of behavioral analysis which is a very in depth, moment to moment, second to second, analysis of the chain of responses that led out to problematic behavior and so it's essentially the therapist trying to make sense with the patient or the patients behavior. 

00:16:20
MARSHA M. LINEHAN You had urges to hurt yourself really starting on Wednesday… huh? 

00:16:25
Uh huh. 

00:16:25
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Do you know what set them off on Wednesday? 

00:16:30
My foot began to hurt. 

00:16:30
MARSHA M. LINEHAN You started having a lot of pain. Now… when did you start having the pain and when did the urge to harm yourself come? 

00:16:40
Same time. 

00:16:45
MARSHA M. LINEHAN They just come at… identical moments? 

00:16:45
Just about. 

00:16:45
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So, how is it that feeling pain set off an urge to pain? Do you know how that goes? How you get from one to the other? 

00:16:55
I believe firmly, that if I had gotten pain medication. When I really needed it, I wouldn’t have even thought of self-harming. 

00:17:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN You know, you are not the first person I’ve ever met where if something hurts and no one will help them they make it hurt more. It’s kind of perverse logic. 

00:17:15
Especially when it doesn’t work. 

00:17:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Let’s imagine for the moment, that you and I are on a raft together out in the middle of the ocean. Our boat has sunk, we’re on the raft. And when the boat sunk your leg got cut really badly. We have no pain medicine. And we’re on this raft together and your leg really hurts. And you ask me for pain medicine and I say, "No." Do you think that you would then have an urge to hurt yourself? Make it worse? 

00:17:45
If you had the pain medicine? 

00:17:45
MARSHA M. LINEHAN No, I don’t have any pain medication. 

00:17:45
No, would be a different situation. 

00:17:50
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Okay, but if I did have the pain medication and I said, "No, we have to… we have to save it and only have one a day." What do you think? 

00:17:55
If that were logical to me I would go along with it. 

00:18:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN You wouldn’t want… you wouldn’t want to hurt yourself? What if I said, "No, cause I don’t want you to be a drug addict?" 

00:18:05
Want me to hurt myself. 

00:18:10
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Okay, so we’ve got this clear. So actually… your hurting yourself is communication behavior. Okay. So what we have to do is to figure out a way for the communication behavior to quit working. 

00:18:25
Why? 

00:18:25
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Because if it… you’re not going to stop doing it until it quits working. Like analyzing that is what we call solution analysis. And solution analysis is the therapist trying to help the patient figure out what they could have done different. So its, its, it's like if you were driving from Seattle to Florida, but you ended up in New York, behavioral analysis is trying to figure out how in the world you ended up in New York? Where did you make the wrong turns and solution analysis is trying to figure out how what you could have done to get to Florida, so that’s… that's basically what it is. You see, what I think is happening is that when you’re in a lot of pain and you feel either not cared about or not taken seriously… invalidated… that’s what sets you up to hurt yourself and also want to die. And that what we need to do is figure out a solution to that problem, so that there are other ways to get out besides hurting yourself or trying to kill yourself. So that’s the main part, ah… then you have to add on to that sort of a commitment to go to Florida, so if you end up in New York, and you figure out how to go to Florida, is not very useful, if you can’t get the person to agree, that the next time they get in the car, they are going to Florida, and so that’s the sort of ending part, so you analyze it, you figure out a solution and you get a commitment at the end. 

00:19:50
NARRATOR At times, Dr. Linehan’s response to the patient may see blunt and somewhat irreverence. 

00:19:55
I have been going through this since I was 11 years old… I’m sick of this shit. Either I need to do this or I need to die. 

00:20:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Uh…huh. 

00:20:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …those are my two choices. 

00:20:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Well, why not die? 

00:20:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Well, if it comes down to it, I will. 

00:20:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Uh…huh. But why not now? 

00:20:05
NARRATOR But this is not a matter of personal style, in fact, it is a planed part of dialectical behavior therapy. 

00:20:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN What DBT says is that a therapist needs to balance their styles, no matter what your personal style is, the irreverence style, ah… it combines in number of things part of it combines just lot of confrontation, bluntness, calling us spade to spade and being direct. And if you try it being very direct to borderline patient should be a mess, because they almost always love it, they almost always tell you they really appreciate it, this is what people tell us all the time. So that’s, um… that’s the… that's the confrontation, that’s part of irreverence. Now the other part of irreverence, is… is hard to describe in words, is the off the wall part of it, it’s the sort of being outrageous, it’s the we don’t exactly sense for everything and it’s the attempt of the therapist to sort of push the patient into some other way of thinking, so it’s a lot of use of paradox, ah… taking small parts or what the patients says may be an exaggerating them or picking up apart that they didn’t want you attending to and attending to it ah… etc. Kind of the most fundamental, mood-related behavior we have to work on is that no matter what your mood is… 

00:21:25
Alright. 

00:21:25
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …you won’t kill yourself, or try to. 

00:21:25
I agree to that. 

00:21:30
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Why would you agree to that? 

00:21:30
I don’t know. 

00:21:30
MARSHA M. LINEHAN I mean, wouldn’t you rather be in a therapy where if you could… if you want to kill yourself you can? 

00:21:40
I don’t know. I’ve never really thought of it that way. 

00:21:45
MARSHA M. LINEHAN That though can very easily become mean(ph) spirited, would be use against patient, be sarcastic and be used to justify no end to troublesome behaviors. So balancing that, is what I call reciprocal communication and um… reciprocal communication and… also has a lot of parts to it, but the main part of reciprocal communication, is an emphasis first on warmth and genuineness. Um… and responsivity of the therapist, so it's much like being vulnerable, which also a lot of other therapist have talked about interestingly, Yung(ph) talked a lot about, the necessity of the therapist being vulnerable. And being vulnerable means that you have to be touchable, you have to be pushable, you have to be movable. If… the patient has to be able to influence you, by what they do. I not only how you come on this, its… it's intuitive or something rather… 

00:22:40
NARRATOR Being irreverence is not easy to accomplish, such a direct style may not need be part of the therapists training or personality. 

00:22:50
MARSHA M. LINEHAN I tell teams all the time, that the way to learn a irreverence, if you not a irreverence, is to find the person in your group who is naturally irreverence, because there is always somebody whose this way by birth. And whoever it is then you listen to every irreverence thing they said and you have to get them to tell you all their irreverence stuff and then you imitate them. 

00:23:10
I like the style of DBT. I think I have to work at it, some its… it's irreverence is something that will take um… a lot being able to relax with people. I think that takes a certain confidence that I’m still building um… in doing therapy with people but I think that it will open up for me a lot of room to be more of who I'm, because I find myself being that way, more with um… people naturally and… and I think it opens up a lot of freedom to move with… with patients, they didn’t like that I had so much before. 

00:23:45
You're dancing with your client the whole time and so um… it… it keeps you real focused, see you know… you know when you are on one side of the dialectic that quickly you're going to be moving and so, intellectually it's, you know it's very satisfying. Um… and… and its fun, I mean it’s a fun thing to do. 

00:24:00
Group Skills Training 

00:24:05
NARRATOR Individual therapy focuses on motivational issues, however group sessions are used to enhance social capabilities through psycho educational skills training. 

00:24:10
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Basically what… 

00:24:15
Like times, I could get some like anxious about something that… 

00:24:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Hmm…hmm. 

00:24:20
Ah… you know I just blank out or something you know… 

00:24:20
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Hmm…hmm. 

00:24:20
…that point of feeling confidence seemed almost like ah… 

00:24:25
MARSHA M. LINEHAN It seems like the hardest thing to do, yeah. 

00:24:30
Yeah, I mean… 

00:24:30
MARSHA M. LINEHAN That might be something that you need to practice more… 

00:24:30
NARRATOR The goal of skills training is to replace the negative emotions, beliefs and behaviors associated with borderline personality disorder with positive ones. Because skills training is difficult to do within the framework of individual therapy, patients are required to attend these group sessions as well. Within the DBT protocol, two types of skills are taught. 

00:24:55
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Over and over and over, because it really… The formal skills are divided into two sets of skill, the first of what I’d think of is the acceptance skills and the second I work with all the change skills. So the acceptance skills are also divided into two sets, the first part is the mind from the skills, which are really skills that have to do with being able to learning how to focus your mind, in the moment that you’re in. So it's it can be thought of its radical acceptance at the moment and mind fullness of the moment. 

00:25:25
NARRATOR Mindfulness skills encourage patients to balance a rational reaction to a situation within a emotional one. A state called wise mind. 

00:25:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN M, is mindful, which means that you want to stay focused on… 

00:25:45
Mindfulness Skills 

00:25:45
NARRATOR When successfully practiced and integrated mindfulness skills, help decrease identity confusion, feelings of emptiness and cognitive dysregulation. 

00:25:55
MARSHA M. LINEHAN And the second set of skills, that are also acceptance based are distressed tolerance skills. And these are skills that have to do with in a fact how to get through a crisis, ah… or tragedy they can’t be made better. When you can’t make yourself like it, but you got to survive it anyway, so there are crisis survival strategies. 

00:26:20
NARRATOR Distress tolerance skills teach patients who are in pain to distract, self sooth(ph) to make attempts to improve the moment and evaluate the pros and cons of the situations and the response. 

00:26:30
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So, you were thinking if you hurt yourself, they would somehow give you pain medicine. 

00:26:35
If they wouldn’t listen to me, then I could show them. 

00:26:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Okay, you were thinking that. 

00:26:40
Hmm…hmm. 

00:26:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN "That if they won’t listen to me I will show them." Okay, so why didn’t you do it right then? 

00:26:50
Didn’t want to make it worse. 

00:26:50
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So you were thinking about what? You were thinking about pros and cons –"If I make it worse I’ll feel worse?" Okay, that’s good thinking. That is when you are thinking that… thinking about the advantages and disadvantages of doing it. 

00:27:05
Hmm…hmm. 

00:27:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Okay. 

00:27:05
Distress Tolerance Skills 

00:27:05
NARRATOR When properly implemented, distress tolerance skills help decrease impulsive behaviors, suicide threats and self injury. 

00:27:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So most of the two acceptance based skills and most of the ones that are most different from behavioral therapy is those two sets. Now the other two sets are sort of standard behavior therapy skills that are in many behavior therapy programs and so there is nothing too unique about them. The first is interpersonal effectiveness skills, which is in effect how to be effective in conflict situations in particular how to get way you want when you are asking for something and how to make your nose stick when you're trying to stay now, how to stand up for yourself, asking and saying no. I’d like, for you to think of some situations in your own lives that we can practice with. 

00:27:55
DEARMAN 

00:28:00
NARRATOR This skills training group includes both family members and patients, they will be practicing an interpersonal effectiveness skill called Dearman, this exercise is adapted from a similar one developed by Bowers and Bowers of Stanford university. Each letter serves as a reminder of the target behavior that patients are taught. These are… describe the current situation. Express feelings and opinions. Assert by asking or saying no. Reinforce the person ahead of time. Be mindful of objectives without distraction. Appear effective and competent and negotiate alternate solutions. 

00:28:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN What I want is for Kim to ask and you to try to respond but we’re also going to looking that necessarily to solve the problem but also to look at afterwards, how you felt about the way she phrased it and Kim how you felt with, how he responded. 

00:28:50
KIM It seems to me that you been awfully interested in like things that I’m doing in my day program and the people what I’m hanging out with and the people that I’m dating, if I’m dating um… every little thing that I do and um… you keep asking me questions and I understand that um… maybe you're… you're interested in… in my well being and I really do appreciate it, um… but I really feel overwhelmed. 

00:29:20
Interpersonal Skills Emotion Regulation Skills 

00:29:20
NARRATOR Improving interpersonal skills helps decrease feelings such as interpersonal chaos and fears of abandonment. The second set of change skills are called emotion regulation skills, regulating emotions allows patients to decrease feelings of anger, fear, shame and sadness. 

00:29:40
KIM One of the reasons why… 

00:29:40
NARRATOR Again the aim of group skills training is to meet specific behavioral deficits associated with borderline personality disorder and replace them with positive beliefs and behaviors that will help patients learn to solve their own problems. 

00:29:55
KIM Even though I knew this was just role play I started really feeling like oh no… you know I really can’t do this on my own, I really do need to depend on mummy and daddy, these are my parents. Oh! no disastrous. 

00:30:10
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So what makes you back, because you didn’t react that way. 

00:30:15
KIM Well, if you know what it was… it was… it was focusing you know when I was doing. Well, I was trying to get across… 

00:30:20
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Being mindful? 

00:30:25
KIM Being mindful. 

00:30:25
Great. 

00:30:25
NARRATOR These and several other psycho educational skills are described in more detail in this training manual, written by Dr. Linehan, the manual also contains worksheets, suitable for reproduction and distribution. Treating patients with borderline personality disorder, can be a difficult and often frustrating experience for therapists. 

00:30:45
Consultation Meetings for Therapists 

00:30:50
And Wednesday she missed my session didn’t call, which is unusual for her, didn’t return my call um… until I reached her next morning lied about why she didn’t make it. 

00:30:55
She’s now missing in action again and has been since I guess Friday night, which is her pattern and this is so consistent pattern I'm working, Monday through Friday, she’s like got a parent competence down, I mean she is just amazing. 

00:31:10
She has spent more years fooling doctor and I have been a doctor and she done it as life and death issue every day, I’m not that good. 

00:31:20
NARRATOR To help therapists, cope with these patients, DBT takes a team approach, just as there was consultation to the patient by therapists, there was also consultation to therapists by a team of colleagues. 

00:31:35
MARSHA M. LINEHAN The consultation to the team is based on the notion, that the relationship between the patient and the therapist is reciprocal one and that the patients behavior can have a very important influence on the therapist behavior and that what often goes on, in treating borderline patients in particular and possibly many difficult to treat populations. Is that the patient often inadvertently reinforces the therapist for doing essentially ineffective treatment and punishes the therapist for doing effective things and that what happens overtime is that the therapist slides from a treatment that might have been effective, if they had stuck with that. To one that progressive will becomes less and less effective over the time, because of this reciprocal interaction. 

00:32:25
When I went through my um… most difficult session today with my patient, you know what and I knew the right thing was to call, like this is where I need the team to treat me, so that I can figure out… 

00:32:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Hmm…hmm. 

00:32:40
…how to treat my patient. I think I had a system like that in place that would have been easier for me to at least may contact with that person, the part of what I was going through with like shame, humiliation all other stuff that like… 

00:32:55
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So the goal of the treatment team is to consult with the therapist and provide a balance to the patient and a balance that will keep the therapist within the treatment frame. So the goal of the treatment team is to reinforce the therapist and support the therapist in doing effective treatment and help give them feedback when they're doing ineffective treatment. And at the same time, to apply all of the DBT’s treatment strategies to the therapist. So what they do, what the treatment team has to do is a balance validation of the therapist. So the therapist comes in ready to call the patient and that treatment team says well of course how could you feel otherwise, that’s the validation part and then the change part is the problem solving but what are we going to about it, because that… that attitude is probably going to be harmful in a long way, so that’s what that team does and it’s a weekly meeting, is become so important in this treatment, that I now believe that it's an essential part of the treatment. It's this if I free to find what I think treatment is, I used to think it was a relationship between a therapist and a patient or a therapist in a patient group. And I now think that is the relationship between the patient and the therapist and a relationship between the therapist and the team or system and is that whole circle that’s the dreamer(ph). So the goal of the treatment team is to consult with the therapist and provide a balance to the patient and a balance that will keep the therapist within the treatment frame. 

00:34:35
My experience in working with borderline as a case manager was that though there were people around I felt very much that I was doing the work on my own. And… and I think that where I’ll be able to get from the team is, is ah… much more ability to be able to live with this sort of issues, that borderlines present on a… on a daily basis. 

00:34:55
MARSHA M. LINEHAN The fact that mental health practitioners are really supporting me and I internally supporting them and that we don’t have to look for um… that affirmation from our clients, you know is that we’re working together on this and we know that there is somebody they're supporting. So you don’t have to feel so alone dealing with your client. 

00:35:20
Outcome Data 

00:35:25
NARRATOR The goal of dialectical behavior therapy is to help people with borderline personality disorder to find hope and forge a life lesson countered by emotional chaos, but how effective has DBT been in treating these patients. 

00:35:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN There are lot of ideas that people have about, how to treat these patients. What this treatment has going for it at the moment which… which others may have before long, but at the moment is the only one that’s got this going for is as controlled clinical trial data, demonstrating its effective. 

00:36:05
NARRATOR Dr. Linehan, conducted a one year study of DBT, treating 24 women with the history of suicide attempts and self injury. These were compared to a control group of 23 similar women, who received standard treatment. The number of self-injury attempts among the DBT group was nearly half of the control group. And the number of hospital admissions over the same period show that again there were half as many from the DBT group as the control. However, despite these improvements in outcome, Dr. Linehan does not consider DBT to be a cure for borderline personality disorder. 

00:36:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN I think we have to be completely clear about something which is the stream is not very good. It’s the best, but it's not good, we don’t know how to treat these people well. What we can do with this treatment is as much as we can do but we simply got to do better than what we’re doing and this treatments got to get better and this is why I am fundamentally a researcher rather than a practitioner, is because someone is got to stay in home and try to make this thing better. And so that’s really what I’m doing is I’m continuing the research trying to improve it and hopefully, it’ll keep improving and many people who apply it are going to make it better and (inaudible ) going to make it better and manage care is going to make it better and hospitals going to make it better in other words I think everyone who uses that, probably will be able to contribute and make this treatment better. 

00:37:30
ALLEN FRANCES , MD Duke University For most clinicians, for most family members, for most people with these problems, that the most devastating and… and terrifying aspect of life is the risk of suicidal or self mutilation, um… that’s your primary step, your first go tell us, what you did? 

00:37:45
MARSHA M. LINEHAN The first thing, that I think you have to do, is that you have to recognize that, if suicidal people could manage their lives and makes them bearable in some other way, surely they would do that. 

00:38:00
ALLEN FRANCES Hmm…hmm. 

00:38:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So you have to assume that they in fact can’t do something else, that would work. 

00:38:10
ALLEN FRANCES Hmm…hmm. 

00:38:10
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So the first thing you have to do, is you have to improve their capabilities. 

00:38:15
ALLEN FRANCES How does one, use what you teach in workshops on this tape in your… in your books. How does one use that in everyday… everyday practice with the next patient? If one doesn’t have the whole team and doesn’t have the total experience in applying treatment. 

00:38:30
MARSHA M. LINEHAN I don’t know, I'd probably respond to that by saying you take which you can get… 

00:38:35
ALLEN FRANCES Hmm…hmm. 

00:38:35
MARSHA M. LINEHAN I mean you take which you can take. I mean obviously if you can’t do the whole thing you have to take what you can take and you take whatever seems reasonable or whatever you think it's going to fit into your practice. It’s… it's a long term question and we have to do a lot more work in research to find out how much of it do you have to get, to get the same resource that we got in our research… 

00:38:55
ALLEN FRANCES Hmm…hmm. 

00:38:55
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …that research hasn't been done, my personal belief from doing the training that I done around the country is that almost everybody can take, almost all of it. 

00:39:05
ALLEN FRANCES Hmm…hmm. 

00:39:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Because what most people don’t realize um… and tell after they’ve learned it is that before they learn the treatment they were almost everybody is doing 80% of it. 

00:39:15
ALLEN FRANCES Hmm…hmm. 

00:39:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN It's not as if this is like entirely new thing. 

00:39:15
ALLEN FRANCES Hmm…hmm. 

00:39:20
MARSHA M. LINEHAN If it was, I’m sure no one would like it, it will be too way out. But 80… everyone’s doing 80% so most people only have to learn 20% anyway. 

00:39:25
ALLEN FRANCES Hmm…hmm. 

00:39:30
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …and so it's just that the 20%, one person learns is different than the 20% another person learns. So you need to find the 20% that’s not your 20% see if you like and put it in. 

00:39:40
ALLEN FRANCES Lots of times that, the individual person or the family loses hope, sometimes the therapist or even the treatment team loses hope. The um… the lower end prospects from those people are pretty good, how do we somehow rather get people through rough patches that um… so often make it difficult when we’re seeing them. 

00:40:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN If the patient loses hope or the family and the therapists contact obviously with the patient, but if they also do with the family. The main thing is for the therapist to cheerlead. 

00:40:15
ALLEN FRANCES Hmm…hmm. 

00:40:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So the therapist… 

00:40:15
ALLEN FRANCES Hmm…hmm. 

00:40:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …believes and the therapist continues to encourage… 

00:40:15
ALLEN FRANCES Hmm…hmm. 

00:40:20
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …and pushes, controls, carries, drags etcetera. So then the problem is what happens if the patient loses hope and the therapist loses hope and that's where this idea of a treatment team comes in perhaps we got to be clear what I mean by treatment team, what I really mean by it at this most minimal level is simply another person whose is a professional therapist also… 

00:40:40
ALLEN FRANCES Hmm…hmm. 

00:40:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …so my idea is that every therapist who treats the very severely disordered person needs one pure colleague that they consult with. And the collogue re-moralize as so as we that’s part of their task. 

00:40:55
ALLEN FRANCES Hmm…hmm. 

00:40:55
MARSHA M. LINEHAN You re-moralize for them, they re-moralize for you. They carry a magnifying glass and they're looking with their magnifying glass trying to find… 

00:41:05
ALLEN FRANCES Where is the hope? 

00:41:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …the progress. Exactly, that you miss that way. And it can be a one person in my research is been a team of about six in Community Mental Health Centers is usually, you know whatever the team is. And the goal, one of the main task that they have is to carry a magnifying glass. And put it up, when you talked to them. 

00:41:25
ALLEN FRANCES There’s always hope if you can just look hard in effort? 

00:41:30
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Well I don’t even know if there’s always hope, the question is what’s the option? Whether it's hope or not, there’s got to be help. 

00:41:40
