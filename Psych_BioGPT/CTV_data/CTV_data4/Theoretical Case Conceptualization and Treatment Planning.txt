PATRICIA ROBEY Hi, my name is Dr. Patricia Robey, and I'm an Associate Professor in the counseling program of Governors State University. And now we're going to talk about theoretical case conceptualization and treatment planning. So, so far we've talked a lot about theory, models of theory, umm… ways to think about working with your clients, and now we're ready to rock and roll. Because this is when everything that we've talked about, everything that we've learned so for, comes to the real world and how we apply what we're thinking to what's going on with our clients. So first of all, what is case conceptualization? That's a report. That's based on information gathered, organized and assessed to provide an explanation of a client's behavior, where we look for emotional, stated, non-verbal, and behavioral information that helps us to develop a picture of the client's experience that leads to collaboration with the client and goals for change. Okay. So what does that mean? So basically, what this is, is we're creating from the information that we know in advance from our theory to what we learned about the client, from the client to create the client's theory of themselves. So it becomes really interesting now because in this way, the theory guides, umm… how we gather information. For example, if you work from a cognitive approach, you focus a lot on what the client is thinking. If you work from a behavioral approach, you would look at the client's actions. Uh, from a psychodynamic approach, you would look at the client's childhood. So all of these things that you know, uh, come into play when you meet with the client. So, umm… theory explains in general, what you understand about the client and case conceptualization explains a specific client. So that's what makes a difference. So now you're putting everything into action to understand what's in front of you for an individual client. And you should know that case conceptualization is not diagnosis, it really is creating a much larger picture of what you can understand from looking at the client. So in this segment what I'm going to do is, I'm going to talk about what case conceptualization includes, but then I'm going to go through a case study, so that you can see how I conceptualize the case and understand it through my theoretical approach which is choice theory, with the reality therapy, as the model of putting it into action. So we're gonna do a little bit of information then talk to you about application. And so I encourage you when you're listening, to think about how this would apply to you. So because that's the essence of it. So if you think about your own cases and how you would understand what's going through, you can follow along with me with choice theory, you might have some ideas that peak your own interest in your own way of thinking about what's going on with you, or your family, your friends, yourself, okay. All right. So the process of case conceptualization is pretty much a standard cut-and-dried kind of thing, just like in any approach to working with people. The first thing that you want to do is you want to find out about the client's story and the presenting problem. So this is where you get information about the client. How the client understands his or her world? This is a critical piece because if you don't spend time upfront getting to know the client through gathering this information, you can lose the client pretty quickly. I think that, umm… it's one of the challenges that we have as professionals in the counseling field that the expectation is that we gather information on… often on an assessment form because that's what agencies tell us to do. Because they're interested in turning that around and getting it to insurance or whatever else as soon as possible, and so to be able to integrate that assessment conversation into relationship building, is tricky some times. And when you call you might tell your clients we're gonna spend some time upfront just getting to know some detailed information about you. Uh, it helps to bridge that gap. But even so, I know I had a friend who went in for counseling one time, and she was so put off because the counselor pulls out a pad of paper and a pencil and starts just asking her questions and talks about fees and all those kind of things. And meanwhile, my friend was just aching to tell her story. And so this is where we really struggle with that idea of how we gather information at the same time, as being collaborative and connecting with the client. Nothing, I think is worse than having a bunch of papers in front of your face and doing this kind of thing with the client. So, uh, ideally, when you're thinking about gathering information with the client, you should know what information you're looking for and have those forms memorized, so that when your client is coming in, you can have that conversation. Tell me a little bit about yourself, tell me about your family. While meanwhile you're gathering data about family for the assessment, but you're doing it in a real collaborative way. So this is kind of the skill around gathering assessment data upfront. This goes to obtaining demographic information. I mean, think about how different that is, how old are you, when were you born, where do you live that kind of thing as opposed to. Oh, tell me about your neighborhood. Where are you, that kind of thing? Just see how you can, uh, modify it, so that you gain the same information, but you do it in a way that's connecting. And this is really an interesting piece when you start explore the social, historical, and cultural context. This is so important to getting the big picture of the client. And so while you're doing that, you can understand that it's for assessment purposes, but also has the purpose of clarifying that bigger picture. Umm… one of things that's important from a counseling perspective is that we look at couns… the counselees from a wellness perspective. So that's why we're always looking at their strengths and their coping skills. I really like this aspect of being your counselor because when you think about it, people come in and they're often not aware that they have any skills that are gonna help them move forward. When I… when I used to counsel clients, in their first session, I always ask them, what are the strengths that you have that are gonna help you, get through this difficult time. And it's really an interesting… It's an interesting question, I think, but more interesting is the fact that most clients don't have things at their fingers tips related to strengths. What they come in with is the perception of the areas of deficit that they have, the problems that they have, and they don't have an idea about the coping skills that they have, the strengths that they have and so to be able to identify that and act on that is really meaningful. And I'm a counselor who… I'm experiential and I like to put things in writing, I like to give things to clients so that they can take it with them. So when clients are telling me about their strengths, I write them down. If they have a hard time starting, I could say, well, one of the things I've noticed about you is or what would you friend say about you, so that you can add to it. And at the end of the session, I give them the copy of those strengths. I use that outside of counseling too, when my daughter was, uh, she was going for an interview for a doctoral program at the University of Illinois, Chicago. And I said, when they ask you, why do you deserve to have a position in this doctoral program, what are you gonna say? And she was like, I don't know, I never thought of that. So on the way over there, I had her writing down her strengths and so I said, when you go in there and this is what I say to a client, when you take this list, fold it up, put it in your pocket, put it in your purse, or wherever. And when you're feeling those vulnerable times, put your hand on your pocket, take it out of your purse, whatever. And it's a reminder, it's a tangible reminder of the things that you've got going on, that's going to help you get through or make you deserve the doctoral program. My daughter did get in their doctoral program, by the way. Umm… but, uh, but the idea is strength building and that focus on strength and wellness which is really a critically important piece for us. Okay, of course, you want to asses for risk, and create a problem list, so you got a problem list, you know, what needs to addressed. In my experience, this has been so interesting, assessing for risk and you know what that means, right? That means asking a client if they're at danger of harm to self or others. And it's the one question I noticed that tends to kind of be pushed off, by beginning counselors in training. And I… Sure, you can imagine why that is because people are afraid that they gonna hear an answer that they are not looking forward to hearing. And so it's really imp… and that is that the client is feeling suicidal because then you have to take some action, right? And so, we work then in training to practice assessing for risk before you're actually in the session. I often think that the practice sessions that we do in the beginning counseling skills course and in beginning practicum is like the driver's ed for counseling because you want to practice it in the parking lot, in the classroom before you actually take it on the road with clients. And so to familiarize yourself then with, how you're going to ask those risk assessment questions, what are you going to do if you find out that the client is suicidal? What are the next steps to take? Those are the things if you kind of create that repertoire behaviors in your mind, it's going to help you when they come up. And if you think it might… It's probably not gonna come up where you are, you're probably kidding yourself. Umm… I find it very interesting that we tend to get what we need from our clients. You know if there is an area that we need to be working on. Sure enough that's got a walk in the door. It's an amazing thing. The thing that you're most afraid of is likely to happen. So it's good to get those things out of the way first. And then the other piece of assessing is that you can't just assess once and then call it a day. Or you can't just, uh, say that the client did not give any indication of risk because that's a non-event. You have to ask the question. And if you see any evidence that there is sliding in that direction, you have to be able to ask, and know what to do. Okay, so then the other thing is a diagnosis. Now I told you case conceptualization is not a diagnosis in itself, but there is a diagnostic component to it, and we'll talk about that later. Then finally, here's where it starts to get fun, now you apply your theoretical orientation, you hypothesize about the nature of the problem. You develop your goals and then you plan interventions. So that's kind of the overall format for case conceptualization. And so now how do we apply theory to them. Okay, so as we talked about before, theory helps you know how to understand your client. What patterns of thinking actions and feelings need to be addressed and how does theory inform your goals for counseling? So those are some of the things that you are thinking about. So rather than just talk about it from a conceptual point, I'm going to talk about it through the lens of an actual client, a composite of clients, as we wouldn't talk about a client specifically. Umm… so this is about Susan, she was an 18-year-old student in her first year at a local university, not here. And she requested counseling because her mother insisted that something was wrong and she needed help. She reported that three of her friends had been killed in an accident and she should have been with them. She always had a hard time making friends and now feels disconnected, alone, and has lost interest in things she used to enjoy. So this was umm… a very interesting and, and meaningful case, for me, personally. I felt very strongly, umm… connected to this client. When she came in, umm… it was, it was in winter, but even so she, she was very bundled up and she never unbundled. You know she kept her coat on, she had a hat pulled low over her face. And she didn't want to take that off. And as you think about what's going on and understanding that and thinking about the fact that her mom had told her to come to counseling, it kind of shows that she was keeping this as a barrier, right? A protective kind of way of being covered, keeping her, her eyes was actually hooded and so when I want to greet her, I actually had to kind of look under here. And, uh, look at her and make that connection. So she was very reluctant to come to counseling. Umm… and it was really interesting because when I asked you why she was there, she said because her mother sent here. So you could say, well, she was mandated client. She didn't want to come. Although from my theoretical perspective, what I understand is that even though her mother told her to come, she chose to come, right? Choice theory is my approach. But the truth of the matter is she could have done a lot of different things and didn't, you know, chose to not to come. And so that's okay. So then I knew that in spite of the fact that she was referred to counseling by her mom, the reason that she came is because she wanted to get something for herself. And for me, the trick was going to be, how do I discover what that is and how do we move forward. Okay, so from a choice theory perspective, what I know about clients before they're coming in. The primary thing is that most enduring issues, that is long lasting issues, are related to relationship problems. So when clients come in to me, what I know is that they have problems with relationships and significant relationships in their lives. And if you think about the people that you know, probably you could… the people that you know who are having long lasting problems and you think about it, you could probably see that a lot of them have difficulties with other relationships in their lives. And part of that is because of the way that they interact with other people because they attempt to control people through the behaviors that they use. They try to make other people change instead of themselves. Umm… and they just have that disconnect, they don't have good social skills whatever. But the other piece that I have found in my work with clients that I think is critically important is that primarily the relationship problem seems to start with relationship with self. So if you've worked with clients or, you know, friends or whatever who have problems and you think about how they would describe themselves, very often what you'll hear is I have low self-esteem. And that tells you that the clients perception of self, is in that area where they don't feel that they are good enough, whatever else it is, that they are not living up to their expectations for themselves. And there is lots of ways that they come to that conclusion. But if I don't have a good relationship with myself first and I'm relying on somebody else to fill that gap from outside, I might be pretty disappointed. Can you imagine? Because if you are relying on somebody else to fill that, that gap, it's likely that you are going to be, umm… waiting for a long time. You have to be able to develop that on yourself. So my theory also says that clients are internally motivated to meet five basic needs. The need for power, that's personal, empower a sense of importance, love and belonging, freedom, fun and survival. And all of those instead of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, Glassers needs are unique to the individuals, so some people would have a higher need for love and belonging then other. Some people have a high need for power and achievement. Some people have high need for fun or freedom and survival, you would think might be the top of the line, but it isn't necessarily. Because some people, in order to have fun and freedom, will risk their survival, right? If you know anybody who's gone skydiving or doing some of those things you can see where they're, they need for fun and freedom, over rides their safety needs. So what I know when my client came in is that she had those basic needs and one or more of those basic needs wasn't getting satisfied. And so given the fact that she had lost three of her friends in that accident and she was having difficulty making new relationships. You could see where her ability to meet her need for love and belonging was not being met. In addition to the other needs associated with that, she wasn't having much fun. She didn't feel like she had a lot of choices. She didn't feel good about herself so even her idea of personal power or self-efficacy was minimized. So I can see that a lot of her needs weren't being met, by the behaviors that she was choosing. Okay, so needs are met through very specific people, places, things believe in what are called the clients quality well pictures. So for my client what I knew is that the way that she was getting her needs met very specifically from the relationships with those three people who had died. So imagine that if this is the picture that you have, that this is the way that I get my love and belonging need met and that's… Absolutely gone. I mean, there is no way of getting that back, that's gone, but I still want that so much. Imagine that sense of incongruence. You know, what I really want just for these people to be in my life and to have friends and good relationships. And what I perceive is that they're gone forever, that mismatch creates that painful perception of what's lacking in life, right? So that's how that works. So just… I mean, there's many more things in her quality world that she wasn't getting met, but that primarily was the one presenting issue. And then the other piece of that was with those being gone then what replaces that. What's the picture in the quality world that can start to, to rebuild that? And one of the things that I know then is that if she's not getting that need met, what I can do is to offer some information to her about how she can get that need met. How she can act, add people in her quality world, how she can start to feel better about herself and create a picture of herself in her quality world. So that she can start to have a better relationship with self, okay? I hope you're with me. Okay, so the thing is that, uh, choice theory and reality therapy is somewhat along the line of a cognitive behavioral approach, although the theory to it is different than the cognitive behavioral theory. But the way they are similar is that from a choice theory, reality therapy perspective, we work on what the client does, their action and what they think because that's the primary way that you can make change. And we talk about behaviors having four components acting, thinking, feeling and physiology. And if you think about it you've got all of those things going on for you right now. You're thinking about something I can see your actions, you're sitting in chairs, some of you are nodding, you're feeling something may be umm… I'm tired, I'm, I'm ready to go. Is this gonna go on forever, we are gonna get a break, you know. And of course, you've got physiological component that's associated with what's going on now. I've been sitting in this chair for sometime, I'm getting sore, I'm getting tired and so on. So, uh, but what we can directly change is your acting and your thinking and once we change that then feeling and physiology will come along with it. Okay. Your behavior is learned, you choose your behavior even though it doesn't seem like you choose it, but it's learned and it's kind of the thing that you over the course of time. And it could be effective or ineffective. So, umm… the other thing that I love… This is my favorite thing about choice theory, is the concept that all behavior is purposeful. It's the client's best effort to satisfy their needs. So when I… Remember, I talked about Virginia Satir and she felt like she was a detective. Well, that's how I feel when I think about this concept of the purpose of behavior. People do things that are strange and don't seem to make sense to us, right? I mean, I'm sure you've all seen that, but when I see that in session or when I see that with my family or even if I think about that with myself and I wonder what the heck am I doing and why… then I think all behaviors are purposeful, okay. But the thing is when I'm thinking about a client thinking through that that lens of all behavior is purposeful to act on the world, to get what we want which satisfies one or more of the basic needs. I think about how is that behavior serving the client? And it's so interesting even to ask a client that because clients don't believe that their behavior is helping if they thought it was helping then they wouldn't be here for counseling. But in some way it helps. So for example, this client, her behavior was going to her room every night, you know, being alone and isolated, umm… staying quiet, avoiding things going on in the world and you think, well, that's not really working for her. On the other hand, it worked because it served the purpose of protecting her from risking rejection by going out and trying to meet new friends. It served a purpose because while she was hiding out from the world, guess what, her mom would go in and try and comfort her and draw her out. So if my client gave up on that behavior, then she has to do something different and meanwhile, what she needed was that connection with her mom, that safety, that quiet place. And so you see in a, in a strange way, the purposefulness of behavior even though it wasn't the most effective thing she could have chosen, it did work just enough for her to maintain that behavior over time. And that's what she had done. The problem came for her when mom said this is enough, this is too much. You really need to stop this and, you know, there's usually some sort of catalyst that, you know, propels people to coming into counseling, something that happens. And so that's what happened. But always when I'm thinking about clients, I think about what's the purpose of their behavior, how is this working for them? And if I know that, then I can help the client get that behavior met in a different way. Okay, so if I know that the client is trying to have safety and that the client wants to be comforted. We can have that happen in counseling, right? We could provide that comfort and I can help her to find ways to be safe while she goes out to try and develop new friendships and so on. Okay, and so this is kind of the theory in a visual form. Dr. Glasser talks about behaviors, total behavior. And you see what I was talking about here. So this is the behavioral car. So if you think about this way or talk about, uh, learning theory in the parking lot, right? So it's kind of a, a good comparison. So the front wheels of the car are your actions and your thinking, and then the back wheels are feeling and physiology. And we drive our car in an effort, we're steering toward our wants, which is powered by our basic needs. So all of our behavior is motivated, so we drive our behavior in an effort to get our needs met. And if you think about when you drive a car, that's why they are on front wheels, right? You turn the front wheels you turn… you can control your acting and thinking, but your feeling in physiology just come right along with that, right? So if my client changes what she's doing, changes what she's thinking, she's likely to feel different and her physiology is gonna change, too. And just as an example that everyone kind of understands about this, you can think about things that you do physically that changes all of these behaviors. So, uh, my daughter, for example, is a runner and when she was actually… She had a very serious illness and she was actually thinking she wouldn't survive this. And she was spending a lot time just sitting in her room, same like my client and feeling very depressed. And then what happened is she went to a helping professional who gave her some new information to think about and she started to make some changes in her life. Dieting and exercises which influenced her physiology and then she started to feel better and eventually what happened is she started to feel so much better that she started going out for walks and she was exercising and she's running, and now she's running half marathons. She's remarkable. So just by the way of having that helping professional which is where we come in, right? And to help her to change what she was thinking and what she was doing made a significant impact on her life. But if she didn't have that context of relationship, it would've been very difficult for her to do, and the family couldn't do it for her. Sometimes you have to go outside the family because the family is, you know, kind of huddling her in and keeping her safe even from herself because everybody was worried. So that's the, that's the way that works. Okay? Our behavior is total behavior, so you can't separate these things that are happening all the same, all at the same time and our behavior is chosen. Again, whether you realize it or not, you learn behaviors over time and you have go-to behaviors. So for example, if you've ever lost your keys, you go to look at for them in place that they should be because that's where they usually are, that's a learned behavior till you keep looking somewhere else. And still have you ever done that, where you are look for your keys and then you got to look for them again even though you haven't found them there, that's a good example of behavior, that's learned and chosen over time. Okay, so we've talked about the theoretical basis. So once we know that, so then we have to… The interventions are number one focus on resolving relationship issues with self and with others because the relation problems are the source of most long term problems. So when, umm… when Susan came in to counseling then, umm… what I worked with her on was trying to help her to develop a new relationship with herself. Because she really was feeling, she was thinking I should start with the thinking, she was thinking, I've got nothing to offer in a relationship with my friends. The friends that she had had been friends since she was in grade school. So those long term relationships, where the acceptance was there, she was a freshman at a university, right? And if you know what that's like, she had right to go into a new environment where you don't know people. It's very intimidating. She was thinking that she wouldn't be successful there, umm… this school was really big, so how am I going to create new friends? All of these thoughts that she had was influencing then her actions. And she decided then to stay put in her room and hide out. So the first thing that I wanted to do is to number one, start moving her in the direction of finding friends at school, but also to start looking at herself and what does she have to offer. And that goes back to that strength based, right? So in the first session as usual I asked her to develop that list of strengths, what do you got going on and she was, you know, just a couple of things and I said, well, here's some things that I noticed about her. And the other thing that was very interesting about her was that she umm… was artistically expressive. And I knew this because she had tattoos. And I never thought too much before I met her about the importance of tattoos and what that meant. But when I was asking her about herself and getting to know her and getting to know how she thought. Umm… I asked her about the tattoos and the tattoos actually told her story about her grief and she had a, a bunch of them. And then it turned out that she used her art to, uh, tell her tale. And so through that artistic expression, I learned about her and I said, well, what does this say to you about your strengths, what's important to you and what you have to offer to other people. And so it turned out that that was a great way for her to make connections with others because she was able then to identify, well, one of my strengths is my artistic skills. And she would bring in her art work and she would show me and we would talk through the art. So that we would get to know and then, you know, I could see her starting to develop a different picture about her worth and about her value. And so we started working primarily on getting herself to understand her own, her own self worth that way. Okay, we started by establishing the caring and supportive relationship like we do everywhere. And so then part of the other piece that we do is that we educate. We've talked about this little bit before. It's really important to give clients the skills that they need to have in order to be productive without you. We don't want to be… in, in choice theory, umm… it's somewhat of a brief therapy because the idea is give clients the skills so that they can go out and be okay. In fact, at the end of therapy, we might stretch out the time in between sessions, so that, you know, people can go out, try things, come back, see how it goes. So we would educate other basic needs and have them consider in their lives. This is kind of the structure for thinking what are you doing, or what do you want first, what are doing to get what you want, is it working and then this helps the client to evaluate, develop more quality world pictures. Because remember the idea was, her pictures were very limited about herself in relation to friends. And so she needed to figure out number one, develop a quality world picture of herself in the way that she knew she was worth being a friend. And then to add some more ideas in that world about how she could connect, so we added ideas about, umm… art classes, we added ideas about activities that she would like to do. But primarily, you know, what do you bring to the table that would draw people to you. And who do you like, and what worked for you in the past, that's the other thing because you have pictures of success in quality world. Okay, uh, we talked about that we focused on the thinking and the act of doing. And, umm… we talked about what can you control. So this is another key factor. So, you know, out of all of this, what can you control. The thing is, is that she was holding on so much to wishing that things would be different. If only my friends hadn't died, my life would be better. But as long as she was playing that loop over and over again, that wasn't getting her anywhere, right? She was stuck in that thinking. And so the question is, what you can control. There is nothing that you can do about that and it's kind of a hard thing. I mean, sounds strange, doesn't it? But it's kind of a hard thing to give that up, to think about, if I let that go. And the other piece of that is, for people who are grieving, the idea of letting go of that grief is also a difficult thing to do because it's so associated with the relationship, with the connection, what if I forget, you know, uh, letting go. So there's a lot different dimensions to working with somebody with grief. Okay, so we don't work in the past as I have talked about before, with the exception of understanding, umm… clients wants what's worked in the past. So it's one of the things that we like to do is look at the past for strengths. How you've overcome things before and so on. It's interesting to me to notice that it really is difficult for people to remember the times that they haven't, that they have been successful versus haven't. And I think that's because in general, and if you think about this for yourselves, what we're most aware of in our lives, is the painful perception that we have when things aren't going well as opposed to when things are going smoothly. And it'd really be good, just a suggestion, for all of us myself included, when things are going smoothly to take a moment and go, well, this is a nice day. Wow! Things are working great. Wow! Things are okay. Because if you start to look at those things, it builds up your enthusiasm and your optimism. Okay, and so we'd help clients understand they are products of the past, but don't have to be victims of some of the past. So again, helping her to move forward. Okay, so, uh, so we've talked about moving the client from what is it you don't want. So I don't want to be lonely, I don't want to be isolated, I want to be able to have friends, we move from the don't want, to the do want. Then we say, well, what is that you're doing so far to get what you want. In this case, Susan was staying in her room, she was socially isolated, she was playing sad music, she was looking at her photos of all of her friends. I mean, she was really maintaining that stuckness in the problem and in the grief. And so when I would ask her, is doing all of those things, helping you to move forward to make connections with others, to make connections with yourself to lead a happier and healthier life. Well, the answer is no, right? It's working in some way, but it's not working as well as it could be. So then the next step is when she realizes it's not working then where are you gonna go from here? And so then in the reality therapy process, we help the clients develop plans to make a small step to move things into control. So one of the concepts that you probably heard about is smart goals and it's a nice way to remember them, you want to keep goals simple. So it has to be something that is easy to do, so we don't want to make it, you know, I'm gonna meet a hundred people and be the president of the student club, that's, that's too, too large, right? But to make it simple, I'm going to approach one person in my art class next week, that's simple, right? Measurable, can we measure if that happens? Yeah, it is happened or it didn't, right? Attainable, is it possible that the client can do that? So you want to do something that's she can actually accomplish, that's actually controlled by herself also because it can't be something that somebody else is gonna do. It's something that she can do and control it by herself, something that's realistic and time-oriented. So by the time that we next… meet next week you're going to this, right? When are you going to do it, real specific. And so I also like to write contracts personally, so write it down, so there's a power I think in having a contract with somebody when you write down, this is the plan, sign the plan, tell me again what you're gonna do. And for me, I like to say, okay, so this is what you said you're gonna do. Will you shake on it? And just that thing of making that agreement having that accountability is a powerful thing because then the client knows because we always check up then, when the client comes back, did you do it? And if you didn't, what got in the way? Because that's the other thing because behavior is purposeful sometimes the purpose of the behavior we're trying to change gets in the way of moving forward. And if that's the case, we need to revisit the plan. Now I want to mention the other thing is that if there is resistance to this what you realize is you're moving too fast. And so sometimes you have to go back to even relationship building, the clients not connected. So the intuitiveness of counseling really comes into play as you're working through this process. Okay, so making a treatment plan I'm just gonna go through this briefly, the problem, uh, among many, but this is just concisive and cut down, so you can kind of see how it over… it presents itself. So the problem is Susan has no friends, uh, the targeted behavior is what she's doing right now. She comes home from school, goes directly to her room or she listens to sad music and reminisces. And so the goal number one is she'll develop satisfying relationships with friends and family, so that's a large goal, right? So what you want to do is you have objectives, so these are the things that she can do immediately to start to get her to the larger goal. And so you see that these are the ways that she is gonna put that into action. And… Are these measurable? Attainable? Right? Simple? So she can identify three ways to meet people, she spends an hour with her family instead of hiding out in her room. And so, for me, in, in therapy, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna help her complete an interest inventory, well, why am I going to do that? Because she doesn't have an idea in her life about what she brings to the table, where exactly she can connect. She doesn't have a good self's, sense of self identity, so if I'm gonna work with her on an interest inventory, it's gonna start to give her a picture of ways that she can get her needs met. And then we'll role-play how she is going to approach people at the university because she doesn't have a good sense of how to do that. She knew her friends from her childhood. She didn't have a way of connecting with friends, umm… in the present. And so we're gonna do individual therapy twice monthly. That's the modality, that's how we're gonna put in action because she'll have plenty of time to put things into action between that time and when I see her. Okay, so I want… just want talk a little bit about DSM, which you all know is the diagnostic and statistical manual. And DSM is not based on theory, it's a way of categorizing symptoms and providing descriptions of behaviors that might be characteristic of disorders. So umm… and it's not prescriptive so this is a way that… this is an important thing in our field, uh, that sometimes we have to incorporate. For me, as a choice theory person, umm… Glasser doesn't believe in diagnosis for some of the reasons I'm gonna tell you in just a minute. However, in the real world, diagnosis is a part of the counselor's life. You have to do that for many reasons, so from a choice theory perspective, when I look at DSM, what I think is this just describes behavior that's all it does. And then there is a label that's attached to that. And so I can say, okay, I understand behaviors through what I already identified and so I can assign a diagnosis. The problem is that when we assign labels, this follows people around, right? Uh, now this is not about DSM, but about labels. I have a son who is mentally handicapped. And he had to be labeled when he was in school as far as what his level of education was in order to get services. And so when he was little, umm… he was… The teachers told me he was on the border of educated able, educationally mentally handicapped and, umm… what was the other one, the second one, it was, umm… it was like he, he was mentally handicapped in a way that he could learn things, but he couldn't be educated. I have a mental block to it because it was a very painful perception to me. And so I said, if he was on the boundary of this, the educable was the better one. And I said, put him in that category then. And they said, well, it doesn't really matter, we do the same things. And I said if it doesn't really matter then put him in the higher one because I believe it does matter when you put labels on people. Because whatever they would choose to do for him, would make it difference whether it was doing behavioral kind of skills, the lower level or trying to educate him. So that's the danger when we put labels on people. Umm… another criticism is that the focus is on diagnosis rather than on the person. It's not applicable to some cultures, that is really the truth, isn't it? When you think about the Fourth Force Multiculturalism and Post-Modernism, about how we need to consider someone's culture. Umm… when you look at DSM and you think about behaviors, you could see how they don't fit across the board. And umm… then it defines normal and abnormal ways of being without considering the culture. So how do you define what is normal. What's normal for one family and not another. But finally, what the strengths are, of the DSM, is it helps organize us and provides questions for assessment. Umm… it gives us ideas about how to accurately diagnose because it is real specific about behaviors, uh, provides a structure that's rec… that's recognized by health care providers and we know that that's just a necessity of our modern world. And then it gives a common language for counselors to aid an assessment and treatment planning. But I will tell you that one thing, umm… when… what I've noticed that this, this was a trend for a while is that they were a lot of people being diagnosed as border line personality. And people who would refer to their clients as my border line client or my bipolar client or whatever else. And I remember when I heard that, I thought this is really the danger of when we lose people in the diagnosis, when somebody all of a sudden becomes described as their symptoms rather than as who they are as a person. So DSM is a necessity for us, you can understand the importance of DSM and you can use it theoretically, to understand what needs to happen as far as a description of symptoms. But for us, the theoretical case conceptualization is the way that we really take our theory, put it into action and that's where the good times roll. Because that's where your creativity comes in, that's where your understanding comes in and that's why theory is so important. So we covered a lot again. I hope the examples were clear, at least gave you a starting point to think about diff… things a little bit differently, that just is my theory. And that's even this much of the theory and there's some short amount of time, there's not so much we can say. But it gives you an idea about how I think through my theoretical lens, how I understand what's going on for yourself you would do those same things, but you would understand through your own theory of human nature. And you would also write case conceptualization and treatment plans based on what you believe is important. And that goes back all the way to the beginning, which is why having a theoretical construct is critical for yourself in having effective counseling and helping your clients. So that's the end of this piece that I have for you right now. And now I would like to open the floor for you, if have any questions. 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN I do. How does a reality therapy work with clients who have unrealistic wants? 

00:45:45
PATRICIA ROBEY Well, that's really a good question. Because that's true, very often people have unrealistic wants. And this is where theory comes in to be so important to and understanding what needs to happen. So I'll give you a story based on my son that I mentioned who is a special needs guy. And umm… he… In our family we like racing, umm… everybody has a race car. I've even raced at the dragstrip, in, in, in days ago, but not, not currently. Although I do have a very nice sports car right now. But anyway, we all like racing and so my son also likes racing especially at this time of year when, umm… it's spring time, people are starting to tune up their cars, they are talking about going to the, the dragstrip and, umm… so he'll often say to me… this is what comes up, mom, I want a car so bad. Okay, so the thing is about that is that, umm… he can have a car, but what he really means is I'd like to drive a car and that's not realistic for him. Now the thing is that I would never tell somebody you can never have that want. I mean, think how devastating that would be. But because of my theory, what I understand is that that want to have a car and to drive a car satisfies one or more of the basic needs. So see this is the, the understanding where it comes into play. So I know when my son says I want a car so bad, that he wants it because it'll satisfy one or more of the needs, love and belonging, power, freedom, fun, survival. And so where the reality therapy practice comes in is taking it to where he can understand, well, as long as I know that they would satisfy those needs, I can say, Brian, if you had that car, what would you be doing? Well, he likes to go to Pizza Hut. Okay. And what are you getting when you're at Pizza Hut? See quality world pictures are real specific. I'll get sausage pizza, coke with no ice, you know, he is got very specific things. Who would be there with you for love and belonging? Well, my friend John. Okay, and so, if I know that there are specific ideas about what getting… what having a car would get for him, I can help him get that. So we can't always help people get what they want, but we can help them get the needs met that would be met by that picture of having the ideal goal. So I can say to Brian, well, I can help you get to Pizza Hut, while you're waiting maybe to get your car be able to drive because I don't want to kill that dream. So it's the same things. So when people can't get the idea and a lot of people have unrealistic wants. But if you know, even for yourself, if you say something is unrealistic, but you know that if I could do that, I would meet my needs for belonging, power, freedom, fun or survival, you can think. How can I get that need met right now in a way that's realistic? Well, maybe down the road, I can get that ideal dream. And truthfully, that's kind of how the way it was that I got to get my doctorate, because I started by taking a class for personal interest. And for me, that was because I was told that college wasn't a goal for women because you would just get married and have children and it will be wasted. I always wanted it and so in my '30s, I took a class at a time, if I had had their big goal of getting my doctorate, I might not have done it. But one small step at a time and before you know it sometimes those wants can be addressed. So I hope that's kind of encouraging for you to know that like this Rolling Stone said, can't always get want you want, but if you try sometimes you get what you need. And so I think that's kind of the final wrap up story for our time together. And I thank you for that question and thank you so much for your attention. Hope you're taking away something that's really significant for you today. So thank you so much.
