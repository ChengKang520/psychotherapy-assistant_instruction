REID WILSON Hello, everyone. My name is Reid Wilson, I'm a psychologist from Chapel Hill, North Carolina. We're going to talk about what's up on the screen treating Obsessive Compulsive Disorders and then I do pretty much every day of my life when I'm working. You can download the handout, and I'll show you that in a minute, they've asked me to read the education objective. So I will explain two primary though dysfunctional objectives of clients with OCD this is the first. Second, defend the importance of altering perception as opposed to utilizing technique to help clients with OCD. And third describe and utilize persuasive therapy to frame the treatment protocol for OCD. If you want this handout, the easiest way to go just thinking of brieftherapyconference.com. You want to go one more step, it's download, one more step, primary faculty then my first initial and last name and it's 37, workshop 37. So all of us know what obsessions and compulsions are. We're going to just orient ourselves though obsessions are those things that freak them out. It's a clinical term, if you haven't heard that before, so it typically is a fear that something bad is going to go wrong and it's going to be my fault. And you'd see they're already gone wrong and I need to go find out or it might go wrong in the future if don't take care of business and so for the vast, vast majority of people we will ever see, they won't be what we call "pure obsessionals" they will actually have compulsions as the only thing they can figure out to do to get rid of the obsessions. So they're going to be repetitious of course, unproductive behaviors and they tend to be pretty rigid in what they do which -- if you stick it out with me this whole time you will see, it's good news for us as therapist, if they have a rigid protocol, because if it's rigid, that means whatever steps are there, we'll mess with one of them, it tends to change everything. So we're going to look at how to mess with things again another clinical term you may not familiar with. So the compulsion create a sense of relief temporarily, but you know everything comes back around and they repeat it. We have a number of subtypes that we talk about pure obsessionals are almost unheard off, the mistake we've made in the past is to think that people with thinking rituals are pure obsessionals. But very often, there are people who both have obsessions and compulsions up in their mind, I'll give you an example in a minute. The most common people we will see in treatment are going to be washers and cleaners. It's true you'll see some clients with several of these sub types, but if they have a single one very often, this is the most predominant one, this is the issue of contamination, they can be contaminated by germs as you know, but doesn't have to germs, they can be contaminated by depression. They can be contaminated by Christmas. They can be contaminated by a city in the world. So for instance say, you know if they're afraid of Milwaukee I think it's a like a phobia just stay away from Milwaukee but that's not how it works. It means, they're going to be afraid of anything that comes out of Milwaukee, right. So there goes a whole bunch of cheese, most of the beer in a country, they have to know where the shoe manufactures are and the clothing manufactures and so forth, because all of those things would be contaminated. The next largest category that we tend to see in treatment, are going to be checkers, these are the ones that check their doors and faucets and windows and breaks in their car, so forth. These are also the people who are afraid they have hit somebody accidently on the highway or caused an accident. Now it's a good example to be thinking of that one to understand what it's like for them. So imagine driving down the road, feeling a little bump thinking maybe you felt a bump, not sure what it was, afraid that it might have been a pedestrian, because it was twilight light and you couldn't see very well. You quite possibly could have hit the pedestrian, and knock them into the ditch in the high grass. If you don't find them, they're going to bleed to death and be dead by morning. So you're going to pull the car over and you're going to walk the ditches looking for that body and you will do it for hours until you exhausted and finally go home, not reassured, you're going to watch that evening news for the hit-and-run, you're going to buy the paper the next morning, looking for the story the hit-and-run you're turning yourself into the sheriff, you become a nuisance. Out of this fear of no one knows that this is happened about me. So one of the things we want to focus on when we're working on people with OCD is to get intense report with what it's like for them. If you don't get a close proximity of what it's like, then when you go to ask them to do some of the radical things that we will suggest, they're not going to want to come with you. So on top of checkers, the next we might have is repeaters, this is as good as it gets the movie with well with Dustin Hoffman what was his name, Jack Nicholson. Okay, he'd flip his lights on and off over and over again. So the issue with repeaters, they're the only subtype that have magical thinking. The five year old step on a crack breaking my mother's back. So there is a logic to washing my hands when I think I have contamination with a repeater, if I don't dress and undress ten times before I go to bed tonight, my husband is not going to get his promotion tomorrow, my sister is going to lose the volley ball competition. My parents are going to die on the drive to Florida tomorrow, so there is that remote behavior so, often repeaters have to back up in time and space, walk through or do the movement again without the negative thought or with a positive thought, or with the neutral thought, it varies somewhat but they will till they get a right they're going to repeat that again and again. Orders now are starting to get to that people who don't really want to change that badly, you will get again somebody with a number of subtypes and ordering and very often, they need or want to address this particular issue. If they have a number of subtypes ordering may just be in a small territory in their home or their office. They may need to have the office desk just perfect, well, okay that's nice to need organized environment, organized mind, but they can leave the office, they can go to lunch until everything is pristine. One of the questions you might ask them is how's your closet and that's the way to find out about hoarders, so they will say, well you know it's neat, I have organized according to the seasons and colors to matching things and hang those a quarter of an inch apart and the shoe laces of course, can touch each other and then all of a sudden there that is, right, so those are hoarders. Hoarders, is another great category of people who as you know with the TV show hoarders and hoarding, they don't really want to change, but they've been driven to change, they've been, their houses being contaminated, they have been divorced and their spouses taking the house away from them, and the fire marshal is contaminate that they're going to lose their children and so forth or the floors are caving in because of the rot. With hoarders we're probably moving hoarders out of OCD if you have been following DSM5 and it's going to me OC spectrum disorder along with trichotillomania and trich disorder and body dysmorphic disorder and self mutilation and so forth. There one of the distinctions is what I'm afraid of as a hoarder is that I'm going to regret tomorrow what I get rid of today. So you really have two things, they have acquiring, so in the acquiring process, it is mainly the thrill of the hunt. You know, I can get onto qvc.com, not me, I'm saying hypothetically with hoarders takes one to three one I know, but this is not my issue. I can get onto qvc.com and with about three or four punches of some buttons, I've got a package that's going to arrive at my door step in two days and that's thrilling to me. The package comes and they stack it up and never open it. When you -- I did a episode 18 of hoarders and this was family of two grown daughters and grandmother, all three are hoarders. The mother had married a hoarder, two hoarders married each other. There was two uncles and an aunt too were hoarders. Now, when you walk into their dining room, it is stacked full of boxes that have never been opened, you go into the bedroom and all over the beds are closed that still have all their tags on them, these people collected beanie babies, 2,500 beanie babies and so now you would think hoarders would be somewhat organized, so they could find the things they need to and it was just a pig style, I mean they had twelve cats, because they hoarded animals as well. Cat feces and vomit over all the carpets in the house them walk-through in bare feet. I was the only person on the crew who didn't wear a face mask during the two days of filming because, it's going to be on TV, so but I throw my closet each nights of those two nights had to buy new stuff all over again. Now here is thinking rituals or ritualizes these are people who would have very often has to do the religiosity, scrupulosity, I will have for instance, a blast from a thought or blast from this image, I will see Jesus Christ on the cross with an erection and that's blasphemous. So now I have to repeat a prayer, a very specific prayer with a right reverence and cadence and so forth again and again until I can get rid of that. Thinking rituals are also done in service of the other disorders subtypes like a checker, so you'll have a client who checks their office to make sure everything is unplugged, office isn't going to burn down, they've actually locked it and so forth and they come home, parking in their drive way and sit in the drive way for 45 minutes mentally reviewing. So that you mental checking to cover the physical checking to make sure there haven't been any mistakes. So you know probably that the treatment of choice goal standard for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is exposure and response prevention. We want to expose them to not the feared sensation, but the feared consequences, we want to just have that in mind as we talk about we're not if we have somebody with the fear of contamination, touching something that contaminates their hands, they're not been exposed to the hands being contaminated, they're been exposed to the possibility that they will make their children sick in the future if they come home with that. So when we do some of the exposure stuff, we want to make sure you've got the right task in mind. So we're going to expose them to the feared situation or stimulus and outcome and then response prevention is to have them not to do their ritual. Now what we want to keep in mind is this model came out of the hospital design. So if you went to NFOs program in Phille, if you're a washer and cleaner, they put you in room and they would disconnect the plumbing, so you couldn't wash your hands and they would contaminate you on day one. And you would not get a shower for five days, then you would get a five minute shower, and as soon as you got out of the shower and dry it off, if you didn't stop the water in five minutes, the staff turns it off for you. Once you're dried and dressed again, the staff contaminates you and you're walking around again 24 hours a day contaminated and if you go to bed, you'd would have some issues when your contamination is feces they'll dip a little tissue in feaces and dab it all over your pajamas, dab it all over the bed and you'll sleep in that every night. So and then after three weeks 75% of the worst cases in the world of OCD are better and that's habituation that's a behavior model. We're going to do something little different here, because I'm kind of a different person and so I hope that will make sense to you as we talk about. One of the problems that I see in exposure in response prevention is first the rationale that we explained to clients about why we're doing, what we're doing and how you get better. When you talk to your client, who is anxious and you tell them that as you do this practice for three or four weeks or two or three months or whatever over and over again it goes through this mini torture experience then over those weeks or months, you will discover that, you don't need to do you ritual in order to get rid of your obsession. Now, to some degree, I think that that is cruel and unusual punishment. People don't like exposure. It's terribly uncomfortable, number one. And number two, when you see somebody who is anxious, they want to know what to do right now. They don't want to be look and wait over here. They want answers about this, so we want to be giving them at least an explanation of here is what you do in the moment with all of this. So the second issue I have with the exposure and response prevention is, can we not instead of taking them through all of this for them to have a spontaneous awareness that their compulsion is gone and they didn't do their obsession. Can't we explain that to them upfront a little better and have them understand that? And we -- obviously people do that, therapists do that in explanation, but what I've been working on is really embellishing that process. What the slide that's up here now is saying that. If we can alter belief, prior to exposure, we already know that exposure leads to habituation. But what we also know in the data is that when habituation is paired with the belief change that is more stable overtime. Let's put the belief change upfront, what I have found and we've just done this research to show that is if we can do in that way, we can create a change in belief system and then if we can do exposure in response prevention out of that belief system, then there is less resistance to the work, they're more motivated to do what they need to know. They're more willing to collaborate with us. We move habituation along faster, so that's what I've been looking at and I'm going to show you a little I know that you at this time of the day and this day of the week that you're wanting to look at statistics with me now and so I have a fear to show you. So and I'm going to move quickly through them because just want to move quickly, so we get on to the things, but I want you to see, I did a study few years ago, about five, six years ago with the model that I'm going to tell you about. And what you see up here is a measurement called the Y-BOCS, Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale it's a 0 to 40 severe amongst OCD, doesn't diagnose OCD, it's a talk about severity. So in this the pivot study what you're seeing is in blue, right before the, so I'm doing an intervention which is two days, 14 hours 8 people and me you know 13x13 room not that you need to know that but so I'm going to work for two days on learning all of this stuff and also practicing of course, you have to be in action. So the blue is when they come in that's what you're seeing way over here that's a little dot. The red is one week later, the green, one month, the purple two months. When is the biggest change? In the first week and what I want you to notice about that is that there is no really how it tends to go in treatment of the anxiety disorders or in OCD which is you don't tend to get a rapid game in the first week and then a progressive improvement. What you're seeing is people who got zero treatment after the two days, or if you see the next slide, just another group of five of them, again, you see this dramatic drop and for lot of people we have what we call generative change, it builds on ourselves and they get better and better along the way. This guy at the end here, he said, you know Scott said I don't really like your protocol, I like shortages, Brain Lock see what happens when you don't listen to me, no good. He is the last one just to show you about, here is the worst person that we saw, the 36 on the score of 40 and look at the dramatic drop. If you look at this guy, this is the only one in the study who got no further therapy and within three months he was normal at a 18 month follow-up he was still doing great. Now, what I want to tell you about this guy, couple of things I will tell you, in this two day treatment and I'm not promoting do it in two days and I'm not. We're just trying to help, you get a sense of this process. So people come in at 9.30 in the morning and I found a way at them for four hours, just pound a way at them about the principles. Then they've to go to lunch and practice for an hour and half, while I take a nap. It's tiring to pound a way of people, you don't know what it's like to try to be statistic. It's just exhausting so, I'm taking a nap, they're going to practice, when they practice they'll selected three things that they need to practice we've seen there are hierarchy of their fears and we pick some things they go up. And then, over night on Saturday night, they go out and they practice three more times and then Sunday at lunch, they go out and practice three more times. This guy I'm talking about who went down and got well, not too long after that. On Sunday, when he went to practice, he did 21 practices instead of three, what is that mean, what I'm interpret that to mean is he caught on to the principles and translated them into action which was my job is to go out and score as many points as I can over lunch, because as we do the protocol, how you score points again the protocol, every time they do a protocol they get points. So this was I think also of the guy who was afraid that he was going to stab his wife and impulsively. So on Sunday morning I want to help him work on that, so I bring about seven knives from my home from anywhere from a little plastic knife up to the big butcher knife that my wife keeps by the bed while I travel with the German Shepherd sleeping in the bed. And so I brought that too and so I asked at before lunch if somebody would be willing, a women would be willing to come up and volunteer to sit in front of him and having put the knife up to her throat and say I'm look afford to see in the red blood pour across your chest as I slice your neck open and all four of the women the group volunteered they were together, they were -- I didn't volunteer just by the way, but I wasn't women so. But all of them came up and he was able to do that and this is the kind of work that we would tend to do. At lunch time on Sunday, he is got this issue around what am I missing, people with this is a kind of a little subgroup of people too this would be at a client who would drive down the highway, super highway and see he bucks in the medium and get often the next exit turn around go down the ramp again, go in other direction pull over parallel to the bucks cross four lines of traffic to check the box in case it's hers right. So he is got that same issue too. And his issue is what am I missing, so if he walks by a year, a new stand and sees part of the headline in the news paper he now has to buy the newspaper and read the article. So as he is practicing what is the practice, the practice in part which we'll talk about is to go toward, seek out uncertainty, I want to get this uncertain as I can about these themes. So he is a washer and a cleaner and he is checker around this kind of stuff so, he is at McDonald's on Sunday working on his practice and one of them that we had agreed to was that he would buy a sandwich, hamburger at McDonald's, he put it directly on the counter and start off under paper and top a paper and then wash your hands before he eat, so he went into the bathroom, washed his hands and dried his hands off with newspaper. So that when he's eating the hamburger, he is eating with hands have black ink all over them and so he is doing that practice and there is a TV in the corner of McDonald's and it's got CNN playing and long the bottom of CNN, you know there is a little ticker tape that is telling another story, because we have over stimulate everybody or they will change the channel. And so he eat practice with start of reading one of those and then divert his eyes, so he couldn't see the rest of it, just to get himself to stop. That's the kind of practice that we're looking for when we do this work and that I think in part is was why he got better. We just finished doing the study of three people with seven scales and I'll show you first slide just for a very moment, a brief moment still you see the change. What I want to suggest is do I have to out exposure in response prevention, but let's initiate treatment in a new way. So we're looking at coming in and now, we're looking at how they are in their walking, how they are doing the day after they finish and then one month later, because if we can get them going, then everybody keeps do an exposure and response prevention and gets better. Here is the obsessive belief question there. Here's the type of topics people worry about and you see once again, immediate drop in the scores which are all significant walking in versus the day after walking in versus a month later, all significant responses. Here is another measure of OCD, all significant changes for those folks, this is another measure, all significant from one month away here. Lastly, is something we've already directly working on, this is an acceptance and commitment therapy scale of mindfulness and acceptance and the higher the score, the more resilient the person is. So even now working on that, there is this generative change that they kept getting stronger overtime. That's supposed to give you some placebo. I want to show you those, so you might be thinking at this point, that's interesting, I guess maybe I will stick it out for another 15 minutes and see if it's still interesting. So also we want to do with our clients is looking for as much placebo as we can because we're going to be showing them very quickly. We're going to lose some report at the beginning, but we need to have them have the sense that we know we were talking about. That would be new right. So here is what we're thinking about how you recover from OCD. First is do anything other than resist. That's the most important thing for us to think about. What we get our clients to do is irrelevant, it's what we get them to stop doing. When they talk about mindfulness, it's certainly gets in the ballpark of what we're looking for, which is we want all anxious clients to allow physical and emotional arousal to come forward without resisting. So you can do some cookie things, if you don't lose report too much as long as they stop resisting. When clients coming in over here resisting, you may want to come over here and help them to tolerate it, accept it, do some breathing relax and so forth. But this is a slippery slope, back to resistance, because I promise you these people come in with a very rigid belief system and frame of reference which says I can't allow this stuff to happen. So I'll do whatever you ask as long as I can be assured nothing goes wrong. So it's very easy to slip back over here. We're going to go over here to a more provocative position, which is I want what it is that I'm terrified about, because it's a lot more difficult to resist while I'm doing this. So we're going to talk about that, the other three that we'll talk about in sequence is that we're going to all three frame of reference that's what I've been mentioning, framing up the action is how do I take this frame of reference down to moment by moment, actions and how do I direct myself and then everybody is going to do the action, right. I'm basically in the simplest forms of cognitive therapists, so not a behavior therapists, so I don't do habituation. I do challenging belief systems through behavioral experiments, but you have to do actions or it's all theoretical. What's wrong with the resist, what we want to do is have them face uncertainty and face the discomfort that comes with the uncertainty. What's wrong with the resistant doubt and discomfort, I love to be comfortable, I'm build for comfort, not for speed. I can tell you and I love the ride ask my wife it's a good feeling, but if I'm going to learn anything new, I have to be willing to be awkward and clumsy and uncertain and insecure. That comes with the territory of learning new tasks and skills, so you got to feel uncomfortable and doubtful, first, if you have an anxiety disorder and if you resist anything that's resisted we'll persist. So we want to have them fully experience some of this stuff and it will start to fade away. If I want to live independently like go off my crutches, get off my medication, not have to keep living with my parents, not beyond that all from the government, then I have to figure out, how to step out there and be anxious and doubtful and that's of course, you know as well as I do that one of the things we have to say to these people is you want to go little slow, before you decide to change, because right now, you are uncertain about whether your hands are clean, which you and I both know is irrational to some level. If you overcome that, you're going to uncertain about all those things around living a life as an independent adult and you think this is hard that stuff is pretty tough. So make you're ready to go into that territory. There is a Chinese proverb, to be uncertain is to be uncomfortable, to be certain is to be ridiculous. So we know that they're on the wrong track, trying to get this certainty. Nice way to this I think, my opinion is the nice way, right. So organize what we're talking about regarding going from resistance to permitting to provoking. If you resist down here, this is somebody else has a pointer? There was two pointers up there, could you stop that? Here is how the anxiety wins, this is how the client is going to win. When you resist, oh my god, that can't happen, I can't let that happen. It will be terrible, now we're starting to move into permitting, I can tolerate this happening, but I don't like it, I don't want it. This is the position that they will be in when they're better. When they're well, when they're leaving treatment with you, when they no longer have OCD or whatever the anxiety disorder is, they will be I can do this. I can tolerate this, when you're better with OCD, you still have the obsessions. They pop up and you let him go. Oh my, I could turn the car into bridge, but kill everybody on board that OCD again, right. Then, you just let it go that's as good as it is going to look we might say and that and makes them normal of course, all of those have those thoughts, right. So but getting let's not start here, let's start over here is my opinion and starting over here is absolutely absurd. It's absurd to be seeking out and desiring to feel miserable. We're not trying to extinguish the part of me that says I don't like this, I don't want this. This is really uncomfortable, I can't stand this, we're adding this other voice too, which is actually I don't want this and I don't like it and I want it and we're going to talk about how to help convince them that they wanted. And here you see at the end, why I play a game because they are already playing a mental game with anxiety and losing. So we maze up to the fact that this is they're been manipulated and let's change this around. Just as an aside of just finished go for psychotherapy network, so if you happened that the January, February issue would be cover issue is on anxiety and so article that I've written and article that Lynn Lince has written who is here and an article from David Burns, Feeling Good and there are other stupid books that competes with my book. I'm not going to tell you that one, but it's really a good book. So this is frame of reference and we've just oriented ourselves, we know what a frame reference is, how we kind of look upon what our world is like and what our role is in the world. So we know what to do next and here are all the synonyms for frame of reference point of view cognitive set, cognitive schema, added to disposition, orientation, frame of mind, that's what we were talking about. We want to work up here who is at my talk on Wednesday or Thursday, okay. You need a little repetition to get this stuff here right. Otherwise I have to skip all these slides for these other people, right. So we want to go up here and then bring it down to action, that's what I'm going to be same. Here is my good friend Einstein, but this is placebo too, you know put a slide up from Einstein and have an intelligence by association, right. So Einstein has problems cannot be solved by thinking with the framework in which they were created. And that's what we're going to run up against they're going to plug in what you say to their frame of reference, that's why we have to address it so firmly. So we've no paranoids gets a friend, its right. We're not talking about paranoids but if I believe that the FBI has put up probe in my brain and is listening to everything I'm saying and then telling me what to do, then everything else I'm doing in life makes totally good sense in that framework. If I think I'm Jesus Christ, I probably think I'm a good carpenter those kinds of things, right. Same with OCD which is if I believe the faults I'm having, the fears I'm having to be valid then everything I'm doing is built into that, so I think the reason, people change quickly is because we're going to go over here and create another framework for them to step into, so instead of this progressive, moving up the hierarchy, that to some degree is like death by a thousand cuts, we're going to take one big step over to new frame of reference, either I can do this one or I can try on this one. This seems really comfortable and safe for me, but I'm going to go ahead and trust that my therapists knows what's she is talking about, alright. So we're going to perceive it, helpful to perceive it as a mental game, but no it's very serious and this is horrible disorder and these are some of the sickest people you will see within the anxiety field. But this is what happens if you think it's serious. Now I was hiking by myself a while back and I was climbing up a rock face and all of a sudden I got light headed and dizzy. And before I could say anything I was on all fours. I was just instantly down there, because of this position, you know, the sensation popped up in to my mind of this dizziness and my own conscious said we know what, you better get down in your knees really quickly because if you pass out, you're going to crack your head open and roll down the hill and you'll be dead and no one will find you in the high grass till morning, right. But it just, right, the sensation popped up, my body and mind took it seriously, it my body and mind trying to get rid of my doubt and to get rid of my distress once I was down and my hands and knees with no more dizziness I was fine that was nothing, but right. There was where we want to go over here is with OCDs this is a mental game, so when a fearful thought pops up, the contempt of what I'm thinking about is irrelevant, totally irrelevant. Here is the trick because I'm going to personify OCD, the content is always relevant to the individual, that's how OCD knows to pick it, alright. So I know a mother who was got OCD as she is having a baby and so as she is changing her baby diapers on the stand, she finishes up takes through off the stand and walks away and said did I just stick my finger up her vagina. Well, now you're a new mother having that thought is horrifying. Now you might be allowed to be alone with my daughter, what is wrong with me that I have those thoughts. That's what they're up again, so it's going to pick, it picked that for her because that's she is vulnerable. Half of the students, I live in a town. Half of the students I see with OCD think that they are gay. Because they have OCD and they're terrified about that, and they're totally freaked out and then there is this little twist that OCD does which is I quiz them about desires and so forth and there is no desire, if there was any desire one person of their gender then there would be a sexual orientation issue question and we would work in that way, but it is not about that, but they say no, I don't have any feel on somebody of my own gender, but what I'm afraid of is if I'm not anxious, those feelings will show up and that would be terrible, so if they were in a real conundrum in that way. So the content is irrelevant. I want uncertainty why in the world would you want uncertainty? Well, the simple answer is because it's opposite of what OCD requires of me to think. So if OCD is sitting across from me, again if you're personifying it, OCD is going to throw me these fearful thoughts or images or impulses and the distress that goes with it. If OCD is going to win, how do I need to respond to those someone needs to answer that loud and I'll repeat your answer. So if OCD throws me, thoughts or images or impulses that are pouring to me and the distress that goes with it, how do I need to respond in order for OCD to win that little battle? Yes. For it to win, try to get rid of it, anything that stop or get afraid of it take it seriously get reassurance from some of that. That's what going to happen, so what's the opposite of that? The opposite of that is not going to frankly to go into neutral. Be nice to go into neutral about it to dissociate from it, to be completely detached from it again that's how they look when they're better, but you -- and I'll show you a little slide that helps I hope understand that piece around, you can't go from terrified to detached. From the beginning, we've going to have to something else because that's just too hard to do. I want to be uncertain, when you're uncertain, how're you going to feel? You're going to feel distressed, so you got to be whelmed to be distressed too if you want to get better and that's what I'm saying about taking a one fail sweep a big step and you can begin the change. So here is the game board with OCD, so with what you see on the board, somebody call out to me what the game board is. I'll just wait here patiently. What's the game board? Uncertainty, that's good, you did great. You pass. The game board is uncertainty, why am I wasting your time like this, I want we've got a edge that in our top of heads here around uncertainty that's what we're working. I mean, I'm working on contamination or being a pedophile or any of that stuff or working on uncertainty these people have an intolerance of uncertainty. This is the game board, in grey means OCD is taken over life by going in and saying you can't handle uncertainty. That's how it wins, and it comes in and takes our natural proclivity to where we no way in the world anybody is going to you're not going to have a client come in and say thank you so much for teaching me that relaxation skill. I don't even worry anymore. Last week, the office caught on fire, I was so relaxed, I just sat there. Right that we'll never going to get there right. So it's going to take that natural tendency and use it by embellishing it and have people scare the Jesus out of themselves. That's a southern term, Jesus you have that here. Okay. And then our natural defenses of avoiding and fighting and running and embracing that's going to take that and then it's going to dominate them and you know dominates them just like panic disorder dominate somebody. You have a panic attack that last for three minutes, it's like five, tens of a percent of the day and it dominates the whole day. You interview somebody and say well how much time do you spend with your compulsions per day? Probably 45 minutes. How much time do you spend with your obsessions? All day. All day. So hard to get things going when it's like that. Here is where we're going to move. This is obviously a very simple design, there is a lots of intentions people have. We do want to have them have an outcome picture, we'll talk about that a little bit. That's an intention I want to get there, but in the moment, if the game board is uncertainty, then we want to help them, not just willing, but willing would be okay. I'm willing to be uncertain, but we kind of increase the power fivefold when we go from I'm willing to I want to. You ever try to get a fifth grade or to practice playing the guitar, soon you can have a dinner and do you have done your half hour practice there. I -- hate this again -- okay, I've done it, now we can eat. Have your fifth grade girl with this cousin and his cousin says, now his cousin -- cousin is 16, he says hey, you know, I'm in high school. I play in a rock band all the girls love us fifth grade boys. I want to be like him, I want to play in rock band when I'm in high school. My cousin says, everyday he practices for half hour to get good at guitar, so that he can play in the rock band. I don't care about the rock band. I care about the girls idea and so now he is practicing every day, because he's got their intention, so you want something that will pull them, future pull, but in the moment, it's this and then the resources of course, nice to have a lot of them what you need to know is they're going to come in asking for confidence. I'll do whatever you say doc, I'll be your best patient, as long as you give me a 100% guarantee, this is going to work and I'm not going to hurt someone or whatever it might be. They're not going to get to have that, they need courage. Being afraid and doing it in anyway and our job is to help them get there. So this is I want you to know that just I'm just I'm a student like you are of this work I'm trying to figure this stuff out and this phrase up front. This is hard, it's been in my vocabulary ten or eleven months, so what was up here before was just I want this. So I want to take stuck that in there to get ownership around this is very difficult task for me and I want to do it anyway. I'm going to tell you three reasons, why some reasonable facts similarly of I want this is a good idea. And I'm going to detail them, because it's what you need to be saying to your clients to convince them that this is a good idea. They do need to be saying this honestly, they're not going to melt the words, I want this, because my therapists tells me to right. So motivation of positive goal and the other two we'll talk about. The first is having an outcome picture and we do want to detail that from them if you saw my demonstration yesterday around the client. First thing I did was try to find out where she want, what she wants in her life. So that there is a reason for her to work this hard data. So we do want to develop that and one of the questions you can just ask is what have you missed out on because of OCD and just get a list of all the things and what I say is can we just would be reasonable to you if we transform this list from what you missed out on to what you want in your future and pretty much everything they will have said is appropriate for the future. All these things of the things they tend to say. Now here is the logic, okay. So you know gone for bid, somebody in your life develops cancer, somebody in your family or you, we know that chemotherapy and radiation treatments are nasty business, if you gets physically ill and you have take off time from work, you hair falls out, your immune system drops, it's rough. And if somebody is driving you to the hospital for treatment, you damn well better be saying, Thank god, I live in the 21st century. Thank goodness I live close to this hospital, this treatment going to help me, help my body, you know augment my body's ability to heal itself. And so that placebo, we want placebo here. What percentage of healing is placebo? 30% of healing unless you talked to some of the people you talked around here around antidepressants you know what the placebo effect that some, they're fine in any other presence? 60% is placebo, the difference between Prozac and a sugar pill is 2%, because now they advertised to consumers directly. So I'll settle for the 30%, right. So here is how it goes with our clients, right. I want the outcome, the next thing this treatment I believe I have faith that this treatment leads to the outcome. I don't want this treatment. Didn't that how our clients do it. Oh, yeah, I'm in cognitive therapy now I'm cognitive behavior therapy and my therapist is saying me how to do this practice. They comment your practice, you say, well did you homework? Oh, yeah, I did my homework. Well, that's great, when did you do it? Last night, you know, and how did they do it? Oh, going to get therapy tomorrow, but go do this practice because she is going to make me feel guilty and so there is no ownerships in that process. We've really want to have people understand that if I want the outcome and this treatment leads to the outcome, then it's what it's almost imperative to what the treatment too. Just like the fifth grade are wanting to learn how to play the guitar, so that one piece. The second is let's just back up and look at habituation a little bit. There is three variables in habituation, frequency, intensity, duration, alright. You've got a practice often enough. This is why people have such trouble with the fear of flying, because they only fly once every three month or so, it's not frequently enough. When you do practice what our literature says now, we're not doing systematic desensitization anymore because it doesn't really work very well, works for phobias, but doesn't work for panic disorder and pretty much anything else. Systematic desensitization teach somebody relax introduce step by version, some imagery of the threatening situation since they get anxious remove it, calm them down again. It doesn't work, we now do exposure, which means that intensity of my distress of the surge levels objective with units of distress from 0 to 100 should be out of 50 or above. I want to explain this to my clients. This is first off, being my client, you and I are not doing behavior therapy, we're doing cognitive therapy, but the principles of this behavior therapy idea is very useful to us, so, the intensity needs to be out of 50 or above and then duration the research says about getting over fear how long he have to practice each time, 45 to 90 minutes. So I socializing that is difficult because a lot of their exposures are very quick, sign my name, introduce myself to someone by something with the clerk this is not enough duration. So if we want, if we need frequency intensity duration then that's what we want. That's what I would want, so it would go like this as we take habituation, add Paradox which is all the treatments for all the anxiety disorders or Paradox. It's nothing new about that what we were talking about here in terms of the basic principles. I want to step into your feared situation and want to become uncertain and anxious about the content, want it to be strong and want it to last. Why? Because that's habituation and you want to habituate. I'm going to show you at the end that by doing this, we short cut habituation. As we do the protocol that we're talking about, it doesn't take them a lot of frequency to have an -- about or if I go toward it, it disappears. So we've got to get them to do it. It's a bad idea, I mean, think it's a bad idea until they actually do it. So, that's why this is persuasive therapy. So the third of the three is, remember what the first one was? What justification for I want this. First one is what? I want the outcome, alright. Second one is habituation frequency, intensity, duration I want to do those because that's where the taste get better. And third is to talk to them about the mangler but she talks to kids about it and she saying kids she says omen, that's their shape like and she said no kids love to learn the word amygdala, and to say at to people amygdala. The amygdala is the panic button, that's a fight-or-flight response fight-or-flight freeze. There is two ways to get to the amygdala. This is a review for some of you, right. The first way is the super highway through sensory awareness into the thalamus to the amygdala fires of in three milli seconds, right. So that's arousal that tends to come even without any conscious or awareness, because just like me when I got dizzy, I didn't I'm going to hold the macro and I'm already on the ground, so with it circumvents conscious awareness. The second is from the peripheral cortex, this is our talking, it's our interpretation. So and that takes a little longer, that's like a back country road, but the thing we want to understand is even if, as you know, if you are in a situation that's not actually threatening, no reason for the amygdalitis fire off. If you say that it's threatening, then the amygdalitis fire off, it will operate impeccably by the false message. The things that we're going to talk about here this little game that we're playing. We're not playing, really playing it against OCD, we're playing it against the prefrontal cortex. We need to get people to stop resisting and they resist by their point of view. I shouldn't do this, this is dangerous, it's a terrible idea to do this. That's the prefrontal cortex talking and the amygdala can't learn when they keep getting stimulated like that. When you are on a plane, and flying across the country and hit turbulence, the planes are built to tolerate turbulence without any problems, but if I interpret the turbulence's dangers, my body fires off like that. So we have to do something to hold that still, how does the amygdala learn. The amygdala learns by being placed in the threatening situation or a reasonable facts similarly that's safe of the original trauma and hanging out, not doing anything, sitting there and that's how it learns that it's secreting too much epinephrine. So if you're trying to help somebody get over the fear of an elevator, if we take it from the perspective of the amygdala, the person stand in front of the elevator, who is afraid of the elevator, the amygdala was going, I know, I know this is dangerous, it's secreting epinephrine on to the elevator you go, the amygdala was going high, I understand this is scary to you. It's going to secrete more epinephrine, oh, we're going up one floor, okay, we're getting off, now this is really scary, okay, she is safe. The amygdala saying wait, we're getting back on the elevator, we're going up again, I don't know if it's safe or not I think I still need to secrete epinephrine. This goes on and on and on. If you practice for an hour and a half, going up and down in elevator, your amygdala is going to go, you know, nothing has happened. I guess it's okay and that's what we call within-session habituation. That's what now we want between-session habituation, but it's that, setting amygdala there and doing fine. Now, I worked with somebody on Monday, who had -- has OCD and she washes her hands 200 to 300 times per day. She came in and saw me, we had an interview and we within 45 minutes we're in the kitchen, she was -- as I asked her what were her, you know, what was the look around the kitchen was my kitchen or her kitchen. What if the things here are the highest on your hierarchy and she was naming them the counter that sponge over there, the floor and then -- and I say we'll check up the sink and as she checks the sink, she says okay the sink is probably the highest. All right, great let's practice, I would like you to practice on the sink, is that okay, would you start on the highest of my hierarchy, well, you know where we'd got into in our conversation is the content is irrelevant. Why shouldn't I go to the top of the hierarchy, so she took her hands and she wiped all around the inside, including that little brown spot that I said might be they're teen age sons not to dry it on there and she rubbed that little, little. Rubbed her hands together, I asked her to touch your clothes, she touched her cloth, I asked her to touch your face, she started screaming I said put your game face on. Game faces, I'm up to big things, I want to get back to one of my daughter, I want to engage in my family you know so the game faces, I'm serious you did all of that and smiled with it. Now for the last three days, she used to do some practice and so forth and send me an email, let me know how many points she scored, zero points, can't do it. Because we are not there, could do it in the moment with me, now I'm supposed to see her tomorrow and I'm not sure she will be there. We will find out, but she would have been said, I have failed you, but that's how it go, I failed you, right. I have wasted your time, so I've graveled in my email back and try to get her. So that's within-session habituation and of course you want to be do it in overtime. Are you okay about the idea about the amygdala and how it learns. And we have to get out of its way and yes ma'am? You say I talked about duration, but I talked about intensity duration and I talked about frequency, what do you want to know about frequency? You want to practice as much -- that well, we talked about the hospital program as they practiced all day and all night. So that's constant frequency, we want to practice as often as possible. Some of these are afraid to fly, only flies every three months, it's not frequent enough. Go ahead.

REID WILSON So what's a reasonable exception? I'm seeing them once a week and then they're doing homework. The reasonable expectation is try to -- if you would stay with me around score as many points as possible. That's just you're going to practice just -- I'm looking for opportunity, that's the attitude. I'm looking for opportunities to score points, because the more -- so that's the attitude I want to get with them and then they come in this women I gave for her a tally counter. You know every time you practice and I'll tell you as the practice goes you click the counter and you score the point and so I'm going to give her some props to help her do that. Obviously didn't help her enough, but expectations, having seen somebody for 45 minutes and that engaged already is hard, but just you want your job is to pump them up to practice as much as possible. So she stop putting gaps in there, their believe system starts to come back in, so I want him to go and I'd like to have people email me, let me know how it's going or for some people I say please email me, if you don't practice because I'm a nice enough guy, but some people would rather practice and not have to contact me, so I'll work on it how I can. Werner Erhard, remember who he is? He created est to became the forum to white-collar cult, but Erhard said you want to hit the bulls eye every time, throw your dart first and then draw your circles around it, right. And that's what we're talking about in doing this work. This is my distress, okay, well, I'm going to go toward that and this is what I want. This is what I feel, this is what I want. What I want them, as we talked about it, how is it going, how we doing, you with me, because it's kind of hard to reach all 600 of you, but I hope I'm relating they're filming, they don't know, there is only four of you here. So we got the game, so we're going to -- we're pursuing this game and -- I want to know your challenger comes into the game as though it's the official. Your challenger OCD gives you the rules of the game absolutely, totally understand this. They completely get this and it gives you rules that guarantees it will win every time. And I show them the rules and I'll say her do you follow this rule and you know the first rule is this be careful or you may cause a terrible problem or be aware that you already have. You asked your client this ago, yeah that's it. Okay, that's the rule, the OCD. That's what they're following; they're biting by this rule. The second rule is, this is the first thought that pops up is the most relevant thought and in an anxious situation, so here we are in a fearful thought pops up, take it seriously and must mean something. I'm working with a women now, really bright, competent, health professional, she is a checker. She is afraid that she has run someone over or -- gone they're pulled into the land and caused a car to have an accident, hit the pedestrian in the parking deck or whatever and I have, you know, she did my intensive treatment group now. Here is what I say to people who come to see me, I'm going to give you about four guidelines or so and if you would do it, I ask you to do, I guarantee you, you will get better, ever said that to your patient. Guarantee you, if you will do this, you will get better, but I say that pretty much regularly. I'm not saying you get best, but you can help about get better, when you stop following these rules, I'm going to give you guidelines, they're going to observe this. So this woman, health professional, again, I saw her in the weekend tribute group, now I see her once a month, because she is not better and where I'm stuck with her is that as she drives on after some stimulus, she starts to feel guilty. And she cannot tolerate feeling guilty without turning back around and checking. If I'm feeling guilty there should be a reason that I'm feeling guilty and I'm -- I can promise you I'm a relatively clever cap and I'm not moving that particular piece, right. And this is literally what we'd call thought action fusion, this is why people think well, I think I just had a flash of a child or I think I just brushed up against it, if I had a thought or an image like that, I must be the kind of person who would do something wrong to a child. So that's rule number two, everybody is going to say, yes I follow that. Rule number three, be absolutely certain, yes, I follow that. I have to be sure, I can't let it go and lastly, the example I just gave is you know, around guilt you use your anxiety as a gauge, she use her guilt as a gauge, hoarding uses a anticipated regret as a gauge and that's an indication of danger. The last one is the biggest one in terms of what they tend to do which is always act defensively and they all do. They back up and so forth and what we want to know about, with a game is there is no earthly way. You can win a game, if your entire strategy is defensive. So if you follow me up to this point, they really get this peace. No earthly way, you can win a competition if you only are defensive. So we're going have to talk about offensive strategy. The problem with an offensive strategy is you are stepping out of your safe zone. You are stepping out of your comfort and you are -- and so here we have people who are coming to see us and who are suffering and want to get out of their suffering, but do not want to change, because they don't want to experience uncertainty and that's the conundrum that we are in and we have to understand that because they don't get that. So this process would be like if you and I were -- you are naive that how to play basketball and I was going to play one on one with you in basketball. I'll say look here is how you play basketball, anytime you see me with that big orange ball dribbling, you are too freeze and drop your hands to your side and to you see the ball go through the net. Then, you can move, okay, let's play, right. If you're naive about how to play cards, I'm going to play cards with you, I'm going to say look, this is how you play cards. If you draw a card from the deck and it matches in number or suit, anything in your hand, you are to discard that. Okay, let's play that is the game. And they will get this, if you can present it in this way congruently, right. You just have to act as though you know what you’re talking about. This is me because this a coaching, as you know, professional athletes who fly over the country and pay really big bucks to get a coach to train them to be a better athlete. And if the coach you know they come out to work out and coach says hey look I want you to do the stadium stairs once and then we’re going to do some wind sprints out here in the foot field. The likelihood is that the athlete to come up and go. You know couch I got a little bellyache today, I wonder if we could do something different, they just so, yes ma’am I’m on it. Be nice if you would treat me that way as your therapist right. Just but not counting on it necessarily, so here is what we would say would be their winning strategies. The first is, don’t pay attention to your contempt. You’re going to get sucked into that contempt absolutely and you've got a backup. And if you not going to pay attention and then you're going to see a quote from Daniel Goldman about this. If you're not going to pay attention in your contempt, you’re going to get pretty freaked out, but it’s not about your contempt. It’s never about your contempt, this one is the one that you’ll have the most trouble with. When you're having difficulty with somebody with OCD come back to this one because they worship at the altar of the contempt. And very often what happens is you treat people with OCD and they get about a third better maybe half better, they drop out of treatment. And they drop out of treatment because they've gotten rid of all the low grades stuff now they left with the big stuff. I’ll give some examples in little while of people who have either succeeded with or more likely failed with and so. It’s not about contempt, but purposely feeling a generic sense of uncertainties, so part of the way I talk about as you know if you're going to the contempt just like picking up garbage all day long, you’re going to bending over and picking up garbage. As you picking up this garbage, as soon as you bend over and go to contempt so I do it physically in terms of this gestures, you bend over and pick up contempt, there is no worthy way you're going to win anything at this point. Now you and I, client and I actually will grab contempt in order to generate the generic experience. So I’m looking to feel uncertain about, you know how to fill in the blank, just trying to get uncertain about my theme but not about what’s going on at this particular moment. So here is Goldman's quote -- I love this quote, a person prevails over anxiety by sacrificing attention. This is what they do not want to do. And is we want to ask them to do. And is the moment-by-moment experience of either absorption or dissociation – absorption and dissociation those of you who have been doing hypnosis, this is what you’ve been doing. You teach somebody or you going to do a induction with someone and do hand levitation. You know, they're consciously aware of what you're saying and you keep saying, before you know that your hand is going to pressed up against this your cheek and they're going -- why is she saying that, that’s like a really weird thing to say it, but gradually as you keep making suggestions. You know the hand comes up and starts floating whether it goes to the cheek as your relevant, but now it’s floating up here and its dissociated and then your therapist says you can open your eyes and you can look at that and you go or now you mesmerize, right Mesmer, so this is really weird because I know for sure, I didn’t do anything and here it is it feels disconnected to myself now I am absorbed ironically absorbed in this dissociative experience, I'm dissociated from everything else that’s going on, you sitting over here to my right can give me suggestions therapeutically that I will have little resistance to. Because I’m chewing up consciousness being so interested in this experience and so that’s what going on with somebody with OCD, they're absorbed in the fear washing by hands 200 and 300 times a day dissociated from my two daughters, from my husband, I can’t work, I can’t barely concentrate on cooking. The only thing I know to do is to drink alcohol and so four o'clock at night I started drinking a bottle of champagne every single night I wake up in the middle of night, I feel guilty and ashamed and I beat myself up and then we start over again the next day. So we are, what we want to do again since we are not extinguishing the fearful thoughts is the fearful thoughts are going to come up, we’re going to bring another voice up and position up, we are going to have them absorb themselves into this, even if they're clumsy what we’re asking them to do. If they will try to be a good student of the work this is a zero sum game as you will see and this stuff will start to fade, I will show you that on the slide relatively soon. So we want them to absorb themselves in how to apply the principles in this moment. I got a tally counter, here’s I've just encountered on purpose my threat. I’m going to try to figure out what the principle is to apply in this moment, so I can click the tally counter and get a point. You get a point by generating the uncertainty and then generating a position in relationship to the uncertainty, what I say to all my clients with any anxiety disorder is we are not working on your symptoms, we are working on your relationship to your symptoms. Your symptoms will dissipate on their own. You’re not in control of getting rid of your symptoms, it's bad form to be doing what you and I talking about in order to get rid of your symptoms. Of course if we step out of the box and look at it from a distance, I make my living on people getting rid of symptoms and of course, you pay me money to help you get rid of it. But in the moment when we're doing the work, you need to get that off your agenda again, very difficult thing to turn around, but if they can turn it around you saw the data what happens. So, am I going to focus on this or am I going to focus on getting rid of my doubt and distress. It’s where you put your tension here it is. Am I going to be awkward and clumsy and insecure and afraid or am I going to try to figure out, whether I just harm somebody or my hands are contaminated or I’m -- I have made some terror mistake written screw you on the check instead of my name and, you know, go back -- I had a client take a stick. But, gum on the end of it, try to retrieve their letter out of the mail box that they might have written a bad word on the chat, they could have gotten arrested half or so, we're going to either focus here, focus here right. Second, make set your obsession when it pops up. You only have two choices, you either accept it or you resist it. The reason you accept it is it's noise, it's meaningless, purposeless has no function. If you think it's purposeful, you can't accept it, but since it's nothing that’s why you're going to accept, you're going to accept it because, I got OCD, this is what we do. We generate thoughts, images or feelings that freak us out and I’m doing it now that’s okay with me. Because, the other choice is to refight it and that’s just going to dig pretty deep hole for me. And we know these two right. Third is, want to get uncertain and then you got to have number four because it's going be right there anyway. You know so. Oh okay, so we’re half way through, my intimacy would be just to keep going and finished just opposed to take a 10-minute break and then come start again. Do we agree? did you take your personal break when everyone pretended to break and never come back, however you want to do it perfectly follow me there is still 600 people even if you leave doesn't really matter. Five is you got to have rules, for a lot of people you have to have rules about how to perform certain tasks. If you are, you know if you are afraid to salmonella then you've got be willing to have a rule about how to clean your nails and other utensils and your cutting board before you start cutting up your vegetables. so it has to be rule. If you're washing cleaner, afraid to washing your hands in seasonally you got to have rule for how long you wash. And you get to decide, my clients get to decide how long they want to wash. My clients got to decide how many times they check the front door before they walk out to go to work, I don’t care if they check front four five times. If then I mean that’s a little excessive, but if it's down from twenty, it's great to practice as long as it's stimulating somewhat, uncertain some little uncertainty and then they're practicing. So, you know, ideally we do what washing hands in soap and warm water for twenty seconds, so you can have your clients decide, okay I’m going to wash my hands while I’m singing happy birthday inside my mind, and I’m not allowed to do a second verse you know and you smell like one too you just do, as soon as you get past the first verse you haven’t take your hands out of the water, then you know you're doing a compulsion and you want to be figure it out what your intervention is going to be. You probably don’t have a handout, do you? So, if you have a handout, don’t look ahead, he and me it looks ahead, don’t look I have solstice work we know so far. This is how might sound in the moment, when our clients working, and I want to see if you from getting through to you, let’s see what you come up with here. So, what’s in gold not in yellow, because yellow implies chicken and these people aren't chicken this is gold. So somebody with OCD would think did I do something wrong, so that is what an obsession, right. So, the next thing that pops up is going to be the urge to do the compulsion. Oh, no I got to find out. Now, what’s going to come up next and why it is reasonable fact similarly of what they might say in the moment from what we've been talked about so far, when I say we -- you got to guess of what might come up or be a reasonable fact somebody to come up on this next line here, they would be therapeutic when you become uncertain and have an urge to do a compulsion, speak up fear. Okay, but this is a therapeutic response, what do you want to say to yourself at that moment. Say it again, I want to win the game, okay, anybody else have a different one. Sorry, it’s a thought. Okay, do anyone have another guess any. Yeah, it's just OCD yes. Maybe, I did do some more on but okay, good. So, I'm going to throw up one just like that one. And its good, just have this thought, that gives me an early and so there is my obsession, good, I’m looking for an obsession, that’s why I’m looking okay, good I hear some, I get practice now, whereas the point is, I’m now getting to -- we need frequency intensity and duration, good, I just had an obsession. Now, I get the maybe, I did, maybe I didn't tease. In the way we would want kind of clean that up is, I don’t know, whether I did or I didn’t and that’s okay with me to not know, not good, I mean it actually be burning down the house, right now well I’m at work. That’s fine with me, because that content. So, we not reassuring ourselves, we are not like a good you know maybe I ran somebody over, but it was probably the evil person, they needed to be killed that’s we're not doing that particular. So, it’s good because, I got that generic uncertainty, now what if you say that, what you're doing is letting go of a defense. Right, because the compulsion to find out is their defensive strategy. So, now we’ve got a therapeutic response that makes them feel defenseless, then how are you going to feel, when you think your defenseless. Anxious, so they’re going to get scared. When they get scared, what might we suggest they say, anybody want to make a guess, what might come up next. It's okay o feel scared speak up louder, bring it on, excellent, anything else. I want to feel scare, so here it is my reasonable fact, good I’m looking to anxious too, as we go up here, difficult for them to do, very difficult for them to do, if they really believes the contempt is important right. Sitting, standing in the kitchen, on Tuesday with the client doing that she didn’t think the contempt was a relevant, go home, when I’m not there and I’m not compound in a way, I don't all, so she forgets that, right? So, let’s try another one see if you what you've got or this an interesting line. Because, this is very common with OCD, this is the way your client will say. Is this an OCD event, because if it’s an OCD event, I know what to do, I need to go toward it and they want to be uncertain, but this actually might -- this might not be OCD, I might actually have left the stove on, you know the gas stove, like four years ago I remember leaning up against the stove and buff it all of a sudden came on fire, I’ve just might be right there they go, right. So, all of our sudden under the hospices, I’m evaluating whether, this is an OCD moment to know whether I should practice, I’m obsessing and doing a compulsion. So, the rule would be, so here we are right, I need to find out we're going to have that same kind of response, here is the rule I give to people. If the obsession is one of my themes and they know, what their themes are, you know what their themes are, because you've outlined them if it’s about, washing or my children or whatever it is. And, I don’t know if it’s, you know, obsessive moment or not, but the thought makes me anxious, I’m going to air on the side of it be an OCD. I’m going to treat it like OCD. So, if they treat that thought like it’s an obsessive font, what’s the risk. I could be wrong, that there was an OCD at moment, it was actually serious, so, and it's always going to be that way and here is the tricky thing and if I can even convey it to you, it’s hard to convey to clients too. This is a disorder of uncertainty, so that’s certainties around the brain won’t close, which means they can't know that what we’re telling them is right. They can't know that this behavior is their proper thing to do, because they can’t get closer that’s a really tricky part of the disorder. And that’s why we want plausible, that’s why they need to trust you in doing the work and that's a difficult thing to do, and they will come back, you will come back around this a number of time with most people you see around, you just can't, you can’t have that. I would give it to you if I could, that’s why it takes courage to do the work. So, we got this is hard, I want it, and I can handle it. You know remember the graphic we had before the big window, right that’s the point of view, now we're down to what? A film frame, and the frame indicates this is why we want them to do in moment-by-moment. When you believe that just like with panic disorder it’s okay for me to have a panic attack, why because I can handle having a panic attack if they don’t feel like an handle, they can't say that. And if we have a very simple equation of threat it would be cost, how bad it's going to be divided by self-efficacy high(ph) amorous term my ability to cope with it. To a degree we can work on coping ability is the degree that you know nominated, this is the denominator on the bottom and the numerator on top. So if we can built the denominator then the numerator -- the number is going to go down because the threat is going to be more tolerable, I can manage it. So, that’s what we're assuring for, I can give you examples in a minute about this issue around threat, but basically it's about if we don’t get them to stop catastrophizing, then it's going to be very difficult to do the work, this what Albert Ellis would say, you know if you're going to do this, you're going to step up there and give that talk and people are going to criticize you, if you are going to be humiliated by that it's tough to tolerate, but if you can down grade that to be an embarrassed about or you can tolerate being embarrassed. I got embarrassed yesterday in one of the dialogs or panels that I was a part of, but I struggled with being humiliated, and I didn't sleep very well because I was going into the feeling a sense of humiliation and I have had to really work all day today too around not being humiliated but being embarrassed by him, her or it. So, I can handle it if the hit's not too big and I can take the hit if it's not too big and I can cope with the less you know example if I don’t wash my hands, I’m going to get sick or I’m going to make somebody else sick, you know if I don’t wash my hands, if I really don’t wash my hands today and I’m contaminated with the flu virus and I get the flu, I can’t, I’m not interested not yet all I’m going to wash my hands because I can’t afford to be sick for 10 days, because I’m an important person, I’ve got things to do, you know, so, I can’t handle if that’s what’s happening. However what we want to be sifting them to say is, if I don’t wash my hands I’m going to feel uncertain and anxious. I don’t like that, but that I can cope with. But, if I escalate it up to, oh, oh, you know, I’m going to harm somebody, if imagine something inappropriate that means I’m a bad person, I can’t handle that that’s terrible, what does this mean, I got to fix this I can have those thoughts. If it’s just that I’m just, it’s not easy to be uncertain and uncomfortable, if that’s what it is, I will -- I can figure out how to handle that. Now some people are going to come to you and they are going to go yep, what if it does happen, what if -- how can you wish all that kind of reassurance that they want and my answer tell this is, you know my gesture is this right. Oh well, I can’t get closer, you know this is, no you're not Canadian, oh you know it is Sue Johanson, no sex with Sue, sounds provocative doesn't it, yeah, yeah okay. So, that is founded on the internet because she was doing that, and I’m tried to give a graphic of that will happen to be Sue Johanson no other meaning in there, I promise you. Even though, Sue was thinking there was meaning in that. So, how do you overcome OCD, do anything other than resist and doubt, change your frame of reference, let's talked about frame up the action. Now, I’m going to take 10 minutes to say something the people if heard me say if they heard it three days ago because I took it out of here and put it in there for you, so just keep in mind I have that yesterday it should have been here don’t punish me. So, framing up the action is taking that point of view and bringing it down to the moment and telling myself what to do. And this is what I was never been saying about mindfulness, mindfulness is useful, but insufficient when you are threaten you need to tell yourself what to do, and that’s part of what we are talking about here. Now, I’ve got a little bones grandchild, I’ve my a first grandchild coming in February, which I’m excited about it in LA, while I live in North Carolina, but I have got three bonus grandchildren, you know they aren't step grand children, bonus grand -- yeah bonus. So, Jones my little bonus grandchild when he was two years old. You know Jones, give me that back, no, no you can’t put the strawberry in your mouth like that, now take, take a small bite, just take a bite and chew that. At three, he can pick up a strawberry take a bite and go, just take a bite. Right, he’s got that he's learning. If we all of us know how to do this, all of us have these unconscious messages like this one be polite and respect for here. You know if tonight you go out and have a nice dinner and to celebrate how you much you learned in this talk maybe 550 of you will have a couple of glasses of wine, and then as you drive in home that will blue and red light come in a rear of your mirror. And you pull over and the police officer comes up to you, it’s really best not to open the door and grab the gun from them or shove them or call them a bad name, you just -- but we know that, right? If you are going to have dinner with your fiance's parents for the first time, you know already to be polite that you don’t talk about politics, you don’t talk about religion, you don’t talk about how good sex was last night those you were just off the list, right. So, those are unconscious, we all know how to do it, our clients no had it do it, but with OCD in these moments, they are going to have to be conscious about it and that’s the training that we want to bring forward. And it is this you know framing up the action that supports us stepping toward the threat, instead of away from it. So, if we are stepping this is my list that I think is what we do, when we step towards a challenge. Now, is anybody in the audience ever studied for an exam that gave them a license that allow them to begin their carrier, if you had just raise your hand, okay. So, everybody is had some kind of struggle they have gone through, if you've had a physical injury and had to return to full functioning, you have to learn, you know any kind of new skill and so forth. Here is the kind of things I think are required to face and the reason I’m giving you this list is this is what I think they need do. The first one is you have to refuse to be certain and comfortable. There is no way in the world you could learn anything new is that is on your agenda. The second thing is you got to step towards the task you got to do it and you got to invest in it, you got to clock in the time, you got to sacrifice and so forth, you got to risk losing something that you have that's kind of thought to give up your money, your time, I just remember reading a colleague who said dedication in his book and he said, I dedicate this to my wife and children without whom I would have finished this book a year sooner. So, but you know we have to give up time with people and so forth despite what he or she is said, you got to be willing to be influenced by the moment and environment so forth, this is how assume what you do and what I do, look over our notes, before we going and see our client, have a general sense what we're going to do next with them and then we sit down quiet and see what happens and then we respond to what comes up and modify our intension based on that. And then you got a be willing to be satisfied if the world doesn’t bend your wishes, I’m trying to get this women to come back into treatment who says she not coming back. She lost this little battle, but if you lose that battle just push the game board away, pull up a new game board and start again, unless wipe the slate clean and start scoring points in a new game. You like that graphic, you know if you didn’t see it, lets just do that again. People live on cobblestone streets are healthier physically and mentally, because they're walking on cobblestones everyday and that requires to get the vestibular system in balance and requires the cardiovascular system to be imbalanced, but that’s not what we tend to do, we tend to look first move hard ways, make everything easy for us and it’s not going to work in general, you need to be awkward and clumsy and uncertain in general. And all the people we work with, with OCD, know how to be awkward and uncertain and you know scared in other arenas, so we are not trying to teach them something new and this whole talk is about to the harder persuasion and just orient as around all of this from permissive point of view, open discussion and so forth. We can move right on down to giving the comment and that’s what we are talking about now which is in a threatening situation we give ourselves commands. This is remember don’t fire until you see the whites of their eyes. This was anybody remember, who this was, who said this? Prescott. Why did he you say this, because the Americans are running out of bullets and if they started to fire at the redcoats, when their emotions were telling them, oh, my god I don’t want to be killed they would be firing 150 yards away and miss, they want to make sure every short counts, so they have to override instinct and wait until they're on top of them with fixed bayonets and then fire every group that faces that kind of thread is trained to operate on commands. Police officers, fire fitters, military, you step in the cockpit of a plane and those pilots have about 85 checks that they do back and forth with each other residing things, responding to it that’s the kind of stuff we are talking about. My brother ran for Duke, he was on Duke and his job was in part in cross country to learn how to take hills and his model was to run hills hard, his coach was one of the best coaches in the county at the time Al Buehler and Al Buehler's job was to you know here is back up. Step one, whatever clients trying to accomplish, what’s the strategy, you know which is go toward uncertainty about my theme and go to my stress and worry and anxiety about my theme. Now I've got to say you something to get myself to do it. And then I got a go-ahead and start speak in those once I figure it out. Here is how you take the physics of taking the hill. These four things that we want to do. Now coach Buehler gives my brother this, my brother comes up with statements to get himself to take those hills hard including looking five to six feet in front of him why would he say that to himself, look five or six feet in front of him, not to make sure he doesn’t trip, but because we just trying to get us head down and his gravity over, so we can take that hill. As he's learning to take hills, he’s using all these comments until they become automatic. And once they come in automatic, he peals them off and he ends up saying run hills hard and at all the other messages get turned over to the unconscious that’s what we’re doing here. I’m giving two steps of commends right now, one is and the two steps of messages, one is motivational messages in the moment, right. I want my life back this is a good opportunity to practice, you know, you’ll recognize some of these you see might turn if I can take the hits, got a be willing to tolerate uncertainty. Willing to be clumsy and then somebody already said this one give me a best short alright. The second type of message is the command, tell yourself what to do, pass yourself around if you have to, because you got an urge to run away, you got to get yourself to stand still, you guy's okay seeing this little clip, video clip again. Raise your hand if you saw at the first time, okay so you will know when to gasp. Okay, I apologize for doing it second time, but hey I’m not that smart. So, I’m going to show you a little clip that half of you have seen, you have a question, say it again. It’s a YouTube clip that I can’t find any more. But if you want to try to do the search terms you will get it. So, the reason I’m going to show this one minute clip is because it’s a good example of a little 11 year old girl telling herself what to do in a threatening situation. I want you to get this piece because this is what you need to be passing on to your client. And so and going through the dialogue with you because its goes by so fast. I want you to hear it and know what’s going on. So, she is in white, I’ll be fine, also here it is 60 meter jump. She’s done 20 meters already in this class. This is her first time doing a 60 meter jump and she's scared, really scared. I’ll be fine, her couch, instructor, teacher have fun, I’ll do it. Well, here goes something I guess you can do this. I’m going to jump. You got it, well. So, here she is going see -- her camera is on her helmet is looking out all the time metaphorically that’s we want to look forward, look ahead, look at my goals, go there. Then, what I was saying before, when people get anxious, their focus narrows to something really tight, right in here that’s why if your rational for what you doing is this long-term practice your missing that they're here. You're going see her, one ski moves and immediately her head goes down there, she gets scared, she’s got to bring her head back up and get oriented again. So, exactly what our clients are going to do. They are going to get scared by and remember to snap out of it. Right, so now he says, just remember no snow plows okay, no snow plows, she instruct herself. Just keep it straight, you’ll be fine, do the same thing you did on the 20. Reminding her for her success, having done that all the jump. Okay, straight, do go faster on the end run, a little bit, a little bit, yeah, is it any steeper you think, same steepness as just longer, just longer, just longer, it’s a just a bigger 20 that’s all. Yep, have fun it’s just a bigger 20. Go ahead, you got this. I got this, you’ll be fine. Okay here I go. And, people who have already seen this know that she dies at the end. But it is a useful thing to see anywhere around the courage that she has. So, here are her buddies way down here that’s where we're going, here the other snow plows that have gone on, I don't know, maybe they claimed back up the hill, I’m not sure that’s kind of backwards snow plow. So, we are going to watch this for a second and I turnoff the lights except I'm too far away. 

01:38:05
 I’ll be fine, 

01:38:05
 Have fun. 

01:38:05
 I’ll do it. 

01:38:10
 Wow, here goes something, I guess, okay, you can do this. I’m going to jump. 

01:38:30
 You got it. 

01:38:30
 Oh, my ski is slipping off. 

01:38:30
 Remember, never snow plow okay. 

01:38:35
 No, snow plows. 

01:38:35
 Keep it straight, and you’ll be fine. 

01:38:35
 Okay. 

01:38:35
 Straight, do you go faster on the end run. 

01:38:40
 Little bit 

01:38:40
 A little bit 

01:38:40
 Yeah. 

01:38:45
 Is it any steeper do you thing, not much. 

01:38:45
 Same steepness, it's just longer. 

01:38:45
 Oh, just longer, just longer, just a bigger 20 that’s all. 

01:38:50
 Yep, have fun. 

01:38:55
 It’s a bigger 20. I got it. 

01:39:05
 It's fine. You will be fine. 

01:39:10
 Okay. Here. 

01:39:10
 Well, on the way will be more scare. 

01:39:15
 I go. 

01:39:20
[sil.] 

01:39:40
 Just a suspense at the top of the first time for ETL, that's the only thing -- fallen. 60 seems like nothing now. Wow! 

01:39:55
REID WILSON She's great. So now, so this is a sheet I hand out to everybody, that I'd see basically and really want to hand it out to and that's all in different forms and so forth. And they're just examples of messages that I might give myself as I'm going to do my practice and I might ask them, as I see it the first time to take a few minutes and just circle a couple on there, that they would want to use in the next week as they do their practice. So, that's therefore when you get the slides. Here, I'm just say, you know, not only do, I want to be give in myself commands, but sometime as somebody was suggesting, I want to be relatively aggressive. This is an aggressive sport. So, I'm going to have to go a little stronger around saying give me your best shot, is that all you got. All right, so I am personified externalizing critical to externalize it and then be able to talk to it in that way. The other thing is to be taking back, your territory by acting and I, so here is the game this is how when I am working with my groups particularly this is the score card I give, the instructions for scoring points. So, my job is to look for chances to feel doubt and distress. So, is that instruction, is that behavior therapy, look for chances to get uncertain and distressed. It's not behavior therapy, it's not exposure, because exposure would be go get anxious and distress. What we want to look at, is this opening term here, which is look for chances that's the attitude shift. I want them to take ownership and I am looking for sniff around whereas another place today, that I can practice, so when you are saying, how frequently should they practice, this is what I mean around, but it's more the attitude to keep going, now as they come back in, they said, we've did eight practices over seven days. That's probably not frequent enough we'd want them to up that is they can. When people come back and put their first numbers up, they put it up on the board on the newsprint and their numbers after the first launches, you know twelve, nine, fourteen way too low, way too low. So you score a point, you go out and you are start trying to do these things. Can I find some doubt here? I’m going to be, can't be willing to be uncertain and anxious. Can I invite OCD to make it strong, can I invite it to make it last longer. You score a point by stimulating your threat or your anxiety and then have no response, there is either motivating or command like come on give more that's not enough, I'm not anxious enough. And so I'm giving them suggestion here to do, but they can use any statement they want, that does and you don't score a point. This is where they get lost, score point by going and doing the exposure. You always score point if you are also pairing up the exposure with this message. So, that's this pushing back around either asking -- provoking but having a provoking request or paradoxical request rather not enough. I told this story before at the bottom, so I’m not tell it again, that's what a tally counter looks like, if you have never seen one, you can get it, this is the United States right. Staples has them for $4 just by the way, and so, don't get the $8 one you were getting before.
