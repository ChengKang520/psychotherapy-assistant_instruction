Stage One of EFT for Couples 

00:00:15
Sue Johnson, EdD 

00:00:15
DR. SUE JOHNSON  Hi, everybody. 

00:00:40
UNKNOWN Hi. 

00:00:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON I'm Sue Johnson, and this is a clinical demonstration of Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy. So we have a wonderful couple who've agreed to come up here and talk to me today; they've never met me before, so, uh, I think this is a very brave thing for them to do. We have Earl and Stephanie. Thank you, guys. I appreciate you. You're giving a big gift to all these people. Okay, and -- and to lots of other couples, because these people are all therapists, they're going to go back and work with other couples. So you're giving a huge gift and we appreciate you for doing this. So, um, um, Earl and Stephanie are in EFT, uh, with a local therapist, Nell, who has very kindly agreed to bring them here. So, um, they already know the model, so I'm not going to sit down and talk to them about the model. And, um, they've just read "Hold Me Tight", and we'll talk about that in a minute. Uh, so that's, uh -- that's great. That's great preparation here. Um, I would like you, as you watch me work, to think about that the two tasks of EFT are working with emotion, okay, helping people move into their emotion, regulate their emotion, um, make it coherent, ordered, understandable, being able to -- to give clear signals to their partner, right? So I'd like you to think about -- hopefully, you're going to see me doing that. And the other part of EFT is creating -- uh, shaping interactions, right? So when people give clear messages to their partner, they create certain responses in their partner, they help mold their partner's steps in the dance. So you're going to, um, see me working with interactions and, hopefully, shaping some new interaction patterns. In your, um, brochure, it says that this is stage one of EFT, which is all about deescalating negative patterns. I'm not quite sure if this is going to be stage one of EFT, because I'm not quite sure, when I sit down with, uh, Stephanie and Earl, quite where they're at right now. Okay? So we can have some leeway about that as to whether I'm -- if you know the model, whether I'm working in stage one or whether I'm actually starting to go down into stage two. So we're going to work for maybe, uh, 50 minutes or so, and then hopefully somebody will tell me to stop, because I'm sort of like a runaway train sometimes; I just keep going. So somebody has to stand up and say "Stop." So then I'm going to stop and, uh, hopefully at the end, maybe I'll be able to ask these guys what it was like for them to do this, and we might even have time for a couple of questions. If not at the end, I'll stand outside for people so that if you see something that you want to talk to me about, you're most welcome to talk and talk to me just after the session. Yes? All right. Okay. How you guys doing? 

00:03:50
EARL Uh, nervous. 

00:03:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON  Well, it's pretty strange, right -- 

00:03:55
EARL Yeah, it's -- 

00:03:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- to talk to a stranger that you never met before, about something as precious as your closest relationship? So I really appreciate you, um, honoring me by letting me in like this. Okay? All right, so I don't know if there's any way I can help you feel a little safer. Is there something that you'd like -- like, we met out in the foyer, right? So I asked you this once before, but is there any way that I can help you feel a little safer here? Is there something you'd like to ask me, or -- I'm going to write down some of the things you say; I usually do that. I just write down the exact words you say, okay, because they're so important I want to remember them. So I know that you guys have, um, been doing EFT for a little while and, um, I know that you've just read "Hold Me Tight". Right? Okay, so you mentioned something out to me in the hall that you've -- literally, you've just read "Hold Me Tight" in the last couple of days, haven't you? 

00:05:00
EARL Just recently, yes. 

00:05:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON Okay. And you said something about, to me, that you felt that -- um, Earl, you said something like that somehow reading "Hold Me Tight" had sort of brought something together for you guys, that that had -- 

00:05:10
EARL We kind of see, uh, the background behind some of the reasons that -- that we -- we've had the marital difficulties that we had, you know, the -- the reason behind it, it's -- I used the analogy with, uh -- with Sue here that it's -- it's sort of like a baby crying: You don't know why it's crying or what it's trying to achieve. And -- and -- and apparently our battles were just like that: We didn't know exactly what was driving us and -- but at least that's what it seemed like to me. 

00:05:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON That's a really fascinating image, a baby crying, yeah. But that's what you understood from -- from reading "Hold Me Tight"; what you got was that underneath your -- your guys' regular dance, there was something really emotional going on -- 

00:06:00
EARL Yes. 

00:06:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- right, like there is when a baby cries -- 

00:06:00
EARL Um-hum. 

00:06:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- yeah? That somehow underneath your dance, there was a -- a cry, that you were cry -- both crying for something, that there was some pain there, yeah? 

00:06:10
EARL Yes. 

00:06:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON Okay. And what about you, Stephanie? You -- you read the book too, right? 

00:06:15
STEPHANIE I did. I did. Um, I feel the same way he did. I think -- I don't know that I was as clueless as he -- I mean, I don't know how to say it. He -- he really didn't -- 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN No mic. It's not working. 

00:06:35
STEPHANIE My mic's still not working. 

00:06:40
EARL Keep -- keep talking. Is that -- 

00:06:45
STEPHANIE Okay. Is it working now? 

00:06:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON No. 

00:06:50
EARL Keep talking. Keep talking. 

00:06:50
STEPHANIE I'm talking. Test, test. Test, test. 

00:06:55
EARL Nope. 

00:07:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON Um, I don't -- I don't think it's working, folks. Let's just do the handheld. Is the hand -- but the handheld wasn't working either. I'm sorry, Stephanie, to ask you to do that. 

00:07:10
STEPHANIE That's okay. Okay, that -- okay. 

00:07:15
DR. SUE JOHNSON Is that okay for you? 

00:07:15
STEPHANIE It is. 

00:07:15
DR. SUE JOHNSON All right. It's all about connection, you see. 

00:07:25
EARL Or lack therein. 

00:07:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON It's connection, right? You just -- 

00:07:35
[sil.] 

00:07:35
EARL You may have to stick it underneath your hair. 

00:07:40
STEPHANIE Oh my gosh, this is really -- 

00:07:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON Can I help you? 

00:07:45
STEPHANIE Yeah, my hair's just, like, getting away. 

00:07:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON It's alright. It's okay. There you go. 

00:07:50
STEPHANIE (inaudible ) 

00:07:52
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah, I think so. 

00:07:52
STEPHANIE Hair, glasses. 

00:07:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah. I think -- yeah? Got it. 

00:08:00
STEPHANIE Is it -- 

00:08:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah, but is it working? 

00:08:00
STEPHANIE Is it working? Oh my goodness, it doesn't sound like it. Test, test. 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN Place it near your mouth. 

00:08:05
EARL Keep -- 

00:08:05
STEPHANIE Test. 

00:08:05
EARL Keep -- 

00:08:10
STEPHANIE Test. Okay -- 

00:08:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON There. 

00:08:10
STEPHANIE -- there we go. Okay. Oh my goodness. 

00:08:15
DR. SUE JOHNSON See, they're -- they're all behind you here. See, they're all -- 

00:08:15
STEPHANIE I know. I -- they -- that's good. 

00:08:15
DR. SUE JOHNSON Okay. They're -- 

00:08:20
STEPHANIE Okay. 

00:08:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON They're all supporting you, right? 

00:08:20
STEPHANIE Okay. 

00:08:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON Okay. So you said, what, that you -- 

00:08:25
STEPHANIE Well, maybe I should take back what I said. I -- I realize a lot -- I think -- I think, in reading it, I've realized a lot about myself and how I -- I -- I've figured a lot of my deepest emotions and things that I -- I didn't realize. I always thought I knew where everything was and that I was right and that he just didn't -- he chose not to get me. And I just had no idea that I wasn't coming across right and that he -- you know, I didn't have any clue how he really felt about everything. And it's -- it's just opened my eyes up to how -- you know, how deep his emotions went, I think, and how -- how, um -- 

00:09:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON So you help me. What you're saying is, 'Sue, I didn't really understand how I was coming across, and I didn't understand the impact that I was having on -- on Earl'? 

00:09:20
STEPHANIE Right. 

00:09:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah? 

00:09:20
STEPHANIE Right. Right. 

00:09:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right? 

00:09:25
STEPHANIE Right. 

00:09:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON And so as I understand it talking to Nell, you guys were caught in the sort of traditional pattern where you would get upset, you would get sort of angry -- 

00:09:35
STEPHANIE Anxiou -- yeah. 

00:09:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON Anxious -- 

00:09:35
STEPHANIE Anxious is a big part of me. I think that I'm only learning to realize -- 

00:09:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON Okay. So you'd get anxious and then somehow it would translate into you pushing Earl, wanting Earl to come closer. 

00:09:45
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:09:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON But that would backfire and you'd get upset with Earl. And, Earl, as I understand it, you'd sort of feel, um, blamed and you'd move away, right? And the more -- 

00:10:00
EARL Yes. 

00:10:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- you moved away, the more upset you'd get. 

00:10:00
STEPHANIE The more I nagged and the more anxious I got, and the more I went after him, and -- 

00:10:05
EARL Well, I'm -- I'm kind of an introvert anyway. I didn't -- don't talk a lot to begin with. And I think that was also part of the problem. You know, sometimes she would say something, and I'd just -- I didn't see where there -- a response was needed. And that -- 

00:10:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON You wouldn't quite know what to do? You help me, Earl. It's like you -- 

00:10:25
EARL Probably not know -- 

00:10:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- you wouldn't quite know what to do? 

00:10:30
EARL -- not know how to respond to it. 

00:10:30
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. 

00:10:30
EARL You know, and -- and when in doubt, say nothing. You think twice -- 

00:10:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. 

00:10:35
EARL -- and say nothing, you know. 

00:10:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON When in doubt, say nothing. And that's right -- and that's what a lot of us do. And fun -- in a funny way, especially with the people we love, because we don't want to say something wrong, right? 

00:10:45
EARL Yes. 

00:10:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON So -- so you would say, 'Well, I don't know what to do, so I'm going to say nothing.' But that's a tricky -- because then you feel like he's somehow not letting you in, you feel shut out -- 

00:10:55
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:10:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- and you get more upset, yeah. 

00:10:55
STEPHANIE Um-hum. Because I tend to talk a lot, so -- I mean, I don't do that, "think twice, say nothing". I talk and hope to get the right words eventually, you know. So I have a different approach totally. 

00:11:05
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. So you help me. You've been working in EFT and so you've talked to your therapist about this and you've read "Hold Me Tight". So what I want to know is, do you guys feel like you can -- when this -- when you guys start to feel disconnected and this dance just appears, you -- your feet just start doing this dance, right? There's a certain emotional music that plays, and your feet just start doing this dance. Do you feel like you can catch it when it's happening? Can you -- 

00:11:35
EARL We're only -- 

00:11:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON Or maybe it's not at that level yet. You help me. 

00:11:40
EARL I think we're only just now beginning to -- 

00:11:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON Really get it? 

00:11:45
EARL -- be able to slow it down. Um, you know, we just recently read the book, and that shed a lot of light on things. But, uh, typically we need a little bit of cool-off time maybe the next morning or, you know, a space of time before we could repair whatever went wrong in the given circumstance. 

00:12:05
DR. SUE JOHNSON But -- but you help me, Earl. You're saying, 'Sue, it's still new. We're still sort of dealing with it, understanding it, but I think we are starting to have the ability to slow it down'? Is that what you're saying? 

00:12:20
EARL Yes, but, you know, when -- when things are hot and passionate, we -- we really couldn't stop it at that point. We'd need a little bit of time apart and, you know, a chance to think it over what we were -- what we were saying, what we were fighting about, what -- 

00:12:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON And then when you have that time, can you guys come back? 

00:12:35
EARL Uh -- 

00:12:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON Can you come back and reach for each other? 

00:12:40
EARL It -- we're getting better now, uh, about it. 

00:12:40
STEPHANIE Much better. 

00:12:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON You -- you -- 

00:12:40
STEPHANIE Much closer. 

00:12:45
EARL There was a -- there was a point -- 

00:12:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON Stephanie, you agree that -- 

00:12:45
STEPHANIE Yes. 

00:12:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah? 

00:12:45
STEPHANIE I don't think it escalates like he -- that doesn't escalate to the point that it did. We at least now are able to -- we've kind of decided our thing sometimes is not talking about it right then. But it doesn't escalate. We don't walk away totally hating each other. And a little bit later we come back together and, you know, I'm able to say, you know, 'I don't think that was fair,' you know, say some really -- words like that we didn't use before, you know, 'I' -- 

00:13:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON Okay. 

00:13:10
STEPHANIE -- 'You really hurt my feelings' and talk about it We've had a few instances in the last couple weeks even that -- that have been good. 

00:13:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON That's great, guys. That's great. Who comes back? Can you both -- who reaches? Can you both reach, or just some -- one person reach? 

00:13:25
STEPHANIE I think we both have. 

00:13:25
EARL I -- 

00:13:25
STEPHANIE Don't you? 

00:13:25
EARL I think it's shared. I think we're both realizing that we're not the enemy -- 

00:13:35
STEPHANIE I told him I'm -- 

00:13:35
EARL -- that the cycle -- 

00:13:35
STEPHANIE I'm sorry. 

00:13:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON That's a pretty huge -- 

00:13:35
STEPHANIE Sorry. 

00:13:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- thing you just said. Yeah? Because that's what we get caught in, in a distressed relationship: We start to feel the other person's just hurting us because they want to hurt us, right? So -- 

00:13:45
EARL It's kind of silly. I don't know why we didn't see it before. Uh, it just -- it's just starting to come together. It seems like that we're starting to recognize, you know, that each other is not the enemy. 

00:14:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON Uh-huh. That's huge. Yeah? 

00:14:05
STEPHANIE It is. It's like, oh my gosh, all this time. But, you know, we're -- we're who we are, and it's -- 

00:14:15
DR. SUE JOHNSON Well, hey -- 

00:14:15
STEPHANIE It is. 

00:14:15
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- you know, it's like -- the way I think about it is we're just learning how to do these relationships, you know, where lots of us have never seen what a really, really lasting loving bond looks like. 

00:14:25
STEPHANIE That's for sure. 

00:14:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right? 

00:14:25
STEPHANIE Yes. 

00:14:30
DR. SUE JOHNSON I mean, I think, um, maybe that's the reason I'm in this field, because I certainly didn't see it when I watched my parents; they fought like hell. 

00:14:35
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:14:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right? So -- so if we haven't seen it and we're caught in this dance and we have all these strong emotions, why wouldn't we be off-balance and off-course and not understand. Right? And then we just get swept along, right, and it just gets worse and worse. 

00:14:50
STEPHANIE Um-hum. Um-hum. 

00:14:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON  And we feel less and less safe. 

00:14:55
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:14:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON But you guys are changing that now. You're able to see where you get stuck, understand that there's a certain dance happening. And even if you can't stop it in the moment, you can slow it down -- 

00:15:05
STEPHANIE Right. 

00:15:05
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- it's not so bad. And you can come back afterwards and reach for each other, repair it? 

00:15:10
EARL  We're -- we're getting better about that. I wouldn't -- 

00:15:15
DR. SUE JOHNSON That's great, guys. 

00:15:15
EARL I wouldn't say we've arrived yet, because, you know, it just seems like it's just been recently that we've been able to do it. So -- 

00:15:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. 

00:15:25
STEPHANIE I told him on the way down that I still have a -- I'm still not -- it -- it's a weird feeling. I'm not able to embrace it totally, because I still have this fear that it's not going to last or that something's going to happen and we're going to go back down in that horrible cycle. And it's so new -- 

00:15:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON I hear you. 

00:15:45
STEPHANIE -- trying to get -- that -- that it's -- it's, uh, har -- har -- it's kind of like a fleeting happiness that you've -- I feel like it's going to go away again, you know? I can't -- I don't feel comfortable. I still get anxious, but I'm able to talk to myself and -- and we're able to stay calmer, you know. It is -- 

00:16:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON Well, that is a tricky thing about something new that starts to happen that you've longed for for a long time. 

00:16:05
STEPHANIE For a long time. 

00:16:05
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah? That when it first sort of appears, it's hard to trust -- 

00:16:10
STEPHANIE Right. 

00:16:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- that -- 

00:16:15
STEPHANIE Right, the trust. 

00:16:15
DR. SUE JOHNSON It's really come and you can really do it, yeah? 

00:16:15
STEPHANIE Yeah. 

00:16:15
DR. SUE JOHNSON You're always worried that it's going to disappear again. 

00:16:20
STEPHANIE Um-hum. Um-hum. 

00:16:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah? 

00:16:20
STEPHANIE Um-hum. Um-hum. 

00:16:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON I hear you. I hear you. But it sounds like you are doing -- you're -- even though you say, 'I'm naturally an introvert,' and you were in the more distant position in the relationship, like, you're able to come forward and reach, right, and maybe help your wife see that, yeah, you're not going to go back into that cycle, you guys can join together and walk out of that cycle together? 

00:16:50
EARL It's a cooperative venture. You know -- I -- I don't really know how to respond to that. 

00:16:55
STEPHANIE He's being modest. I think he's -- he's really helping me a lot through this. It's -- it's been a flip-flop that I didn't expect. 

00:17:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON Can you tell him that for me? Can you tell him that for me? 

00:17:05
STEPHANIE I think you're being modest. It's been a -- it's been -- it's been amazing. 

00:17:10
EARL Well, and quite honestly, for -- for a while there, I -- I -- I had, shall we say, overdrawn on the emotional bank, you know. I -- I think that we were both, uh, at odds and really didn't see a way out of the forest. And -- and then we got involved with, uh, some help there, and -- and slowly, you know, things began to get better. And -- and now I think we realize that it's -- it's something we're saving and -- and, uh, we're both willing to work toward that. 

00:17:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. And that's one of the strengths of this relationship, that you know you're both willing to work for it, yeah? 

00:17:55
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:17:55
EARL Yeah. 

00:17:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON That you're both committed to this, that you're going to help each other learn how to connect, how to stay connected, how to reach for each other. Yeah? 

00:18:05
STEPHANIE Yeah. 

00:18:05
DR. SUE JOHNSON That's an incredible strength, guys. I mean, that's the main thing that you need here, right? Yeah. So that's great. So I'd like to go back for a second, okay. I'm going to do that sometimes, if that's all right with you. 

00:18:20
STEPHANIE Sure. 

00:18:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON Okay. The first thing you said was you said, 'We are starting to real' -- 'I'm starting to realize that underneath this pattern that we would get caught in' where, you know, you'd move away and shut down and say, 'I don't know what to say, so I’m not going to say anything,' and you'd get more and more anxious, more and more upset. You said, 'I started to realize that really it was like a baby crying.' Yeah? 

00:18:45
EARL Yes. Uh, and the reason that I used that analogy is cuz I -- I just don't -- I know, for one, that I didn't recognize what was going on. Uh, my family background is, you know, we were not a very close family unit. Um, you know, there was not a lot of love and tenderness shown around. And -- and bein cast in the traditional male role, you know, I thought, uh, you gotta be strong, you gotta do everything on y'own, you have to depend on yourself and -- and, you know, I -- when in doubt, I always -- I always just reach back into that -- that mode to -- to kind of set me through. 

00:19:30
DR. SUE JOHNSON Be strong, be silent. 

00:19:30
EARL And that -- 

00:19:30
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. 

00:19:30
EARL -- that -- and -- and looking at the literature, that -- that was absolutely the worse thing that I could have done. But I -- I -- I can almost honestly say that I -- I didn't know that there was a different way to be, not coming from a -- a loving, touching, uh, background. 

00:19:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON I hear you. I hear you that you'd never seen a different way to be with a partner. You never -- 

00:20:00
EARL I've seen people do it but, you know, I -- I don't -- I don't -- well, I don't know if I ever understood it, understood the -- the -- the feelings behind it. 

00:20:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. So you went to the natural place, the place that you knew, right, which was be strong, be silent, just shut down, right? 

00:20:20
EARL Yeah. 

00:20:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON And just sort of don't say -- 

00:20:20
EARL That, or just totally blow up in anger to try to, you know, put the problem at bay, you know. 

00:20:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON  Right. But now you're starting to realize that underneath that, there was a whole other level of feeling, yeah? 

00:20:35
EARL Yes. 

00:20:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON So if you take that, press the elevator button and go down in that elevator into those softer deeper feelings, the image that comes up for you, you -- you help me, Earl. By the way, guys, if I say something, um, that isn't quite right for you and doesn't quite fit for you, I want you to correct me, okay? I want you to say, 'No, Sue, it's not quite like that' -- 

00:20:55
EARL Yeah. 

00:20:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- 'it's more like this,' because I'm going to make mistakes, all right? Okay, and you -- you're the expert on what's going on `with you, okay? 

00:21:05
EARL Sure we are. 

00:21:05
DR. SUE JOHNSON All right. So if you take that elevator down and you go into the -- the softer feelings that you would never let yourself maybe even feel when you were being strong and silent, the image that comes up for you is a baby crying, yeah? 

00:21:20
EARL  Uh, that was just the analogy that I used. I -- I think, you know, in looking at the -- at the literature and listening to the tapes, you know, it was probably a fear of failure, you know, and -- 

00:21:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON Is that right? Fear of -- that's -- 

00:21:40
EARL Not -- not being good enough for the -- 

00:21:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON Not being good enough. 

00:21:45
EARL -- particular relationship, or -- 

00:21:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON  That's a huge one, isn't it? 

00:21:50
EARL Yeah. Yeah. 

00:21:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON That's a hard feeling, yeah, to love somebody and really want to be with them, and somehow not quite know how to do it right -- 

00:22:00
EARL Yes. 

00:22:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- and feel like 'I don't know how to do it, and I'm never going to make it here, I'm never going to be good enough,' yeah. That hurts. 

00:22:10
EARL Intensely powerful. 

00:22:15
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. Can you feel some of that as we're sitting talking about it here? Right? That's a hard feeling, huh? 

00:22:25
EARL And in order to do that, I'd have to overcome my fear of being in front of all these nice people. 

00:22:30
DR. SUE JOHNSON Well, what -- let me put it another way. When I look into your face, I feel like I can see some of that. Right? 

00:22:35
EARL Ah, yeah. 

00:22:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON That you can touch that right now, yeah? 

00:22:40
EARL Yeah. 

00:22:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON And, you know, the other thing about everyone in this room is, if we're really honest, we all know that feeling anyway. Yeah? 

00:22:50
EARL Well, that's one of the things that sort of came out in the literature is that everybody has these feelings and, uh, it seems like some people are either better-equipped or -- or just better at -- at dealing with it, more self-confident, um, you know, whatever the case may be. 

00:23:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON That's right. Everybody has these feelings; they're wired into our brains. That's right. And some of us have had the chance to know how to walk around in them and get to know them more and can use them in a different way, and some of us haven't. Yeah? But we all have these feelings; they're just part of being human. Yeah? So what you're saying to me is you're saying, 'Sue, I'm starting to realize that one of the things that's been going on for me all these years with my lady, perhaps because -- just because she is so precious to me, is that in these dreadful dance -- in this dreadful dance we get in where I would shut down, right, underneath that, it would be -- there would be crying, there would be a feeling of that it would be hurting, right, and part of that would be -- I would feel like I don't know how to do this, I'm just not good enough,' yeah? 

00:24:10
EARL I think so, but I think I reacted with anger, because that's -- that's not a feeling that -- maybe I was incapable of dealing with or I -- I wasn't -- you know, I -- I didn't even recognize it at the time, I don't think. You know, it was, uh, her reaching for emotional attachment, just, uh, you know, sometimes she was chasing and I -- well, I didn't react well, obviously. But I -- I reacted with anger. 

00:24:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON You didn't understand. You didn't understand. 

00:24:45
EARL Yeah, well, to me it was -- it was like an attack, you know. I didn't -- 

00:24:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:24:45
EARL -- I didn't recognize the underpinnings of it, and -- 

00:24:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. 

00:24:50
EARL -- and so, you know, I -- 

00:24:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON You'd somehow -- 

00:24:50
EARL -- I went into self-defense mode. 

00:24:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah. You'd somehow hear her saying, 'Earl, you're doing it wrong.' You know, 'How come you're not this way?' You'd hear her attacking you, right? 

00:25:05
EARL Yes. 

00:25:05
DR. SUE JOHNSON You didn't understand that there was also -- And help me; correct me if I'm wrong here, okay? Um, there was also sort of a desperation; she was pushing because she wanted you to come and -- 

00:25:15
EARL Yeah. 

00:25:15
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- you didn't understand that. You just saw her telling you, 'You're doing this wrong, buddy.' Am I getting it? 

00:25:20
EARL Exactly, yeah. 

00:25:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. And then when you heard the message 'I'm doing it wrong,' you just wouldn't know what to do, so you'd just sort of withdraw, right? 

00:25:30
EARL Right. 

00:25:30
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. But do you -- have you ever actually, um, talked to your lady here about that fear that comes up for you that you're some -- in those moments, that you're somehow not going to know what to do and you're not going to do it right somehow, you're not going to do it in a way that really fits for her, you're not going to be able to respond in the way she needs? Have you ever been able to talk to her about that, Earl? 

00:26:00
EARL I -- I guess we've talked about it a little bit, but not at length. We're just now starting to identify what the real problems are. 

00:26:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON Um-hum. 

00:26:10
STEPHANIE  Last night when you were watching the -- Arwen and Blair; Arwen was -- Blair was talking about his, uh -- 

00:26:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON That's the "Hold Me Tight" -- 

00:26:20
STEPHANIE "Hold Me" -- 

00:26:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- DVD. 

00:26:20
STEPHANIE DVD. 

00:26:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:26:20
STEPHANIE He was -- that the guy -- there was -- Blair's the man, and he was saying how he, uh, um -- he was saying some of the same things Earl's just saying about not being good enough. And then Earl looked over at me and he said, 'I think I -- I'm like that. I think I'm -- you know, I -- I feel like that.' And that was kind of the first time, I mean, blatantly that he's ever really said it like that. And, you know, that was a lot of insight for me for him to say that. 

00:26:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON Is that right? What ha -- can you -- can you -- 

00:26:50
STEPHANIE I mean, this -- 

00:26:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON Can you tell him what happened to you when you heard him say that? What was that like for you to hear him talk about that, huh? 

00:27:00
STEPHANIE Well, I guess then I kind of identified with the -- the woman in the DVD, thinking that isn't what I was trying to convey at all, ever. You know, it was -- you know, I think sort of what -- I think now, after a lot of the insight and -- what I've gotten, I think a lot of it is that I just -- I needed to feel treasured by you, or -- or, um, you know, like I was special to you. And, again, cuz of my upbringing, the dysfunction in that, that I was never really treasured by anybody. And even though we're together, and I know he loves me, and people always say how much he loves me and stuff, I needed to feel special for -- to him. And I think by my nagging and everything, I -- I -- 

00:27:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON That it was all about wanting to feel -- 

00:27:50
STEPHANIE Wanting connection -- or -- or wanting him to -- 

00:27:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON Or wanting to be reassured and to feel that you were precious. 

00:27:55
STEPHANIE Affirm some of the things I -- you know, yes. I think -- I really think that was a lot of what I was doing. 

00:28:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON But -- right. But can I go back for a second here? Because there's something important. So last night when Earl was able to say that to you, right -- 

00:28:10
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:28:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- you - you help me - it was almost like what I heard you say was 'I was' -- you were surprised? Or that was -- that was kind of new for you, it -- 

00:28:20
STEPHANIE It was totally new. I -- yes, it was a surprise -- 

00:28:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. 

00:28:25
STEPHANIE -- that he had felt that he wasn't good enough, because I felt like I've never -- didn't -- that's not what I ever meant to convey. You know, I just wanted him. I mean, he's obviously good enough. We've been married for years, and I wanted to be married and -- I don't know. It was -- it was, uh, surprising. 

00:28:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON Can you hear her? 

00:28:40
EARL Um-hum. 

00:28:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON  What happens to you when she says that? 

00:28:45
EARL It feels -- pride. 

00:28:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON Sorry? 

00:28:50
EARL I feel pride. 

00:28:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON Pride. 

00:28:50
EARL And -- and that's why I used that analogy of the baby crying: We didn't know what we were asking for or how to ask for it. 

00:29:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. Right. That's a beautiful way to put it. I think you just said something really profound. Okay. That's -- that's right. We don't know what we're asking for, and we don't know how to ask, right? But right here, right now, when your lady says this, right, when she says, 'I didn't want you to feel that way. In fact, I wanted to be married to you. That was the whole point,' you feel pride, yeah? Can you tell her? 

00:29:30
EARL Yes. I am -- I am happy, proud that you're my wife -- and that I'm good enough for her. 

00:29:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. It helps you because that's sort of what you need to hear to feel safer in this relationship right now. My sense is that's just what you need, yeah, is to hear that this lady never intended for you to feel that sense of failure, that's not what she wanted, and that what was going on for her was that she really wanted you, yeah, she wanted you. And you -- that helps you a lot, right? That helps you -- 

00:30:10
EARL It -- it does. 

00:30:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON That gives you a sense of pride, yeah? 

00:30:15
EARL But it seemed like it got lost in the translation there -- 

00:30:15
STEPHANIE Oh, yeah. 

00:30:15
EARL -- you know. I mean, we were at odds over different things, and that -- that didn't seem to be an issue at all. 

00:30:20
STEPHANIE Right. 

00:30:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON No. In fact, you were getting the complete other message, right? 

00:30:30
EARL Exactly. 

00:30:30
STEPHANIE And then I don't think he felt safe enough, because of how he felt. I kind of -- I always wanted more interaction, and -- and I don't think he felt maybe even safe enough, because of the way I made him feel, to talk to me about anything or -- or we couldn't have any decent conversations because we were lost in the feelings that we both were wanting and not getting answered. You know? I mean, and it just got worse and worse. 

00:31:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON So you didn't understand that deep inside he was so scared of disappointing you, that's why he was shutting down, right? 

00:31:05
STEPHANIE No, I had no idea. 

00:31:05
DR. SUE JOHNSON And you're telling him right now, 'I don't think you understood' -- 'you underst' -- 'have understood how much I need you to come be with me,' right? 

00:31:15
STEPHANIE Right. Right. 

00:31:15
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah? What's it like to tell him that? This is -- I get the feeling this is all very new. Maybe I shouldn't have -- you guys shouldn't have read "Hold Me Tight" just before this. So what's it like to tell him that right now? 

00:31:35
STEPHANIE Well, it still feels scary. I mean, it feels -- 

00:31:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON  Does it? 

00:31:40
STEPHANIE I have -- I don't know. Still a little part of me feels weak. I mean, I've always had to be pretty strong too. I'm the oldest child of an alcoholic father, and I've -- I've, you know, had to take a lot of responsibility in my life and, you know, not be weak at all. So it's still hard to feel vulnerable. Vulnerability's not easy for me. 

00:32:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON I hear you. I hear you. Hmm? 

00:32:10
STEPHANIE So -- 

00:32:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah, that's a hard -- that's a hard place for you to go. That wasn't -- you didn't learn when you were growing up that that was a safe place to be, yeah, to -- to be -- you didn't learn that it was okay to go into the vulnerability. 

00:32:25
STEPHANIE No. 

00:32:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON It was dangerous for you, was it? In -- in your family when you were growing up -- 

00:32:30
STEPHANIE It just -- 

00:32:30
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- that was a dangerous place -- 

00:32:30
STEPHANIE Well -- 

00:32:30
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- yeah? 

00:32:30
STEPHANIE -- yes, it was. It just -- it wasn't a -- it wasn't even an option. It just really hardly was an option. I mean -- and it's -- still I'm close to my sisters and mom, but vulnerability's not an option. I mean, it's just be strong and don't complain, and keep going, don't ask for help, don't ask for friendship. You know, it's weird. 

00:32:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON Don't ask. 

00:32:50
STEPHANIE Don't ask, you know? 

00:32:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON Don't ask. Right. 

00:32:55
STEPHANIE Don't tell. Don't talk. Don't -- you know. 

00:32:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON Don't tell, don't ask. 

00:32:55
STEPHANIE Don't go to those deeper places, or just considered kind of weak, you know, they really are, in my family, and that's been hard, because I feel like I've needed to get to those deeper places. And -- and, you know, he's -- that's what I -- I -- he's had to take a -- the -- the brunt of a lot, I think, you know, and that's what I've been wanting from him all these years. 

00:33:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. 

00:33:20
STEPHANIE And he didn't know it, I guess, because I didn't know how to go about it. 

00:33:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. But right here, right -- but it sounds like you guys are helping each other here walk into a whole new place where you can take those kind of risks for each other, right? But right here, right now, it's -- it's pretty scary. I'm hearing it's pretty scary for you to talk about these softer feelings and to say to your partner, 'Listen, all these years, really I've been trying to reach for you. Maybe I've been doing it a way that -- in a way that was pushing you away, but I've been trying to reach for you.' That's pretty scary for you to do, right? 

00:33:55
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:33:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON Because some part of your brain says, 'Don't go there. Don't go there. That's weak. That's a dangerous place,' right? 

00:34:05
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:34:05
DR. SUE JOHNSON So that's scary for you, yeah? 

00:34:05
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:34:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON Can you tell him? Can you tell him about what that scary place feels like, that if you open up and you're vulnerable and you tell him what you need -- can you tell him what that feels like to you? What's the worst thing that's going to happen for you there? 

00:34:20
STEPHANIE  That was a good -- it's -- it's -- it's easy -- it's not so hard maybe to tell you and to talk to you what's the hardest thing is that it's going to go away. I'm going to tell you and then you're going to hurt me again, or you're going to start drinking again, or it's going to get -- you know, it's not going to last, or you're going to make fun of me later, or -- or mock me later for -- for going to that place. That -- that might be it: You're going to mock me for going to that place. 

00:34:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON And, now, that was -- I -- that word -- I remember that word when I first asked you guy -- I asked Nell about you guys. That was part of your really negative cycle, wasn't it, that you'd get real angry and that you'd feel that he was somehow mocking you, because he'd kind of dismiss it and make light of it, yeah? 

00:35:10
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:35:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON So that was -- that's a painful place for you in this relationship, yeah? 

00:35:10
STEPHANIE Or he mocks me. Like, he -- he's mocked his mom all -- you know, he mocks his mom in a certain way, and sometimes I feel like he's mocking me that way, but -- 

00:35:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. So -- 

00:35:20
STEPHANIE Right. It is painful. 

00:35:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON So part of you says, 'I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, this feels pretty scary, because' -- you help me if I'm getting this right -- you're telling Earl, 'Because if I really open up and reach and risk with you and show you what I need and what I'm longing for, you could mock me,' right, 'and then I'd feel' - you help me - 'really small and really awful and really shamed somehow.' 

00:35:55
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:35:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON Am I getting it? 

00:35:55
STEPHANIE Um-hum. Um-hum. 

00:35:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON 'You could mock me and dismiss me' -- 

00:36:00
STEPHANIE "Dismiss" is a good word, yes. 

00:36:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON 'You'd dismiss me and then I'd feel even more alone.' Am I getting it here? 

00:36:05
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:36:05
DR. SUE JOHNSON All right. 'Or I'll' -- the first thing I heard was 'I'll reach for you and you'll be there for a second, and then you'll disappear. And I'll feel even more hurt.' Am I getting it? 

00:36:25
STEPHANIE Um-hum. Um-hum. 

00:36:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON Is this -- 

00:36:25
STEPHANIE Um-hum. So -- so do I -- 

00:36:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON I'm taking some leaps here. 

00:36:25
STEPHANIE -- do I really go there? Right. So do I really go there, or not? You know, or do I just take the safe route? 

00:36:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON Which is sort of to stand back and just sort of -- 

00:36:40
STEPHANIE Just go there a little bit, maybe talk a little bit, maybe not go maybe as deep as I could or should or -- 

00:36:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON So what you're saying to him is, 'It's really hard -- it's really scary for me. I'm -- I feel like I could be hurt so badly here to open up'? That's what you're telling him? 

00:36:50
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:36:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON Can you tell him right here right now? 

00:36:55
STEPHANIE Well, you know, it's just I -- I think that's kind of where I've gotten in -- in our -- in my withdrawing lately too is just that I can't stand the getting together and then feeling so, so good and then the letdown of it every time seems to get worse and worse. So -- so I stay at a certain emotional distance and -- and that feels safer, you know. It's not necessarily where I'd want to be, but -- 

00:37:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON 'Cuz it's so hard for me to feel the scariness of reaching for you.' 

00:37:30
STEPHANIE Right. 

00:37:30
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah? 

00:37:30
STEPHANIE Right, because I -- I don't think I could take too much more letdown now. I don't think I can -- 

00:37:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON 'I'm so scared you're going to let me down,' yeah? 

00:37:40
STEPHANIE And I'm afraid, if he did, I would have to do -- I couldn't stand it anymore. I mean, I'm just -- I'm just -- 

00:37:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON 'I'm so scared you're going to let me down, I couldn't stand that. For me to let myself feel this longing and then for you to let me down, I couldn't stand that,' yeah? 

00:37:55
STEPHANIE I -- I don't think -- 

00:37:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON It's what you're telling him? 

00:37:55
STEPHANIE Right. I mean, I think I couldn't be in the marriage anymore, to tell -- I just -- 

00:38:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON 'I can't' -- 'I couldn't be hurt like that.' 

00:38:00
STEPHANIE I can't be hurt -- no, I can -- so that's why -- no, I can't. I don't think I could stand it. 

00:38:05
DR. SUE JOHNSON I hear you. I hear you. What happens for you, oh, when you hear your lady say this? 

00:38:15
EARL Uh, that's -- that's difficult. Um, I think, uh -- I -- I think I acted badly -- 

00:38:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON Can you tell -- 

00:38:25
EARL -- when we were -- when we were in our very worst state, you know, what would be the first of the Demon Dialogues. 

00:38:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON When you were attacking each other all -- 

00:38:35
EARL Yeah. 

00:38:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:38:40
EARL And, uh, I -- I think that's -- in reflecting back on it, I think I was trying to push her away as quickly as I could, you know, just to, you know, to -- to bring peace to the -- 

00:38:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:38:55
EARL -- the -- the situation of the moment, which, you know, obviously did no good at all. 

00:39:05
DR. SUE JOHNSON So you're saying to your lady - you help me - when she says this to you, you feel what? You feel sad, or you -- that she's saying this -- or you -- you feel regret? You say to yourself, 'I' -- 'Gee, I -- maybe she's got the right to be scared, because I acted badly'? Is that how it goes? 

00:39:20
EARL Well, yes, I -- I think she's got the right to feel that way because I did act badly and I do from time to time, and, you know, I think we both do. Um, you know, it's -- it's, uh, distressing to me to think that it could be over, you know, that -- that she's reached the point where she can't take it anymore -- or you can't take it anymore. You know, that's certainly not what I want. 

00:39:50
STEPHANIE It's what I want either. 

00:39:50
EARL You know -- 

00:39:50
STEPHANIE That's why it hurts so bad. 

00:39:50
EARL Well, we've -- we've come a long way. The -- and -- and, you know, I know that the last couple difficulties that we've had have been the extreme, it seems like. And I'm not sure why they've -- 

00:40:05
STEPHANIE Right. 

00:40:05
EARL -- regressed to that point. You know -- 

00:40:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON You're saying to your lady, 'I hear you and it makes me feel bad and full of regret that you would be scared like this. And it's scary for me to think that you would ever just decide that you couldn't be hurt and you'd walk away'? That's what you're telling her? 

00:40:25
EARL Yes. 

00:40:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON You don't want her to do that? You're telling her, 'I don't want you to walk away'? 

00:40:30
EARL Absolutely not. 

00:40:30
DR. SUE JOHNSON 'We have got stuck in the past, but I understand you're scared. You have reason to be scared, but I don't want you to walk away'? That's what you're telling her? 

00:40:40
EARL Yes. 

00:40:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON I want you to tell her -- 

00:40:40
EARL We have a huge investment of -- 

00:40:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON Can you tell her that -- 

00:40:40
EARL -- of time. 

00:40:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- directly? 

00:40:45
EARL I'm -- I'm fixing to do that. We have a huge investment in time and energy, and, you know, a -- a lot of good times behind us and in front of us. 

00:41:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:41:00
EARL And I -- and I'd -- you know, I -- I don't think that any little trouble there is insurmountable. And I'm -- I'm frankly a little surprised that, you know, it would be as -- as cut-and-dried as, you know, almost to -- it almost sounds like an ultimatum. 

00:41:20
STEPHANIE It's not that cut-and-dried. I don't mean it like that at all. I just mean that -- 

00:41:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON You were just trying to help him understand how scary it is -- 

00:41:25
STEPHANIE How -- 

00:41:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- for you. 

00:41:25
STEPHANIE Right, how hurtful it's -- hurt -- hurtful it is, because I know we could -- it's -- I know it could be better, and I'm just -- I just -- I know I can't go on the way we were, so I can't have any -- 

00:41:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right. 

00:41:35
STEPHANIE We can't do that. And I don't think you can either. So I'm just saying it's just to show you how hurtful it is. I'm not saying you're going to do something wrong and I'm going to leave because it's not just right. 

00:41:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON You -- yeah. Yeah, you're trying to -- you're -- what I think was happening is you're trying to get him to understand how scary it is for you to open up and risk and tell him about what you're longing for and need, because you're scared of being hurt again, and then you remember that you can't be hurt like that again. That's what you're trying to tell him? 

00:42:05
STEPHANIE That's -- that's exactly -- 

00:42:05
DR. SUE JOHNSON Okay. 

00:42:05
STEPHANIE That's it. It's that. 

00:42:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON So -- so the key part of that message, for me, is really you're trying to say that part of the struggle for you right here, right now, in this relationship is to start to open up and risk and talk to your husband about what you need, and that that's scary for you, right? That's -- 

00:42:30
STEPHANIE Very scary. 

00:42:30
DR. SUE JOHNSON Can you tell him -- 

00:42:30
STEPHANIE Very scary. 

00:42:30
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- a little bit of what that fear feels like right now, right here? What does it feel like when you talk about it, Stephanie? What does that feel like? 

00:42:40
STEPHANIE  I don't know. It -- maybe it goes back to the weakness thing. I mean, you even said the other night you -- you -- you said you had -- you didn't realize all along in our marriage that -- what I needed, because you thought I was stronger than that. And -- 

00:43:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON Hmm. 

00:43:00
STEPHANIE And -- and I -- I -- I want you to understand that just because I want you to be closer to me in all the other ways, career, what -- kids, everything else, I'm still strong. But, you know, those -- you know, I'm -- I don't want you to -- 

00:43:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON 'I don't want you to think' -- 

00:43:25
STEPHANIE I lost -- 

00:43:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- 'less of me.' 

00:43:25
STEPHANIE I don't want you to think -- yeah. 

00:43:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON 'I don't want' -- it's okay, you can get lost on here, okay. 'I don't want you to think less of me, you know. And I am a strong person. And it's scary for me to tell you about the part of me that's tender' -- 

00:43:40
STEPHANIE Right. 

00:43:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- 'and that longs for you and that has this longing. And I'm so scared to put this out to you, because I'm scared you won't hear it, you won't be there, and then I'll feel even more alone'? 

00:43:55
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:43:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON 'And somehow the only I've survived is to be strong. This feels like I'm -- I'm somehow letting myself be vulnerable in a whole new way,' yeah? 

00:44:05
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:44:05
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah? 

00:44:05
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:44:05
DR. SUE JOHNSON That takes a lot of courage to do that -- 

00:44:05
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:44:05
DR. SUE JOHNSON -- doesn't it? 

00:44:10
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:44:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON Doesn't it? 

00:44:10
STEPHANIE It's harder than I would have ever thought. 

00:44:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON You better believe, especially if, you know, you never experienced in your family that that was an okay thing and that when you were vulnerable like that, people would tune into it and come and help you with it. That's a real -- takes a lot of courage -- lot of strength, actually, to be able to talk about that vulnerability, right? 

00:44:35
STEPHANIE Um-hum. Um-hum. 

00:44:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON But you are doing it right here, right now, yeah? 

00:44:40
STEPHANIE Um-hum. In front of a bunch of people, so I think we're -- we're on -- we're on -- we're on our way. 

00:44:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON Oh, yes, all those guys out there. That's right. I keep forgetting about those guys. 

00:44:45
STEPHANIE You forgot about -- 

00:44:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah. Okay. So you're tell -- you're -- you're saying to your husband something incredibly powerful; you're saying to your husband, 'I see now the possibility that I could, instead of pushing, you know, and sort of moving you around, trying to get you to respond to me in the way I needed, that I could reach for you. But -- but that's pretty scary, because then I have to show you my heart, I have to show you the softer part of me,' right? And that -- that's -- that somehow that feels -- some part of me says maybe that's weak and that you won't see it and you won't respond.' Right? 'You might even -- you'll -- you'll hurt me more. That's scary.' Yeah. 

00:45:30
STEPHANIE I mean, that's -- that's a deeper part. I mean, on the surface I, like -- I feel like he's -- he's not going to do that. I mean, my -- 

00:45:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON I hear you. 

00:45:40
STEPHANIE I want to say that, but it's just I get -- it's almost a part -- 

00:45:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON I hear you. 

00:45:40
STEPHANIE -- a subconscious part of me that -- that -- that -- 

00:45:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON I hear you. 

00:45:45
STEPHANIE -- you know? 

00:45:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah, in your -- in your head you say, 'Oh, he'll be there. Everything'll be fine.' 

00:45:50
STEPHANIE Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

00:45:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON We're talking about this more emotional part. 

00:45:50
STEPHANIE I know, I know, and that's -- 

00:45:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON Can you hear that she's scared? Can you hear -- 

00:45:55
EARL And I didn't realize that, you know. 

00:45:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON What happens to you when she says, 'I'm scared of opening up and risking and trusting and --' what happ -- what happens to you when she says she's scared right here, right now? 

00:46:05
EARL Well, I feel a little guilty about that. I mean, she shouldn't feel that way, now, should she? Should you? I mean, you know, I -- I -- so that means I've done a poor job of making her feel comfortable -- 

00:46:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON Oh. 

00:46:20
EARL -- somehow, someway. 

00:46:25
DR. SUE JOHNSON Okay, you help me. Um, so part of you goes into feeling guilt, like 'Oh my goodness, that's my fault she feels that way,' right? Is there any other feeling that you feel when she says that to you? I want you to talk about that with Nell, that thing you just said, that when she says, 'I'm scared to risk and trust you,' you somehow feel bad, that it's your fault, right? But it's scary for us all to risk, yeah? 

00:46:50
EARL Yes. 

00:46:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON Okay. So I'm going to go back to the baby crying. If you saw your lady as a baby crying, for a moment, reaching out for you, yeah, and saying, 'I'm scared to reach. I'm scared that you'll turn away,' what would you feel in that moment? 

00:47:10
EARL Tenderness. I, uh -- 

00:47:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:47:10
EARL You know, I -- I -- I've got to be there to come to the emotional rescue. 

00:47:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON Hey. Earl, that's a lovely thing you said. Right. You're saying, 'I think maybe what I feel is tenderness and maybe, even though some part of me goes into guilt, I actually feel like you're asking me to come to your emotional rescue,' yeah? And that's something you'd like to be able to do? Yeah? 

00:47:50
EARL Yes. 

00:47:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON Can you tell your lady that right now? 

00:47:55
EARL You know, I -- I'm sorry I didn't -- I missed all the signs, that I -- I -- you know, I didn't see it. I should have been able to read through the lines and then figure out that, you know -- 

00:48:05
STEPHANIE  Well, you can't undo my past and everything else, so -- you just -- 

00:48:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON 'And I'd like to be able to?' 

00:48:15
EARL I'd like to be, you know, the rock that you stand on. You know, I mean, it's -- seeing some of the -- the printed material over the past week has kind of opened my eyes to the fact that, you know, that -- that there was an undercurrent going on that I didn't -- didn't see I was -- I was not attuned to at all. And, you know, I -- I should have done a better job of ferreting that out and -- and, uh -- 

00:48:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON 'And I'd like to be the rock that you stand on,' right? 'I'd like to come to your emotional rescue, and I'd like to be the rock you stand on.' Is that what you're telling your lady? 

00:49:00
EARL Absolutely. 

00:49:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON  Can you hear him? 

00:49:05
STEPHANIE Um-hum. I heard him. 

00:49:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON Can you take that -- 

00:49:10
STEPHANIE I can take it in, mostly. 

00:49:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON Can you take it in? 

00:49:10
STEPHANIE Mostly. 

00:49:15
DR. SUE JOHNSON Okay, you help me. Tell me the bit -- tell me where the -- tell me where it's hard to take in. Is there a place where it's hard to take in? 

00:49:25
STEPHANIE No, I hear him, I do. I take it in. I -- I -- I believe him. I believe him, I do. 

00:49:30
DR. SUE JOHNSON Um-hum. If you guys can do this, what you've done on this stage with me, if you guys can do this, you're doing fine, okay, you're doing fine. I see it. 

00:49:45
EARL Well the -- the crisis will -- the next crisis will determine that, won't it? 

00:49:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON You know what, there's always going to be crises. We never go where we're connected and, once we're connected, everything's smooth. Right? Never. We always go connection-disconnection-connection-disconnection. But what the story you guys are telling me is that you're starting to understand what the disconnection's all about and, when you're disconnected, you don't see each other as the enemy. And you're starting to be able to come back and reach, and you're -- if you can do what you just did up here on the stage with me, then you guys can create a safer and safer way of dancing where you can hold each other and help each -- you can help him with his feeling of maybe not being good enough, when he gets scared, so he doesn't have to shut down, and he can help you with your need to feel precious and important to him. Yeah? 

00:50:45
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:50:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON Right? 

00:50:45
STEPHANIE Um-hum. 

00:50:45
DR. SUE JOHNSON  And you can feel more and more secure with coming and -- and reaching for him. 

00:50:55
STEPHANIE Um-hum. Um-hum. 

00:50:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON If you guys can do that, hey, you're going to be just fine, you're going to be just fine, okay? All right, so we're going to change pace here, all right? You're all right? 

00:51:10
EARL Oh, yeah. 

00:51:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON Earl, are you okay? 

00:51:10
EARL Yes. 

00:51:10
DR. SUE JOHNSON Yeah? Okay. So we're going to change pace here and I'm going to turn back to these guys here, okay? 

00:51:20
STEPHANIE Thank you. 

00:51:20
DR. SUE JOHNSON  You're welcome. So -- 

00:51:30
[sil.] 

00:51:30
DR. SUE JOHNSON  From my point of view here, um, what you just saw was a very courageous open couple who've obviously had some very good EFT, because for them to come up here and take these risks for me -- with me, okay -- this isn't totally new for them. But from my point of view, what I went -- what I did was I went in and I talked about the negative cycle and I found out whether they had a secure base, which would be the end of stage one of EFT, so that they could start to turn and take real risks with each other. Once I found out yes I think they've got enough of a secure base to do that, I then went in and I started with Earl; I start with the -- the person who usually takes the withdrawn position in the relationship. And Earl came out and he was able to talk about his underlying vulnerability and talk about it very openly, right? And so then I went to his lady and I invited Stephanie to take a risk, and I stayed with the block that she felt about taking the risk. And I asked each of them to take risks and process the other person being able to respond, and they were able to do that. And if they hadn't been able to respond to each other, I would have stayed there and worked with that. But I hope you can see here how what we do in EFT is -- second stage of EFT is all about gradually building the couple's comfort and competence in being able to reach for each other and risk and create more and more safety, and more and more trust, and more and more connection, because what I want at the end of EFT is a more secure bond for the couple, because what we know from the literature is that lasts. If you have a more secure bond, you're creating significant change for the couple; not only that, but we know that more secure bonds translates into better mental and physical health, more personal resilience, more personal strength for each person in the couple. Thank you so much.
