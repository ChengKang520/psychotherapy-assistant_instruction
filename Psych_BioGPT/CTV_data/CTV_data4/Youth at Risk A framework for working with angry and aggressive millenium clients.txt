Youth at Risk: A framework for working with angry and aggressive millennium clients 

00:00:05
THOM PANCELLA Hello, and welcome to this MIMHTraining.com presentation called "Youth at Risk: A framework for working with angry and aggressive millennium clients." My name is Thom Pancella with the Missouri Institute of Mental Health. Thank you for taking the time to take this training program. We're joined today by Dacia Moore. 

00:00:20
DACIA MOORE Yes. 

00:00:20
THOM PANCELLA And she is president and founder of Second Wind Counseling and Consulting. She's a Licensed Professional Counselor, author, trainer and motivational speaker.

Dacia has had the honor of studying Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy under Albert Ellis, Dr. Albert Ellis. 

00:01:05
DACIA MOORE Uh-hmm. 

00:01:05
THOM PANCELLA And she holds an advanced REBT certification from the Albert Ellis Institute. She's also recently released a book, "Why Are So Many Students So Angry?" 

00:01:15
DACIA MOORE Yes. 

00:01:15
THOM PANCELLA And Dacia, thanks for joining us. 

00:01:15
DACIA MOORE Well, thank you, Thom, for having me. 

00:01:20
THOM PANCELLA Let's get started with the, with the book since we just introduced that topic. What's the inspiration behind the book, "Why Are So Many Students So Angry?" 

00:01:25
Dacia L. Moore, MA, LPC, NCC 

00:01:25
DACIA MOORE Thom, that was a question that I got from a lot of educators and from a lot of parents. "Students have changed," is a refrain that I would often hear from both of those groups. And they would ask me, "Dacia, why are so many students so angry? Why is my child so angry?" And I have some thoughts around that in terms of how things have changed, but also how things have stayed the same. It's really not that unusual in terms of children being angry especially in, ah, middle, uhm, adolescence to late adolescence. But what we see is a difference in generational issues. And so the book talks about those particular reasons as well as what we can do about them. Because that's what people are wanting, uhm, strategies on how to help my child just navigate this very difficult time, how to help my students so that they stay in class. And that was the other inspiration, Thom, is I would go to the different schools, I do training, and, with the teachers, and students would be in ISS for weeks a-- at a time. One student that I have, ah, just been referred-- or who has just been referred to me, he has a 180 days out-of-school, that's a whole school year. So I'm very concerned about our young people. And to help our young people, I figured that it would be better for me to help the adults to understand the young people so that they could be, ah, maybe more tolerant, more understanding and have strategies to deal with the new student that's in the school today. 

00:02:55
THOM PANCELLA I'd like to get into all of that in this conversation, this is good. 

00:03:00
DACIA MOORE Okay. 

00:03:00
THOM PANCELLA So let's start with that. You said you have some thoughts around why they are angry. 

00:03:05
DACIA MOORE Yes. 

00:03:05
THOM PANCELLA What are you, what are you finding out? Why are people-- why are the students so angry? 

00:03:10
DACIA MOORE It is a complex issue, and it's not just students, you-- we have a lot of angry adults now. As a matter of fact, it's not uncommon when I talk to educators for them to complain about the parents coming in and being very aggressive with them. So it's a societal issue. So in the, in the book, the first few chapters talks about the generational evolution, how parenting has changed, the decline in positional authority where there's not as much respect for a person who is older or for a person who holds a certain title. It's not uncommon for a student to come in my office or who is referred and say, "Well, my teacher didn't respect me so why should I respect her?" In my day, I'm a baby boomer, in my day that just was unheard of. There was positional authority, positional power, that has declined significantly. Parenting has changed. We have more parents who want to be friends or equals with their children than have that parental role. As a matter of fact, 76% of parents say that they are having a more difficult time now training their children than they believe their parents did. So parents are inundated with lots of, ah, different distractions, but they also have the opinion of, "I need to listen to my child, I don't want to do anything that will harm them." I was thinking about an example last night. If I told my mother that I was bored, she would tell me, "Well, you just need to find something to do," or, "You can go in and clean those dishes." Today, if a child says to their parent, "I'm bored," the parent is doing mental gymnastics to find out what can I do to help my child be less bored. "Maybe I'll buy a Wii, maybe I'll enroll him in soccer classes." Maybe I-- they are trying to, uhm, entertain their child versus being the parent and just say, "You know what, you need to get over this." I find that more and more. So that's the generational influence. And then we cannot ignore the influence of technology. These students, these children today, this generation is attached to their technology at the hip. And so they are always on the phone, they are always at, ah, at the video, uhm, consoles. Constant stimulation. Not using a lot of i-- imagination, not using problem solving skills, and, uhm, those reasons are why I think a lot of students are very angry. I think we have lost, uhm, a lot of civility in terms of how to disagree with somebody and still respect them. So I could go on and on because there it's a, it's a very complex issue, but all of those things converge to what I call the perfect storm. And you have parents who are their child's friend, you lost a positional power, influence of technology, ah, change in parenting, all of those things, in addition to other things like community violence. We see more violence on TV, in the video games, and, uhm, in the neighborhoods, unfortunately, particularly in the urban neighborhoods, it is not unusual for-- uhm, as a matter of fact, I was at a, a training the other day, 100% of the students that were in that class had either experienced a death, a violent death by somebody in their family or, ah, knew of somebody who had gotten shot. So we, we have a more violent society and that has caused a lot of students to be angrier. 

00:06:55
THOM PANCELLA You're testing a number of things that, that, that there are-- we can go to a lot of intellectuals with this, great. 

00:06:55
DACIA MOORE That's a bloody information, I know. 

00:07:00
THOM PANCELLA When you talked about the, the, the parents, ah, wanting to solve the problems for their children - 

00:07:05
DACIA MOORE Yeah. Yes. 

00:07:05
THOM PANCELLA - and, and, and, and taking away some of the problem solving skills, does that also lead to a sense of entitlement on behalf of the kids that, that they don't have to do things for themselves? Because I, I, I think of, of children that I know that simply won't go-- do clean the dishes because that's not something they're interested in doing. 

00:07:20
DACIA MOORE Right. 

00:07:25
THOM PANCELLA Uhm, and then also you talked about, ah, the urban and rural differences. Are there differences in urban versus rural settings that you talked-- that, that you're saying? 

00:07:30
DACIA MOORE You know what, they have very parallel problems in the urban and the rural setting, probably more so, ah, they're more like then the suburban. When I do training in the rural areas or when I, ah, conference with those--ah, with folks who live in Southern Missouri, I do a lot of work down in Camdenton, they struggle with methamphetamine, poverty, extreme poverty, alcoholism, and so their problems, ah, ah, look a little bit different, but there still is the domestic violence issue, there still is the community violence issue. In the urban core, we see that more on TV because in the cities that's where the reporters are and that's where there-- that-- that's the, the headline news, that's the, you know, excitement. But I do find that rural and urban children have very similar issues and they are both very angry. Maybe a little bit less than the suburban, but even the suburban child has that same entitlement attitude that you spoke of. That is a generational issue, I believe, is that, uhm, I am entitled to speak to you the way that you speak to me, it doesn't matter that you're 30 years older, uhm, I'm en-- not you. 

00:08:45
THOM PANCELLA How would you know? 

00:08:45
DACIA MOORE Me. Ah, I'm entitled to be entertained. And then you have parents who buy into that. For example, if a child comes home and said, "My teacher, ah, treated me unfairly and called me out of my name," and, ah, you know, whatever else, the parent will go to the school and accuse the teacher many times, taking the side of the child instead of going to the school and having a conversation adult to adult exactly, you know, what happened, what did my child do that may have spurned you to respond that way. In my day, the parent and the teacher were aligned and the child was over here. Now, we have the parent and the child aligned and the teacher or the educator is the outsider. So they are being assaulted many times by the parent and by the child with the parent taking the word that the-- what the child is saying is true. And you have children, you know that's not always the case. 

00:09:50
THOM PANCELLA That's right. And I wonder if that affects how, how teachers then respond to parents who do have significant concerns about what's going on in the classroom. 

00:09:55
DACIA MOORE Yes. 

00:09:55
THOM PANCELLA Because then when those conversations are attempted to take place then the, the, the teacher becomes defensive right away because here she's already been attacked a number of times under the directions. So it makes those conversations a little difficult. Uhm... 

00:10:10
DACIA MOORE I wanna touch on one thing that is related to that, which is the teachers are under extreme pressure for-- from no child left behind, from high stakes testing, and so they are under a lot of anxiety already. And so when you have this situation where the parent comes in and maybe just ask the question, yes, the teacher is a little bit defensive which then in turn adds that defensiveness to the whole interaction. So again, it's a complex issue, I don't wanna just sound like I'm blaming a parent, I'm a parent myself, I had struggles with my own children, but I do find it's more common these days for parents to take the side of the child and then for the teacher to be a little bit defensive because they have all of this background stuff going on and they just want to do their job, they don't wanna get fired, they wanna teach, and many times they are unable to teach because of the behaviors in the classroom. 

00:11:00
THOM PANCELLA Anything that you mentioned that, that was interesting was you talked about the technology kind of getting in the way. 

00:11:05
DACIA MOORE Uh-hmm. 

00:11:05
THOM PANCELLA And yet we refer to these, these, these massive communication devices that we have, we've got all the phones and the texting and the email and whatever else, but I wonder if we've lost the ability to talk to each other. 

00:11:15
DACIA MOORE Well, I think, I think we have, Thom, in, in many respects. We have lost that intimate communication where I'm looking you eyeball to eyeball and we're having a discussion and we have differences of opinion and we can still communicate, we can still talk, we can still be on one accord. And I think we do miss that cuz now kids are talking in sound bites. And they don't have to problem solve. They could just turn their phone off if there, if there are something they don't wanna say. And then if they get angry, they say things that they really shouldn't say, uhm, that shouldn't be read or heard and, and then that turns into a whole mess many times. 

00:11:50
THOM PANCELLA So you do work with schools, parents, kids? 

00:11:55
DACIA MOORE Yes. 

00:11:55
THOM PANCELLA All, all of the above? 

00:11:55
secondwindcc.com 

00:11:55
DACIA MOORE All of the above. In Second Wind Counseling and Consulting, that's my private practice, the, the counseling of course I work with families and, ah, on anger issues, depression, and mental health issues. And then the consulting is why I work with the schools. 

00:12:10
THOM PANCELLA And then we bring in the audience of a lot of mental health professionals. 

00:12:15
DACIA MOORE Right. 

00:12:15
THOM PANCELLA Front line mental health professionals. 

00:12:15
DACIA MOORE Yes. 

00:12:15
THOM PANCELLA So let's, let's take this, this kind of groups a little one at a time here. 

00:12:20
DACIA MOORE Uh-hmm. 

00:12:20
THOM PANCELLA And, and give us some ideas for each of these groups, and I'll let you pick, we've got four groups on the table now. We've got kids, we've got parents, we've got school personnel, and we've got mental health professionals. 

00:12:30
DACIA MOORE Well, let's talk about mental health professionals because those-- ah, I love, uhm, presenting to, ah, counselors, me-- other mental health professionals because I find that they, uhm, they don't know a lot about REBT, rational emotive behavior therapy, that is the, the, ah, behavior therapy that I am most familiar with that I consider myself competent in, always getting better. And I, I would love to share with them some strategies that I think would be helpful. So... 

00:12:55
THOM PANCELLA Let's do it. 

00:13:00
DACIA MOORE All right. Well, REBT, a rational emotive behavior therapy is a cognitive behavior therapy. There had been a number of studies by SAMS and other groups that show the efficacy of REBT in reducing depression, in reducing anger, in reducing a lot of different mental health, ah, issues. REBT, the basis of it is that we have irra-- irrational thoughts, things that we believe that are not true all of us have them. And what we try to do with this modality is to share with people a different perspective, help them to illuminate or to recognize their irrational thinking and then to, uhm, dispute it. And what I found with the clinicians, Thom, is that there are two main areas that they really need to get better at. And when I supervise people, when I do my training, this seemed to be the, the major struggles. Number one is finding the right court issue. And then number two is disputing that court issue. So, uhm, with mental health professionals, I just would encourage them to get as much training in REBT as, as they can. Ah, many times after they finish their masters or PhD program, they get to continuing it because we have to, but not necessarily go deep in one particular modality, and that's, that's very key in working with anger, uhm, and aggressive clients or clients with depression or other mental health issues. 

00:14:25
THOM PANCELLA All right. What about, uhm, school personnel? 

00:14:30
DACIA MOORE School personnel is why I wrote this book because they get a lot of training on curriculum and, uhm, and, and, ah, academic kinds of, ah, ah, work, not so much on how to manage behavior, very few courses on classroom management and even fewer on self-management which is key in working with angry and aggressive students wa-- long in a study he did in 2006 reported that in 100% of the crisis that his team observed they were-- 100% of them were started by students. But in 60%, the adult, the teacher escalated the situation. Teachers, educators, my educator friends, my school counselor friends are human, and when they are faced with the angry and aggressive student who is in their face, ah, probably talking bad about them, the natural response is what, Thom? 

00:15:30
THOM PANCELLA Is to fight back? 

00:15:30
DACIA MOORE That's right. Ah, fight or flight kicks in and where the adult, where the teacher, where the-- this is my classroom, and so they go in with punches. That's not so good for oppositional defiant students or for students who have angry and aggressive tendencies because their tendency then is to, what, fight back. And so you have this escalation that causes, uhm, a lot of hard feelings that takes away from academic time. So that's why I wrote this book, is to give RBET and reality therapy strategies to educators to help them manage themselves so they can recover more quickly from an angry aggressive event and get back to teaching. 

00:16:15
THOM PANCELLA Can you give us an example? 

00:16:20
DACIA MOORE An example of... 

00:16:20
THOM PANCELLA Of a strategy that to help handle the crisis situation? 

00:16:20
DACIA MOORE Well, this is one perfect example, may I show that to you. 

00:16:25
THOM PANCELLA Of course. 

00:16:25
DACIA MOORE It's... 

00:16:25
THOM PANCELLA I was gonna ask you about that. 

00:16:30
DACIA MOORE Isn't that a wonderful picture? It's, uhm, I don't know if we can show that to the audience. 

00:16:35
THOM PANCELLA We can show this to the camera up here. 

00:16:35
DACIA MOORE Ah, uh-huh. That's a wonderful picture of a surfer in Hawaii. And let's just visualize for a minute being in Hawaii on this board surfing. Ah, that just brings our anxiety down immediately. So I do a visualization with this. But also, I have an acronym called Ride the BLUE WAVE. And what I try to share with-- and this is a whole day session on How to Ride the BLUE WAVE. But in essence, or in summary, what I'm trying to help our teachers, our educator friends do, and students as well is, you are the surfer on this wave. Emotions are like a wave that come over you. If you don't stay steady on your board, you're gonna wipe out. So I give them strategies to stay steady on that surfboard and just allow that emotion to come over and you ride with it. It also is an acronym. Ride the BLUE WAVE stands for Believe, Love, Understand, and Expect angry aggressive behavior from your students. Let's be proactive. Many of your students are going to give you guff, are going to be oppositional even if they don't have that diagnosis. There-- I mean, that's just what they do. So have some strategies in your toolbox to, ah, be able to deal with that when it presents itself, and don't be caught off guard. Many educators want to teach, and then when somebody is a little froggy in the classroom or gives them a little bit of opposition, they get thrown off their board. So the strategies that I teach them are to stay on your board, believe, love, understand, and expect. And then the WAVE stands for Wait before you respond, Act accordingly, Visualize victory, and Encourage and be enthusiastic and envision your special place. The key to managing conflict, and I've taught conflict resolution courses, and of course that's what I do with some students in my anger management groups, the key to managing conflict is to manage yourself. That's the key. So if I could help more educators improve in their self-management, help them stay on the board. If I could help more students improve their self-management, help them stay on the board, then all of us get better. So that's one strategy that I use with the educators. 

00:19:05
THOM PANCELLA Let's, ah, move to the student population. 

00:19:05
DACIA MOORE Oh, the students. Well, I use this with the students, they love the visualization. But the, the question that I ask students, and, and I love working with teenagers, I hated being a teenager, so I, I empathize with a lot of their, their angst and their struggle. I try to get-- I use REBT and reality therapy with, with my teenagers and I say to them, just because you are angry does not mean that you have to say anything. You can be quiet. Many teenagers think-- beli-- they believe that they have to say everything that's on their mind. And that's not true. You will not explode. You will not explode if you'd be quiet. So helping them come up with a plan, ah, and this is the reality therapy part of it, what do you want? I want to graduate, I want to become a doctor, I wanna stay in school, I want to get through this class. Then what are you doing to get what you want? And the difference between what you want and what you're doing is an, an intervention in itself. And then we come up with the evaluation of what you're doing and then we develop a plan. And the plan is in baby steps. If you're learning to surf, are you going to stay on your board the first time? The second time? The third time? No, no, you're gonna wipe out. You're gonna wipe out. So that, that helps them to understand baby steps and the expectation that I am practicing this new behavior and I cannot expect myself to be perfect for the rest of the school year. We're gonna talk about the rest of the day or the rest of week. So with students, uhm, using reality therapy and REBT for me is very successful, they get it, and it's liberating because if they understand that they can manage their thinking, they don't have to say everything that is on their mind and they can manage their emotions. Ah, most people, Thom, live by their emotions. And as adults, we do many things that we don't want to do. Teenagers are just learning how to do that. So giving them this acronym, giving them this visualization will help them mature and help them make better decisions. So that's just one of the things that I do with the teenagers I work with. 

00:21:35
THOM PANCELLA And before we get into the parents, do you find yourself working with students and teachers from the same classroom, that kind of the same incident overlapping in, in, in what, in what you're working with? 

00:21:45
DACIA MOORE It can be because there could be a poor negative relationship between those two. So it's not uncommon for student to come in to me and say, "Well, Ms. D, this person, this teacher has a doubt for me," that may be true, that may be true. Ah, but whose behavior can you control? That gets to the reality therapy part of it, that's a great question to ask students over and over and your child. Whose behavior can you control? Your own. You can't control that person. So let's be strategic in how we navigate this situation so that you're more successful. When we-- when I talk with parents and, ah, children, many times children don't want to do the dishes. That is a common challenge with many children. But when you don't do the dishes, what's-- what happens? Again, what you want is a peaceful environment, you wanna get along with your mother, you want a cellphone, you want allowance, you wanna go to the movies, but you're doing things that show the opposite. So let's come up with the plan if even if you don't want to. Let's come up with a plan on how to make you more successful. And that's how I work with children in the homes. And with parents, parents many times are wishy-washy and so I help parents to be fair, firm, and consistent. How to be consistent in their communication with their child, with their discipline, and just to do what they say they're gonna do. If there is a consequence for this behavior, then you have to follow through with that consequence. That's hard for parents because they want their child to have fun, they want their child to, to be the best that they can be. I had a, a, a family in my office, just last week, and a lot of inconsistent parenting. The father was enabling the, the daughter in essence and the mother was the one who wanted to stand firm and they did not see that dynamic. What was happening, Thom, is that the young lady was manipulating between the two, she was splitting. So I had to help the parents see, especially the dad, see that this is really kinda productive to what you're trying to do which is to develop and raise a responsible child. This enabling is really hurting her. And, ah, he did come around a little bit, but like with, with kids, you know, when you're, when you're learning how to surf, it may take a long time, but you have to keep getting up out of the water and getting back on your board. So that's how I work with parents. 

00:24:25
THOM PANCELLA We had another complication, but the common one, the broken home, the broken family. 

00:24:30
DACIA MOORE Yeah, yeah. 

00:24:35
THOM PANCELLA And how do you, how do you work within that structure? A lack of structure? 

00:24:35
DACIA MOORE That does add a different dimension to, uhm, intervention and to the counseling that I do and-- because you, you have a different set of rules in one family than you have in the other. But it's, it's really analogous to what happens with many teenagers who have a certain set of rules in the neighborhood and then you have a different set of rules at, at ho-- at school. Uhm, you may have to be very defensive and aggressive in the neighborhood, but that doesn't work at school. So the conversation is, ah, an intervention that I do with the child and in that respect is to talk about in different environments you behave differently. Ah, I'm behaving differently in this environment than I would if I were at home on the couch. So you have to learn how to adjust and be flexible based on the environment, uhm, ah, where you find yourself. So it-- that's the kind of conversation that I have with, uhm, I'd say middle school to, to highschool students, some of the younger, ah, children that I have in my practice and the youngest that I take right now is 10, 10 years old. But I have that conversation with them, it takes them a little bit longer to understand. But if they want to be successful at mom's house, then you have to follow mom's rules, dad's rules maybe different, that doesn't make them wrong or better, they're just different. So it is a little confusing to go back, to toggle back and forth. But that's their reality. And so we talk about how to accept that reality and how to, uhm, to move forward in it. From an intervention standpoint, ah, with REBT, the issue might be, well, uhm, there might be some irrational believes surrounding mom's house or dad's house, and I would deal with that as well. 

00:26:30
THOM PANCELLA Cyberbullying. 

00:26:30
DACIA MOORE Ah, yes. 

00:26:30
THOM PANCELLA I'd like to talk about it from both perspectives, working with somebody who is being bullied and somebody who is a bully. 

00:26:35
DACIA MOORE Yeah. Well, uhm, studies show that bullies are three times more likely to become juvenile delinquents and be involved in the criminal justice system. That's the most rec-- recent research that I've read. Targets on the other hand are-- have a high likelihood of depression, isolation, and low self-esteem. So bullying is an issue that is it's not good for anybody. And bystanders, uhm, they're at risk for a lot of negative behaviors as well. I have a chapter in the book on bullying. Uhm, I think for-- to be a successful-- or to have a successful bullying program, and there are many out there, you really have to work with the bystanders. And then you have to understand the, the reason for bullying. There are three reasons for bullying. One is power and control, that's the one we most often assume is going on, this child is not having-- uhm, doesn't have any power at home, so they want power in school. But that is, that is one reason to bully. Another reason that a child bullies is for feelings of incompetence. Maybe there's a skills deficit or a social skills deficit in terms of, ah, I'm gonna bully the nerd because he's smarter than me or I'm gonna bully that good reader over there because I'm such a poor reader, I didn't learn how to read. So that could be a motivation for bullying. And then the third motivation for bullying is revenge. This person did something to me and I'm going to get them back, I'm gonna bully them back. So you really have to look at the reason or the motivation behind the bullying and then target your intervention based on whatever that motivation is. The most difficult and persistent, uhm, ah, reason for bullying is the power and control and that is the most difficult one to, to intervene because we all like to feel powerful, we all wanna feel it's a measure of control. Ah, so it's very difficult to get that bully to relinquish that power. Ah, but it is possible, it is possible, you have to use, ah, empathy or teach empathy, you ha-- there, there are many things that you have to do. One thing that you don't wanna do is to put the bully and the target in the same group or in the same room. It's very much like a domestic violence imbalance of power. So you have to treat the bully separately, maybe in the anti-bullying group, and you have to treat the target separately. With the targets, you wanna teach them assertiveness skills. Many times targets are very, uhm, they're isolated, they're timid, uhm, they don't respond well. They are reasons why they're being targeted. So you're trying to teach and improve their social skills on the passive end of the continuum. Of course, the bullies are on the aggressive end of the continuum and you're trying to help them reduce their aggressive tendency and be more assertive. So you're trying to get both groups to come in the middle to assertiveness versus aggression or passivity. 

00:29:45
THOM PANCELLA And you talk about, ah, people who bully being more likely to become involved in the criminal justice system. 

00:29:50
DACIA MOORE Yeah. Uh-hmm. 

00:29:55
THOM PANCELLA Uhm, do you consider the-- getting involved in the cri-- criminal justice system falling off of the board, is that a point where so-- where that-- there's people who can still be brought back in? And do you work with people who are already involved in the criminal justice system? 

00:30:05
DACIA MOORE I have not-- ah, recently when I was in residential treatment, of course, we worked with young people who were headed in that direction or there could-- there were a few students from, ah, DYS who were in our school. Yes, I would say, they have fallen off the board and they're way out in the ocean, ah, and their board has floated away. So they, they have a little bit more difficulty navigating the ocean to get back to their board. It is possible, I think it takes a lot of hard work on their part. But I was at a graduation on Sunday with the-- ah, an alternative school that I work with. And one of the young ladies talked about being in McCune or Hilltop, one of the two, and just being directionalist in her life, she lost her board, but she was able to come back and find it out of, uhm, or because of other dealts in her life who continued to believe in her. So that is key, I do think it's possible, it's based on internal motivation, she was motivated to turn her life around because she had a son and she wanted a better life for her son, that was her, uhm, kind of her tipping point. If a person doesn't have a tipping point, if they don't have a belief that I can do better, that I am able to do better, that I-- that there's light at the end of the tunnel, I'm, I'm not sure how, uhm, how well interventions work, but then I'm not an expert in that area-- in that particular area. But I think, you know what, hopes brings eternal. It really-- ah, I don't wanna give up on anybody. I see my job as a farmer where I am planting good seeds, it's your job to take it or leave it, and, uhm, that's, that's up to you, that's based on, you know, what you want your life to be. 

00:31:50
THOM PANCELLA All right. Well, let's give another tip to our, to our mental health professionals in the audience. What would you like-- what kind of message would you like them to have? 

00:32:00
DACIA MOORE Well, ah, the message that I want them to have, Thom, and, and this is the message that I give to my students at Webster is it is really important in my opinion for them to go deep in one particular modality. Many mental health professionals say they are eclectic and so what that means is they, they choose from, you know, cognitive behavior, REBT, (inaudible ), Adler, you know, they're, they're picking and choosing. And what I find is it's important for them to have a solid foundation in one modality and then branch off from there. My modality of course is REBT, but when I have a, a client in front of me who maybe is struggling with grief issues, I'm not gonna use REBT because their irrational beliefs might not be presenting themselves at that point, I would use client-centered. So I would like to share with the clinicians who are working-- ah, who are watching to go deep in one particular modality to really get good at it by going to different workshops and so on and so forth and then branch off from there. So that's what I'd like to leave with them. 

00:33:05
THOM PANCELLA All right. Well, I would like to connect people with resources and obviously we have great resource right here with your book. But what other resources do you like to hook people up with? 

00:33:15
rebt.org 

00:33:15
DACIA MOORE Well, I am an REBT fan, so I would say go to the Albert Ellis Institute dot-com site. There are many great books or the practitioner's guide for REBT, how they work with the children and teens using REBT, there are many good, uhm, resources on that site. There's also the, ah, cognitive behavioral therapy site, or CBT.com, I believe it is, uhm, or you can just Google CBT. Those are the two main ones that I work with. I also do a lot in terms of existentialism. You know, we have hope, we all have a purpose in our lives. So to find somebody who maybe as good with existentialism, but to get connected to, uhm, resources like the Missouri Institute Mental Health, never stop learning and connect with other professionals and have discussion on how, uhm, different therapeutic modalities work so that you can be even more, uhm, effective with the clients that you work with.
