DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  The next film contains part of a session between a client and therapist. The client had been seeing the therapist, for a few month prior to the session. First, you will see part of the recorded session followed by some of the therapist recall. 

00:01:00
Client and Therapist 

00:01:00
WANDA (inaudible ) like a slap in her face, I'm gonna be kick out of it, and finally get hurt, and got back at her I guess, there's not, too many times that I get to do that. 

00:01:20
HALL Do you think it sank in to her? (crosstalk) 

00:01:20
WANDA Oh, yeah, she start crying, yeah, she start crying, (crosstalk) 

00:01:20
HALL Uh hmm. 

00:01:20
WANDA  crying on till I said "hey." I mean, "I don't need the hassle," and I hang up on her. And I never hang up on my mother, (laugh) 

00:01:35
HALL  Something, (crosstalk) 

00:01:40
WANDA And my father know. 

00:01:40
HALL something this time enable you to do something that's really been hard to do. And I wonder what it is? What's change? 

00:01:45
WANDA  I guess, I'm being alone to grow up, ah, why I see things in a different perspective. I feel that I'm getting ah, hmm, how do you say that, stronger. I'm getting to see these people, that I didn't see before, and uhm, I don't link, what I, have had to see, in order to become stronger. But I benefited from it, and even if, they were my parents, and still are, ah, that doesn't mean I have to give it to 'em, anymore. I use to rap, everytime they said, "Bloom(ph)." And ah, I don't need that. 

00:02:55
HALL No more, no more happened(ph)? 

00:02:55
WANDA  No, there's(ph) not a whole lot choice. (laugh) Ah, when I get, you know, tired or vulnerable or whatever. Then, the odds are greater for me to get back right, you know, weaker to be more susceptible to him I guess. 

00:03:20
HALL  I wonder if they can kind of sense it, when you're weak. You know, you've tell me sometimes, almost as if they have kind of a rasar that(ph), especially, your ex-husband that seems, seems to have happened, you'd be weak and, ah, somehow, something, would come across and he had know that this was a, a time to take advantage of you. 

00:03:45
WANDA They know exactly where to take advantage of me. 

00:03:50
HALL They know your weak spots? 

00:03:50
WANDA Yeah, they know than better than I do. This is seem to always be able to hit on it. 

00:04:00
[sil.] 

00:04:00
WANDA  You know, yesterday, when I told the kids' father that, ah, there wasn't going to be anymore hassle. Well, I'd ask him, to buy boots for the kids, because he makes 1,400 a month. You know? 

00:04:25
HALL Uh-huh. 

00:04:25
WANDA And, I know, that I'm still on ADC(ph), and, so anyway this is why the kids are trying to call him, so that they would, he would, help out. And he never did get anything for the kids. She went to school and she start crying, in the bathroom, she wouldn't go into the classroom because the teacher, the day before I told him that they definitely had to, have boots, and everything(ph) so. Anyway, I (sigh) get a call from the school, stating, you know, that she really needed(ph) them. So, the teacher said that, "She would try, to ask somebody that she knew off." Ah, some of her friends, if she could get a pair of boots, and she didn't but she took up a collection. 

00:05:20
HALL  He really gets to you? Her kind of asking from charity like that, and here is your ex-husband with all of his money, your kids father? 

00:05:40
[sil.] 

00:05:40
WANDA  Yeah. 

00:05:50
[sil.] 

00:05:50
WANDA  So, I went down to the school and picked up the money, and, ah, I got her some boots they're really nice. 

00:06:05
[sil.] 

00:06:05
WANDA  But here they have. 

00:06:15
[sil.] 

00:06:15
WANDA  A father (sniffs) that puts out a beautiful, I think ah, a beautiful front that he cares and he ignores them completely. I don't really like to ask him for money but my (inaudible ), it seems like, he would really want to start doing something. You know, the big show is there. 

00:06:50
HALL Hmm, all show and no go. 

00:06:50
WANDA  Yeah. 

00:06:55
HALL Yeah(ph) 

00:06:55
WANDA  I don't really like to take anything from anybody. And it's awfully, I mean, I really appreciate it, you know, what they did. But, uhm, it wouldn't ah, really had to be necessary, if, ah, he had played his part. 

00:07:20
HALL And his part is what? 

00:07:25
WANDA His, ah. 

00:07:30
[sil.] 

00:07:30
WANDA  Being the father, being concern... (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
HALL Uh-huh. 

00:07:35
WANDA ...I mean, caring whether they, ah, he have seen(ph) his first. 

00:07:40
HALL Uh-huh. 

00:07:40
WANDA Ah, it's always been that way, and I don't why I keep thinking that, you know, sometime that he would really start changing. (chuckles) 

00:07:50
HALL  You know, it's hard to give up a hope like that, isn't it? 

00:07:55
WANDA  Yeah, (laughs) but I guess, I've hoped all my life. 

00:08:00
[sil.] 

00:08:00
WANDA  And I can see the kids going without, I don't like to see it. 

00:08:05
Recall Session: Therapist 

00:08:05
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  You will now view an individual recall session with the therapist. Again, you may find a therapist's thoughts and feelings interesting, and may want to consider how this process might be valuable to the therapist or to you, if you were the therapist. 

00:08:40
WANDA That back at her I guess, there's not too many times that I get to do that. 

00:08:45
HALL I knew there was something bothering her, ah, I, I knew we could have a regular session here, that it wouldn't take too long and I wanted that to happened but still in my mind there was, Gee, I hope we're not wasting tape, you know and, (laughs) ah, and, and also wasting Wanda's time. Ah, you know, she did have something, it just happened, you know, coming in to the studio here, she said, "A lot happened." And I said, "Well, let's wait, till, you know, let's not have the session out in the hallway." So I was really saying to her, we're gonna, get something accomplished today. 

00:09:25
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. Uh-huh 

00:09:25
HALL I think the theme of therapy with Wanda, yeah, in a sense, can be seen in this interview, (crosstalk) 

00:09:30
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:09:30
HALL  the whole course(ph) of therapy is aimed towards freeing herself from, ah, needing a, an approval from parental figures. 

00:09:40
WANDA  Well, tired or vulnerable or whatever. Then, the odds are greater for me to get back right. You know, weaker to be more susceptible to him I guess. 

00:10:00
HALL I wonder if they can kind of sense it, when you're weak, you know, you tell me sometimes, almost as if they had kind of a radar of it(ph). 

00:10:10
HALL I do have a tendency to lead(ph) a little too much in therapy, although, I'm getting over it. I'm, or maybe I'm just doing it in more subtle ways, I have to learn about that, ah, so I wanna stay clear from that, especially with somebody that really needs to own their accomplishments in therapy, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:10:25
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. That's it, it brings up an interesting question that, a brisks ah, were there any risk that you are perceiving, ah, other than that or in addition to that, that note of caution? 

00:10:35
HALL  Ah, the risk I think, ah, is an, is, the, the risk that the caution is involve with, is simply producing a model, ah, cure, so to speak in quotes, you know, where the person can intellectualize and ah, they don't owe it themselves it's all tied in with therapy, my therapist really did this, instead of I did it myself. 

00:11:10
HALL  Especially, your ex-husband that seems, seem to have happened you'd be weaken(ph)? Ah, somehow, something would come across and he'd know it this was a, a time to take advantage of you? 

00:11:25
WANDA  They know exactly where to take advantage of me. 

00:11:30
HALL They know your weak spots? 

00:11:30
WANDA  Yeah(ph), they know than better than I do. This is seem to always be able to hit on it. 

00:11:40
HALL Well, I see that as her, as the dilemma that she has, how did they know? They, self defeating answer to that question that she tell herself is they know because, they know what's best for me. Ah, you know, parents are always right and this sort of thing they, they would and when I'm trying to get her to look at now and I don't think really succeed in this session, but we'll eventually is, ah, they have that radar for other reasons in caring about you. Ah, that you can see the perplex look on her face that say, "how the hell do they know? How do they know when I'm weak?" And I think the, the answer that she tells herself was very self-distructive. They know because, ah, it shows and it's bad to be weak and I radiate weakness and they come and give my do(ph). You know, and, and kind of the notion that if anyone else, when you're weak, sympathy is appropriate or for her when you're weak, you're suppose to get stumped on. You know? 

00:12:55
UNKNOWN Uh huh. 

00:12:55
HALL Ah, she rise down in front of the door. Somebody comes in, they suppose to walk over her. Anyone else they'd say, "why are you lying down in front of the door, I don't wanna step on you." 

00:13:05
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:13:05
HALL You know, and, and that's again, the dilemma I think, that, that she feels, why her, why me? And, then, she answers it, "why? Because I'm Wanda." 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN And, you, what do you feeling at that moment? 

00:13:20
HALL Oh, it seems, I'm feeling pretty good, because, ah, she's building a foundation. We found over this before we go over it again, and again, and again, in different ways, from different angles, but, she's working it out rationally she's, she is approaching, coming to an understanding of really, the (inaudible ) in this peace(ph), just a lot of people, with a lot of problems, who sometimes inadvertently and sometimes deliberately appear to each other and she is tended to be the victim. And there are people who gravitate towards victims, you know, okay. 

00:14:05
WANDA She didn't but she took up a collection. 

00:14:10
HALL  He really gets to you? Her kind of asking for charity like that and here is your ex-husband with all his money? Your kids father? 

00:14:30
[sil.] 

00:14:30
WANDA  Yeah(ph). 

00:14:35
[sil.] 

00:14:35
WANDA  So I went down to the school and picked up the money, and ah, I got her some boots they're really nice. 

00:14:55
[sil.] 

00:14:55
HALL  And the, the sense there at that time was, she's got to feel that hurt, that humiliation. Ah, innocence, maybe you can wallow in it a little. And I knew, I was helping her to do that I was pointing out, not in the angry way like he's, your kids father damn(ph) it, and he has a responsibility to them. I didn't say it that way, I said, "I didn't knew, with a little more sadness." Because I feel and it's a hard thing to do, but she's got to go, and feel that sadness and we have to feel that pain, you just can't clack her out of the pain and say, "Get mad." 

00:15:40
UNKNOWN Uh huh. 

00:15:40
HALL Ah, she'll get mad. Ah, but I think she also has to be very much aware of the pain, that, that man has inflected on her. 

00:15:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) you were having? 

00:15:55
HALL No, it goes to my mind that bastard, you know, here, he's making $1,400 a month, and, and your in ADC(ph) and your kids have to take a collection, to get the necessities of life. It's winter and, and, it's getting slash in, snowy out and, they can't even have boots and he's gonna dangle those boots and make you jump. You know, so there's an anger in there towards him, ah, that flash(ph) to me but that's not that relevant and you know, it enables me to feel I think, something that hopefully she'll be able to feel not quite yet. 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN  Uh-huh. 

00:16:30
HALL I mean, his, no people don't get away with that kind of thing with me but that's not relevant, you know, to her... (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:16:35
HALL ...except that she can look at me, I suppose, perhaps as a model. But at this point, she's not even there yet. And there's a, a profound sense of, of responsibility when I lead her to feel more intensely to sadness. You know, I don't do that likely ah. (crosstalk) 

00:17:00
UNKNOWN What does that feel like to you? 

00:17:00
HALL (sigh) Well, there are two feelings, one is I know I have to do it, because for me that's the way therapy works. Ah, and the people that I work with change you know, I know that in my head and that's what I have to do, but there's a sense of pray(ph), again I wish I didn't have to do it, the painful way. You know, I don't see any virtue in pain but you are guilty you know and, and, if there is a way that I could think of to ease it and still have the person own it. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:17:30
HALL which is, you know, we get into the whole thing, you know, why do doctors give so many tranquilizers, you know, ah, it eases the pain, but they don't know on that anybody can take a pill. 

00:17:40
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:17:40
HALL  Hmm, okay. 

00:17:45
UNKNOWN Well, what does it do to you? 

00:17:45
HALL Ah, it makes me feel, just in oral(ph) of my responsibility ah, of the feelings that, I don't particularly have to take it home with me and she does. 

00:18:00
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:18:00
HALL  Ah, you know, there's an unfairness in that I suppose but, ah, as long as I feel the inequity of me and listening very intense feelings, and feeling them in the session sure, you know, I'm involved in the session but not afterwards. You know, generally, I leave it behind and either go on to, and see my next client or you know, go home or do something, you know, and, and put it aside. And all these people that I work with they can't do that. 

00:18:35
WANDA  A father (sniffs), that puts them on a beautiful I think ah, a beautiful front(ph), that he cares and he ignores them completely. I don't really like to ask him for money, but my (inaudible ), it seems like, he would really want to start doing something. You know, the big show is there. 

00:19:05
HALL  Hmm, all show and no go. 

00:19:10
WANDA Yeah. 

00:19:10
HALL Hmm. I was, I was really feeling that bad, I'm mad inside for Wanda, because, that's why she hurt so much, is because everyone in her life that could have given her love and so on was all show and no go, and the show was well, your mother suppose to like you, is it, your father suppose to love you and so on? And the issue becomes at times in reflection, not when I'm with her a little sometimes, I guess when I'm with her, with an individual client is, the global sense of, why do people screw each other up like this? Why do parents do this to their kids? There's a, indignation inside of me. Bordering(ph) at times on range like, you know, look what, look what you're, all show and no go can do this to somebody, look how much she's hurting. Ah, ah, and to use a term like, all show and no good, that's an angry term, you know, that's, ah, hi, I'm a good parent, you know, look at, look, you know, I dress up my little girl in this pretty little dresses and it doesn't matter that I force you into this thing that's you know, tight and hurts and, that doesn't matter but look it showing. 

00:20:25
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:20:25
HALL  I get mad, you know, I wanna put that angry to use, ah, and there're ways that, to put it to use it, that I can see, you know, with, with Wanda it, it's, a very gentle kind of gradual, ah, saying here, "You can have some of my anger, anytime you want it, try not to force on it too much." But, when you need some of that anger and I got plenty of, you can just deep in and take a little and you can put it, and whoever hurt you and, and I hope she can do that sometimes. And I think just talking about it to me like this in the sometimes encouraging her, ah, giving her permission in a sense, not to feel angry, it helps. 

00:21:10
UNKNOWN  Anything? 

00:21:15
HALL Well, nothing except that, well, as I see myself there I know I was angry not at her, (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:21:20
HALL at all, I mean, no, not at all angry at her, but angry at those people who've hurt her. 

00:21:25
UNKNOWN Yeah(ph), and your... (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
HALL Hmm. 

00:21:25
UNKNOWN ...feeling for her at that point. 

00:21:30
HALL Well, it's kind of, "come on, get tough kid," you know, instead what the feeling was. 

00:21:35
UNKNOWN Did she know it? 

00:21:40
HALL Maybe not at that time, but I, I suspect that time that she knows it, 'coz ah. (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
UNKNOWN Did, do you want her to know it? 

00:21:45
HALL I want her to know, not so much that, it's my feeling but that, it's kind of good to feel that way, it's good to feel tough, and know that you've, you stood up to somebody that's been kicking you around and of a lot, and made an impact on them. Earlier in the interview she mentions, she got through to her mother and her mother broke down and cried. Well, in a sense, she may take that two ways, one, that well, maybe she really does care after all, which, all right, this is one way to look at it, but what got to her I think there was, I got true to her, I have some power myself, I'm not at her mercy. And that's what I wanna help her feel. 

00:22:25
WANDA It didn't, and really have to be necessary, if, ah, he had played his part. 

00:22:30
HALL  And his part is what? 

00:22:35
WANDA His, ah. 

00:22:40
[sil.] 

00:22:40
WANDA  Being the father, being concern I mean, caring. 

00:22:45
HALL  She's trying out the feelings, father's are suppose to be concerned, are suppose to care. And even that, the, the slight ah, assertiveness, over how she was talking earlier, is pleasing to me to see that you know, ah, it's, it's nice, she's going in the right direction, it's nice to see that. She's still asking permission to... (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:23:10
HALL  say those things, to feel those things, she's still questioning. But she's sitting up a tiny bit taller and she is nodding a little bit and she says it and ah, her facial expression has, you know, more self assurance in it, that's nice to see. You know, that's, that's starting to say, "I'm not gonna be a victim anymore," I mean, like that. 

00:23:35
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Well, now, that you have seen the interview and the recall, what does some of the issues that most impress you? How about the intensity of the therapist investment in the interaction, that genuine carrying and concern, the sweating(ph) it rather than being cool or distant? Notice also, that while Wanda, is talking about her pain, sadness, and helplessness, Hall feels anger as he described it, bothering(ph) on rage. Where is that coming from? Is he angry only because Wanda has been hurt or is he picking up an anger that she feels, but cannot express as openly or as intensely as she feels it? In addition, what did you think of the bind, the therapist describes when he mentions his concern about becoming one more authority figure on the client works to please. Does he feel it that Wanda will behave a new ways to please him rather than making changes in her life based on personal goals? Another intriguing aspect, was the therapist strategy, he wants her to experience the emotions, to feel the pain, to owe not to and talk about her feelings concerning what other people have done to her. He says, "She needs to feel this feelings, maybe even wallow in them." Do you agree that the person has to feel the intensity of their emotions first, before they can change? Why or why not? Well, if he's right, perhaps we need to experience our emotional reactions fully before we can recognize them, label them, and embrace them as our own. 

00:25:25
UNKNOWN As Dr. Kagan said in the introductory tape, "We need to inform one part of the brain, about the content of other parts of the brain. Implicit in this statement is that we need to allow the feeling sent to us to express themselves before the language sent to us can label the experience and words. 

00:25:45
DR. HENYA KAGAN(KLEIN) Perhaps, both experiencing the emotion and labeling it, are equally important parts of growth and change. Does that make sense to you? What are some of the recall behaviors which made an impression on you? This next film is individual recall with the client. First, part of the session will be shown, followed by the clients recall. 

00:26:10
Client and Therapist 

00:26:10
WANDA  I don't know the reasons. I don't know, what I do or what I say. 

00:26:25
HALL  You're feeling it has something to do with you. Why are you rela. (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
WANDA Yeah. That's the way I got. When I have time to sphere(ph) and I'm not I, why doesn't, you know. Why, why I may not involved in something, you know. 

00:26:40
HALL And when you add that all up. Would you come up with? Do you come up with a reason? 

00:26:50
[sil.] 

00:26:50
WANDA  I can't. 

00:27:10
[sil.] 

00:27:10
HALL  Familiar feeling, again. 

00:27:15
WANDA What? 

00:27:15
HALL  A familiar feeling. 

00:27:20
WANDA Right(ph), something is wrong with me. 

00:27:25
[sil.] 

00:27:25
HALL  So you shake your fist a little bit there. 

00:27:35
[sil.] 

00:27:35
HALL  Were you aware that you did that with your fist? Since something is wrong with me even(ph) like that. 

00:27:45
WANDA No, I did(ph). Shoot. 

00:27:55
HALL Shoot where to shoot me. 

00:27:55
WANDA  Oh, here I go again. 

00:28:00
HALL Can, I know you're feeling sad and I know that tears are starting to come. But I want to, he kind to look at the feeling of, "Here I go again." 

00:28:15
[sil.] 

00:28:15
WANDA  No, that does not buy me. 

00:28:25
HALL I don't know, what ah, its just gonna went bother(ph) me. Can you kinda grab it? 

00:28:35
[sil.] 

00:28:35
HALL  Something is stock somewhere. 

00:28:50
WANDA Yeah. 

00:28:50
HALL Where is it stock? 

00:28:50
[sil.] 

00:28:50
WANDA  I keep wondering why you, what are, what is that I do or what is it that I say, if it's how I say it. Uhm, because it seems like everybody else is got something going on. You know, I can make things happen but they don't last, nothing ever last. It's, it's for awhile and then that's it. Then we get. 

00:29:25
HALL Does it make any sense to you? 

00:29:30
WANDA Hmm. Get know, I messed up. 

00:29:35
HALL  What's that? 

00:29:40
WANDA Do you know what I mean? 

00:29:40
HALL Yeah, things start getting good. 

00:29:45
WANDA Yeah. 

00:29:45
HALL And just start enjoying it. 

00:29:45
WANDA Right. 

00:29:45
HALL And then. 

00:29:50
WANDA Something happens. 

00:29:50
HALL Something happens and you never know what. 

00:29:50
WANDA  No. I don't know if it's, if I get to pushy or ah, but it, like you say, I like that something that I say or something that I do. I don't know what it is. But it seems nice things come to an end. 

00:30:10
HALL  Is there a point, where you really starting to enjoy yourself? That then it comes to an end. 

00:30:25
WANDA Yeah, because I usually make it come to that. And he(ph) say. 

00:30:30
UNKNOWN Can we talk about that, long(ph)? 

00:30:35
WANDA  But I don't really know how, God, I don't, I don't really know how I make it come to an end. I mean it seems like that's what happened. 

00:30:45
HALL Cause that, are you saying you make it come an end because that's what you feel, because you just fake it, that's what it must be. 

00:31:00
[sil.] 

00:31:00
HALL  Doesn't(ph) seem to just happen on its own, is what I'm asking? 

00:31:10
[sil.] 

00:31:10
WANDA  It's like if I get carried away. When something starts going good, it's like if I get carried away, and then I get carried away too much. It's like if I change personality you know, from someone quite and then I start. (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
HALL Yeah. 

00:31:25
WANDA  I don't know, I get all, get all. 

00:31:35
[sil.] 

00:31:35
HALL  It's kinda like being a kid with a dish of ice cream and you're not sure how long you have to eat it. That is your favorite ice cream. You're not sure if someone is gonna come in and take it away any seconds. You got, gobble it up. 

00:31:50
WANDA Right. It felt like I'm not just after all. What is that? 

00:31:55
[sil.] 

00:31:55
HALL  You'd getting to try how other... (crosstalk) 

00:32:05
WANDA Try to say if that. 

00:32:05
HALL ...people see it, but I'm kinda wanting to look it how you feel about it. What that must be like? 

00:32:10
WANDA I do, what I come across something happen here or something good. I don't want it for more(ph) to set up, but it does. 

00:32:20
HALL  When you start getting that good feeling. Is it kinda like that ice cream again? That it's so good and, but you're sure if it's gonna go away. So you wanna get it quick, keep eating it. 

00:32:35
WANDA All right. All right. It's just, I mean, just like you know, when I go dancing or something. I can go and I go and go and go. You know, then all of a sudden, can't take anymore. I mean, I go to an extreme, there's no happy medium. You know, I either going off a lot there, I don't go it off a lot. 

00:33:00
HALL Uh hmm. 

00:33:00
WANDA Either it's there or it isn't there. No. 

00:33:10
[sil.] 

00:33:10
WANDA  If I can think of a word. 

00:33:20
[sil.] 

00:33:20
WANDA  No happy medium, no stability and I mean, it's either up or down. You know, there's no, it's not level. I should be, it's seems like I should be content, hmm, I wanna be content, where no matter what I'm doing. But if I'm not doing something then I, instead of being content, find something to do, then I go into a depressive state. Simply(ph) because if I'm not involved in something, then somethings wrong with me. Nobody is asking me to do anything. 

00:33:55
HALL  It's miserable isn't? If you don't have something to do you're unhappy. Now when you do have something to do that's fun, you end up not really enjoying it. 

00:34:15
[sil.] 

00:34:15
HALL  Stop for awhile now. What we're gonna do is have, they have to come in and you're gonna go up with the tape. She's gonna sit here where I'm sitting and the tape of our conversation will be on that monitor there. And she'll tell you what she wants. You know, took me to look for and so on. And Wanda, I'd like you to be very frank as you're watching the tape and if you have any feelings about me at all, I'd like you to, to be able to talk about them. 

00:34:50

WANDA  Oh, here I go again. 

00:35:05
HALL Can, I know you're feelings sad and I know that tears are starting to come. But I wonder if you, you kinda look at the feeling of, "Here I go again." 

00:35:20
[sil.] 

00:35:20
WANDA  I think ah, like when I was growing up. It was some, I've always question myself that way, my whole life. And I'm still questioning myself. 

00:35:50
[sil.] 

00:35:50

00:36:05
[sil.] 

00:36:05
WANDA Uhm. Yes. Why, I don't know, I guess I question why. Why I don't feel like somebody... (crosstalk) 

00:36:15
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:36:15
WANDA ...whether than nobody. 

00:36:20
WANDA If I get to pushy or ah, but it, like you say, I like that something that I say or something that I do. I don't know what it is. But it seems nice things come to an end. 

00:36:35
HALL Is there a point, where you really starting to enjoy yourself? But then it comes to an end. 

00:36:45
WANDA  Yeah, because I usually make it come to an end. And he(ph) say. 

00:36:55
HALL Can we talk about that now? 

00:36:55
WANDA  But I don't God. I don't, I don't, I don't really know how I make it. 

00:37:00
WANDA  When I mentioned something about when things come to an end. Ah. 

00:37:15
[sil.] 

00:37:15
WANDA  Uhm, it's like I go so far. And then I, I don't wanna be used. I mean, things get going so good. It's hard for me to believe how good they are going and that knowing really what to expect afterwards. So I stop it before I got with the results are. 

00:37:45
UNKNOWN And even the things you would have like how he'll think about you while you were, while he was talking to you? 

00:37:50

00:37:55
UNKNOWN Like a little kid? 

00:37:55
WANDA Yeah. 

00:37:55
UNKNOWN You think how he saw you as a little kid. Do you think, that's how he saw you?

WANDA  That's how I think everybody sees me. 

00:38:10
UNKNOWN Everybody sees you, how would you like how he to see you? 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN  As a grown up woman. That's how I would like everyone to see me. But it's hard for me to see that other people see that. 

00:38:30
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:38:30
WANDA I mean, it's like I think of a, just like, it's like I know what other people is thinking before they have to say it. And there's a time that, I mean, it's, it's like I think these things before people, I think they're saying him. 

00:38:55
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:38:55
WANDA And not necessarily so. 

00:38:55

00:39:05
[sil.] 

00:39:05
WANDA  I don't know. 

00:39:15
[sil.] 

00:39:15
WANDA  Sometimes afraid, I'm ah, sometimes I'm afraid to find out what other people were thinking. Ah, you know, for fear I might sort of reinforce, how I really feel about myself, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN Uhm hmm. 

00:39:30
HALL  When you start getting that good feeling. Is it kinda like that ice cream again? That it's so good and, but you're not sure if it's gonna go away. So you wanna get it quick, keep eating it. 

00:39:45
WANDA All right. When Hall asked uhm, me about the ice cream? 

00:39:55
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:39:55
WANDA That I just want to keep eating it maybe... (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:39:55
WANDA  I want just like a, attention. To me it was like uhm, I always wanted to get attention when I was younger. 

00:40:10
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:40:10
WANDA And when I did get it, very rare. But when I get it. 

00:40:15
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:40:15
WANDA I mean it's like I'm wanted the whole of you know like, see I am important. 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:40:20
WANDA  That's, that's what reminded me of the ice cream. 

00:40:25
UNKNOWN How good. (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
WANDA What's I got a little bit of it. 

00:40:30
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:40:30
WANDA I wanted more. 

00:40:30
UNKNOWN So you felt that Hall understood what you were saying, that he was right with you. 

00:40:35
WANDA Right. Right. (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. Would there any things that you were thinking that you would have like to have said at that point to Hall? But then you didn't say. 

00:40:55
[sil.] 

00:40:55
WANDA  I just wanted to be no noticed by someone. 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN  Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
WANDA I felt like I was recognized from someone. 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
WANDA  That I got thoughts and feelings. 

00:41:15
[sil.] 

00:41:15
WANDA  But it's hard for someone to see me that I really do have them. 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN That you have got some feelings. 

00:41:25
WANDA  Yeah. 

00:41:30
UNKNOWN And this was going through your mind, when Hall and you were talking? 

00:41:30
WANDA  Yeah. Despite(ph) what I. 

00:41:40
[sil.] 

00:41:40
WANDA  That's why I want to keep eating more the ice cream. 

00:41:45
UNKNOWN  Uh hmm. 

00:41:50
WANDA I think and because if I'm not involved in something, then somethings wrong with me. Nobody is asking me to do anything. 

00:41:55
HALL  It's miserable isn't? 

00:42:00
WANDA  When I was growing up. The, the inconsistent part was, ah, I remember asking my parents I don't know if this is relevant or not. To go somewhere. 

00:42:20
UNKNOWN  Uh hmm. 

00:42:25
UNKNOWN And I go back and forth, back and forth to find out if I would be, I have permission to go. And neither one of them, one with the responsibility of making that decision and it was, and I'd go from one parent to the another parent for hours until I got so exhausted. I didn't care if I would go or not to get(ph). You know and I felt like I was really left out why couldn't somebody make a decision and this is, sometimes it's awfully hard for me to make a decision. 

00:42:55
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:42:55
HENYA KAGAN(KLEIN) Do you see any changes from the previous session in which you saw Hall's recall? There seems to be a fairly dramatic shift in Wanda's thinking from focusing being a passive victim to questioning what her own role is. She clearly describes one thing to be seen as an adult women with thoughts and feelings but that she makes it hard for people to see her that way. How does the self-fulfilling prophecy work for her? "Things get going so good and then I get afraid and stop it. I'm afraid to find out what people are thinking for fear they may reinforce I feel." This film contains segments from the mutual recall session between the client and her psycho-therapist. First, a bit of explanation is needed. Immediately after Wanda's client recall session. She and Hall had another interview. This post session was recorded and the mutual recall session was then conducted. During this interview part, Wanda told Hall about some of the things she had learned from the client recall. She then spoke about her children and that perhaps she could grant herself a brief vacation from them. Here are segments from the mutual recall of Hall and Wanda. 

00:44:15
Mutual Recall Session: Client and Therapist 

00:44:15
UNKNOWN  Hmm, Wanda and Hall. Ah, ah, you've been through recall, in the mutual recall if either of you remembers anything he was thinking or feeling. Uhm, I'll hold the switch if you just give me any kind of a hand signal or a gesture, anything say something I'll stop the tape. 

00:44:40
HALL Okay. 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:44:40
HALL Sure. 

00:44:40
WANDA Okay. 

00:44:45
[sil.] 

00:44:45
WANDA  Time. 

00:44:50
HALL Hmm. 

00:44:50
WANDA As just long time is like I, (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
HALL  Hmm. 

00:45:00
WANDA ...I got a lot of bottled up feelings that I not really get enough, that I'll take it. 

00:45:05
HALL That came up while you were talking to her? 

00:45:05
WANDA No, just by looking at me in the, in the screen. I look like I was really a confused person. You know. 

00:45:15
HALL Confused. Where, where you seen something there that you hadn't seen before, sometimes? (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
WANDA I'd never seen myself before. 

00:45:25
HALL Do you have any feelings or thoughts about what you saw, seeing yourself there? 

00:45:35
WANDA  That I'm looking for direction ah, to go to. 

00:45:45
[sil.] 

00:45:45
WANDA  Some kind of pattern in my life with (inaudible ), you know. 

00:46:00
HALL A pattern of direction ah, ah, a reason? 

00:46:05
WANDA Right. Yeah, okay. Yeah. 

00:46:05
[sil.] 

00:46:05
HALL  What, what I was thinking there you know, I was wondering this, it was almost as if we had picked where the first session that we had left do often end. Here we had an you know, I've been gone for an hour. I was wondering, I missed something cause I knew you were talking to that thing, you know and here you would almost back talking what we were, and we ended up talking about. I guess I was feeling there was a gap in her experience that I was missing in, hmm, you know, while you were talking to Debb(ph). I wasn't watching that or anything, I was you know, watching TV in the other room. I was really feeling that I missed something. 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:47:05
WANDA Like the direction that I wanna go, that I don't know which direction it is, I question my own direction. 

00:47:15
HALL Not so much and what you were saying but what you would just experienced before I came back. 

00:47:20
UNKNOWN How do that feel like for(ph)? 

00:47:20
HALL  Well, it didn't feel very good. It was like you know, we were working on some problems then maybe I'm, you know, I sort of, I had sort of wanted to watch the session with the (inaudible ). You know, we decided not to do that, coming back there was a feeling and I was wondering what you would work done, what you'd talked about, what you'd, maybe had discovered. 

00:47:50
UNKNOWN  Wanda, did you sense that Hall was having those kinds of feelings at that moment? 

00:48:00
WANDA Oh, I don't think I sensed that. I just... (crosstalk) 

00:48:05
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:48:05
WANDA  seems like there was ah, uhm, I wasn't getting true to you at that kind of direction that I needed. I was like I needed you to tell me which direction I'm gonna go. You know, like ah, I need a direction which way to take you know, there's five hundred million ways. 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:48:25
WANDA Which way? 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN Well, we are hoping. (crosstalk) 

00:48:25
WANDA You know, it's like I'm asking. 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN I'm sorry. What were hoping Hall would, would do or say that time? 

00:48:30
WANDA  Ah. 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN  By then? 

00:48:40
WANDA To leave me, so I can follow. 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN Ah. 

00:48:40
WANDA  The easy way up. 

00:48:45
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:48:45
HALL I sensed she you wanted for me and that I was off the track and wondering what had happened. And I sensed you didn't wanna really talk about what had happened in the recall with Debb(ph) but you wanted to talk about finding a direction. 

00:49:00
WANDA Uh hmm. 

00:49:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:49:00
UNKNOWN  Anything else? Shall me go back to the tape? 

00:49:05
WANDA Okay. 

00:49:10
[sil.] 

00:49:10
WANDA  And I feel like, I'm reason to keep me from my kids. 

00:49:15
HALL  The kids just had enough reason. 

00:49:20
[sil.] 

00:49:20
WANDA  Hmm. They should be. 

00:49:30
HALL They should be? 

00:49:30
WANDA Yeah. 

00:49:30
HALL Who says they should be? 

00:49:30
WANDA  Well, I'm their mother. 

00:49:35
HALL Hmm. 

00:49:35
WANDA I'm their mother. I'm the only one in the world that's gonna take care of them. 

00:49:40
HALL And at that moment I was, sometimes I have say something like that to you like there. I'm very conscious of not wanting you to hear me condemning you. And as I look at you face their I'm wondering it's almost like you'rr apologizing to me. 

00:50:00
WANDA  Okay. 

00:50:05
HALL You know. (crosstalk) 

00:50:05
WANDA I'd seen that, I just seen that, you know. 

00:50:05
UNKNOWN How it that effect to you Hall, you sense that enough. (crosstalk) 

00:50:05
WANDA (inaudible ). 

00:50:08
HALL  I, I when I correct that feeling 'coz I don't wanna her to have to apologize to me and like if I phrasing sometimes in a way that sounds like I'm condemning you, you know I wanna do that 'coz I says what I'm feeling. 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN Tell me what you are feeling, I think. 

00:50:25
WANDA Oh, I didn't feel like he was condemning me. But I always feel like I've gotta give an explanation for everything I do. 

00:50:30
UNKNOWN  You feel you need kind of a time away from them to. 

00:50:35
WANDA  Yeah, I got... (crosstalk) 

00:50:40
HALL Just. 

00:50:40
WANDA ...to get to keep my head up... (crosstalk) 

00:50:40
HALL Yeah. 

00:50:40
WANDA ...in order to keep their heads up. And if they see me pulled down then ah, you know, they've got to have some kind of direction. 

00:50:50
[sil.] 

00:50:50
WANDA  Someones got to be there to hold them up. Just like I needed when I was a kid to be held up then I didn't feel it to be held up. And I don't want that to happen to my kids. I don't want them to be insecure and uhm, lack of person, yeah, worthy of being a person. 

00:51:20
HALL You wanna save your kids from what happen to you. 

00:51:25
WANDA  Any way I can. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN  Uh hmm. (inaudible) on that. (crosstalk) 

00:51:35
WANDA I needed a, I need a vacation that's what I need. She got a lot of load (laughs) shoulders. 

00:51:40
HALL Well. (crosstalk) 

00:51:40
WANDA I was try to believe that, that was me. Yeah. But yet I, I understood her. Ah, I really understood her. 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

00:51:55
HENYA KAGAN(KLEIN) What did you find interesting that the relationship between Hall and Wanda seem more equalized. Hall's previous role is the expert. The provider of treatment or authority figure was transformed into more of a professional partnership was Wanda. Would this have been possible earlier. Also noticeable was Wanda's interpersonal maturation. Her first interaction left her feeling weak, depressed and helpless. In this kind interaction, her new found strength surface and encouraging her to sit up taller and behave more assertively. Do you think this is a good example of what is meant by the term "empowering the client?"
