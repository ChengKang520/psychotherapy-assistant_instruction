THERAPY Talks 

00:01:35
NANCY BUCK I'm happy to share some good news with you. Your children did come with an instruction manual. I remember the very first time I heard a father say that to me. “If only my child came with an instruction manual. Holiday's toys come with an instruction manual. Furniture you need to put together comes with an instruction manual. Why doesn't the child come with an instruction manual?” And that's when I realized and said to him, “Here's the great news. Your child does come with an instruction manual. Here's the bad news. It's not written in English. In fact if you know any other language, it's not written in that language either.” So let me share with you the instruction manual that all children are born with. A couple of things I wanna add. Children grow up and become adults. You have this very same instruction manual inside of you. There is no expiration date on the instruction manual. So as I share this information with you, parents, with you, counselors who are working with parents, hopefully you'll also be able to begin to understand how it applies to you. Let me start by talking about some of the biological instructions that we're all born with. There are a whole bunch of biological instructions. We have the urge to, also sorry, let me say that we experience these instructions as an urge to behave. So we have the instruction to breathe air. We have the instruction to seek shelter. We have the instruction through hunger to eat. There's a whole bunch of biological instructions, those are not the instructions I'm gonna be talking about. I'm gonna be talking about the psychological instructions. But I do wanna mention the biological instruction of the very first one that I wanna talk about. So when I say your child experienced this, experiences this as an urge to behave, you'll really understand what I mean by this urge. All children at some point no longer are carried around, creep around, crawl around, eventually the child has the urge to stand upright on their hind legs. No adult has to get down on the ground and say, “Now's a good time honey, why don't you stand?” All by themselves a child will stand upright on their hind legs. Biologically we are creatures with that instruction born into us. Now, for those of you who have had the good fortune to watch children who stand for the very first time, what happens next? They fall. And what happens next? They get up and stand again. And what happens next? They fall again. And they stand and they fall and they stand and they fail over and over and over again. That's how strong that instruction is. Until they finally stand and succeed. Now come of those children stand and succeed and stop for a minute in great pride, ”Look what I can finally do.” But some children don't have time to waste feeling proud of themselves. They go to take their first step. And what happens? They fall. And they fail. And the process starts all over again. You see children understand that trying and failing is part of the learning process. Children get it. They get it way better than we do. The other interesting thing is nobody has to incentivize this child to stand when they're falling and failing, to incentivize them to do it again. Nobody has to give them that promise of a treat, or a sticker or some kind of accolade or reward. The child doesn't care about any of that. All they care about is following that genetic instruction of standing upright. So I hope you get it when I say children have an urge to behave and that's what it's about. This next piece of information I wanna share with you really comes from physiology as well as biology and it's based on the work of Bruce Lipton, a cellular biologist. One of the things that Bruce Lipton says is if you understand a single cell, you can understand an entire human being. That a human being is nothing more than a system of cooperative cells. And that if you understand how one cell goes, so goes the whole system. In fact he says a cancer cell is a cell that's gone rogue. It's not cooperating with the whole system. He says a single cell is in one of two positions only. It's either closed in protection or open for growth and learning. That's it. Closed in protection. Or open for growth and learning. And if we want our children to learn and we're trying to teach children, whether that's the parent who's trying to teach the child or the adult in school who's trying to teach the child or the grandmother or the aunt or the uncle, what we need to do is to create an environment where a child will be open for growth and learning. When I talk with parents one of the things that they often say to me is, “Your just too kind. You're trying to be too nice. It's all mushy gushy. These kids need to know it's serious business and that they need to take it seriously and I really need to punish this child so they understand if they don't do what I say, bad things are gonna happen.” Now when that happens, do you think the child is open for growth and learning? Or do you think they're in protection? Of course they're in protection. And if that happens long enough over time eventually what happens is the child begins to believe they need to protect themselves from their own parent. So our job is to create an environment where we're calm enough to talk with our child and teach them whatever it is that we wanna teach them. That's a very important idea. With that comes the very first of our psychological instructions that all children are born with. Children are born with the urge to feel safe and secure. And usually the first place that they feel safe and secure is with their parents, in their parents' arms, surrounded by the family. You probably have had the experience of watching a young child who begins the experience stranger danger, that's cause the child isn't quite sure that they feel safe with somebody other than the parent. Or perhaps you're working with parents who have a sense of stranger danger. And so you need to say it's just a developmental phase, this too shall pass. But the first instruction is the instruction for safety and security. The next is the instruction for love and belonging, connectedness, who are my people, who's my pack? Often the very first place a child will experience this is in the family, in the home and then it goes beyond into the neighborhood, the community. For those of you who have been maybe lucky enough to spend some time with preschool children you'll discover a wonderful thing. The child, the four year old comes in and says, “You're my best friend. You'll be my best friend forever. Oh. You're absent? You're my new best friend. You'll be my best friend forever.” They have a huge urge for love and belonging. And they try to connect with lots and lots of people. The next instruction all children are born with is the urge for power. Don't know if you're familiar with this picture, don't know if you're familiar with this story. It's an African tribe where they're having disagreements and the way they settle their disagreements is they all get together and solve the problem. Power with how can we figure things out so that it works for all of us? We have the urge for power. Some of it's power over, which is generally irresponsible. Power with. And the final is power within. Most of you may be familiar with the term self esteem. I use that same idea, except I call it power within. That child who can now stand on his hind legs by himself, he's awfully proud. That's a sense of power within. We wanna help our children learn to be able to meet their developmental tasks and when they can they get a sense of power within. We're all born with the urge for fun. Children have a huge urge for fun. You can't keep them from having it. If you're not convinced, take a child to church and what happens? Doctor Glasser, the man for which my program is based on choice theory psychology, says that fun is the genetic payoff for learning. And fun is also the secret weapon for parents. So if there's something you want your child to do and the child doesn't want to do it, turn it into a game and the child won't be able to resist. Now I don't mean to make it sound quite as manipulative as I'm making it sound. But it is. But the child knows at the end of it if you race them to bed, mostly cause you want them to get to bed and they don't wanna go to bed but you turn it into a race, the child knows at the end of it they're in bed. But they have, they're willing to have fun even if it means going to bed. Children have a huge desire for fun. Recently I was with my grandson. His mom was asking him please not to pound on the floor. His baby brother was downstairs sleeping. She didn't want the baby to be woken up. And I said, “Hey, Malikai, let's take off our shoes and use our socks and ice-skate through the house.” So all of a sudden what do you thinks happening? He's skating with me, he's not pounding anymore. He just wants to have fun. The last instruction that all children are born with is for freedom. Options. Opportunities. Here's the trick about freedom. As parents what we want to do is to slowly increase freedom as we teach our children the responsible behaviors to handle the freedom. If we give them more freedom than they can handle, they don't feel safe. If we don't give them enough freedom, they feel oppressed. So our job is to slowly increase freedom as we teach responsible behavior. Part of the challenge with that though, it goes at the heart of the conflict between parent and child. There is an inherent conflict between parent and child that started pre-birth. Every parent I've ever met has the same wish and dream for their child and that is that they want their children to grow up and be happy, healthy, responsible adults who like them enough to come home and visit or let the parents visit them. But, underneath that, they want their children to live, to grow up. And most children, when they're born and young, they're driven by curiosity, creativity, they wanna go out and touch it, taste it, pick it up and smear it on the walls, smear it on your face. They are just itching with fun and freedom. And what happens is when our children get to be a certain age where they're old enough to go out into the world, parents driven by their desire to keep their children close and safe restrict. The ultimate goal behind peaceful parenting is honoring our childrens' desire to go out into the world as we teach them how to do that safely. Parents are trying to manage their own fear for their child by oppressing. So much of the counseling that I do and I believe the counseling that you are involved with is helping parents learn how to self-manage their own fear without doing it by controlling or oppressing their children. The ultimate goal as a parent is to help their children learn to meet their need for safety, love, power, fun and freedom responsibly and respectfully. At the same time, what are you doing to meet your need for safety, love, power, fun and freedom? It's a tough job, this job of parenting. It's the job for which we receive no instructions. The only instruction is how we were parented. Usually people fall in one of two categories; they never wanna parent like their parents did or they wanna do just what their parents did. And if they don't wanna parent like their parent did, they don't know what else to do. I hope that you are able to share these ideas with the folks that you're working with. So I hope I've given you some food for thought, a different perspective to contemplate, and some ideas to help enhance your practice.

THERAPY Talks 

00:13:45
SHANNON DERMER Nancy, thank you so much for that fascinating talk. You have a lot of interesting things I wanna ask you about. I think that as clinicians it's often difficult sometimes to help parents balance that freedom with the responsibility that they want their children to have and the safety they want their children to have. So I thought that was very interesting, the tension you talked about between those. One of the things I wanted to ask you specifically about is you use that word oppress; that sometimes unintentionally we oppress our children. You talked a little bit about how we can do that by doing too harsh. But also can you talk a little bit about what happens when we are actually going the other way. Maybe when we're a little too protective of our children. 

00:14:40
NANCY BUCK It's really a very interesting thing. If you make a list of all the behaviors you would see from a child who has too much freedom, and then you make another list of all the behaviors you would see from a child who does not have enough freedom, they're exactly the same. So you don't know. So the whole idea behind parenting is that it's an art. And if a child is acting out and misbehaving and you've done everything you can and still it doesn't seem to be that you're making any progress, usually I recommend to parents try one or the other. Either restrict a little bit more. If things get worse, oops, wrong one. Or give your child a little bit more freedom and see what happens. Now, you gotta be somewhat careful. You can't just give a child carte blanche. Because if it's more freedom than they had then they don't know how to handle it. So you may wanna, actually the recommendation is to ask the parent to ask the child what's one area in your life that you wanna be in charge of, where you want more freedom. And parents are often very frightened of doing that but kids are not unreasonable. They'll say something like, “I wanna choose my own bedtime.” Or “I wanna choose the clothes.” Or “I wanna choose when I do my homework or where.” Great. “So how are you gonna do that?” “Do you need my help in figuring out how to do that?” And “Okay so now let's make the plan and we'll do it for a week and see how it goes.” And in the process of that week what you can, as the parent, do is be a consultant, “How is it going?” “Do you need any more of my help?” rather than the criticizer, “You're not doing it, I thought you said...” Just ask how they're doing and ”Do you think you're having success?” “Is it going the way you want it to go?” So that you're literally giving a little bit more freedom while you're teaching a little bit more freedom. It's really hard cause we believe in order for our child in order for our child to be successful, a parent says, then I really have to do it for them. So not enough time in 15 minutes but certainly one of the things I talk about is our job as parents before we are any other kind of parent is to be a conscious parent. How often am I doing something for my child? With my child? Or allowing my child to do it alone? And if I'm doing it for my child too often, I need to back off. If I'm allowing my child to do it too often alone, depending on the child age, I need to get more involved. But where is that balance and it's not clear. You can have twins where one needs a little bit more and one needs a little less. You can't do exactly the same thing with each child. So finding that balance. But often parents who are overly doing for, it's really about the parents' fear and that's how they're trying to manage. So a skilled therapist starts talking about that. What is it you're getting from being able to do this for your child? And what are you afraid you won't get or won't happen if you do a little less? But it's truly, parenting is an unsung monumental job that has huge benefits. And it's harder, I think, than almost any other job on the planet. 

00:17:50
SHANNON DERMER Well next to graduate students. I'm just kidding. I totally agree because although there is an instruction manual, that instruction manual is slightly different for each child. But also it sounds, it's also having to balance managing your child with managing yourself with managing your child. So you call that, which I don't think I've actually really heard before, conscious parenting. So it's rather than just parenting and doing things outside your awareness, it's becoming conscious of your choices and how those might be impacting your child. 

00:18:30
NANCY BUCK Absolutely. So for many parents as I said before, what we do as parents is just what was done to us. Is that a good idea? Is it a bad idea? Do I wanna change it? Do I want to keep doing it? You can't make any of those decisions until you're first aware that you're doing it. And so just pay attention. I did it because my mom did it and it might have been a good idea for her but really my mom was not raising me with the technology that people are raising their children today. So you just need to be aware. Are you paying attention? Are you in your moments of watching yourself as a parent? 

00:19:05
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So it sounds like conscious parenting is about realizing what you're trying to get out of the choices that you're making. But also the second part of that was being conscious of am I trying to help my child or am I doing this to manage my own anxieties? 

00:19:20
NANCY BUCK Right. And again that one you usually can't do in the moment. So I say the best that most peaceful parents that you'll find on the planet is a parent who has put the child to bed successfully and they're sleeping through the night. Now you've got a peaceful parent cause they're not being pressured. It's also a great time to do some reflection. What did I do today? What were my moments? This is a new one. What were my moments where I was a brilliant parent? Where I think I just did a fabulous job? And then what were some of the things oops, I wish I could do differently now? If I'm gonna do different, how am I gonna do different? And thinking about it without the pressure of needing to have an answer right now in the moment, but what would I, might I try differently, what could I do differently? And some folks need to have counseling. Some folks need to have coaching. Some folks actually get that counseling and coaching informally from friends or others. One woman I talked to recently said that her mother was the best teacher. She taught her everything not to do. There's more than a few, sadly, more than a few parents who say that. At the same time I said, “So do you know what to do instead?” And she said, “No, but I'm finding my way.” So she's trying. And she's not conscious necessarily of what she's doing but she's very conscious of what her mother did and that she does not want to repeat. 

00:20:35
SHANNON DERMER But unfortunately and you eluded to this in the beginning, sometimes people know exactly what they don't want so they do the polar opposite, which doesn't actually get you any kind of balance. It actually ends up... 

00:20:50
NANCY BUCK There is no such thing as perfect parenting. So even if you choose to be a stay at home mom, that means you didn't choose the other. Is that perfect? Who knows? Or you choose to be a parent who decides that they're gonna send their child to early preschool. And that means you didn't do the other. So there is no perfect in it. What you really need to do is to figure out am I being balanced? Am I meeting my needs and am I also creating an environment so my child can meet his or her needs? 

00:21:20
SHANNON DERMER I think that's important to remember that there is no such thing as a perfect parent. And I forgot the term. It was from my microeconomics at freshman year in college, so it was a long time ago. But they talked about the cost of whatever choice you make, there's always a cost for not choosing the other. And that cost exists no matter what because you can't choose all things. So there's always a cost for choice and that's part of what you have to remember is there is no perfect choice. But we can make the best of it that we can by being conscious about it in some ways. One of the other things that you mentioned that I liked was taking time not just to reflect on what you could have done differently, but taking time to reflect on what you did brilliantly. 

00:22:00
NANCY BUCK  Yes, yes. 

00:22:05
SHANNON DERMER So do you coach your clients to focus on their brilliance? 

00:22:10
NANCY BUCK Well first I started by coaching me. What did I do well? What am I pleased about what I did? But part of the way our brain is set up, our brain is set up to pay attention to the mismatches and not pay attention to the matches. So we have to go out of our way to pay attention to the moments of brilliance. If, some people say yeah well about the, well I get so full of myself that I'll never notice my mistakes. No. That's biologically built in. You'll always notice your mistakes. But taking the time to pat yourself on the back and say, “Yeah, here's a moment where I did it well. And can I expand on that? Can I do more of that tomorrow? I loved it. Well my child complained and I turned that into a dance and a song rather than getting caught up in the actual emotion of what was going on for my child. Can I shift so I'm in a better emotional place? And now we can talk about whatever the upset is that's going on for my child.” I'll just tell you one story. It's not quite related but it was just the best thing. I was walking, I was food shopping at a grocery store. And here was a mother with one child on her side and another who was in the carriage. And all of a sudden they would stop because the little girl would say, “Now. Now.” She'd take the other child out and they would dance and sing whatever song. You know the music that's playing? They would just stop and dance. And then they'd go and they'd, this was how they went grocery shopping. I say if you wanna notice parenting practices in your community, go to the grocery store any day of the week but mostly between four and seven when everybody's blood sugar is terrible. And nobody has patience or tolerance. And wouldn't it be fabulous to walk in and say “Dance and song break!” instead. That would be a very different experience than dragging children through the grocery store whining and carrying on. And the parent really wants to whine and carry on too. 

00:24:05
SHANNON DERMER Yeah, I think all social research should be done in the grocery stores. I was a cashier when I was in high school, I saw every kind of parenting technique. Good, bad, everything in between. But I don't remember seeing people dancing in the aisles. I like that. One of your themes to be and partially because you talk about Doctor Glasser, saying how important it is is playfulness. Do parents have a hard time understanding that you can obviously teach through discipline and being serious, but that you can also teach how to be a good responsible person through play? 

00:24:40
NANCY BUCK Absolutely. The, play has a bad rap because we think it's childish. We think it's what children do. Therefore it's frivolous. Children who are playing are doing serious work. And that is how they learn. And in fact if adults take a minute, the things they learn the best is when they're playing. Now it doesn't necessarily mean you're always telling jokes and laughing ha ha ha. But it's the thing that really concentrated on. Gardening is one. I know some people who are unbelievable gardeners. I'm not one. I'm the appreciator of it. But it's work. For me, who does gardening, that's work. For them, I can't wait to play in the garden. For them it's play. So I do make a big deal about it for a variety of reasons. One is because discovering that was a wonderful revelation for me, as well, that I could still play as an adult. It's not something I had to give up because it was childish. And it really is important, serious work that children are doing when they play. Watch. Just watch. They're just relentless in all that they're learning. And the amount of stuff, it's not a very hifalutin word, but the amount of stuff children learn in such a brief period of time. Here's a thought. If we played more maybe we can continue to learn that much in a brief period of time. I don't think so. But why not try? And certainly it bonds relationships as well. People who play together stay together. 

00:26:15
SHANNON DERMER It's true. 

00:26:20
NANCY BUCK So it helps with family relations all the way around. 

00:26:20
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. Now I've a colleague, we often talk, she's a play therapist. But we often talk about how those same principles and the same things that play with children are so helpful with are also helpful for couples, for families, for adults that the business of play is actually pretty serious. 

00:26:40
NANCY BUCK It is. It absolutely is. 

00:26:40
SHANNON DERMER We only have a little bit of time left together but I want to ask you a quick question because you made a difference in, my brain is wired to notice differences, that between self esteem and power within. Why do you use the term power within? 

00:26:55
NANCY BUCK Well for me it's consistent with my model that it's power and there's power over, power with and power within. And then the rest of the world uses the term self esteem. So I'm okay with that. I don't not wanna be part of the world. However, there is a fair bit of controversy, what do you do to build a child's self esteem? Nothing. The child has to build their own self esteem. How do they do that? By accomplishing and successfully accomplishing through failure and continual trial whatever it is, the hurdle that they're trying to get over. And when they do they have a huge sense of I got it. I mean I remember that, you probably don't. But when I was first learning computers, the screen would come up and say you've committed... 

00:27:40
SHANNON DERMER  A grievous error. I actually do remember that. The big floppy disk. 

00:27:45
NANCY BUCK  It was an illegal function and I thought oh my gosh am I going to jail? I mean I totally, but then I finally, whatever it was, understood how to use it and succeed at it, I felt great. Then of course the next thing came along and I was equally incompetent. But there's that sense of I feel good about what's going on inside of me. Self esteem is self esteem. 

00:28:10
SHANNON DERMER So you're self advocacy isn't something that we need to give an incentive for. It is it's own reward and it's one of our urges that are built into us to master things. To go out and be creative and master the world. 

00:28:20
NANCY BUCK And in fact, doing that, rewarding on top of, is insulting. 

00:28:25
SHANNON DERMER Okay. Which is I think another important lesson. You have many today so I wanna thank you Doctor Buck for giving us the many important lessons for children but also for ourselves as adults. And if you;re interested in more of Doctor Buck's talks and other therapy talks, please check out the website at Alexander Street Press. Thank you for joining us today. And thank you Doctor Buck.
