RICHARD SIMON My name is Rich Simon, editor of the Psychotherapy Networker, and I'd like to welcome you, and you'd like to welcome me. I'd like to welcome you to the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Networker Symposium. And this year, at no extra charge, I'd also like to take this opportunity to proclaim that this is the thirtieth anniversary of the Networker magazine. Of course, I'm just saying that for the benefit of the few remaining dinosaurs amongst you who still like to take in information from the printed page. We all know who you old-timers are. You like to read your morning newspaper, propped up against a Wheaties box, and then commute to work in a Dodge Dart. Listening to Barry Manilow on your 8-track player. 35 years, now, that's a lot of anniversaries. And, of course, a cause of great thanksgiving, especially for thus, those of us still on the Networker payroll after all these years. So, for the moment, while I still have your attention, before you start checking Facebook and Twittering all your fans, let's briefly contemplate those 35 years. 35 years. I guess, when you consider the origins of homo sapiens 200,000 years or so, give or take a few centuries, or the beginning of life on this planet, 3.7 billion years, or of the Earth itself, 4.5 billion years, three and a half decades doesn't seem that long. But for those of us who've been coming to this conference over, and over, and over again it seems like a long time. In fact, some of us are convinced that if you studied the historical record carefully enough you'd find that when the pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock, there were a few Symposium volunteers in their little red caps, already there, beaming empathically and handing out on-site brochures. 35 years, that's a lot of conferences, and a lot of distinguished visitors from outside our field. Some of them legendary figures from the worlds of literature, politics, the sciences, and the arts. People like John Updike, Maya Angelou, Mario Cuomo. Eli Weisel, Gloria Steinem, Stephen J. Gould. That's not to mention all our more homegrown legends and workshop presenters who became legendary, at least while they're here, or felt legendary after they read the glowing workshop reviews you gave them if they'd been sufficiently edifying, or clinically dazzling. For now, let's not dwell on how some of us felt when we occasionally roused your ire with boring or disappointing sessions. Believe me, I can still feel their pain. You may be a caring and nurturing bunch, but those of us who have felt the lash of your disapproval have learned not to stir up the displeasure of the Symposium attendees. Hell hath no fury like a disappointed psychotherapist. 35 years, that's a lot of coffee and Danish. Not to mention a lifetime's worth, literally, of CE credits. But why do so many of us come back year after year? Is it just because you like to stick those little numbers that we have in the lobby on your badge,

RICHARD SIMON Showing how many years you've been coming? Or because you wouldn't dream of missing the disinhibiting spectacle of our Friday night dance, the long running psychodrama in the history of psychotherapy? The other possibility is that we're all involved in a benign sort of cult, with its own rituals, its own saints, sinners, prophets, and even an occasional holy fool. I guess, for some people, each Spring the Omni Shoreham becomes the holy shrine of the shrink. And depending on your attachment history or preference for transference objects, that would make me either a kind of temporary high priest, or the world's oldest Bar Mitzvah boy. I think you're voting what, which one you prefer. All these years, the enduring appeal of this conference is clear. Sure, it's a fun party and a highly efficient one-stop CE shopping expedition, but that's not all. The truth is that when you get right down to it every Symposium is an investigation into the issues and human qualities central to every therapist and every therapeutic encounter. If you try to irreducible core of why most of us are here, it has to do, I think, with our endless fascination with that mysterious, indefinable, but utterly indispensable quality of any good therapist: wisdom. Yes, wisdom, whatever that is. Like those Justices in that famous Supreme Court case, we may have trouble defining it precisely, but we know it when we see it and hear it. Wisdom is undoubtedly helpful in just about any line of work or way of life, but in what other profession is wisdom the single most important quality to have? After all, where do people generally go when they need somebody who can help them negotiate the messiest, most excruciating, most difficult passages of life? Deep in the throes of rape, loss, pain, feeling as low, miserable, and unworthy as is possible to humans to feel. Who are you going to consult, an investment banker, a politician, a corporate executive, your dentist, or however much we may adore them, Brad Pitt, Lady Gaga, or even Jeremy Lin? Let's face it, in our secular age, the traditional wisdom dispensers, priests, ministers, rabbis, they just don't have the caseloads they once did. And unlike our competitors with our latest exploration of the brain and the connection among mind, body, and spirit, we seem to be alone in adding to the store of human wisdom, rather than holding on for dear life to the certainties of the past. In fact, as the research seems to increasingly be telling us, it's not our methods but ourselves that is the primary active ingredient in the consulting room. Clinical wisdom is seeming more and more like the absolute sine qua non of competent practice. Compared to that, nothing else; no acquired skill, no theoretical belief system, no exalted professional credential matters. But the question before us over the next few days is, what is wisdom, and where does it come from, and how do we get it? Is it inborn, like the ability to hit a perfect high C note or something you gradually pick up with time and practice, like doing your multiplication tables, or shooting free throws, or subscribing to the Psychotherapy Networker. Will you get it if you spend a year or 10 in a monastery? Can you buy it as an iPhone app? When we first began having this conference, and publishing the Networker magazine many, many decades ago, we thought we knew for sure where you could find wisdom. It resided, like hair color or tone of voice, within certain people. It's part of their character, their very being. A wise person was Obi Wan Kenobi in Star Wars, or Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird. Fictional characters like these leave such an impression because we so want there to pe-, people like that in the world. Calm, saintly, infinitely compassionate figures who will help us know what we should do in life, and never let us down. It may be a very childish fantasy, but it's a universal one. It's not an accident that our field ascribed the same quality of super human wisdom to many of the great old masters of psychotherapy; Freud, Jung, Rogers, Sullivan. And, of course, the less we actually knew about them, the deeper that ascribed wisdom. But then, a bunch of charismatic iconoclasts inspired lots of us to knock those old gods off their pedestals, and replace them with the new gods of family therapy. In the 70s and 80s we knew for a fact that the founders of family therapy, Whitaker, Satir, Bowen, Minuchin, had wisdom in spades. They exemplified wisdom from their very being. They emanated wisdom from their pores, leaving a kind of luminous glow around their persons. Or at least, that's how it felt to many of us back then. We knew that they were wise, well, because they knew they were wise. Everything they said exuded confidence, assurance, certitude. They, and we, believed that their clinical wisdom could transform history; reconstitute families, cure schizophrenia, end poverty. We loved their pithy pronouncements. The more gnomic and elusive, the better. One famous family therapist liked to periodically announce wet birds fly at night. When ever he did, inevitably, his students would puzzle and buzz about what grand key to fundamental knowledge was encapsulated in this mysterious little nugget. This year, we will award bonus CEs to anybody who can finally figure it out. Well, part of growing up is sooner or later being disappointed in those same gods we set up in the first place. Discovering that our iconic heroes are merely human after all, just like us. And, in this Presidential election year. I think I say, need say no more about that. So, should we then be disillusioned with the possibility of wisdom? Disillusioned with our heroes for not having enough of it? Of course not. The problem isn't with wisdom, but where we have always looked for it. In these highly individualistic United States of America, we have assumed that wisdom is a kind magic substance people carrying around inside them. Maybe in little wisdom packets loqua-, located somewhere in the vicinity of the spleen. Or, in the more fashionable parlance of the moment, among the neural circuits of the anterior cingulate gyrus, or the medulla oblongata. And you can quote me on that. No, the truth is, and maybe we're just beginning to guess this, the best way to approach the great mystery of human wisdom is to recognize that wisdom resides in the community. Especially in a certain kind of generative community conversation that brings out the best in everyone participating in it. For our species, with all of our miraculous talents, as well as our many lamentable blind spots and Stone Age emotional reflexes, genuine wisdom is best considered a collective project in which we gradually achieve most of whatever limited wisdom we have through, and with, and from other people. I've often had this thought that all we really yearn for in life is something like wall to wall wisdom. A flawless intricately patterned carpet of wisdom. Think antique Persian silk, extending through our lives, manifesting in every particular. We don't yell at our spouses or our kids, or anybody else. We don't seethe with anger and resentment. We don't experience envy and greed. We always feel genuinely loving and kindness for all creatures. We are fonts of sound judgment, selfless generosity, fine discernment, farsighted wisdom, and penetrating insight. Besides all that, we have a great sense of humor. But as we get older many of us come to realize we are very lucky if, rather than wall to wall wisdom, we have even a small doormat. Or even a stained placemat. Or, for that matter, even a gummy postage stamped sized pad of true wisdom. But fortunately, even the humblest, most misguided of us usually have our little wisdom patches of various sizes, shapes, and colors ranging across different subjects and different areas of life. Most of the time they are big enough to sustain us through restricted regions of life. As long as we don't try to step very, out, far outside our customary boundaries. The problem is, it can get a little boring, and even claustrophobic, staying within those narrow boundaries. Nor are we of much help to anybody else if we're only focused on balancing precariously at our own little placemat. But if we could somehow find a way to step from mat, to mat, to rug, or even combine all these different floor coverings, we could actually traverse the floor of life without getting our feet cold, and dirty, and chewed up with all the sharp and nasty pebbles and glass shards along the way. But creating this combination wisdom rug is a collective enterprise, and the product is rarely neat and tidy. In fact, it looks a lot like the oddball crazy quilt of throw rugs, placemats, and yes postage stamps, you know who you are, that I am looking at right now. I think it is no accident that we are all her at a conference that isn't sponsored by a group of experts and specialists. After all, this is the annual gathering of the Psychotherapy Networker. And you can be sure there are no geniuses or Old Testament prophets in our offices. In fact, you could say we, at the Networker, specialize in being experts in not being expert. Our true specialty is ignorance. Albeit ignorance seasoned with what we like to think of as a healthy dose of curiosity and an openness to learning. In each issue of our magazine, when we're trying to assemble this crazy quilt of a conference each year, we go forth, armed not so much with great knowledge or deep wisdom, but with curious minds. A willingness to ask questions, even questions that sound dumb and a real desire to hear the answers. In fact, trying to get at least temporary partial answers to those questions; what is psychotherapy, what are we learning about it, how can we make it more effective is why we put on the Symposium each year. So, in a way, every Symposium is like every other Symposium, and, really, that's its glory. The Symposium is, after all, as so many of us know, the same old community engaged in the same old conversation in search of the same old wisdom. Always the same, and always different. I know that this year I have been just as excited and pumped as I was last year, and the year before that, and all the years before that going back to that first tiny gathering that Networker founder Chuck Simpkinson convened at the Interfaith Chapel in Columbia, Maryland 35 years ago.

RICHARD SIMON So, no matter how many years I've been part of putting out the Networker magazine, or organizing this conference, I keep feeling like I'm doing it for the very first time. And my guess is that a lot of you feel the same way about your work. Well, okay, on a good day. And I hope, like me, you look forward to this opportunity for all of us to lay out our various little wisdom rugs, or mats, or postage stamps with all their quirks, and gaps, and threadbare patches. And as they draw together and overlap in this great wisdom bizarre over these next few days, I look forward to joining with you on the closest thing to a magic carpet ride that the field of psychotherapy has to offer. But before we proceed on our journey to collective wisdom, it's finally good, finally time to make good on our conference's title and its promise, the part about optimal well-being. I'm well aware, uh, listening to my annual soliloquizing isn't going to get us there. So, we have enlisted some expert help in offering you this scientifically tested, empirically supported opener to launch the thirty-fifth anniversary gathering of the Psychotherapy Networker Symposium.

RICHARD SIMON There's no business like show business. Okay, so, at times like this, when you have to shift the mood, there's no instant group tranquilizer quite like announcements. 

00:37:50

00:37:55
RICHARD SIMON So, what we have here is, um, a few announcements. We have, and we want to remind you it will be very brief. The on-site shou-, brochure gives you all the information you need. This conference, I, I hope we've established, is about participation, about conversation, and we have a new vehicle for doing that, a digital vehicle. It's called Symposium Live. Not only the keynoters and the presenters get to address the entire assemblage, but all of you. Go up to the Networker website, www.psychotherapynetworker.org. You will be able to go up to the site and blog and comment to your heart's content. Um, we are, a, a very important theme of this meeting is community, and community is a practice. We're very fortunate that we have, uh, two of the leading practitioners and theorists of Communities of Practice, Etienne Wenger and Beverly Trayner. And so, if you wanna extend the conversation, hook up with other folks at the conference, learn ways of creating a knowledge community, a learning community, yourself, look in your on-site brochure. You'll see during lunchtime and at the end of the day, Etienne and Beverly will be available. The bookstore, uh, and the exhibit hall, it is our town square. It is a magnificent creation. A Brigadoon out of the, full blown out of the imagination of Mike McKenna. There are book signings at lunchtime. Our keynote speaker this morning will be available for a limited time for book signings, so get down there early, uh, you'll be able to see him. Uh, just, uh, a quick reminder, this evening, uh, there are a number of fun events. We have our, our psychotherapy comic, Howard Richmond, look in the brochure. He has some fans already, fabulous. There's a very moving, uh, documentary on Vietnam vets, and the, the challenges of returning home. It's called The Welcome. Bill McMillan, who's one of the filmmakers, and others will be there to comment on that. And, of course, the Friday night dance. So, if you are envying those of us who got to be up on this stage just a few moments ago, your chance will come, 9:00 tonight.
