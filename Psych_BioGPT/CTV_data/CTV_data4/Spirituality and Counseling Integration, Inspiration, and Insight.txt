Spirituality and Counseling: 

00:00:20
Integration, Inspiration, and Insights 

00:00:30
With Dr. Sam Gladding and Dr. Geri Miller 

00:00:35
SAM GLADDING Hello, I’m Dr. Sam Gladding, a professor of counseling at Wake Forest University. 

00:00:40
GERI MILLER And I am Dr. Geri Miller, a professor of counseling in Appalachian State University. 

00:00:45
SAM GLADDING This video is on spirituality and counseling, a subject that many counselors are concerned about but one that a number of counselors feel awkward about. In this film, we hope to explain how spirituality and counseling fit together, and how it is important not to ignore spirituality in counseling relationships. 

00:01:15
GERI MILLER Some of the most prominent counselors in the history of the profession have been concerned with spirituality and its relevance in counseling. And two of the most prominent of these professionals were Viktor Frankl and Rollo May. Viktor Frankl, who survived internment in a number of Nazi concentration camps in World War-II wrote and spoke extensively on how his own spirituality gave him a will to meaning and helped him survive the horrors of his situation. And Rollo May, who survived tuberculosis as a young man also spoke and wrote about the importance of spirituality in his life and how anxiety can be empowering rather than debilitating. Both men were advocates of exploring the spiritual side of life with their claims. 

00:02:05
Definitions 

00:02:10
SAM GLADDING The term counseling has been bantered about like a badminton birdie for years. However, thanks to the 20-20, futures of counseling initiative, 30 major counseling associations have agreed on a definition. This definition can be found on many websites like those of the American Counseling Association, thus an agreed upon definition is " Counseling is a professional relationship that empowers diverse individuals, families, and groups to mental health, wellness, education, and career goals. It involves the application of cognitive, affective, behavioral, and systemic interventions." This definition is more indirect than direct about the place of spirituality and counseling. However, most mental health professionals consider spirituality as a part of wellness that could be conceptualized as either a wheel or a piece of a pie. In looking at the pie figure, notice that spirituality is as important as mental, emotional, physical, social, and environmental factors in the well-being of persons, that leads us to defining spirituality. 

00:03:35
GERI MILLER And like counseling, the term spirituality has been defined in a number of ways, however one of the best definitions has been crafted by the Association for Spiritual, Ethical, and Religious Values in Counseling or ASERVIC. And the ASERVIC definition is that spirituality is a search for transcendent meaning or the belief in some sort of greater existence outside of humankind. It can be linked to religion, but the practice of spirituality is generally considered to go beyond religion and links individuals with something larger, such as the universe itself. And research suggests that a counselor’s inclusion of an individual’s spiritual beliefs may assist in therapy and in the process of healing. Thus spirituality is an entity unto itself. It’s a part of the fabric of who we are as human beings, it connects us to the larger universe. And spirituality lifts us beyond the mundane and links us with the transcendent nature of life. 

00:04:45
Why is spirituality important in life? 

00:04:50
SAM GLADDING Geri, while we talk about the transcendent nature of spirituality, it’s important to delve deeper than that I think, and talk about specifics regarding the importance of spirituality in individual lives. I’ve mentioned the wheel or the pie chart of wellness as one reason spirituality is a vital component of people’s lives. I also think of spirituality as a factor in understanding clients better, especially if that part of their personality is well developed. In addition, I think of the role spirituality plays in addiction recovery. When those who have been addicted or had addiction problems, turn over control of their lives to a higher power, that’s a rendering of self to something greater than oneself, seems to work for many of them, and seems to not only give them peace, but purposefulness. How do you see spirituality as an important component of life? 

00:05:55
GERI MILLER I think, spirituality can be conceptualized as several questions that help a counselor and a client explore the client’s story more thoroughly. And these simple but essential questions that I will often ask clients are "What keeps your spirit alive? " Framed in people places and activities, " What gets you out of bed?" Once again in terms of people, places, and activities, and thirdly, "What gives you hope?" And again as I stated in terms of people, places, and activities, so I think, by asking these questions we not only obtain information but we get to the heart of the values that the clients hold. So an example is that of a depressed client reading the Bible, reading is the action, but the values are those connected with hope and inspiration. And then in addition to these questions, I think integrating spirituality in counseling is welcoming to most people, because it expands the horizons of what counselors and clients can and will talk about. It invites hope and resilience which are tied to the spiritual side of life. So spiritual issues are integrated into other issues too, Intrapersonal Issues that, for example maybe around abuse issues or addiction issues. Interpersonal issues, where it may be focused on areas such as domestic violence or family system struggles. And thirdly societal issues uh… that may incorporate things like homelessness or unemployment, human rights, and social justice. Finally, spirituality can help clients change, function better, develop a sense of themselves, and maturity. And it can help them with their potential in that… that it can help them make sense out of their existence. 

00:08:00
What part has spirituality played in your life? 

00:08:00
SAM GLADDING Since we like many counselors, your spirituality is one component of our counseling. I think it’s important to not only stress, talking about spirituality uh… as it relates to counseling in general. But how spirituality has played a role in our lives as well? 

00:08:20
GERI MILLER Yeah, as a child, umm… spirituality provided me with a foundation for living. And I was uh… raised in Parochial School so for nine years in my life. Those values were a foundation for what I use in living now. For example, uh… students who were more advanced on a topic needed to help students who were struggling more. When it might not be a topic as much as it was an area like students who could read better, help students who struggle in reading. As an adult, spirituality provides me with guidelines around social justice stands that I take personally and professionally. And again an example here is I have a deep commitment to standing with oppressed individuals. 

00:09:10
Samuel Templeman 

00:09:15
SAM GLADDING Umm… As a child spirituality was inspirational to me in deciding what I wanted to do with my life. I’m out of my life after the man I was named for Samuel Templeman. One of the first stories I heard about him was his stopping at lynching in a small South Carolina town. Granted he was a Baptist minister, but his actions which put his family in danger, came not just from his religious side but from his spiritual side as well. In the realization that all of us share a commonality as human beings and that life is sacred in the broadest sense of that word. So his spiritual side informed me and inspired me to treat all life with respect and reverence. As an adult, I’ve realized the importance of spirituality on a number of occasions. A particular instance that stands out in my mind is when I suffered a broken engagement in my 20s, I was distraught. And I wondered how I was going to go on. Then, one night, I dreamed that I was in a desert, crawling, lacking substance, and close to giving up. Just then four of my ancestors suddenly showed up, and I heard my grandfather Templeman say, "We will carry you until you can make it on your own." Then they picked me up and with that I woke up, realizing, I was going to be okay in the long run. 

00:11:00
What is negative spirituality? 

00:11:05
GERI MILLER We have been talking about the positive aspects of spirituality, but there are negative ones as well. And we need to be aware of them and make sure that what we do in the spiritual realm is healthy. 

00:11:15
Dag Hammarskjold 

00:11:15
Albert Schweitzer 

00:11:15
SAM GLADDING A good way to discern if spirituality in someone’s life is healthy is to determine if it’s love based or fear based. For example, I had a client one time who wanted to talk about the spiritual part of his life. But when he did, he literally started shaking and started talking about his fear of going to hell. I recognize that part of his situation was embracing a view of spirituality that was full of demons. And that was just plain scary, thus I worked with my client to try to show him other world views of what a spiritual person might look like. My examples for him uh… were to read and for us to talk about the lives of Dag Hammarskjold and Albert Schweitzer, both of whom were spiritual but in different ways. 

00:12:15
Martin Buber 

00:12:15
GERI MILLER A second way to tell if spirituality is negative or not, is to focus on whether it decreases or increases our perception of the humanness of people. The existentialist philosopher Martin Buber centered much of his work on how individuals engage with other individuals. And there’s a major difference between I thou relationship and I it relationships. A person is at all times engaged in the world in one of these modes. An I thou perspective is a relationship that stresses the mutual holistic existence of two beings. An I it perspective is a barrier to a deeper relationship and community. And it treats people as objects, resulting in maladies as sexism, racism, and homophobia. And thus it is important to explore with clients their perception of people in the world. 

00:13:15
How do we cultivate spirituality? 

00:13:20
GERI MILLER Spirituality is like other aspects of life than enriches. It has to be cultivated and encouraged. And I like to think of spirituality as being like a plant that’s either growing or dying. And to keep a plant alive and growing, it has to be tended to in a caring and concentrated way. And if it’s neglected, the plant withers. It’s what we do in regard to our spirituality that makes a difference. For instance, there are techniques that invite hope, and resilience, and reflection. 

00:13:55
Spiritual Genogram 

00:13:55
SAM GLADDING One such technique is a Spiritual Genogram. It informs the client even one who may be an atheist about his or her values and helps clients recognize family patterns transmitted across generations. It follows a typical genogram pattern. Besides doing a Spiritual Genogram, counselors can also help clients connect with their spirituality through the use of Bibliotherapy, especially reading about the lives of others who were initially either spiritual like St. Teresa or who were not like Augustine and the Buddah. Music is a third way of getting in touch with one spirituality from the Gregorian chants of the Middle Ages to the Sufi music of Turkey. A fourth way of assessing who one is spiritually is through journaling, writing out one’s thoughts, give them a presence in life that is not possible otherwise, being able to see and read what you are thinking can make a major difference in the way that you think. 

00:15:10
GERI MILLER Using a Higher Power Jar can also be helpful. And a higher power jar is a container that can be a jar or a box uh… that one puts in where the client would put in something that they’re worried about, and then symbolically that’s letting go of that worry to a higher power. So that when they uh… go through their day, they can reassure themselves, " I don’t have to worry about that my higher power is taking care of it." Play and Humor is a sixth way of gauging one’s spirituality and encouraging it uh… Play and Humor are sources of hope and resilience, and so with clients if they can learn to relax in order to play, relax, to have humor in living, they can live with uh… more adaptability and flexibility. And that can sustain them and help them with resilience. So encouraging our clients to play uh… and have a sense of humorat that is fulfilling for them. Not a negative kind that leaves a bad aftertaste but a positive kind, can help them go about in living and sustain their spirit. 

00:16:30
Mindful Meditation 

00:16:30
SAM GLADDING Umm… Finally, Mindful Meditation is a way of focusing on spirituality. It’s a six step process of having persons concentrate on what is happening within themselves, that is body awareness and thoughts. The first step is to find a comfortable place to sit, and a posture where you were both alert and relaxed. The step two is closing your eyes and letting your body relax. The third step is to notice the sensations in your body, areas that are either cool or areas that are warm. The fourth step consists of picking a sensation such as breathing and paying attention to it such as breathing in and breathing out. In the fifth step, you find that when your mind wanders, you bring it back to following the sensations, you’re noticing such as breathing and staying in the present. Finally, after a few minutes, you open your eyes and go on your way. Many people find group experiences such as yoga as a good way of practicing mindful meditation on a physical, mental, and spiritual level. 

00:18:05
Views on Spirituality Part One: An Interview with Dr. Bob Nations 

00:18:10
SAM GLADDING I’m here with Dr. Bob Nations, who is a faculty member at the Wake Forest University Department of Counseling, who is an ordained United Methodist minister, and who is a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist. And we’re talking about spirituality from his perspective today. So, I’d like to ask you kind of a series of four questions. 

00:18:35
BOB NATIONS Sure. 

00:18:40
SAM GLADDING Okay. The first one is this, kind of a two-part question. In general, what meaning does spirituality have for you and how do you see spirituality in your life and the lives of others? 

00:18:55
BOB NATIONS I think of spirituality is a significant aspect of who I am. Uh… Certainly, it’s a part of my identity that I bring to counseling, that I bring as a clergy person. Umm… It’s a… it’s a way that I see myself finding meaning and purpose in the world, it’s a lens out of mini lens that I look through but a primary lens. Uh… That… that helps me understand that there’s at times a purpose, uh… higher than I am when I get involved with groups and counseling, there seems to be something that is very significant going on. It’s… It’s a way that I think of at times that enables me to become fully human, whole, and complete as possible with uh… myself and working with others. And also I have that expectation with other people as well. I think… I think there’s two parts of that for myself and also for others as I say spirituality work itself out. One is that it’s a… a internal process. It’s one that creates a sense of self reflection. Who am I as a person, that considers themselves spiritual. What does that mean as I begin to do some self-reflection? And it helps me in umm… even in my own spiritual practices, I do contemplative meditation primarily. But and out of that I have a sense of… of connection to something that it’s more powerful than me at times. And I find meaning and purpose in that, I find some ways to discern some questions that I’m dealing with it’s a… it’s a… it’s… it’s a way that I experience some calmness and connection, compassion in my life, so those are all kind of values of what spirituality is about. The other part to uh… Dr. Gladdening is that it’s a… it’s worked itself out in externally as well. It’s… it’s a way that creates some transformation in the world to… to create umm… uh… a way of transcendence. I see that in people’s lives and in mine too. As… as we see ourselves connected with others, and as we have some uh… values and meaning and purpose that spirituality would drive us to be compassionate people, to be caring people, to be people of service to uh… humankind, so that’s a… that’s a big part what it’s about. The last part about that I think of it is uh… spirituality creates for me and in others a sense of awe and wonder. So whenever I have these kinds of experiences of awe and wonder, and sometimes it can be something umm… as simple as being in nature, I went to Glacier National Park. I went to see the Grand Canyon and to stand there in awe and wonder just say "I am part of this." Part of this, this Earth that has a sense of beauty in connection and that was for me, a spiritual experience. 

00:21:50
SAM GLADDING Mm-hmm. Okay, let me ask you a second question. Umm… What issues in spirituality have helped you umm… uh… address things in counseling, suggests issues in counseling? 

00:22:00
BOB NATIONS In my experience, one of the primary issues is Grief and Loss where folks would come and talk about significant losses in their lives, that could be losses of… of… of umm… meaning and purpose, loss of a job uh… loss of an expectation and a hope and spirituality for folks who can encounter that and see that as part of this. I had a sense that there’s some purpose and meaning in that. Sometimes there’s also umm… the issues in counseling also would be that. I try to assess is their spirituality a source of support for them or is it a source of conflict. In folks that see this is a source of support will have a way of making meaning around this loss. And certainly around the issues of… of death and dying, losing a loved one, uh… how can my life go on, where, will I see them again, such things of that kind of loss of that significant other in connection and spirituality is a way once again the folks find purpose and meaning in that. They have some uh… if they’re part of a religious community, sometimes they’re thinking about how this has a meaning of being connected later on, about eternal life, of that kind of connection beyond the grave, and will I see my loved one again, and so spirituality sometimes can have meaning around there. Spirituality is a part of this, how they can continue to go on living find meaning in life after losing and after grieving loss. 

00:23:30
SAM GLADDING Sure. 

00:23:30
BOB NATIONS So, that’s the significance what I’ve seen through the years. Umm… The other is Relationship Counseling. I’m working with relationships, particularly couples will come in and uh… one of the fun things I do, I seem to be spending some time now with pre-married couples. And part with working with pre-married couples, one of the questions that I will ask, uh… if they are umm… spiritual, and spirituality part of what’s going to happen as they develop their relationship. So that invites some conversations around that to see if it’s compatible uh… and if that’s going to be a source of support for them. Uh… Couples come in at times, at stages of conflict, and I find out, are they at a place where they’re going to uh… make this marriage work, are they motivating committed to do that. And spirituality can be part of that once again if that’s something that’s a source of support because they’ll say "We made a pledge. We made a promise to be together." And that’s a value. And it’s gonna elevate beyond the conflict. And when they can start making umm… these values more significant than the conflict, they can attach themselves to that and make it work uh… at times. I also say as a source within couples who are uh… have come in a little too late, and they’re not placed where they’re really committed to work on that, and it’ll be a source where they’ll… they’ll continue to find meaning of this and… and try to share with umm… their partner that we made a commitment, we made a commitment for God, or this is something that’s valuable, value that we have about, our attachment and relationships, so that’s a significant area. Third one I think of is umm… uh… Forgiveness and Acceptance. There are a lot of folks that come in. And they’re having a real difficult time umm… forgiving someone, dealing with the hurt and the anger, or maybe they’ve done something themselves and feel they need to forgive themselves. 

00:25:20
SAM GLADDING Sure. 

00:25:25
BOB NATIONS And spirituality is always a part of how I think about that because some folks will have very significant umm… meanings related to their own spiritual or religious culture in the way that they say, uh… I know I’ve got to forgive because this is part of what I believe. So to help them work on forgiveness has been something that’s been part of the spiritual things. The other thing umm… I see being presented for counseling to will be folks that will come in, and I am not an addictions counselor, but I’m a proponent supporter of Twelve-Step programs. So folks who come in and will recognize that umm… some abuse or substance use will be a significant factor in creating unhealthy relationships or a problem that they have. And so to know that… that the spirituality of the 12-step model is a powerful model, so understanding that, and making that kind of referral or adjunct to what we’re doing. 

00:26:20
SAM GLADDING Sure. 

00:26:20
BOB NATIONS In a relationship counseling, significant. 

00:26:25
SAM GLADDING Wow! 

00:26:25
BOB NATIONS So there’s the four years. 

00:26:25
SAM GLADDING Let me ask your third question, which spiritually focused techniques have you used in counseling that assisted you in addressing important issues? 

00:26:35
BOB NATIONS Umm… This is not a technique. But one of the first things I find out is through either an intake umm… conversation or the initial session, I’ll find out if spirituality is part of what they would like to address. If it’s not a presenting problem… 

00:26:55
SAM GLADDING Mm-hmm. 

00:26:55
BOB NATIONS …certainly if it’s a presenting problem, that’s what we’ll address. 

00:26:55
SAM GLADDING Sure. 

00:27:00
BOB NATIONS Umm… I always have some questions related to that is the spirituality is part of what they would like to see happen as a result of the counseling relationship. And if they say yes, then I’ll pursue that a little bit more to find out, you know, who it is with them, is that what’s gonna source the support or source the conflict. 

00:27:15
SAM GLADDING Sure. 

00:27:20
BOB NATIONS Umm… And still certainly say… stay attuned to the… the presenting issues that they… the person or… or the couple, or family is presenting, so that’ll be part of that. If it is a significant issue or one that they want to pursue, I… I use a technique of a Religious Assessment. 

00:27:30
SAM GLADDING Mm-hmm. 

00:27:35
BOB NATIONS So in… in inventory or religious assess, I mean it’s a very important part of my work as well. Uh… I like Journaling, I like folks to take uh… to do some journaling outside of the sessions that will be related to… to the spiritual issues. And once again they may not even call them spirituality, it may be a value, and meaning, and purpose in their life. But I might say journal when you… you experience that this week or what did you do that made that happen, so that may be a… a technique that I will use. 

00:28:00
SAM GLADDING Mm-hmm. 

00:28:00
BOB NATIONS Umm… Also I really enjoy some Dreamwork with couples, and with individuals, and folks that do some journaling as well. So… so dream work may be part of what we do umm… there. Umm… I try to pay attention to the umm… culture that a person comes through the religious spiritual culture and the multi-ethnic culture that they bring to that. And sometimes I’ll use umm… uh… some uh… practices or rituals that’ll be congruent with the client’s belief in that way. So that’s… that will be some techniques, and that’ll be uh… unique to the client, or unique to their… their culture, or their religious belief. If we want to do that, umm… and that usually comes around compassion and forgiveness for self or for others, it seems to be at times uh… mindfulness uh… to practices to look at spiritual practices. And mindfulness is a technique that I used quite a bit in session and also as a practice to recommend for them as well. Umm… If I find out that they have uh… some practices like prayer or worship and the connection with others in that area, that would be something for them to be able to umm… connect with and find out ways that they can continue with that. Sometimes Altruism comes up, folks want to find meaning, and purpose in giving, and so we look at areas of service. So I… I think of these as techniques, but they’re more of an assessment and recommendation a… a… a really important and meaningful technique I found out has been uh… uh… Cinematherapy and Bibliotherapy. Folks will have some movies that I could recommend or that they’ve seen that’s talked about spirituality in their lives. And once again they don’t have to be religious. It could be just fine, something has meaning and purpose in their life and come back and to talk about that and really see that. And that could be an important intervention and technique to use with somebody as well. Uh… The other thing is to use a Spiritual Genogram. 

00:29:55
SAM GLADDING Mm-hmm. 

00:30:00
BOB NATIONS Particularly folks wanna find out, "Well, where does this come from? Where does this meaning and purpose come from? Where does this religious focus come from? Where this drive come from?" And some will do a Spiritual Genogram. And they can trace it back to family of origin who influenced them the most, or who was their spiritual model, or the… the person that they seemed to be attached to in a way uh… that gave them… them uh… a sense of being and purpose in life. So spiritual genogram is an important one, and the other one I… I look at is for umm… scripture or holy writings that come from a person that… that may be a person of faith and asked them to tell me stories. Stories of a religious person, or a religious story, or a spiritual story, uh… of which they relate to or seems to match with where they are and to be able to talk about what happened, how did that person manage that, what occurred there, so those are… those are some techniques I’m fond of. 

00:30:50
SAM GLADDING Sure… sure. Well, one last question. 

00:30:50
BOB NATIONS Sure. 

00:30:55
SAM GLADDING And… and that is uh… what recommendations would you make for counselors who want to engage spiritually uh… or spirituality in counseling? 

00:31:05
BOB NATIONS Umm… I think the first thing is to develop a sense of your own Self-Awareness around spirituality. What does it mean for you, what uh… do you value in that, are there some trigger spots in your own uh… religious spiritual history, that may create some sense of… of ways that you might uh… view somebody in a negative way. Umm… Are there some beliefs about your own spirituality that uh… seem to have meaning and purpose for you. So it is that kind of self-awareness and evaluation of your own spirituality, to realize that there… there can be a degree of cover. Uh… Look at your comfort level to be able to address to bring up to talk about because rarely are these taught in… in training. Sometimes in… in some of the psychotherapy and psychological training they’re not even addressed or even frowned upon… 

00:31:55
SAM GLADDING Right. 

00:31:55
BOB NATIONS …uh… addressing spirituality at least that’s been history. I see that changing more now which I’m encouraged to see that part. Uh… But to look at your level of comfort to be able to talk about spiritual issues, uh… to be able to talk about from a non-judge… judgmental way to develop a sense of respect and curiosity where your clients may be uh… to have an awareness that there’s a variety of religious spiritual expressions that folks will have. And to find out your level of comfort with some ambiguity in those, or some misunderstanding of those uh… at times. Uh… Really have an understanding of the difference between Spirituality and Religion, Religion can be an issue that gets presented at times that can be more argumentative. in some types of relationships, folks will want to know what do you believe, or you align with where I am. What if you stay from a spiritual standpoint umm… there’s not as a higher risk of getting involved in that kind of conflict if you’re comfortable with that. 

00:32:50
SAM GLADDING Mm-hmm. 

00:32:55
BOB NATIONS Umm… So learn how to talk those languages, uh… the most important thing to… as you move along is to when you want to start using spirituality is to understand your own motivation umm… and purpose, your rationale for wanting to include spirituality in counseling. 

00:33:05
SAM GLADDING Sure. 

00:33:10
BOB NATIONS What motivates you for that, how do you see this is something that’s gonna help you as a clinician? How’s this something that’s gonna help you as a counselor? In such a way that uh… will create value and meaning for uh… your counseling sessions and for your clients as well. Uh… So those are some things that, I think, are really important. 

00:33:25
SAM GLADDING Sure. 

00:33:25
BOB NATIONS And the final thing is just to resource yourself, to find the resources that are available for you that really focus on spirituality in counseling. And there’s some very umm… good work being done right now. There’s some good work that’s being done, so to be able to do that umm… the ACA has a division ASERVICm, so there’s… there’s a subgroup there in our… our division rather within ACA that has some significant things uh… Young and (inaudible) have written a significant book umm… called "Integrating Spirituality and Counseling." And it really lays out the competencies that are needed for us to integrate spirituality and counseling so that’s a significant resource. So to be able to resource it would be the last thing I would offer as well. 

00:34:10
SAM GLADDING Sure. Well, your… your life is rich and full. 

00:34:15
BOB NATIONS I’m enjoying it. 

00:34:15
SAM GLADDING And you certainly uh… have given us a lot to think about in regard to spirituality and counseling so, thank you very, very much. 

00:34:25
BOB NATIONS Thank you. 

00:34:25
Views on Spirituality Part Two: An Interview with Tuesday Feral 

00:34:30
GERI MILLER Well, I am with you, Tuesday Feral, who is a student at Appalachian State University in the Clinical Mental Health Counseling Program of the Department of Human Development and Psychological Counseling. And I thank you for this interview because what we’re going to do is really look at spirituality from a transgender perspective. Both as a transgender client yourself in counseling, and then now as you’ve just finished practicum and are moving in through your internship process uh… counseling primarily transgender clients in the setting that you’re at now. So when I go to the four questions that I’m gonna pose to you around spirituality, my hope is that you’ll feel free to fluctuate uh… between both as a client when you were looking at some of your issues that focused in on being transgender, and then also as a counselor as you’re working with transgender clients. 

00:35:35
TUESDAY FERAL Right. 

00:35:40
GERI MILLER Now, before we start, I wanted to ask you which pronoun do you prefer me to use in talking with you and maybe help me understand why the use of that pronoun. 

00:35:50
TUESDAY FERAL Sure, thank you for asking Dr. Miller. Uh… So the appropriate pronouns for me are they them and theirs. Umm… I identify as a non-binary individual, so basically if gender as we think of it normally, culturally is a binary of male and female. I exist somewhere either in between or outside of that binary, so non-binary, so they them in there such as they are sitting here with me doing an interview. 

00:36:15
GERI MILLER Okay. So they’re sitting here with me doing in the interview. And the importance of a pronoun I’m assuming is that it communicates a respect for what you prefer to be called? 

00:36:30
TUESDAY FERAL Yeah, well, it… it indicates to me that you respect me and perceive me correctly. 

00:36:35
GERI MILLER Okay, yeah, great. And I think that is very important part of counseling what we are comfortable being called and the respect that goes along with that so that’s why I wanted us to get anchored in that before we went to the four questions. Okay, so then as you look at these four questions uh… in yourself in terms of how to respond as I said earlier, my hope is that you feel comfortable going back and forth between when you’re a client and when you’re a counselor from the transgender perspective. Okay? So then in general, what meaning does spirituality have for you and how do you see spirituality in your life and the lives of others? 

00:37:25
TUESDAY FERAL Spirituality is uh… really important part of my life. Umm… I think of it really as both both uh… on both end. So it’s the relationship that I have with myself, umm… especially those parts of myself that maybe are harder to be present with, umm… or harder to access, but also how I locate myself in the universe, right. So what my position is as this one individual person on this spinning ball in space, you know, like so how I relate to myself, and then how I’m connected to the world around me into the universe around me. 

00:38:10
GERI MILLER So spirituality then is like a rudder for you? 

00:38:10
TUESDAY FERAL Mm-hmm. 

00:38:15
GERI MILLER Right? 

00:38:15
TUESDAY FERAL Yeah, and it’s umm… it’s the thing that come back to because the universe is vast, and because I as an individual I’m very complex. There, but there’s something that I can come home to sort of a rudder, or a rock, or a touchstone. 

00:38:30
GERI MILLER Right? 

00:38:30
TUESDAY FERAL Yeah. 

00:38:35
GERI MILLER And then if we stay with that, what issues has spirituality helped to address in counseling? Again, maybe from a client perspective and counselor perspective. 

00:38:45
TUESDAY FERAL Yeah, so as a client, umm… much of the work that I have done has been around knowing myself, right. And being able to make contact with myself and find an authentic expression of self because there’s not a lot of modeling in the world umm… for who I feel authentically. Umm… and so using spirituality as a way to have that conversation with myself and that conversation with the sort of locating myself in the universe as well. Umm… It also for me… because spirituality is something that helps me to access those parts of myself that are less comfortable and maybe harder to love umm… harder, to be present with umm… and have compassion for them. That has been some of the work of forgiveness of compassion, self compassion, umm… and umm… surrender. Yeah, so surrendering to what my place is in the universe. Umm… And it’s something that allows me to relinquish control when things are not within my control, right, That’s the place that I can tap into umm… in order to relinquish control. And then uh… as… as far as seeing clients, as far as in the role of a counselor, umm… certainly self-worth is the thing that comes up a lot particularly with trans people because there are a lot of negative cultural messages, family messages, social messages, umm… messages from institutions such as churches. Umm… And so self-worth umm… does come up a lot umm… identity exploration to learning to trust yourself, right. So for people who are being told that you’re invalid umm… you don’t exist, umm… you’re in abomination, things like that. So learning to trust yourself and learning to be able to trust, your place in the universe too. 

00:41:00
GERI MILLER So whether it’s from a client perspective or a counselor perspective? What I heard is that spirituality is like a bridge uh… both within oneself and with other people to help with self-acceptance, compassion, forgiveness umm… as well as developing a sense of a rightful place in the world. 

00:41:25
TUESDAY FERAL Yeah. 

00:41:30
GERI MILLER Okay, so which spirituality focused techniques have you used in counseling that assisted you in addressing important issues, maybe both from the client perspective and counselor perspective? 

00:41:45
TUESDAY FERAL It’s a good question. Umm… So from the client perspective, something that was really essential for me was examining the doctrines of the belief system that I grew up in and umm… sort of reframing them, and reworking them, and translating them into a positive and umm… life-affirming messages instead of things that were weaponized umm… and used to damage. So sort of really getting into the doctrines and looking at what they say umm… and finding perspectives that were supportive of me. Umm… And I… I would say that that is really important. And so for an example of that, so I was raised in a Christian faith tradition, a very conservative Christian faith tradition. Umm… And so when… umm… when looking at the Christian tradition, I came to a point where I began to conceptualize Old Testament Angry God who was really judgmental and into killing lots of people and that sort of thing, umm… sort of as toxic masculinity, right. And then, along comes Jesus who is definitely gentler, a more social justice oriented, umm… more feminist, right, who comes in as an intercessor, right and so that made those concepts a lot more accessible to me umm… to sort of reframe them umm… in… in that terminology, with things that I can see in the culture around me that are current. Umm… And it helped me really be able to understand umm… the treasures that I was given in my upbringing as far as the framework uh… that I was raised within which didn’t really feel like a treasure at the time, but looked at through another perspective that really did help. Umm… And then also doing expressive arts things like visioning collages, and stuff like that around identity, around connection, around my place in the universe around who I am around, who I want to be around what I’m scared of, what holds me back, you know. So really expressing those things in a way sort of bypassing the cognitive part and just expressing them creatively, and then going back over it and looking at it, right, to get that information out of it is really helpful. I think, also umm… to find faith communities that are affirming, right, and are accepting, and they certainly they exist online. They exist in buildings. Umm… And they are more accessible in some areas of the country than others. But umm… there are thriving communities. There are conferences that are specifically umm… geared towards trans spirituality umm… and so things like that are really helpful. Umm… And also learning about trans history, and finding role models, umm… and people that I could look up to and finding people who had been tackling these questions around spirituality and gender identity, and see, you know, what have they done. Umm… I think that all of those things were really very helpful. Umm… And those are things that I brought into my work with my clients as well. 

00:45:00
GERI MILLER That’s what I was (inaudible). And what I’m hearing run through that is techniques that are self affirming uh… it’s empowering versus uh… techniques and, or perspectives that are dehumanizing for you. So both as a client and then as a counselor, emphasizing those approaches that affirm and power, an individual in themselves again, and then also in community. 

00:45:35
TUESDAY FERAL Yes. 

00:45:40
GERI MILLER Okay. So what recommendations would you make for counselors, then who want to integrate spirituality into their counseling, particularly from a transgender perspective? 

00:45:50
TUESDAY FERAL Yeah, well, because umm… for trans people, for transgender people, often there’s some religious trauma, right. There’s often religious trauma associated with upbringing or even just existing in the world. And so I think that’s a really important thing to understand and acknowledge. Umm… I think for a counselor to interrogate their own gender, and their own umm… relationship of their gender to their spirituality umm… because that’s something that may not have been explored so that would be a really important place to start. But also what do your spiritual and religious beliefs have to say about transgender identities, right. And so being really clear on that umm… and knowing that part of yourself so it won’t leak out umm… in counseling. And I think, first and foremost though that acknowledgement and understanding that there may be some spiritual trauma umm… because unfortunately often umm… religion and spirituality are used as umm… a reason to oppress and marginalize transgender people. Umm… And so the weight of those negative messages can make people really cautious umm… and could be really off-putting. Umm… So a spiritual approach is something that, I think, is very important to umm… to approach gently umm… with a lot of flexibility for what spirituality may look like. Because for me as an individual, umm… the way that I pray is generally by dancing or making art, and someone may not consider that to be a spiritual activity. Umm… So with some flexibility for what that might look like because it might look like putting on amazing outfits, umm… or it might look like going into the woods, or whatever it is so some flexibility in that and a lot of patience and compassion for people’s trauma histories. 

00:47:50
GERI MILLER So if I heard correctly, there are three things I heard. And their general to counseling but I also heard you say turn up the volume of this with a trans person that looking at counter transference as a counselor is really critical uh… looking for possible trauma in relation to religion and spirituality. And then lastly having uh… the room to say uh… what keeps your spirit alive for you as a person and know that that may be very different from one human being to another, from one trans person to another. 

00:48:35
TUESDAY FERAL Yeah, definitely. I mean, it’s not universal. Umm… And I think to… for trans people who umm… spirituality and faith be. Faith is an important part of their lives. Often there’s a real fear around coming out in a faith community. And there’s a real sense of loss. And many times when trans people do come out in their churches, they lose that community. Umm… They’re basically exiled from the community. And so as a counselor knowing what affirming churches are there in the area can be really helpful because you may be able to give them resources umm… so that they can find another community that will uplift and support them. 

00:49:15
GERI MILLER Yes. And even if a counselor doesn’t know those resources making a commitment to the client to go on the journey and discover them together. 

00:49:25
TUESDAY FERAL Yes. 

00:49:25
GERI MILLER Well, thanks so much for being willing to be interviewed. I appreciate it. 

00:49:30
TUESDAY FERAL Yeah, thank you for having me, Dr. Miller.

SAM GLADDING We hope this video has given you some information and insights on the relationship of spirituality and counseling. As we have discussed, spirituality is an important part of our life. It is a part of wellness, and many clients have a deep spiritual life. 

00:50:00
GERI MILLER Spirituality can give people a purposefulness in life and a reason to connect with others. It can also provide them with hope and resilience. When we talk about spirituality, we are focusing on the intrapersonal issues such as abuse and addiction. The interpersonal domestic violence issues for example or family systemic issues, and societal, issues such as homelessness, unemployment, human rights, and social justice. Spirituality can help clients, because it can help them change, it can help them function better, it can help them develop a sense of themselves, a sense of maturity. And it can help them with their potential, particularly around making sense out of their existence. 

00:50:55
SAM GLADDING As we’ve discussed spirituality can have a negative side. And it’s important to focus on love-based versus fear-based forms of spirituality. And remember, how positive spirituality lets us see others from an I thou perspective as opposed to seeing others as objects. We’ve tried to give you some ways to cultivate your spirituality too such as doing a Spiritual Genogram, listening to music, journaling, and mindful meditation. 

00:51:25
GERI MILLER We hope you enjoyed and learned from the two interviews of individuals at different stages and ages in their career, on how they think about and practice spirituality. We hope you benefited from our focus on how spirituality has affected our lives as counselors. 

00:51:45
SAM GLADDING Spirituality and counseling will continue to be important. We wish you the best in working with spiritual questions and issues in your own life and in the lives of your clients.
