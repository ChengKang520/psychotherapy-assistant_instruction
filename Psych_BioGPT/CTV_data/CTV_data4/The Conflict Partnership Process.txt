The Conflict Partnership Process

00:00:55
Skills for resolving conflicts and building relationships 

00:01:05
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS One of the basic principles of existence is that diversity is healthy. Differences among people and ideas can help open up a variety of windows in our minds and help us explore alternatives. And where there is diversity there will sometimes be conflict, because conflict is one of the natural outgrowths of diversity. And many people around the world think that conflict is negative. And of course we all know that many conflicts do end up with damage to individuals, to relationships, to groups. But that's because of the way we deal with conflict, not because conflict is inherently negative. If we learn and utilize effective proven skills, conflict can result in clarifying, and even improving relationships. In my work around the world, I have seen five major ineffective approaches in the way people try to deal with conflict. And one of the most popular of these approaches is avoidance. 

00:02:15
[music] 

00:02:15
The Avoidance Approach 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN We need to talk. We need to talk. 

00:02:25
UNKNOWN What about this time? 

00:02:30
UNKNOWN One minute we're yelling at each other, then the next we avoid even being in the same room. Look, something's wrong. 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN Well it's not my fault. 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN I didn't say it was your fault. 

00:02:40
UNKNOWN I've got to go. See you later. 

00:02:45
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS People avoid in several ways. Some try to avoid conflict by refusing to get into relationships with people who are different than they are. Others, when they are in a conflict, simply do not deal with it. Why? Sometimes they think they'll make it worse, or they feel there are no proven effective skills. But trying to avoid a conflict usually worsens it, and also it disempowers all the parties involved because it's like saying we are incapable of effective conflict resolution. 

00:03:20
The Conquest Approach 

00:03:25
UNKNOWN You lost us a major contract. How could you be so stupid? 

00:03:30
UNKNOWN Oh, don't call me stupid! If you'd done your job right we wouldn't be in this mess. 

00:03:30
UNKNOWN I'm reporting you to Victoria. I hope you lose your job. 

00:03:35
UNKNOWN Go ahead. Report me and I'll tell your wife what you did at the conference last week. If you want a war, I'm ready! 

00:03:45
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS Many people see conflict as just one more competition, with the goal being either to damage or conquer or gain advantage over another person or group. Now this conquest approach has predictable results. One, a loser is created who usually wants a rematch so they can try to win next time. And so, the conflict cycle just keeps on going. Another result is that the overall relationship is damaged for the future. And yet another result is that neither party either learns or utilizes constructive power. They use only what I call power over. And finally, perhaps no one really wins using the conquest approach. For even the one who comes out ahead is cheated out of the full contribution of the one who so-called lost. So even the winner may suffer in the long run. 

00:04:50
[music] 

00:04:50
The Role-Dominance Approach 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN You say my teaching is radical, but you've never been to my class, or even looked at the materials I'm using. 

00:05:00
UNKNOWN I've heard enough from the other teachers. There's no place for your methods in my school. 

00:05:05
UNKNOWN But if you would just- 

00:05:05
UNKNOWN I'm the head of this school, and I've appointed a replacement teacher to complete the course. You can finish the remaining two weeks of term. 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN You have no idea how I teach. You have no right to treat me like this. 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN I have every right. My authority gives me the right to do whatever I please. Now leave my office. 

00:05:25
[sil.] 

00:05:30
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS Society gives certain positions and roles more authority than others, and in many cases, this may make sense. But in dealing with conflict, all parties need to contribute to the best possible resolution. The role-dominance approach allows only those in the most dominant roles to decide the outcome. All people have a potentially positive contribution to make even though their role may not be high on society's list. Using the role-dominance approach usually widens the gap between those who have a lot of power over someone else and those who don't have so much power over. And that gap may have been one the causes of the conflict in the first place. And furthermore, the role-dominance approach means that the one in a position society gives lesser power to will not be able to contribute fully to the resolution of a conflict. 

00:06:35
[music] 

00:06:35
The Bandage Approach 

00:06:40
UNKNOWN You're not doing yourself any favors. 

00:06:40
UNKNOWN What's the point? You've got it in for me anyway. 

00:06:40
UNKNOWN I'm here to help. 

00:06:45
UNKNOWN You're going to give me a job? To make some decent money? What do you care? 

00:06:50
UNKNOWN I do care. I'll tell you what, here's my number here at the station. Call me anytime you want to talk. Anytime. 

00:07:05
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS Putting a bandage over a wound without first cleaning out the wound doesn't do much good. And the same is true in using the bandage approach in conflict resolution. The heart of the conflict really isn't dealt with, a little part may be treated, but significant conflict resolution really isn't done. Now in the scene you have just witnessed, the youth may feel a bit more cared for, but he and his friends need job opportunities. And the police and the city need for the youth to spend their time productively. So the bandage approach creates the false illusion that conflict resolution has been done. Then when things don't work out, people often give up on trying really effective conflict resolution approach. 

00:08:00
[music] 

00:08:00
The Bargaining Approach 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN With imports coming in, our profit margins are being cut to shreds. 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN We're not unreasonable. We really the company's cutting back. Our workers will take eight percent. 

00:08:15
UNKNOWN Three percent, but that's the bottom line. 

00:08:15
UNKNOWN Six! 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN The board's not going to like this, 4.5 percent. 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN 4.5? 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN If you don't accept that, negotiations are over. You explain it to the workers. You didn't accept four and a half. 

00:08:30
UNKNOWN Okay, but watch out when this contract's up. 

00:08:35
UNKNOWN Don't threaten me! I can play that game too, you know? 

00:08:40
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS Bargaining may be the most popular conflict management approach, but it has within it several problems which keep it from being effective and sustainable. One, it usually begins with demands, and demands always make the other party feel defensive. Two, these demands are usually about a particular conflict, and therefore, there isn't much focus on the overall relationship of which any conflict is but one part. Now third problem is that the energy of bargaining is in concessions, in what you try to get the other one to give up. The energy isn't in what they build together. Also another problem is that whoever can afford to give up the most concessions without being damaged will probably come out ahead. And finally, as we saw in the last scene, the relationship really has not been improved.

00:09:35
Focus on Individual and Shared Needs Develop Power-WITH Focus on the Present and Future, Learn from the Past 

00:09:35
Generate Options Develop Do-ables Develop Mutual Benefit Agreements 

00:09:40
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS Avoidance, conquest, role-dominance, bandage, bargaining. All are popular, yet inadequate, ways of trying to deal with conflicts effectively and sustainably. Based on my work in all types of conflict throughout the world, over the past 20 years, I have developed a process I call conflict partnership. Why partnership? Well, conflict may be adversarial, but it there's going to be effective and sustainable conflict resolution, eventually the parties must work together in partnership. Based on specific and proven skills, we can name, we can remember, and we can use, the conflict partnership process gives us a reliable way to deal with a particular conflict effectively, to improve the overall relationship, and to learn specific skills for the future. Conflict partnership is not theory. It is proven effective in all types of conflicts, and it's based on what I call partnership life skills, skills that are down inside all of us and are essential for sustainable and effective relationships and resolving conflicts. And these are the partnership lifeskills. Invite a partnership atmosphere, clarify perceptions of the relationship, of the conflict, of the self, of the other party, focus on individual and shared needs, develop what I call Power-WITH, focus on the present and future and learn from the past, generate options, develop do-ables, and develop mutual benefit agreements. All of these skills need to be used throughout the process of improving a relationship and resolving a conflict. And in the drama you are about to see, each of these skills will be demonstrated and it is taken from an actual conflict situation. The elected leaders of the two committee factions are Maria and Moso (ph). Maria represents the childcare center and Moso the parking building. Now, they have cooperated together in the past on certain projects, but this current conflict over the use of the land and the money has turned them, seemingly, into enemies. And the demonstration that you will soon see, Maria will be using the partnership life skills she has just learned. Moso is unaware of these skills at first, but watch how he is invited into the process by Maria's use of the skills. 

00:12:40
[music] 

00:12:40
Invite a Partnership Atmosphere 

00:12:45
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS We begin with the skill, Invite a Partnership Atmosphere. Now both parties don't have to accept the partnership at first, but one will need to initiate the skill. The atmosphere is sort of like the, the canvas on which people will paint how they deal with their differences and whether or not they improve the situation. So the opening words we use, the time and the place we deal with the conflict, and focusing on what the broader relationship needs, not just on this one conflict. These are all part of the skill, Invite a Partnership Atmosphere. In the community improvement committee conflict you're just about to see, remember that Maria will be using the partnership life skills. Now she has invited Moso to a meeting in a quiet place, after work, and she's going to begin by demonstrating the skill Invite a Partnership Atmosphere. So let's let the drama begin. 

00:13:45
Invite a Partnership Atmosphere 

00:13:50
MARIA We've worked well together in the past, Moso. And I want to work with you now, not against you, for the sake of the committee and the community we both care about. I believe we can work together on this. 

00:14:00
MOSO So you're prepared to be constructive then? That's encouraging. But if you think I'm going to change my mind, you've got another think coming. 

00:14:05
MARIA Moso, we've got to solve this thing or it's going to get solved for us in a way that's not positive for anyone. It's up to us. 

00:14:15
MOSO But we have a solution. The local retailers are crying out for more car parking space. They're losing money to the malls. And if the retailers are losing, the city's losing. 

00:14:25
MARIA Moso, we've been at it like this for two months, and we haven't accomplished anything. Let's try to work together this time. The community needs us to do it, and so does the future of our committee. 

00:14:40
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS Now I'm sure you saw that Maria definitely invited a partnership atmosphere. Now, Moso didn't accept it, or trust it at first, but she didn't give up. She kept using those skills that she knows are effective. She remained in charge of herself. She also mentioned their past cooperation, which was good because it puts a focus on the overall relationship, not just on this current conflict. And she also chose a good time and a good place for the meeting. 

00:15:15
[music] 

00:15:15
Clarify Perceptions 

00:15:15
Clarify Perceptions: of the Relationship of the Conflict of the Self of the Other Party or Parties 

00:15:15
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS When we invite a partnership atmosphere, we have to live up to that invitation by using all of the other partnership life skills. And one of the most critical of those skills is clarifying perceptions, perceptions of the relationship, perceptions of the conflict, of the self, and of the other party or parties. Perceptions are sort of like the, the lenses we use to interpret everything around us. Now people don't have to perceive things the same way, but they do need to clarify their perceptions to themselves and to each other. We need to clarify our perceptions of the relationship. What does the overall relationship need, not just what do I want out of this particular conflict, because people can "win" a conflict but hurt the overall relationship. So, let's look now how Maria uses this skill Clarifying Perceptions. And notice that she asks a lot of good questions. She doesn't just preach or make statements. 

00:16:25
MARIA Now what do you think we need to achieve in this meeting, Moso? 

00:16:30
MOSO You know as well as I do. We need to decide on a project. If we don't, the land and the money are withdrawn. 

00:16:35
MARIA And the committee dies. 

00:16:35
MOSO And our jobs. 

00:16:40
MARIA So we both agree it's very serious. 

00:16:40
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS We need to clarify our perceptions of the conflict. I need to understand what I think it's about, and what the other party thinks it's about. And also, we need to look at the various components of the conflict and which ones we should work on first. 

00:17:00
MARIA All right. Well, I think I understand your reasons for wanting the parking building, but let me hear them one more time in case I've missed something. 

00:17:05
MOSO The retailers for starters. The parking building will bring revenue for the city. It will provide safe and convenient parking for the commuters and residents. We both know that car theft is on the up. And with gang violence, workers are getting mugged on the long walks to their cars. Those are the main reasons, but I've told you all of this before. 

00:17:30
MARIA I know, I know. I just wanted to make sure. So I hear you saying revenue to the city, safety and convenience are your main reasons, right? 

00:17:35
MOSO Mmm hmm. 

00:17:35
MARIA Would you like to hear my reasons for the childcare center again? 

00:17:40
MOSO Not really, but I did appreciate you listening to mine. So, go ahead. 

00:17:45
MARIA Okay, well, one, our workers need a childcare center for their children during the days, especially with the increasing number of families with both parents working. And two, the center could provide steady jobs for our community and- 

00:17:55
MOSO So would the parking building. 

00:18:00
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS We also need to clarify perceptions of the self. What do I need, not just what do I want? And what connects me to the other party, not just what defines us? And also, knowing that I will feel more secure if the other party also feels secure in our relationship. And we need to clarify perceptions of the other party. What do they need, not just what I want them to have or think they should have. And I need to be reaching for their positive potential, not just looking at what I perceive as the negative behavior they are showing in this one conflict because they are more than just that negative behavior in this one conflict. 

00:18:40
MARIA Moso, I think we may need to focus on more than our two conflicting project ideas. Look, we're both community leaders. How do you think this conflict between us is affecting community cooperation? 

00:18:55
MOSO Well, it's obviously hurting the community. I mean, you only have to read the local papers to see the conflict it's causing. The problem is, no. 

00:19:05
MARIA Go on. 

00:19:05
MOSO Well, it's you people that don't want to cooperate anyway. 

00:19:10
MARIA What do you mean by that, you people? 

00:19:10
MOSO You know, your lot. 

00:19:15
MARIA Do you think race has something to do with this. 

00:19:15
MOSO Maybe. 

00:19:15
MARIA But aren't some of my people supporting your parking project? And some of your people are supporting my childcare center idea. 

00:19:25
MOSO Okay, okay. Maybe it's not an ethnic thing. But, all of this arguing is doing the community no good. 

00:19:30
MARIA Let me get this straight. Are you saying you're not going to support my childcare center? 

00:19:35
MOSO Never. 

00:19:35
MARIA I'm not going to agree to your parking project. 

00:19:45
[music] 

00:19:45
Focus on Individual and Shared Needs 

00:19:50
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS I'm sure you've seen Maria and Moso clarifying many perceptions, but they need to use the other partnership lifeskills also. And they seem to have reached a point of, of, of impasse, neither getting their demands met. The skill, Focus on Individual and Shared Needs can help us move beyond impasse. Needs are more important than desires. Individual needs are important, but so are shared needs. Shared needs are kind of the building blocks of effective conflict resolution, and those are needs that all the parties share in common and can't get without working together. Now, as Maria use this skill, Focus on Individual and shared Needs, notice how Moso also starts to use the skill, because he realizes it will help him get some of the things he needs, like resolving the conflict. 

00:20:45
Focus on Individual and Shared Needs 

00:20:45
MARIA And whatever happens, we've got a wonderful opportunity here. We can't let this land or money slip through our fingers. We owe it to the community. 

00:20:55
MOSO And apart from anything else, it's not going to do our credibility any good if we lose it all. That's not the reason why I became a committee member. 

00:21:00
MARIA Well, maybe that's what we need to do. 

00:21:05
MOSO What? 

00:21:05
MARIA Go back and look at what made us want to serve on the committee in the first place. I mean, I was brought up here and I care about this city. I want it to improve, and I believe I've got something to contribute. That's why I stood up for the committee. 

00:21:15
MOSO That's exactly the same for me. The city needs this land and this money and a good project. 

00:21:20
MARIA Well, we both want the city to use this land and money. So perhaps what we're saying here is we could put aside our own personal projects for a while and try to talk about some of the community needs that we both think are crucial. 

00:21:35
MOSO Makes a lot of sense. 

00:21:40
[music] 

00:21:40
Develop Power-WITH 

00:21:45
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS In its most generic definition, power is the ability or the capacity to perform effectively. But many people have twisted that meaning to mean that we're powerful when we have power over somebody. But the most effective and sustainable kind of power in relationships and in conflict resolution is what I call Power-WITH. It is the energy of effective relationship building and conflict resolution. Rather than trying to find our strength and how much control we have over somebody, we need to develop the much more effective and constructive strength in working with someone, not against them. So now that they have clarified some important perceptions and they have identified individual and shared needs, let's look how both Maria and Moso use this skill of developing Power-WITH. 

00:22:45
Develop Power-WITH 

00:22:50
MARIA Which of these are the priority needs of our community? 

00:22:55
MOSO Hmm. Well the priorities areas are public transport system, uh, youth gang situation, and small business development. 

00:23:05
MARIA And the River Jackson pollution problem. Now that needs immediate attention as well. Okay, so we agree these are key needs. Well, how do you think we can work together on some of these? 

00:23:15
MOSO Hmm. Let's be honest. I'm not sure that we can work together on this. I mean, yeah, these are all very important areas, but if I can't get a green light on my parking building, my supporters are going to think I'm a joke. 

00:23:30
MARIA Well, let's just deal with one thing at a time. Aside from our respective supporters, do you want to work with me, Moso? Or more important, do you think we need to work together? 

00:23:40
MOSO Well, when we're doing it like this, it certainly feels better than working against you. So, to answer your question, yes, I think we do need to work together on this, uhm, for the sake of the committee and for the community. 

00:23:55
MARIA Good. That's what I think too. 

00:23:55
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS Maria has constantly been developing Power-WITH and reaching for it in Moso. And Moso has started to use Power-WITH because he realizes he's stronger working with Maria than against her. 

00:24:15
[music] 

00:24:15
Focus on the Present and Future, Learn from the Past 

00:24:15
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS Many people spend their energy re-fighting the battles of the past. They use the past as a kind of weapon against the other party. But in conflict partnership, we try to find some agreements, however small, for the present and the future first, and then that helps us be able to deal with the past more effectively. One helpful way to learn from the past is to trace back to a time before the conflict started or became worse, and ask ourselves the question, what could we have done differently, perhaps using one of the partnership lifeskills to help lead thing in a more constructive direction than the one we took. It can also be helpful to focus on something positive in the past as Maria did in her very opening comment. So, as Maria and Moso try to activate Power-WITH, let's look at how this skill, of focusing on the present, future, and learning from the past, can help. 

00:25:15
Focus on the Present and Future, Learn from the Past 

00:25:15
MARIA Remember the Our Home project we developed for the homeless? 

00:25:20
MOSO Of course, it was a great success. 

00:25:20
MARIA And the Keep it Clean environmental campaign? Now that went really well. 

00:25:25
MOSO Yeah, we've done some good work. 

00:25:25
MARIA So what did we do together that made it so successful? 

00:25:30
MOSO Well, we shared our ideas. We worked out a process. We didn't try and do it all at once. 

00:25:35
MARIA And we agreed on what we weren't going to try to do. So maybe we could agree on what we're not going to waste our time fighting about. 

00:25:40
MOSO We can start by not fighting about our two conflicting issues. 

00:25:45
MARIA That's a good place to begin, I think. 

00:25:50
MOSO I mean, why are we letting ourselves get trapped into thinking that it has to either be your idea or mine? We've identified a whole lot of other community needs that maybe we wouldn't fight about. How about if we put the parking building and the childcare center on hold just 'til the next financial year? 

00:26:10
MARIA Well, we're both concerned about our supporters and our credibility as community leaders. 

00:26:15
MOSO Yeah, but if we leave ourselves out of the picture, put the community first- 

00:26:20
MARIA Right, we're moving forward. So let's keep going. 

00:26:20
MOSO Okay. 

00:26:25
[music] 

00:26:25
Generate Options 

00:26:30
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS People can feel in partnership. They can clarify perceptions. They can identify individual and shared needs. They can learn from the past. But unless they take some action steps, they're not going to resolve a conflict. So the skill of generating options helps us find those action steps. Now, many people get stuck on their demands as being the only options. But effective options are those that meet needs, are those that help us take effective steps toward improving the relationship, and those things that all the parties can do. 

00:27:05
Generate Options 

00:27:10
MOSO Okay. Well, we've got a few options than we realized. 

00:27:10
MARIA Yeah, there seem to be some common threads, don't you think? 

00:27:15
MOSO Yeah, we've identified a lot of shared needs of the community. 

00:27:15
MARIA Uh, like uh, youth programs, the small businesses, public transportation. 

00:27:20
MOSO What do you think's most feasible with the amount of land and money that we've been given? 

00:27:30
[music] 

00:27:30
Develop Do-ables 

00:27:30
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS What I call Do-ables, able to do, are agreements on smaller steps that help sort of build a pathway to effective conflict resolution and dealing with the bigger things. They are literally kind of stepping stones along this pathway, and each one helps us see where the next one may be. Now, people cannot go straight from major problem to big solution, so these Do-ables really help. And, Maria and Moso, as we have seen, have already come up with two small Do-ables, one was to agree not to get stuck on their original demands or pet projects. And the other was they're going to go back to some of the other needs of the community and see a basis for a project there. And now, Maria and Moso must find more specific action steps, more specific Do-ables. 

00:28:25
Develop Do-ables 

00:28:25
MOSO Going back to the community needs, I'd like to think about small business development. 

00:28:30
MARIA I would too, but I just don't see how we could put a business project on the amount of land we've been given. 

00:28:40
MOSO No, that wouldn't work. How about something dealing with the youth. They're obviously feeling quite alienated at the moment and the gang situation has gotten worse. 

00:28:50
MARIA That's a real possibility. What about a youth center? 

00:28:55
MOSO Good idea. But wouldn't that take a long time to set up? 

00:28:55
MARIA Maybe that could be our long-term agreement. And in the meantime, what about some smaller pilot projects? 

00:29:05
MOSO It'd be a good idea to work on the gang violence. 

00:29:10
MARIA Okay. What about a public meeting to discuss it? 

00:29:10
MOSO We've done enough talking on this issue. We need to do something now. Uhm, how about setting up some conflict resolution workshops in the schools?

MARIA Yes, that would be a good smaller pilot project. Now there's that youth worker who's just moved to town. He's got a good track record. Perhaps we could ask him to start to make contact with the gangs here.

Develop Mutual Benefit Agreements 

00:29:35
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS The smaller step, which is the conflict resolution workshop in the school, represents the Do-able. And the larger step of the youth center, that is the mutual benefit agreement. But Maria and Moso never would have come to this mutual benefit agreement without using all of the conflict partnership skills because the mutual benefit agreements are the culmination of the conflict partnership process. We now turn to Maria and Moso one last time to see how they're going to make their agreements sustainable into the future so that they will have improved their relationship, not only dealt with this current conflict. So watch how they are very specific and clear about their action steps and who does what.

Develop Mutual Benefit Agreements 

00:30:25
MARIA Let's not forget about our youth in the streets. But in the meantime, how can we go about getting conflict resolution workshops in the schools? 

00:30:35
MOSO Well, the chairman of the school board should be supportive, maybe even put some resources our way. I can give her a call tomorrow if that's okay with you? 

00:30:45
MARIA Good. And I can speak to the head of the Parent Teachers Association. 

00:30:45
MOSO We've done well here today. 

00:30:50
MARIA And we've done it together. So, what have we agreed to here? 

00:30:55
MOSO Okay, we get started on the initial training programs this month, with you talking to the Parent Teachers Association and I'll talk to the school board. 

00:31:05
MARIA Okay. I'll start looking for conflict resolution trainers for the use on the streets and for the schools. And perhaps you and I can talk to that gang youth worker who's moved to town about working with the committee? 

00:31:15
MOSO And once we've talked to the mayor and the committee, we should hold a press conference, finally show the community that we can work together on this. 

00:31:20
MARIA Who's going to call the mayor? 

00:31:20
MOSO Let's do it together, darling. 

00:31:25
MARIA Come on, then. We can call from reception. 

00:31:30
MOSO Okay. 

00:31:30
DR. DUDLEY WEEKS All of us do have the ability to resolve conflicts effectively and to use our differences to improve our relationships, whether it be in friendships, in the family, in our organizations and businesses and institutions, in our society, and in this human family that we're all a part of.
