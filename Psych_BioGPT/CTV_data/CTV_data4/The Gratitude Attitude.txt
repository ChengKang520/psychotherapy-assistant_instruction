DR. ANNA B. BARANWOSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you, in your trauma recovery, right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do their best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is the gratitude attitude. Sometimes it's difficult to focus on the little things that we are grateful for, and yet it often, this simple exercise is what turns life around for many. We're exactly where we are in our lives in this precise moment and that's what it is. For some this might be dealing with very serious reality of loss and pain. But along with that, is life and possibilities. Look around you, and ask yourself, what are you grateful for, right now, is there something that you have in your life today, regardless of the trauma and loss. That still feels right. Maybe you like your job or you have a friend that knows what to say, and really just understands you, leaves you feeling understood. Maybe it's a sunny day or you are able to take the time to the outside. Whatever it is, make a note of it, make a note it at least three things, small or large, simple or complex, write them down and notice how they make you feel, spend some time reflecting on the things that you can appreciate, even simple fix. In one research study, two groups people kept dairies, one group noted what they did, while the other group wrote a gratitude list, the members on the gratitude group endorsed higher levels of enthusiasm, optimism and energy, and they also felt less stressed and depression. Thankfully gratitude can be learned and practiced every day. Practice this again throughout the day, whenever you need or want to recapture feelings of comfort and calm, just recall three things, simple or complex. Take the time to do this, right now, and take the time now to form a new healthy practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
