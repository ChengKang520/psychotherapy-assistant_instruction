UNKNOWN I'm really proud to, ah, introduce, ah, Dr. Don Meichenbaum. He's, uhm, I want to say that he is modern-classic of 2013. He's just, ah, a really amazing man, ama-- amazing contributor to society and he'd likes to bring it down to the level of, uhm, ah, the, the narrative, the story, and so listen to his stories closely. He, uhm, has, ah, founded the Melissa Institute for Violence Prevention which is, ah, a fantastic website to tune into. As a matter of fact, this last year, more than 2 million people have tuned in and so if we add us here, there's gonna be another thousand. His latest book is the Roadmaps to Resilience and it explores the spirituality as a means for bolstering resilience, extremely important and his discussant is a man that we all love, Dr. Erving Polster and he is, uhm, is phenomenal to what he's contributed to the world of our psychotherapy and gestalt and some of his book include Gestalt Therapy Integrated, Uncommon Ground, Every Person's Life Is Worth A Novel, A Population of Selves, and From The Radical Center. And so without further ado, please.

DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Thank you very much, right. Well. On this Sabbath I'm glad you all came to our presentation on spirituality and religion and so forth. Uhm, I have, ah, an interesting journey to share with you and that is I went to graduate school at the University of Illinois in Champaign from 1962 to 1966 when I got my PhD in clinical psychology. At that time, ah, you were not encouraged or permitted to use the word cognition, ah, you could not publish an article in Java that uses the word cognition. This was when it was highly behavioral and more over, one of the things that was highlighted was the kind of view of thinking processes as operance, covariance, you know, subject to the laws of learning and so forth, okay. So here's the question. How did someone who was trained in a behavioral program now get to present on spirituality and religion? My advisers would turn over in their grave if they heard this presentation. Not only that, if you were supervised by a clinician, you are not permitted to share with that supervisor, unless you come from very special programs that you have addressed spirituality let alone that the concept of God has ever entered your therapeutic process. Now, no matter what your religious beliefs are, I am going to tell you how I got from that point to this point. I am going to share with you the data on the incidents of people's beliefs in spirituality. I spend a great deal of time with people who have been traumatized or victimized whether it's Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Sandy, whether it's my recent consultation at the Boston Clinic where they were treating the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing, whether it's in the aftermath of Columbine or 9/11. The major way that people in North America cope with trauma is to use some form of spirituality. In fact, I am going to show you a film of entitled-- it's a documentary from Frontline, a portion of it called Where Was God On 9/11? And I want you to think about how your treatment with very-- if one of these three folks was your client. We are going to talk about the functions of spirituality, I'm gonna give you multiple examples of evidence-based interventions. There are now evidence-based interventions that have affect sizes of .51. For example, Rebecca Propst developed cognitive behavior therapy for depressed born-again Christians. There are similar manuals for Hasidic Jews, Islam, Catholics, and the like. So, the interesting question is, you know, if you had one of these folks, what would you do? How would you, in a sensitive fashion, engage in? Last point before I get to the data. I think we are all not only Homo Sapiens but we are Homo Narrens, that we have the ability to tell stories. And I'm-- for some people, religious metaphor and belief are central to their story telling. Now whether you believe the story or not isn't the critical issue as a therapist. The question is how do you use that therapeutically? And then finally, I'm going to talk about the caveats and the way in which spirituality and religion can backfire. Look, I live in Clearwater, Florida. Clearwater, Florida is the home of Scientology. I got Cruise, Travolta, Kelly Preston-- these are the people coming to my town, okay. I have hundreds of people walking around who have board in to Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard. I drive-- that's where Starbucks is in the middle of their town. So, the key question is h-- h-- how, how did people get caught into various cultural groups? Okay, let's get to that task at hand. How did I get here?

DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM So, I get involved in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. I speak to a young girl, she's 10 years old. She and her grandmother during the flooding went to the roof of their house. They watch bodies go by, she tells me that she was saved in a special way. She and her grandmother went to the roof and her grandmother told her to keep singing Amazing Grace and that they were more likely to be heard by God because they were on the roof. At-- and, and for that two hours when all of the destruction and the like, this woman use the spirituality and the belief and faith in order to help her granddaughter to get through that process. I have worked with native populations. There's a group in a, in Canada call the Inuit. They were rather nomadic and follow the caribou around and when the caribou became ill, ah, the government reconfigure their lives. Ah, they didn't call it reservations but you could imagine the impact of that had. There were also well-intentioned and brought in their reading specialist for the children. Unfortunately, the reading specialist was a pedophile who sexually abused 86 boys over the course of three years. That cohort has one of the highest suicide rates in North America. I had the opportunity to work with native healers. So, the question is what does someone who does evidence-based cognitive behavior therapy have to offer let alone learn in terms of their healing ceremonies? I have had an opportunity to consult at various residential treatment programs and address victimization like PTSD, complex PTSD, and substance abuse. And every one of these programs that I consulted, they have 12-step AA programs. So, I have had opportunities to sit on meetings and you'll see in your handout, we have even developed a checklist ascertain what is it that people do in 12-step programs. What is it about the AA program? Is it the spirituality? Is the social connection? What's the data look like that why should that be in any way therapeutically effective? In the book that was referred to by Roadmap to Resilience, we not only included physical, interpersonal, cognitive, behavioral, spiritual-- I'm sorry, ah, physical, interpersonal, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive but we've also-- I also included spiritual. Because if you look at the way in which service members there as well as those returning use spirituality. A part of it, as you'll see, has highlighted what are adaptive coping spiritual techniques and what are counterproductive spiritual techniques. So, when you get to the Roadmap to Resilience book, you'll be able to see how this has been amplified. I could let you know that I have provided a handout on this presentation at the conference that includes these pages 276 to 358 in case you have nothing to look at on the way home. So, in short, whether I am dealing with native populations, returning service members, trauma victims, and the like this comes into play. Now, how widespread is this? Over 93% of people in North America believe in God or a higher power, 60% belong to a religious belong, only 11% of the population in North America believe that religion and spirituality is unimportant. Actually, it's higher among psychotherapist than it is among clients. Okay. One of the things that becomes interesting is that 30% of your adults that you see in therapy actually pray on a daily basis, 80% pray when they are in some kind of serious crisis, the notion that there is no atheist in the foxhole becomes a relevant kind of issue. Seventy percent believe in an afterlife, so one of the things that becomes very interesting is when your clients come in, one of the things that these surveys find is that often clients wanna talk about the spiritual impact that this has, the meaning, but therapist don't allow it or probe about it. So, the interesting issue that I'm gonna comment on is how do you assess for spirituality. Now, when I talk about spirituality, that's different than religion. These are separate kinds of concepts in a sense that spirituality is searching for some higher meaning i-- in the way that Frankl and others have described it where religion has a similar search may have more specific kinds of rituals that people engage in. It's interesting to know that the word spirituality, ah, is not only an attempt to define some kind of meaning but if you look at the, ah, the epimo-- ep-- the, ah, the origins of the word spirituality, it comes from the Latin word spirare which means to blow or to have a breath. So therefore you can start to see the way in which people are searching for, ah, these kinds of elements. Let me give you just a few more examples before we get in to the function and showing you the movie. A national survey conducted by Schuster and her colleagues after the terrorist attack at 9/11 and I was there, ah, in the aftermath of that indicated 90% of individuals reported that they turn to some form of prayer religion or some form of spirituality in order to cope with the aftermath of that event. Following Hurricane Katrina, 92% of those affected turn to some form of spirituality. When a tornado hit a small church in Piedmont, Alabama that killed several children, one of the things that the minister said and, and this was really interesting cuz I got invited to, ah, present-- I, I work with the military chaplains. Ah, that's interesting cuz if you're in the military, you don't come to mental health people like me cuz I'm required to report to the commander. So, what you do is you go to a chaplain and what's really neat about chaplain is that between the client, the chaplain, and a higher power and the chaplain does not have to report. So one of the things that became really interesting is how do you teach chaplains to do cognitive behavior therapy. You know, h-- how do you actually do that and I also was invited to talk to people who give sermons that day after disasters. This is, you-- these are kinds of healing ceremonies and as you'll see in the handout, I'm not gonna take time here, we have actually included excerpts from both the Old and New Testament that people can embed within your sermons, you know, about forgiveness and understanding and compassion and so forth. Uhm, ah, I'm not scholarly at this area but fortunately on the Melissa Institute I have ministers both African-American and others who-- I ask them when something happens bad and in, and in Miami it happens all the time with gang shootings and violent deaths and so forth. What did they say to the congregation? So, we actually picked out what are the comforting kinds of metaphors, analogies, and the like that people used, Alabama. They kept asking like "Joe, why?" Why would this happen? Their faith is shaken but it's not the same as losing it. Events like this, they said, only strengthen our faith. Our faith is an anchor in a turbulent sea, those who die inside a church, those who die inside a church will find the gates of heaven open even wider. As long as we have our faith, we are strong. No matter how dark it is, if I have my faith, I have a song in the night. Our reason or faith is not determined by reason alone. There was no ungirded way that you could affect my belief. There was no reason. Elie Wiesel tells in Night that they had a trial for God. The Jews in the concentration camp appointed a lawyer, a prosecutor to see why God couldn't prevent this. They had another lawyer who is defender, they had a jury, they did the trial. They found God guilty and then they all went back to their bunks and prayed. Now, I think that is cool, man. I mean, that i-- I mean-- so what happens is people tell stories, okay, as you about to see in the movie I'm gonna show you. Sometimes the stories are therapeutic and move people in adaptive way. Sometimes the stories that are religious that is I to kill that doctor because he is performing abortions and by killing him I will save life, I am doing God's work and if you look at the history of what mankind is all about, okay. I mean, just look at all of the conflicts that are going on in the world, how much of these are religious based? Sunni and Shiites, Jews and Muslims, okay. So you could start to think about where religion is effective or not. I mean, I, I don't wanna get in to the kitchen's kind of analysis on the, the history of this but let's just play Where Was God On 9/11 and think of yourself as the therapist for these folks.

FRONTLINE BERNIE HEERAN Retired NYC Firefighter 

00:18:35
BERNIE HEERAN I came to church and I, ah, kinda negotiated with God and asked Him to, ah, if He could give me this one but I knew from being a fireman that my son couldn't have been in, in a worse possible position. All the people above-- you, you couldn't have been in a worse spot than anybody in, in that fire.

FRONTLINE SEAN HEERAN Stock Trader 

00:19:05
SEAN HEERAN My brother Charlie and my father were very tight. He just had a special relationship with him. If you're a guy, if you're a girl, you always wanna be around him, always. He lit up a room, he lit up a room and now he's 24 years old. He's just had so much talent and so much potential. Whether it was working on Wall Street, whether it was helping my dad at the bar, he just had a special charisma about him that made people respond to him. 

00:19:35
BERNIE HEERAN I asked Him for help that day and He couldn't do it. You know, and, ah, you know, I was looking for more give backs, I thought a couple of more fireman will walk out of that building but it just didn't work that way. But I continued to ask. His two-- my son's two brothers were there that day. I could have lost three sons and I could have lost more firemen that were there, that I knew, that I've talked to, and they made it. So they're the give backs. I mean, you can't-- I question, "Why not me and leave my son?" I mean, I would have switched. I communicate with to my son through God. I, I would imagine I found myself closer to God because of wanting-- picturing, in fact, that my son is with Him, you know, that's where I want him to be, you know, now he's gonna help me. He's watching me, you know. I tell my friends I gotta be good. My son is watching me now, you know. 

00:20:50
SEAN HEERAN I usually go to Saint Patrick's Cathedral in midtown Manhattan because I feel that it's, it's my brother's home now. I go there to see him. And I just go there and, you know, light a candle and, ah, buy him and his buddies, you know, a beer. I throw a couple of bucks in the little thing, I buy him a beer because just, ah, I got to visit him. 

00:21:20
BERNIE HEERAN At this stage, I haven't questioned Him saying, you know, I asked Him in the beginning, you know, "If you can give me this one, I'd, I'd, I'd appreciate it." But it-- He had nothing to do with this. He-- there were a lot more people that could have been killed. He was fighting the evil that day, like he does every day, you know. The Fire Department calls fire "The Devil." You know, firemen call fire "The Devil." And that day we fought the devil, and we saved a lot of people, you know. But the devil's the devil. You got to, you know, you got to fight the devil. And, ah, just-- God's always around.

FRONTLINE KIM COLEMAN Retired NYC Police Officer 

00:22:15
KIM COLEMAN I realized that the first plane hit my daughter's building. And as I bent over to pick up the telephone, my daughter was on the other line. She didn't know what happened. So I told her that a plane had hit her building and for them to get out of there. And I could hear my daughter tell her co-workers that her mother told her a plane hit the building and they needed to get out. Then she asked me where was her baby. And I told her I had her baby and he was okay. And she asked me just to take care of him, and I said "Okay, just get out of there." And I ran out of my apartment into the hallway, and I was just screaming in the hallway. And all of a sudden, my neighbors came out and they didn't know what happened. And I just said, "My baby's gone!'' That night, when I went to bed, after I finally was able to lay down, there was a light that shines through my window. And for some reason, this light was real bright. And I opened my eyes, and I saw an angel. She was dressed in white and she had a smile on her face, and I took that to believe that she was letting me know that my daughter was in heaven and that she was okay. I just pray every day that she didn't suffer and maybe she just fell off to sleep and she didn't feel anything. I know she was scared, but I know my daughter also has faith in God, so I know she was praying. I never question why God didn't intervene. I often ask the question as to why He picked her, but I have come to the conclusion that I felt God knew something I didn't know. And maybe he felt that-- maybe she was-- even though she was here 23 years, that she was suffering a lot more than I knew about. And I felt that God knew best. I always felt that way when He takes someone, that He knows better than we do. 

00:24:45
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay, before I get to the third one, let's just note a few things about these two folks and note that it is not your responsibility as a therapist to go up to the second woman and go, "Do you ever take physics 101? Do you ever notice that when light hits a prism, it disperses?" I mean, she had created this story that this light is an angel, that God knew something better than she did. So she is fashioning a comforting story and it is not your job to bring in the reality of physics, okay, the alter the nature and content of that story. Not only that-- those are all the physicists applauding right now. So one of the things that becomes really interesting is the nature of the story, you know, that, that they're looking after me, that I could talk to them through God. So if you get to the Roadmap to Resilience book, I have put out an algorithm of what you need to do in the aftermath of trauma to be in the 25% group who are stuck versus the 75% group who are going to be impacted but show res-- resilience. And what-- these set of beliefs has engages them in non-negative thinking. It gets them away from contra-factual thinking. In their back pocket is a social support agent that they could call upon at any given time. This is like outsourcing social support cuz Jesus, your God, is in your back pocket that you could call anytime or you just have to go to the church and that would be supported. And as we see, these kinds of interventions are going to be affective. Not only that they were rituals, let me just give you a couple cuz one of the things is when you go to the Roadmap to Resilience book people are now submitting to the, the website their own examples. So a mother who lost her son at 9/11, a fireman, his body was never found and she submits that every once in a while she gets a call that they have found a body part with his DNA. This woman has now decided to collect all those body parts, put it in a shoe box and will be buried with her. Another father and mother discover that their son's body was never discovered but they discover that he donated blood prior to this happening. They decide, in terms of a funeral and having a proper goodbye that they are going to hire a horse and in that horse put the vial of blood and have all of the policemen honor his memory. A mother in Newtown and this week is the anniversary of Newtown has her young son cremated and has the ashes put in a box at the end of her bed, on the chest there and each morning wakes up and kisses the box and says, how are they're going to transform this pain into something good. What is therapeutic about each of those circumstances? What is therapeutic about Yad Vashem in Israel? What is therapeutic about lighting the six candles in May to memorialize? What is therapeutic about having the doves go off in Hiroshima, Nagasaki on the anniversary? What is it about we, as humans, as storytellers, that these are so important to the recovery and healing process? What functions does it serve? One last gentleman.

FRONTLINE TIM LYNSTON Security Guard 

00:29:05
TIM LYNSTON I really can't see the purpose why all these people had to die. I can't accept this. Right now, God's not giving me that comfort. We're a community in mourning. We were hit pretty bad. I knew close to 30 people who died at the World Trade. Basically, they were firemen, young stockbrokers, sons of friends I knew. I miss them dearly. I don't know if I'm ever gonna get over a couple of-- I mean, ah, we were really tight. You know, we, we did a lot of things together. And I had to come down here to the beachfront to just let loose, and it was brutal. I let loose at God. I fired all my barrels at him. Ah, it might sound crazy, but I cursed Him. I damned Him. I think God could have just ended this all. That's why I feel strongly that I'm losing respect for Him. I know there's a Trinity. I believe in the Son, but the Father I'm having a rough time dealing with. I'm really having a rough time. I didn't have any love for God the weeks that followed September 11th. It was really hatred. I can't accept this unless I can have an answer as to why it all occurred. I come down-- basically, when I come down here, and-- no question about it, I cry when I come down here and I'll talk to my friends. I think my friends can hear me. God knows, they're watching over all of us. I feel sometimes they're helping me, ah, along with my life, trying to make me stronger. It was too barbaric. It was too barbaric, the way the lives were taken. That wasn't mercy. So I look at Him now as a barbarian, and I probably will and, ah, it's a sad situation. I think I'm a good Christian, but I have a different view and image of Him now, and I can't replace it with the old image. I can't replace it with the old image. 

00:31:55
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay. So imagine that these three people individually were referred to you in therapy. No matter what you, ah, do on a regular basis, how, in any way, would you alter therapy specially with the third guy who views God as a barbarian? And you can start to see in terms of my algorithm of what you need to get stuck with is you have to engage in "why" questions for which there's no answer. You have to be Job as compare to King David in the bible, okay, in terms of being stuck on that kind of belief system. Not only that, if you want to remain in the 25% group, one of the things you have to do is ruminate and dwell on it. You cannot just let it go. You wanna remain in the 25% group? You gotta engage in anger, and maybe anger against the VA system and maybe anger against significant others, and maybe anger at the war or may feel anger at God. Anger interferes with the healing and recovery process. So the interesting question and I, you know, uhm, have more time and the lights are on and so forth. I stopped and I said, "What would you do with this third guy? Okay? What opening did he give you? What potentials would you pluck and use therapeutically?" What does he say? He says, "I'm a good Christian," okay, No, I-- we have a fielding with that, right? Remember, I'm just a plucker. People talking in paragon and they go, "Good Christian? What does that mean? They're looking down on you? They're giving you-- what advice would they have?" Did anyone catches his occupation? Ah, he's a security guard. Where is he security guard? 9/11 building. So where was he? So what other affective experiences does he have besides the anger in terms of guilt, sense of responsibility, and the like? So, when is his anger getting in the way off, that-- does a good Christian give-- engage in forgiveness? Does a, does a good Christian have compassion? Good, good Christian? Tell me about it. Okay. For those who have been at my other workshops, I try to emulate that fine inquisitor of Peter Falk playing the character Columbo. And so I'm always, "Go-- good Christian?" Okay. And I want him to spell out what is a good Christian and what did he in the past? Is this first loss or not? Okay, so on your hand out, I have a whole section there on the functions of spirituality and so 287 when you get to that handout, so I'll just tick some of these off and then we'll get to assessment and interventions and then I'll turn it over my distinguished colleague, Erv Polster. So, one of the things that this spirituality does is to encourage people to engage in non-negative thinking. It normalizes the reaction cuz you're often part of a group in functions by sharing your emotional reactions. One of the things we know if you wanna stay in the 25% group is to keep it a secret. Do not share it, do not go for help. So, being a member of a spiritual going to the congregation so forth from its prayer becomes a powerful way of healing and, in fact, I enumerate the variety of different kinds of prayers and it will be valuable for you, the therapist, to understand what kind of praying someone does. One of the things we know is that people often feel abandoned by God. God would have prevented this. I mean, if He's all knowing and all powerful, why didn't He stop this meeting with death? He's just a barbarian. He was absent for a day, He was off, He was off duty that day or He did this on purpose, okay. He's punishing me for my sins. So, start to think about what's the nature of the story you tell yourself or others as to whether you're gonna be in the 25% group or the 75%. And when I talk about 25 and 75, it's not like you're resilient or you're having PTSD. These are co-occurring events and you go from one to the other in terms of the nature of the therapeutic process. And encourage to share the grief. I mean, I mean, it-- just look at Newtown or look at any of these aurora or just what happened, you know, o-- outside Co-- Columbine just the other day at the high school. They're gonna have candlelight ceremonies, they have vigils, you become part of a group process that's an element of the healing journey that individuals are engaged in. It provides guidance. So one of the things that I have included in the handout here is a lot of quotes from Rabbi Kushner who wrote about why do bad things happen to good people, okay. And some of them that I like are as follows - so Rabbi Kushner ask of the countrymen, if you don't believe in God, why do you go to the synagogue so regularly. The guy answers, "Jews go to the synagogue for all sorts of reasons. My friend Garfinkle, he goes, he's orthodox, he goes to talk to God. I go to talk to Garfinkle." Okay, so, one of the things that happens is there's an attempt to help people understand that the question we should be asking is not "Why did this happen to me? What did I do to deserve this?" That is really the unanswerable question. It's pointless. A better question would be, "Now that this has happened, what am I going to do about it?" So, what they're trying to do is to get people away from "why" questions into "what" and "how" questions. "In the final analysis, the question of why bad things happen to good people translates into some very different kinds of questions," Kushner says. "No longer asking why something happened but asking how we will respond, what we intend to do now, how do I create a life that's worth meaning, how do I make a gift of my experience." Those native populations have people go to spiritual ceremonies sweat lodge, drumming, chanting, and the like. They then take the wounded warrior and put him or her in the middle of a circle, the take the members of the community around the edge of a circle and ask the person in the middle given that he or she has gone through spiritual cleansing to share what are the lessons that he or she learned that the rest of the community could benefit from, okay. The VA has incorporated that as part of its treatment in a number of hospitals, okay. So, how do you get people to find meaning in a Viktor Frankl sense? How do you get them to transform? How do you get them to make a gift of? How do you put them on a spiritual journey? See, nothing is going to bring back Melissa to the parents who created the Melissa Institute but they have the notion that they could prevent one more Melissa, she would not have died in vain. These are spiritual journeys. What's the whole point of MADD, you know, Mothers Against Drunk Driving or all these other organizations where people take their pain and transform it into a spiritual journey so that they can get unstuck. You do not cure PTSD when disastrous event occur. Early on in the week I gave this case about a mother who inadvertently killed her daughter, blew her brains out, okay, and we use the apps and other. In this case, the dead child to give advice to the mother, okay. Not only that, this mother not only had to not kill herself which she was contemplating but, moreover, she now takes on a mission to educate parents about the dangers of keeping guns in the house. She makes it-- nothing cures the PTSD. You know, you help the person take this landmark event, this tragedy whether it's Katrina, Newtown, and embed it into a larger coherent narrative. In fact, Bruen and their colleagues in the study of PTSD have enumerated that it is the retrieval of positive memories that contextualize the pain that is part of the healing process and for many that contextualization is their spirituality. Just a few last points, if I may. So one of the interesting aspects of this has to do with my putting together on page 309 of your handout when you download it as well as on 301 checklist. So, on 301, one of the things you will find is a checklist that I would ask you to fill out and say how many of these activities do you presently use as part of your therapy process, okay. So, for example, if I came in and watch you and your clinic operating, do you com-- communicate explicit to the client in terms of inform consent or the nature of your intake questionnaires that you will be willing to raise and discuss the issues of spirituality. Do you systematically assess your client for spi-- spirituality and I've included a number of self-report scales and a number of questions you could ask in terms of getting their genogram, their developmental history and the like. I don't have enough time to repeat this but if you're interested in that, please go to the downloadable aspect. Conduct an assessment of the developmental history a-- and I'll work with African-American youth in Miami, one of the major question that we ask is when is the last time you went to church and who took you. That turns out to be a really important protective factor and the role that the church plays in that community is really key and the Melissa Institute works with African-American ministers cuz they are the gatekeepers, they are the advisers in that particular arena and therefore, the way in which we incorporate them as co-therapist, as supervisors of our own interventions, okay, would you refer someone to 12-step programs? The other kinds of self-help groups in that particular dimension. Do you-- and you can look at other kinds of items that I've included here, do you engage clients in spiritual discussions? Do you talk about the afterlife or the meaning that it was lost as a result to this? Do you use spiritual relaxation and guided imagery procedures? As I mentioned, Rebecca Propst has developed a whole set of procedures on how to do cognitive behavior therapy with born-again Christians and she uses a lot of guided imagery that would be particularly relevant to their. The important element in this is for you not to impose your religious belief or your spiritual notion on what they should do. So, it's always collaborative and seeking their permission and whether this in any way would be helpful. Do you ever use manualized treatments? So, I've enlisted-- included in here the variety of evidence-based, if you're into that, evidence-based manualized treatment for people who are spiritually oriented and this may be communications with one spouse, finding meaning, and the like. And if that's a possibility, I encourage you to track down the, ah, websites there in the Roadmap book, ah, to find out where you co-- do you use forgiveness? All the work by Worthington and their colleagues highlight the degree to which you could use forgiveness, mindfulness, and the like in order to put people in touch with. Moreover, you will see in your handout on page 309 a patient checklist. The patient checklist is really kind of an interesting way to not only do assessment but to also do treatment. So, from our perspective one of the things that's interesting is that if I ask a client to go through this checklist as to whether-- look, look, we've worked with a lot of folks like yourself who've been through these kinds of events and every person's unique, each person's situation is different. So, we have put together and, and see if this resonate-- make sense with you a summary of what clients have shared with us in the past that they have found particularly helpful. Now, what I would like to do and see if you're comfortable with this is to have you take a moment and go through this list and see if any of these were particularly something you used and found helpful. So, note that if I get people to go through all of these suggestions not only doing the assessment, I am going to actually do collaborative treatment cuz I could say of this 20 h-- h-- how did you choose those four? And in what way did you use it? And was there anything of the other 16 that you think might be particularly useful? W-- what advice would you have for? So, what becomes really interesting is that from a cognitive behavior point of view, assessment and treatment are highly intertwined. So, you ask the clients, do-- do you hold beliefs that God rescued you for some kind of special purpose? Do you believe that the traumatic experience made your faith even stronger? Do you feel that, that you're on a pilgrimage of healing, that you're moving from being a victim to a survivor let alone a driver? Do you view God as a supportive partner? Have you learned to walk away from anger and hatred? H-- have you learn to stop dwelling and ruminating on "why" questions? Have you found your faith particularly helpful? Have you attended any particular devotional activities? Do you read the bible? Do you sing? Do you attend prayer? Do you join groups? Have you-- so, you, you can get the flavor of how this kind of assessment tool over and above the art of questioning might be useful. Not that you say you have to do, "Look, everybody's unique. Each person's situation is different." Not only that, one of the things that you'll also see in the handout is a similar checklist for people who go to 12-step programs. I consulted a lot of residential programs and one of things that happens is they-- therapists send the clients to AA meetings when the bus comes. This is really welcomed by the therapist cuz he gets all the clients off campus for two hours. It's like a respite too. Now, the therapists have absolutely no idea what the hell is going on in the AA meeting. Not only that, when people come into treatment and go, "Well, I'd been through AA, okay. You know, I have..." so now we've put together the checklist what does it mean to go through AA. Did you attend meetings? Did you find a sponsor? Did you act as a sponsor? Did you work the steps? So, what happens is inherent in this checklist are particular suggestions. When I was up at the Boston Trauma Society, when we were dealing with prolong and complicated grief, we have put together a similar checklist and we have now enumerated what it is that gets people stuck, the 5 to 10% in the aftermath of, of that kind of tragedy versus the who people make. So, one of the things that we have done a lot of is try to put together running focus groups and others as to how people get stuck and how they get unstuck and how you could build that in this part of the assessment process. Okay, just, ah, one or two other items and then I'll turn it over to my, ah, my colleague. Included also are variety of adaptive coping techniques. So, if you look at all the work on, ah, religious coping skills and the like on faith-based beliefs, there are certain kinds of coping strategies that seemed to be effective all the way from engaging and purification and religious activity or transition activities, there are those kinds of coping strategies which have been found to be unproductive. So, if you are religious and you turn over to God and ask for a miracle, if you go and ask God to intercede, if you see yourself as a victim and, and, and res-- deserving of this, all of those kinds of coping techniques have been found to be unproductive. So, the degree to which your client who may be spiritually oriented actually is engaging in a more collaborative fashion with a higher figure is much more adaptive. That is a partnership as compared to a process where I am going to relinquish responsibility and ask for the kind of miracle question that should go on. Finally, I am in my Miami with the Melissa Institute and one of the aspects that's kind of interesting w-- is working with Latino populations. And if you work with Latino populations as we do, Cubans, Haitians, people who come from Central and South America a central feature of the Latino community is the healing process that involves spirituality. So, the Melissa Institute did a conference on how to do psychotherapy from a cross-culturally sensitive fashion and we have highlighted and I have on the board a number of people who are Latinos who have highlighted the value of using these kinds of belief systems that are essential to their understanding and coping. They may be what is called (inaudible ), this is the notion of using some kind of proverbial statement with clients that they use, you know, like "When one door closes, another opens," "A bad thing can turn into something good," "God helps those who help themselves." So, the degree to which you were saturated and have some appreciation and understanding how their belief systems are incorporated in their beliefs. Not only that, there are a lot of pilgrimages. I lecture in, in Santa Fe and give three-day workshops. So, one of the major things to do is to go Chinmaya. Chinmaya was this te-- temple-- ah, church and people make pilgrimages there and one of the things that becomes rather interesting in those pilgrimages is, is how hush they are and moreover you can go into the church and there's special dirt that you put on your toe. I mean, this is like or a rub, it's kind of thing but native and more colorful. So, one of the things that becomes of interesting is how belief is so powerful and we know that people who are religious or spiritually oriented have better health outcomes. You know, that, that spirituality correlates with, you know, the reduction of depression, substance abuse, smoking, physical ailments and the like and it's not just the course of the relationship, it's that having a spiritual puts you on a lifestyle that increases the helpfulness that you're going to experience as a by-product to that. Once again, let me highlight that your belief whether you're atheist, agnostic, or a believer is not the critical issue, okay. The critical issue is to find out what is the story that clients tell themselves and that they tell others and the degree to which some form of spiritual belief is central to that and whether they have found that particularly helpful and how can you assess for that, get them to take credit for it, and even nurture that process further. It's really amazing how people could believe almost anything, you know, as I was saying, Clear-- i-- i-- in Clearwater, I mean, I love this. They have this glass building and they have window washers coming there and they put on some chemical and lo and behold if you look carefully, it is the exact replica of Mary. I mean, this, I mean this, ah,-- you would-- and people from all over Florida came on pilgrimage to stand under this building. Now, the really good thing is that right next to the building is a carwash and if you go through the carwash you get a t-shirt of the building with Mary on it. Now, that is good. I mean, that is entrepreneurial, great, okay. And this is right next to Hubbard's place of worship. So, I am waiting to see if Cruise and Travolta go through the carwash.

00:55:10
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM What am I saying? That's a good question. I'm saying that if you look at the clientele that we treat, a sizeable percentage of them central to their story is some form of spirituality or religion and that we to be effective therapist need to be cognizant of that and to adapt our treatment accordingly. I have to have one additional observation before I turn it over to my colleague, Dr. Polster, and that is an apology. And the apology is that immediately after this, at 5:45, I have to exit to catch a limo at the front door of the Hilton at six o'clock. So, all of those people, those very young, attractive females, this bevy of beauties who want to take my picture, I want you to know that I'd been invited back to the next Evolution Conference and I will not change in those four years. Okay. In fact, as I mentioned in the previous group, I have actually come to characterize this conference as see-them-before-they-die. So, thank you for your attention and interest. 

00:56:35

00:56:40
ERVING POLSTER You will have time for the discussion, eh? 

00:56:45
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Huh? 

00:56:45
ERVING POLSTER You will have time for the discussion? 

00:56:45
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Well, take-- see how long you take. 

00:56:50
[sil.] 

00:56:55
ERVING POLSTER Well, ah, I know that I can see well but there's no light so-- but I've got to tell you... 

00:57:00
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Hang on. Let's make sure you're loud enough. I don't want them to miss your wisdom. 

00:57:05
ERVING POLSTER Oh, my mike isn't working, is it? 

00:57:05
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Huh? 

00:57:05
ERVING POLSTER It's not working. 

00:57:05
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Can we turn off his mike? Okay, hang on. Imagine you're landing airplanes at LAX. Okay, and they're coming in runway and, Erv, they don't wanna miss anything so try it now. 

00:57:20
ERVING POLSTER I'm enthralled already. Is it okay now? Can you hear me? 

00:57:25
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Yeah. Yeah. 

00:57:25
ERVING POLSTER Well, I've gotta tell you God has a tough act to follow. 

00:57:35
[sil.] 

00:57:40
ERVING POLSTER But then I also gotta tell you Donald Meichenbaum is a tough act to follow but I'm gonna follow him and I think that's what we're commissioned to do as psychotherapists to follow the lessons that God might teach us. Not that I have any relationship to God although I grew up religious, quite religious, but I have no relationship with God in this time of my life and for most of my adult life. Nevertheless, I have total-- that's an exaggeration, not total but I have great respect for the belief in God and particularly as it may represent probably one of the greatest achievements of poetry in the history of human beings. That God represent so much in our lives that it's a concentrate imagery that goes beyond our immediate existence and caters to this internal need to relate to the rhythm between the self that we experience and the world that we intuit is out there and then-- into which we belong. So, we have to find some way as psychotherapists not to think in terms of whether God is competitor to our system in terms of whether we believe in supernaturalism or not, I think it's quite true what Donald had said that it doesn't matter what you believe in your own mind about whether God or does not exist. The people you're working with, it's our business as therapists to take account of their needs and their per-- perspectives and what will help them and surely, if they have a belief in God that is an asset to the psychotherapy. I remember in my earlier days, working specially in the early days, when I am working with somebody who is difficult then I felt there were some risk involved in their lives in terms of whether they would, ah, make bad decisions or commit suicide or go off on a psychotic tangent or whatever it would be, and if they would tell me something about their churchly membership and their participation in the churches, I was relieved. What an ally, that I was not alone in working with this person, that there's a community out there and there was a co-- a cosmic significance, all that will be, uhm, ah, an instrumentation of the sense of, of life, the sense of conti-- continuity that this person required. So, okay, I, I think that's a very important aspect of what we do to be able to incorporate the interest and the needs of the people and if religion is their interest and their need to be able to incorporate into the therapy. What I have some difficulty with is the implication that when we run into trouble, we farm it out to religion. Like, why don't we have something like that? Why don't we have situations in which people can go for comfort or, ah, co-- communal, ah, interaction or a sense of solidity of harder living, ah, a sense of exploration of what matters in their lives and so on and so I think that we are in a sense the heirs of religion, we psychotherapists, and that's something that has been a, ah, point of disagreement in the psychotherapy field ever since Freud who was so antagonistic toward the religions that he did not feel that he was modifying them. He feels like he was conquering them. Whereas Jungian, on the other hand, believed in some of the less tangible aspects of his work and though he was not oriented toward Christianity, did believe in the role of religion in people's lives. But what are some of the lessons that we would get from, ah, if we learn from God. Like, for example, when I was listening to Do-- to Donald, for most of the session I could have just sort right out of my chair. I mean, he was stirring me beyond what I would normally find instructive in a pedagogical mode and we, of course, are here primarily for pedagica--pedagogical purposes and yet his way of talking to you was more like a Down Home minister... 

01:03:05
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM No, Rabbi. 

01:03:10
ERVING POLSTER Rabbi. Ah, exactly. 

01:03:10
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Please, ah, I don't mean to interrupt you. Just a little correction. 

01:03:15
ERVING POLSTER Okay, thanks for the correction. I, I remember one time, my father came up to me, I was a grown man but I still live in Cleveland so I was, ah, I'm-- I was under, under si-- under 50 or 60-- I don't know, anyway it doesn't matter. He came to me o-- he came to me one day and he said to me, "Erving, don't you think that I'm your keeper you should go to schule?" And I put my arm around him which you don't usually do with my father but I did it anyway. I said, "Dad, I'm in the business myself and I'm gonna be okay," and that satisfied him. Anyway, where was I? I tend to lose track. Uhm, okay, so w-- what is it that God offers? Well, first of all, there's a kind of halo effect that hallows authority, instruction, understanding, transcendence, and all of those factors that we commonly associate with God in which we human beings try to emulate but we fall short. But I don't think it's a terrible thing to fall short. We can make up for it. I mean, I'm not saying that people who believe in God shouldn't, I'm only saying people who believe in God have that belief and that has very important healing purposes as Donald was saying. Shall I call you Donald or Dr. Meichenbaum? 

01:05:05
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM No. Just Rabbi. Anything you want. 

01:05:15
[sil.] 

01:05:25
ERVING POLSTER I lose my play so easily. Somebody cue me in. 

01:05:30
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Trans... 

01:05:35
UNKNOWN You can't stretch with the Rabbi. 

01:05:35
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM No, the transcendent. 

01:05:35
ERVING POLSTER Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, the, the, the halo thing. Okay. So, w-- what I'm saying is people in believe in God and, and that, and that is a healing phenomenon, it obviously is, it has many drawbacks in terms of a cultural, ah, norm particularly in terms of, ah, encouraging, ah, ah, very strange beliefs that have no support or whatever and that, ah, way out of touch with what could possibly be true and I won't go in all of that. But the basic errors of superstition that, that, ah, poison the society even though it's, ah, it's a ill wind that blows no good and there are many goods that come out of it nevertheless, there are evils that come out of this superstitious obedience to that which is unsupportable. But can we incorporate some of that into our work as therapist? Like for ex-- for example, I remember one time I was working with a woman who called me and she was in a-- in, in a of anxiety and I talk with her on the phone, she was about to leave town. And she was leaving town and she was in the state of anxiety and she called me and so I was talking with her. Right, after we're done talking on the phone she felt much better and she said, ah, "Well, but what's gonna happen when I'm gone and you're not there?" So, I said, "Well, when you're there, just imagine me and imagine having a conversation to me-- with me and what I would say." Now, that's an incorporation of fantasy but it's close to reality in terms of her interpretations of what could possibly be true and many therapists would-- there was a-- all you're doing is encouraging dependency. I didn't encourage dependency, I encourage dependability. She was no more dependent, she was less dependent because of what we did and she would have been going there and then finding me a dependable source of whatever support she needed at that time. But I think we have to be very careful not to allow ourselves to be so-- I wanna use the word "humble" but that's too lovely a word to use for it and I think humi-- "humility" is a beautiful trait. But if we-- in our human proportions don't understand that we have transcendent effect not because of our, necessarily, our personalities but because of the setting in to which the people have come. An arrangement of the time and the space and the frame of mind to deal with things that are not just of the moment but are, are representative of a lifetime of experience, it's a very compelling phenomenon. I saw-- I walked in, in-- toward the end of the session before this one and Jeffrey Zeig was doing a hypnosis, ah, induction or demonstration and one of the things he said when he asked her to close her eyes, this woman he was wor-- he was working with, he said, "Just imagine the space beyond-- behind your eyes. Your eyes are closed. Imagine space behind." Okay, I don't know what that did to her because they didn't go into that but I know that in my own sense when I... 

01:09:45
[sil.] 

01:09:50
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM I was the discussant on that and I'm-- I was the discussant on Zeig and I'm still behind my eyes. I have no idea what that meant at all. Ah, though-- that he's told this woman to look behind her eyes. Yeah, yeah. Please tell them. 

01:10:05
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Okay. Oh, yeah. Okay, well, to me, if, if I close my eyes in a meditative mode and I think these are probably through a large range of meditation, when I feel the sensations underneath my visual potential and I have my close, it opens up a kind of space free experience that I-- I won't say that when I do it I normally think of the world at large but there is a quality of entering into, ah, a space free experience into which you are embedded. And I think meditation very often creates that kind of phenomenon that you were encased in a specific focus but you always feel a ground of, ah, kind of a vibratory sensation that is, uhm, without content and may or may not be interesting to you but it's something that goes on as part of the context. And I-- all the-- one of the points that I wanna make is that there's something about coordinating anything that you experience with the context of the, ah, of life and the context of life includes the, the, ah, immediate context like family or city or government or-- and further universe and you could extend it into the concept of God and that satisfies the evil. But the point I wanna make is that many needs, you know,-- I've, ah, I've written about this, I haven't published it, probably nobody's gonna publish it but anyway it's about what-- i-- it's about what God does for people that psychotherapist also do and don't realize they're doing the same thing. Now, I won't go into all that now because that will be a whole another ball game. But I do wanna emphasize the point of taking seriously that we are the heirs of, ah, religion, the heirs of spirituality and that we should honor our ancestors as still relevant along many dimensions and the people that Donald is referring or responding to in relation to their spirituality are coming from that position. A very valid position from the standpoint of what they're dealing with and their troubled circumstances and that is important to honor it. Okay. 

01:12:55
[sil.] 

01:12:55
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM I'm going to conclude with the best joke I heard this week. It's about a spiritual journey that Jean Houston started her talk off with. I don't know if any people were here. So, there's Jewish woman, she goes through her travel agent and she says to her travel agent, "I have to go on this long trip to find the Sufi who is going to give beliefs and I need this very much." And the travel agent said, "You can't go there." 

01:13:30
ERVING POLSTER She can't what? 

01:13:30
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM She, she can't go on this trip. It, it, it, it's too oppressive. She had to take a plane then she had to take a bus and then she had to go up a hike. You know, it's, it's beyond you, okay. She says, "I must go." So she goes on this spiritual journey and she's on the spiritual journey and she gets to the mountain where the Sufi lives. 

01:13:55
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

01:13:55
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM She climbs this mountain and the assistant comes out and says, "You wanna see the Sufi?" "Yes, I must see the Sufi." "Well, if you see the Sufi, you could only say three words. You got that? Three words and nothing more." "I schlep all this way to see the Sufi, the trip, all the stuff I went through and I only got three words? Okay. I'll take it." She goes in to see the Sufi, she says, "Morris, come home." I'll see you all in four years, thank you.
