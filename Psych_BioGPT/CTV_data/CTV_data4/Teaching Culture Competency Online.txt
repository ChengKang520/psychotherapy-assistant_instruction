HELEN NEVILLE Well, welcome everybody and it's a small group for us today. But it is my honor to introduce our last invited speaker for the round table. And, and Jordan, this is my last official activities roundtable director. So I'm honored that it's for you. Jordan and I go way back, we were, we were colleagues here together in T.C and he's also a graduate from the Clinical Psych Program in my department. So it's an honor to bring Jordan here. No matter fact umm… uh… Jordan was part of a conference a couple years ago, that inspired me to put this is the thing for us this year. He was at the Education Leadership Conference in A.P.A. sponsored by the education directorate that looked at educational issues within the digital sphere. So I walked, I went to the entire conference completely blown over realizing "Oh! My gosh. This is a whole area of knowledge." I'd like us to really get our game up and so hence the, this thing, and so it's my honor to introduce Dr. Wright because he was one of the invited speakers for that. And umm… he brings a great deal of experience. So just a few words on umm… Jordan and his accomplishments, and I will be formal with Dr Wright and all that sort of thing. Umm… Dr Jordan Wright is an academic, the academic coordinator for psychology at the Center for Distance Learning at Empire State, State University of New York. That's right here, right? Yeah. Uh… he earned his Ph D. as I was saying in clinical psychology uh… Columbia University. He's a diplomat in, of the American Board of Assessment Psychology and Fellow of the Society for personality assessment. He oversees the online psychology curriculum for the college and designs, for the college and designs the online offerings. He is the author of uh… conducting psychological assessment, a guide for practitioners, and co-author of the sixth edition of the handbook of psychological assessment. Dr Jordan Wright's research focuses primarily on minorities stress, micro aggressions and identity of personality within the LGBT cue community. He's the author of the homonegative, microaggressions scale and he designs and delivers Microaggression trainings throughout secondary and higher educational context. And I believe in another life, he's been a theater performer too. So long ago, but he brings wonderful capabilities as a speaker. So it's my joy to introduce Dr Wright, thank you.

JORDAN WRIGHT Umm… so I'm going to talk about a model particularly in multicultural competence to counseling students online, to counseling social work students uh… clinical psych students. Umm… it's an area that has not been researched all that well. The theory is not great behind it. It, it's so new and for whatever reason, our field is a little bit behind in this area as, as uh… Dr Neville saying we had uh… the Education Leadership Conference a couple years ago, was on umm… psychology in the digital age. And it was amazing, how far behind our field is compared to many other fields. Umm… so I'm going to be talking about teaching multicultural uh… competence online multicultural counseling skills and competencies online uh… which a lot of programs have shied away from because it sounds like it shouldn't work, and it shouldn't, but maybe it can. Umm… so this is a definition. I don't have to tell this audience, but the idea of uh… behind multicultural counseling is preparation and practices that integrate multicultural and culture, culture-specific awareness, knowledge, and skills into counseling interactions. this is sort of a tried and true definition of uh… multicultural competence in counseling. Umm… what's important for us is the two things. One is multicultural stuff and culture-specific stuff. And the stuff is awareness knowledge and skills and at the base of multicultural education is understanding your own values and biases. This has been a hallmark of multicultural education and cultural competence education within the counseling sphere. What's been added to this for a full uh… sort of more rounded curriculum of multicultural competence is understanding the client's worldview and interventions from each of these perspectives, from an awareness, a multicultural awareness, a cultural knowledge and a cultural skills perspective. This is a pretty common model used in the development of more traditional uh… multicultural courses. Over the years, I'm not exactly clear on this, but over the years it's switched from awareness to attitudes. Probably, from some of the research that shows that awareness is not enough. Uh… you need to have sort of positive a multicultural uh… attitudes toward diversity when and when in a counseling situation, awareness of culture is just not enough. Umm… we're going to come back to this model a little bit later and how an online program can address this model specifically. When it comes to multicultural counseling online like I said not much has been done in this arena. There's, there's not much going on out there. There are some programs who are doing Cultural psychology online. You know, more umm… content driven courses less skills based. There are a few out there her doing skills based courses online. I'll talk about a few of the online skills courses that I've done a little bit later. Umm… but not much and certainly not much that's actually researched and, and studied. Umm… there's been some research showing that online content, this is websites, this is videos on You Tube, this is online forums where we can reach out worldwide umm… can be very valuable in the gaining of knowledge and awareness of different cultural groups. It is much easier now on the World Wide Web to reach out and get information, some bad, but a lot of good. Umm… about specific cultures it's a lot easier now than it used to be. When it comes to Web-based or online multicultural education, not much has been done in our field, but a little bit has been done in the pre-service field for K-12 teachers'. Umm… there's, there's one study, there's one research team that's a looking at and comparing an online version of multicultural training for teachers to a traditional training uh… for four multicultural issues in teaching. So they are doing skills. Obviously, it's different skills then we would do in counseling, but they are doing skills, they are doing awareness, they're doing similar things that we're doing it. They have a look specifically comparing the two models. And they found a couple of really interesting things. First of all, they found that students were actually more enthusiastic and willing to discuss 'thorny' multicultural issues online or something a little safer online, when you're not fully exposed in the classroom. There's also when it comes to online education when we use asynchronous discussions, so discussions that happen not with everybody there at the same time, but people posting and then responding to posts. There's something very comfortable about being able to think through and edit your response. That's a little different than if you were in a class and have to take that risk of raising your hand. There is benefit to taking that risk and I don't want to minimize that. There are benefits and there are drawbacks to doing this online, but one of the things they did find is that people were actually more interested in some of the, the trickier multicultural issues in the online version of the course. What I found interesting is that there were more equitable discussions and interactions among students of different cultural backgrounds in the online version of the course. What they found is that both in quality and quantity of what was being said, there is more equity amongst what was being said between different cultural groups within the class. And there was less cultural isolation and less dominance by students from particular cultural group in the online version. You know I can speak from experience when you're teaching multicultural counseling or cultural psychology or any of that, when I teach about microagressions, certain groups in the room feel much more confident speaking up. I know in, in my more traditional education when it wasn't about culture that obviously, went to the more dominant groups, that went to meet a white man in the room very much more comfortable. When I've taught these more multicultural topics, specific minority groups feel a lot more empowered to speak about some of these issues and actually it's uh… majority groups who take a backseat in a lot of these discussions. That's not saying about across the board, but what they found was that in these online discussions, there was less isolation umm… there were fewer students who were, you know, sort of marginalized within the context of the actual room, umm… and again more equity across the different groups and across the different students. So the assumption is based on this, could this be a less threatening environment for multicultural discourse? Could this be a more comfortable environment for doing some of this work than person? Again I don't want to minimize the in person because the bulk of the counseling we do is in persons. So we need to be able to have these difficult discussions in person as well, and we'll talk about how on in online uh… curricula you can have synchronous components as well, whether video chats or you know there is face to face. But in general, could this be a good way of opening people up a little bit more a little bit faster? Because we have limited time in training, right? We don't have forever to get into this. I don't have three years to open up a student to being willing to talk about this stuff. I need, you know, in that semester, in that two semester series of courses to be able to do this. So I'm gonna present a Self-Regulation Model for Multicultural Education Online. Umm… that was to sort of justify that this can work and maybe a good thing to look into. Next I'm going to present sort of a model and I'm presenting this I'll present it pretty quickly because I want to hear thoughts, I want to hear your reactions to it, I want to hear uh… some of your experiences and have a little bit more of a discussion about it. So this is based in Social Cognition Theory. It's uh… adapted from uh… this Multicultural Competence Training Model in K-12 pre-service. Umm… it has been adapted because it kind of needs to be. But there are four main phases the observation phase, the emulation phase, the self control phase and the self regulation phase. Umm… there's an emphasis in online education of self-regulation. Umm… and this would apply, this would work in a more traditional setting, this model would work in a traditional classroom setting. The reason that it's specific, I'm specifically talking about it in terms of an online uh… program is because in online education there's a certain degree of self directedness necessarily. Unless, you are treating it like an online class where you meet via Skype at the prescribed time and you're just pretending it's a real class, uh… a traditional class. Umm… unless you're doing that, if you're doing asynchronous discussions, if you're doing web-based content, if you're doing these things, there's an assumption that there is a self-regulation and self motivation happening in the training which is why this model I think applies specifically to online education. So in the observation phase students observe the instructor or teaching assistants or however it's built umm… having successful counseling interventions with diverse uh… constituencies with diverse clients, clients and groups. So they observe these more successful interactions. And you talk aloud, the instructor would talk aloud about his or her cultural assumptions, biases, values, and how they affect the situation. This is a modeling situation. So we want our students and our counselors, our future psychologists, we want them to be thinking this in their head. We want them to be thinking, what are my cultural assumptions? What are my biases? How am I, my stuff? How's my stuff impacting this counseling situation, right now? So the modeling is the instructor doing that and doing it explicitly, doing it out loud. The emulation phase is when we start doing dyads, that's when we start doing role players umm… within the class. So that they start to emulate some of those successful interactions, they start thinking aloud again about these assumptions, about these biases and get feedback from the peer, from their peers and from the instructor. Obviously, this is key. When you're trying to emulate the instructor the successful interactions, you're not going to be 100% successful and you're not going to know what you don't know. You're not going to know all the mistakes that you've made. You're not going to, you know, realize in the moment, what's happened. We all know this, if we've been in dyads in a class. That feedback from a T.A or an instructor, from your peers is super important in understanding my role in the counseling situation. Self-control is making these skills more automatic. So in those moments, am I automatically thinking about my biases? Am I automatically using language that is less culturally specific? Am I using language that is less gender bias? Am I using language? Can I make that automatic? And this takes a lot of practice. This is why it's, you know, this becomes very self-motivated and self-regulated because this takes a lot of work outside of the class, uh… outside of the classroom in a traditional uh… face to face class. It takes sort of practice on your own. This is also the phase where you build up your knowledge. You build up your knowledge about specific cultures. If you're working with somebody from a specific cultural background, you do your homework, you learn about that culture, you learn about assumptions about that culture, you learn about stereotype threats that may play a part in their behavior. You, you learn all these things. You practice your skills and then you compare your own efforts to that model, right, the instructor, during the observation phase that you saw. You compare your own effectiveness in these counseling situations. And then self-regulation, self-regulation, in self-control we made things more automatic. In self-regulation, we learned to adapt. We learned to take these skills and adapt them to different situations. We're not going to be able to predict every single counseling situation that you will ever come into contact with. So you need to learn these skills and be able to adapt to them as needed to different situations. This is the self-regulation phase. You need to not only learn but become automatic, but you need to learn which ones to apply at which moments. And this takes a lot of practice with clients in quotes which are volunteers from outside the class, sort of the naive volunteer who doesn't know this stuff and doesn't know what's going on. Real clients uh… very often the uh… students that I'm training in these issues are already on a placement. They're already out there working with real clients. So practicing this with them, and across contexts, so in a university training clinic as well as an expert in ship as well, you know, we need to be able to self regulate which skills we use in which context with which people, easy right? Then probably, the most important part of this model is self reflection is key to the entire process. Self reflection ongoing self reflection is necessary for understanding where are my gaps? Where do I need to practice more? Where do I need to apply these things? So that I can learn to apply them a little bit better and more easily than I am now. Who am I having trouble working with? This is a question that's always tough for us to answer. It's one that I push. And my students answer, it's when I push myself to answer, who do I have difficulty working with? And why is that? What is it? What am I bringing? What is my crap that I'm bringing to the situation that is making it harder for me to work with these certain people that self reflect of part is really important. So this model ends up looking like this in a very simplistic form. Obviously, it becomes much more complex and the arrows go every which way, but that makes an ugly slide. So there you go, here's my model. Umm… so but the key is that self-regulation. Uh… sorry the self-reflection goes throughout all, of the model. Now I'm going to talk about online components when it comes to each phase of this model. So the observation phase:the videotaped interactions with the instructor. This actually allows the instructor a lot more control over the interaction than if you were doing it live in a class. There's something very, very exciting and you know, you've turned the heat up, if it's alive in class and you're seeing that interaction happen in real time. At the same time, there's something very nice about being able to take another take. Take three, take four, right. And say "Oh, that didn't really illustrate what I wanted to illustrate." I as an instructor to make sure I'm working in the skills that I want to show them. And so I can videotape it. I can fix that videotape. I can edit that videotape until, it really illustrates the points that I wanted to illustrate. More importantly, I can use voiceover technology or umm… text technology over the recordings. So I can have a recording of myself doing a counseling session and then I can pause myself mid-sentence and do a voiceover. Uh… here's what I was thinking in this moment. Here's the bias that I really need to check myself on. Here's a word that I shouldn't have used in this moment. And here's why I used it. Or you can use text across the bottom in sort of in more in real time and say "Here's, what I'm doing in this moment." This works really well in uh… sort of more basic counseling skills classes because you can write at the bottom reflection or paraphrase or some of these skills that you're trying to illustrate. It's a little tougher in the multicultural counseling trainings because you know, you don't want to put a little paragraph at the bottom that says 'bias- I grew up this way and this is why I think, you know." That becomes a little tedious for them to read and try and uh… but it can work, it can work and it, it offers an advantage over in person, in person in a class. Most often students will wait till the end of a role play. They may remember some of the things. They may not remember all of the things. They may comment on some of the things. I'm sure you've been in classes where the first comment that gets made spurs the conversation for the rest of the class. And maybe you don't get back to the other skills that you really wanted to uh… show off. Asynchronous discussions are very important in online education like I said, these are where you post a comment and then whenever the next student logs on, they see your comment, they respond to it. Usually, in you know, we, we push for responding in a scholarly way, not just like a thumbs up or alike. Umm… but sort of furthering that thinking and deepening that thinking, this is really important during the observation phase. We really want to encourage students to make comments on what they see - "Woo! That was great, I liked when you did this." That would be hard for me to say. That doesn't come naturally to me. And then the instructor can jump back in and say "You don't need to say it like me, find your own way of saying." You know, these asynchronous discussions become very important in deepening these observations. For the emulation phase umm… you can do and I, I'm doing this now. I'm doing a synchronous online uh… skills course where uh… we have technology to sort of being in the classroom to me. Umm… so actually students are in Staten Island and like Uduka and I'm in a little sort of closet office uh… down in Soho and where my office is, but I've got giant screens in front of me. And I see them, they see me, we here, I control their camera, I control my camera. And so we can do dyads, we can do very traditional dyads in this way. In addition to that though videotaping interactions is very powerful for two reasons. One, sort of the same thing is the observation phase. I'm not going to miss as much, if it's videotaped and I can rewind and see that again. I'm, I'm, I as an instructor and not going to miss as much. I'm going to hone in on certain things. I am able to say at 1:13 seconds. Look at the way the client reacted when you said this, right. I can point to this. The second, really important part of a videotape plays that students can see themselves, and if you've ever done this, I had to do this in uh… a specific type of training of therapy. It's required that you videotape yourself and then watch yourself and it's painful. I will never watch this video. I hate listening myself talk. I hate watching it, I don't want to do it. It's painful, but it's really, really transformative in understanding who you are as a therapist, what your voice really sounds like what you did in a moment that you didn't realize that you did. It's very important for you to be able to see that, so videotaped interactions are really useful for this emulation phase. Again this asynchronous discussion can help peers give feedback. The, the students who did the videotaped interaction could post that interaction and write. Here's where I had trouble and the peers can say "Oh, I couldn't tell that you were nervous at that point." or "Oh, yeah I could tell." Maybe think of doing it this way, we can have these asynchronous discussions. More importantly, though the online platform allows for both public and private feedback, so I as an instructor may decide "Woo, this is good for everyone to hear." When you're approaching a situation like this, think about doing it this way. I may as an instructor also decide, you know what, this student is really struggling in some area that I don't want to make public, I don't want to call it out in front of the group, like I might be in a face to face class. This is sort of the equivalent of saying "See me after class." Where I can send, I can shoot off an email or I can set up a phone call to discuss something a little bit more privately. I have more control over what is public and what is private in the online uh… forum. The self control phase remembering that the first step is increasing your knowledge base, and this is where online content becomes really, really useful. So if you or your placement are working with somebody from Haiti and, and you need to learn more about that and you're going to go online, you're going to start looking at what you need to learn about Haitian culture about umm… Immigration of Haitians, all this stuff, you're gonna, you're gonna look that up online, so that you can increase your cultural, culture-specific knowledge base. Then we're going to use structured asynchronous discussions to enhance skills. So these structured discussions are gonna ask you to reflect on your own skills, reflect on what's coming easily to you, what's not. We're a little bit more structured in some of these because this is a leader phase, right. This is uh… we want to really turn up the volume on you working on yourself. So we use these asynchronous discussions to deepen our skill set. And then we use self assessment and comparison to the model to the, you know, that first observation phase model. So we, we use some form of assessing yourself and your own videotape. You have now emulated, now in the self-control phase, what's coming more easily to you as you look at the progression of your videotapes? Umm… very often I will say, you know, you have to do one videotape a week and then six weeks then I'll ask them to watch all six videotapes and tell me how they've progressed, right. That's making things more automatic which is the goal of this phase. In the self regulation phase is you know, again we're, we're gonna use these umm… videotaped interactions with volunteers, the naive volunteers, not classmates. Umm… when possible, I'd like to ask them to videotape actual interactions. This is uh… sort of the nicer equivalent to writing process notes or you know, a transcript of a whole session like if you can videotape a session with a real client, we can actually see what's going on in real life. And then we asked for structure feedback from peer's the instructor and supervisors. We don't want to forget that we have a resource in placement supervisors. I say structured feedback because this is not general feedback about the counseling skills. This is, this is specific to cultural issues in counseling. So we ask for very structured feedback. Finally self reflection, journaling activities are awesome for this. Right, asking them to maintain a journal, helps them self reflect, helps them, we can give them prompts as we go, as we see where we expect them to be, we don't have to. It depends on sort of help self-motivated they are, how clear they are, umm… but this becomes very important throughout every single phase. So I want to revisit this model. Umm… I want to revisit this model and think about it. Umm… now that we have a model for doing this online, I want to think about some specific online tools and where they can help us. Online Content, this is again those web pages, those You Tube videos, umm… forums, chats, anything that you can find online that's not part of the class, counts as online content. It's a lot of stuff. This is really mostly aimed at knowledge. Umm… this is mostly aimed at understanding your own culture that's the knowledge of values and biases, understanding your own culture, and how that affects you, understanding uh… the knowledge in the client's worldview umm… is knowledge about their specific culture. So knowledge about what mental health looks like in their culture, what mental illness it's like in their culture that kind of stuff. Knowledge about interventions, the knowledge about interventions, this is the idea that we have a lot of knowledge about the generic skills of counseling. We know what works generically. This knowledge is about when this is clash this clash-cultural, when these generic skills maybe not align with the culture of the person that you're working with. And then skills, skills under clients' world view what this means is umm… understanding the research behind what specific interventions have been shown to be effective for a specific population. Umm… so we can look this stuff up online. We can go to journal articles. We can look online for a lot of this material that knocks out four, already we're done. Asynchronous Discussions - asynchronous discussions are a hallmark of online education. There's something that are, they're much harder to do in a traditional class. Umm… I do a lot of blended umm… which is, you know, where we meet as a class in person to do some of the work, and then we have online discussions and online work for part of the class as well. I do, I do that. And what's really important is to understand where can we really benefit from the online uh… form of doing this work? So this is great for attitudes, right. If you've ever taken uh… umm… sort of a culture lab or one of these classes where it's very confrontational and they turn up the heat on purpose, right, to help you address. Some of your own biases and admit some of your own biases to your self, to others. It can be pretty threatening for students. Umm… it can be I, I took it long ago here and it was traumatic with a lower case T. Umm… it can be led to face these things. And it can be, you know, pretty tough. The, I'm not saying it shouldn't be, I'm not saying that tough is necessarily bad. But asynchronous discussions can offer us maybe a slightly (inaudible ) approach safer, safer feeling, way of doing it a less risky way of looking at our own attitudes. Umm… so our own values and biases the attitudes. Here, this is about understanding how my culture has influenced my own attitudes and values and biases, the attitudes about the client's worldview is when I have specific umm… reactions to certain cultures to people from certain cultures. Umm… interventions same sort of thing like where am I accidentally betraying some of my attitudes in my interventions. So feedback to videotape plays in these asynchronous discussions can really call me on some of that, and say at minute two and a half, you reacted in a certain way that I don't think, I would have. What does that say that's looking at attitudes as they have to do with interventions? Am I unconsciously betraying some of my values biases, believes in the way that I'm actually interacting, in a way that I would never have known had someone not been able to stop, rewind, scrutinize that one moment and then tell me about it and the knowledge as well, these asynchronous discussions are really good about deepening our knowledge about our own values and biases umm… as well. The last one I'm going to is the videotape role plays with asynchronous feedback. Again, we're really, we're, this is great at looking at the attitudes toward a specific uh… toward people of a specific cultural background, umm… Cultural Heritage. Umm… we can see these, we can see behaviorally. Things that make us question. Things that make our eyebrows raise and say "Ah! That's not how I would have done it." Let's think about why you're doing it this way. And of course, these videotapes plays are all about skills as well, umm… skills in understanding my own limitations umm… the skills under own values and biases about is about understanding my own limitations as a, as a counselor. Umm… so I can't do everything, there will be people I have limitations working with. And I'm just got a referral to do a umm… nurture how this applies, but it's a limitation of mine to do a uh… an evaluation, an educational evaluation with a student who just moved here and doesn't speak English very well. I have limited skills in this area. I do not speak her home language. I cannot do this evaluation. I'm scrambling to find somebody who can. And then skills in terms of interventions and this is again, do you know umm… interventions that are useful? Can you adapt all the skills that we've been using in a culturally appropriate way? Specifically, to the person sitting across from you, who brings with him or her cultural heritage, a gender or race and ethnicity or religion who brings with him or herself, all of this stuff. Can you adapt and this is when the self-regulation phase becomes very important. We've taught you a whole ton of skills, but can you apply the right skill at the right moment to the right to the person that you're working with? And these videotaped role-plays offer us an opportunity to really scrutinize that, to scrutinize that maybe even more than live dyads, right. The live dyads or you know, post talk supervision, when you go to your supervisor and just talk about what happened, you're omitting stuff, sometimes on purpose and most often not. That supervisor is that is at a disadvantage because he or she cannot see what's happening to these videotaped role-plays and then the, the subsequent asynchronous discussion can really help you delve into these issues. That is my model. So I, I want to invite you to share some reactions or thoughts or feelings that you might be having about this. Umm… I don't know, if any of you are doing any online education, taking courses or teaching courses online, and how you think this might translate, I'm curious. 

00:34:15
UNKNOWN So the only problem I have with asynchronous discussion that I'm taking an online course right now. It almost at times felt forced which was then, you know, you just get you have minimum requirements, and then you get over that. If somebody ask you a question you're like "I'm done with my requirement. Should I respond?" 

00:34:30
JORDAN WRIGHT Yeah.

UNKNOWN So at time that feels force, but that's at the same time completely review the fact that it is more structured, and you can see a lot of things that you wouldn't seen as person. 

00:34:35
JORDAN WRIGHT Yeah, so asynchronous discussions absolutely can feel forced. Umm… when I help people design online uh… courses, whether skills or even just content courses umm… I really challenge them to try and make the discussion prompts meaningful. That's how we get pass that. When it's a discussion, just to have a discussion or just to prove that you've read the material or something like that then it becomes, you know, a requirement to get through. I will tell you in a lot of the classes that I designed, it does say you have to post your main post, respond to at least three other people, respond to everybody who responds to your main post like there's a whole bunch of requirements. Again, it becomes very forced. I think at this level, right, once we get where we're doing this at the graduate level, right. We're not really doing this type of work at an undergraduate level. Umm… but when you're, when you're doing this with graduate students who want to actually become counselors, who actually want to do therapy with people, umm… as long as we are careful about our problems and make them meaningful, I found people really engaged. Umm… but you're absolutely right, if you, if you put the wrong prompt, if I put on there like using the readings that you had this week, think through how you might respond to this fake case like then it becomes a requirement. When it becomes about you posted this, you better defend yourself, you better tell me where your weaknesses are like I, I want you to list three places where your biases gotten the way in this 10 minute interaction. And if you can't locate free, I'm going to invite the rest of your peers to look at them for you like these sorts of things make it more meaningful, and that super important, is a great point. 

00:36:20
[sil.] 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN I, so I have a question for you and it's somewhat different than what you're talking about, but it kind of fits in the same vein. Uh… so I work in university umm… Marquette University in Milwaukee and uh… some of my colleagues and we uh… create this program very similar to a safe zone called Diversity advocates to uh… prompt people, uh… to learn more of these skills, actually allow that same cultural competency skills that we learned in counseling programs, but other units on campus. 

00:36:55
JORDAN WRIGHT Yeah. 

00:37:00
UNKNOWN And we kind of broke it up into two units, you know, so there is that time for some of them, you know, so that piece, it would be helpful in many ways to put it in tune (inaudible ) forum uh… because it's hard to chorale everybody into that. I was just kind of curious like if you were going to uh… kind of make it in some sort of like that format for uh…yeah, not like an online, ongoing class, but to me like a two, two, you know, two shot or a one shot or… 

00:37:25
JORDAN WRIGHT Yeah. 

00:37:25
UNKNOWN How would you go about doing that? 

00:37:30
JORDAN WRIGHT So umm… if I were developing a program that, that were aimed at sort of broadening uh… umm… awareness and positive attitudes and maybe some skills, you know, I would, I would certainly focus not on the intervention side, I would focus more on the own values and biases, and maybe some of the client worldview stuff. That being said, if you have sort of a two shot deal, I would strongly encourage you to look at blended programming, look at the research behind blended programming because what you can do is depending on how far those two sessions are. You can have those two in-person sessions where you're really thinking through this stuff and struggling through this stuff and asking for people's uh… experiences with this stuff and that's great, but you can really use an online module in the middle to put some discussions in and really ask people to go on once a week. 

00:38:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:38:20
JORDAN WRIGHT And look at what we're asking and just post one thing or post, you know, it's a little different because they're not being graded, and then, you know. 

00:38:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:38:25
JORDAN WRIGHT You don't have the power that you have over a student to get them to do the work, but again, if you, if you balance out something that's meaningful, a meaningful prompt to them with something that's not burdensome. So again not asking them to do something crazy, and that's gonna take an hour of their time, but to go on and maybe watch a three minute video and react to it, or uh… maybe ask them after the first one where in your everyday life, do you see this playing out, and have them post that and react to it. And you can uh… what you'll find and this is all over the blended literature is that the next time you meet in person, it's transformed into a whole another monster rather a whole other monster. 

00:39:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:39:10
JORDAN WRIGHT Umm… it, it turns the volume up, it turns the heat up… 

00:39:15
UNKNOWN Huh-hmm. 

00:39:15
JORDAN WRIGHT …on that discussion because they've had time to really think about these and you've kind of forced them to think through it. In, in that kind of situation, you would have to set it up to send like a constant reminder to them, like every week, like "log on now, it's ready." 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:39:30
JORDAN WRIGHT "Please, log on. I'm begging you log on." Right. Because they're gonna forget, they're gonna go back to their everyday lives. When it comes to these sort of one shot or two shot trainings, this is the real problem, right. They can be as engaged as they want in the room, and they step out of there and they're back to their real life, and they are not learning to apply it. 

00:39:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:39:50
JORDAN WRIGHT So having them discuss in an online discussion how they're applying these things or how they're seeing them play out in real life, can help deepen the training that you're doing. 

00:40:00
UNKNOWN That helps, thank you. 

00:40:05
JORDAN WRIGHT Yeah. 

00:40:05
UNKNOWN I was wondering Jordan if umm… as I listened to your model which is really very, very provoking of a blended approach because of course, there's always a very important dynamics that occur with multicultural issues that are alive, so when you have somebody that's racially different right in front of you, but is a very different reaction, psychologically, emotionally. 

00:40:25
JORDAN WRIGHT Yeah. 

00:40:30
UNKNOWN It happens and then this I think always going to be essential, but that the model and the kind of techniques you're presenting are just excellent to integrate into the kind of face to face uh… approaches because exactly as you're saying some of the more specific and then everybody's on call to respond… 

00:40:45
JORDAN WRIGHT Huh-hmm. 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN … and there's I know, you know, I know that's one of the strengths of online uh… learning is that everybody gets the chance because they're required to, to respond whereas in a large group, it's only like the, you know, 10 or 15% of the extroverts that speak a lot, and then a few others might speak every now and again. So you know, I was really intrigued about the, the dual approach, you know. 

00:41:10
JORDAN WRIGHT I think, I think blended is ripe for this. No one's written on it, no one's written. Umm… but I think when we start to develop blended programming for multicultural competence, we really need to be planned full about it and, and mindful of where are the strengths of live interaction, where are the strengths of umm… online. So that we break it up in a very thoughtful and planful way. Umm… so that maybe we do videotape that day dyads before we do live dyads or maybe we do live dyads all the way through and leave the sort of more content stuff uh… more readings about culti, cultural competence and discussions online. I don't know. It hasn't really been written about. The, the one thing umm… that we don't like to talk about as educators is our own biases and our own styles as teachers. We remove a lot of that in the online platform. We remove a lot of that. I will own it, I'm an interrupt or I, I, when I'm teaching especially, skills classes, I carry a fake remote apparently and I say "I'm going to pause for a second." as if I'm actually pausing them and say something. And then I look and then I say "Okay, play again." and like let them keep going. So I interrupt them and that has its benefits because I can do some of that work that uh… happens that I might forget later, but it hasn't drawbacks as well, that is very particular to my style and some students may not react well to it. So we take not all of it, we don't lose the whole personality of the instructor in an online course, but we take out a specific amount of it when it comes to power in the room, right. I am a white male that's not going to change, I have to own that, I talk about it a lot when I'm an instructor because I have power culturally, I have power structurally because I'm evaluating them and giving them a grade. I carry with me a lot of power, I can remove a little bit of that in an online platform, just because I'm, it's, it's not so salient, it's not there in the room, my power is not as salient, it's still there and we can't get rid of it, and we don't want to get rid of it necessarily. Umm… but we do remove some of our own idiosyncrasies as teachers in the online. And this again may be a benefit of blended like maybe there are some things where I need to be a little bit more removed and let them discuss more because I get so enraged when they say things. And you know, when I, you know, if I get too heated and I'm, you know, more passionate about this than they are, it becomes problematic. So there may be things that I need to think about myself and I need to take a step back. So this is the perfect part to vote online whereas there's other part where you know, I, I really do want to see them play out some of these umm… racial situations in the room live or something like that, may be great in the live, of course, instead of blended study.
