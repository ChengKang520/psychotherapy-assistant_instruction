Three Approaches to Counseling: One Client, Three Approaches Three Approaches To Counseling With Allen E. Ivey 

00:00:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  This tape, Three Approaches to Counseling is concerned with demonstrating that more than one approach to counseling or interviewing can be use at a single client. Ah, if you were to ask a counselor or therapist what their theoretical orientation is, the chances are, they would say eclectic. Eclecticism and systematic eclecticism is a method whereby you choose the best from different theories. As you become more systematic in your eclecticism, you end up developing your own unique theory. I would suggest that you think about your own approach. I'd like to see the therapist or counselor have at least three different theories underneath his or her belt before meeting with the client. In this demonstration tape, I will be working with Sarah, a 32-year-old graduate student in Organizational Development. There'll be a few constraints in the tape and that we're in a television studio. I will be abbreviating things for demonstration purposes, and finally, ah, the non-verbals will be a little constricted because of necessary space in the studio. We hope you find this tape useful and interesting. Ah, I'll be interested in your reactions.

Interview One: Psychodynamic Dream Analysis 

00:01:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  I'm Allen. 

00:01:45
SARAH And I'm Sarah. 

00:01:45
ALLEN E. IVEY And in this tape we're, we're going to do some demonstration. First of all, as you know, Sarah, ah, psychodynamic dream analysis, I know you have a dream. Ah, but before we begin, ah, is it okay if we videotape this? 

00:02:00
SARAH Certainly. 

00:02:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. And one thing we, ah, as I've said before is that we'll look at the tape, if there's anything you want to edit, 

00:02:05
SARAH Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:02:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ah, we will. Ah, this is not a counseling or a therapy interview. This is really a demonstration session. As such, you may be a little more cooperative, I hope. Then, ah, 'coz we wanna make this fairly short to make the points we'd like to make... 

00:02:20
SARAH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:02:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and you've taken the course with me and you're pretty much aware of what's going to happen. (crosstalk) 

00:02:25
SARAH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:02:25
ALLEN E. IVEY We've worked together before. Is there anything you might wanna say before we start? 

00:02:30
SARAH No. I'm... (crosstalk) 

00:02:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:02:30
SARAH ...I'm comfortable. 

00:02:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Good. I'm relatively comfortable. Ah, how do you feeling about being here right now? 

00:02:35
SARAH  I'm feeling more relaxed. (crosstalk) 

00:02:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Good. (crosstalk) 

00:02:40
SARAH Uhm, just all the preparation has helped to make me feel more relaxed and... 

00:02:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Good. 

00:02:45
SARAH ...to put the television out of my mind and just... 

00:02:45
ALLEN E. IVEY So you're... (crosstalk) 

00:02:45
SARAH Be here. (crosstalk) 

00:02:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...very pretty much ready to roll. (crosstalk) 

00:02:50
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:02:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Good. So, let's begin. Ah, where, ah, as you, you've heard this question before. Some of the stuff we do in class. Ah, you did have a dream that you'd like to understand a little bit better. 

00:03:00
SARAH Yes. 

00:03:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Could you tell me about your dream, Sarah? 

00:03:00
SARAH Uhm, would you like me to just tell you what the dream was and its sequence? 

00:03:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yes. 

00:03:05
SARAH Okay. Uhm, where do I start? I dreamed that I was on, ah, a beach. (crosstalk) 

00:03:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:03:15
SARAH Ah, a very wide beach with ah, white, pure, finely-grained sand that was very hard-packed. 

00:03:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:03:25
SARAH And the och, ocean was very, very aqua blue with a lot of waves. 

00:03:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:03:30
SARAH But somehow the sound of the waves in the ocean was not present. Uhm, off to the back, about a hundred yards, there was a large forest... (crosstalk) 

00:03:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:03:40
SARAH With pine trees and, ah, very dark and green. 

00:03:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:03:45
SARAH Uhm, it was a nice sunny, warm day and I was there with, uhm, a woman... 

00:03:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:03:50
SARAH ...who appeared to be my friend, Pat, and my brother Charles. 

00:03:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:03:55
SARAH And we had a blanket and some books and a picnic basket. And we were walking on the beach finding a spot to, to ah, sit and have our picnic. There were a number of other people further down the beach... (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
SARAH And just as we were putting our things out on the sand, uhm, I noticed off in a distance two, I would say, emergency vehicles that were kind of the dark army green color. 

00:04:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:04:20
SARAH And they looked to me like army or police. And there was a flashing light and there was a loudspeaker saying to get off the beach as am, as soon as possible. And there was urgency in the man's voice on the record, on the, ah, loudspeaker, but they didn't say why. 

00:04:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:04:35
SARAH  And I remember all the people starting to get ready to get off the beach and my brother got his things together and left. 

00:04:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:04:45
SARAH And, my, my friend and I were trying to get (laughs) our shoes on. And suddenly, everything's, went into slow motion. It was as if I couldn't... 

00:04:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:04:55
SARAH ...move fast, very fast, and I was being very deliberate about putting my... (crosstalk) 

00:05:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:05:00
SARAH ...shoes on and collecting my things. And the next thing I became aware of was this wave of cold, 

00:05:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:05:10
SARAH ah, not too cold but cold enough to send a shock. 

00:05:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:05:15
SARAH Water hitting my feet and touching the edge of a book that I had with me. 

00:05:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:05:20
SARAH And, ah, I remember picking up all my things and moving up the beach, about ten feet. 

00:05:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:05:25
SARAH There, and that would be enough space to put all my things before the water... (crosstalk) 

00:05:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:05:30
SARAH ...came up. And just as I started to put my things down, the water came washing in and, and went up over my legs... 

00:05:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:05:35
SARAH  and up the beach. And I remember feeling annoyed that I couldn't get myself together fast enough. And gee, the water is coming in very fast and I, I turned around and looked for an avenue to get away from the water because it was coming up so fast. And uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:05:55
SARAH I remember the image of the blue water and the foam on the water and how fast the waves were coming in. They weren't tidal waves, though. (crosstalk) 

00:06:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:06:05
SARAH It was just like long waves that came up a long, flat... (crosstalk) 

00:06:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:06:05
SARAH ...beach. And, ah, that was about when my dream ended. 

00:06:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. Okay, ah, I get the pattern of the dream, the, coming comfortably with your friend, Pat, and Charles. Ah, I hear the, the waves going down on a lovely day. I hear a lot of bright colors and... 

00:06:30
SARAH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...with some good feeling. Then, the, the dark green, the emergency... 

00:06:35
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:06:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  and then the, the wave coming up hitting the book, ah, ah, your friends being there. And then, do they, is it, what were, you said they were, disappeared or they were, you're alone? 

00:06:50
SARAH My brother's, at, when we were asked to leave the beach, left... 

00:06:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:06:55
SARAH And I, I don't know how he left. 

00:06:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:06:55
SARAH But he was not there... 

00:06:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:06:55
SARAH  anymore. And, uhm, Pat was standing there but she never took... (crosstalk) 

00:07:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:07:05
SARAH ...a real role. She was just there, like a presence. 

00:07:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:05
SARAH Uhm, her face was not that clear to me, but the feeling of her was clear who it was. 

00:07:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:07:15
SARAH Uhm, most of my focus was on the water and, and getting myself together and the beautiful day and the... (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
SARAH Book. 

00:07:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And the book. 

00:07:20
SARAH  Uh hmm. 

00:07:25
ALLEN E. IVEY As you know, Sarah, one thing I'd like to do is focus on, ah, the clearest images of the dream. There are lots of different ways we could go. 

00:07:30
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:07:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And what do you see as the clearest images of the dream? 

00:07:35
SARAH  The clearest visual images... 

00:07:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:40
SARAH ...of the dream are the book and the water, and the coming water. 

00:07:45
ALLEN E. IVEY The book and, (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
SARAH Coming waves. 

00:07:45
ALLEN E. IVEY and coming waves. 

00:07:45
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:07:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, what about these clearest feelings associated? Deeper... (crosstalk) 

00:07:50
SARAH The... (crosstalk) 

00:07:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...feelings. 

00:07:50
SARAH ...clearest feeling was that, the, the shock of the water. 

00:07:55
ALLEN E. IVEY The shock of the water. (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
SARAH The way it just penetrated all the way through me and sent... (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
SARAH ...like an electric... 

00:08:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:08:00
SARAH current through me. So, 

00:08:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:08:05
SARAH Oh, this feels good. This is exhilarating and shocking but gee, it's coming in too fast. 

00:08:10
ALLEN E. IVEY So, in the book, we get the feelings of, ah, annoyance be, about it getting wet... 

00:08:15
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:08:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and with the wave, the feeling of exhilaration... 

00:08:20
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:08:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...electric, electricity. In spite of, I guess, what might seem to be danger. You didn't have, (crosstalk) 

00:08:25
SARAH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:08:25
ALLEN E. IVEY did you have a conscious feeling of danger with you? 

00:08:25
SARAH I didn't have any sense of danger until I started to realize that this... (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
SARAH ...was coming in really fast. 

00:08:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
SARAH And maybe faster than I could deal with. And definitely (laughs) faster than I can deal. Uhm, and my concern at that point was to get away... 

00:08:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:08:45
SARAH But to take my things with me and to keep what I had brought with me together. 

00:08:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm.- 

00:08:50
SARAH So that, that, those two issues were very... (crosstalk) 

00:08:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Take your... (crosstalk) 

00:08:50
SARAH  much there. (crosstalk) 

00:08:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...things with you and get away. 

00:08:55
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:08:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, there are different elements we could focus on. Ah, we could focus on the book. Ah, we could focus even way back early in the dream on the, ah, the blaring out from the army vehicles. 

00:09:05
SARAH  Uh hmm. 

00:09:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Evacuate the beach, ah, we could focus on, on the wave, I'd like to focus just on one element for the demonstration, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:09:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And by the way, this is what I would do anyway. I would focus on one thing first and then gradually add other elements to develop a more... 

00:09:20
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:09:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...integrated sense that you know. Ah, which element would you like to focus on? 

00:09:25
SARAH  Uhm, well, the wave appeals to me, although I, (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:09:35
SARAH I may have a clearer, maybe I should go with what feels like a clearer sense. 

00:09:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

00:09:40
SARAH Ah, just for the facilitation here. Uhm, so I would think I would focus on the wave and somehow how that relates to my things like the book... 

00:09:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:09:50
SARAH  and my shoes, just keep in that general area. 

00:09:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Your shoes, and yet, just tell a little about the shoes. (crosstalk) 

00:09:55
SARAH I was trying to put my shoes on to get off the beach... 

00:10:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Trying to put shoes on. (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
SARAH ...and that was why I was slow, taking such a long, long time... (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
SARAH ...to get off. 

00:10:05
ALLEN E. IVEY I see. (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
SARAH To move. 

00:10:05
ALLEN E. IVEY So that... (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
SARAH Just. (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...deliberate putting on the shoes, feeling as. (crosstalk) 

00:10:10
SARAH Right. (crosstalk) 

00:10:10
ALLEN E. IVEY What feeling did you have associated with the shoes? 

00:10:10
SARAH  It was almost like, uhm, there was no reason for it but it was just the order that had to be done... (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
ALLEN E. IVEY It. (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
SARAH And I was trying to follow my order. 

00:10:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  Follow the order. (crosstalk) 

00:10:25
SARAH So, it was a kind of a sense of obligation. 

00:10:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Obligation. 

00:10:25
SARAH Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:10:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Feeling of obligation. 

00:10:25
SARAH Duty, 

00:10:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  Shouldness. 

00:10:30
SARAH shouldness, right. That's a good of way of (laughs) saying it. 

00:10:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Sounds like I hit a nerve. 

00:10:35
SARAH Yes, (laughs), you did. 

00:10:35
ALLEN E. IVEY (laughs) Obligation, duty, shouldness. 

00:10:40
SARAH Uh-huh. 

00:10:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, with the book, the annoyance, and, any other feelings about the book? 

00:10:45
SARAH Well, the book was more than just, uhm, a, a novel or something. (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
SARAH It was, it was a longish book and it had leather corners that were tooled and... 

00:10:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:10:55
SARAH  uhm, kind of a, a light off-white center. 

00:11:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:11:00
SARAH I had the feeling that it was some kind of a personal book, either that it had some personal wisdom in it... (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
SARAH  or maybe it was a journal but I don't think I was gonna write on it. I think I was reading this, ah, it must have been, it might have been something I was reading about myself. 

00:11:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
SARAH Because I was very attached to it and I really want to take care of it. 

00:11:20
ALLEN E. IVEY So you were, the attachment(ph)... 

00:11:20
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:11:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...to the book. 

00:11:20
SARAH  Uh hmm. 

00:11:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And care, take care of it. 

00:11:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:11:25
ALLEN E. IVEY So there's a lot of richness in the book, too. 

00:11:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:11:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  And, so the feelings of ah, with the, ah, book are attachment, take care, annoyed when the waves got it. Those are some of the feelings... (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:11:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and then the feelings with, ah, ah, the shoes or the shouldness of the order. 

00:11:45
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:11:45
ALLEN E. IVEY And the feelings with the wave are electricity, sti, stimulation, excitement. Is that correct? (crosstalk) 

00:11:50
SARAH Uh hmm. Aliveness. 

00:11:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Aliveness. Okay. 

00:11:50
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:11:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Shouldness, aliveness, and the book? (crosstalk) 

00:11:55
SARAH Shouldness, aliveness, and a sense of myself or possession. 

00:12:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Sense of myself and possession. (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:12:05
ALLEN E. IVEY The book. Okay, I might just stop for a minute and just do a little processing, explain what I'm doing. 

00:12:10
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:12:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, is that I find it very useful in doing dream analysis is to sort out, typically, three, most often, I find in dreams, there tend to be three main elements. 

00:12:20
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:12:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, I also try to find the element and the feeling associated with the dream. And so, the drawing out of the facts about the dream and the feelings of the dream. 

00:12:30
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And to some extent, I've been using the microskill of summarization to try to keep a sense of Gestalt that talk about some of the other elements that are there. 

00:12:40
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:12:40
ALLEN E. IVEY If you want, we could go on for a long time looking at this dream, but we'll be looking predominantly just at one in this, in this dream analysis. Ah, the next thing I'm going to do is a technique called focused free association in which I'm gonna ask you to take one element. I guess you've select, already selected the waves. Is that still where you are? Ah, take one element. 

00:13:00
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:13:00
ALLEN E. IVEY You could name that (inaudible )... (crosstalk) 

00:13:04
SARAH I could go with the wave. Yes. 

00:13:05
ALLEN E. IVEY What, what would you like to go on? (crosstalk) 

00:13:05
SARAH Ah, you just happened to bring it up and it, it pushed a, pushed a button for me, which was the, uhm, the army vehicles. 

00:13:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:13:15
SARAH But I, I, once again, ah, I feel like, it's difficult. Ah, I guess I'm processing through it a lot faster than I thought it would be. 

00:13:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:25
SARAH Uhm, I have a sense of where, what the wave means to me, which I don't really have an, ah, uhm, this is a toughie. What I, 

00:13:50
[sil.] 

00:13:50
SARAH  I think that I would like to do the focusing on the book. Because the... (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
ALLEN E. IVEY On the book. (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
SARAH ...wave is pretty clear to me what it means. (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
SARAH And it just occurred to me that the, that the army vehicles are part of that authority and the shouldness aspect. They tie... (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
SARAH ...in somehow. So. 

00:14:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Very good. So, the army vehicles are authority and shouldness. (crosstalk) 

00:14:10
SARAH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:14:10
ALLEN E. IVEY You should get off. Ta ra, ta ra, ta ra, sort of... (crosstalk) 

00:14:10
SARAH And I... (crosstalk) 

00:14:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Pushing(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:14:10
SARAH ...should do it now in the proper order and. 

00:14:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Ah, again, Sarah, I do wanna comment, ah, both for you and the camera, is that, this is one of the great, I think, wonders of the psychodynamic approach. (crosstalk) 

00:14:25
SARAH Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:14:25
ALLEN E. IVEY A person is willing to go into it, is you're putting together, synthesizing those... (crosstalk) 

00:14:30
SARAH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:14:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...two elements right there. It's a good example of your own capability in... (crosstalk) 

00:14:30
SARAH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:14:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Free association. 

00:14:30
SARAH  Uh hmm. 

00:14:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, I think that sounds great. So, si, and that you got, ah, some sense of the wave and you let that go and you'd like to look at the, at the book. 

00:14:40
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:14:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Fine. So, the feelings with the book that you recall now, ah, are? 

00:14:45
SARAH  Uhm, it's, it's a kind of book that, it's one of the kind of books that I had keep at home. I have a number, or some, which is a book that I, I really value what's on the inside. 

00:15:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:00
SARAH But I may never read it. 

00:15:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:15:00
SARAH And yet, it's rather the feeling that having that book gives me. 

00:15:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:05
SARAH Or I, I like to say the, I get what's inside it through osmosis rather than through actually reading it. 

00:15:15
ALLEN E. IVEY I see. 

00:15:15
SARAH And so, for me, that's like, what that book is, is that it's there and on a unconscious level, I know what it i, what's in the book. 

00:15:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:25
SARAH But I may not ever read it. But it's... (crosstalk) 

00:15:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:15:25
SARAH Very precious and it's, uhm, It's like, ah, the core of me. 

00:15:30
ALLEN E. IVEY The core of you. (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
SARAH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
ALLEN E. IVEY So it's in the feelings around that core of you... (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
SARAH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
ALLEN E. IVEY That possession of yourself and the possessions where'd you move.(ph) You used also some feelings of annoyance. 

00:15:40
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:15:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, when the waves... (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
SARAH When I got... (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...came in. (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
SARAH ...wet, I was feeling very protective of the book and a little annoyed... (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
SARAH ...that everything was happening so fast and I wasn't able to protect my book quite as much... (crosstalk) 

00:15:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:15:50
SARAH ...as I, as I wanted to. 

00:15:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  So, the feelings that you weren't able to protect your book... (crosstalk) 

00:15:55
SARAH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:15:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...quite as much as you want. Would you like to go with that particular feeling? You weren't able to protect your book as much as you might want to? 

00:16:00
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:16:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. Could you just kinda go through those emotions and. 

00:16:05
SARAH Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, again, with your hands that you just had? 

00:16:05
SARAH Well, there's a feeling of wanting to hold it and hold it up... (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
SARAH ...and, and not so much to hide it from other people... (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
SARAH ...but just to, so that, that it isn't tainted or damaged... (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:20
SARAH ...by wa, wetness... (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
SARAH ...or dirt or whatever. (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
SARAH  Because it, it's, it's special and it's... (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
SARAH ...precious. 

00:16:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. And the feeling... (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
SARAH And it's... (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
ALLEN E. IVEY That, this... (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
SARAH ...and, there's this kind of, ah, I wanna hold it to me feeling... (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Hold it to me. (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
SARAH ...in it, uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, let's, hold your hands. "I wanna hold it to me." Just say that. 

00:16:35
SARAH I wanna hold it to me. 

00:16:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Hold it to me. 

00:16:40
SARAH I'll hold it to me. 

00:16:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Get with that feeling and then I'd like you to drift back at your own rate to an earlier experience in your life, any type of experience, when you got it, ah, open your eyes and I'd like to hear about it if you'd like to share it. 

00:17:00
[sil.] 

00:17:00
SARAH  Hmm. There's so many things that are going through me, through me, ah, and I would have to just work on focusing in any one of them. 

00:17:20
[sil.] 

00:17:20
SARAH  Well, the first thing that, that just comes to me is a, an experience that, ah, I had in a workshop where we were pulling towels... 

00:17:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:17:45
SARAH ...and my line was, uhm, the other person's line was, "Give it to me. I want it." And my line was, "It's mine. You can't have it. It's mine." And, ah. 

00:18:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

00:18:00
SARAH  Really wanting to just make sure that, I'm, that this remains part of me. 

00:18:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

00:18:10
SARAH  And I don't lose it. 

00:18:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Remains part of me. I don't lose it. Okay, could you go back to, perhaps, an early childhood recollection based on those feelings? 

00:18:25
[sil.] 

00:18:25
SARAH  Hmm. 

00:18:45
[sil.] 

00:18:45
SARAH  This part is very fuzzy for me, uhm, I would say my childhood is a very fuzzy part of my life. 

00:18:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:55
SARAH  Uhm. I don't have a specific image, but I have the thoughts around, uhm, first of all, playing with kids at school and them not letting me play with them and fighting with them till I get them to let me play kickball with them. And another image that comes, not physically fighting but arguing and taking the ball and holding it. Then, uhm, the other ah, thought that comes to mind is being the oldest of five children and we're in this very short space and I feel some co, competition or did feel some competition with my brothers and sisters for my parents' attention. 

00:19:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:50
SARAH  Which is something that's changing now but that's only recently. 

00:19:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:55
SARAH  Uhm. 

00:20:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. I think that would be good. Ah, first one, you talked about was this feeling of, a, a situation where you're, okay, arguing a little bit with, with kids, ah, could you elaborate a little more on that? 

00:20:15
SARAH Uhm, ha, I remember, ah, an afternoon during recess, I think I was in the third grade. 

00:20:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:25
SARAH Uhm, there was a group of girls that I really wanted to play with as a, as a girl... 

00:20:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:30
SARAH ...and, uhm, I always seem to be on the outside. I couldn't quite gain entry into their circle. 

00:20:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:35
SARAH  And, or at least that's what I thought. Maybe I did, but I, uhm, they would always play kickball... 

00:20:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:20:45
SARAH ...at recess and I wanted to play and there were times when they would tease me a lot... 

00:20:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:20:50
SARAH ...and not let me play or tell me that I couldn't. 

00:20:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:20:50
SARAH And I remember one day taking the ball from Karen and then, her taking it back from me and somebody took my, my hand and I remember biting them. 

00:21:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:05
SARAH That was one way I defended myself from those days. And really fighting for my right to be there and to, 

00:21:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:15
SARAH to have a part in this. Uhm. 

00:21:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:20
SARAH I, I've always felt like I was on the outside. 

00:21:25
ALLEN E. IVEY You always felt you're on the outside. (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
SARAH Ah, ah, ah, especially during that time. Third grade was a major year for me in terms of feeling on the outside of, of social groups, but that's a feeling that's carried through for me... (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
SARAH ...for a long time. Uhm. 

00:21:35
ALLEN E. IVEY When you say this feeling of being on the outside, what is, what goes on inside when you say being outside? Do you mean emotions now or? 

00:21:45
SARAH I feel a churning inside. Uhm, I don't usually define these feelings, so I, I. (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Churning. 

00:22:00
SARAH Uhm, there's a churning and a feeling of missing out and, uhm, what, really missing out on what other people are doing in connection with other people and... 

00:22:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:10
SARAH  uhm, there's also a feeling of, "Okay. If I'm going to be on the outside, then I'm going to have a lot of involvement and things going on behind that," so that... 

00:22:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:20
SARAH ...if that's the way it must be, then I will continue to have a lot going on behind the scenes. 

00:22:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:25
SARAH  And, ah, attract to me what's mine. 

00:22:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Attract to you what's yours. 

00:22:30
SARAH  Uh hmm. 

00:22:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Your, your possession... (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
SARAH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...I would think. (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
SARAH Yeah. 

00:22:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
SARAH Possession but also my, my rights to, or what's inherently mine and the experiencing, in, in social groups or in the world. 

00:22:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm, and you also said you felt, bit somebody. What were your feelings with that? 

00:22:55
SARAH (sighs) Angry. Ah, that, that's a phase I was going through at the time. (laughs) Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:23:05
SARAH I remember I bit a doctor who's trying to give me a shot at that, at that age too. 

00:23:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:10
SARAH So, (laughs) yeah, it was kind of a way I used to protect people... (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
SARAH ...from, from going too far with me. 

00:23:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:15
SARAH Going too deep... 

00:23:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Let's just take... (crosstalk) 

00:23:20
SARAH ...or hurting me. 

00:23:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Just take what you just said and, so on one hand, we have here what you've just said about the feelings of anger and being a little on the outside. 

00:23:30
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:23:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Wanting to protect what is yours. On the other hand, we have the dream you're talking about, the water coming in, some feelings of annoyance, so I was just wondering if anything occurs to you to bring those together at this point. 

00:23:40
SARAH  Well, even though the water feels good and, uhm, is exciting and stimulating, there's an element of it invading. 

00:23:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
SARAH What I perceive to be mine. 

00:23:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:55
SARAH Uhm. 

00:23:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  Invading what pers, perceiving to be yours? 

00:24:00
SARAH In-, infringing... (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
SARAH ...on my, on some kind of psychic space that I have symbolized in the book. 

00:24:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Would you like to go back and talk a little bit more now about, ah, you said that, ah, you were the eldest of five children. 

00:24:15
SARAH Uh hmm. I'm the eldest of five children, (laughs) yes. 

00:24:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
SARAH And my youngest sister is seven years younger than me and, uhm, I guess my, my first brother was born when I was about a year. 

00:24:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:30
SARAH Could be a year and half and, uhm, what that means for me right now is that I lost my parents' attention very young. 

00:24:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:40
SARAH And my brothers and sisters came fast and furious. By the time I was seven I had four competitors for attention. (crosstalk) 

00:24:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:45
SARAH When I say that, that's very interesting because I have viewed myself as a non-competitive person. 

00:24:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:24:55
SARAH From quite a few years, and I'm just starting to realize that I am competitive. 

00:24:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:25:00
SARAH Uhm, especially... (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
ALLEN E. IVEY I like that something. (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
SARAH ...for attention. Thanks. (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. I just want to say that I like that determination that you're saying, especially, that you are a competitor especially for attention, go ahead. 

00:25:10
SARAH Uh hmm. Uhm, and also interestingly enough, I really feel that my parents were not as aware of what was going on with me because, 

00:25:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
SARAH because I was going to have to deal with less attention, I became very strong and tough. 

00:25:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:25
SARAH And my parents saw me as being the one who was tough, who could take care of myself and... (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
SARAH uhm, they never realized that, or they didn't realize that I haven't had as many social problems as, as I did. (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:35
SARAH Uhm, and they were very confused when later on, I moved to the mountains and joined a spiritual group... 

00:25:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
SARAH ...and really cut myself off from them. 

00:25:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
SARAH Uhm, it's only been in the last of couple of years that, that's starting to come out and as I said I'm starting to realize that I'm competitive. 

00:25:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:55
SARAH Uhm. 

00:25:55
ALLEN E. IVEY You have your own... (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
SARAH That I think I've proven. (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
ALLEN E. IVEY form(ph) of what you wanna be. 

00:26:00
SARAH Yeah. 

00:26:00
ALLEN E. IVEY You have your own book. 

00:26:00
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:26:00
ALLEN E. IVEY How do you wanna write it... (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
SARAH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
ALLEN E. IVEY yourself. 

00:26:05
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:26:05
ALLEN E. IVEY And I'm hearing you with(ph) that? 

00:26:05
SARAH Yeah. Yeah. (laughs) 

00:26:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, we could go a lot harder with this, but just sort of, how do you put together those, the images of the, the book and the wave, ah, the tro, the, yourself with your siblings, yourself with the, at the, and, and, when you were three, does, any pattern or sense emerge for you there? How it might relate? 

00:26:30
SARAH All together. 

00:26:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:26:30
SARAH Uhm. 

00:26:35
[sil.] 

00:26:35
SARAH  Well, interestingly enough, ah, the way I see this is that there are, there are three distinct phases of my, 

00:26:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:45
SARAH my personal development, uhm, certainly, the brother-sister family development. (crosstalk) 

00:26:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:50
SARAH  And, uhm, then the social development with my peers in school... 

00:27:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:00
SARAH And then, uhm, even though I skipped to the spiritual part, I, there's some there, too. 

00:27:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:05
SARAH Then, uhm, right now, once again, I have this, I'm emerging from a, a, a lifestyle that I've been in and I'm trying to hold on to what I feel is my core and there's all this new stuff coming in and it is a, still a form of assault. 

00:27:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:27:25
SARAH And yet it's a, an exciting form of assault. It's not, and I'm trying to find the balance between that... (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:30
SARAH ...the, the feeling of assault and at the same time being very attracted to the water... (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:27:35
SARAH ...and wanting to hold on... (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:35
SARAH ...wanting to be there, wanting to stay on the beach. 

00:27:40
ALLEN E. IVEY So are you saying that in, in effect, the waves coming in are the assault that you are going through your doctoral program and new ideas and excitement there? 

00:27:45
SARAH New ideas and also having to, also really having to try to be more logical and more linear in my thinking which... (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
ALLEN E. IVEY The more shouldness. 

00:27:55
SARAH ...oh, right, because I am discovering just how much of a, a right brain, spatial thinker I am and holistic and, uhm, it's very difficult for me to go from point A to point B without thinking of F and H and Z... (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:10
SARAH ...and putting them bet-, in between A and B. 

00:28:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:28:15
SARAH So, uhm, there's, I'm enjoying, and I'm enjoying the discipline and the challenge of it and I'm attracted to it but it's also an assault to everything that I've done. 

00:28:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:28:25
SARAH In other ways, which is, I really do have a, have a way of picking pieces out of midair, and not... 

00:28:35
(crosstalk) 

00:28:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:28:35
SARAH ...worrying about whether they seem to fit right now, (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:28:35
SARAH but they will eventually. 

00:28:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  So that assault, in a sense, ah, would you, say, your second oldest sibling, I think the brother, was an assault in the sense. These people were assaulting you. 

00:28:50
SARAH And this was, in the dream it was my youngest brother... (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Your youngest brother. 

00:28:50
SARAH ...but that's, ah, my second oldest brother. 

00:28:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
SARAH Yeah. There was, ah, we, we had fair amount of competition. It's a very... (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:29:00
SARAH ...I, I don't know what to think... (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:29:00
SARAH ...about that relationship. We've been out of touch... (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:29:05
SARAH ...pretty much for 13 years. 

00:29:05
ALLEN E. IVEY And we've been going through this in a somewhat, on a somewhat, a quite irrational thing. What's going on with you emotionally now, ah, as we talked about this, this moment? 

00:29:15
SARAH (sighs) Well, uhm, there is some anxiety around talking about (laughs) my doctoral program at all because I have this, (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
SARAH  this kind of, I should (laughs) go over here, going, 

00:29:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:30
SARAH I should do this. 

00:29:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:30
SARAH  Of course, there's a part that says I want to do it too. 

00:29:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:35
SARAH But, uhm, I have some issues with doing it the way somebody is, or some authority is telling me, "I must do it"... (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:45
SARAH ...versus the way I need to do it or I want to do it or what's true to myself. I, I'm not resolved on that, like I kind of have a funny feeling (laughs) over here from that. 

00:30:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:00
SARAH Uhm, then there is also a, a feeling of, gee, somehow all this is fitting together right now and I'm really fascinated by, 

00:30:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:10
SARAH  uhm, that correlation between my different passages through growth periods... (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:20
SARAH ...and, and what that means right now. 

00:30:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:20
SARAH Uhm, and feeling like the dream is, is telling me that, yes, there's some similarities to the old things, but ra, but there's also some, uhm, there's some change because I'm really... (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:30
SARAH  Drawn to the water. 

00:30:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:35
SARAH Uhm. 

00:30:35
ALLEN E. IVEY The excitement, yeah. 

00:30:35
SARAH Excited and... (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Gone to decide(ph) a way... (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
SARAH  really not, uhm, not saying I'm not gonna be a part of this... (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:40
SARAH ...which in, with the kids and with my brothers and sisters I did that. I, 

00:30:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:45
SARAH removed myself. 

00:30:45
ALLEN E. IVEY So, Sarah is choosing; you are choosing... (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
SARAH Uh hmm, to be a part. 

00:30:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...to be a part. 

00:30:50
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:30:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. Do you want an, do as you, ah, how are you, what stood out for you so far in our reaction to anything that I've done there's going on between us? 

00:31:00
SARAH (sighs) Well, first of all, I've noticed that you have mirrored some of the things (laughs) I've done. 

00:31:05
ALLEN E. IVEY I have some. (laughs) Some. 

00:31:10
SARAH And the other thing that I've noticed is that, uhm, you've caught on, you've taken something I have said and, and repeated, reflected it back to me like, ah, in a restatement or in... (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:31:20
SARAH  I don't wanna say reflection of feeling, but there is definitely, you get a piece of my image and you may use a different word but somehow that integrates right back into it and expands it for me and... (crosstalk) 

00:31:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
SARAH ...I'm really aware that you're doing that. 

00:31:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
SARAH  Also, I've noticed you've done some paraphrasing, but I'm trying to really state with my own experience. 

00:31:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:31:40
SARAH  And, 

00:31:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Is there any specific thing I've done, which is, I guess, first of all, have been helpful or second, then, taking the wrong track? 

00:31:50
SARAH I think the repeating of, of, uhm, certain words I've said has been very useful. 

00:32:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
SARAH Uhm, also trying to, I'm very resistant to free association. That's very... (crosstalk) 

00:32:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:10
SARAH ...threatening to me. 

00:32:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:10
SARAH And, but, uhm, you gave me enough time to really do that and... 

00:32:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
SARAH  trying to tie those in together. 

00:32:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:20
SARAH Uhm, so keeping go, keep going back to those things, (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:32:25
SARAH and then bring it to the present seems to be very meaningful, but just your mirroring of my non-verbals, and this one was a especially noticeable to me. There were a couple of other... (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:32:35
SARAH ...I mean, I did this and at one point... 

00:32:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:32:40
SARAH ...and you did the same thing. Uhm, if there's a non-verbal message there that somehow I'm picking up, 

00:32:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:32:50
SARAH it's almost like a, a sign language. 

00:32:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
SARAH And I, I don't know what the meaning was, but on, and, and something, it just brought out something. It brought out a meaning which I may not... 

00:33:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:00
SARAH ...be able to put into words yet. 

00:33:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Is it a positive or a negative meaning? 

00:33:05
SARAH Oh, gee, I would say positive, uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:33:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:10
SARAH ...if I consciously thought about it, I could think about some threatening things... (crosstalk) 

00:33:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:33:15
SARAH ...that this movement might mean. 

00:33:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:15
SARAH But in terms of, uhm, just getting the mirroring back... 

00:33:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:20
SARAH ...and, and having that sink in... 

00:33:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:20
SARAH  Somewhere, I, I look at that kind of information as good, not bad. 

00:33:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Anything, place... (crosstalk) 

00:33:30
SARAH Positive or negative. 

00:33:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...just, that you had identified that, which seemed off or distracting? 

00:33:30
SARAH Off or distracting? The angry part about the book getting damaged, for some reason, that pushed a button, that felt like little rocks are rubbing against each other right there. 

00:33:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Rocks are rubbing against each other. 

00:33:50
SARAH Inside. And it just, it, is that it almost, that, oh, a kind of jar to my... 

00:33:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Yeah, and it... 

00:33:55
SARAH ...to my thoughts. 

00:33:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and, and it, it may very well be. I think we're about to end for this particular phase, 

00:34:00
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:34:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ah, that that might be an important thing to explore. 

00:34:05
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:34:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh, the purpose here is really to show that we can take a dream, 

00:34:10
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:34:10
ALLEN E. IVEY focus on a feeling and then go back to early life experience... 

00:34:15
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:34:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ...we found that some of those early life experience that you started using some of the exact same words describe early life experience that you're using here and now. 

00:34:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:34:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And it wasn't conscious on my part originally. I found that, actually, picking up the words which you seem to highlight... 

00:34:30
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:34:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  and I'm like the normal encourager(ph) seems to be particularly important. 

00:34:35
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:34:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And the feedback is I think the research literature(ph) I mean to say is matching those key words... (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:34:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...as particularly important. Uh, I think it's obvious that the analysis of the dream is incomplete, particularly when you get them these rocks rattling around. In getting the whole issue... (crosstalk) 

00:34:50
SARAH (laughs) Yes. 

00:34:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...of dealing with anger and, 

00:34:50
SARAH Uh-huh. 

00:34:50
ALLEN E. IVEY and I can't help but just wonder, should stop(ph)... 

00:34:55
SARAH Uh-huh. 

00:34:55
ALLEN E. IVEY (inaudible ) at some point and, ah, some of the... (crosstalk) 

00:34:57
SARAH Ah, and I, and I have so-, I already have an association to the ro, rocks grinding. 

00:35:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:35:05
SARAH And, ah... 

00:35:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, could you share that before we sign off? Would you rather not. (crosstalk) 

00:35:05
SARAH Sure. Uhm, I used to grind my teeth in my sleep. 

00:35:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah. 

00:35:10
SARAH And I was in a sensory awareness workshop with Charlotte Silver in Mexico. 

00:35:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:35:15
SARAH Uhm, about four years ago and we did a number of exercises around paying attention to the face and when we we're... 

00:35:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:35:25
SARAH ...what we're doing with our muscles and everything. And I went through three days of intense pain in my gums and I've never ground my teeth in my sleep ever since. 

00:35:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. So, there are lots of data. 

00:35:35
SARAH Yeah. Yeah. 

00:35:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, again there's a wonderful example, I think, of the value of free association... (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:35:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...right there, you demonstrated it again. 

00:35:40
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:35:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And that's your association, not mine. 

00:35:40
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:35:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  All I did was say. 

00:35:45
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:35:45
ALLEN E. IVEY What, what crosses your mind, this wonderful chance, whimsical associations... 

00:35:50
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:35:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...can be brought together, I believe, into a synthesis. 

00:35:50
SARAH Yeah. 

00:35:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, let's sign off at this point and go on to the next segment. 

00:35:55
Interview Two: Dereflection Technique 

00:35:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  As you can sense, when you're doing psychodynamic dream analysis, you can go on and on and on with the analysis. There are an infinite array of possibilities. There is a very large sense of incompleteness. Ah, and I guess we looked at that dream in the nes, necessity to focus on one thing, perhaps, at a time, or to get overwhelmed by the data. Ah, in this session, I'd like to continue with Sarah and use a technique which I found very helpful and very positive, ah, developed by Elizabeth Lukas, ah, and I think derived from Viktor Frankl's work. Elizabeth Lukas is a professor at the University of Munich. The technique is called dereflection. Ah, people tend to think about the negative meaning of events in their life, and as you know, Viktor Frankl survived the horrors of a concentration camp because he was able to find positive meaning. The technique of dereflection is basically concerned with noting negative events from the past of sometimes from the present and associating them with, with a po, positive meaning, what positive strengths can you find in the individual, and then you attempt to synthesize these two in a new reality, a new meaning. Ah, the dereflection technique, you will notice, is very similar to that which Jean Jennlyn(ph) talks about in focusing and that which the new and I know few people talk about in their concept of reframing. Ah, I think that, uh, Viktor Frankl and Elizabeth Lukas's work are particularly important in logotheraphy because they not only, or have a technique, but they also have a philosophy behind it. 

00:37:35
Interview Two: Dereflection Technique 

00:37:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  Sarah, were going to begin again now and we've just talked in the short break about, ah, the, Viktor Frankl's, ah, technique of dereflection which I'd like to demonstrate and we agreed that we will take one of those childhood instances and use that. Is that okay? 

00:38:00
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:38:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Good. Okay. Ah, what we're gonna be doing here is ask you to come back to the, become third grade Sarah. 

00:38:10
SARAH Hmm, okay. (laughs) 

00:38:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And get in touch with some of those feelings and, ah, so, could you go back and just tell me again about that incident when you were in the third grade and you felt a little on the out and. 

00:38:25
SARAH  Uhm, okay, uhm, third grade, a little on the out. The third grade, uhm, we moved, was the, the third and fourth grade that I had most of my problems, uhm, we just moved back from California. I'm trying to pull in on it. Uhm, we lived in California for my kindergarten... (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:38:55
SARAH ...and the first grade. Uhm, we're in Massachusetts again, been back, I was working on my second year and my third year of being back in Massachusetts. Uhm, third grade was in a especially difficult year... (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:39:20
SARAH ...for me. Uhm, the woman who was my teacher, although I like her very much... 

00:39:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:39:25
SARAH ...uhm, teased a lot and the kids did a lot of teasing in that age. 

00:39:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:39:30
SARAH  Uhm, I don't remember being unpopular in the second grade, but I do remember developing an unpopular type status... 

00:39:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
SARAH ...amongst kids in the third grade. 

00:39:50
ALLEN E. IVEY So you felt unpopular. 

00:39:50
SARAH  Unpopular and I got a lot of teasing. There was a lot of teasing going on... (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:39:55
SARAH ...on those days, ah, around boys and girls. They're just starting to notice each other. Uhm, I didn't notice boys too much at that age but... 

00:40:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:05
SARAH ...uhm, it was very important to me to be, to play. There are two girls who I was particularly interested in. 

00:40:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:20
SARAH And there was a whole group of girls around them. 

00:40:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:40:20
SARAH And, uhm, it was very difficult. I took all the teasing very seriously. 

00:40:30
ALLEN E. IVEY You took the teasing seriously. 

00:40:30
SARAH And, uhm, hmm, I'm better taking teasing now but it, and I can see how, if I take in the teasing a little lighter, I might (laughs) have done better... 

00:40:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:45
SARAH  but I didn't. I was very serious about it. 

00:40:50
ALLEN E. IVEY So, you feel you didn't handle it that well at that point. 

00:40:50
SARAH I don't think I handled it. 

00:40:50
ALLEN E. IVEY So could you take one specific incident that had occurred to you? 

00:40:55
SARAH Uhm, there was an incident in my third grade classroom where I was asked to erase something off of a board, 

00:41:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:10
SARAH and, uhm, there was a guy in there who was basically the class clown, 

00:41:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:20
SARAH and he went up and he started writing on the board, and every time I'd erase, he writes some more, and, ah, everybody in the class was laughing their head off. 

00:41:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:25
SARAH  And she was sitting over at her desk and I went over and said, "He won't let me do what I have to do." And she just started to laugh. Of course, that's why it was happening, 

00:41:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:35
SARAH but that infuriated me and I left the room. 

00:41:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Infuriated you and you left the room. (crosstalk) 

00:41:40
SARAH Uh hmm, Uh hmm, and, ah, the teacher had to follow me into the girls room and dragged me out, but, I mean I was very hurt by that and, uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:41:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:55
SARAH ...I don't, I don't associate the hurt with it as much as, uhm, somehow I'm not gonna be able to get what I need to do done and... (crosstalk) 

00:42:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:42:05
SARAH ...I'm gonna be blocked along the way and I'm not, ah, if I'm observed by other people, it's just gonna make it worse. 

00:42:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:42:10
SARAH So, uhm, that went on in, in, with the girls in my classroom in, in... (crosstalk) 

00:42:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:42:20
SARAH ...that particular grade. 

00:42:25
ALLEN E. IVEY So those feelings are hurt? 

00:42:25
SARAH  Feeling outside, 

00:42:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Feeling outside... (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
SARAH Feeling very outside. 

00:42:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, a little anger, am I right? Or... 

00:42:35
SARAH Some anger? 

00:42:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...I sense an anger in your face when you're talking about... (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
SARAH Oh, yeah. 

00:42:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...this guy erasing, the teasing... (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
SARAH Oh, yeah. That bugged me. It bugged me more that the teacher sat there and let him do it. 

00:42:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. So it left you feeling very... 

00:42:50
SARAH Uhm. 

00:42:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Teacher sitting or allowing his being the class clown and the class is laughing their head off. 

00:42:55
SARAH  My, ah, authority issues that's exactly my concept. (laughs). Uhm, I just feel that there was something about that certain situation that wasn't really fair to me. 

00:43:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Not fair. Uh hmm. 

00:43:15
SARAH  And, uhm, not that everything should be fair but rather that in, I just don't think it's right to let a classroom laugh at somebody that long and obviously hurt a person... (crosstalk) 

00:43:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:43:35
SARAH ...drive him out of the room, whatever, and not deal with, I mean that kind of stuff can be avoided, I think. 

00:43:40
ALLEN E. IVEY It's not right. It could have been avoided. (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
SARAH Yeah, not right. That would, really brings up my, not, were, it's not right. (laughs) 

00:43:45
ALLEN E. IVEY It's not right. 

00:43:45
SARAH Right. 

00:43:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Can you say it again? 

00:43:50
SARAH It's not right. 

00:43:50
ALLEN E. IVEY It's not right? Say it again. 

00:43:50
SARAH It's not right. 

00:43:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Again. 

00:43:55
SARAH It's not right, but (laughs). 

00:43:55
ALLEN E. IVEY You're laughing. 

00:43:55
SARAH I feel nervous and strange about saying it because, uhm, I don't, ah, I don't, I am uncomfortable with laying down a line, saying, "This is right, and this is wrong." 

00:44:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. And how does that leave you feeling about yourself going through that thing? 

00:44:25
SARAH Uhm, going through that experience... (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:25
SARAH or just going through that. (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:44:25
SARAH  Uhm, well, it's interesting 'coz I have a lot of problem talking in classes. 

00:44:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Still a lot of them. (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
SARAH To participate, to participating in large groups. (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
ALLEN E. IVEY How do you feel about yourself though as you don't talk in class or something. How do that, has leave you feeling about. (crosstalk) 

00:44:40
SARAH It makes me feel bad about myself. 

00:44:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Feel bad about yourself. 

00:44:45
SARAH Because I have not really shared and I haven't gotten the fullest experience out of it, possible. 

00:44:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. You feel bad about yourself. (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
SARAH And yet I'm still very, I have a very difficult time with that. (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm, yeah. See I can, ah, in my own way, let me take the track off but identify with that, ah... (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:45:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...I don't know exactly if it was at third grade, maybe about the same time, but the kids teased me, mercinally, mercilessly. 

00:45:10
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:45:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And at that time, I was a fat little kid. 

00:45:10
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:45:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, they called me Bartender. For some reason, that was just awful. I cried and cried. 

00:45:20
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:45:20
ALLEN E. IVEY I just felt totally alone, ah, and I felt it wasn't fair; it wasn't right. I had a lot of those same things you're talking about. (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:45:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Does that ring to you at all? 

00:45:30
SARAH Yeah. 

00:45:30
ALLEN E. IVEY It's a very negative and, and it don't, it also left me, I think, some of those same feelings at times. It's a little hard for me to speak up and... (crosstalk) 

00:45:35
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:45:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...not always gonna see good about myself. Maybe it's not fair, but why couldn't I manage it? 

00:45:40
SARAH Yeah. 

00:45:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Is that? 

00:45:40
SARAH  Yeah. 

00:45:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:45:45
SARAH I don't know if a kid can be expected to manage that stuff though. I mean they... 

00:45:50
ALLEN E. IVEY It's the, the thing is we still have this feeling. 

00:45:50
SARAH Yeah, I know. 

00:45:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, I'd like to look at that though from another perspective, and that is, what are some of the positive things about Sarah in grade three that she experiences then? What are some strengths? With this? 

00:46:10
SARAH Oh, I didn't have to take it. I had the strength to not take it and leave. 

00:46:15
ALLEN E. IVEY You had the strength to leave. 

00:46:20
SARAH To remove myself from something that's painful. (crosstalk) 

00:46:20
ALLEN E. IVEY If it's difficult enough, Sarah has the strength to leave. 

00:46:20
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:46:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  Okay. What are some other strengths? 

00:46:30
[sil.] 

00:46:30
SARAH Well I was very patient with Peter, the, the clown. 

00:46:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Patience. When he's going on and on? 

00:46:40
SARAH I did ask him to stop. I remember that. 

00:46:40
ALLEN E. IVEY You're able to ask him to stop? 

00:46:45
SARAH Right, but I, and I did get angry with him, but I didn't carry the anger with him as much as with the authority, ah... (crosstalk) 

00:47:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. That person really let you down more. 

00:47:00
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:47:00
ALLEN E. IVEY So you're able to have valid anger. 

00:47:05
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:47:05
ALLEN E. IVEY To be able to go on, patience, leave the situation, valid anger. 

00:47:10
SARAH Uh hmm. Hmm, uh hmm. 

00:47:15
ALLEN E. IVEY What are you feeling right now? 

00:47:15
SARAH It's difficult to, to focus in on the, the positive things of that particular experience. That happens to be one of the more, that's, that's one of the things I remember the most about the third grade as far as, uhm, my, in my bag of negative things (laughs). 

00:47:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:47:35
SARAH Uhm. 

00:47:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  But you smiled just before you said that. 

00:47:40
SARAH  Because it is, to me, I look at it as negative, but I hold on to it so that as long as, if it is as strong in a negative way, it's gotta be positive too. I feel uncomfortable with having something be, just on one side, be negative and not... (crosstalk) 

00:47:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Okay, what's, (crosstalk) 

00:48:00
SARAH (inaudible ) 

00:48:01
ALLEN E. IVEY what's more of that positive then? I've heard patience, ability to leave when necessary, ah... 

00:48:05
SARAH  Ah, it's, it's, (crosstalk) 

00:48:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Going on... (crosstalk) 

00:48:10
SARAH ...it's tough, it's tough, it's uhm. 

00:48:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Dealing with a tough situation. 

00:48:25
[sil.] 

00:48:25
SARAH Well, I know one thing, I didn't lash out at him. I didn't hit him, that's positive. (laughs) I didn't bite him. (laughs) 

00:48:30
ALLEN E. IVEY You didn't bite him. So you're learning. Okay. 

00:48:35
SARAH Uhm. 

00:48:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:48:35
SARAH But I tried something... (crosstalk) 

00:48:35
ALLEN E. IVEY But like to. 

00:48:35
SARAH I tried to another, oh, ah, avenue, but it didn't, that didn't work. 

00:48:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:40
SARAH Uhm, so that's the, I can try, I'm willing to try other alternatives once something didn't work. 

00:48:50
ALLEN E. IVEY When something doesn't work, you're able to generate other alternatives. 

00:48:50
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:48:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Sounds like quite a lot for a... (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:48:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...third grader in front of a room with the teacher not providing support, 

00:48:55
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:48:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  ah, the class clown, everybody laughs at anyone. 

00:49:00
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:49:00
ALLEN E. IVEY The kids all laughing, 

00:49:00
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:49:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  yet, you were able to carry on, 

00:49:05
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:49:05
ALLEN E. IVEY to find your own position, 

00:49:10
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:49:10
ALLEN E. IVEY and patience. 

00:49:10
SARAH  Hmm. I, it's interesting that I look at leaving the situation, right now I look at instead of turning around and facing that more, 

00:49:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:25
SARAH I look at, I think of that as not being a positive but given the fact that I really had no tools of which, with which to deal... (crosstalk) 

00:49:35
ALLEN E. IVEY A third grader but I'm not with them(ph). 

00:49:35
SARAH ...with that situation, that probably was the best thing I could have done. 

00:49:40
ALLEN E. IVEY So just imagine, there you are, then, some of the negatives you've been seeing in there... (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:49:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...with that, with that hand. Could you do that? Just imagine the negative feelings. Okay. How, how does that hand feel? 

00:49:55
[sil.] 

00:49:55
SARAH  Sort of lifeless. 

00:50:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. Now let's take the other hand and, third grader you had the sense to leave the room in a difficult situation. Ah, is able to, in fact, be more mature than the teacher at some sense, patient with the, with the kid, going along with it to a point. Ah, some of the other points, how's that, how's the right hand? What does your hand feel? 

00:50:25
SARAH  It feels lighter, more flexible. 

00:50:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Lighter, flexible. 

00:50:35
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:50:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Now just put the two hands together. 

00:50:40
SARAH It's interesting contrast between the hands. Uhm. 

00:50:50
[sil.] 

00:50:50
SARAH  Uh. 

00:50:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:55
SARAH  It's like I'm holding a tennis ball or egg. (laughs) 

00:51:00
ALLEN E. IVEY (laughs) Holding a tennis ball. Uh hmm. 

00:51:05
[sil.] 

00:51:05
SARAH Uhm, it's interesting too, uhm, still a lot of stiffness in my right arm. 

00:51:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:51:15
SARAH  And it's almost, although I'm holding a little bit on my wrist of my left, there, it's kind of like my left is blending or, or molding to the form of my right. 

00:51:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  So the right is dominating? 

00:51:35
SARAH Not in terms of the feeling of negative and positive, but in terms of, it's like a, given the pain and, and the, the discomfort and all those negative feelings. The feelings of strength have a feeling of working with those, 

00:51:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:51:50
SARAH  and working in spite of them. 

00:51:55
ALLEN E. IVEY In spite of difficulties... (crosstalk) 

00:51:55
SARAH Yeah. 

00:51:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...the strength to work with them. 

00:51:55
SARAH Uh-huh. Not that they would completely outweigh the other, 

00:52:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:52:00
SARAH but rather, that somehow, they would find a way of working together. 

00:52:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Someway they would, ah, find a way... (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:52:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...of working together. I believe so. 

00:52:10
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:52:10
ALLEN E. IVEY You can manage where to close (inaudible ) 

00:52:12
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:52:12
ALLEN E. IVEY Does this hand feel quite as heavy as it did? 

00:52:15
SARAH Uhm, no but it still, it does feel stiff, all through here and, I'm still holding it really stiffly. 

00:52:20
ALLEN E. IVEY We're not designing this to be a complete resolution.(crosstalk) 

00:52:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:52:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, this is, in a sense, the dereflection exercise... (crosstalk) 

00:52:30
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:52:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...which can be made more intensive. Hence, we could, could build in tears and laughter and all of these things... (crosstalk) 

00:52:35
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:52:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...for demonstration, I would really rather not do that. 

00:52:35
SARAH It's okay. (laughs) 

00:52:40
ALLEN E. IVEY (laughs) It's okay, huh, ah, and yet there is that beginning feeling of synthesis. 

00:52:45
SARAH Uh-huh. 

00:52:45
ALLEN E. IVEY This is what Viktor Frankl was talking about that says a new meaning to an old situation. 

00:52:50
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:52:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, what I tend to find is that, that's a beginning and I have old childhood incidents which I've used parallel techniques on myself and I realized that developmentally, a child, I really managed pretty well for the, given the setting, (crosstalk) 

00:53:10
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:53:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...the situation, 

00:53:10
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:53:10
ALLEN E. IVEY and as an American, it's highly individualistic culture, you put it all on, I put it all on my own shoulders. 

00:53:15
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:53:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And then as I start thinking about it in the sense that you have, I feel more comfortable with myself. 

00:53:20
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:53:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And I kind of expect that you'll feel a little more comfortable with that incident as you think about it. I was wondering how you react to that. 

00:53:25
SARAH Hmm. It's interesting because this is something, this particular incident has been coming up a lot in the last, ah, year or two. 

00:53:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:53:40
SARAH As far as the painful one goes. 

00:53:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:53:45
SARAH In dealing with groups goes. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:53:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:53:45
SARAH  I do look at it in terms of I, I, do have that sense of, well, given that situation, I still did these things, which, that was positive, 

00:54:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:54:00
SARAH  that was strength, 

00:54:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:54:05
SARAH and ah, I feel a little, you know, it's preliminary, I feel a little more faith in my own strength. 

00:54:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:54:10
SARAH  Uhm, to follow what's benevish, beneficial for me... 

00:54:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:54:20
SARAH ...and, uhm, given, given the set of tools that I have at that time. 

00:54:25
ALLEN E. IVEY I think at this point, we'll, ah, zero in just briefly on faith in your own strength, 

00:54:35
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:54:35
ALLEN E. IVEY and ah, call this just the beginning in looking at a situation in the past more positive. 

00:54:40
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:54:40
ALLEN E. IVEY As you know, we could take a situation in the present and look at it more positively using the same techniques. 

00:54:45
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:54:45
ALLEN E. IVEY The hand technique, ah, is really not necessarily part of dereflections, almost could have drawn from Gestalt, bring the two together. 

00:54:50
SARAH  Uh hmm. 

00:54:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And sometimes you expect that, oh, you're gonna solve all your problems right away. No, I didn't wanna set you up for that. 

00:55:00
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:55:00
ALLEN E. IVEY You see. Just ease the burden a little and that you work on it in your own way. 

00:55:00
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:55:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  And find your own direction. I found this technique from logotherapy very, very helpful. 

00:55:10
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:55:10
ALLEN E. IVEY This counseling is so concerned, Sarah, I think, with negatives. Oh, I had this problem, a child, I had this dream, and then that, that's why we go on for analysis, and yet, you wouldn't be here today if you didn't have a lot of strengths. 

00:55:20
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:55:20
ALLEN E. IVEY You got through those things. Somehow, our culture has taught us to focus on the negative. 

00:55:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:55:25
ALLEN E. IVEY In particular, I think, it's time to start focusing more on the positive and that's why Viktor Frankl's philosophy is so important to me personally and you take what you want of it but, ah, it's a technique but it's also a philosophy. 

00:55:40
SARAH I happen to like Viktor Frankl a lot. I think it's a very important theory. 

00:55:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. Thank you very much. 

00:55:45
COPYRIGHT 1983, ALLEN E. IVEY Interview Three: Assertiveness Training 

00:55:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Insight and awareness are not action. A person can have all kinds of psychodynamics, psychoanalytic understandings but is something going to happen? Behavioral psychologists will often challenge the psychodynamic approach and I think the research literature also indicates that, ah, insight does not necessarily sort itself in behavioral change. Ah, I would argue personally, although I think each of you have to make your own decision, for including at least some behavioral techniques in your armament. Ah, recent data, the Smith and Glassman(ph) analysis, ah, et cetera, seem to indicate that a particularly good way to transfer insight into action are behavioral techniques where they start with cognitive behavioral modification, ah, or whatever. In this particular tape, I would like to demonstrate an elementary, simple assertion training, ah, technique. Sarah decided to take some of the beginning insights we've had in these two previous tapes into her everyday life. As you're bringing up a situation and I will be applying some techniques, assertion training, will again have to be arbitrarily condensed. Some of the aspects will be covered over briefly but I'd like to show at least an indication of what can be done. 

00:57:35
Interview Three: Assertiveness Training 

00:57:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  Now, Sarah, I'd like to continue, and, ah, we've talked about, ah, some issues, ah, in the first session on, ah, the dream analysis, ah, which seem to have some parallels at least in the incident we worked on in terms of the logotherapy technique of dereflection. Ah, perhaps you might seek and find some ideas from that to, ah, and particularly building on those strengths, ah, to use it maybe even next week in, ah, a practical way... (crosstalk) 

00:58:15
SARAH  Uh hmm. 

00:58:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...I'd like to go through a, a simple assertion training model, ah, is that okay? 

00:58:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:58:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Good. So, how might this type of thing, you know, ah, maybe a little more patience than you need. You had this patience and the strength, but sometimes it's, ends up with you not feeling so good about yourself and not taking this strong position as you might. How has that work out, ah, this incident going now that you mentioned you might be willing to talk about? 

00:58:45
SARAH  Well it, it's something that happens fairly regularly... (crosstalk) 

00:58:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:55
SARAH ...with people who are making demands on me. Uhm, and demands beyond what, what I'm really feeling I'm able to give, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:59:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm, demands, assaults, should. 

00:59:05
SARAH Yeah, right. (laughing) That's so funny. Uhm, it all fits, uhm, this, uhm, this student I know is, uhm, she and I were in a, a workshop together... (crosstalk) 

00:59:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:59:20
SARAH ...this summer and she has been, we learned a lot and we worked, worked very closely together... (crosstalk) 

00:59:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:59:35
SARAH ...in this workshop but she, ah, really wants to hold on to me... (crosstalk) 

00:59:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:59:40
SARAH ...and she really wants to know me and be a part of my life. That's something to just, that's just a comment... (crosstalk) 

00:59:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:59:45
SARAH ...or a phrase she uses out, how am I gonna be part of your life for one(ph), and, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:59:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  How, how is she gonna be a part of your life? 

00:59:55
SARAH  It's, in my opinion, there are some sexual overtones to it. 

01:00:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:00
SARAH  And there are certainly some overtones in terms of a woman that was important to her in the past... (crosstalk) 

01:00:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:10
SARAH ...when she was a little girl. And I don't really feel equipped or willing to deal with what she wants to deal with. 

01:00:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:20
SARAH And uhm, she wants to, to, they were at school together, she wants to, to see me and do things with me. 

01:00:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:30
SARAH And I really don't want to. 

01:00:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:30
SARAH  But I am having a very difficult time saying no to her. 

01:00:40
ALLEN E. IVEY So you're being patient like... (crosstalk) 

01:00:40
SARAH Yeah... (crosstalk) 

01:00:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...with the clown? 

01:00:40
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:00:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:40
SARAH And ah, I don't like the fact that I am not saying no to her. 

01:00:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:50
SARAH But I also, am having a very difficult time balancing out the idea that if I say no to her and I tell her that I don't wanna see her anymore... (crosstalk) 

01:01:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:00
SARAH ...or whatever, that I'm gonna hurt her. 

01:01:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:01:05
SARAH And then I will feel guilty for doing that and so it just, it's a mess. 

01:01:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  And so that, it's a mess ah, you'd like to break it off that you're being patient and. (crosstalk) 

01:01:15
SARAH Uh hmm, I'm hoping that it will break itself off... (crosstalk) 

01:01:15
ALLEN E. IVEY You hope it will break itself off. (crosstalk) 

01:01:15
SARAH ...because I can't deal with it. 

01:01:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  'Coz you can't deal with it? Uh hmm. Okay ah, the, there are couple of ways that we could go in this ah, we could do like ah, do the psychoanalytic thing and analyze it... (crosstalk) 

01:01:30
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:01:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...I think sometimes to death(ph)... (crosstalk) 

01:01:30
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:01:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and it sounds like though you've got a goal. 

01:01:30
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:01:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Where you might like to go. Is it, you would like to break off the relationship, is that right? 

01:01:35
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:01:35
ALLEN E. IVEY How it feel to break off the relationship? 

01:01:40
SARAH Well, with the way things are right now, it would be a relief. 

01:01:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:45
SARAH Uhm, the other possibility is that we could work through some of the things... (crosstalk) 

01:01:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:55
SARAH ...but I, what I have tried to work through with her already, I have, it's come out even more murky and, and confusing and scary and uhm, I, I spent a whole week just being so tight right here in my chest... (crosstalk) 

01:02:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:02:10
SARAH ...I couldn't eat. I couldn't... (crosstalk) 

01:02:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh really? 

01:02:10
SARAH  I could hardly work and it was just, it was really unpleasant and I don't, I don't really wanna do that to myself. 

01:02:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And when you felt tight in your chest, how did you feel towards yourself and murky and so forth? 

01:02:25
SARAH I felt threatened. 

01:02:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Threatened? 

01:02:25
SARAH It was like... (crosstalk) 

01:02:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:02:25
SARAH ...it was kinda like I had this fantasy that it might be like a big, the tighting, tightening of your heart just before a heart attack or something. 

01:02:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:02:35
SARAH I really felt attacked. 

01:02:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:02:40
SARAH Ah, and on my feeling level I felt like I was being punched right here in my heart area. 

01:02:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And in the past how do you typically responded to attack like that? 

01:02:50
SARAH Past, how have I typically responded to. (crosstalk) 

01:02:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:02:50
SARAH I've tried to work it out. 

01:02:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Tried to work it out? 

01:02:50
SARAH I've been pretty honest about what I'm feeling and given... (crosstalk) 

01:03:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:03:05
SARAH ...the person feedback and, and stated my ground rules and try to let the person adjust to that. 

01:03:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm, so you really sound like ah, you pardon me ah, the interpretation. Sound like kind of ah, a 32 year-old Sarah from the third grade. Some of the same skills... (crosstalk) 

01:03:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:03:25
ALLEN E. IVEY You're developing in the third grade... (crosstalk) 

01:03:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:03:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...you're using now. 

01:03:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:03:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And yet there comes a point, you think maybe its time to cut off. And while, I mean, it's really... (crosstalk) 

01:03:30
SARAH I see. Yes... (crosstalk) 

01:03:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  What is your goal... (crosstalk) 

01:03:35
SARAH ...yes. But. (crosstalk) 

01:03:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...would you like to cut off or you'd like to work through? 

01:03:35
SARAH I'd rather cut off. 

01:03:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

01:03:35
SARAH Uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:03:35
ALLEN E. IVEY The. (crosstalk) 

01:03:35
SARAH ...that's uncomfortable to say but that's what I'd rather do. 

01:03:45
ALLEN E. IVEY I, and that's a something that isn't very easy for you to do, you'd said? 

01:03:45
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:03:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. Ah, what I'd like to do is do, first of all, a role-play with like it is. And, I don't know how well I can portray this person but I'll do the best I can. 

01:03:55
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:03:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And ah, is she a touchy type of person, touchy? So I'm really, really glad to see you ah, there's a good ah, flick on over at the Pleasant Street ah, I thought I'd go over there tomorrow, would like to go? 

01:04:10
SARAH  I'm trying to uhm, I don't know if I want to go. 

01:04:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:04:20
SARAH Uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:04:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And ah, I found that Von Ducci's(ph) has gelati now. And I really like the gelati and ah, I think that'd be nice, we could go there for a little, little, you know, discussion before we get there and talk about the group somewhere. How would that be? 

01:04:30
SARAH Uhm, when were you thinking of doing it? 

01:04:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Tomorrow night. I'll come by and pick you up. How about it? I really like to be with you Sarah. 

01:04:40
SARAH  Uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:04:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, okay ah, I'll be by... (crosstalk) 

01:04:45
SARAH all right. I... (crosstalk) 

01:04:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  about six o' clock okay? 

01:04:50
SARAH (laughs) Uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:04:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

01:04:50
SARAH I'm not sure I want to. 

01:04:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uhm, well but we can work through there 'coz I know we've had some of these things going on between us in the past but I think we can work it through. Let's not do it now but let's just do it then, okay? I'll pick you up. 

01:05:05
SARAH Uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:05:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay ah, is that the general... (crosstalk) 

01:05:05
SARAH  Yeah. 

01:05:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...it's, how close is that? 

01:05:10
SARAH That's really close 'coz I've really feel the holding back, that tightness is right there again. 

01:05:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And there's, we recreated some of the... (crosstalk) 

01:05:15
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:05:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ...physical tightness? 

01:05:15
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:05:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm, (crosstalk) 

01:05:15
SARAH It's not as strong but it's there. 

01:05:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm, again, with a little bit more focusing and so forth, we'd perhaps... (crosstalk) 

01:05:20
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:05:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...could recreate it. But you got at least for... (crosstalk) 

01:05:25
SARAH Yeah. 

01:05:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...this time, some beginning sense of it. 

01:05:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:05:25
ALLEN E. IVEY The feelings were recreated. And I think that's an important part in... (crosstalk) 

01:05:30
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:05:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...assertion training, role-playing is to recreate at least... (crosstalk) 

01:05:30
SARAH The feeling. 

01:05:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...some of the emotion as well as the verbal exchanges. 

01:05:35
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:05:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. So we've seen, what, what are some specific behaviors that you engaged in as we talk that ah,(crosstalk) 

01:05:45
SARAH Blocking, I was just blocking any response. That's what I really felt myself doing. 

01:05:50
ALLEN E. IVEY You're just not responding? 

01:05:50
SARAH  Yeah. 

01:05:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Leaving the room, so to speak. 

01:05:55
SARAH Yeah. 

01:05:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Not dealing with it. Leaving the... (crosstalk) 

01:05:55
SARAH Right. 

01:05:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...room. But you're not in the third grade anymore, is it? 

01:06:00
SARAH I know. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:06:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  So you're... (crosstalk) 

01:06:05
SARAH in some way... (crosstalk) 

01:06:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...not saying what you have wanted. (crosstalk) 

01:06:05
SARAH ...I wasn't saying anything. 

01:06:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:06:05
SARAH  But I also was not uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:06:10
ALLEN E. IVEY I also saw you looking away. 

01:06:10
SARAH I was looking away and I felt like I was kinda pulling away. 

01:06:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:06:15
SARAH  And uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:06:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

01:06:20
SARAH ...it was feel, feeling very fearful. 

01:06:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Feeling very fearful. 

01:06:25
SARAH Uhm, I'm not fearful of the other person, I'm fearful of myself. 

01:06:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Fearful of yourself? 

01:06:35
SARAH Uhm, be, saying what I want, which is to go, I go. (laughs) 

01:06:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Let go, yeah, is all the, shaking with. (crosstalk) 

01:06:45
SARAH Right. 

01:06:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. You'd like to just ah, let go. What will be, what will be the worst thing that happened if you actually said, let go? 

01:06:50
SARAH  The worst thing that could happen is to turn around and, and say to me, not, "I don't want to let go," but uhm, " Why, why do you want me to let go?" 

01:07:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:07:10
SARAH Then I would have to explain. That would the most. (crosstalk) 

01:07:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Or you ah, you have to explain? 

01:07:10
SARAH  Yes. 

01:07:15
ALLEN E. IVEY You would have to explain? 

01:07:15
SARAH Uh hmm, I would feel obligated to. 

01:07:15
ALLEN E. IVEY You've. (crosstalk) 

01:07:15
SARAH Obligated. 

01:07:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Obligated. Should explain(ph) ...(crosstalk) 

01:07:20
SARAH To explain. (laughing) 

01:07:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...you're back to the dream again. You feel obligated to explain, the eldest child... (crosstalk) 

01:07:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:07:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...Alfred Adler, speaks again. (laughs) 

01:07:25
SARAH Oh. (laughs) 

01:07:25
ALLEN E. IVEY I'm the eldest child. I understand. 

01:07:30
SARAH (laughing) So. (crosstalk) 

01:07:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  So you're obligated to explain your life, is that right? 

01:07:35
SARAH Right I have to have a good reason, you know, to say no. 

01:07:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh. 

01:07:35
SARAH  I guess (ph). 

01:07:40
ALLEN E. IVEY You don't, you can't do it just because you feel like it... (crosstalk) 

01:07:40
SARAH Right. 

01:07:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...is that right? Of course not and would you like to say no without a reason? That's my goal I've, I mean, I'm imposing it on you. 

01:07:50
SARAH But I like to be able to say no without a reason. 

01:07:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  It's my trip(ph), I don't know if it's yours. 

01:07:55
SARAH Hmm, that's a toughie. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:08:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  So it isn't just saying no. (crosstalk) 

01:08:05
SARAH I would like to be able to say no and feel that I didn't have to explain it in order to justify saying no. 

01:08:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:08:10
SARAH  I think it's important to know why I'm saying no, though. 

01:08:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay so let's ah, sometimes it's a case of success of approximations. You've identified you would like to be able to stake a position, I assume by the way, would you like to move the eye contact more direct? I think, it's part of being a little more assertive. 

01:08:30
SARAH Oh you mean do a face to face? 

01:08:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Face to face rather than looking away. I think that would be. (crosstalk) 

01:08:35
SARAH That might be more helpful. (crosstalk) 

01:08:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Be part of it. 

01:08:35
SARAH Yeah. 

01:08:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And ah, just, this time let's not we know ah, ah, it's a, one target might be a little more eye contact. Ah, maybe a little less blocking, which blocking means saying letting it come, whatever you say. 

01:08:50
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:08:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And I will throw in at some point some of the why is that. 

01:08:55
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:08:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. Should we try another role-play? 

01:08:55
SARAH Sure. 

01:08:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay Sarah ah, (crosstalk) 

01:09:00
SARAH Are we gonna face each other first? 

01:09:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, nice to see you again, ah, ah, how you've been doing? 

01:09:05
SARAH I doing very well. 

01:09:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Good. I'm glad to hear it. Things are going, look good for me. There's a new movie on over the Pleasant Street ah, I'd really like to go over there. How, how about going tomorrow? 

01:09:10
SARAH  I'm glad to hear that things are going well for you, can you tell me some of the things you've been doing? 

01:09:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uhm, well actually to be honest I really miss being with you. 

01:09:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:09:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And ah, I'd really would like to be with you, not really being going all that well. 

01:09:30
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:09:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And I really need to talk to you about it. And some things, I've been thinking again about some things in the group and we could just process a little bit more. 

01:09:35
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:09:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And Von Ducci's(ph) has a, some new stuff, I. 

01:09:40
SARAH Well uhm, I, I feel that I'm not the person to do that processing with you. 

01:09:45
ALLEN E. IVEY But, but Sarah, you know I, I really need to do it and we've done well in the past. I don't think it's a problem, it, it may sometimes it got a little tight. Maybe I got a little too pushy or you know, you know, bothers you a little bit but I think we can work it through, don't you? 

01:09:55
SARAH  I think that there, I think that you need to talk to somebody who's not involved with you about these things. I'm not the person. 

01:10:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Why? 

01:10:10
SARAH Because I feel like your trying to possess me and I don't want to be possessed. 

01:10:15
ALLEN E. IVEY That really hurts. 

01:10:20
SARAH I know. It's hard for me too. 

01:10:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Can we go out and talk about it? I think we ought to go talk now. Can we go now? 

01:10:25
SARAH No, I don't see any point... (crosstalk) 

01:10:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Why not now? 

01:10:25
SARAH ...in talking about it. I don't think anything's gonna be solved by it. 

01:10:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. I really, I really feel terrible. 

01:10:35
SARAH Uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:10:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, How you. (crosstalk) 

01:10:35
SARAH  I'm sorry that you feel terrible. (crosstalk) 

01:10:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. How are you doing? How are you feeling now? 

01:10:40
SARAH Uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:10:40
ALLEN E. IVEY About breaking up the. 

01:10:45
SARAH I still feel like I'm really aware that, that I'm putting a protection here so that I can't be... (crosstalk) 

01:10:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:10:50
SARAH ...hit here so I won't... (crosstalk) 

01:10:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:10:50
SARAH ...block. 

01:10:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:10:50
SARAH  Uhm, which to me, it means, I'm cutting off the feelings that I might... (crosstalk) 

01:11:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:11:00
SARAH ...have... (crosstalk) 

01:11:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:11:00
SARAH ...in order to say, to keep in touch with what I want to be doing. 

01:11:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. What are the feelings you're cutting off? 

01:11:05
SARAH  Uhm, feelings of wanting to take care and be for somebody and. (crosstalk) 

01:11:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, let me give you some, some feedback. 

01:11:15
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:11:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, you come across to me ah, just straightforward. 

01:11:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:11:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Taking a position. And saying that's a position. There also, is that whole business of, you know, we were both in the field, nonjudgmental. 

01:11:30
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:11:30
ALLEN E. IVEY This is my position. You can do what you want but I have my own position. 

01:11:35
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:11:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And it maybe very well be, I'll just raise the possibility, maybe it's good that your cutting off your nurturing feelings. 

01:11:40
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:11:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  If you wanna take that position. That maybe the price sometimes of taking out... (crosstalk) 

01:11:45
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:11:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...your own position, is letting that nurturing part of you go. How do you react to that? 

01:11:50
SARAH Well, it makes sense. It seems to me that it's really important to be able to make, instead of nurturing everybody and... (crosstalk) 

01:12:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:12:00
SARAH ...this is a hard one. This is, this is gonna be really hard because I have done some work around psychic healing... (crosstalk) 

01:12:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:12:10
SARAH ...which the concept of making yourself and, and, an ah, a picture that can't be emptied. 

01:12:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:12:20
SARAH Uhm, so that nobody can ever drain you. 

01:12:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:12:20
SARAH  And while in terms of energy, a person can't drain me in terms of uhm, how much I can really give to a person... (crosstalk) 

01:12:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:12:35
SARAH ...personally. I am, am limited by time and space. 

01:12:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:12:40
SARAH And I need to be able to sort through... (crosstalk) 

01:12:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Okay. 

01:12:45
SARAH ...which is important for me to invest, and which is not. 

01:12:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, now this is where I'm gonna interrupt ah, a little bit. We'll just do a little bit of theory with you and that is that I think behavioral techniques such as yours (inaudible [01:12:56.20]) are very wonderful for bringing up issues. And here... (crosstalk) 

01:12:55
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:12:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...we've brought up a new issue. I don't happen to feel personally, although I'm sure there's some behavioral therapist that would, that we could take this new issue you've raised around nurturance, the unfeel, the picture and so forth. This gets into a more... (crosstalk) 

01:13:05
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:13:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...than meaning issue... (crosstalk) 

01:13:10
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:13:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...then we can go back. To come up with behavioral stuff on that and ah, if we were doing a long term counseling, I might be inclined to pick that up. 

01:13:15
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:13:15
ALLEN E. IVEY I also, even so I would still, as I'm going to now, come back here to this specific assertion training... (crosstalk) 

01:13:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:13:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...issue. So I don't get off... (crosstalk) 

01:13:25
SARAH Yeah. 

01:13:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...farther. As I point out, that would be a sidetrack to what we are doing now. And I guess, I'd ask you the very hard question. Ah, how did you feel about yourself generally in responding to me as I'm talking, talking, trying to talk in this last session? 

01:13:40
SARAH I felt uncomfortable. 

01:13:40
ALLEN E. IVEY You felt uncomfortable. 

01:13:40
SARAH Uhm, but I also felt like I was taking care of myself. 

01:13:45
ALLEN E. IVEY You were taking care of yourself. 

01:13:45
SARAH  And uhm, respecting my own needs. 

01:13:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Respecting your own needs, taking care of yourself. (crosstalk) 

01:13:55
SARAH But respecting her, too. 

01:13:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And from the behavioral point of view, you were, your eye contact was more direct. I notice that you had to look down and right... (crosstalk) 

01:14:00
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:14:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...for support. Probably... (crosstalk) 

01:14:05
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:14:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...get in touch with those, what were you doing when your eyes are going down and right? 

01:14:05
SARAH  Uhm, keeping in touch with my feeling of my blocking off the, the feelings of attack to here. 

01:14:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm, do you find any support down there as well? 

01:14:20
SARAH Yeah. 

01:14:20
ALLEN E. IVEY What support were you finding? 

01:14:20
SARAH Uhm, it's mine. (laughs) 

01:14:25
ALLEN E. IVEY It's mine. I like it. (laughing) Very nice, very nice. So it is mine and you like it? 

01:14:35
SARAH  Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:14:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And ah, that maybe a feeling that maybe a body posture... (crosstalk) 

01:14:45
SARAH Yeah. 

01:14:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...you can use. 'Coz it is right there, why don't you just do it... (crosstalk) 

01:14:45
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:14:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  right now? How does it feel? 

01:14:50
SARAH It feels good. 

01:14:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm, you might wanna think about using that particular behavior. 

01:14:55
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:14:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, and you may wanna think also, we could go on in many different ways. 

01:15:05
SARAH Oh yeah. 

01:15:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, that, so instead of, you, identified some specific behavior changes in terms of, if we look to a roll back in the videotape, we'd see (inaudible [01:15:13.08]) indifference. If I were really getting into assertion training, we'd do two or three more role-plays of this... (crosstalk) 

01:15:15
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:15:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ...I don't mind to do that now 'coz this is a demonstration to intensify and meet the directions. If I were doing... (crosstalk) 

01:15:20
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:15:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  psychotherapy, we'd be introducing some of these other things as well but in terms of what we've talked about ah, I do talk about generalization and I think, Alan Marlatt, in his relapse prevention, he really talked about the importance, insight, learning, practice and the interview it doesn't mean anything unless it's taken outside. Do we make a contract now for you to maybe do one thing differently next week? And I'd like to follow you up on this. Okay. What one thing might you do differently as a result of this assertion training practice? 

01:15:50
[sil.] 

01:15:50
SARAH  Uhm, I might. (crosstalk) 

01:15:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  You might. 

01:16:00
SARAH I've got a postcard from her. 

01:16:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:16:05
SARAH Uhm, I might write her back ah, I think I'd wait until she wrote me again. I'm not, I'm not gonna hurry that one just yet. 

01:16:15
ALLEN E. IVEY So... (crosstalk) 

01:16:15
SARAH My diplomatic side is. (crosstalk) 

01:16:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ...one thing your gonna do is not answering? Okay. 

01:16:20
SARAH What. (crosstalk) 

01:16:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay ah, I'd like to ah, just ask you as we wind up here now. If you have you any particular observation, Anything you might wanna share with ah, the world at large(ph)? 

01:16:30
SARAH To share with the world at large, I mean about this whole process here. 

01:16:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:16:35
SARAH Uhm, this is a very interesting process and... (crosstalk) 

01:16:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:16:40
SARAH ...and we don't have enough time to really go into it. So many things have been going off in the background. 

01:16:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:16:45
SARAH  Uhm, tying a lot of things together and, and I see a lot more areas for, for uhm, work. 

01:16:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:16:55
SARAH  Uhm, and I'm very interest, I, I haven't been ah, a big fan of, of the ah, assertion, assertion training... (crosstalk) 

01:17:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:17:10
SARAH ...and the role-playing but I am really seeing how valuable it is, (crosstalk) 

01:17:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:17:15
SARAH uhm, it's something that would be interesting to work on more. 

01:17:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:17:20
SARAH I also, I'm aware of how I'm not that in tune with your techniques especially when we did the dream and... (crosstalk) 

01:17:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:17:30
SARAH ...analysis. I was not as aware of the techniques. I was really caught up in the image. 

01:17:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:17:35
SARAH Uhm, in the D reflection, I really felt there wasn't enough time to really develop it enough. 

01:17:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:17:45
SARAH And I felt that that was missing. 

01:17:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:17:45
SARAH Uhm, that so I, from my own person, you say that I see how it takes time... (crosstalk) 

01:17:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:17:55
SARAH ...to build up and build into those... (crosstalk) 

01:17:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:17:55
SARAH ...uhm, techniques. Uhm, I, the assertion training really bre, even though it's supposed to be behavioral, for me brings up all kinds of... (crosstalk) 

01:18:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:18:10
SARAH ...my little thought process, processes around, why I think I shouldn't be able to ah, assert myself or I should, what my needs aren't valid and those are all areas that I'd love to explore. 

01:18:20
ALLEN E. IVEY It's interesting to me to see again some of the words appearing... (crosstalk) 

01:18:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:18:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...from the dream analysis and some... (crosstalk) 

01:18:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:18:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...it's actually some of the behaviors showing up there... (crosstalk) 

01:18:25
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:18:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...which are described... (crosstalk) 

01:18:30
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:18:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, more abstractly in the, in the... (crosstalk) 

01:18:30
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:18:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...dream analysis. Ah, so that you've found assertion training more as source of... (crosstalk) 

01:18:35
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:18:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...thoughts and insights than you thought it would be. 

01:18:35
SARAH  Uh hmm. 

01:18:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:18:40
SARAH And the other thing that I find very interesting is I, I told you earlier I often would take a key something from a dream and draw it and just let the draw evolve... (crosstalk) 

01:18:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

01:18:45
SARAH ...drawing evolve on its own. And then I will put those drawings up in my bedroom and I look at them well, quite often and it's interesting to me that although I get a symbolic and pictorial image by going through the other processes with it. 

01:19:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:19:00
SARAH It ties into conscious. 

01:19:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:19:05
SARAH And uhm, I almost wanna say tangible... (crosstalk) 

01:19:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:19:10
SARAH ...activities whereas dreams are imaginary and intangible and it's interesting to experience the two of those getting put together like. 

01:19:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:19:20
SARAH And what that means, how that is back and forth. 

01:19:25
ALLEN E. IVEY If you wanna get in to theory, I think the visual stuff, is imagery... (crosstalk) 

01:19:30
SARAH Hmm. 

01:19:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...tends to be sometimes a little intellectual. 

01:19:30
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:19:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  We're doing at least auditory stuff 'coz I'm imitating directions while I see you get in... (crosstalk) 

01:19:35
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:19:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...become the kinesthetic movements... (crosstalk) 

01:19:35
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:19:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  et cetera. The auditory visual kinesthetic tends to heighten the... (crosstalk) 

01:19:40
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:19:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...experience. And at any point we could've heightened the ah, the reflection if I would have said see your, see the, see the teacher there, hear her voice, (crosstalk) 

01:19:50
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:19:50
ALLEN E. IVEY get with the feelings. That would have heightened it. 

01:19:55
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:19:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And ah, and I think, I, I made a conscious choice. I did not want to move that level and intensity. One, because it takes a lot longer time... (crosstalk) 

01:20:00
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:20:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...for the demonstration. And I think the, you kept this whole series I think a rather relatively visual level. 

01:20:05
SARAH  Uh-huh. 

01:20:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Until we got to the assertion training. 

01:20:10
SARAH I think it's important too, that the things that happened to me in the third grade are, are slightly out of context. 

01:20:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:20:20
SARAH Whereas doing the here and now issues are much more contextual. They're easier for me to... (crosstalk) 

01:20:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:20:25
SARAH ...tune into and uhm, it's much easier to translate when I get out of the session... (crosstalk) 

01:20:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh. 

01:20:35
SARAH ...between you and I into the present. 

01:20:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Now that's very good feedback ah, this gets into the whole realm I say that a counselor or therapist has to have several different theories available just bring that two fact to me if I were to do the D-reflection demonstration again the order might have been better, in your case psychodynamic assertion training and then do the D-reflection around to here and now 'coz you actually... (crosstalk) 

01:20:55
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:20:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ... had the same strengths in dealing with Gretchen(ph)... (crosstalk) 

01:20:55
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:20:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...that you had in the third grade but they're hearing now, tangible... (crosstalk) 

01:21:00
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:21:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...rather than back there and then. 

01:21:00
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:21:00
ALLEN E. IVEY You could do, do either one. 

01:21:05
SARAH Uh hmm. 

01:21:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Would you think that might've made with D reflection a little bit more useful for you? 

01:21:05
SARAH Yeah. That might've. 

01:21:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  Might've. 

01:21:10
SARAH Might've. 

01:21:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

01:21:10
SARAH But, you know, this is the way did. (laughs) 

01:21:10
ALLEN E. IVEY This is the way we did it. 

01:21:10
SARAH The other, I have one other comment to make and that was uhm, I don't think you did it, you said it to me when are on tape and that was you said try to just let go of the blocks. 

01:21:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:21:25
SARAH Or maybe you did say it and just... (crosstalk) 

01:21:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:21:25
SARAH ...say what's going on, don't block. 

01:21:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:21:30
SARAH And just saying that really encouraged me, supported me... (crosstalk) 

01:21:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:21:35
SARAH ...to let go of that and just do it. 

01:21:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:21:35
SARAH ...and uhm, I might have not flowed in as easily. 

01:21:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:21:40
SARAH So that kind of, it's almost an affirmation... (crosstalk) 

01:21:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:21:45
SARAH ...or an acknowledgement. That kind of acknowledgement, I findvery helpful and I want to, that was a good technique, I liked that one. (Laughs) 

01:21:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Great. Okay. (Laughs) With that I think we'll sign off. 

01:21:55
SARAH Okay. 

01:21:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Thanks so much, Sarah. 

01:21:55
SARAH Thank you. 

01:21:55
ALLEN E. IVEY I appreciate it.
