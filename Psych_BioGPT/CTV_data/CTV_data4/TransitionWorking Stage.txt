KENT Well, I'll start it off since I did at the, at the beginning. (crosstalk) 

00:01:15
EDDIE Okay. 

00:01:15
KENT Uhm, somewhat more relaxed than I did at the beginning of, of the session. I'm, I'm still surprised at no matter how many groups you lead ah, with, when you start one, it's just always a little apprehensive in, in getting started as a little more difficult than you anticipate. 

00:01:30
Jamie 

00:01:30
JAMIE  Part of me feels some, feels for you that you're having trouble being late but part of me is real angry, too. And I think we have a right to be angry. 'Coz I came here to work on my issues and, and I'm sorry, Eddie and, and Kent, but I feel like we're all, we're focusing on John all the time and here, I sit here, week after week and I'm trying to make decisions, too. 

00:01:55
Jeff 

00:01:55
JEFF I don't know, I don't, I don't wanna upset people, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:02:00
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:02:00
JEFF ...in here. 

00:02:00
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:02:00
JEFF But, uhm, I don't know, on, on the one hand, I guess it has lot to do with, with me and my education or my lack of education, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:02:10
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:02:10
JEFF uhm, having left high school and I think that's kind of something that distances me, to me, apart from everybody else in here and. 

00:02:20
Katie 

00:02:20
KATIE  A lot of my want for the perfect career choice isn't mine. It's my mother's. 

00:02:25
JAMIE Oh. 

00:02:25
UNKNOWN  And yeah, I've been worried way too much, pushed to be the big plant. As big and full and powerful as it can be, you know. And yeah, when I said I want to do the best thing, it wasn't for me, it's because I wanna make her proud, too. 

00:02:45
The Association for Specialists in Group Work Presents The Group: Moving Through Transition to the Working Stage Dr. Rex Stockton Indiana University 

00:02:45
DR. REX STOCKTON  Welcome to the second segment in our developmental aspects of group counseling, process, leadership, and supervision series. The first videotape focused around the groups beginning. The ice was broken, group norms were discussed and the member sets some goals. As I mentioned in the last tape, the beginning phase last for more than one session. But for our purposes, let's skip ahead and look at the next phase which is transition. This stage is often characterized by highly charged emotional issues. Here, the leader's task is to help the members resolve the issues related to this phase in order for the group to move toward a therapeutic working stage. Group leaders will not find this transition process smooth sailing. In this tape, we will show you a number of vignettes that will illustrate many of the difficulties encountered by leaders in the creation of a working group. Members will tend to want to stay in, an advice-giving mode. To move deeper, they will need to look at their own anxiety, defensiveness, and resistance. They will deal with control and power issues, member conflict, and trust issues. You will see not only the group struggle to find itself, but will also watch our leaders undergo their own struggle to understand the group and their role within this process. One task that a group leader needs to think about before each session, is how to start the group in a way that links the previous session to the current one. And encourages the members to bring up their issues and begin working. In the next vignette, watch how Kent begins a group session by asking members about unfinished business from the week before. 

00:04:30
Transition Stage: Member Conflict 

00:04:30
KENT  Oh, well, it's so nice to have, uhm, have you back. Look likes ah, John is not here, yet. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:04:45
EDDIE We haven't heard from him, so, we can assume, I guess that he will be in shortly. 

00:04:50
Kent Co - Leader 

00:04:50
KENT All right. Soon, he will be here. Uhm, we will go ahead and get started. I'm wondering if there's any unfinished business from last week or something that came up this week... (crosstalk) 

00:05:00
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:05:00
KENT ...that ah, that ah, someone would like to, to share with the group. 

00:05:05
Doug 

00:05:05
DOUG This week has been real difficult. I'm, I'm not sure why, I guess may be that's a part ah, we talked about goals earlier. I guess that's part of the reason why I'm here, but it, ah, the business has gone real well this week. Ah, no problems with personnel or sales or anything else. But yet, in fact, we got, we got a, an award from the city this week... (crosstalk) 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:05:30
DOUG ...ah, that would make, you know, would make most people feel real good. And ah, I just got absolutely no, I didn't get any kind of kick out of it at all. 

00:05:40
UNKNOWN Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:05:40
KENT Hmm. 

00:05:40
DOUG And uhm, I don't know, it's just, it's just, it's just a doggone hard to keep going through these things and, and getting all this positive reinforcement on the outside. Ah, and just wondering... (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
EDDIE And... (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
DOUG ...why, why, why didn't it. (crosstalk) 

00:06:00
EDDIE ...sounds like the kinds of things you know would please other people just starts, aren't satisfactory enough for you anymore. Just, it isn't quite enough. 

00:06:05
DOUG Or I don't know if they ever were. (crosstalk) 

00:06:05
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:06:05
DOUG I really don't know that they ever were... (crosstalk) 

00:06:10
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:06:10
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:06:10
DOUG ...uhm, I thought they would be... (crosstalk) 

00:06:10
EDDIE Uh hmm 

00:06:10
DOUG ...at one point. And ah, you know, the, the, the business has been a tremendous success. Ah, it's been able to provide myself and my family with a lot of things, a lot of things, 

00:06:20
EDDIE Uh hmm 

00:06:20
DOUG  you know ah. 

00:06:25
JEFF So, are you saying that the business is a success, but you're not? 

00:06:30
[sil.] 

00:06:30
DOUG  No, no, I mean, no because I, I, you know, everything I've been involved in has been successful. I've been real lucky in that respect. Uhm, but it's just I'm not getting any kinda, I'm not getting any kinda kick out of it. I'm not getting any kind of reinforcement back from it. It just didn't make a lot of difference to me. It's like we'll, so what if our projections go way up there, you know. I mean... (crosstalk) 

00:06:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:06:55
DOUG ...other than and then providing those things and those needs, it just doesn't make a whole a lot of difference to me anymore. And I don't, I don't understand it. (crosstalk) 

00:07:05
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:07:05
DOUG I really don't because I thought that was kind of what, you know, we were suppose to be basing things on, success, you know. It was a part of this meeting those goals and everything... (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:07:15
DOUG ...else. And ah, I don't know. It, it uhm, it's been real lack, been real lacking.(crosstalk) 

00:07:20
EDDIE Jeff, it's sound like the question you were asking Doug also, had some meaning for you that there's something you can relate to about what Doug is saying. 

00:07:25
JEFF Oh, with my work, you know, I am kind of I'm in a mana, management level, as assistant manager. But I'm not the manager, I'm not the owner, you know. And if we have ten more cars in one week... (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
JOHN Excuse, sorry, I'm sorry. (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
JEFF ...then, then uhm, what we had last week... (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
DOUG Uh hmm 

00:07:45
JEFF ...I mean, I might get a pat on the back, but no more money was in my pocket or... (crosstalk) 

00:07:50
DOUG Yeah. 

00:07:50
JEFF ...or things for my family and so, I mean, I, I feel like I would, kind of take it better that pat on, you know, that raise projection you're talking about. I would take that... (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
UNKNOWN Oh, yes. 

00:08:00
JEFF ...a lot better if I were the owner... (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
UNKNOWN Uh hmm 

00:08:00
JEFF ...if I were the boss. 

00:08:00
DR. REX STOCKTON  Now, watch what happens when the leaders let John takes center stage. 

00:08:05
John 

00:08:05
JOHN Guys, I'm sorry I'm late. (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:08:10
JOHN I'd, I wanna get it over and talking and I'm just ah, I got tied up. I'm sorry. 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:08:10
JOHN  So, it just was hard for me to get here today on time. 

00:08:20
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:08:20
JOHN  Ah, yeah, things are, things have not uhm, ah, been going that great and... (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:08:30
JOHN ...ah, I couldn't ah, I, I couldn't get here in today, I and sure enoughs, the same problem, I just got stuck in traffic. And ah, I tried to call, but I, I mean, I knew you guys were already started so I'm, (crosstalk) 

00:08:45
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:08:45
JOHN I'm sorry. It's just sort of have been a bad, bad time lately. 

00:08:50
KENT Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN Have you tried any of the things we suggested a couple of weeks ago? I mean, have they been working better at all with work? 

00:08:55
JEFF Did you try going even talk to your boss by any chance? 

00:08:55
JOHN  That is the one thing I really thought about doing. And every time I tried to do it, I, I, I couldn't do it 'coz I was always late. And uhm, it, it sounds, I know it sounds like I'm not trying, it, it sounds to me like I'm not trying, it's like none of this stuff worked. (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
JEFF  It sounds a lot like, like what we heard last week when you were late. 

00:09:20
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:09:20
DOUG You know, there's, there's an awful a lot of can'ts and won'ts or, or rather a lot of can'ts coming out of you and I, I just wonder if those can'ts are won'ts. 

00:09:30
EDDIE John, how do you feel when Doug tells you that? 

00:09:30
JOHN  Like he doesn't understand. 

00:09:35
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:09:35
DOUG What, that should be pretty clear, I mean, I don't... (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
JOHN What? 

00:09:35
DOUG  understand it. 

00:09:40
JOHN You know, I can't help this. I, I. (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
MARGARET But is that being fair to John, we've already talked about our, what our goals are go, and John's goal has been to be able to get to work on time. 

00:09:45
DOUG  Is, is what fair to John? 

00:09:50
MARGARET Well, just to ah, to assume or to, I guess to be so angry with him. Ah, he know, he, he knows it's a problem, we know its problem and you're being angry, doesn't help if anything it probably... (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
DOUG Well, (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
MARGARET ...makes him worst. 

00:10:05
DOUG it may, Margaret, but nothing else is making any difference, so, what difference does it make? 

00:10:10
Jamie 

00:10:10
JAMIE I think that's the whole point and I, part of me feels some, feels for you that you're having trouble being late, but part of me is real angry, too. And I think we have a right to be angry 'coz I came here to work on my issues and, and I'm sorry, Eddie, and, and Kent, but I feel like we're all, we're focusing on John all the time. And here, I sit here week after week and I'm trying to make decisions, too. And, and, and I'm dealing with his problem all the time. I'm listening to this... (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:10:35
JAMIE ...and, and I wonder what, what's in it for us? 

00:10:40
EDDIE Jamie, if I understand what you're saying is that you feel real frustrated with the amount of time which, that's get spend on John's issue that you're not getting the attention you feel like you'd like to get out of... (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
JAMIE Well, yeah. 

00:10:50
EDDIE ...the group right now. I think I'm hearing that from, well, almost all of you. 

00:10:55
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:10:55
JAMIE I just think that his lateness is starting to control the group... (crosstalk) 

00:10:55
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:10:55
JAMIE  and, and because John was late today, this is what we're talking about. We were talking about something, you guys were talking about your careers. It's the first time, I've heard you even started talking, Jeff, where I, where I know what's going on. You come in late... (crosstalk) 

00:11:10
JOHN Well. (crosstalk) 

00:11:10
JAMIE ...and the focus totally turns... (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
JOHN Look. (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
JAMIE ...on you and we don't, and we don't get to any other business. It's just that his lateness is starting to control what goes on in here. 

00:11:20
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:11:20
JOHN Well, all right, fine, you know, I am trying my best and I'm not getting anywhere. I, I'm not getting anywhere, I can't help it, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:11:30
DOUG But we don't see you get anything. 

00:11:30
JOHN and I'm just getting jumped on here and I'm, you know, I don't need this, you know, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
KATIE Can't you guys do something, I mean, this is a little, I mean... (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
JOHN You know, I. (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
KATIE ...I feel ungentle with him. 

00:11:40
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:11:40
KENT It sounds like there's a lot of frustrations in the room right now... (crosstalk) 

00:11:45
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:11:45
KENT ...from everybody. 

00:11:45
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:11:45
DOUG  Well, I, yeah, there's anger here. I mean, there's tension here. There's no question about it. (crosstalk) 

00:11:55
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:11:55
DOUG Uhm, you know, I, I was unclear what was going on in this group to begin with. Ah, I finally, you know, we're, we're finally starting to get some interaction here, getting some talk... (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:12:05
DOUG ...and you know, we're right back with the same old thing and why don't you, I mean, there's got to be something more than what's going on here. I mean, it, it's... (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
JOHN Well. 

00:12:10
DOUG ...not just a matter, it can't be just a matter of you being nervous about going to work. What is the deal here? There's something more than that... (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
JOHN Well, I don't know. 

00:12:20
DOUG ...that's keeping you from going to work. 

00:12:20
JOHN I, I don't know. I wish I knew. I don't know. (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
JAMIE I think, I think it's just attention. I mean that's my opinion. I think it's a way for you to get attention from us, you know. I, I just feel like when, when you do this, I feel like it's your way of getting attention from people. I don't think it's that high, I don't think is that positive, but it's attention. 

00:12:40
MARGARET I think that the first thing is to recognize that the reason John has been the center of attention is because we as members have allowed him to be the center of attention. 

00:12:50
KENT What would be helpful ah, for other members? How, how... (crosstalk) 

00:12:50
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:12:50
KENT  can we work through this difficulty we're having right now? Any suggestions? 

00:12:55
DR. REX STOCKTON  Let's stop here. In your work, particularly at the beginning of your career, you will find that things don't always go well or according to plan. As you can see, both our group and our leaders are stuck. Supervision during transition should focus upon helping the leaders develop their repertoire of, of intervention strategies. Leaders need to understand and accept the members' resistance as a normal developmental process. Members need the leaders help to work through the fears that are the source of this resistance. Leaders also must acknowledge group conflict and help the members explore its source. Early in the transition stage, the leaders themselves are often openly challenged- 

00:13:40
Response to leader challenge 

00:13:40
REX STOCKTON - while this is not a pleasant experience, leaders must learn how to avoid becoming defensive and respond openly. It may be that during this stormy, emotional transition stage, the beginning leaders have the greatest difficulty in taking the risk to make a therapeutic intervention. It is here that the supervisor must take care to provide helpful, corrective feedback while being supportive and encouraging. Let's take a short look at the beginning of the subsequent leader supervision and then we'll talk more about this session. 

00:14:10
Transition Stage: Supervision 

00:14:10
KENT  It's very difficult to share uhm, negative feelings with people, isn't it? 

00:14:30
EDDIE It's a very risky thing to do... (crosstalk) 

00:14:30
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:14:30
EDDIE  and you've all taken some pretty big risks tonight... (crosstalk) 

00:14:35
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:14:35
EDDIE ...sharing those angry, blaming kinds of statements and feelings towards one another that's a very tough thing to do. 

00:14:40
KENT Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Oh, I think as we close tonight, I've wanted to, you know, just encourage you to think about the ways in which you can uhm, do you have shared those feelings? Each of you has managed to share honest, difficult emotions with everybody else. And it all, ah, ah, and how that, and how risky that is and how scary that is... (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:15:10
KENT  and that uhm, next week when we come back may be we can take a closer look at, at some of the conflicts we have going on in here. And, and may be make some progress in that direction. 

00:15:25
DR. REX STOCKTON  Okay. 

00:15:30
KENT Hmm. 

00:15:30
DR. REX STOCKTON  All right. Had a fully. (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
EDDIE (sighs) Yeah. 

00:15:35
KENT That was a, quite a group and. (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
EDDIE I don't even feel a lot better after watching it than I did... (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
KENT No. 

00:15:40
EDDIE ...after being part of it... (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm 

00:15:40
EDDIE  even though some time was passed, but.(crosstalk) 

00:15:45
REX STOCKTON A lot of things happened. 

00:15:45
KENT Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
EDDIE Yeah. 

00:15:45
DR. REX STOCKTON Starting with ah, a member late... (crosstalk) 

00:15:50
KENT Uh hmm. Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:15:50
EDDIE Uh hmm 

00:15:50
REX STOCKTON ...when some, when some good work was being take, taking place. 

00:15:50
EDDIE  Uh hmm 

00:15:55
DR. REX STOCKTON Uhm, John seem to captivate your attention, along with the others 

00:16:00
EDDIE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:16:00
DR. REX STOCKTON Were you aware of the fact that you left Jeff hanging there in a. 

00:16:05
EDDIE Was, (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
KENT Yeah. 

00:16:05
EDDIE we were aware of it that... (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:16:05
EDDIE ...that it wasn't finished and yet, I would felt very awkward about how to get back to it and still acknowledge... (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
DR. REX STOCKTON  Uh hmm 

00:16:15
EDDIE ...John's coming in and what was going on. (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
DR. REX STOCKTON One way you might do that is simply acknowledged that John has arrived... (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
EDDIE Hmm. 

00:16:20
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:16:20
DR. REX STOCKTON ...and then get back to Jeff... (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
KENT Right. 

00:16:20
DR. REX STOCKTON ...finish up with Jeff and then go back to John. 

00:16:25
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
DR. REX STOCKTON So. (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
EDDIE That seem so easy, so I'm not sure why... (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm 

00:16:30
EDDIE ...it didn't happen that way uhm, I mean, it just seem so obvious that's why we could (inaudible) (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
DR. REX STOCKTON  If I had a guess to make, it would be because you got thrown off... (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
EDDIE Yeah. 

00:16:35
DR. REX STOCKTON ...by his coming in, sort of captivating... (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:16:35
DR. REX STOCKTON ...taking, taking charge with the kind of uhm, charm, here I am, (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:16:40
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:16:40
DR. REX STOCKTON sorry I'm late. 

00:16:40
EDDIE  Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:16:45
KENT Yeah, and, and I, I'm not so sure that, there, there wasn't some, uhm, is the resentment on my part that he in fact was late and that... (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
EDDIE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:16:55
KENT ...hadn't called ahead and, and that this was something that we were to deal with or gonna need to deal with... (crosstalk) 

00:17:00
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:17:00
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:17:00
KENT ...and. (crosstalk) 

00:17:00
DR. REX STOCKTON That seems to be one of his presenting problems. 

00:17:05
KENT Right. (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:17:05
KENT And, and sort of the whole idea about, you know, finishing off with what's going on and then moving on or... (crosstalk) 

00:17:10
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:17:10
KENT  acknowledging and then moving, you know, just, I just was thrown and I think that, uhm, I, I don't feel like I, I handle that, that very well. 

00:17:25
DR. REX STOCKTON Well, that's why you're in a training program. 

00:17:25
EDDIE And I think that's the, the members really let us know that we didn't handle... (crosstalk) 

00:17:25
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:17:25
EDDIE  very well, (laughs) you know. (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
KENT Right. Yeah. Exactly. 

00:17:30
DR. REX STOCKTON Well, this was certainly ah, leaders you're not doing-so-well-night then. 

00:17:30
EDDIE Yeah. 

00:17:30
DR. REX STOCKTON  As you can see, the leaders were very much aware of their lack of skillfulness. While it is true that the group certainly was at a point where members often question and confront leaders, Kent and Eddie's own confusion made the situation even more awkward. During supervision, a great deal of time was spent helping the leaders make sense out of the session. We discussed how they could have used additional individual and group process interventions. For example, they could have made more process interventions with individual members, such as when Eddie focused in upon Jamie's frustrations and not getting the attention from the group that she would like to get or they could increase the number of process statements at the group level. A good example of this type of intervention is when Kent said, "It seems like there's a lot of frustrations in the room right now from everybody." We also worked on other leadership skills. Perhaps, most importantly, I reassured them of the resiliency of the group process and that leadership improves with experience and reflection. Now, let's look at the next session. Here, the leaders need to deal with a member who is resistant. As you watch this vignette, remember that transition by its very nature is awkward. We will see that the energy level is quite different from the previous session. There also will be a lot of tentativeness. Watch how the leaders worked with this. 

00:18:50
Transition Stage: Working with Member Resistance 

00:18:50
KENT  Well, it's ah, good to see you back here this week. As you noticed ah, tsk, ah, Jamie and ah, Jeff aren't here. They called just before group started and ah, said ah, ah, Jamie's child is sick right now, and she won't be able to ah, be here. And ah, Jeff is uhm, got caught at work and having to work overtime... (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:19:25
KENT  so, I'm wondering ah, we've had really good attendance, ah, I don't think, I think this is the first time, John you were late once? 

00:19:35
JOHN  Yeah. 

00:19:40
KENT But this is the first time ah, since we've started it that anybody is missed... (crosstalk) 

00:19:40
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:19:40
KENT ...and we have two people missing. I'm wondering uhm, tsk, if ah, how people feel about that. 

00:19:50
Katie 

00:19:50
KATIE Well, I'm not too please rather I mean, I'm here and I've always... (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:19:55
KATIE ...come. I mean, I guess I can understand it for kid sick, but I've been sick all week and I'm still here. 

00:20:00
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:20:00
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:20:00
DOUG  It feels kinda odd, just feels kind of strange without, without everybody else being here, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:20:10
DOUG I'm just saying they can be here, but sometimes those things happen, if they can't get here, so. 

00:20:15
Margaret 

00:20:15
MARGARET  Well, I am, I'm sorry they're not here either but I understand, you know, when you have a job, you have to do what, what's expected of you and I understand being a mother, that if one my children was sick, I would definitely be at home. 

00:20:30
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:20:30
KATIE  Just made it hard, you know. 

00:20:35
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:20:35
EDDIE How do you think that might affect things differently for you in the group today with two people absent? 

00:20:40
KATIE I don't know if I'd be as willing to talk as much, I don't know. 

00:20:45
UNKNOWN Uhm. 

00:20:45
EDDIE  It sound like you're already a little bit, you rather said, you said you're not sure you'd be willing to talk more but even, you're, I mean, with hearing you. What can the group do to, help you feel a little more comfortable to start talking? What would have to happen? 

00:21:00
KATIE  Well, I'd like it that these two were here but I guess that's not possible. 

00:21:05
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:21:05
DR. REX STOCKTON Katie is finding it very difficult to begin sharing with the group. Watch how Kent helps her to focus in upon the members she trust the most. 

00:21:15
KENT I'm wondering, Katie, if you can share with Margaret. Let's make a connection with Margaret about what you were wanting to bring in the group tonight as a way of ah, maybe getting started and so let's, and take the risk of sharing. 

00:21:30
KATIE  I guess the big thing, it goes back to when I came in the group with about not knowing where I'm going with my career. I mean, should I go to grad school or should I get a job. I mean, what should I do. I just, I've talked to professors. I've talked to different people of different jobs about positions I could take and I just, I can't cope with any answers that I want. Nothing feels right. You know I just, (crosstalk) 

00:22:00
KENT Feel a little stuck? 

00:22:00
KATIE Yeah. 

00:22:00
KENT  Where are you at now in. (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
KATIE Yeah, I'm graduating soon here and I need to do something. 

00:22:10
KENT Uh hmm. So, how can Margaret be helpful to you? 

00:22:15
KATIE  Give me some advice on what to do. 

00:22:20
KENT Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:22:20
MARGARET  Oh, boy, that seems funny 'coz I'm looking for advice myself. Uhm, I mean, I can understand what you're saying, uhm, but I really can't uhm, it, it sounds like you almost said you want, you want us to tell you what to do, and that's something different. I can understand where you're at, and I can understand your dilemma but, but yet, I can't tell you what to do. 

00:22:50
KATIE Okay. 

00:22:50
KENT  You seem a little reluctant to give her advice so, and I'm wondering if that's, uhm, because it might not be helpful at this point or that maybe there isn't anyone could answer one true answer. 

00:23:10
MARGARET I guess it, prob, probably because there isn't any, probably one good answer because I, I get the feeling that Katie wants me, or wants us to tell her what to do, so that if it doesn't work out... (crosstalk) 

00:23:25
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:23:25
MARGARET ...she can say, "Oh, if I didn't listen to Margaret, if I didn't listen to Doug, if I didn't listen to John, I wouldn't be in this fix... (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
KENT Hmm. Hmm. 

00:23:35
MARGARET ...and I may be wrong but that's just, you said you listen to all the, you talked to all of these professors and they would know more about you in terms of, you know, academically as I more than I know, I don't know about other group members, so, for you to say, "Tell me what to do.", I just think... (crosstalk) 

00:23:50
KENT Hmm. 

00:23:50
MARGARET ...you want someone else to put the blame on. 

00:23:50
KENT Uh hmm. And check that out if that's what's going on. 

00:23:55
MARGARET Am I, do you feel that you want someone else to assume that responsibility for you? 

00:24:00
KATIE Well, maybe not to take the blame but maybe just to give me some better answers. I mean, academically, I can do it, I mean, that's not a problem. 

00:24:05
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:24:05
JOHN I agree with Margaret. I mean, I can't see ah, I can't see sitting here giving you a lot of advice about what to do, where to go. Uhm, what are you scared of? I mean, I mean, what are your, what are some of your fears? 'Coz you, you, you haven't made, you know. 

00:24:25
KATIE That I'll make a choice and then I'll hate it, and I wasted all that time dealing with that choice. You see that it happens so many times with people. 

00:24:35
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:24:35
KATIE  And it makes me wonder, you know, if I could get locked into some job that I think I'll like for a while and... (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
KENT  Uh hmm. 

00:24:45
KATIE ...eventually, you know, look up and say, you know, this isn't what I wanted at all. (crosstalk) 

00:24:45
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:24:45
KATIE  And wish I did the other. (crosstalk) 

00:24:50
EDDIE This seems like there's a fear being trapped once you, once you make a decision that could feel comfortable now and find out later that wasn't what you wanted and. (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
KATIE  And there was always more that I do want. 

00:25:00
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:25:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:25:00
EDDIE It seems like an interesting dilemma that you're presenting because my sense is right now, you so many opportunities, so many choices that you're having difficulty deciding among the many choices, but the true fear is once I make this choice, then there are no additional choices. 

00:25:15
KATIE I'm not scared of making decisions, I'm scared of making the wrong... (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
JOHN Yeah. 

00:25:20
KATIE ...decision. 

00:25:20
DR. REX STOCKTON Eddie was able to pick up on the fear underlying Katie's need for advice. She then goes on to explore this fear with Katie. Let's keep ahead in the session to a point where the leaders recognize that Katie is clearly resistant to the deeper meaning of her dilemma, and that it is time to move on. Kent and Eddie have been aware of Margaret's increasing frustration with Katie. Let's watch as they work together to move the group's focus from Katie to Margaret. Be sure to notice the individual process statements that Eddie makes to help Margaret get in touch with her deeper issues. 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN How long is it through. 

00:25:55
MARGARET But how can you determine, it, it seems like what you're saying is, you're in your 20s and you're trying to make a decision about a career. And you're saying, "I wanna make a decision today, it's a 22 years old, that at 40 years of age, I will, I'll be happy with. " You want a storybook life, you just don't get it. Well, Katie, I just, I'm just so frustrated, I get so frustrated listening to you because I keep thinking you're, you know, you're 19 years old and wanna live the rest of your life with decisions you'll make in the next few years. and I guess, I get frustrated with you because I, I realize how frustrated I am in terms of looking at my own life and all the decisions I've made and where I am now. And uhm, I just know that you can't do it. I think about 20 something years ago when I was at school and you know, I wanted to have a professional career, then I married, and I had to decide, did I want a career or did I want a family, did I wanna be a homemaker. And I chose to do that. Now, I look at it, I'm a widow, I'm, I'm starting over, so I could say today. Boy, if 25 years ago, I had decided to continue to be a teacher and a homemaker, I wouldn't be trying to ah, start all over the day. 

00:27:15
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:27:15
MARGARET So, you know, whatever you do, you're gonna, you know, it just can't be done and I, I just, I don't know, I just feel so, I feel sorry for you in a way because I realize you can't live the rest of your life in the next few years, but I also recognize that I can't tell you that, Doug can't tell you that, John can't tell you that, you've got to recognize that yourself, and maybe that's what I'm, (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:27:40
MARGARET I just wish I could just make you understand that but I can't. You have to realize that yourself. 

00:27:45
KENT So, the frustration is not only with Katie but things are going... (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
MARGARET Yeah, just. (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
KENT ...with your own life and, and how frustrating it is to be stuck. 

00:27:55
MARGARET To be stuck... (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
KENT And. (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
MARGARET ...but to recognize that, uhm, it's just a point that we're going through that, and, with I, I guess realized that's what I felt, this is a point where I am and I'm gonna have to move forward, too. 

00:28:05
Eddie Co-Leader 

00:28:05
EDDIE I always get the feeling you, you had that since when you Katie's age that everything was gonna be okay... (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
MARGARET Yeah. 

00:28:10
EDDIE ...with all the decisions. And you've been faced with a, (crosstalk) 

00:28:15
MARGARET Uh hmm. 

00:28:15
EDDIE a very rude awakening that life doesn't go that smoothly. 

00:28:15
MARGARET Uh hmm. 

00:28:15
EDDIE I'm, I'm, I'm hearing that there's some pain behind... (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
MARGARET Yes. 

00:28:20
EDDIE ...that awakening, you know. 

00:28:20
MARGARET  Yes... (crosstalk) 

00:28:25
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:28:25
MARGARET ...and like I said in the sense of pain recognizing that, you know, I can't tell her... (crosstalk) 

00:28:25
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:28:25
MARGARET  that she has to learn that herself. 

00:28:30
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:28:30
EDDIE Sounds like you're al, almost saying, "Nobody was there to rescue me and tell me that," but you're gonna do that for Katie, right now. 

00:28:35
MARGARET  I'd like to... (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:28:40
MARGARET ...but I know I can't, I wish I could. Yes. 

00:28:40
KENT Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:28:40
EDDIE  Is there more of all of that process or that pain where you're feeling that frustration being stuck right now, that, that you could use the group to help you through? 

00:28:50
Dr. Rex Stockton Indiana University 

00:28:50
DR. REX STOCKTON  Eddie's statements helped Margaret move into the deeper issue of the hurt and pain she has felt since the death of her husband. In the next session, you will see a turning point in the group's development. As mentioned earlier, trust issues can be expected to emerge within the group process and leaders need to work to facilitate the resolution of these issues. Note that when members can discuss their fear of disclosure, that this has the paradoxical effect of making them feel safer and more free to go on to, to deeper risk-taking. Let's join the group as they're working with this issue. Be sure to notice how the leaders do a nice job of keeping their discussion and they hear it now. 

00:29:30
Transition Stage: Trust Issues 

00:29:30
DOUG  It's okay, I can do with this and I, I can deal with this. 

00:29:50
KENT Hmm. 

00:29:50
DOUG But you know, people, this is not all my problem. 

00:29:50
KENT  Okay. I, this, and one of the things that's occurring to me as, as you're speaking and, and I wanna check this out with everybody and, and, and that is it seems that it really is difficult to self-disclose and I'm wondering if, if ah, if everybody kinda feels that way that, that there's lots we know about each other but maybe you don't know enough and that would like to know more. 

00:30:15
KATIE  Yeah. 

00:30:20
MARGARET  Yes, that's true but does it have to come with the point we talked about, trust. Shouldn't we trust what we've learned about each other so far? 

00:30:30
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:30:30
MARGARET And once again, we, we're talking about this. 

00:30:35
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:30:35
MARGARET I have to know everything before I'll do anything, so once again... (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
UNKNOWN So. (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
MARGARET ...we're just, it's almost like the way we're living our lives, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:30:40
MARGARET  I have to make sure you're gonna give me the right feedback. 

00:30:45
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. So, you're saying. 

00:30:45
MARGARET Before I say anything. 

00:30:45
EDDIE  How could you say for yourself, Margaret, about what you need to be able to feel more comfortable disclosing in the group? 

00:30:55
MARGARET I guess, well my whole thing has been that in terms of like, you know, I had said before, it's been good for me to realize that everyone else is having problems or trying to make decisions. And I guess I really trust, it isn't a point of not trusting you, I think it's a point of really trusting myself or knowing what do I want to present to the group. Maybe I'm concerned about how you are going to... (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:31:20
MARGARET ...perceive me. 

00:31:20
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:31:20
MARGARET So, I think the problem is with me, it's not with really, you know, with really the group in trusting, it was like trusting myself. 

00:31:30
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:31:30
JAMIE  I think it's just what I would get out of self-disclosing. I mean, I don't wanna just do it just to put something out there. I mean, I feel like a few guys are here, that I'd like to share things with you and I don't know how to work on it that way. 

00:31:50
EDDIE So, what do you need to see or hear from? It looks like you're looking at, uhm, Doug and. 

00:31:55
JAMIE Well, I think I can learn something, I, I've already learned a lot from all of you but I, I really have, there's something with you, Doug, that I, an issue that I'm working on, I really feel like I could or, if I heard, if I heard more about what you are going through, I feel like it would help me out too. And maybe it's selfish but that's just the way I feel like, I feel like you've got something going on that, that is similar to me and uhm, and I'm stuck on this problem and I just thought it might help if we could talk. 

00:32:25
DOUG Uh hmm. 

00:32:25
JAMIE It's not just self-disclosing just to say things, it's to work out with each other. 

00:32:30
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:32:30
JAMIE  So I, I think that there's a lot of, you know 

00:32:35
EDDIE So part of what you're saying is you also need to hear a, a commitment from other people to share. You want to be able to do that yourself but you need to be able to hear it from other people as well. And, and I'm wondering if that might not be something you're all kind of touching on. And again, I'd still like to, to hear from other members... (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:32:55
EDDIE ...about what it, what it takes for you now to feel safer in the group to do some more disclosure. 

00:33:00
KENT  Uh hmm. 

00:33:05
MARGARET It seems like we're all expecting the other person to make the first move. I mean, Jamie, you're saying you had a problem but if you heard someone else, you know, if you heard Doug talk or you'd hear someone else say something that might would help you. So, I, I guess it's like we each have to sort of like trust ourselves or feel that we are strong enough or whatever to lay out what we're feeling about and be able to take the feedback that we get from someone else. We always want if someone else to go out first and be the target... (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:33:35
MARGARET ...before we're willing to do it. That's just the way I've, it seems to me that what... (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:33:40
MARGARET ...we're saying, I guess that I feel that I have to trust myself enough. 

00:33:40
KENT  Jeff, you were gonna say something else for Margaret? 

00:33:45
JEFF  Well, I, I guess it would even take to feel more comfortable disclosing, uhm, I don't know if it really has to do with trust, maybe a little bit, and talked about envy a little bit ago, and uhm, I don't know, I, I just don't, maybe everyone feel this way about. I don't know if I feel enough to be part of the group. 

00:34:10
KENT Hmm. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
JEFF You know, to, to disclose. 

00:34:15
EDDIE  So, somehow feeling different from other members is stopping you from doing even more disclosure? 

00:34:20
JEFF  Uh hmm, have a, I guess I could say something in common with different people in here. And uhm, like on the one hand, kind of being in business, making some business decisions with someone, and I get a feeling like uhm, I don't have options. (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:34:45
JEFF You know, I can relate to Doug and other things I can relate to other people with, like take little bits and pieces, (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:34:55
JEFF you know, when like, like there's something, something big missing. 

00:35:00
KENT Uhm. 

00:35:00
JEFF And what. (crosstalk) 

00:35:00
KENT You have an idea of what that something big might be, that you'd be willing to share with the group? 

00:35:05
JEFF  I don't know, I guess, maybe it's hard for me to, to accept that, uhm, other people in here mi, might each feel as distant as I might, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:35:25
JEFF fear from other people. 

00:35:25
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:35:25
JEFF  Might feel like there's that, that, that bond that's not, not there, at some level. Well, one, this might be, I don't, I don't wanna upset people, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:35:40
JEFF in here. 

00:35:40
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:35:40
JEFF But uhm, I don't know, on, on the one hand I guess, it's a, it's a lot to do with, with me and my education or my lack of education, you know that. (crosstalk) 

00:35:50
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:35:50
JEFF Uhm, having left high school and I think that's kind of something this isn't me, to me apart where everybody else in here, just having, you know, working in the, the shop where I do and kinda like I'm in truck. I mean that work. 

00:36:05
KENT  Uh hmm. 

00:36:10
JEFF And part of that is seen on the envy that I have and maybe I'm, I'm pushing myself away because I feel, maybe a little frustrated, you know, that it... (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:36:20
JEFF ...here we are kind of around in the college community anyway. 

00:36:25
KENT Uh-hmm. 

00:36:25
JEFF And uhm, I feel like I'm the, the only person, you know, without that kind of background. 

00:36:30
KENT Uh huh. 

00:36:30
JEFF  You know, and then, when, when I disclose, you know, what's it gonna be like? 

00:36:35
KENT Uh-huh. It's gonna make you feel even what more? 

00:36:40
JEFF Inferior. Uh hmm. 

00:36:45
EDDIE I've been wondering what it's been like for you to even share this much right now with the rest of the group? 

00:36:50
JEFF Well, I guess, it is ah, mixed. 

00:36:55
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:36:55
JEFF I feel good in one way. I almost feel re-vulnerable in a, (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:37:00
JEFF in another way. 

00:37:00
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:37:00
JEFF Like everybody sees me now. 

00:37:00
KENT Yeah. 

00:37:00
JEFF And so, that, that's, that's a little uncomfortable... (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:37:05
JEFF ...but, but overall if feel, I feel a lot better. 

00:37:10
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:37:10
EDDIE I see you having taken a, a tremendous risk and, (crosstalk) 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:37:15
EDDIE and take, showing a lot of courage to go ahead and disclose that, like you said you're feeling vulnerable, you have been the center of attention. 

00:37:20
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:37:20
EDDIE And for someone who was feeling as distant as you say you were, I'm sure that was really difficult. It, it also sounds to me like this was what I was hearing from each and everyone of you that this is what you want to be doing more of yourself as well as wanting to see from other members. So, again, you took the initiative and, and did very much, I think, of what other people were asking for. 

00:37:40
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:37:40
EDDIE  And that's probably gonna leave you with even more mixed feelings. 

00:37:45
JEFF (laughs) Yeah. 

00:37:50
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:37:50
EDDIE Would you like some feedback from other members in the group? 

00:37:55
JEFF Uh hmm. 

00:37:55
EDDIE Who, who might you feel most comfortable hearing from with, the right person? 

00:38:00
JEFF  Uhm, Jamie. 

00:38:05
KENT  Uh hmm. 

00:38:10
JAMIE Yeah. I, when you were saying that I, I just, when I think of you Jeff, I just the thought. (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
DR. REX STOCKTON It won't surprise you to know that what followed was an outpouring of positive feedback for Jeff. The work the leaders did to help the members disclose from a deeper level produced very positive results. Thus, the leaders felt more positive during this supervision than in the session you saw earlier in this tape. Let's take a look at a brief segment from a supervision that followed. 

00:38:35
Transition Stage: Supervision 

00:38:35
DR. REX STOCKTON  Well, this should have been a little more fun experience. 

00:38:50
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:38:50
KENT (laughs) Yeah, is a, definitely was ah, much different ah, group. 

00:38:55
DR. REX STOCKTON  Uh hmm. 

00:39:00
KENT Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:39:00
DR. REX STOCKTON Looks to me like you started out continuing in transitioning and maybe you've... (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:39:05
DR. REX STOCKTON ...started to move towards the working stage a little bit. (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
KENT Uh hmm, yeah. 

00:39:05
EDDIE It felt a little draining, but for a very different reason than last week...(crosstalk) 

00:39:10
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. Uh hmm 

00:39:10
EDDIE ...this was a more energetic kind of draining if you can do sort of thing. (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
DR. REX STOCKTON Sure. You can feel good about it. (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
EDDIE Yeah, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
DR. REX STOCKTON You'll feel very energized. (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
KENT Uh hmm. That was great and, and then I think it was, we, we've moved more into working because Jeff came across ah, and wanted to share with the group. And ah, ah, I thought we did a really good job of ah, making him feel safe enough to do that and share some really significant, (crosstalk) 

00:39:30
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:39:30
KENT  ah, material with the group. And then get a lot of really neat feedback which... (crosstalk) 

00:39:35
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:39:35
KENT ...then helped him feel good about what he shared. (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:39:40
EDDIE And it seemed real genuine feedback and I, (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
EDDIE I, I was a little concerned at first that he would think, "Oh, I'm just hearing this because... (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
EDDIE ...that's what, what I need to hear," but the members did seem to be sharing that very genuinely and he seemed accepting over the, (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:39:55
EDDIE he seemed to be ready to hear it and... (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
KENT Right. 

00:39:55
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
KENT Yeah. 

00:39:55
EDDIE ...that felt good to me to watch that too. 

00:39:55
KENT Yeah, that... (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
DR. REX STOCKTON Uh hmm. 

00:39:55
KENT ...was great. The whole idea about how taking risk is, is the, is what needs to happen for people to feel closer together and feel safe and, and uhm, and so that did, in fact, happen. 

00:40:10
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:40:10
KENT So. 

00:40:10
EDDIE It's a real different kinda risk-taking than what Katie was doing last week. 

00:40:10
DR. REX STOCKTON You may find that once one member has taken a little risk and gotten rewarded by it, other people can see that it's okay... (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
KENT Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
DR. REX STOCKTON ...and that some usual things happen from that, that it really does start, it gets contagious. It really does start a ripple effect... (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:40:30
DR. REX STOCKTON ...and you'll have some more. We'll see what happens. But it looks to me like you're on the right track with that. (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
KENT Uh-huh, yeah. 

00:40:35
DR. REX STOCKTON The resiliency of the group process has prevailed once again. The leaders have helped the members work through the distrustfulness that is typical in the transition stage. There is now a sense of cohesiveness reflected in the deeper level of disclosures. Here's a short segment from the next session. Jamie has been discussing how she has bypassed her needs in order to attend to the needs of husband and children. Let's join the group as Eddie brings Jamie's problems into the here and now. By the way, remember our resistant Katie from earlier in the tape? Through the group's feedback and her own reflection, she's been able to lower her defensiveness and so that she can see the real issue she needs to face. 

00:41:15
Moving Through Transition to the Working Stage 

00:41:15
JAMIE  I guess that I'm more than just a caretaker. I mean, I uhm, I think a lot of my time in group I've spent trying to develop my own space, you know, in dealing with all of you. It's trying to have my own space in here and not just being part of the mass, (crosstalk) 

00:41:50
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:41:50
JAMIE part of it, you know, it was something that was mine so that you guys could get to know me as Jamie, and not this conglomerative wife, mother, with da-da-da, you know. So, I guess a lot of the ways I was re reigning to, just trying to carve out a place for myself. 

00:42:05
EDDIE  My sense is maybe you're not sure how, how others see you in here in the group. 

00:42:15
JAMIE That's pretty much why I'm out with it. I, I guess I, I really don't know how people, how people view me. Would, would it just be me, and not my husband and my child or my extended family or I, I haven't had much opportunity, in accepting this group. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:42:35
UNKNOWN So you'd be interested in how people might perceive you. 

00:42:40
JAMIE Yeah. Yeah, I think I would. 

00:42:40
KATIE Well, since I don't see your husband and your extended family or your daughter or any of that, all I know is the person that's in here, you know, and she's one person. And I like her a lot. 

00:42:55
JAMIE  Thanks. 

00:43:00
[sil] 

00:43:00
MARGARET  I am when you were talking of, couldn't help but sit or, sit or maybe smile, although, because I thought about you were talking about the part of yourself and it's like, that's part of the reason why I am here because for so long I was someone's wife, I was someone's mother. And I really didn't get to know who Margaret was or is. And so part of my thing now is trying to find out or try to discover Margaret. So, I, I've not seen your, I, I don't know your, your husband or your, you know, your daughter or anything but it was like when the other week or a couple weeks ago when you were out because your daughter was ill, I could, I could relate to that because, you know, once again, having children and knowing that I, too, would have been at home as opposed to be in a group, so I can understand where you, you know, where you're at. And, ah, I think it is a struggle to find thyself, to find yourself and to hold on to it without feeling guilty. 

00:44:00
JAMIE And I just realized that if, if I can't, if I don't kinda attend to my own needs, sooner or later I'm not gonna be here for anybody else anyway. You know, it's like, I started thinking of myself as like this plant that never got watered, or so I watered, I watered once a month and I thought well, you know, and I just, I, I just began to realize that if I don't start taking care of myself and what I want and needed, I'm not, I'm not going be there for my family any longer, I know, or something like that. 

00:44:40
[sil.] 

00:44:40
KATIE  You know, Jamie, your metaphor about being a plant that wasn't watered too much, I think mine's the same too. I'm a plant that's been watered too much, and that ties into misrepresentation. A lot of I want for the perfect career choice isn't mine. It's my mother's. And, yeah, I've been watered way too much, pushed to be the big plant, as big and full and powerful as it can be, you know. And yeah, when I said I want to do the best thing, it wasn't for me. It's because I want to make her proud, too. 

00:45:15
EDDIE  I'm ah, really pleased with the amount of sharing that I'm hearing tonight and, and a lot of attention to one another as well to, to ourselves, I think. Ah, I'm really hearing a theme, I think of, of being able where what we've done in group and outside the group has been a way of presenting ourselves in a way to be accepted. (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
KENT Hmm. 

00:45:40
EDDIE But somehow to each one of us, it's important to feel somehow accepted or appreciated by one another. 

00:45:45
DR. REX STOCKTON  Now we have a working group. The earlier tentative phase has evolved into the interactive process characteristic of the working stage. The members have become more comfortable and feel safer with each other, and are thus able to do more risk taking. When this happens one disclosure usually leads to another. In this tape, we've seen a good deal of interpersonal and intrapersonal development by both the members and leaders. In our final tape, we'll take a closer look at the characteristics of the working stage and then focus on important process of ending the group.
