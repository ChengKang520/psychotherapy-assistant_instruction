BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
NARRATOR Few situations are as challenging for a therapist who has been confronted by a suicidal patient. 

00:00:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Because the one thing you reminded to start listening on now. You should like those, because we have to start working on what sense you are to be suicidal. 

00:00:20
NARRATOR The threat of self-destruction is only one of many extreme behaviors associated with perhaps the most perplexing of all psychological conditions, borderline personality disorder. 

00:00:35
Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder The Dialectical Approach with Marsha M. Linehan, PhD 

00:00:45
NARRATOR How prevalent is borderline personality disorder. One in four psychiatric in-patients meet criteria. These patients experience intense emotional pain that is overwhelming and often incapacitating. In turn, therapists unable to effectively reduce that pain, may also be overwhelmed by their own emotions and respond inappropriately to these patients, becoming either too distant or too close which only exacerbates the problem. 

00:01:10
MARSHA M. LINEHAN It’s one of the worst things about treating borderlines is that it's very easily not to get along with them, because they make you so mad. They have to deal with the reality that you have good reason to be furious at them so you fell completely justified on the one hand and you can panic on the other hand, because they might kill themselves when you are not getting along. And so, you somehow have to bring these two things together to be somewhat reasonable on how you approach things. So that’s when you call a… 

00:01:35
NARRATOR Marsha Linehan is Professor of Psychology and Director of the Suicidal Behaviors Clinic at the University of Washington in Seattle. Dr. Linehan has been researching the complex nature of borderline personality disorder for more than 20 years. Trying to understand why these patients have such difficulty overcoming their impulsive and self-destructive behaviors. 

00:02:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN , PhD Professor of Psychology University of Washington The people who meet criteria for borderline are people who often are very difficulty to trade. Um… Both because we don’t have treatments that are effective and because people who meet their criteria are just inherently difficult to treat. 

00:02:20
Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Dialectical Behavior Therapy 

00:02:20
NARRATOR Recently Dr. Linehan published a book based on her findings. The book presents a treatment model for borderline personality disorder that is based on cognitive-behavioral therapy. But Dr. Linehan has added to that model, creating a treatment approach she calls Dialectical Behavior Therapy or DBT. Data from her clinical studies indicate that DBT is effective in the treatment of these patients. Outcome that has generated a great deal of interest from the therapeutic community. 

00:02:50
MARSHA M. LINEHAN I’m very happy to be here and thank you for inviting me. I’m gonna talk about ah… some research that I’ve been doing, ah… some of you have perhaps read about it or seen some of the data and I’m gonna present sort of… 

00:03:05
NARRATOR As a result of her success treating borderline patients, Dr. Linehan is often asked to speak about her work to professional and patient groups, such as this Psychiatry Grand Rounds in New York. 

00:03:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN And lot of people now think of me primarily as a researcher in borderline personality disorder, I must tell you I think of myself, my kind of self-identity is not that, my self-identity actually is a person who studies and treats and is interested in suicidal behavior. And… 

00:03:30
NARRATOR Although her initial research focused on women with the history of suicide attempts, Dr. Linehan and others are studying the effects of DBT on other behaviors such as substance abuse and eating disorders. 

00:03:45
What is Borderline Personality Disorder? A Theory of Etiology Self-Destructive Behavior Dialectical Behavior Therapy 

00:03:45
NARRATOR This program will cover four primary areas, including the nature of the disorder, factors that may give rise to it, why these patients resort to self-destructive behaviors and an introduction to dialectical behavior therapy. Then at the conclusion of the program, Dr. Linehan and Dr. Alan Francis, Chairman the DSM-IV Task Force, will discuss issues and concerns therapists have about treating these patients. 

00:04:15
What is Borderline Personality Disorder ? 

00:04:20
MARSHA M. LINEHAN The basic problem with the term borderline is that the meaning isn’t very clear to anybody. And the meaning originally came out of theoretical position on people who have this disorder. And so, the term has a lot of meaning and a particular theoretical approach. 

00:04:40
Neurosis Psychosis Borderline Personality Disorder 

00:04:40
NARRATOR The term borderline personality disorder actually has its roots in psychodynamic theory. These patients were thought to be some where between neurosis and psychosis, on the borderline so to speak between these two mental states. To illustrate Dr. Linehan’s approach, actual patient interviews will be used. However, to maintain confidentiality the images has been electronically altered. 

00:05:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So tell me, what do you want out of therapy with me? And what… What are you doing here? 

00:05:10
I want to get better. 

00:05:10
MARSHA M. LINEHAN What’s wrong with you? 

00:05:15
I am a mess. 

00:05:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN How so? 

00:05:15
Um… I don’t know, I just can’t even cope with everyday life right now. 

00:05:20
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So… So what does that mean exactly? 

00:05:25
Um… Well I don’t know how to handle money and I don’t know how to handle relationships, and I don’t know how to handle myself. 

00:05:30
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So from your perspective the problem is that you don’t know how to do things? 

00:05:35
Hmm… I’m sick of this stuff. I really am, you know and I… I am backed up against a wall. Either I need to do this or I need to die. 

00:05:45
NARRATOR I am a mess. I can’t cope with my life. I don’t know hot to handle relationships. I need to die. Complaints typically heard from patients that meet standard criteria used to define borderline personality disorder, such as those found in the DSM-IV. However in developing her model, Dr. Linehan has rearranged the nine DSM-IV categories into five that she finds more clinically useful. These are emotional dysregulation characterized by emotional responses that are highly reactive along with episodes of depression, anxiety, irritability and anger. Interpersonal dysregulation including fears of abandonment and relationships that are chaotic, intense and difficult. Behavioral dysregulation marked by extreme and problematic impulsivity such as profligate spending sprees, indiscriminate sexual conduct, reckless driving, binge eating, self-mutilation and suicide attempts. Cognitive dysfunction including brief non-psychiatric de-personalization, delusion and dissociation. And dysregulation of the self with complaints of feelings of emptiness and problems with self-identity. Dr. Linehan’s research on DBT is an ongoing process. Therefore, therapy sessions are always monitored to observe the behavior of the therapist and ensure adherence to the treatment manual. The range and complexity of these beliefs and behaviors may be a contributing factor to the negative image associated with this patient population. 

00:07:30
MARSHA M. LINEHAN A lot of people can't stand people who meet that criteria. There is a lot of prejudice towards people who meet that criteria. And so before you ever show up wherever you're going, if people think you meet criteria for they already unlike you before you get there. The question is whether you are saying now that you refuse to keep the agreement, because we have this battle all the time. So that’s the main reason patients don’t like it, because they know that there is a lot of prejudice, and they’re right about that, there is lot of prejudice. Ah… And mental health professionals often don’t wanna work with people who meet criteria, refused to work with people who meet criteria, etc. 

00:08:05
NARRATOR However, Dr. Linehan believes that those attitudes can be overcome through a clear understanding of the factors that give rise to this troubling disorder. 

00:08:20
A Theory Of Etiology 

00:08:25
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So that will start in… 

00:08:30
NARRATOR In Dr. Linehan’s dialectical approach there ae two important elements that appear to be involved in the development of borderline personality disorder. One, biological and the other, environmental. 

00:08:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN What I believe is that borderline personality disorder as it's core is a disorder of the emotion regulation system. What it is, is an emotion regulation dysfunction. Now, it’s important to recognize what I mean by that. 

00:08:55
NARRATOR According to Dr. Linehan’s theory, this emotional regulation dysfunction comes about as a result of a combination of emotional vulnerability that is overly sensitive responses on the part of the patient and an inability to modulate the resulting emotions. 

00:09:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN In a sense, I think if it is a temperament disorder, which is you’ve got an individual who comes in with difficulty regulating, especially negative affect and possible positive. The fact that I’m saying is biological, doesn’t mean I think is genetic, there is not actually the data is not overwhelming that there is a genetic link although there is a little bit. But it could be enter you to in factors which certainly can have an affect on later functioning, and it could be some sort of trauma especially head trauma at an early stage in life. Okay, so I think there are lot of ways to get biological dysfunction. And I believe that there is a biological dysfunction and so what you’ve got is this group of people who, if you, you read the developmental literature or like the slow to mub(ph) child or the inhabited child that are the um… difficult child and that the developmental people talk about, okay. So it's this child whose cranking can't regulate affect well, okay, especially negative they can't regulate. Now, that would answer the whole question if one for the fact that if all those people were borderline we would be overrun with them, okay. So can’t be if that’s all the areas, okay. There is got to be… 

00:10:25
NARRATOR In addition to this biological predisposition, Dr. Linehan believes certain environmental factors are also involved. 

00:10:30
MARSHA M. LINEHAN What kind of environment is the environment that doesn’t fit with ah… difficult temperament or inhabited temperament or a temperament with the individual has trouble regulation? The theory is, is that the key environmental characteristics, what I call the invalidating environment. 

00:10:50
NARRATOR The defining element in an invalidating environment is that it pervasively communicates to the individual that his/her private responses to events are invalid, inappropriate or incorrect. 

00:11:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN In an invalidating environment all problems refute is motivational problems that if you just try hard enough, want to do it, you can pull yourselves by the bootstraps. It's kind of the pure cognitive therapy environment, you know if you just think straight you feel better, if you weren't distraught, you’d be okay, etc. Our whole culture largely has this and some families more than others. Primary reason, you don’t learn how effectively regulate emotions in an invalidating environment is because the failure and the difficulty in regulating is never taken seriously. 

00:11:35
NARRATOR The need for validation has particular importance for these patients. A majority report incidents of sexual abuse in childhood, a typical invalidating experience that is often dismissed by others. As a result, the patients do not learn to trust their own responses to events, and search the environment for clues as to how to think and feel. 

00:11:55
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Now, this happens consistently and constantly with people with emotion regulation disorder. What happens all the time is other people say, calm down, quit distraughting, you look exaggerating, could being so upset. I mean, what is last time you said that, even I who have this theory say that kind of stuff. I mean, you know I think that we all do it because it’s so pervasive in our culture, which is fine if you can do it. I mean, I don’t have any problem with this sort of culture except that is not good for this sort of person. 

00:12:30
NARRATOR The point is that the interplay of emotional dysfunction and an invalidating environment results in an emotional instability, which in turn leads to the interpersonal, behavioral, cognitive and self-dysregulations that characterize borderline personality disorder. 

00:12:50
Self Destructive Behavior 

00:13:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN I’d like for you to think of some situations in your own lives that we can practice with… 

00:13:10
NARRATOR This group of patients and family members are learning how to improve the quality of their interpersonal interactions. 

00:13:15
KIM I understand that umm… maybe you're… you're interested in, in my well being and I really do appreciate it. Umm… But I really feel overwhelmed… 

00:13:25
NARRATOR This role playing exercise puts Kim a former patient, in precisely the kind of situation which in the past would lead to an emotional crisis. Only now, she has learned how to respond in an effective rather than in an extremely ineffective way. 

00:13:45
KIM I think the biggest thing that it's helped me with is this whole idea of ah… feeling one thing and just feeling like I have to act on it, and knowing that somehow I can feel this way and act differently. Those are things I could never do before, and every time I would get into situations where I'd either have to say no or make a request, I would freak out because of the emotional state or, or ah… because I would just be so angry at myself or thinking I could say no or for thinking that I could ask for something. And umm… I really found that it's particularly helpful in me organizing my thoughts, but also in me feeling okay about myself, whether or not I get what I want. 

00:14:30
NARRATOR Kim has learned that she can respond to emotional situations without resorting to extreme behaviors. But the question remains, why do these patients go to such extremes, even to the point of killing themselves in response to emotional crisis? 

00:14:50
MARSHA M. LINEHAN The function of borderline behaviors are to regulate affect or their direct consequence of dysregulated affect, so effective um… that it’s almost impossible to get the behavior stopped. I mean, the problem was stopping suicidal behaviors, is they're almost made in heaven for affect regulation. First of all of course, almost every one thinks if you are dead that you feel better. Okay, so if you talk to borderlines you want to be dead, inevitably they will tell you something a long live that they’re actually gonna to fell better. Okay, either they won’t be hurt so they won’t feel anymore, it's kind of like associating in sort of an extreme way. Or they are going to heaven or something, are they're seeing their relatives or something like that. Now, I have not seen in the New York times yet, so I don’t know if that’s true or not how it really happens. And in fact, you just heard the beginning of the therapy for that, okay the first and major thing we do is shake up a belief that things will be better if you’re dead. 

00:15:50
I mean, I don’t think I really want to kill myself, but I don’t see anything any better than it was the day I tried to kill myself. 

00:15:55
MARSHA M. LINEHAN I mean, trying to kill yourself just sort of, off hand, doesn’t usually solve problems. 

00:16:00
I just think that I feel like I have to, you know. It's not, I don’t think it's really even a moody thing, I just think it's when I feel like, there is no other choice, I just say well you know there is no other choice so do it, you know. 

00:16:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Okay, so back to what you want out of therapy. Now one of my goals, that we need to get agreement on, is kind of independent of what your mood is, that you won’t try to kill yourself again. Now the question is, whether you agree to that? 

00:16:35
I agree to that. 

00:16:35
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Okay, now how does it work. Overdosing is marvelous for affect regulation. I mean, all of us upset, you know I fell better tomorrow, let me get some sleep. A good overdose, a really one that works well, puts you to sleep and most people feel better after some period of time sleeping with some sort of drugs. Cutting and burning are very effective but no one actually understands why. I mean, there are lot of sort of biological theories and the behaviors of course say no it's probably this but nonetheless, no one has really got the data goods on that. We don’t really know why it works, but everybody who works with these people know that you get a person especially with anxiety and anger is best on those two emotions, I think. But a little cutting and a person feels lot better, and you hear this repeatedly and I think everybody agrees that the phenomena occurs, we just don’t know why it occurs. Now, the next way that it works you might not have thought of, but if you understood emotion modulation and there’s actually, now a lot of work, there is some research on emotion modulation and what humans do to modulate emotion. It turns out that one of the main things that humans do and one of the things in fact you have to be able to do to modulate emotions, you got to be able to control the tension. And if you cannot control the tension, you cannot control emotion, because distraction or focusing on something else is a very effective affect regulation strategies that turns out. And many borderline patients often cannot control emotion. So it, it turns you out there regulating affect, requires the ability to regulate attention among many other things, but that’s one of the things you've to go to do. Now lets think about jumping from high buildings, trying to drown and a few of those things. You have to agree that they focus the mind. Okay, they definitely have that affect. So they regulate affect often by focusing on to something else which then becomes a major thing sometimes especially that happens on in-patient you know, it can really take up everyone’s time and attention away from whatever this other was. And parasuicidal behavior also often regulates the environment and the environment is often the source of the negative affect. In first place where the precipitant of itself, you know we all know that lovers come back, husbands come back, people put you in hospitals and see how we've actually got in some hospitals to put you out, if you do that kind of stuff, etc. So, the environment changes, so it's, it's very functional behavior, very effective behavior, it only has one drawback which has got long term negative side effects. And if it wasn’t for that, one could be in favor of it, but… But the recognition of how effective it is, is what alerts you to the trouble you've got trying to stop it, which is why it's extraordinarily difficult. 

00:19:35
Dialectical Behavior Therapy 

00:19:45
NARRATOR Dr. Linehan comes from a cognitive behavioral background. In formulating her approach to understanding borderline personality disorder, she built upon the precepts of the existing theory. For example, standard cognitive-behavioral therapy is a technology of change that is changing behavior through learning and experience. Dialectical behavior therapy goes a step further in emphasizing the patients fully accept themselves, their emotional status and their environment, as they are, an approach that Dr. Linehan defines as radical acceptance. 

00:20:25
MARSHA M. LINEHAN You’re gonna see why I moved away from what I think of a standard behavior therapy. I realized that I will hear to somehow blend into the treatment acceptance, not only acceptance of the individual, but acceptance at a radical level, in other words true acceptance. Not as many of the people you know acceptance big word now, you may not know that, in psychiatry may not but in psychology it is. But many of the acceptance people are sort of acceptance for change, in other words they are not really into acceptance, they are into acceptance is the strategy to get you to change. And so it's really change oriented, but I started thinking maybe we really need radical acceptance, true acceptance. So I started looking around for, who knows anything about that. And it's very interesting you'd think western psychology and psychiatry would have it but they actually don’t, they mostly have this acceptance in order to change stuff and, and especially roching(ph) which is sort of the grandparent of acceptance. There acceptance is that you have the potential to be somebody but you’re not yet, okay. But I knew that it wasn’t gonna work out well to try to send that particular message. So I figured I needed something, and what I finally did was I went to eastern psychologies and I went over to Buddhist Psychology, it's in practice. And I essentially ultimately dropped the Buddhist part of it, kept the Zen part of it and tried to learn because those are the people, spiritual people in general are the ones who talk acceptance a lot. So I figured maybe they knew something about it, and so I went and actually started and still do. And that's where I ended up picking up most of the acceptance, the radical acceptance strategies that I then brought back in and put together with the behavior therapy. But I knew especially not in the early 80's, I couldn’t go around saying I was doing Zen behavior therapy. This was not gonna work out professionally. And so I figured I need something else and so I needed a theory that could put the two together and get one or get it from two to one. And that’s when I found dialectics, dialectical philosophy. I went to that and I brought that together and brought that in and that's the house that the whole therapy sits inside of so to speak. It's the philosophical frame and then it's turned out all by itself to be a driving factor in the development of the treatment and the key thing to know about this is, this is that dialectics, the whole focus is on the resolution of polarity and tension and the movement towards synthesis. 

00:22:55
NARRATOR Dialectics is a process of change, an idea or thesis generates and is transformed into its opposite or antithesis. The tension between these opposites gives rise to a reconciliation or synthesis. In borderline personality disorder, the patient get stuck between extremes, unable to move towards synthesis. Dialectical behavior therapy emphasizes that patients accept themselves and at the same time make attempts to change. 

00:23:30
MARSHA M. LINEHAN We’ve got to figure out a way to tolerate bad things without harming yourself. So let’s figure out all the things you tried. Then we have to figure out some other things, since those didn’t work. 

00:23:50
Tried talking it out with people. 

00:23:50
MARSHA M. LINEHAN And what happened? 

00:23:50
Failed. 

00:23:50
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Okay. Did you ever try radical acceptance? 

00:23:55
What’s that? 

00:23:55
MARSHA M. LINEHAN You just give yourself up, sort of, to the situation. You just accept the ain’t gonna happen and you’re going to have to cope with it some other way. Because all of us run into boulders on the path. And life is like walking on a path, you know. We all run into boulders. And it can’t be that nothing else can help. There’s got to be more than one way to get everywhere. Those of you work with borderlines know that there is a lot of polarities. There’s a lot of what the analysts call splitting. I don’t use that term, but a lot of tensions and extremes on both sides. And it not only goes on, not only do the patients do it but I’ve come to realize that the therapists do it also, and both of them tend to often get into black and white rather extreme, often inflexible, reasonably rigid sorts of behavior patterns. Umm… And that, dialectics is really geared to dealing with that, and it's the balance of acceptance that change this come to define the therapy and is the reason for moving away from standard behavior therapy, it’s this acceptance and balance. 

00:25:05
NARRATOR Balance is the hallmark concept in dialectical behavior therapy. For example, support of acceptance is balanced with confrontation and change strategies. 

00:25:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So I think it, it’s not actually pain that’s the problem. But it ends up focusing as if it were the pain, when it’s not the pain. It’s the sense of being invalidated, and the sense of not being cared about. That’s my guess. What do you think? 

00:25:30
Un…huh… 

00:25:30
MARSHA M. LINEHAN But the problem that we have to solve, is how be in a situation that you feel is unjust without having to harm yourself to solve it. You open to that? 

00:25:40
Yeah. 

00:25:45
NARRATOR In addition, active problem solving is balanced by a corresponding emphasis on validating the patients current emotional, cognitive and behavioral responses. 

00:25:55
MARSHA M. LINEHAN You see, what I think is happening is that when you’re in a lot of pain, and you feel either not cared about or not taken seriously invalidated that’s what sets you up to hurt yourself, and also want to die. And that what we need to do is figure out a solution to that problem, so that there are other ways to get out besides hurting yourself or trying to kill yourself. 

00:26:20
NARRATOR And stylistically, DBT balances a straightforward somewhat irreverent attitude on the part of the therapist with warmth, flexibility and responsiveness to the patient. 

00:26:35
You know it’s really had for me, I have been going through this since I was 11 years old… 

00:26:35
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Hmm… 

00:26:40
I’m stick to this shit. Either I need to do this or I need to die… 

00:26:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Un… huh… 

00:26:40
Those are my two choices. 

00:26:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Well, why not die? 

00:26:45
Well, if it comes down to it, I will. 

00:26:45
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Un… huh… But why not now? 

00:26:50
Because this is my last hope. Because if I’ve got one last hope left why not take it? 

00:26:55
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So in other words, all things being equal, you’d rather live than die. If you can pull this off? 

00:27:00
If I can pull it off, yeah. 

00:27:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Okay, that good though, so that’s going to be your strength. We’re going to play to that. 

00:27:05
NARRATOR Patients with borderline personality disorder present a significant challenge to therapists. 

00:27:10
Are you feeling like coming yourself right this manner? 

00:27:15
NARRATOR In addition, this complex and confusing disorder has significant impact on family members as well. But looking at the troublesome beliefs and behaviors associated with borderline personality disorder from a dialectical perspective may help to raise the level of understanding about this seemingly and tractable disorder. And in the process improve the lives of these patients. 

00:27:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Many of the patients that we see have life time histories were the miserableness of their lives. You know the desperation of their lives is only paid attention to when it's accompanied by being suicidal. In other words, many of the patients have experiences where they only get attended to if they say they’re going to kill themselves. I’m trying to change the pattern and I’m trying to teach the patient that they can be attended to without having to get suicidal. I’m telling you something. Listen to me. If you don’t kill yourself you’re going to make it, you’re going to get out of hell. You’re going to get out of here, it’s not always going to be so bad. Life is not always going to be so painful, and you’re not going to hurt so bad. You’re going to get to be a more normal person who has a life that’s worth living. That’s going to happen to you if you don’t kill yourself. You worked too hard, and you’re too bright and you’re too capable not to get there. You’re going to get out, you just have to keep yourself alive. 

00:28:40
ALLEN FRANCES M.D. Duke University Marsha, how do you get started in working with um… one of theses people? 

00:28:45
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Well, umm… from my point of view, one of the most important things to do is to structure the treatment. And so what umm… what I’ve done and thinking about treatment is divided or looked at treatment in terms of phases. So I think there is a phase one, a phase two and so on. And the first phase is what I call ah… the pretreatment phase and that’s the phase that some other people call the contracting phase. But during the pretreatment phase, that’s where you’ve got to um… do your assessment and make sure the person actually meets criteria for the ah… treatments that you’re doing or find out what they meet criteria for. So, I recommend to everyone that you with all patients even if you don’t think that they meet the criteria for borderline personality disorder, that you assess for borderline personality disorder. Even if you don’t asses for much else in a structured way, because many individuals who ultimately do meet criteria for the disorder don’t appear like they meet criteria for the disorder. And in fact maybe functioning in a much better level then they were subsequently. 

00:29:50
ALLEN FRANCES Okay, how do you form the treatment alliance? 

00:29:50
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Everything about therapy forms a treatment alliance if the suicidal behavior, I always focus on that first. 

00:30:00
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:30:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN If you’ve been kicked out by therapists and no one likes you and no one wants to work with you and you’re not suicidal, that will be second or that would jump to first. And so I begin with by saying first of all… 

00:30:10
ALLEN FRANCES The most emergent behavior first, but then therapy defeating behavior is second? 

00:30:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN No, suicidal behavior and life threatening behaviors first… 

00:30:15
ALLEN FRANCES First, okay. 

00:30:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Okay. So, included there is suicide crisis, threatening to kill yourself… 

00:30:20
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:30:20
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …trying to kill yourself… 

00:30:25
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:30:25
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …and any behavior that where there is intentional self-entry… 

00:30:25
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:30:30
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …and the reason that’s important to do first, because lot of people argue with me on and they say, no you should skip that. But the reason… For example, we'll say, listen I do with cutting first. A lot of therapists say that and patients almost always say that. And the reason I never say that is because I think that if a person intentionally tries to harm themselves, that’s the exact opposite of the goal of therapy. That’s the most incompatible behavior with therapy that I can think of. 

00:30:55
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:31:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN And so as a therapist it seems to me, I couldn't possibly not target that first. So, what I say to the person at the beginning of therapy, first we find out about those behaviors, and you need to get that from referral or you knew about it from whoever called you or the patient tells you any… any of the above. And then what I say to them, I say; listen, the question is do you wanna stop that behavior, would that be a goal? 

00:31:20
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:31:20
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Are you willing to agree that that would be a goal of therapy? And if they don’t want to stop it right this minute, I sort of layoff and I just suggest that at least would that be the goal, is that we'll work towards together, you want to agree to that? Sometimes… 

00:31:30
ALLEN FRANCES If I say; No, I feel too bad, I don’t wanna be bothered with anything. 

00:31:35
MARSHA M. LINEHAN You don’t wanna be in therapy at all? 

00:31:40
ALLEN FRANCES No. 

00:31:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Okay, if you don’t wanna be… 

00:31:40
ALLEN FRANCES I’m forced here. 

00:31:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN You’ve been forced here? 

00:31:40
ALLEN FRANCES The cop brought me here and I really don't wanna be here. 

00:31:45
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Okay! If that happens, then that's like almost the definition of pretreatment. Because treatment requires this clarity of agreement. 

00:31:55
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:31:55
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So then, all of therapy focus, I do nothing except discuss with you the pros and cons of the current life… 

00:32:00
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:32:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …which I usually point out is the life of chronic. And… And I point out, you know you can be a chronic all your life, that’s fine or you could be in therapy not be a chronic. 

00:32:10
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:32:10
MARSHA M. LINEHAN And getting that initial agreement to therapy… 

00:32:15
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:32:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …is the first task, and I really, I don’t do anything else. The average person who comes in can see that this particular way of running a life is not working. 

00:32:20
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:32:20
MARSHA M. LINEHAN So then you’ll have to say is, is then you have to choose between this life that's not working or some other possible life. And that’s the whole focus and that’s all we really do in therapy. 

00:32:30
ALLEN FRANCES If a person keep saying things like the reason it's not working is because she’s done that to me or he has done that to me… 

00:32:35
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Yeah. 

00:32:40
ALLEN FRANCES …or I had a terrible early life… 

00:32:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Un…huh… 

00:32:40
ALLEN FRANCES …and I kick it over it. 

00:32:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Yeah. 

00:32:40
ALLEN FRANCES How do you get them to see it as something they can change? 

00:32:45
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Well, it’s a good… I mean they only have two options this what I would say to them, and there are only two options, you either accept it the way it is and stay with them with the rest of your life or you make an effort to change it, and I can’t guarantee you can change it. 

00:32:55
ALLEN FRANCES We can’t expect the world to change, so that means you're gonna have to? 

00:33:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Well, you could wait around for the world to change, I don’t have any problem with that. 

00:33:05
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:33:05
MARSHA M. LINEHAN You know it just hasn’t changed yet, probably won't change, you could wait for it to change, but on the other hand you could see ah… why you're waiting around for it to change, you could be a little bit happier… 

00:33:15
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:33:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …and is that an option you might consider in, we could work on that. 

00:33:20
ALLEN FRANCES A really important part of establishing this alliance is getting the patients attention. And as you know you are the one most compelling people in the world, the question is can everyone do this or some people better at it than others? And what’s your advice to those people who don’t naturally compel other peoples attention in the way that you do? 

00:33:40
MARSHA M. LINEHAN Well, that is probably on of the most common commerce is made about this treatment, it's people saying, isn’t this just your personality, isn’t this just you? So, it's a reasonable comment except for the following, I have trained a lot of people in doing this treatment now. I've trained a lot of graduate students so that kind of people becoming doctor level, but a lot of case managers and a lot of masters level therapist. And my experience is that it isn’t a personality characteristic that almost anybody can do it, I mean obviously some will be more comfortable. But um… the part of the compelling nature of it is the approach itself… 

00:34:20
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:34:20
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …not the personality style. 

00:34:20
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… You probably worked more than any other therapist in the country with these problems, based on all you’ve done and all you know and all you've lived through and all you’ve experienced, what’s your advice to the rest of us? 

00:34:35
MARSHA M. LINEHAN I think the therapists have to believe in their patients that you have to find the strength… 

00:34:45
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:34:45
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …and the capability… 

00:34:45
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:34:45
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …that’s there, and then you have to amplify it, and that you have to believe that you can do it. And then I think that you have to believe in yourself. 

00:34:55
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:34:55
MARSHA M. LINEHAN And I think you have to find the capability and effectiveness that you have within yourself, which I’m convinced the therapists have. 

00:35:00
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:35:00
MARSHA M. LINEHAN And you’ve got to find that and you’ve got to amplify that and bring that out also and you’ve got to believe in both. And then, when you lose all your faith, which take it from me, everybody does… 

00:35:15
ALLEN FRANCES Un…huh… 

00:35:15
MARSHA M. LINEHAN …you’ve got to have some one who will believe in you, and you gotto talk to them. Then you believe in yourself again, you’re believing the patient again. You lose your faith in the patient, you have gotta a colleague who will, you lose it in yourself, you’ve gotta a colleague who will. But ultimately there’s got to be this circle of believing. And I think that the data show that if you do this and you use the available effective treatments, you can make peoples lives better.
