NARRATOR This videotape is a presentation of Guilford Publications. When a mental health or other professional evaluates an allegation of sexual abuse, the interviews often take place in a clinical setting. However, when these cases go to court, the evaluator must present his or her findings in a very different and unfamiliar setting.

Testifying About Child Sexual Abuse A Courtroom Guide with Kathleen Coulborn Faller, PhD, Suellyn Scarnecchia, JD 

00:00:40
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA Would you please describe what happened during those interviews? 

00:00:40
NARRATOR Interviewing a child who may have been sexually abused is very different from the experience of testifying about that interview in a court of law. Kathleen Coulborn Faller is a professor in the school of social work and Faculty Director of Civitas Child and Family Programs as well as Director of the Family Assessment Clinic at the University of Michigan. Dr. Faller is also a nationally recognized expert in the field of forensic interviewing and has testified in over a 100 court cases. 

00:01:15
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER , PhD Professor, School of Social Work University of Michigan The major difference is this is an adversarial context and there is no way that I can – that you really can understand and appreciate that without having been there where your credentials will be challenged, your procedures will be challenged, your conclusions will be challenged and often your credibility and your good name. Okay? And you have to appreciate that that's what the legal context is like. 

00:01:40
DEMONSTRATION 

00:01:40
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA First, I'm going to ask you to describe your qualifications. Can you tell the jurors, your educational background please? 

00:01:50
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER I have… 

00:01:50
NARRATOR Suellyn Scarnecchia is clinical professor of law at the University of Michigan and supervising attorney in the Law School's Child Advocacy Law Clinic. 

00:02:00
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA , JD Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs University of Michigan I think mental health experts have the same concerns that most experts do at least at the beginning. One, that they're nervous about testifying regardless of how comfortable you are with yourself and how you might be able to for instance, present at a professional conference. It's not the same when you're on the stand serving as a witness; um… being cross examined. There are too many situations in life when you're publicly cross examined. And ah… so, people express fears and um.. and concerns about what that experiences is going to be like. 

00:02:30
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA Dr. Faller, how did you first learn of Cynthia's(ph) case? 

00:02:35
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER Ah… we were called at the clinic by the court and asked if we would be willing to evaluate this case. 

00:02:40
NARRATOR To illustrate the experience of testifying in a sexual abuse case, and what evaluator should know before entering the courtroom. This videotape will discuss preparing for testimony, giving testimony in court, limits on testimony, particularly Hearsay evidence and how children can be prepared to testify.

PREPARING FOR TESTIMONY 

00:03:10
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA Will you please state your name for the record? 

00:03:15
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER Kathleen Coulborn… 

00:03:15
Juvenile Court Family Court Criminal Court Civil Suits 

00:03:15
NARRATOR It is important to understand that there are different courts that maybe involved in a child's sexual abuse case. Juvenile Court deals with child protection issues. Family Court decides custody and visitation rights. Criminal Court is where alleged offenders are prosecuted and Civil Suits where damages maybe filed by either the victim or the accused. It is also important to note that the rules of evidence and other court procedures vary depending on the type of court. For example, in most criminal trials the victim must testify, but the testimony of the forensic evaluator will be quite restricted. In contrast, in child protection hearings, children often do not testify, but forensic evaluators do. According to Dr. Faller, regardless of the legal setting, there is a cardinal rule to keep in mind when testifying in court. 

00:04:05
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER Be prepared, be prepared, be prepared, that is know your case very well. First of all, know what it is you want to… to communicate. But secondly, know the background facts. You have to appreciate that the courtroom in many respects is like a stage and it's the performance that counts. So you can be a great mental health professional and fumble and bumble on the witness stand and you won't persuasive to the jury. 

00:04:35
NARRATOR Preparation includes a thorough familiarity with the basic case information. 

00:04:35
PREPARATION Names of people involved Ages of people involved Chronology of events 

00:04:40
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER What that means is you have to remember the names of the people involved, their ages; I usually try to have in my head the whole chronology of the case, so that I can't be tripped up on cross-examination by somebody who suggest something happened at a time when it didn't happen. And you have to so you have to through(ph) that in your head before you get there. The other way in which I prepare is trying to anticipate the likely questions that I'm going to asked on cross-examination and the possible weakness in the case and have already thought before you get to court about how you're going to respond to that particular question. 

00:05:20
Preparation Anticipate cross examination Anticipate weaknesses in the case Prepare responses in advance 

00:05:25
GIVING TESTIMONY IN COURT 

00:05:30
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA You said that you saw Cynthia(ph) twice. For how long did you see her? 

00:05:30
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER The first time I saw her for about an hour and a half and actually also… 

00:05:35
NARRATOR When mental health and other professionals appear in court, they will find several types of attorneys. Some who will be supportive of their position. 

00:05:45
Objection, Your Honor, the witness is… 

00:05:45
NARRATOR And some who will not. 

00:05:50
JUDGE JONES Objection overruled. Please continue. 

00:05:50
NARRATOR When preparing to testify, it is important to know what the respective roles and responsibilities of each of these are. 

00:05:55
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA Your Honor, she is telling… There is a real different relationship um… between a mental health expert and the attorney who will be taking your testimony versus the attorney who will be cross-examining you. Ah… the attorney who will be taking your testimony, hopefully will prepare you, but sometimes when you're called into testify for instance, in a child protection case you're dealing with a very busy prosecutor who will not take the time to sit down with you necessarily and prepare. I always suggest that witnesses advocate for themselves in this setting and insist on preparation time, at least call the attorney and say just tell me five minutes of what you're going to ask me about. So that you can have some sense of how your testimony will be centered. But, if they well prepare… prepare you or they can't, the most important thing to do is to read your notes and know your information as best you can. Now, once the attorney prepares you, you need to tell them what you're nervous about and what you're concerned about um… and make it explicit, so that the attorney has warned ahead of time of what makes you uncomfortable in terms of your findings and conclusions where your weakness are, this is the time to let all of that come out while you're being prepared to testify. When I do a direct examination of a mental health expert, I'm looking to do a few things. First of all to indicate to the trier of fact who is either the judge or the jury that this is a highly qualified witness. 

00:07:20
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA First, I'm gonna ask you to describe your qualifications. Can you tell the jurors your educational background please? 

00:07:25
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER I have an A.B. from Overland College, I have… did graduate work in political science at the University of Chicago. I have a Master's degree in Social work from the University of Michigan… 

00:07:35
SULLEYN SCARNECCHIA With somebody ah… who has a lot of experience like Dr. Faller, it's easy to do that um… the less experience a witness has, the more I need to work with what is it exactly that qualifies you to do this evaluation and make these conclusions. Witnesses get concern that they don't have the for instance, academic credentials or experience credentials that are needed, but in fact, um… the rule about who can be an expert is very broad. And so, as long as you have enough combination of experience and education you can be qualified as an expert and that that is something that should be prepared ahead of time. So, I'm looking in the direct exam to show that this is an expert who knows what he or she is talking about and you can come to these kinds of conclusions. I'm also looking to set out what the evaluation was like and what kind of steps the witness took to be able to reach their conclusion. So, I'll backup, I won't just ask what are your conclusions, I'll backup and go through the process to show the judge and to lay a foundation for the cross-examination that this was a high quality well done examination. 

00:08:45
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER This had an impact on her and I could tell toward the end of the interview that she was fairly conscious so the fact that she was being videotaped. 

00:08:50
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA Can I interrupt you right there, Dr. Faller and just ask why is it that you audio and videotaped the interviews? 

00:09:00
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER Um… videotape is the most important and that that gives us both a picture and sound of what the sort of what it actually takes place. It means that I am… I have to spend less time taking notes, it also means I have a more complete and accurate record of what took place. The reason I also audiotape is frequently I transcribe the audiotape before I actually write the report and it's easier to transcribe from an audiotape than it is from a video. 

00:09:25
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA Do you also use this videotape in sharing information with other team members? 

00:09:30
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER Yes. 

00:09:35
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA And finally, I'll get to the… to the witnesses conclusions, find out how he or she reach the conclusions and what impact those conclusions will have on the case if any. 

00:09:45
NARRATOR In many child protection and divorce cases an expert would be allowed to express an opinion about sexual abuse. However, in most states this would not be permitted in a criminal case. 

00:09:55
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA Now, based on the documentation you received, um… the information you received from other team members and your own evaluation of this family, do you have an opinion as to whether or not Cynthia(ph) has been sexually abused? 

00:10:10
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER I do, yes. 

00:10:10
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA And what is that opinion? 

00:10:10
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER That she has been sexually abused. 

00:10:15
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA One other thing that we try to do during direct examination is undermine the cross-examination. So, if I spot that there are weaknesses in my witnesses testimony, for instance, he or she cut corners that they shouldn't have cut, I will attempt to bring that out on direct… direct examination and give the witness an opportunity to explain it I opposed to having the witness first try to explain it on cross-examination, where they might be limited to only yes or no responses. 

00:10:40
JUDGE JONES Mr. Zhikai(ph), do you care to cross-examine the witness? 

00:10:45
DENNIS ZHIKAI (ph) Yes, Your Honor. 

00:10:45
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA The other thing to think about in preparing for a cross-examination is to really be clear about what your recommendation is and why, and then really be willing to stick by it. 

00:10:55
DENNIS ZHIKAI (ph) Good morning, Dr. Faller and my name is Dennis Zhikai(ph), I represent the mother, Christine Smith in this case. 

00:11:00
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER Good morning. 

00:11:05
DENNIS ZHIKAI (ph) Dr. Faller, when Cynthia(ph) first came to see you, she was at that time would have with her grandmother? 

00:11:10
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER That's correct. 

00:11:10
DENNIS ZHIKAI (ph) And she was not very pleased with that living situation? 

00:11:15
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER That's correct. 

00:11:15
DENNIS ZHIKAI (ph) And the reasons you're given for that… 

00:11:15
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA You need to show that you're being honest and that you were neutral when you began to evaluate this child. But presumably, your findings and your conclusions have alleged to be less than neutral, you have made some decision about what happened to this child or what didn't happen. And that's our right. That's what you are being asked to do. So it's very important to once you get into the courtroom, feel comfortable about advocating for the position that you've reached without exaggerating your findings and without becoming defensive about your findings. 

00:11:50
DENNIS ZHIKAI (ph) Now, focusing on Cynthia's(ph) more recent statements. You have testified that you believe Cynthia(ph) when she says that her step-father sexually abused her. 

00:12:05
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER Yes. 

00:12:05
DENNIS ZHIKAI (ph) And do you also believe Cynthia's(ph) statements about her friend Tina is sexually abusing her? 

00:12:15
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER No. 

00:12:15
DENNIS ZHIKAI Okay. She has made those statements, hasn't she? 

00:12:15
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER After that she… when she was feeling pressure to vacant, she said that Tina had… 

00:12:25
DENNIS ZHIKAI Excuse me, Dr. Faller, if I could interrupt. Your Honor, Dr. Faller is not being responsive to my question. 

00:12:30
JUDGE JONES Dr. Faller, when Mr. Zhikai ask you a question that calls for yes or no answer. Please answer him stating yes or no. If you feel in your professional opinion that you cannot answer… 

00:12:45
NARRATOR The adversarial atmosphere of the courtroom is a far cry from the comfort of the clinic. The nature of the legal system is often a source of discomfort for expert witnesses. But this merely reflects the different goals of different professions. 

00:12:55
JOHN E. B. MYERS Now, of course, when it comes to expert testimony in particular, we could divide that testimony into two categories medical and expert testimony provided by mental health professionals. Now, Dr… 

00:13:10
NARRATOR John Myers is professor of law at the McGeorge School of Law at the University of the Pacific. Professor Myers is an expert in legal issues concerning child abuse. 

00:13:25
JOHN E. B. MYERS , JD Professor of Law, McGeorge School of Law University of the Pacific The ultimate goal of any litigation whether it's a civil case or a criminal case is to discover the truth. The way the legal system goes about discovering the truth is through the advisory process of presenting evidence and cross-examining critiquing, looking at that evidence under a microscope to make sure that it is reliable and then proceeding on after all the evidence is gathered to try and figure out what the truth is. The truth is designed to emerge from a clash of advisories ah… in which one side present its version of the truth and the other side presents it's version of the truth and that's the way the system is supposed to operate. This is rather different mode of proceeding and mental health professionals are accustom to. 

00:14:05
DENNIS ZHIKAI (ph) Objection, Your Honor. The witness has been asked to testify as to a legal conclusion and that's a decision that's left to the trier of fact. 

00:14:15
JUDGE JONES Ms. Scarnecchia, your response? 

00:14:15
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA Your Honor, I'm not asking for a legal conclusion. I'm asking for her opinion as a mental health expert and that is admissible under our rules of evidence. 

00:14:25
JUDGE JONES Objection overruled. Please continue. 

00:14:30
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA In your own evaluation of this family… 

00:14:30
NARRATOR Professionals who are not familiar with the adversarial nature of the courtroom may find the experience daunting. John Myers offers his advice. 

00:14:40
JOHN MYERS You live through this experience, many more have been there before you and come out not much thoughts aware(ph). Remember it's the advisory system, it's designed to be confrontational ah… by enlarged, we lawyers don't take it personally we have a job to do and that job is to point out the weaknesses as well as the strengths in what you have to say. So, don't take it personally. 

00:15:05
SALLY CHURCHILL You have any from children's hospital or anywhere else? 

00:15:05
NARRATOR Professor Sallie Churchill and social worker Carol Plummer are associates of Dr. Faller at the University of Michigan family assessment clinic. They recall their experience in the courtroom and offer suggestions for enduring the ideal. 

00:15:20
CAROL PLUMMER , ACSW Clinical Social Worker, Family Assessment Clinic University of Michigan You need to realize that your function primarily is to educate either the jury or the judge regarding why you have done what you have, ah… why it is that this child's behavior is or is not consistent with sexual abuse. So I think that keeping in mind that you're an educator and that you don't need to be defensive is critical. 

00:15:45
SALLIE CHURCHILL , PhD Consultant, Family Assessment Clinic University of Michigan I'm not on trial I… I am don't have to feel defensive, because I'm a social worker and I know the material that I'm presenting and I respond with as much authority as I can and clarity and sometimes with humor, but it's real important that I not feel threatened by what can be seemingly in any other circumstance quite offensive interviewing and challenging. 

00:16:20
LIMITS ON TESTIMONY 

00:16:25
DENNIS ZHIKAI (ph) Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay. 

00:16:25
JUDGE JONES Ms. Scarnecchia, what's your response? 

00:16:30
SULLEYN SCARNECCHIA Your Honor, this is admissible under the Hearsay exception, which allows statements for purposes of diagnosis and treatment. 

00:16:35
NARRATOR Bear in mind that different courts allow different types of testimony from witnesses. One type of testimony that is not permitted is the so called Hearsay evidence. 

00:16:45
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA And what is your opinion? There are limitations placed on expert witnesses in terms of what they can say and one of the biggest limitations that's most frustrating for mental health expert is the limitation on Hearsay evidence. You're often on permitted to say what the child actually told you. And this can be very frustrating because again your goal is to tell as much as you can to support you conclusions, but because of Hearsay rules, you may not be able to say what the child said or what someone else said to you outside of court. Um… this is something that you should go over as you're being prepared by a prosecutor or whoever is called you to stand and know for sure what it is you will likely be able to say and what you won't. 

00:17:25
HEARSAY EVIDENCE Statements or comments made out of court Includes statements made by a child to a clinician Out of court statements by the child about sexual abuse are hearsay 

00:17:30
NARRATOR Hearsay Evidence is defined as statements or comments made out of court. This includes statements made by a child to a clinician such as a therapist or social worker. Therefore, out of court statements by the child about sexual abuse or hearsay and may not be repeated by others in court, unless they fit under one or the exceptions to the hearsay rule. 

00:17:50
DEMONSTRATION 

00:17:50
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER Shall I tell you a little bit about what we're going to do today? Okay? 

00:17:55
JOHN MYERS Whenever you talk to a child who may have been abused, what that child says in psychotherapy or in an forensic interview is often the most important evidence that can be used in later legal proceedings to protect that child. What the child says is, of course important clinically and it's important in deciding whether the child has been abused during the interview process, but what mental health professionals perhaps, don't realize is that what the child says can be used in court, sometimes in lieu of the child's testimony to protect the child in criminal or civil proceedings later on, if and here is the if. If the mental health professionals know what to watch for and document, so that they, if you will preserve the kind of information that the legal system need to use the child's statement later on in, in court and the reason for that is because what a child tells you during an interview whether it's a forensic evaluation or purely psychotherapeutic interview is hearsay. And in every state in the United States hearsay is not allowed in court. 

00:19:00
NARRATOR The key therefore, is to determine whether a child's statements fall within one or more exceptions to the hearsay rule, which would allow them to be repeated in court. 

00:19:10
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER …and at that point, Cynthia(ph) made an allegation of sexual abuse and want… 

00:19:15
JOHN MYERS What mental health professionals, I hope will kind of increasingly to release is that they play the key role in determining whether children's hearsay statements can be used in court and all they have to do to increase the likelihood of that is know what to watch for and document during the interview. 

00:19:30
NARRATOR There are three specific exceptions to the hearsay rules that forensic evaluators should be aware of. 

00:19:35
EXCEPTIONS Excited utterance 

00:19:35
JOHN MYERS First is the Excited Utterance exception to the hearsay rule. Remember, we have to start with the proposition that what a child says during an interview is hearsay, not allowed in court. But if what the child says during an interview is made very shortly after a very startling event such as child abuse. Minutes maybe up to a couple of hours afterward then the child's statement may be an excited utterance and admissible. The kinds of things that professionals can watch for, and of course, these are usually professionals who are on the scene pretty quickly, somebody who is in the emergency room, police officer, social worker from child protective services and something like that. Who sees the child shortly following an abusive episode, but the kinds of things they can look for are the nature of the event, some events are more starling than others, how much time went by between the abuse and the time the interview occurs that's critically important. Was the child emotionally distort and upset or calm for example, was the child in pain, um… was the statement a spontaneous description of something that happened or that the interview repel the statement out of the child with a repetitive or perhaps leading questions. And those are the principle factors to look for. 

00:20:45
Exceptions Excited utterance Medical diagnosis or treatment exception 

00:20:50
JOHN MYERS The other principle exception to the hearsay rule that applies is called the Medial diagnosis or treatment exception. Now this is a rule, a legal rule that allows statements to healthcare providers doctors, nurses and in many states, psychotherapists as well. But not police officers and probably not a mental health professional who is doing a purely legal intervention. But, if there are some elements of both therapy and forensic assessment, exception might well apply. Basically, if a child makes a statement to a healthcare professional in order to obtain medical care or therapeutic intervention, the child's statement will be admissible probably in later legal proceedings and as you know often times children make very revealing disclosure statements to healthcare providers. What should the professional watch for? Well, basically make sure that the child understands when talking to a healthcare provider the importance of telling the truth, make sure the child understands your role as a healthcare provider, I'm here to help you, I'm a doctor, I'm a nurse ah… whatever the case might be. Ah… perhaps, do a little testing to see if the child understands the nature of your role, and then document these factors carefully so that if legal proceedings happen later on you can remember that these were the kinds of factors that were important. 

00:22:15
EXCEPTIONS Excited utterance Medical diagnosis or treatment exception "Catch all" exception 

00:22:15
JOHN MYERS And then one last exception. It's sort of a Catch all and that is if a child makes a statement that doesn't fit within one of the other pigeon holes, excited utterance, medical diagnosis or treatment, but it's still a reliable statement then the judge will consider everything that shed any light on whether the child was telling the truth. So, from the professionals point of view, anything that you can document that indicates that when a child disclosed the child was telling the truth, chart it down. It will be invaluable later on in legal proceedings. 

00:22:45
JUDGE JONES Objection overruled. Please continue. 

00:22:50
NARRATOR In addition to hearsay evidence, there are also limitations as to what expert witnesses may conclude about the allegation or sexual abuse. 

00:22:55
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA And the question is Dr. Faller, do you have an opinion as to who was the offender, who did sexually abuse Cynthia(ph)? 

00:23:05
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER I do. 

00:23:05
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA And who is that? 

00:23:05
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER Her step-father. 

00:23:05
NARRATOR Once again this varies from state-to-state and from court-to-court. So be certain, you understand what the limitations are where you will be testifying. 

00:23:15
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER My own view is that you should have an opinion, you shouldn't go to court saying well, these are the data that I collected and make of them what you will. Usually there are some specific questions that the forensic evaluators has been asked to address and they need to be sure that they've addressed those and can communicate that to the court when they go to court. So in this adversarial arena, what your partisan towards is not toward say the mother's side or the father's side or the state's side, but rather your partisan towards your findings, your opinion in this case. And the implication of that is that um… that essentially anything you looked at to form that opinion is something that you should be quite willing to communicate to the court. 

00:24:00
SUELLYN SCARNECCHAI I think it takes a lot of courage to testify in these cases, um… you will be cross-examined often times someone's freedom is at stake based on what you say and in order to advocate for the child you have to have the personal courage to sit there, to withstand the nervousness and… and perhaps, fear and to just give very honest answers. Judges and juries believe people who admit when they make mistakes, who admit when they don't know something who understand that there may be gray areas in doing an evaluation, those are all good things to do, if in fact you don't understand something or forgot something. But, and those are the witnesses who carry the most weight in our court system, because when it comes down to it, regardless of your education or your experience, if the judge or the jury believes you, you've then been a very helpful witness to the child. 

00:24:55
HOW CHILDREN CAN BE PREPARED TO TESTIFY 

00:25:00
JUDGE JONES Adrian, do you know why we're here today? Okay. My name is Judge Jones and we're here today to find out what a bunch of people have to say about this case. 

00:25:10
NARRATOR In addition to the forensic evaluator, the child involved in the case may also be called to testify. In fact, in a criminal case the child is likely to be the key witness. This child is not an abuse victim, but rather an actress who agreed to participate in the program with her parents' permission for demonstration purposes. When children are required to testify there are several factors that can affect their willingness to report an incident of abuse. For one, the courtroom is a strange and often intimidating place making it difficult for some children to reliably offer testimony. 

00:25:45
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER There are lots of things that make it difficult for children to testify in court. First of all, the whole courtroom context that's a very different room from rooms that most children spend their time in. They don't go to court, they may see court on TV, but they don't usually enter courtroom. Secondly, it's all grownups there, you know this is not a kids place, this is a grownups place. Third, obviously, the um… the person who, in most cases the person who allegedly sexually abused them as there. Many times the child has been separated if it's a… if a family member from that person since disclosure um… and if it's somebody who is an extra familiar offender, they haven't ah… you know that person hasn't had any access to that child. In most cases, so in a sense this is often the first time the child has to confront the person, since the child disclosed the sexual victimization. The whole process of being ask questions as you sit up there in a little box is really a very foreign experience for most children. They feel, many cases quite threatened and challenged by that. And of course, cross-examination is also quite difficult for them. Sitting still for a long time for many children is quite difficult and that needs to be appreciated when you think about what you're asking kids to do. 

00:27:15
Did your mom ever talk to you about court? 

00:27:20
Nuhuh. 

00:27:20
Well court is where they decide whether to put somebody in jail. And I go there sometimes I talk to the judge. And the judge is the one who decides. 

00:27:35
NARRATOR When it is likely that a child will testify the forensic evaluator can help prepare the child for the experience in several ways.

KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER Here are a variety of different things that I personally do as a forensic evaluator to begin to concretize the… the court process. Sometimes I, we have some cards that that actually portray the sort of scenario of the court and I may use those to introduce the child to the courtroom to the various players in the court, the judge, the defense attorney, the prosecutor, the pictures also give an opportunity to show the child, the place where the child will be sitting. Um… another thing that I may do is we may actually draw a picture, the child and myself of the courtroom. There also you know giving same actress so that the child know who all the actors are who are going to be present. There are other ways of doing this there are books that have been produced usually by courts that describe the particular court and… and question that can be used their coloring books that can be used. Um… so there're there're a variety of different kinds of ways of doing this. 

00:28:50
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA You come right through here, Adrian. And this is the courtroom. I want to show you around while nobody is here. When we're here and the case is really going to go on, there are going to be people in all these seats and even some people sitting out here. Okay. So I want to tell you who all those people are going to be and where they are going to be sitting. So the first thing I want to tell you… 

00:29:05
NARRATOR When a child does go to court, another professional such as the prosecuting attorney or a witness assistant might introduce the child to the courtroom itself giving the child the opportunity to become familiar with the environment and the people he or she will encounter there. 

00:29:25
SUELLYN SCARNECCHIA One of the things that's used often by prosecutors and children's attorneys is a tour of the courtroom, so that when no one is in the courtroom the child has an opportunity to look around, become familiar with the courtroom, see where she is going to sit, look at the microphone and see that it can adjust up and down so that it can be moved down to um… her height. Talk about how loudly you have to speak in the courtroom to be heard and talk about where the jury is going to be sitting, what they're going to look like, and then really let her go and try out each of the seats, so that she knows what it would be like um… to be in each of those seats, even the judge's seats. So she can she what it's like to be sitting up on the bench and to see where the witness is in comparison to the judge. If the judge was really here, no one is allowed to walk up here, but since the courtroom is empty we can come in here. And this is where the judge will sit, you want to take a seat and see what it feels like to sit up here? And then, of course, the kind of preparation I would do with any other witness I would do with the child in terms of letting her know what kind of questions I'm going to be asking, preparing her for cross-examination, giving her some hints to for instance, focus on someone she is comfortable within the courtroom if she gets nervous. You feel pretty comfortable? Okay. Alright, let's practice for a minute. And when I ask you the questions, I'm gonna stand over here, because here's gonna be members of the jury sitting here, the people that are gonna decide the case, they're gonna up on this bench. So I'm going to stand over here and when you answer my questions, you'll be looking right at the jury that's what… that way they can see you better. Okay? 

00:31:00
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER There are other things that you need to do as well. One is to let the child know that probably the defendant is going to be there, um… that is the person who is accused will be there that they won't be allowed to do anything to the child, but they will be present in the courtroom that there will be a bailiff there or a sheriff or somebody a policeman will be there to prevent the person from harming the child. Um… and that the child in fact, doesn't have to look at that person. The child can look away except ah… when the child is required to identify the person. 

00:31:35
NARRATOR Because of their age, many children are at a disadvantage when cross-examined. Remind the child that the job of the defense attorney is to convince the judge or the jury that the event never happened. 

00:31:50
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER I talk about that there will be an attorney who will ask you questions, and then there will be another attorney and that's you know Mr. Jones' attorney and know that he might ask you some hard questions and he might ask… ask you some trick questions. And if you don't understand the questions, you tell him you feel like he his trying to scare you, you tell the judge that and so that you prepare the child to not be bold over by what may well be a vigorous cross-examination. 

00:32:25
A FINAL WORD 

00:32:30
KATHLEEN COULBORN FALLER Another thing that to me is important in dealing with the court process is to appreciate that you are there to educate, you are not the ultimate decision maker that the judge or the jury will be listening to your testimony along with a lot of other testimony in many cases and they are the people who sort of pull all the pieces together and come up with the final opinion. It's not you, you go and you present your particular view, um… but I think it helps, at least it helps me in sort of dealing um… with some of my own sort of personal issues around going to court to appreciate that my role is that as of an educator with a particular um… body of information and of an opinion based on that, but I'm not in charge of the court. 

00:33:20
JOHN MYERS Remember that unless you're willing to go to court and tell what you know either as an expert who is providing their judgment about whether a child was abused or as a non-expert who is there simply to repeat what a child said. Unless you are willing to do that, to fill that difficult role the legal system doesn't have a (inaudible ) protecting children. We can't do the job of protecting children unless professionals are willing to go into court and go through the rigorous of direct and cross-examination.
