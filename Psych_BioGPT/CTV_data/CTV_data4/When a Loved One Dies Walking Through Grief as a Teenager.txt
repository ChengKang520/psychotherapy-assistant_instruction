Walking Through Grief as a Teenager

Alicia Franklin, LCSW 

00:02:40
Grief management specialist 

00:02:40
ALICIA FRANKLIN Hi, my name is Alicia Franklin, I'm a grief counselor, I work with children and teens who are experiencing the death of a loved one. When I was four my brother Austin died of a malignant brain tumor, he was 13 months old and I loved him more than anything. I hope by seeing my experience and the experience of the other people on the video, that you can learn a little bit more about your grief and find some things that will help you with your journey through the grief process. 

00:03:15
the way your loved one died can have a big effect on you 

00:03:20
ALICIA FRANKLIN The way someone died can really affect a lot of things that affects how much time you had to prepare, whether you got to say goodbye to the person, the kind of things that you were able to do ahead of time. And then it's going to affect the way that you react to the person's death and the way that you react to the news that you receive. 

00:03:45
when a loved one died by illness 

00:03:50
JEREMY PASKER My Grandmother I found out because my grandfather, he was driving a car with her, she like passed out, while in next hour. So he took her to the hospital and then she died there. 

00:04:05
MOLLY GILFEATHER We already knew that he was going to die after some time, few months may be, but I, I didn't know like when he was going to die and my mother told me the day that he died. 

00:04:20
ALICIA FRANKLIN When your loved one dies by an illness, they could die very quickly or you may have more time to prepare. It's important to realize though that even if you had a long time to prepare, all deaths are unexpected, it's important not to allow others to minimize your pain, talking about at least you had time to get ready, all deaths are hard to deal with. 

00:04:45

when a loved one dies by an accident 

00:04:55
MICHELLE VALENTIN The street, he was in the street and the car coming down the road and he has got commence in the way and he saw the cars coming so he pushed her out of the way and he got the hit of the car. 

00:05:05
ALICIA FRANKLIN When a loved one dies by accident, this can be a very traumatic and frightening to your family, the life was going on in one direction and all of a sudden boom, something happened, a phone call, a terrible accident. This can leave people asking why, why our family? Why now? Why this person? Why did this happen? It can also leave people feeling guilty, maybe if I hadn't let him go out, maybe if I had said no, what if I hadn't said, I hate you as the last words that someone walked out the door, and so there's some extra guilt that can go along with it. There's also a little bit of fear that can come when someone dies by an accident, could this happen to me is that something that could happen to another loved one. 

00:05:55
when a loved one dies by suicide 

00:06:05
CHRIS BARRY In my past I was actually suicide at one point and I found myself in church asking God, why anybody else would either feel the way I felt. But, I had a few heroes that brought me out of it. And I wish that I could have been there beat to bring this person out of it. I wish that God would have allowed me the chance to stop my friend, to bring my friend to a few people that in the same way that someone brought me to someone. 

00:06:35
ALICIA FRANKLIN When your loved one dies by suicide, this can be a very confusing time for families. Some people may be feeling very shocked and surprised, other people may be feeling guilty because they feel like maybe they could have done something to prevent it, others may feel angry with the person who died for abandoning them or for taking their own life. This is sometimes a difficult kind of death to talk about with others because so many people have very strong feelings about it. There are many support groups, that can help and touching base with someone else who has had a loved one die by suicide can sometimes be extremely comforting. 

00:07:10

00:07:15
when a loved one dies by homicide 

00:07:20
SHANNYN LUNDBOHM The day that I found out the memories I had were probably, there's good and bad, there's memories of everything that we've been through for entire life, and the bad memories we're just finding out. Thinking about why it have to happen to him, why did they do it to him. 

00:07:40
ALICIA FRANKLIN When a loved one is killed by homicide, it can leave a family feeling intensely angry, angry with the person who killed your loved one, angry with a legal system that may be you perceive isn't handling things the right way. Maybe even angry with the media and with the attention that they're giving to the homicide or even to the grieving family, this is a really difficult emotion to have, and it's hard for people who care about you because they're not quite sure what to do or how to help. You maybe feeling angry or bitter, you might even be wanting to seek revenge. There are wonderful support groups available to help with these kind of feelings. 

00:08:20

00:08:25
when a grandparent dies 

00:08:30
JULIA LOBO Just like all the memories of me and my grandfather came back to me when I was sitting and was crying and I was just thinking, and I remember as a little girl how, who used to… cha… who use chasing me and to think like that and the thing about is that, I hadn't seen my grandfather for about nine years. Like I used to live, when I am, when I was a little girl but then I love, when I was like five years old, and ever since I haven't seen him. And I remember one day, the day that it was coming to leave with him, to leave him, he was like, I guess this is a good bye for ever. And as I was sitting there I remember those words coming to me. And I, and I thought to myself I guess that was a good bye forever. But I never took it like that to think of it, as being good bye, I just thought it was just something he used to say to me as a little girl. 

00:09:25
ALICIA FRANKLIN It's very difficult when a grandparent dies for a couple of reasons, one sometimes you find that Piers may not take that as a serious death, and it really is. When a grandparent dies who is our history, who was our family heritage, maybe the person who spoiled or rotten a little bit. The other piece is that sometimes now grandparents are taking the role of parents and so this may be a grandparent death from the outside but a parent death for you. 

00:09:55
[sil.] 

00:10:00
When a parent dies 

00:10:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, we were on holidays on Fathers day, that's when it's hard and I do feel that my dad is still with me and you feel that he looks after me. And he watches over me and I ask him for help sometimes. 

00:10:20
ALICIA FRANKLIN A parent death is also difficult because when a parent dies we're talking about losing safety, security, maybe that involves moving somewhere else. If you were living with the parent who died you may be worried about who will take care of me now, what kind of things are we going to do for cooking the food or paying the bills, making sure my homework gets done, those kind of things. When we're talking about the long term, a parent death means who's going to see me graduate, who will walk me down the aisle, and so looking into the future and seeing the role of that parent and saying who can fill in for me, who can do that for me. A parent death is also the loss of someone who comforted you, or maybe coached you and pushed you to be your very best. 

00:11:10
[music] 

00:11:15
When a sibling dies 

00:11:20
JEREMY PASKER After my grandfather told me that my brother passed. I, I took a long walk, I said and I've talked about, no I, I thought about, about what we did together, could I have seen him more, could I have treated him better, could we have, could we have had a better relationship. 

00:11:45
ALICIA FRANKLIN The death of a sibling can be difficult because it's the loss of a companion or maybe a rival. The loss of a peer could be the loss of the only other person who knew your parents quite as well as you did. Another very difficult part about having a sibling die is the feeling that some people have of living with a ghost, living with someone who maybe did things better or maybe didn't do things better, and worrying about having to compete with someone who can't make mistakes anymore. And so it's important to figure out what role you play in the family, and if there are roles that your sibling played that you would like to take on out of a memory or a tribute that's fine. But it's important that you continue to be yourself and not try to fill the holes that your sibling is leaving behind. 

00:12:35
When a friend dies 

00:12:40
MICHELLE VALENTIN I lost Johnny, a good friend of mine, I want to thank you so much Johnny for being that friend I had, I love you and I'll always miss you and friends and family will always miss you. 

00:13:00
ALICIA FRANKLIN With the death of a friend can come loneliness, sometimes people say that this was the person I trusted the most and now they're gone, I'm not sure if I should make another friend and take a chance. It's also vulnerability, if this could happen to my friend could it happen to me. We have a sense of security that we walk around with every day, it's how you go outside and not feel like something could happen to you. And when someone of our own age dies it becomes kind of scary, because I hadn't considered that I could die and all of a sudden I realize I might. 

00:13:35
[music] 

00:13:40
Emotions that follow a loss 

00:13:45
ALICIA FRANKLIN Each person experiences loss in their own way but some of the experiences that people share include a feeling of numbness, anger, anger towards the person who died, anger at God. Anger at someone that you felt may have done something to cause the death, or didn't do something that could have prevented it, guilt, depression, and intense sadness. 

00:14:10
JEREMY PASKER I have really good relationship with him though, I basically, I can't describe how much pain I was in when my brother died. 

00:14:20
MOLLY GILFEATHER I thought that the doctor could have done something about it. I was angry at God. I didn't think it was fair. 

00:14:30
CHRIS BARRY I was angry because I felt that when he killed himself he was taken away from his friends his family and I was sad because I lost a friend. 

00:14:40
POOJA SAMMETA With my grandfather it was really hard that I found out because I was close to him and I grew up with him. So and he raised me, he came to this country and raised me, 'cause he was from India. And so it was hard to find out that he had gone because he was a big part of my life and he was always home and I would go and visit, so it was a big shock to me. 

00:15:05
JULIA LOBO When I heard the news I was just a denial like, I didn't believe it, I didn't, I couldn't, and like it was just a big surprise, my mother to be in the hospital everything just happening so quickly. I mean, I woke up it was 3 o'clock in the morning and were rushing to my aunt's house. We're putting everything away, everybody's crying, I have nobody there to hold me, hug me like my mother wasn't there, I only had my little sisters and I had to look after my little sister. I always doing that, telling my little sisters everything's gonna be okay. And those were really hard. 

00:15:40
SHANNYN LUNDBOHM The phone call was very terrifying, terrible, it was, it impacted on my whole family and myself very much. It brought a new meaning to like death, and life, and everything. 

00:15:55
[music] 

00:16:00
Physical effects that you may experience after a loss 

00:16:05
CHRIS BARRY It was still very recent so I cannot still, loosing my appetite, I haven't been eating much. 

00:16:15
JULIA LOBO When I got a news Amelia started shaking, I felt numb and I felt like nervous, I don't know what, my mind was just clear, I didn't have any thoughts or anything like that in my head just, I was sitting there just paused like my body, my whole body paused for a minute, I was just. And I am on toes, you can, I can feel my heart like just be in a flow like I was going out of breath. 

00:16:40
ALICIA FRANKLIN It's normal for you to have feelings of dizziness, confusion, for stomach aches to happen, even stomach problems, sleepy even if you slept, or not very sleepy, nauseous, problems with swallowing or breathing it's normal to have body aches. Because what ends up happening is your body has such incredible pain that's going through it from an emotional standpoint that it spills over into your physical reactions. 

00:17:10
[music] 

00:17:15
Putting off the reality that your loved one has died 

00:17:20
CHRIS BARRY It took a couple of days, couple of days to realize that lost a friend. 

00:17:25
POOJA SAMMETA With my grandfather it took, it, it shocked me at first, I was just shocked, I was like what? He is in the hospital, he, and then when I heard he died a couple hours later I was just like, wow, what just happened like he was just alive. 

00:17:40
ALICIA FRANKLIN Many people experience numbness or a feeling of it's not real, when they find out that their loved one has died. This may feel like being on automatic pilot or walking through a fog or a dream. 

00:17:55
SHANNYN LUNDBOHM After he died, it was basically hoping he would come back, hoping that he'd walk in to a family party and he'd be fine, nothing happened but of course now, that he didn't come back. 

00:18:15
ALICIA FRANKLIN Sometimes you may experience wondering if your loved one's going to call, or walk in the door, walking through a crowd and seeing the back of someone's head and wondering if it's them. That's really difficult when all of a sudden the person turns around and it's not your loved one, because then the reality of their death comes rushing right back in. 

00:18:35
MOLLY GILFEATHER Sometimes I think that he's still alive and that's when it's really hard to forget that he's dead. 

00:18:40
ALICIA FRANKLIN Some people call this time denial, I prefer the word postponement, or just a little bit of numbness, because usually inside your heart you know what's going on, you know what's happening. This may feel like a really scary time you made even feel, "Hey, like I am, may be I am crazy here, or something was happening to me," and that's okay. This is actually a really normal and healthy time, it's a good time for your body to begin to gather the energy that it's going to need for the long grief journey ahead. 

00:19:20
Being involved in a wake, funeral, or memorial service 

00:19:25
ALICIA FRANKLIN After the death of your loved one you may be given the opportunity to be a part of the funeral or the memorial service. This can be a really helpful time because when you see the body and when you receive support from other loved ones it can really connect with understanding that your loved one has died. 

00:19:45
UNKNOWN Well, I went to the lake and we all had a the canary students that were in a shop, we just in our uniforms and we paid our respects to the family and friends. 

00:20:00
JEREMY PASKER I asked my, my cousin she's like a poem writer, started to see a poem to my brother. 

00:20:05
JULIA LOBO I couldn't be part of the funeral service but we did like a little memorial at the house ourselves because he lives all the way in Cape Town. 

00:20:10
CHRIS BARRY I was unable to go to the funeral due to other obligations but I wrote a letter to the family. 

00:20:20
POOJA SAMMETA His funeral was actually good because it helped closure, because I also went to the, when we actually umm… we were in the cemetery, so I was actually there and I got to see how that was done. Because usually in my culture actually we're not supposed to go, to the funeral women aren't allowed. We're just allowed to go to the wake. I mean watching someone being put into the ground that was a bit hard for me to understand. 

00:20:40
ALICIA FRANKLIN There are lots of different ways that you can participate and the neat thing as is that you can pick what you're comfortable with. But even if you're not able to attend the funeral or be a part of the memorial service, because it's too far away or because you're feeling emotionally not ready. It's really important for you to find a way to have some sort of a ritual or something that you do to feel that you can say what you need to, to your loved one. 

00:21:10
[music] 

00:21:15
Emotions you may have when you return to school 

00:21:20
SHANNYN LUNDBOHM When I do go back to school, everyone talking about their summers and how great it was, it was like, when they'd ask me, I'd try to basically laid off like it was okay. But, I had to cope with the issue of my cousin dying and being murdered, not, for him not being there, to have fun during the summer. 

00:21:40
JEREMY PASKER I went to school like a week, and I had revisions to take and then after that I took, I took a week off. And my friends, they were like why did I just take the we off first and then take two weeks off instead of staying at school. The emotion was taking to school out, I had to concentrate, I just basically had to say to my self I have to do this or I would just fail. 

00:22:05
MOLLY GILFEATHER I went back to school a week after he died, it's really hard I remember crying in school all the time in front of all the kids and which is embarrassing. 

00:22:15
ALICIA FRANKLIN You may be worried about going back to school after your loved one has died, this can be kind of a scary time because you're not quite sure what people are going to say, not quite sure how to answer the questions that they may ask. You might even be worried about, will I be able to make it through the day, how will I be able to concentrate on my work. If you let teachers and people know that you're having a difficult time concentrating and why, they usually understand a little bit. Friends may be concerned about saying the wrong thing and it's important not to interpret silence as a lack of caring. If there are friends that you need extra support from, it's okay to ask for that and tell them exactly what you need. 

00:23:00
Getting support for yourself as you grieve 

00:23:05
JULIA LOBO And I, I remember, at lunch time like everybody was like, Julia what's the matter, what's the matter, what's the matter. And it's just made me like, get very angry. I am sitting and I didn't tell them what's the matter and that's my fault. But at the same time, I am getting angry at them for no reason, because anyways they are happy. And I am sitting there and tears starts are not coming down my eyes I start crying everybody just stops me and, you know, I have all this attention on me that I am crying and I'm crying, and my friends comforts me like, it's okay to cry. And we can't just hold it in and that's all whatever happened and she told everybody else, you know, like oh, okay. And everybody else was there for me so I got a lot of support from my friends in school and they helped out a lot. 

00:23:45
CHRIS BARRY Well, I got some letters from friends but mostly my dad supported me, my dad was always there for me and the Bible always helps you 'cause the Bible is great, got many answers to it and God is always there. 

00:24:00
ALICIA FRANKLIN There are a few things, that you can do to help yourself when you're coping with the death of a loved one. The first one is finding supportive friends and others, figuring out what kind of help you need and letting them know do you need to talk about the person who died, or would you really rather have some quiet time. Sometimes we end up getting caught in a trap of saying, I'm not doing this right, or it's taking too long, or something's wrong with me, and when we can just step back and say grief takes a long time and it doesn't feel like you need to rush through it, and you know question yourself so much. This is all normal, and it's new and there's not a manual about how to do it. 

00:24:40
Moving on with your life while remembering your loved one 

00:24:45
ALICIA FRANKLIN Coping with the death of a loved one involves acknowledging of the person who has died and that's different than accepting, because accepting almost sounds like I'm agreeing with it, and I don't agree with it. Coping with the death of a loved one means, acknowledging that there are changes in your life, that you're different than you were before. 

00:25:10
MICHELLE VALENTIN The way I dealt with John's death, was by writing him a poem, I also went to church and I wrote a prayer inside a book that we have in church, you know, wrote his name and evoked him a message. And, and we said to God up above to take care of him. 

00:25:30
SHANNYN LUNDBOHM This death has affected me greatly for just because of the fact that I realize it happens so that I could be more comfortable with my family, love them, never, try not to have fights or conflicts with them that just the fact that you don't know what's gonna happen, you never know. 

00:25:50
JULIA LOBO One day you're just going to wake up and going to realize that the person is gone, and you're going to need to realize that, you need to move on with your life. And you can even meet people that will help you go through that just don't keep to yourself, make sure you talk to people about it and make sure you do what's best for you. 

00:26:10
ALICIA FRANKLIN Grief is not about forgetting or about saying goodbye to your loved one forever. Grief means acknowledging the feelings that you're having and the emotions that you're experiencing, and finding a new way to relate to your loved one. 

00:26:25
JEREMY PASKER Uh… to say that if I, if I, you have a family member that dies or friend that died, you just have to remember them basically. 

00:26:35
POOJA SAMMETA For my grandfather in our culture we every umm… month for one year we went to the temple and we did a ceremony. 

00:26:40
SHANNYN LUNDBOHM Umm… on his birthday and his anniversary we go to his grave and we set balloons into the air, umm… drink his favorite drinks, well, the adults do. We, we drink his favorite like soda and have cake and basically just hang out there for a little while, and listen to some of his favorite music. 

00:27:00
MICHELLE VALENTIN Make sure for Johnny and was his picture on the front and had said Johnny Boucher in the year that he was in school, and in the back it said canary class of 2002. He was so special that I decided to write a poem for him. And that poem (inaudible ), It's just like I don't cry over it, I get happy because it reminds me of the good times we had. And umm… I give it upon to his mother, so, as a memory and respects that I had for him and his family. 

00:27:40
JULIA LOBO You have to think this person is gone, what would this person want me to be doing at that time would this person want me just be sitting down, be a sad or would this person want me to move on in my life and become something that they would, would be proud to see me become. 

00:27:55
[music] 

00:28:10
Grief is a journey that can begin with pain. anger, and despair. 

00:28:15
But as you work with your grief and accept the changes it has brought, you will find healing and hope in your future.
