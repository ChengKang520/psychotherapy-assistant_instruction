DR. HARRIET LERNER Thank you for the introduction and I wanna thank Jeff Sage for inviting me back. Uhm, it's an honor and a privilege to be here with you. And Jeff, ah, Jeff is one of my heroes he's really a force of nature. Who else could get 8000 therapists under roof, it's sort of a scary thought but wonderful. My subject is impossible relationships and we all have one or more of this that we navigate for better, uhm, or for worst and I'd like to begin, uhm, in a personal self disclosing note because in addition to my professional qualifications to talk to you about relationships, I'm also obviously a person in relation. I've been married to my husband Steve for over 40 years. We have two married sons, so I have grandchildren, I have colleagues, friends in-laws, out-laws. And because I'm a relationship expert and because I'm a bestselling author I get all of my relationships exactly right. You might say perfectly so I move through my relational world with perfect calm, clarity and wit much like a saint or a highly evolves in Buddhist. But I, an-- I have notice, uhm, I actually have notice that for other people that relationships are source of a great deal of anger and disappointment and pain and just playing hard times. One way to think about the inevitable difficulty of relationships is to consider the impact of anxiety on individuals and human systems. And before we get to The Magnificent Seven I wanna talk a little bit about this, from my theoretical prospective everyone has an anxiety disorder that disrupts our functioning in relationships. Now this is not to minimize the enormous pain of people who suffer from severe anxiety and the affects of trauma. It simply to say that anxiety disrupts functioning for all of us and that anxiety is the culprit behind downward spiraling relationships in both the personal and the political spear. Now when I referred to anxiety I'm not referring to what gets you, ah, DSM diagnosis. I'm referring to anxiety that operates as a chronic underground force and individuals and all human systems. Anxiety that cascades down the generations and combines with anxiety that accumulates as we move along the life cycle and in the dailiness of living. We often don't recognize anxiety for the culprit the underground force that it really is because anxiety disrupts that most basic human capacity to think about our thinking and to distinguish real feelings which are in essential source of information, uhm, versus anxious reactivity. Plus, it's not just individuals who get anxious. Systems get anxious and every system we operate in marital system, family system, school, works system, political system has an anxiety disorder of its very own separate from the individuals who comprise it. And in an anxious system everyone will always be passing along his or her anxiety to you. It's an automatic process, it's not anybody's villainess plan. Now from a Bowen family systems prospective we all react to anxiety by moving in relationships in five automatic predictable patterned ways. They're maybe 50 ways to leave your lover like the Paul Simon song says but only five ways according to Bowen theory to move in relationships under stress. And these are over functioning under functioning, blaming distancing and try anything. So, if you look at, ah, chronically anxious individual or system you'll see distancing just like a flight responds. The lines of communication are shut down people have stop taking about things that really matter or have cut off from each other. You know, people don't cut off from family members because they don't care about them they cut off because they enable to manage the intensity of the feelings that are built upon contact. So that's distancing. And under stress we see and increase in blaming people very quickly will become polarize they will divide into opposing camps. They will get over focus on what the other person is doing wrong and under focus on their own creative options to move differently into the intensify the situation. The higher the anxiety the more blaming leads to a narrowing of attention to a good guy, bad guy kind of thinking that inclines us to label or pathologies or diagnose individuals, uhm, rather than seeing the patterns in which we all participate. And being able, ah, blaming blocks the ability to see two sides of an issue or better yet six or seven sides because even to talk about two sides of an issue is an example of the, ah, human tendency to think in terms of dichotomous polarize thinking. So, it's better to say that blaming block says from seeing the many sidedness of things and the many sidedness of ourselves. And then of course try anything, uhm, the higher the anxiety the more intense in reaching triangles, my mother would be off the plane for two minutes before we would be in the corner and she would be saying, "Let me tell you what your dad has done now." Uhm, triangles are the basic unit of human relational functioning because anxiety does not stay contained in a diet. Uhm, very quickly a third party will be triangle in or will go into someone's camp and take sides at the expensive other family relationships. And, ah, triangles are normal but when they become rigidified, ah, I, I want to say that working on that triangle with my mother and my own family of origin which I work on my whole life, uhm, was what got me interested in doing family of origin work because the affects were so profound for me to learn to navigate my part in that triangle differently. So I say all this about anxiety and how we move in anxious systems because the older I get the-- the humbler I feel about relationships. Anxiety will always be with us, life is one thing after another, ah, we can't avoid anxiety. So I always remind people including my clients that given enough stress even the most mature relationship or system will begin to look like the most dysfunctional one or the most impossible one which is why I love Mary Karrs-- you know, the novelist Mary Karr. Her definition of a dysfunctional family is the best I've heard it's any family with more than one person in it. Now, of course it's a matter or more or less and more or less admittedly makes a big difference but still. So, with this back drop of the anxious soup that we all swim in, uhm, let's go to The Magnificent Seven. How many of you actually have hand outs of The Magnificent Seven that you can fallow along with me? Some of you this is the only conference I forgot, you know, the people don't printings out. Uhm, but that's okay because I'll tell you what each of them are. And the, the seven steps look you see but when you're dealing with the difficult person or difficult relationship nothing is simple or easy. And as I go through The Seven I would like to invite you to chose one of them only one to try out in a difficult relationship that you have. And I say, uhm, I invite you to think about doing something differently in that relationship because it is only after you do something different and maintain the change overtime that you can actually see that relationship. These seven steps are not about communications skills. Although, it's always a good idea to have them but the word communication is far to glib a term to understand what's involve in changing your pattern automatic raise of moving under stress. And rising to this challenge and working on one or two of this seven steps not only gives the relationships the best chance of succeedi0ng but it builds a, a greater platform of self worth and solid functioning. Uhm, for oneself however the other person responds and I think of the words of the great poet and feminist Adrienne Rich who said something like, uhm, I shouldn't paraphrase her because everything she says was beautiful but something like that, that sometimes we need to hear the sound of our own voice saying what we've really think out load. Irrespective of, you know, what we think of as for getting results. So, moving on to number one, number one is, that we can say what we think and feel about things that matter. I should add and also that we can allow the other person to the same without having to change or fix them. And this is at the heart of differentiation of self or autonomy emotional maturity whatever term you like to use to be able to say, "This is what I think. This is how I feel and this is how I see it differently." This ability to calmly speak to the differences while leaving room for the separate opinion of others as at the heart of differentiation of self which continues throughout a lifetime. Now, this is easy to do obviously to define the differences. If you're talking about a neutral topic like sports and the weather actually-- wait-- sports where I live home of the Kansas Jayhawks basketball team down the street. Uhm, it's not a neutral topic and the weather well, ah, this is no longer a neutral topic but they're must be a neutal-- okay, Meryl Streep in vanilla ice cream, right? We can all agree that those are really good things. So, it's gonna stir up a lot of anxiety to say for example to someone in your family, you know, you like-- I know that you like vanilla but in truth I prefer chocolate, you know. But it's extremely difficult to do if you're talking about is gonna stir up a lot o react-- a lot of reactivity and intensity in the self, the other, the system. For example I was seeing Joyce(ph) in therapy and her sister's wedding was coming up and Joyce(ph) was planning to attend the weeding Melody(ph) her partner of 13 years. A week before the weeding Joyce's(ph) mother phoned and said quote, "Remember this is your sister's weeding so it is not necessary for you to bring attention to your relationship with Melody(ph)." Joyce(ph) said, "Oh, thanks a lot mom I'll just ask Melody(ph) to put a sack on her head, you know, to not, ah, to spare you for many embarrassment. Good bye." And she hang up the phone. Now this is a typical sequence in Joyce's(ph) adult life. And Joyce(ph) would feel in this interactions that she were standing up to her mother but actually she was protecting her mother and herself from a more mature way of speaking to the differences that invited real accountability and will put her mother and herself more in the hot seat. For example what if had taken some deep breaths on the phone and calmly ask her mother questions that would invite thinking like if she had said, "Uhm, mom, I'm not sure what you mean by not bringing attention to my relationship with Melody(ph). Could you say a little more about what your concern is?" Or, "Who in the family of the guest or friends are you most worried would have a negative reaction when Melody(ph) and I act as the real couple that, that we are?" Now Joyce(ph) go through the weeding and afterwards in therapy she began to developed a courage line of questioning. She been out to her parents for 20 years but there were so many questions that she never ask or revisited like, like, "Mom, what's the hardest part for you about my being gay? And how has that change for you since, you know, we first talk about it and over the past decades." It was very courageous for Joyce(ph) to ask this questions which is also such an essential aspect of the differentiation of self the ability to ask clear questions about, uhm, difficult issues. And receiving more courageous for Joyce(ph) to shift into a place of pure listening. And of course, you know, this is not one conversation, there is no important issue ever in a family or a marriage that gets process in one hidden run, ah, conversation. But having accomplish, having been in this process Joyce(ph) was able to speak calmly to the differences with her mother. And I wanna read to you what she said because it's a great example of step number. She said, "Mom, I was thinking, ah,-- I find myself thinking about our conversations since the weeding and, ah, I think that i-- if I understand you right there, there's a significant difference in how we see things. As I understand it you think that might being gay is a problem that maybe I was born and that you love anyway. I have a different view when I first in touch with my feelings toward women I felt scared I wonder what was wrong with me but really my relationship with Melody(ph) is the best thing that ever happen to me. And if I could push your button and magically turn the header sexual I wouldn't do it. And in fact I wouldn't do it if Melody(ph) were not in the picture. So what, what do you think, mom, about this difference this difference between us and how we see this?" Now if you think this is simple that means you haven't done it in your own family. It doesn't matter what the issue is. Okay. Number two the sentence is the like opposite of number one but it's not that we can reframe from sharing our thoughts and feelings when appropriate. This by the way is the most difficult for me of the, the seven, uhm, that we can think about how and when to say what to whom, we said Anna Quindlen who said that in a good marriage people get a lot of bite marks on their tongue. Uhm, same from mother and laws, mother and laws and it actually a special challenge in couple relationships because, you know, in couples people feel compelled to their partner everything they feel even when corrosive criticism and negativity is wearing the relationship down and eroding connection and, of course, the challenge is not just for couples in the name of authenticity, in the name of truth telling people parachute down and, and blodging really, uhm, approach to difficult issue in such an intense way or in such a critical way that they're actually closing down the lines of communication rather than widening the path for truth telling. And when I was younger I thought I use to think that timing intact and kindness were the opposite of honesty. And I believe that this are the very things that make honesty possible with the most difficult people in around the most difficult issue. Now another part of refraining is-- this is the hard one for me is learning to say it shorter. I really help my clients with this it can change your life. You know, anxiety pushes the polarity so when they're, when people are anxious either the lines or communication shut down entirely or people over talk thing. If you understand that's the other purity. People over talk things and, uhm, you know, I, I tend to do this if I'm anxious or I'm having a low self-esteem day and my husband Steve comes home from the ge-- from the store with five bananas of equal ripeness and they're only two of us. So, you know, there's like a really long lecture, you know, like I've talk to you before like it's five bananas and you know the three of them are gonna spoil. And yes, you can compost but that's not the same and like, you know, where are you in terms of your placing the environment. It's like, you know, "What kind of person does this sort of thing?" And "What's wrong with you?" "What's wrong with you", is a really great tag line I think Gottman says to bring a relationship down really fast. Uhm, you know, when, when you're criticizing someone-- if you're talking to someone defensive they taking very little information and it's really a skill to learn to say things shorter. Everyone who gets me as a therapist, gets me as an editor free people come in and bring me cuz I ask them to bring me this confrontive email, you know, to their sister whoever like three single space pages it would be if you printed it out. Uhm, when I say no and by the way if you take on thing from this lecture email is not place to ever process an important emotional issue. Okay? I, ah, I prohibit, I prohibit my clients, uhm, and if they don't listen I just consider it a really interesting experiment where we'll just look at the day that when it happens. Okay. Number three is calm things down. And on your handout it says calm things down it should say calm yourself down and, you know, this is about learning to pass on less anxiety than you receive. I help my clients to learn to pass on less anxiety than they receive. You know, learning to calm down our intensity and reactivity, I mean we learn this as a therapist, right? We learn to be a calm presents in an anxious emotional field. So if we can learn to do this with our clients theoretically we can learn to do it when our ex enters the room or, you know, or big sister in my case. And, you know, calm can be contagious just like intensity and reactivity are contagious and with clients nothing is gonna change and until I can help at least one of them get a grip on their, uhm, intensity so they begin to think and distinguish real feeling from their anxious reactivity. I-- of, of course people will always get reactive and I like Jon Kabat-Zinn's image of the mind like the surface of the ocean and the waves will always be weep around by weather. We will always be weep around by weather. And there is a deeper calm that we ca-- that's there if we can practice reaching for it. Now the most important question is how do you calm down and the answer is, "Anyway you can." Anyway. I mean there's so many ways that we calm down and help our clients learn to calm down there's many therapist and medications and, and things to do, ah, to help our clients sue their overheated nervous systems we have to sue their own first. Uhm, but anything worth doing requires practice so you can't be like the man, you know, the proverbial man who'll I shivering in bed but he's too tired to get up and get himself a blanket. So, you know, we needs to practice. Okay, number four, is that you we-- you can clarify the limits of what you can do and give. Historically this is been in a specially difficult one for women specially women in my generation, I'm 69 years old and in my generation women were raise to feel guilty if we were anything less than in emotional service station to others. In fact women learn to feel guilty about everything, you know, guilty about leaving their work for their children, and guilty about leaving their children for their work, and guilty if they didn't have children, and guilty if they didn't have work and guilty about feeling guilty cuz feeling guilty hurts children it doesn't help them, you know, which why I wrote The Dance of Anger. You know, nothing will block out the experience and expression of legitimate anger and protest so well as guilt will. So anyway, uhm, remember or you might remember if you're old enough there were all of these assertiveness training courses for women as if it's so simple like just saying, "No", you know, like to drugs just say "no" it's so simple. Uhm, assertiveness is inarguably a good id-- well actually, you know, the truth is that people may encourage to be a assertive but they only want you to be assertive if they like what you're saying. Because it's true. But it is inarguably a good idea, it's a cultural ideal now for both men and women for little girls and little boys that's good and Ellen Goodman tells a great story of her best friend has four little girls and says to each of her little daughters, "Speak up. Speak up. Speak up. Speak up." The only person you'll scare off is your future ex-husband. The fact is that this challenge of helping clients, ah, defined what they can do and give and for ourselves it-- it's actually extremely difficult. Because tacks into our deepest beliefs of what we feel entitle to and responsible for and how much anxiety and guilt that we can tolerate, uhm, for clarifying a physician which may shake us to the very core. And, uhm, I'm working-- I have quite a few actually women in my case load now who are dealing with elderly parents in trying to sort out, you know, what they can do and what do and consider for example, here's an example, Carolyn(ph), she's a therapy client who's 79-year-old mother wanted to leave her apartment in Florida to calm live with Carolyn(ph) in her big house in Kansas City. And in therapy looking at the genogram and I do a genogram and every client even if I'm using my three session model. Uhm, looking-- usually I do th-- usually for me therapy is a longer conversation, uhm, but I do also have a three session model and I use the genogram their too. So, looking at the genogram it became clear right away that parents over the generations had always been cared for, ah, in the home by eldest or not always eldest but daughters and-- or daughter in lose. And it also became clear that Carolyn(ph) would not survive emotionally if her mother were living in her house that, uhm, it would be two overwhelming for her. But what Carolyn(ph) was doing when she, you know, first came to see me in therapy she was trying to convince her mother that our mother won't be happy moving from Florida to Kansas. Like, you know, it's too cold here and we have ice and we have snow and your, your terrific endocrinologist leaves in Florida and you have your friends their etcetera, and her mother wanted to move in, move in with her. You know, it's really not possible to change your mother. If any of you have done it you should get up here and I'll sit down. So, I help her to get out to this ball game of trying to convince her mother to not wanna move and to really help her to define herself. I always coach people to do this in a loving way. Again, it's not one conversation but the beginning conversation went something like this, you know, eye language. Like, "Mom, I know that you wanna live with me and the problem for me is that although I love you so much it would be impossible for me to live with my mother. And it's very difficult for me to say this because I remember when gram move in with us and live with us until she died and I remember that you did everything for your own mother. And when I think about it don't even remember you're ever saying, "no" to her. And I wonder how disappointed you are in me that I'm not able to do for you what you did for your own mother." Now, again for those of you had thinks that this is simple staff you haven't done it. And again, it's not one conversation-- I mean why do you think your mother said? You know, uhm, do you think her mother said, "Wow! I'm so impress and also so I feel so satisfied as a mother that you are defining yourself so clearly and setting clear limits in boundaries and that's really wonderful." You know, it doesn't work that way. And of course we not just our clients we all want to make a change and we wanna define ourselves more clearly and then we wanna applause for it. Well human systems don't work that way. So the real challenge is not the initial definition but the hanging in over a lot of time without becoming angry and defensive and keeping the conversation going. So, wa-- one of the mistakes I see therapist make is they make the error of suggesting or pushing a client to defined a limit or a boundary like, you know, just tell your son you're not give them many more, you know, you're enabling him or just tell your mother you can't do that without a really fall exploration of the client's personal beliefs about what is selfish and what is a reasonable claim to selfhood. What is our responsibility for other family members and our responsibility to be in charge and ensure the quality direction of our own life. And this will depend on the person's class their culture. Their sibling position. Their unique family history. How this particular issue has been manage over the generations etcetera. Uhm, so it's not so simple as, you know, just say no, just tell them, "no". Okay, next number five, is warm things up focus on the positive. You know, I began marriage rules with the chapter and warming things up and I, I was so ambi-- ambivalent about doing this, it seem so icky like the sort of things you read in women's magazines when you're waiting in the pediatricians or dentist office bout, you know, focus on the positive and, uhm, you know, that-- well, I'm not gonna off into my positive thinking like you that's a different, different invited address. But I actually did come to realize is that, uhm, it's essential, that's it's essential that we learn to speak to the positive and to warm things up in a relationship. And it's essential because no one, no one-- I don't care if the person is 8 years old or 88. No values criticism even if it's really constructive criticism. If there's not a surrounding climate of love and respect or at least respect, respect and in couples many folks welcome constructive criticism during early phase but they will tolerate it less well overtime. Especially if it's, you know, there's a lot of it like, like I tend to do. And, uhm, here's this card-- if you seen the greeting card that says something in front like, "If a man is alone and the forest with no women to criticize him as he's still a schmuck." No I have to point out, men always think this is hilarious some women have a very different reaction cuz some women have the reaction. If the poor guy is so beleaguered by criticism, you know, why doesn't like do what he suppose to do and do what he says it's gonna do etcetera. So, they're two sides here, uhm, but this, this is an important one warming things out and what so interesting about couples is that when couples first get together they automatically know how to make each other feel love and valued and especial and chosen. And they will automatically notice the positive and give voice to that. The longer and more enduring the relationship the more the selective attention totally flips. I mean it totally flips and the person will automatically notice and give voice to what they're critical about. And don't like-- and it can be a lot of little things like, "Why did you put so much water in the pasta pot?" And-- you know, "And that's not the right knife to cut a tomato." And, "Five bananas at the same level of ripeness with two of us in the house?" Like, "What's wrong with you?" So focusing on the positive you actually have to have the intention to do that. And, you know, oh, and I add something to this. I add-- and I say this in marriage rules that God is in the details meaning that just like when we criticize we criticize the specifics, you know, like you're 10 minutes late you didn't call. When you speak to the positive you need to speak to this specifics. Now we know this with kids like we know it intuitively it's not enough to say, "You're great kid. I love you. I love you, you're the best." You need to say, "You did a great job setting the table." Or "It was really brave of you to tell your friend that she hurt your feelings." So, for this one warming things up you need to speak to the specifics like, uhm, "You were just so funny at the party last night. Like you were just really funny. I love that about you." Now, you, you know, people will tell me, "Well, there's nothing positive, like there's no positive specific thing." I could say to my mother my husband." Well then I tell them they've lost prospective, you know, cuz there's always something. And or what I hear much more often is, "I'm not gonna do that until he, you know, the idiot does this. No way." We'll if you want a recipe for relationship failure wait for the other to change first. Okay, that's the recipe. So you probably know that, uhm, that Jon Gottman, you know, the motes sort of marital research has the five to one ration, a positive to negative comments as the divorce bust or interactions as the divorce busting recipe. And I would say in my clinical experience if your speaking to the details and you have it to the one ration with your mother or partner ex or whoever you're doing really fine. So, okay the next one is number six, is over calm your LDD, listening deficit disorder. I am really wanting to get this added to the DSM. I mean very seriously I actually I'm not a fan of the DSM but if I could right it myself I be a fan. We look very different. So overcoming your LDD-- I mean it's really dialing down your defensiveness and helping clients to do that. Defensiveness is automatic, it's universal, it's in the body where wired for it. It's also the arch enemy of listening and connection. Now, again it's easy to listen without defensiveness if we like what the other person is saying. They're saying how brilliant and wonderful we are we can listen. But if we are being criticize we automatically listen defensively. We automatically listen for the inaccuracies the exaggerations. The distortions which will inevitably be there so we listen. So we can correct those things, you know. Uhm, and we can learn to listen differently. We can listen only to understand and to listen only for the part that we agree with. And to apologize for that part first and to say, "Do I have this right? And is there more that you haven't told me?" Pure, uhm, whole hearted listening I believe is the greatest spiritual gift that we can give to any person. And we all know that how we talk and how we listen determines how relationships go but we are much more interested in the talking part. You know, in, in sort, of uhm, enlarging our, our talking skills more than our listening skills. And when I was into peak and when I was working in the Menninger Foundation my brilliant colleague and dear friend Marion Nestle who now has a private practice in Palo Alto. When we were colleagues together we did this workshops in the community, ah, for women called that Marion developed called talking straight and fighting fair. And women were breaking down the doors to get in to our workshop, so I decided that I would do a workshop on listening by myself. I probably like called it the power of listening or something. Well, I had to cancel it, three people register. Now that I think about it I probably made a marketing error. I probably should have called my propose workshop what seven, secret listening tricks that will make the universe give you everything you want. All right. Really. Uhm, but back then I didn't think about marketing, ah, actually back then in the Menninger Clinic, you know, if I were to hear two therapist in the hall way talking about marketing they would be really referring to what they were gonna buy for dinner at the, ah, grocery store. But speaking of marketing I have to, uhm,-- and speaking of listening of overcoming your LDD when marriage rules came out and there had been 10 years between marriage rules in my previous book The Dance of Fear I look a little vacation, uhm, from writing. So I was a bit of a dinosaur when marriage rules came out. And Brené Brown, you know Brené Brown? Has a couple of books on the New York Times less now daring greatly and to give some imperfection. So Brené, uhm, the nice person that she is sended me-- sent me so I could market marriage rules like about 10,000 bookmarks in the mail. She put a great cloth that she heard me say, uhm, on the back of the bookmark and the quote is, it's, ah,-- well rather I said not it said. "If we would only listen with the same passion that we feel about wanting to be heard. I mean when that be a different world if we would only listen? So what I am to do with this thousands of bookmarks with this great quote?" "I brought them f or you." So, you know, they're, they're maybe-- the books may run out but I think there's an bookmarks by the book table for everyone to have one, thanks to Brené. And what I, what I suggest to people to help them to listen is I suggest they think of two conversations and I invite you to try this it's very, very interesting to try. I call it The Two Step, you know, because people feel, we feel that we have to do everything in one conversation. Right? You have to say in one conversation. So in the first conversation you enter the conversation and slow down your breathing and pick a time when you can really listen and all you're gonna do in that conversation is listen and ask questions and make sure you have it right and to see if there's more that the other would like to tell you, and that is all. And you ask questions by the way, you know, you don't ask them like a legalistic fashion. If you're a lawyer don't act like one. You know, when our set of genuine interest-- and, you know, listening means no interruptions, no correcting fa-- facts or exaggerations. No looking at your iPhone no counter fun-- ah, punching. No, you know, bringing up you know, most of grievances, etcetera. Then in the next conversation this is like the two step, the next conversation you speak to the differences as in I thought about what you said, I am so sorry like I said, you know, yesterday that I ignored you at the party and that I do tend to ignore you at parties but I don't agree that I was responsible for your over drinking. You know, so that something we see differently. I feel I'm responsible for my behavior, uhm, but, but not for yours. And that's the difference. And these are equally important. The only listening part and then having the courage to define your differences, uhm, and I think the second part sometimes is very hard for men. You know, all of these business of women not being able to find their voice in my clinical experience for that question in marriage and in family of origin man have more difficulty finding their voice. So, you know, there's a joke among men-- it's actually-- I heard this joke first in Mexico and I think it's like cross cultural. But there's a joke among men that, uhm, that the men should always have the last word in every argument and always has the last word in every argument. And that last word is, "I'm so sorry, dear, I was wrong please forgive me, I'll never do it again." Because a lot of men are very conflict avoiding it and that's not good. So, think about these two parts that invite my clients to experiment. Okay. Number seven, ah, is-- this is actually two but I'll tell you why I put them together. So the last of The Magnificent Seven, is respect differences while defining a bottom line. You don't have to do this at the same time but, uhm, let's just look at respecting differences. Relati-- you, you know, we know that relationships require a profound respect for differences. We all see the world to more different filter through our age or culture generation or unique family history or sibling order everything. And differences don't mean one person is right and the other person is wrong but humans, you know, may have notice that Homo sapiens have a terrible problem with differences that we either deny a difference or glorify a difference or, uhm, hate the differences or want to eradicate a difference. And when I work with people, when I work with couples for example I always help them to lighten up about differences. I have a great cartoon in my consulting room done by my dear friend Jennifer Berman and the cartoon shows a dog in a bed-- a dog and a cat in bed together. A dog and a cat in bed. The dog is looking morose and reading a book called Dogs Who Love Too Much. The cat is saying, "I'm not distancing. I'm a cat, damn it!" Now I love this cartoon cuz you know we really do need to lighten up of our differences. The problem is and this gets to the bottom line part t hat sometimes people get so, uhm, they sort of overdue this business of differences like the Mars Venus stuff that they over do it so they really making excuses for their partner like, "He can't vacuum the rug. His penis would get in the way." You know. I exaggerate but just a little bit because, you know, it-- it-- it's hard to really reach for someone's confidence to do better and, and step up to the play. So along with respecting differences we need to be able to have a bottom line position. And a bottom line position is a challenge in every single relationship. It's a specially difficult in marriage or with the kid or you're living under the same roof with someone. Uhm, a bottom line position, let me define that, it's that place where your core deepest values and, uhm, priorities and beliefs are not negotiable under relationship pressures. It's not a threat or an ultimatum that you throw out it in angry time, nobody might do that. A bottom line position is in the body and it evolves from a deep, uhm, it's a deeply felt position of what you feel entitle to and the limits of what you can tolerate or accept. And there's no one right bottom line position for all couples or all relationships. When people don't have a bottom line position or they set the bar too low relationships will spiral downward. And a bottom line position can be about a very serious issue obviously, you know, it can be-- like I was working with the women and her husband, uhm, was a sex addict this was their language not mine. He was a sex addict and he was always having affairs in this and that and she was always reading up in a literature in sex addiction and going to work shops with him and being more and more depress and angry and etcetera, etcetera but he had this disease and so forth. And in, in the therapy she actually reach the very different place and it, it really was a bottom line place where she said to him-- and this was really different because it was-- you know in the bottom line what you say in your actions are can grew in. And she said to him something like, you know, we can call this a sex addiction. You can call it sex addict-- addiction or you can call it the sour crowd. But whatever you call it or we call it I can no longer live this way. And if there's one more affair whether emotional or online or, you know, in reality, I mean in life I don't care anymore if the problem is cause by testosterone or what your dad did to you or, you know, your neural circuits or the moon or stars or grace because the issue is I can't live with it anymore. And I also invited her to write in a card not email but to write it warmly cuz she really didn't wanna divorce. You know, because-- you know it's very interesting that in my experience men often feel they're being left by their wives out of the blue. The women feels I have said this a million time. I've told them a million times how unhappy I am and they're both right. But the problem her part of the problem is she's been complaining for so long that she hasn't really clarify the bottom line position early enough. Which I help my clients do like, "Look, you know, I'm about on seven on a divorce scale of seven to 10 and if this continues, you know, I don't think I can stay and feel good about me and you and the relationship." A bottom line position also can be about something and is about something just in the dailiness of living as in, "I can't continue this conversation. If you don't get out of your debate mode and if you talk to me in this brat tat-tat way. So, I'm your partner I'm here to talk to you about anything. Came back and approach me when you can approach me in a really respectful way and not like I'm, uhm, you know, some kind of jerk or your enemy." That's a bottom line, uhm, so it's not, you know, if you look at, you know, couples that are working well it's not like people or crossing their arms in front of their chest and speaking in eye language in defining their bottom lines about everything. Uhm, but, uhm, e-- and in fact, you know, I think in a good relationship there's usually one person who's very flexible and can let a lot of reactivity and stuff just sort to float by them and be very accommodating and so forth. But when it really matters they can be very firm and clear about what's not negotiable and that business can't continue as usual until things change. So you need both the flexibility, you need-- you need a lot of flex-- it sort of like stand like in oak bend like, ah, plate of grass or something like that, I said, there was this some, you know, those things on the kindergarten wall or third grade wall, some of them really made an impression on me and one was, uhm, something like the wind snaps the mighty oak but only bends the fragile blade of grass. It's true cuz flexibility trumps for your strength most of the time. So I say in a relationship you can be flexible whatever 84% of the time but then sometimes you have be like the oak. So in conclusion, uhm, I would say that what we call the self and we have so many selves that can evoke depending on whether where in an empowering growth fostering context or where in the context that, you know, doesn't, doesn't allow for that but the self is always a work in progress. And my friend mentor Dr. Jean Baker Miller I still miss her very much. She always reminded us that all growth occurs in relationships, all growth occurs in relationships and I always remind my clients and everyone that if you're in a relationship now, I don't care if you're planning to get out in a year or you think you should be a-- out of it. If you're in the relationship now you can use that relationship as a laboratory to experiment with bold ax of change. And, uhm, really, you know, I encourage my clients to be curious cuz I'm curious in sort of put on their anthropologist hat or their therapist hat. You know, and do that, do a little bit or for search doing something different. And of course the challenge is not just to be ourselves but to chose the self that you want to be. So through our words and the quality of our listening we can create a more accurate view of the self, the other person and the relationship between us. Like anything worth doing changing your patterned automatic in grained ways of moving with the difficult person it is a matter of motivation first, courage, good will a genuine wish for a better relationship and a willingness to practice, practice and practice. So thank you very much. Thank you so much.
