DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE LIVE: BOSTON SEAPORT WORLD TRADE CENTER Jon Kabat-Zinn, Ph.D. 

00:00:00
JON KABAT-ZINN So if you don't mind, let's, ah, let's actually get started and let's take a few moments to, uhm, just sit. In the aftermath of what we've, what we've heard this morning and, and also what we've felt. And so no matter what the context the invitation is really always the same. Can we be present as Leon was talking about? Can we actually drop in on ourselves and inhabit our bodies and our hearts, and our minds fully in, in this moment which we all know but never actually remember give much purchase to the-- the-- it's actually the only moment we ever get in which to be alive or to feel, or to learn, or to know, or to love, or to breath. So let's see if we can just drop in for a moment on the full dimensionality of actually just si-- simply being here again in the aftermath of what we have drunk in, in that exquisite presentation by Jenny and, and James. 

00:01:40
[sil.] 

00:01:50
JON KABAT-ZINN And I'm not gonna give you an instructions although they are and infinite set of possible instructions for the cultivation of mindfulness that, ah, simply rest in the-- in awareness of how it is right now in your, in your heart, how it is right now in your body. How it is right now in, in the mind which often speak about all this as being separate, even though we know there, there's actually no separation at all. 

00:02:55

00:04:05
JON KABAT-ZINN Maybe, you'll notice or, or strike you that in a very real way, appealable and embodied way. Uhm, if you're inhabiting the present moment, if we are inhabiting the present moment, there's a very real way in which we are outside of passage of time. It's always now and that now has a timeless quality to it. And you heard the, you heard James talked about, ah, used the word a number of times liberation and you maybe got the sense from the people, some of the people being interviewed that maybe they were in some sense freer in certain ways, after having had the experiences that they've had cultivating intimacy with their own minds and bodies in that Vipassanā retreat. Freer than they would have been a, you know, if they haven't been exposed to that and perhaps, freer than they'd ever been in their lives. This is a trauma conference after all and by the way, I won't actually, ah, pretend that there's an end to the meditation in the beginning of the talk because you're in the same spirit that, you know, it's always now. It's like whatever is unfolding is unfolding. And the real meditation when all was said and done whether were incarcerated in prison or incarcerated in our heads, in our ideas and opinions and attachments, and likes and dislikes and everything else, or aversions, ah, that, ah, the real practice is how we are in relationship to the actually of this, this moment and everything inwardly and outwardly that isn't part of this moment for us. The known and the not known, the seen and the not seen, cuz a lot of it, uhm, Jim was-- James was, ah, mentioning aversion and greed which are two of the three, you know, sort of big trio of a Buddhist, ah, meditation and philosophy, greed, aversion, and the third one is delusion. Okay, so when we're not busy wanting or pushing things away where are very often caught in delusion and there again, ah, it can be imprisoning, ah, unless we can make expand to hold it. 

00:07:05
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:07:05
JON KABAT-ZINN So this potential for, uhm, opening to the actuality of things is quite huge and I could forever about it or any of the other presenters but when you hear people speaking who have been through a certain kind of experience and they have just got to be in certain way the most unlikely people in the world, ah, to be able to articulate this-- through this and the kind of embodied way where, you know, they're not bullshiting. I mean, in prison like almost everything that goes on is bullshitting. I mean there's a coin of the realm. They're just well, one con game after another if work in the Massachusetts prisons or you go in an attempt to do anything on Massachusetts prison as we did for a number of years. They have to actually take a course called the art of the con because, ah, it's so easy to get caught and hold into a certain kind of reality that they're constructing continually in the sort of larger field that the prison and you can, you do some very, very stupid and crazy things if you do get caught in that way. Ah, but you can see that it just doesn't get any more authentic than that. It's where the power of that lies and that I was to thank to Jenny that, uhm, I love the title Dhamma Brothers and Dhamma is the Pali for dharma which is the Sanskrit so it's the same thing. What we're talking about, when we use it with dharma or Dhamma, ah, you know, means a lot of different things. It means the teachings of the Buddha which are actually quite vast but condensed down to a very small number of what they called noble truths and principles and so forth. And then, ah, it's also means of the way things are kind of like in the sa-- same way as the Dao. You know, it's like the natural lawfulness of the universe. Uhm, and, you know what, when you see it, you know, that kind of authenticity. So here we have people in hell, in hell coming from a place of other authenticity and you can tell because, you have, uhm, we all have, you know, a kind of meter for knowing when people are talking from their heads as opposed to speaking from an integrated place of being and from direct experience. Not something that they read in the book or made up as it comes from actually a very, very challenging laboratory, ah, and to just say for those of you don't have the background that Vipassanā, ah, you hear the word Vipassanā and you hear the mindfulness did the same thing. Ah, the prac-- Vipassanā in Pali in its transcript, it, it, it really means insight, okay. And what the, the, practice is that cultivate insight are known as mindfulness, ah, which the Buddha-- it's often spoken now as the heart of Buddhist meditation, the cultivation of mindfulness. And there are many, many different methods that had been taught to cultivate mindfulness to deal with those, uhm, the, the kind of levels of, ah, greed, pain-- ah, greed, ah, ah, aversion and, ah, delusion that are part impassable-- part in parcel with our daily life. It's not just people who end up in prison, all of us and if you have a work in the prison, you know very quickly, you feel very quickly that things have been the tiniest little bit different, you could be in there. You know different from them and that's a very, very humbling. Now this is trauma conference and, you know, as you probably know most of the people who are in prison have long trauma histories. It's not just they, you know, sort of did something bad at one moment. I mean that they have the, the huge proportion in people in prison are traumatized and often from early childhood, even sometimes in (inaudible ). So, ah, it's very, very appropriate that, that, ah, we have this, you know, workshop today at this trauma conference that's bringing together again all this different ways of kind of trying to understand what's really going on and ultimately, uhm, what makes us human. And you-- I could feel certainly watching the movie which I've seen before and watching, ah, this, ah, interviews that, ah, you know, I thought that it should be called Dharma Teachers. They are teaching the dharma. They are an incredible advocates for it. And then I'm talking about technique either. They're not saying, ah, you know, sort of breath in, breath out, let go, watch your mind, do what it's doing, and all I can-- they're just speaking their own-- out of their own experience directly. And what it looks like, what it feels like is wisdom and it's not like they got it from anything. The hard laboratory is like you try it sometime. Take-- go to a Vipassanā retreat, that kind of Vipassanā retreat cuz there are lots of different kinds of Vipassanā retreats but there's, ah, S. N. Goenka form from-- it came out of Burma, ah, U Ba Khin and, you know, that tradition, ah, and it's know really hard core. Ah, it's like a green berets, you know, the sort of delta force of, ah, meditation practice in the, you know, Theravada in southern Buddhist tradition, ah, is like that kind of virtue where there's just sitting with your mind and then walking. Sitting and walking all in silence for 10 days. Now, if you're that interested in mindfulness, if more people, you know, because mindfulness getting more and more popular so I-- you know, and the people wanted to do mindfulness and they wanna bring it into their therapy or they want to teach MBSR or whatever and, and then we also had people who wanna come and teach with us in the hospital when we're running our prison project back in the early '90s. And I used to say, "Okay, why don't you start out in the prison and if you come out alive then maybe you can teach in the hospital." Because again their bullshit detectors are on such high gain that if you're going in with all these great ideas about how are you gonna help them and you're gonna teach them this wonderful thing, you're gonna be metaphorically at least dead in about 15 seconds. You'll your cred completely and you'll be seen as an impostor. And a lot of time, that's exactly what we are. We're like a sort of, ah, really posturing instead of being real and especially when you're in a position where like I can help you because you are traumatized or you are this and I'm here to help and everything else and you're creating this horrific separation. And you heard one of these inmates saying, you know, the, the one who's speaking about his daughter. I end the level, the subtlety of insight that hi attachment to his daughter, he began to see was actually about him and not about her. He saw that in the laboratory of just sitting, no one gave-- wrote him, you know, gave him a lecture about him. It was an insight that, that, that whole story about his daughter and how he's living for her and everything else and he said it very clearly. It's all about me, me, me, I, I, I. And the Buddhist famous for having said that he taught for 45 years and all of his teachings he said could be encapsulated once and on the (inaudible ) wasn't joking. I like to actually sometimes, you know, offer that sentence and sort of suggest that maybe we just keep it in the forefront of our consciousness or even put a little, you know, in a wallet that we can take it out every once and a while and check, you know, this. And it is-- the sentences nothing is to be clung to, the, the verb to cling, nothing is to be clung to is I, me, or mine, the personal pronouns. So then the question comes up, okay, yeah, well, okay, ah, it's not really about me but if you don't have any kind of sense in self then, ah, that may not be such a helpful message. So how do you actually work with people who have no sense of self or completely traumatized and, and I think you, you, just so how. You treat them as, ah, as whole human beings and offer them something that's not actually putting anything into but drawing something forth out of them and that is root meaning of the word to educated. 

00:16:40
[sil.] 

00:16:45
JON KABAT-ZINN And I can't help thinking again because this is a trauma conference, uhm, you know, here were are in Boston and, you know, the last or the next to the last person who was, ah, harmed by the, ah, bombings at the Boston marathon was just released from one hospital to the Spaulding Rehab Hospital with a metal in his heart and one leg, ah, gone and the other bridled with metal and may have to also be amputated. And on-- in PR drive, then over here, you heard the nurses and, you know, the, the guy himself talking about this and his, his fiancé and mother of his 5-year-old boy. You know, this whole city has been traumatized by that event and it didn't have to actually to happen to you to lose, lose a leg or, or whatever, or a child but this sort of, you know, it's, it's a very close to home for us. And I think it's important for us to kind of remember that in a certain way, uhm, being human itself has its own elements of inescapable trauma. Sometimes it's big, sometimes it's small but there's a certain way in which-- and this was-- and one of the Buddhist main insight. Ah, one of the Buddhist insights was the, you know, the first of the Four Noble Truths is the, the truth, the actuality of dukkha that life, ah, involves huge amount of suffering. It's not correct to say life is suffering as people often say that but there-- it's more correct to put it there is suffering, how are we going to deal with it. In other words, how to be in relationship to and so that's really what mindfulness and that's what the whole, ah, Buddhist philosophy is all about is understanding the nature of suffering and the potential for liberation from suffering and then also, uhm, ah, understanding the nature of what we call mind. 

00:18:55
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE "The true value of a human being is determine primarily by the measure and sense in which he has attained liberation from the self." Albert Einstein Ideas and Opinions, 1954 LIVE: BOSTON SEAPORT WORLD TRADE CENTER 

00:18:55
JON KABAT-ZINN And so it's perfect that neuroscience, ah, and, and that might point out very unusual that, uhm, you'd have a presentation like this with, ah, you know, uhm, a neuroscientist who is obviously also a meditation practitioner. This is not something that was happening, ah, 30 years ago. So let me see if I can get the slides now. So, and because there's a workshop really is also about the neurobiology itself and, and people gonna be talking about this a much more detailed this afternoon and I apologize in the events not being able to be here this afternoon because I would be the most enthusiastic person to actually stay for the afternoon if I could. But Einstein, ah, said, ah, "The true value of a human being is determine primarily by the measure and sense in which he has attained liberation from the self." So here's the question like, ah, is there a self, isn't there a self, ah, do we need a self in order to get rid, get rid of the self? Does this mean we need to get rid of the self? Is that what talking about or is it an illusion to begin with? And, ah, and I think we've already seen the proof that, ah, as I said that, uhm, people who have had deep trauma experiences can connect with this kind of approach. If it is skillful, if it is the correct fra-- ah, done in the correct way with the correct framework for the particular circumstances that you're in. And as I was saying, I mean, not everybody on the outside of the prison would be capable of sitting with their own mind for 10 days without going crazy. You say and you think I wanna watch my mind for 10 days. I mean, someone once said, ah, "My mind is like, you know, it's a dangerous neighborhood. I tried to never go there alone." But when you're sitting Vipassanā, when you called that any mindfulness, you're, you're-- they're alone only not because, you're there with the teachers and you're there with all the other people who have said yes to doing this insanely crazy thing that from the outside is the one pick then they say, "They're doing nothing. They're doing absolutely nothing hours and hours and hours every day." And I like to say, you know, Shakespeare wrote a play called Much Ado About Nothing and, you know, you could think all this, talk about mindfulness is much to do about nothing. But I like to say, "Well, it's not quite that. It much to do about what looks from the outside to be almost nothing but turns out to be just about everything." And whether we're dealing with trauma or whether we're dealing with medical conditions of one kind or another we-- whether we're dealing with, ah, you know, with stress, ah, the, the invitation is the same and that is to connect in the deepest of ways with the full dimensionality of who you are-- who we were already are without prejudicing by thinking you're not like, you know if I say who are you? First thing you're going to do is come up with your name come on. That's not who you are. So we start peeling back the layers of the onion while it gets really interesting like, you know, to just ne-- the questioning is much more important than the answers. Like, you know, so you could discard all the answers that come up in your mind, ah, not this, not this, not this, not this. Ah, not I, this is not I, that is not I, that is not I and what is I? What is that personal pronoun? 

00:22:40
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:22:40
JON KABAT-ZINN And what does it pointing to? And, you know, the beauty of this is you can feel it, you can see it. When it's embodied, it's just being human. I say just but it-- that's our inheritance and, and when we're talking about healing, my working definition of healing is coming to terms with things as they are. So you work with people where they are and as they are and then you, yourself, if you don't make yourself different from the other while you're the traumatized one, I'm not, can, can you feel the, the trauma in that, in that denial? It takes some kind of aversion there. Then, actually you're creating conditions to bring out what's keep us the most beautiful in virtually any in every human being to whatever extent it might be possible and it's not your work to do. It's-- you're creating an environment like any flowers by itself. And those environments have to be calibrated and this is one that kind of 10 day intensive Vipassanā retreat as one and, and I, I just was thinking and so as watching the movie that, ah, quite an amazing I think that it, it, it had such a profound impact as that, they were already imprisoned. And a Vipassanā retreat from the outside we might go to-- has a retreat, oh, my god, I'm in prison. I can't leave. They have all these rules. I can't do this, I can't do that but they were already imprisoned. And there was a lot of talk about, ah, by Jenny about moving across that threshold into a new space where things are all the same. It's this kind of gym it's still, ah, you know, behind four locked door and then one more but actually, a total shift the kind of like a metaphorical threshold is crossed not just the literal threshold. And the teachers are actually honoring you and they're serving food, and they're folding your laundry and they seem to care, and then, there's nothing to only watch your own mind. And then when, you know, you run into difficulty, they are here with you. Again, in some sense no separation. 

00:25:00
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:25:05
JON KABAT-ZINN So what we're talking about here is really, ah, historically and amazing thing. Ah, the presentation, the early presentation this morning is in some sense a convergence of science and dharma. And it has never happen before on the planet and it's really, ah, a tremendous opportunity to, ah, investigate the nature of the human mind, the nature of suffering, and the potential for profound, profound liberation, not banded little bit of therapy or, you know, getting a little bit sort of more well, adjusted but we're talking about the profound rotation in consciousness, waking up awareness. Cultivating this deep into you're re-- resource that we have always had which we call awareness that we never bring any awareness to and totally take for granted and get no training or schooling in. We have plenty of schooling in thinking and we get plenty of schooling in emotional reactivity. And practice makes perfect as you know, so the more we get into that the better we get at it but very little schooling in just resting in awareness in being present, in being open and then beginning to see that those sensations, those thoughts, those feelings, the deep anguish, the grief, the, the trauma inside the body that that's not you either. And that when the, the awareness is more like than any of that. But in order to even taste that, you have to investigate in that kind of laboratory that sometimes is very hard to arranged in your life so that you can taste that. Even though ultimately the laboratory is portable and it re-- as I'm saying it's e-- it's your whole life, it's every moment so it's not like, oh, I can't go on retreat, so I can't meditate. No, I mean, meditate-- meditation is moment by moment by moment. 

00:27:15
[sil.] 

00:27:20
JON KABAT-ZINN So this is in some sense, ah, we have contemplative wisdom are coming together with the scientific methodology for the first time and the potential riches here are gigantic if the contemplative and the scientific really can understand each other and not just pretend to understand each other while really not listening. And where we're-- we can really privilege the scientific as opposed to the, the, the, ah, contemplative. Now, this is something that is kinda like, ah, most beneficial when both are integrated and now more and more-- 10 years ago, if a neuroscientist, young neuroscientist, a graduate student told their advisor that, ah, they wanted to go into mindfulness or contemplative practice and look at the neuroscience so that they would be told, ah, aside from being laughed at, they'd be told that, that would be a, ah, a career ending move. Now, it's actually a smart career move. It's transformed enormously in the past 10 years. So I mention the Four Noble Truths. There are many, many different formulations of every aspect of the Buddhist teachings but the most fundamental one, the Four Noble Truths or the four ennobling truths, ah, actually framed in medical perspective. I said diagnosis, the diagnosis of the-- it is dukkha, stress, suffering, anguish, disease, there-- there's no good word for dukkha and you can put trauma in their too. And in fact, Mark Epstein is coming out with the book on, you know, trauma, ah, it's ca-- I think it's called trauma and it's, it's about the dukkha, the four-- the first noble truths. Then, he is saying, there's an ideology, there's a cause for dukkha, source of it, the origin of it and, ah, we heard talked of it in the movies, it's craving to diction. It's attachment and it's self identifying width. I want that the problem is not the one thing much of time. The problems, the odd, that doesn't know itself and thinks it want something then you get it, then you want the next thing cuz that's not satisfying. And that's a kind of hedonic treadmill you can run on for your entire life and have no idea who you actually are in the first place. And then the prognosis is a very good prognosis that, you know, there is possible to actually deliberated from this. And if you show that movie to people who are in deep despair, I think they would be very, ah, impressed and, ah, heartened because very often as we see this all the time in mindfulness based stress reduction in the classes in the hospital, we have 30 people in the room all meditating together and people share their stories at least a little bit of why they are there and, and, months, if you fulfill that, I'm glad I don't have what that person has, you know. So in, in some sense by listening to the levels of dukkha and the kinds of suffering that other people experiencing and how many different infinite number of ways throughout a human beings that suffer, then all of a sudden, you begin to think, ah, maybe I'm okay with my kind of suffering, you know, and maybe, that's workable, maybe it's, maybe we can actually work with that. And then the treatment plan, ah, Four Noble Truth, is the, ah, what's called the eightfold noble path. Ah, mindfulness is one of those eight path factors. 

00:30:50
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:30:50
JON KABAT-ZINN And the beauty of, uhm, the eight-- the eightfold path is that, it's, ah, it's a hologram so everyone of the path factors is enfolded into every other one and, ah, so very often when I used the word mindfulness and I'm not using it as a kind of, ah, to mean the way we are cultivating attention and meaning it as a placeholder for the entire dharma. And again pointing towards that confluence of science and dharma and not wanting that get eclipsed or lost because if it does and it's very high risk that it can happen when people think to understand what mindfulness is and then start applying it with-- without practicing themselves. So if you take home no other message than this is that if you really wanna understand what you saw on that movie, you have to, you have to go into the laboratory and sit with yourself. Actual-- the laboratory is yourself so you don't necessarily have to go on, ah,10 day Goenka Vipassanā retreat although high recommended. I've done it a number of times and hugely, hugely valuable. But you can just wake up and sit in you-- in the morning, in your house. Sit with you mind and you said well, I love to but I don't have enough time. I got to, you know, get the kids to school and make breakfast and everything else. You can just get up an hour earlier. I can't do that, I got-- I need my sleep. Well, okay, there's one attachment you could look at. And I'm kidding partly, but it depends on well, how much you care, I-- I'll have my liberation later. Next lifetime, I'm already too stress to deal with like now I have to meditate, too. No, I'd rather just get my patience to meditate. That is a disastrous mind state mental attitude, disastrous. And I'm being deadly serious about it. That is the way the field could die and, you know, and we're really good at killing things before we understand what they are. And the dharma, there's nothing deeper on the planet. This is not just some kind of quaint cultural, you know, sort of thing. It's not a thing. It's a way of understanding what it means to be human and we should not denature it in out of ignorance, out of delusion or out of greed which is very often what drives our science or our therapy, or aversion so that-- and without awareness. So, of course, we're all gonna be driven by greed, hatred, and delusion but if we bring awareness to it and, you know, improve your science, you know, improve your therapy, the awareness, you don't have to fix anything. It's not about fixing. My working definition of healing is coming to terms with things as they are as I said. Okay, easy to say but I, I'd be happy to come to terms with things but not just as they are because, I don't like them like this. Okay, a great place to start. Okay, so Nyanaponika Thera in, ah, in-- who was actually a German but he has a Sri Lankan name because, ah, he lived in Sri Lanka as a Buddhist monk for and virtually, has hold a double life, wrote a book way back in the '60s called the Heart of Buddhist Meditation. He said, "Mindfulness is the unfailing master key for knowing the mind and is thus the starting point. It's the perfect tool for shaping the mind and is thus the focal point and the lofty manifestation of the achieved freedom of the mind, and is thus the culminating point." So that's interesting isn't it? It's the beginning, it's the middle, and it's the end. So this is none dual formulation of mindfulness. Okay, about getting anywhere else. This is very, very hard for us who live outside of prison. If your imprisoned, you're there for life. You know, you're not gonna get anywhere else, okay. But here, we have the illusion that, oh, I'm on the way to some better moment when it will all come together for me. I get promoted or I get married, or I'll have children, or the children go to college or whatever it is and it's always about the future. And it, and it's always and all of our education about acquiring, learning to get somewhere else, to make something of yourself or with, ah, and this is radical, radical thing. You know, you're already okay. You're already okay even if your own murder and there are many stories in the Buddhist literature about Buddha relating to, you know, even mass murders. So this is radical in the sense that there's no place to go and nothing to do and nothing to attain. That's the great teaching, the none dual teaching or the Heart Sūtra and the Mahayana as end tradition. But that's it, that's, I mean, that's the core of mindfulness. It's not about getting anywhere else. It's about being where actually are and waking up to it. Waking up to it. It's about awakening and that sounds a mystical thing that you have to be enlightened and you don't what that is. 

00:36:05
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:36:05
JON KABAT-ZINN But you want it now and you'll just try to be enlightened your whole life, always getting on to wi-- what, what it will take to be enlightened. Now, what if you're already enlightened or enlightened enough to actually just wake up to who you are moment by moment by moment because it's only moment. So that's a practice, that's like, you know, that's like exercising a muscle. You can practice that. Breath goes in, breath goes in, breath goes out, breath goes in, breath goes out. You can feel it. Now, think about it but feel it and already, you're in the present moment. And you don't have to take it personally, it's not you breathing. You can make a big story about your breathing but it was up to you to be breathing, you would've died a long time ago, whoops, forgot. You got distracted, you know, you got a call, forgot to breath. So I'll just recommend a book that just came out that was a journal, issue of a journal called Contemporary Buddhism that Mark Williams and I, who neither of whom are Buddhist, co-edited, uhm, and, ah, it's a tremendous resource, there are papers in there that are actual masterpieces on this confluence of dharma and science. And from a lot of different perspectives, a lot of different, ah, Buddhist, ah, scholars and so forth writing about different traditions within the Buddhist dharma framework and then in conversation with scientist about mindfulness and whatever you can measure it and what it is and so forth and, ah, and so that's just a resource for, you know, again not staying on the surface in terms of this whole subject and, and you probably all know this but there is-- has been a kind of, ah, an explosion of interest and mindfulness over the past 10 years or so, ah, and ah, and it's going exponential and it's tremendous opportunity but this is also tremendous, you know, dangerous associated with this if people are not actually practicing because and it will very easily becomes cerebral and conceptual and, ah, lose the transformative essence that you felt in the films. And it's cannot be done mechanically. That's not, you know, that's, that's unskillful teaching. Ah, and all of what's really essential can be lost. And, and there's this mindfulness research monthly just this so, you know, as a resource that you could, actually, get online, it's free and it will tell you what's happening it the whole field and then there's this journal Mindfulness as well. 

00:39:05
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:39:05
JON KABAT-ZINN And just to say, I mean, in terms at the work that we do at UMass medical center, it's, it's spread around the world and there are something like 740 programs that we know about all around the world. So I just wanna say a few things, uhm, about, ah, MBSR and this whole question of the self. Ah, in 2007, Norman Farb and Zindel Segal and a bunch of other people at the University of Toronto, ah, published this paper, ah, and I love the title of it. Attending to the present mindfulness meditation reveals distinct neural modes of self-reference. 

00:39:50
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:39:50
JON KABAT-ZINN Since psychology is really all about the study of the self, ah, isn't it wonderful that we're now able to actually do research and write papers that are, ah, drilling down into the whole question of what do we, what do we actually mean when we speak of the self. And being able to look at it from the perspective of third person by putting people in FMRI scanners and, ah, looking at what they're brains are doing as well as, ah, first person, what they're actually reporting they are doing, uhm, or experiencing and just to say that, ah, you probably all notice that, ah, uhm, what they found as you know, if you put someone in the scanner, and, ah, and you say well, just lie there. Just don't do anything, ah, that a whole region of the brain starts to get more active. It use more oxygen and, and, and that's called the, the default network and it's this medial, ah, ah, medial, ah, network in the, in the, ah, cerebral cortex. Uhm, and, and it-- it's also, also called the narrative network because when you ask someone to just lie in the scanner do nothing, ah, what the mind immediately defaults to is narrative and very often, not just narrative but narrative about your favorite subject and what might that be? 

00:41:20
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:41:20
JON KABAT-ZINN Me, the personal pronouns of course. So the rest of my day, what I have to do, my to do list, my shopping list, or I mean, you know, what happen yesterday or what I have to do tomorrow or whatever. But it's all really about me, a lot of it. So they call that a narrative, midline network, ah, and it overlaps with the default network. This stuff is still being worked out and there changes if you know the work of Giuseppe Pagnoni, ah, who was at the Emory for seven or 8 years and is now in Modena in, ah, in Italy. Ah, actually it's studying the, ah, the default network with meditators, ah, in looking at changes in, in that. So there's a huge amount of work going on. Many of you know more about than I but what they found was that when they look to people who had been going through MBSR, mindfulness based stress reduction which is not the 10 day Vipassanā retreat. But it's a different door into the same room, knowing nearest intents, ah, laboratory experience and of course, you're not lock up metaphorically in the 10 day retreat under those kinds of severe constraints. 

00:42:30
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:42:30
JON KABAT-ZINN But still, you're doing the similar kind of practice, you're attending moment to moment to the unfolding experience of life, ah, both in formal meditation practice, 45 minutes a day, 6 days a week at least, and then, ah, in informal meditation which is kind of like daily life as much as you can manage it. And what they find is that the MBSR people compared to, ah, weightless controlled group, they, uhm, showed, ah, a reduction in the, ah, midline, ah, narrative network activity and the lighting up of another network more laterally and that involve the insular and this take hold the experiential network. And, and this is all done by, ah, sort of testing people like, ah, or as saying them on adjectives and how se-- and how self-describe in terms of adjectives. And what they found was that, ah, after MBSR training, ah, there's more activity in this lateral network and that has more to do with just the present moment, no story. Just I'm here but I'm here and I don't need to sort of say anything about. I feel the breath. I feel sensations in the body, same things that Vipassanā focuses on, breath and body. And by the way, the Buddhist teachings, ah, they-- in the teachings of mindfulness their four foundations of mindfulness, guess what the first one is, it's the body. Okay, that was not an accident while the Buddha just, you know, he had a bunch of things. Let's put one first. What should we put first? I don't know, let's just do the body. You know, no, the first foundation of mindfulness is the body for a reason because this is, this is what we are. It's a mystery. We don't-- and to get how there is this, there is a body and then there is me, you know. My body, I possessed it, I owned it. So there's a huge mystery there. So, uhm, not only does this area light up more in the MBSR group but there, they are uncoupled so they are not as tightly linked as they, ah, are in the controlled group and that means that there's nothing wrong with this narrative network by the way. We would never be able to get through life with out, ah, narrative self-referencing. But when we are attached to it then we will self-identify with the stories that we generate, we're in trouble. Why, because those stories, if you start to what's on your mind which is a very humbling experience to do. How many of you have a regular meditation practice? Just so that I have a sense of it. Well, that's very impressive. It's looks like it's, ah, maybe 40%. 

00:45:25
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:45:25
JON KABAT-ZINN So when you start to pay attention to your own mind, it's like really, uhm, shocking what can come up. Ah, oh, you're in there, too? Yeah, it's like, you know, which is unbelievable. Ah, and the-- but mindfulness is really about nonjudgmental awareness, okay. So it's like the awareness that arises, this is my working operational definition, the awareness that arises from paying attention on purpose in the present moment nonjudgmentally. That means kindness, that means self-compassion, that means generosity. It all comes out to that nonjudgmental, okay. And we can emphasize one aspect over the-- or another but it's really awareness and as I said, you already have it. So there's nothing that you have to acquire but maybe what you don't have so much, what none of us have so much is free access to awareness because it always obscured by our narratives by I'm gonna thinking about this, that, and the other, the future, the past, what I likes, I dislikes, and we can get completely caught up in that stuff with no awareness. And we think that's the reality, that's actually delusion. That's delusion. And so this is a very kind of kind and generous invitation to reclaim the actuality of your life while you have the chance. And you only have the chance while the breath is moving in and out through this nostrils of ours. Okay, and you think, well, okay, but I'm busy now, I'll do it later. And sooner or later, there will not be a later and you don't know. You could just be, let's say, going to see the end of the Boston marathon. You don't know. 

00:47:10
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE Implication for what we call The Self: You may have far too "small" a view of yourself (dimensionally reduced, inaccurate, ego-centric, rigid) 

00:47:15
JON KABAT-ZINN So I think that's one of the most important papers to come out in a very, very long time and, ah, developing it more, ah, of course, to feel this expanding around this kinds of things. And you're gonna hear a lot more about at this afternoon. So raise your hands up high, if I'm gonna wind down now Bessel just so to give heads up. Raise your hands up high if you see a triangle in this figure. I wanna s-- feel-- so everybody is raising their hand up high which is really interesting because there's no triangle in that figure as you all know probably. But the brain doesn't have any problem with that or whatsoever. It-- you know, it's all defined by, ah, ah, figure the plain that has three sides but you see there are no three sides here. There's just empty space. 

00:48:00
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:48:00
JON KABAT-ZINN And if I rotated this little pacman, one of them just the tiniest little bit, the illusion of the triangle would go away, okay. But the brain doesn't have any problem at all seeing something that's not, ah, here. And how many of you seen the gorilla video which I'm not gonna show but, ah, yeah, they seen the gorilla video. So the brain also has no problem not seeing things that are completely in front of your eyes like a gorilla banging his chest but, if you set it up correctly, you won't see it. And you'll swear that I switch movies on you. So the brain does a lot of very interesting things. It can see what's not here and it cannot see what is here, that's really unreliable. Maybe we need to exercise that brain, you know, that's most complex collection of matter in the known as universum in 10 billion, you know, neurons although I don't know who counted them. Ah, and you know that hundred trillion synapses and this brain is in organ plasticity. 

00:49:00
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:49:00
JON KABAT-ZINN I mean it's an organ of experience continually reshaping itself and, ah, reconfiguring the real estate's so to speak, ah, to as a, you know, the consequence and experience, and a traumatic experience can have very, ah, sort of serious consequences on the, ah, robustness of the actual brain tissue itself but here are to because of the plasticity, there's tremendous potential for healing for actually reconfiguring the brain to, ah, move beyond the kind of wells of, ah, disconnect that it can get into that then manifest, you know, down to the tissue level, down to the start le-- level, down to the neuronal level, maybe down to the synaptic level. Okay, and those are kind of energy states that is possible for us to in some sense begin to reconfigure and in MBSR, I won't show you the slides but Britta Hölzel and Sara Lazar at Mass General than showing that and originally, I think Britta was supposed to come and participate this afternoon showing that after 8 weeks of MBSR, you see, ah, major thickening in a bunch of different regions of the brain like the hippocampus which is involved in, you know, sort of learning in memory and, ah, and the cerebellum and, and, ah, also it's a, you know, places and then also you see a thinning of the amygdala. So all of this circuits that were pointed out, they-- 8 weeks they change and now there are some mindfulness studies coming out to show, sometimes they can change in number of, in a matter of minutes or, you know, just 20 minutes of practice, or 20 minutes three times or something like that. 

00:50:50
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:50:50
JON KABAT-ZINN So, anyway, the reason I'm showing this triangle is because I think that we might do well to think of the self as a little bit like this. When we talk about myself or the self, like in a sense, we're just kinda creating an illusion, okay, that whoever you think you are, that's not who you are. And whatever your narrative is, whatever your narrative is, even if it's a trauma narrative, a tale of drama narrative that it's not actually true. It's just a kind of habit. It's a, it's a energy configuration that we fallen into for whatever reasons, ah, and we have the potential to actually recognized that our narr-- we are much bigger than our narrative. We are much, much, larger than our narrative. In fact, there are multiple dimensions of being that, ah, we can tap into and that you do when you, ah, enter into that laboratory that I've been speaking about. And then you realized, make real for yourself that who you thought you are has nothing to do with who you are and even how you round up in prison has nothing to do with now. And so there's the potential for real transformation and I think you used that word transformation and, and I, I think it should not be used lightly. It is really potentially, profoundly transformative and so maybe we should begin to think of the self more as what, what's called in chaos theory stranger tech-- attractor. You know, that the you that woke up today is probably not exactly the same as the you that woke up, ah, yesterday, that we're kind of approximation of the same person and, you know, if you look in the mirror, you know, yep that's me, all right. Ah, but you're not exactly who you were yesterday. And you know more or less, or whatever, I mean, we're continually changing. 

00:52:45
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:52:45
JON KABAT-ZINN And that's what this is and, ah, and so, this is, this is actually an emotion. It's pattern that's continually changing and is never exactly the same but always self-approximates, ah, in that way and maybe this would be a better metaphor so to speak for who we are. And that this is a kind of an energy well that you can stay in, stuck in, in a certain way but then a, a certain kind of therapy or a certain kind of experience or a certain kind of connection happens, the certain kind of invitation to sit a 10-day Vipassanā retreat, watch your mind and sit through your hurting knees and your aching back and your mind that you, you know, and all this trauma, memories, that come up and everything else and you just allow yourself to be the awareness that is bigger than all of that can hold it. Even for tiny little moments not like, oh, I have to do this for hours but just this moment. The energy of that can actually catapult to into a new dynamical framework, a new dynamical framework that has more room that has more spacious, that allows you to be in your own body and say not go with violence and aggression in the prison as you heard but actually go with gentleness and kindness and yet not be any more vulnerable, okay, in the most hostile environment on earth. Uh-hmm, and that requires a certain kind of embodiment in a, in a, in an environment that's unbelievably aggressive and hostile and yet, you are going with something that touch you in the deep way but you're not losing your power. In fact, you're gaining infinitely more power and kindness always has more power than, that kinda sort of feigned toughness even if it murderous-- even if it's murderous. 

00:54:45
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:54:45
JON KABAT-ZINN And so, I think if we start thinking of the self in this kind of way that it's very fungible, that it's continually changing and that our experience can actually catapulted from one kind of energy well to another, that then we can develop therapies that really respect the people that we are working with. Where they actually are and we understand that it's not about making them better in the sense that they're not good enough now that their experience now is coherent. It's, it's who-- it's, it's, it's, it is true as it can be. It's just not true enough that the narrative whatever it is about the past or about inadequacy, or about how much of my brain is degraded, or how much brain fog I'm in or other, it's all true. It's just not true enough. There are other dimensions that-- of our being that when touch actually are integrative that can bring all sorts of things together. They can actually generate neuro-- neurogenesis, they can stimulate neurogenesis. They can stimulate, ah, ah, synaptic connections that can drive new connections in the brain, uhm, new patterns in the brain. 

00:56:00
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE "A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such attainment is in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security." Albert Einstein DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:56:05
JON KABAT-ZINN So I'll end by quoting one of my favorite quotes from Albert Einstein, uhm, "A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space." I love that Einstein brings the human being and the universe together. You know, because I mean he spent his whole life trying to unify and did unify mass and energy and time and space and here, he is bringing us into the frame, ah, a part limited in time and space. "He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest." And then he says, "A kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison," as that inmate did who saw through his attachment to his daughter and how he was using that to actually not love his daughter, ah, "by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty." Embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty, widening our circle of compassion. "Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such attainment is in itself a part of the," and here, he uses the word liberation, "and a foundation for inner security." 

00:57:30
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:57:35
JON KABAT-ZINN So I think in this, ah, confluence, uhm, one of my patients actually made this for me because at the end of the retreats that we do, at the end of the retreats that we do for health professionals, uhm, you know, it's the last day and I won't often say something like this because like okay, the retreats are over now stop sitting, you know, I've, I've had so much. I think, I'll just give myself a break and started in a Monday or something like that. And he say, "No." If this is about life and death, if this is about who we really are, if this is as deep as it gets in terms of what it means to be human then it needs to be nurtured in a way that's not about one more should. Now, I have to meditate on top of everything else but just kinda keeping in mind that nurturing ourselves and reconnecting with ourselves in this way, really important. 

00:58:25
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:58:25
JON KABAT-ZINN So, uhm, I'll leave you with that. Thank you. 

00:58:35
UNKNOWN If you imagine that some, some of the, ah, students and present retreats need our help and support during the, during the meditation. If you describe more about examples or what that was like. 

00:58:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, we, I don't know if this, this is on? Yeah, uhm, you said a little bit about a guy that I, the only thing I said about him was as a very, very violent man. His name was Wayne, uhm, and, ah, he had just to make this very brief-- but he had, had to do something-- he, he had been very violent and he's like but one of the worst things he had done was he had to kill his very best friend. And he-- when he reached prison, he was unable to set and contain himself. When he was ripping through the prison, a lot of gang violence, uhm, when he came into Vipassanā course, he was unable to sit and he would get up and wander around do slightly bizarre things and he was confronted on day six by the teacher who said, "You have two choices, you can leave right now or you can sit and you can really look at, you know, what it is you're , you're dealing with." And he process for the first time, ah, the feelings attached to the murder of his friend and all the aftermath of that and, uhm, when he had a meeting with the teacher and said, "Do you know, what he'd done?" And the teacher said, "That's, that's good. That's exactly what you need to do. You're doing the right thing." That kind of support was often necessary when this-- that went through storms of emotions previously unavailable memories came for them and they needed to know that what they are doing was the right thing, that they were actually sitting with that stuff. So a lot of reassurance, a lot of counseling that went and the teachers were always available, ah, 24/7 to have private meetings with these men as, as things came after them. 

01:00:30
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Was there any touch, any physical contact with the people? 

01:00:35
UNKNOWN No phy-- physical touch. 

01:00:35
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Not at all. 

01:00:35
UNKNOWN No, no hugging or yeah. 

01:00:40
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Okay. 

01:00:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:00:50
UNKNOWN There was always talk that, uhm, that there was gonna be a, ah, group of, of COs that we're gonna go and sit Vipassanā. And there's actually a Vipassanā at the center not far away, I don't know if that's happened since, since it came to Donaldson. Uhm, there's a deep respect for almost a reverence for Vipassanā. Everybody in the prison knows what is to have some funny ways pronouncing a word, uhm, but they all have a sense of what it means. I, I would like-- you know, one of the sad things for me is I would like to see more support for the guy that have sit Vipassanā, ongoing support. 

01:01:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:01:30
UNKNOWN It's hard for them to find space to get together and, uhm, I'd like to see a library set up for them with a lot of good books to read, uhm, and that's not really happening and I don't think the staff is being encourage. 

01:01:40
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Weren't they broke enough at some point? 

01:01:45
UNKNOWN What? 

01:01:45
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Weren't they broke enough at some point? 

01:01:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, if any of you see the film, you'll see that it was shut down for 4 years which was it happened very suddenly and it was somebody making a call to the commissioner and, and the prog-- the program was shut down. And the men were actually forbidden to meet or meditate and so they were secretly meditating and for them to get replenish. 

01:02:05
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Good. So how did that has come-- and has come to them because that's where the movies sort of ends - 

01:02:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:02:10
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK - and it was very tragic note. 

01:02:10
UNKNOWN Well, no, no, the movie goes on, uhm, yeah, I don't know why people often say that. I've heard that so many. The movie goes on because it comes back again. And, ah, one of the last scene is, ah, the teacher is walking back and, and there the man are lining the whole way. They stand there respectfully because in prison you have to, you can't move without being told so stand there with big smiles and some of them are crying and there are the teachers and one of the teacher says, you know, uhm, we-- everybody else wants to get out of Donaldson, we're the only guys that wanted to come back in here. 

01:02:45
UNKNOWN There was a change of staff, right? The chaplain and ah, the warden. 

01:02:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

01:02:50
UNKNOWN That's where (inaudible ) would come back. 

01:02:55
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

01:02:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, Dr. Cavanaugh, the director of treatment went back to warden and a new warden, and said, you know, "This, this used to go on. I think it would good." He always, Dr. Cavanaugh smart to do such treatment that's all it is, he just use treatment. So we came back in and again. 

01:03:10
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Go ahead, yeah. 

01:03:10
UNKNOWN Uhm, I would ask Dr. Kabat-Zinn what is the difference with the S. N. Goenka and the (inaudible ). So I was wondering what's the difference? 

01:03:30
JON KABAT-ZINN Well, it had mention in the presentation. The Goenka, ah, approach is to do, uhm, 3 days of what's called Anapanasati in the Buddhist tradition which is awareness of the breath that they are focusing, ah, on here, the, the, at the upper lip, you know, below the nostrils. So that's your assignment, okay, 3 days of that. Now, you probably can't do 2 minutes of it without the mind wondering, so there's one more instructions that is when the mind wonders, no matter what it goes to just bring it back to the breath. Okay, now, ah, I don't know, I think they treated as distraction. When we give that breath instruction, we say nothing is a distraction when-- because it's not about the breath. It's about the awareness. And if we hope to really utilize, ah, meditation for healing then, what's on your mind is important to notice. So the instruction that we use is notice what carried you away from the breath or what-- downstream from that when you realize you're not on the breath anymore. Just taking note of it, don't pushes it away, don't perseverate with it, just let it be and come back to the breath. So they do that for 3 days, 12, 14 hours a day, is that correct? And then 10, you know, that's really hard and then after that, they shift to what we, we call sweeping in that tradition or body scanning. So-- and they usually start from the top of the head and it's almost like you, you're doing, ah, ah, a brain scan on yourself only a full body scan where, you know, you bring awareness in a narrow band right through the entire body and you can do it very slowly and when you go out the other end, you just come back and you just scanning, scanning, scanning, and then again, sensations in the body is a primary object of attention but, of course, thoughts will come up, emotions will come up, ah, past will come up, future will come up, all sorts-- it's comes up, and you just treat in this tradition. You treat is as that's fine, back to where I am in the body and you do that, over and over. Now you can see mind goes off, you bring it back, mind goes of you bring it back, mind goes off, you bring it back. The first thing you're gonna wind up doing is think this is the boringest, stupidest thing I've ever done in my life. I mean it's like, okay, I get the point. Now show me something interesting that, too. Goes off, bring it back, goes up bring it back to wherever you are in the scan and it's, ah, transformative, ah, because your cultivating a combination of, ah, one-pointed attention but also moving attention so that's kind of like a flexibility of attention and mindfulness and it's all done with affection, with, ah, self compassion, with kindness, ah, with, ah, a sense of, ah, you know, open hearted spaciousness so to speak. And over time it has its, has its effects. 

01:06:50
UNKNOWN Jon and I both eager to say something. Can you say something because it fit in so well with like you say . You and I have talked to the past as I used to send quite a few my patient to MBSR program and they didn't make it. 

01:07:05
JON KABAT-ZINN They didn't get.. 

01:07:05
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK They were too traumatized and, uhm, so we should not leave people with the idea that it's in any way easy and but, but-- what's s-- stunning about the Dhamma Brothers is that, ah, and you mention that after this movie, you said there are ordinary townspeople have a hell all the time, ah, sitting in mindfulness meditation and get stirred up and get blown away. And Jon's comment after he'd seen the movie, he could only do this in the prison with this sort of population because it would blow up anywhere else and so my understanding is that you made some modifications in your MBC-- MBSR program to make it more possible for traumatized people to help them to organized themselves. 

01:07:45
JON KABAT-ZINN Well, I think it was more a matter of learning over time about trauma because, you know we've been around for 34 years and, you know, I know anything about trauma apathy, ah, time. I don't think we've actually modified the program, what we've modified is ourselves so that we are more open, we're more sort understanding of the potential for people to run into, you know, certain kinds of difficulties with traumatic flashbacks and so forth. And we try to create that environment which is much more, much easier to do on a 10 day retreat in a prison, in a certain way or in a retreat center than it is in the busy hospital. But to try to create a holding environment (inaudible ) term that, uhm, that actually allows people to be who they are including to hate the practice and not have good experiences with practice and still feel recognized that they're experience is legitimate and it actually, it's the part of the practice to hate the practice and to be bored with the practice or to have stuff come up and as you heard when there's no outlet for the stuff to comes up, uhm, and you just invited to sit with in a container like that then interesting things happened but the amount of support that you're giving them is huge and teachers are embodying compassion by all of the ways that, I mean just the fact that they are living, they're inside a, a prison for 10 days with everybody so I think that you know in terms of whether MBSR can be develop into something that I would call mindfulness based trauma therapy that's a little bit more specialize that only so-- because we have a very heterogeneous medical population but they would only take people with a primary reason for coming with the trauma then, it could be virtually the same curriculum but you would might actually, ah, you know, change it in a certain ways that would be potentially beneficial to-- in both the terms of the practice in the holding environment. 

01:09:50
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK What we have talked about in the past is adding yoga for example. 

01:09:55
JON KABAT-ZINN Well, we did yoga apart, yeah, yeah. That's something... 

01:10:00
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Focusing all your bodily sensations rather than all the product you might only helps you to organize some of this. 

01:10:05
JON KABAT-ZINN Right, and, and just to say, I mean, we don't have the time to go into it but yoga has been mindful. Healthy yoga has been a part of MBSR from the very beginning and it's again, in some sense, a different door into the same room but that body door is very, very important to people. 

01:10:20
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Uh-hmm. 

01:10:25
JON KABAT-ZINN Ah, but I think a lot of the people of has to do with the, uhm, the holding environment. 

01:10:30
UNKNOWN See, I wanna say a couple things. Uhm, you know, the concentration practice often we focused on the idea of concentration and the one pointedness and that's certainly part of it. But when you do te practice and you do it for days on and what you can see is that what draws your attention away is the aversion and a craving. And as you concentrate and keep coming back, you're not feeding those fires of aversion and craving and those circuitries quite down so the Tibetan tradition it talk about combining or Shamatha. So yes, it's profound cortex concentrating but, you can't cultivate that one pointedness of concentration without quieting the circuitries of aversion and seeking, uhm, which can be manifesting as craving and clinging. So I think, you know, that's cynically important I think to clarify in terms of the concentration practice. It's very much about quieting for the circuitries and in grounding in your body, the body's sensations of grieving. The other thing that Jenny and I have talked about a lot is that, uhm, and, you know, Jenny's taught me about this with the Dhamma brothers is that those 3 days of the, the Anapanasati, uhm, is a resource and the guys talk about it this ways. In some other clips we have after 3 days of calming themselves, concentrating themselves, then when they open up to the body scanning, uhm, if it gets to be overwhelming they can come back to their breathing so if you think about stage oriented trauma treatment, the first stage is creating out of the safety, the kindness of the, the teachers and everything. Also weaving in the meta practice. But a lot of it is this, this breathing, this calming focus on the breathing becomes a stabilization resource that they can go back to throughout the rest of the course. Uhm, so those are a couple of thoughts I have. And then, in terms of the differences with a, with a, ah, retreated at Ba-- Barre, Massachusetts, I think that was where he was saying. Yeah, the-- that's based more clearly on you-- most of those are four foundations of mindfulness where you start with the breathing then expand out to body sensations, then sounds and sights. And so there's a progression out to finally on the last stage you get the thoughts and even when you start expanding to emotions it's only the body's sensations of emotions whereas the Goenka goes 3 days of breathing and then body scan and all these other stuff is gonna come up whereas in the four foundations. It's a graded expansion of mindful awareness until finally you can deal with emotions and thoughts and then you can perceive very subtle things like the arising of intensions and multiple motivational things arising simultaneously. We won't go all of that but you only do what that stuff at the end after the grounding and the breath and the body and you have to keep coming back to that if you get swept away. 

01:13:10
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK We had another question here. 

01:13:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, I have a question about neurobiology of change which maybe you 're gonna talk about this afternoon. About we-- you were talking about, uhm, uncoupling and I quote, and then uncertain dampening. One circuit for the, the-- seeking aversion circuits but it sound like you also have to strengthen something that's going on in the prefrontal cortex and experientially we all have this, you know, you have the attention. You try, you go down, you get up, you try, go down and after a long time you complicate something is changing. But it doesn't sound like, like, like, like, you know, a couple of synapses just rewired. 

01:13:50
UNKNOWN You know, it's an active area of research and there's a lot that could be said about it. Uhm, it has to do with synaptic connections, synaptic waitings. It has to do with actual increasing of, uhm, neurons in certain areas. Ah, it has to do with connectivity of these circuitries with each other. Ah, it has to do with habitual ways the circuitries respond to certain things. There's all kinds of-- it has to do with second messenger process, genetic processes. You know, the more-- all these different aspects of brain function as we look into it and we discover that whether it's plain piano or learning, you know, the map of London, ah, if you're a taxi driver or doing meditation practices including love and kindness practices, that it will affect the brain and all, all these different levels. And so that research is a merging-- I don't-- I think it is beyond the scope of today. They go into all of that. 

01:14:40
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK They'll be going to some of it this afternoon but there's a very nice body of, ah, research emerging particularly by the person who was in the program but didn't come. Ah, and, and so, and so it put anything but it's not her fault. Ah, Ben Hutzel who was here last year, ah, is doing some extra research on, ah, change in medial prefrontal cortex and changes in amygdala with meditation and basically what's here in Sara Lazar are coming up. It's ex-- it's exactly the areas of gray implicated in introception like looking at yourself that actually increase in activity, increase in size. Uhm, it's-- and Jon made his yes also, you know. If you want to build up your biceps, you could lift weight and if you want to get to-- be comfortable with yourself, you increase the area of your brain that is comfortable with yourself. 

01:15:25
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

01:15:25
UNKNOWN And one of the quick thing about-- that John said about, ah, MBSR for trauma. Well there are people who have adapted it in certain ways. So there's David Kearney at the, at-- in the veterans administration hospital in, in Seattle whose adapted it for vets and he's bringing in a lot meta as part... 

01:15:40
JON KABAT-ZINN Yeah. They're doing the whole love and kindness thing as well. 

01:15:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, and then there's, uhm, down the DC area, ah, I'm forgetting her first name, (inaudible ) and colleagues. They've adapted it for women with histories of sexual abuse so they haven't made major modification like you're saying but they've made some changes and woven some things in, in how they presented and, ah, you know, just to put it-- and you can-- and Lynn Wol-- Waelde is, is doing work with dissociation so people with major dissociation. How do you teach mindfulness to them? There's a book that's gonna be coming out early next year where we bring all these together in a compendium of 22 chapters on Contemplative Methods for Trauma. I mean yoga and we'll have chapters by David Kearney and Lynn Waelde . It's basically... 

01:16:20
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK You'll love it in advance. 

01:16:20
UNKNOWN Huh? 

01:16:25
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK You love to advertise your book , uhm, and... 

01:16:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, yeah. And here a good resource I think. 

01:16:30
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK What's the name of the book? Who's publishing it? 

01:16:30
UNKNOWN Contemplative Methods for Trauma Treatment, I mean, it will be out by Guilford. Uhm, you know, we can also send you some chapters in advance. You got my email before. Uhm... 

01:16:40
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Good. We have time for one more question I think. 

01:16:40
UNKNOWN Good day. Yes, regarding the treatment and the person, I was wondering, ah, one of the defect in (inaudible ) statuses of the, ah, (inaudible ). that's gonna be, ah, (inaudible ) in the society that can actually-- you know, I mean this guys, as far as I know are not getting out... 

01:17:15
UNKNOWN Well, some of these guys are out actually. Uhm, and if you're not having seen the film but we, ah, I had a call from Edward Johnson, he is now out, uhm, there is a guy also that you, you either you meet up within the movie, uhm, Charles Ice and he's living in Chicago and doing very well. Actually, he and I do kind a bit of speaking together. Uhm, so some of these guys do come out. It does not change their status in terms of, uhm, unfortunately, no matter how good you are in prison it doesn't help you get out on which is really silly and I think it used to but now, there's sort of an emphasis on, you know, you don't get-- something you get what's called good time for. You get credit for it but these guys sitting Vipassanā doesn't affect in any way their criminal status or their release date unfortunately. But it's not-- but, you know 98% of prisoners do come out so we even talked about life without parole and sometimes these guys get out. 

01:18:15
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Last question. 

01:18:15
UNKNOWN Uhm, I'm wondering if any of this has been modified to work with the children. So how, how young? 

01:18:25
JON KABAT-ZINN Well, there, there's a whole a lot of stuff going on with mindfulness in children, uhm, and, uhm, the-- ah, on-- at different ages. And of course, then there's also mindful parenting but I would stir you toward, ah, a book, ah, by Susan Kaiser Greenland who is doing some of the work with, you know, young children called the, The Mindful Child. Terrible title because there's no such thing as a mindful child just-- there's no such thing as a mindful parent but, but a marvelous book and if you just, ah, Google that, you'll find lots of stuff going on with the, with children of various ages and mindfulness in the school. This was becoming a major kind of wave of mindfulness in education as becoming a sort of major way and talking about the neuroscience now that Richard Davidson has been working-- years with, ah, his colleagues at the center for investigating healthy minds and, ah, the, ah, Madison, Wisconsin public school system working with the young kids. I think, you know, kindergarten kids and the-- I think, they are kindergarten kids and, ah, a movie is coming about that which we can also sign. 

01:19:35
UNKNOWN There is a chapter in the book... 

01:19:40
JON KABAT-ZINN No, tell us. I mean, I think it's important. 

01:19:40
UNKNOWN Uhm, oh, yeah. Mindfulness Based Enriched Through a Traumatized Kid by Randy Semple. 

01:19:45
JON KABAT-ZINN Oh, great. 

01:19:45
UNKNOWN And there are other people doing it, maybe they ever read the chapter yet but then, you know, it's out. 

01:19:50
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Okay, good to break up the morning. Ah, if you want to applaud these guys, you're feel free to do so. All right.
