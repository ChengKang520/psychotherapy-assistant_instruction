The Evolution of Psychotherapy

A Conference 

00:00:35
Supervision of a Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Otto Kernberg, M.D. 

00:00:50
OTTO KERNBERG Good morning, everybody. Um, I, first of all I'm testing whether speaking at this volume I can be heard. Um, can I be heard in the last row? I'm, I have laryngitis this morning, I apologize, I usually speak rather loudly, but I can't do it todays, but I want to make sure that, can you hear in the last row? Is this carrying enough? Okay. Fine. Then I'll be able to do it. I'll, um, whoops. This is (inaudible ). I'm try to carry out, em, supervisory session, supervisory hour, as I would do it in my office. The fact that there are glaring lights here so that neither Doctor Cockinow (ph) nor me, uh, who are here, em, can see you, em, increases the illusion that we are really alone in the consulting (ph) room. And, um, particularly now that the lights are down. Um, so, it, em, um I, I have not thought through whether, at some point, eh, we'll provide you with a chance to raise questions or comments or reactions. We haven't talked about this. Maybe we can think about, if there's time, I know an hour supervision goes by very fast. Um, okay, I know Doctor, eh, Cockinow (ph), I'm pronouncing you correctly? 

00:02:20
DOCTOR COCKINOW You are, yes. 

00:02:20
OTTO KERNBERG And, uh, myself, we have just met shortly here. I don't know him. I don't know his patients. I know as much as you do. And, um, so, I, the only thing I guess is that you have a patient whom you have in psychotherapeutic treatment and you'd like to get some outside input into it. Fair statement? 

00:02:35
DOCTOR COCKINOW (crosstalk)Correct, yeah. 

00:02:35
OTTO KERNBERG Okay, tell us about your patient. 

00:02:40
DOCTOR COCKINOW (crosstalk)C-, can people hear, can people hear me? 

00:02:40
OTTO KERNBERG Can everybody, ch-, test whether you can be heard in the last row. 

00:02:45
DOCTOR COCKINOW Is, is this alright? Are you hearing me? 

00:02:45
OTTO KERNBERG Okay. Um, l-, l-, let me just say that in, uh, I'd love to hear a little, if you could start out a little background so I can get an idea about what the patient's diagnosis is, and when I say diagnosis I don't mean, uh, simply DSM-IV label, but, uh, eh, I'd like to have a knowledge of the present symptoms or the symptoms that brought the patient to treatment, um, his present personality functioning, em, at the time when he came to treatment and, uh, what he expected from treatment. And, um, what your decision was, what kind of treatment to do. And, uh, whatever about his background you think may be relevant or necessary for me to know before we go into some recent sessions. Do you have some recent sessions with him or something like that. 

00:03:40
DOCTOR COCKINOW I, no, I didn't bring anything along. 

00:03:40
OTTO KERNBERG Okay. But, um, so, but you'll be able to talk freely about the problems that, that you have. 

00:03:45
DOCTOR COCKINOW Th-, I think the, maybe, the relationship problem. 

00:03:50
OTTO KERNBERG (crosstalk)Yeah, okay. 

00:03:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW (crosstalk)The transference, counter transference. 

00:03:50
OTTO KERNBERG Fine, very good. Um, supervision can have, um, very different characteristics. You can do strategic supervision, tactical supervision, tactical going in each session, sentence by sentence, what the patient said, what the therapist said, what might have been said, etcetera. Strategic deals with long-range developments. Eh, usually what I try to do in supervision is to switch, to go from reviewing very much in detail one single session to several sessions to what's happening over weeks and then we'd go back to a few sessions. Um, you will find out, in supervision that goes well, that there is a synchronic quality about the issues that show up in a 20 minute seg-, in a ten minute segment of a session, an entire session and over several weeks. In other words, that the same dynamics can be seen at the microscopic and a macroscopic level. Eh, I don't know whether we'll be able to illustrate this here, em, but so that you can really start with very different timespans. Okay, go ahead, please. 

00:05:10
DOCTOR COCKINOW My patient is, um, a 42-year-old, um, white male who, um, um, was referred to me in central, central clinic, I'm, um, a psych resident in Cincinnati. And, um, his presenting complaint was, is that, um, uh, that he had this intuition that he was missing something in life. Um, and the reason he said he knew this is that, um, he's been living with, um, with a woman for about four or five years, she has, um, three or four children by another, uh, another marriage. And, um, he, he had felt that everything was just going along, along perfectly. Uh, but one, the children were all getting into trouble. Uh, one of the, one of the, the sons was, um, was hospitalized with suicidal ideation. And, uh, when the child said he wasn't coming home as long as my patient was there, my patient had the first inkling that maybe he was part of the problem. And, um, and he wanted to . . . 

00:06:20
OTTO KERNBERG How old is the son? 

00:06:25
DOCTOR COCKINOW This son was 12-years-old. 

00:06:25
OTTO KERNBERG Okay. And the other one? 

00:06:25
DOCTOR COCKINOW Um, they, he has, there are four children, uh, that, that live on and off with her and in, in foster, in foster homes. And right now, I don't think any of the children are actually living in, in the family. 

00:06:45
OTTO KERNBERG Why that? 

00:06:45
DOCTOR COCKINOW Um. . . 

00:06:45
OTTO KERNBERG I mean, this man is living with this woman? 

00:06:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW Mm-hmm. 

00:06:50
OTTO KERNBERG So why are the children not with them? 

00:06:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW Uh, because the children have all had extreme problems, and th-, the woman herself, we haven't talked much about, uh, about her problem specifically, but she apparently is a very depressed woman. Um, she has fibromyalgia, um, she's now going to therapy. Um, she has, um, uh, I know some of the children, uh, were physically and emotionally abused by her first, um, her first husband, um, and I believe, uh, what, I haven't been approaching this from a family dynamic perspective, but I believe that, um, that they have just felt in-, in-, incapable of handling this, and the children have been farmed out to foster, foster homes. 

00:07:45
OTTO KERNBERG And let me, let me confess to you, I'm not approaching this from a family perspective, I'm just, I'm just, eh, trying to put myself in the patient's shoes. And my immediate question was, here is, you said, 42-year-old man, uh, he's saying he comes missing something in life, so I can see there's some vague dissatisfaction, not very specific, um, that is frequently, em, presenting symptom in patients with severe narcissistic pathology. Not necessarily, but my first thought, "Hmm, this smells like a narcissistic personality." My second thought was, "But here he's living, hopefully with a nice woman, otherwise why should he be living with her for four or five years." My next thought was, "Um, why haven't they gotten married, em, after four or five years of brushing your teeth together, you, you should know whether, eh, you would want to be married. And, if not, that's usually a symptom." Don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying everybody should get married, but I think it is one of the, potentially, very satisfactory situations in life. I hope I'm not saying anything too, uh, controversial. Uh, um, so, so, my, my question was, um, eh, immediately, "So, so why is he not marrying her?" When you told me that children are not there, I said, "Something crazy about this, why can't she take care of the children?" Now you're telling me there's something funny about her, em, so I, um, obviously I want to know more about it. I'm extremely curious how this man is going to describe this woman, because, eh, if he had a narcissistic personality, I would expect- Can you still hear me well? Is this working? Um, because, em, if he had a narcissistic personality I would assume that he may have great difficulties in describing her in a way that would make her come alive for you. We'll see. Eh, I was also thinking about finances. Does he earn enough money, eh, to support them? Is it that they, these are people living, em, in extreme poverty where getting rid of the children is almost a relief? I mean, I don't know anything about the socio-economic conditions here. These were questions I had in mind just looking from the inside of this man's, trying to ident-, put myself into his shoes. I try to put myself into the patient's shoes. By the way, that's a helpful approach, em, you try to put yourself into your patient's approa-, shoes, and then ask yourself, "How would I deal with this situation if I were this patient but I were normal?" In other words, let's assume you are normal. Let's assume, let's assume that I'm normal. And let me say, in this regard, that I'm not saying that the therapist has to be 100 percent normal, but what I'm saying is that, usually, whatever hang-ups the therapist has, they are different hang-ups from the patient, so that it's a reasonable assumption. So, you put yourself into the shoes of the patient, and then there are certain things he's not doing that you would be doing, and it's reasonable to say, ah, here's the beginning of pathology, and you start raising your questions. So, you make your diagnosis of the personality disorder by differentiating the real patients fr-, the patient from a image, a fantasy about an ideal patient that you create by putting yourself into his shoes. Do you, do you, do you follow me? 

00:11:25
DOCTOR COCKINOW Uh, I follow you, the, one of the reasons I asked for supervision on this is I'm not sure that his problem and my problem are all that different. 

00:11:30
OTTO KERNBERG Okay, um, okay, I, l-, let me say, eh, that what you just said, um, gives me several reactions. First, I appreciate your honesty. I think it's very courageous to say that. Um, and I, I admire and respect that. At the same time, eh, I'll also, I see it as my task, and I'm saying this here. I, I would, I would also say this to you if we were alone, but I'm saying it also because everybody else is here. I see it my task, therefore, to try to be helpful without intruding into the privacy of, of your life or past, and I think that is an very important part of supervision, to know exactly how to help without eh, eh, eh, exceeding limits of a relationship among equals, among colleagues. Okay, go ahead. 

00:12:30
DOCTOR COCKINOW Um, I. . . 

00:12:30
OTTO KERNBERG So you know what's going on in my mind, and I try to have the supervisee know what's going on in my mind. I think that's very helpful. 

00:12:35
DOCTOR COCKINOW Some of your questions I'll be able to answer. Um, the patient, um, uh, for eight or nine years worked as a, um, on the road salesman, I think, a manufacturer's representative. Um, he's tall, he's, he's good looking, he's re-, re-, relatively scruffily dressed, but he's very, he's very charismatic, can talk, can talk well. And he, um, he made, um, a very good living during those, those years. And, um, but his relationships were all on the road relationships. Uh, and he saved . . . 

00:13:10
OTTO KERNBERG Were what kind of relationships? I, I just . . . 

00:13:15
DOCTOR COCKINOW Well, in other words, superficial, uh, kind of, uh . . . 

00:13:15
OTTO KERNBERG (crosstalk)Right, okay. 

00:13:15
DOCTOR COCKINOW Salesman relationships. 

00:13:20
OTTO KERNBERG Yeah, okay. 

00:13:20
DOCTOR COCKINOW Patting people on the b-, on backs and smiling and drinking with em, and . . . 

00:13:25
OTTO KERNBERG Yeah, yeah. 

00:13:25
DOCTOR COCKINOW And, um, and he'd come back to Cincinnati o-, occasionally spend a weekend and, and go back out on the road. Well during that, that period of time, he saved a lot of money. Um, on one of these trips back to the, um, back to Cincinnati, um, he had a weekend relationship with a woman. Um, of which, uh, a child was born. He actually didn't even find out about this child, I think, until the child was several months old. And, um, and the woman contacted him and said, "You have some responsibilities here." And, on the basis of that, he took, he took the responsibility to comem- to give up this job on the road and, um, to, to stay in the, in Cincinnati and, uh, and, uh, um, started to try and work out a relationship with this woman and trying to be, uh, a . . . 

00:14:15
OTTO KERNBERG The, is that the woman with whom he lives now? 

00:14:20
DOCTOR COCKINOW (crosstalk)No, this is a different, this is a different woman. 

00:14:20
OTTO KERNBERG Good, I, I was getting worried. Eh, let me ask you something, did he check on whether that was, indeed, his son? I would immediately get suspicious and get a DNA test. 

00:14:30
DOCTOR COCKINOW (crosstalk)It has, it has been checked on and it was, um, and it, it was his son, and, um, and he has a sense of responsibility that, um, that he really should be, be doing something with this child. 

00:14:50
OTTO KERNBERG That speaks well for him. So, eh, that means, a well put together superego. Let me ask you a question, is there history of antisocial behavior in his case? 

00:15:00
DOCTOR COCKINOW He, um, during the 70s he was hot . . . 

00:15:00
OTTO KERNBERG Let me interrupt, eh, explain, eh, why I'm asking this question. For two reasons. Because the patient being of a narcissistic personality and per the, eh, those patients have a tendency, some of them, to have antisocial behavior. And second, because antisocial behavior is one of the two prognostically most important indicators for psychotherapeutic treatment. The paucity of the antisocial behavior, the worse the prognosis. The other, em, prognostic indicator is quality of object relationship. If there's a capacity, at least, to hang in there, regardless of how the relationship is, much better than somebody's completely isolated, alone. So, this patient, if he has no antisocial behavior, that would be good. And he has been able to live with a woman for several years, so these are two things joined that would indicate this is a man with a good prognosis. Un-, except other things that we might not know as yet. So, this is why I'm asking. Go ahead. 

00:16:05
DOCTOR COCKINOW Uh, during the 70s, he did a lot of drugs, LSD and PCP, and, uh, was hospitalized, for one two-year period he was in the hospital maybe two thirds of the time with psychosis, which he says now was a drug, drug-related psychosis. 

00:16:20
OTTO KERNBERG And, uh, is that your conviction also that it was a drug . . . 

00:16:25
DOCTOR COCKINOW It, it is my conviction, because that ended, I mean, that's been, what, almost 18 years. 

00:16:30
OTTO KERNBERG Okay. And to be (inaudible ) drugs doesn't indicate a-, antisocial behavior, necessarily. And in the 70s it was, uh, very fashionable to be on drugs. But if he has on, eh, a narcissistic personalities, you find complete adaptations to all the fashions. So, that doesn't seem, that, that doesn't seem to be so, so serious, retrospectively. He's off all drugs and alcohol at this point? 

00:16:55
DOCTOR COCKINOW He's, yes. 

00:16:55
OTTO KERNBERG Yeah, okay. Well, so, for years already. 

00:16:55
DOCTOR COCKINOW For years. 

00:17:00
OTTO KERNBERG Yeah, okay. 

00:17:00
DOCTOR COCKINOW Um, i-, the same, he, um, the, the diagnosis of antisocial, I mean, I, th-, there, it's, it's very, very broad. And, and since he has been back in the Twin Cities, or, in, um, Cincinnati, he has not really had any kind of steady employment. He's, he, he does part-time carpentry, some part-time plumbing, but he does really, almost, a, eh, as far as I can see . . . 

00:17:30
OTTO KERNBERG Well, why's that? 

00:17:35
DOCTOR COCKINOW I, I think because he's having difficulty making a decision to, to really launch into anything, and he's able to live frugally. He, he inherited his house from his parents, it's paid off. He can live on a, on a shoestring, and so he has, um, the money that he put away while he was, um, on the road, the money he saved in his, uh, pension stub (ph), he has been drawing on that since that time, and managing to, um, uh, to live for . . . 

00:18:10
OTTO KERNBERG But he's depleting his capital, it's seeming. 

00:18:10
DOCTOR COCKINOW (crosstalk)He's depleting his capital. 

00:18:10
OTTO KERNBERG So, it's, em, there's something self-destructive here. 

00:18:15
DOCTOR COCKINOW He's d-, and he is . . . 

00:18:15
OTTO KERNBERG I mean, if I were 42, were living on savings that, that just decapitalizing without a stable job, I would feel anxious. 

00:18:25
DOCTOR COCKINOW And this is, he i-, he is not very anxious, or, at least, he's not consciously. He's not consciously very anxious. Uh, eh . . . 

00:18:35
OTTO KERNBERG So, so this may indicate that, that he's not living on anybody else, there i-, there's no parasitic exploitation of anybody else. 

00:18:40
DOCTOR COCKINOW No. No. 

00:18:40
OTTO KERNBERG He's just depleting his own resources, and destroying the security of the future, of his old age. 

00:18:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW And he, he knows he has to make a decision, but he doesn't really care to be, he doesn't make it. And he d-, he doesn't even, uh, obsess too much about not making it. 

00:19:00
OTTO KERNBERG Okay, that indicates a strong self destructive tendency. So, there may be an acting out of self-destructive behavior, and there may be an unconscious assumption that it's really your responsibility to make it work. And, uh, if he destroys himself, it serves you right. In other words, the acting out of severe masochistic tendencies, which gives a new angle to the case? Um, let me say that when I engage in a long-term psychotherapy with a patient, I try to have his life as normal as possible, em, in terms of external arrangements, to avoid. during the treatment, the acting out of further self-destructiveness in parallel to the treatment. If this man is destroying himself financially, while supposedly getting help from you to improve his life. So, I would interpret his, um, not caring about work as an unconsciously motivated, unconsciously motivated self destructive wish, em, acted out silently. And I'm now thinking about his taking on the responsibility for this child that he engendered over a weekend in a casual relationship, what happened that weekend? Why didn't he, did he not take contraceptive precautions? Did he expect the woman with whom he was would take it? How come they simply went to bed without-, did they talk about it? It's not essential, but it's something also it's, it's, um, funny, here, because, normally, I would expect a man, as well as a woman, em, to, to take precautions not to get pregnant if they don't want to have a child. And not to have a child because it's imposed by destiny rather than wanted. So that, that's a self-destructive tendency on, on part of both. Of course it may well be that on his part he just has, with irresponsible exploitation of women, he just has sex casually, let them take care if they want to, and then he washes his hands, but that's not this case. So, so, I'm, I'm seeing something very self-destructive here. And my recommendation would be, in terms of treatment, I would take this up with him and, um, analyze it as a symptom that he's not concerned. Um, th-, this whole thing is ridiculous because he could pick up any job, if he doesn't like, if he doesn't like it, because he can always change that. And, um, and treatment should not be used, the least you can expect from treatment is that, that it should not collude with the patient's destroying himself physically, psychologically, financially, further. Okay. 

00:21:55
DOCTOR COCKINOW One thing that you mentioned that struck a bell with me is when you talked about narcissistic personality you, y-, you talked about their tendency t-, to go along with, with fads, whatever, whatever's current at the time, and, and one sense I get from him is that, um, the fad that he is currently in is that he should, he should care, he should be involved emotionally. He, in, in the, um, this child that he fostered, um, he and the, the wife were assigned to do, um, to do family therapy, um, by the courts, and this patient showed up at that family therapy for 20 to 25 weeks by himself because the wife is, is acting out and she wouldn't bring the child. So . . . 

00:22:50
OTTO KERNBERG Which one, eh, which one, th-, the wife, you mean the woman? 

00:22:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW The wo-, not the wife, excuse me. 

00:22:50
OTTO KERNBERG The weekend woman. 

00:22:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW Yeah, the weekend woman. 

00:22:50
OTTO KERNBERG So, the weekend woman did not show up? 

00:22:55
DOCTOR COCKINOW Didn't show up. Nor did the child show up. But he went to therapy. 

00:23:00
OTTO KERNBERG Th-, th-, the child lives with that woman? 

00:23:00
DOCTOR COCKINOW Yes. 

00:23:00
OTTO KERNBERG He's supporting that child financially? 

00:23:05
DOCTOR COCKINOW He is supporting, he is supporting, yes. 

00:23:05
OTTO KERNBERG What does the wife do? The, the woman, the weekend woman do? 

00:23:10
DOCTOR COCKINOW I'm not, I'm not sure what she does. 

00:23:10
OTTO KERNBERG Is she working? 

00:23:10
DOCTOR COCKINOW Yeah, he doesn't paint her as a wicked woman. 

00:23:15
OTTO KERNBERG Uh, I'm not saying she's wicked, I'm just, eh, saying she seems to be totally different in kindness to her child, willing to get money for him but not even willing to show up when her child is going to be helped. It's not the kind of woman I would like to get involved, not even over the weekend. 

00:23:30
DOCTOR COCKINOW Given the pa- . . . 

00:23:30
OTTO KERNBERG Would you? 

00:23:30
DOCTOR COCKINOW I, I agree completely. And I think, I think my patient would agree with that also. 

00:23:35
OTTO KERNBERG Yeah. He, he doesn't have good judgment with women, does he? 

00:23:40
DOCTOR COCKINOW No, he, he has, my, my patient, uh, to give some indication of, maybe, his poor judgment, th-, the day he showed up, he brought me psych testing. He, he, he believes very much in the system, so he got the psych testing and IQ testing and he, he, he presented me with a paper that showed that he had a, a verbal IQ of 130 and a performance IQ of 123. And he, um, he scratches his head and he says, "You know, this, kind of, comes as a shock to me, because this says I'm, you know, I'm, I'm really above average." 

00:24:10
OTTO KERNBERG Th-, th-, who's, who's test, th-, I got lost, who's, uh . . . 

00:24:15
DOCTOR COCKINOW Well, they, they, eh, before he came to me in the referral, in the referral process, uh, he had, uh, ha-, he went to intake and, uh, he wanted everything done. 

00:24:25
OTTO KERNBERG Oh, the psych tests, yeah, he's not, not on that child, not that (inaudible crosstalk ), okay. 

00:24:28
DOCTOR COCKINOW (crosstalk)No, no, no, no, I'm, he, uh, we're talking about judgment and, um. . . 

00:24:30
OTTO KERNBERG Yeah, okay. 

00:24:30
DOCTOR COCKINOW And so forth. And, um, so he doesn't, eh, when it comes to women, no, he doesn't show very, uh, very good judgment. 

00:24:35
OTTO KERNBERG (crosstalk)Yeah, sure. 

00:24:35
DOCTOR COCKINOW He, he, but he, uh, uh, and my point that I was trying to make is that he has a lot of intellectual, um, intellectual skills, he, tall, good-looking. 

00:24:45
OTTO KERNBERG Okay. How much money does he have? What are his savings? Do you know that? 

00:24:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW You know, I don't, I don't know. I, I, I haven't asked. 

00:24:50
OTTO KERNBERG Oh, I would, I would, a patient who doesn't work, who lives on his savings, who I suspect is ruining himself, I would go in great detail. What does he have? I would figure out at what point would he be down to zero? 

00:25:00
DOCTOR COCKINOW Hmmm, I, I, I haven't even asked him. 

00:25:05
OTTO KERNBERG Oh. It may be that he's depleting himself. That, that you may think, because he's so relaxed, um, there's no danger, and he may be in a disastrous, how much is he paying for that child? 

00:25:15
DOCTOR COCKINOW Um, I don't know, I don't know that either. 

00:25:20
OTTO KERNBERG Okay. I would, you know, they say it's ha-, difficult to talk about sex and, no, I'm sorry, it's difficult to talk about aggression, more difficult to talk about sex, most difficult to talk about money. Eh, that is true. As a therapist, I would, I would try, eh, p-, particularly in this case to get very clear indications. And you may find out, once you know everything about money, that this man is on a disastrous course of self-destruct. 

00:25:45
DOCTOR COCKINOW Mmmhmm. 

00:25:45
OTTO KERNBERG Does the woman work with whom he lives? 

00:25:45
DOCTOR COCKINOW No. No. 

00:25:45
OTTO KERNBERG Why not? Is he attracted . . . 

00:25:55
DOCTOR COCKINOW Because of her own disabilities, her, um, her depression, her fibromyalgia, um, she's a . . . 

00:26:00
OTTO KERNBERG Um, I don't know much about fibromyalgia. Eh, would fibromyalgia interfere with her having a full-time job? Because in my, not in my opinion, am I wrong? 

00:26:05
DOCTOR COCKINOW If, if, if she was in, in Nepal it would not interfere, in this country it interferes. I mean, in the third world where you have to work to survive, it would not interfere. Here, um, it is part of, um, her disability. So she doesn't need to, um, this is the government . . . 

00:26:25
OTTO KERNBERG I mean, I'm asking now, you're a physician. 

00:26:25
DOCTOR COCKINOW Yes. 

00:26:30
OTTO KERNBERG W-, eh. . . 

00:26:30
DOCTOR COCKINOW Fibromyalgia no, is a s-, is, um, a syndrome of having pain, aches and pains, um, which, um, nobody can find any, uh, physiological ideology for. 

00:26:40
OTTO KERNBERG Yes, (inaudible crosstalk ), which could be controlled sufficiently by mild pain killers so that a person could take a cl-, office secretarial job, for example? 

00:26:45
DOCTOR COCKINOW There is no, eh, fibromyalgia also is the tip of the iceberg of, um, of a psychological disorder. 

00:26:55
OTTO KERNBERG Yeah. Forget about psychology for a moment. 

00:26:55
DOCTOR COCKINOW B-, she could work, she c-, she could, she is physically capable of working. 

00:27:00
OTTO KERNBERG She's, that's all I'm asking, because that was my assumption. That she was physically capable of working. She has how many children at home now? 

00:27:10
DOCTOR COCKINOW Um, the . . . 

00:27:10
OTTO KERNBERG One? 

00:27:10
DOCTOR COCKINOW Uh, uh, the oldest child, um, has just moved back into the home. Um, this is, um, an 18 or a 19-year-old woman with her, um, with her husband. The other children are in foster care. 

00:27:25
OTTO KERNBERG And the, and they are in foster care be-, because they all have severe problems and can't live with . . . 

00:27:30
DOCTOR COCKINOW Because the family was, um, not functioning well, and because, um, uh, I, I don't, I don't know whether she asked them to go into foster care or whether the court systems, actually, cuz they were acting out so much. 

00:27:45
OTTO KERNBERG If you lived with a woman who had her children shipped out to foster care who was able to work and doesn't work, would you raise questions? 

00:27:55
DOCTOR COCKINOW Um, I would. 

00:28:00
OTTO KERNBERG You would? Okay. If you would, then your patient should too. And this is fact . . . 

00:28:05
DOCTOR COCKINOW (crosstalk)This is a big problem with the patient. 

00:28:05
OTTO KERNBERG Okay, but then, then he's living with a woman, correct me if I'm wrong, I get the impression that he's living with a passive, hypochondriacal woman who washes her hand of the responsibility with children, lives sponging off him. Does she have a true depression, and not, then why has the, depression has very good prognosis with treatment. Why, how long has she had this depression? A month, a week, a month, a year, ten years, 50 years? 

00:28:35
DOCTOR COCKINOW A long time. 

00:28:35
OTTO KERNBERG So, when you have a depression, and it never gets better? It's always there? 

00:28:40
DOCTOR COCKINOW Yes, it's . . . 

00:28:40
OTTO KERNBERG (crosstalk)So it's probably, if they s-, if it, have you talked with her psychiatrist? 

00:28:45
DOCTOR COCKINOW No. 

00:28:45
OTTO KERNBERG Has he talked with her psychiatrist? 

00:28:45
DOCTOR COCKINOW He, he, he's, um, she had a, uh, a therapist, I haven't talked with, and no, no he hasn't either. 

00:28:50
OTTO KERNBERG He has not talked with, so how does he know she has a depression? 

00:28:55
DOCTOR COCKINOW H-, he's not bothered by that. 

00:29:00
OTTO KERNBERG Okay, so, there is, eh, if it is true that she is depressed, it's most probably a characterilogical (ph) depression that can be treated, that should have been improved. So it, it smells like a normal, secondary gain of illness. Hypochondriacal person with secondary gain of illness who is sponging off him. In addition, the other woman always, uh, sponges off him. Th-, th-, th-, he, he looks more and more masochistic in addition to narcissistic and doesn't raise any of these questions. I would, I would, I would bring up with him. He says he's missing something in life, "I have an answer, sir," I would tell him. 

00:29:35
DOCTOR COCKINOW Eh, eh, excuse me? 

00:29:40
OTTO KERNBERG I would, I would tell my patient, you know, "You're saying you are missing something in life, what you're missing are the glaring problems that you have every day and you act as if it were not there. You are not working, you are not working. You are not-" Now, now why, why the, please don't applaud. Uh, em, let me tell you why I'm saying you should not applaud. Because, um, em, if all of us agree, I'm saying this to each of you individually, if all of us agree and there's a kind of a ground swell which should be done that creates the danger of a kind of a mass psychology. And you should preserve your individual thinking. Um, this is true for every one of you. You are not only part of an anonymous mass, you are individual therapists. What I'm saying here, I'm talking very freely about what I would do, but that's not the will of God. Some of the things I'm saying can be right, others wrong, you have to make your own judgment. And I'm not pretending that everything I'm saying here is all right, so I'm, this is why I was worried about the applause. It may create a kind of a swing of idealization of what I'm saying in contrast to the need to keep always a critical judgment and form your own theory. And, the same thing, I'm, I'm, now I'm we're back to you. Eh, I'm, I'm dramatizing a viewpoint not because all of these things are the most urgent one, I'm just giving you reactions. There, there may be much more going on, and some of what I'm saying may be wrong and I may change it around once I, I hear more about the case. But, so far, is this as close as, yeah, but so far, I would, em, raise with him the question, em, confront him with his self-destructive passivity not working, self-destructive passivity in, um, eh, um, not raising questions about the women with whom he lives. Um, and maybe he's paying inordinate amount of child support to a woman with whom he is not married rather than the minimum legal. And, for a woman . . . 

00:31:55
DOCTOR COCKINOW It has been the minimum legal. 

00:31:55
OTTO KERNBERG Okay, um, and, um, eh, eh, I would raise, of course, the most important question, "Does he really love that woman with whom he lives?" And, um, if not, why not? And is this his, uh, being stuck in a self destructive situation, uh, or not? W-, what's the nature of the relationship? 

00:32:15
DOCTOR COCKINOW (crosstalk)He doesn't see his relationship as being self destructive. Um, I'm still struggling with what the dyn- . . . 

00:32:20
OTTO KERNBERG (inaudible )Excuse me, and, of course, I would confront him with the self-destructive depletion of his resources, for which you have to have very full knowledge. So, you have to heat it up, em, eh, eh, for him. Eh, by the way, you're seeing him in face-to-face psychotherapy? 

00:32:35
DOCTOR COCKINOW Yes. 

00:32:35
OTTO KERNBERG Would you define it as a psychodynamic psychotherapy? 

00:32:40
DOCTOR COCKINOW I, that was my, my motivation. Given his intelligence and, um, um, and his articulateness, um, when I first met him, um, that was my, my goal. This was one of my long-term cases. I'm not sure that it really is turning into a, a, a, a psychodynamic case. 

00:33:00
OTTO KERNBERG Well, let me tell you. So far, I think that the indication is for psychodynamic psychotherapy. If this man indeed suffers (ph) a severe narcissistic personality with strong masochistic features, um, that would give him most chances for significant change. You see him how often a week? Once? Twice? 

00:33:20
DOCTOR COCKINOW Once, once a week. 

00:33:20
OTTO KERNBERG Once a week, that interferes with the possibility of a, eh, psychodynamic psychotherapy, particularly in the case of a narcissistic patient who have enormous difficulties to enter into a dependent, transference relationship. Narcissistic personalities tend to maintain themselves at an enormous distance. You see them once a week, it becomes necessarily supportive and, eh, eh, then there is a question of really, whether, if it's going to be supportive at all whether one should really march in, em, and be very, strongly confrontational and, uh, and, um, and, uh, providing confrontation, advice, etcetera. I-, in supportive psychotherapy with suggestion, support, advice, environmental intervention, etcetera. Or whether you should go into analytic direction, eh, interpreting the transference. And I, ideally, with such a p-, if I were the patient, if it's me, I would prefer that somebody treat my psychodynamically and help me change my personality rather than simply adjusting myself to a sick personality, do you follow me? So I would . . . 

00:34:30
DOCTOR COCKINOW And then that is his goal. 

00:34:30
OTTO KERNBERG I would give him, uh, and, so, this p-, do you see him privately or, (inaudible ) outpatient department? 

00:34:40
DOCTOR COCKINOW Outpatient, eh, eh, it's an outpatient department, uh. . . 

00:34:40
OTTO KERNBERG So he's, how much is he paying per visit? 

00:34:45
DOCTOR COCKINOW He's not paying anything. 

00:34:45
OTTO KERNBERG He's not paying anything? 

00:34:45
DOCTOR COCKINOW He knows how to work the system, this man lives on a shoestring. 

00:34:50
OTTO KERNBERG Okay, I, I might tell such a patient that he should work and then go into private psychotherapy, with me or anybody else. Recommend, as a minimum, two sessions per week, and have him work at least to pay for his psychotherapy. 

00:35:05
DOCTOR COCKINOW Why should he do that when he's got me for nothing? 

00:35:05
OTTO KERNBERG Um, em, you may, eh, well decide, um, under such conditions, one of two roads. Either continue in the supportive approach once a week, risk that na-, n-, nothing much may happen, or suggest that he immediately shift into two sessions a week, knowing that it will increase his exploitation of you and the system, I guess of the system, not of you. And confront him clearly with his self-destructive tendencies about work, and, and, um, create a time limit within which you'll expect him to work, to be earning and adequate salary, eh, to c-, to take care of his needs. And, um, you are now a third-year resident? 

00:35:55
DOCTOR COCKINOW Yes, that's correct. 

00:35:55
OTTO KERNBERG Okay, you'll graduate after another year? 

00:36:00
DOCTOR COCKINOW (crosstalk)One, a year and a half. 

00:36:00
OTTO KERNBERG So, he may still sponge the system for a year and a half. But then, if you're treating him well and he wants to continue with you, then he should go into, either should go into private practice and be seen by you, or, in a year and a half, you will make a decision whether you've reached the maximum he can reach and you can terminate his treatment. But, that, I think, ideally, eventually, should, that should be, become a private patient. And, for the time being, you act against the handicap of his exploiting the system. But, at least you can confront him strongly with what he has to do in order to continue in the treatment approach. And, if you don't see him at least twice a week and the patient with a narcissistic personality, probably more than that, but at least as a minimum, it will be very difficult to work psychodynamically with him. I'm not surprised y-, that you should feel stuck with him, because the frequency of the treatment, the nature of his personality and the arrangements militate (ph) against heating things up. Okay, back to, back to, um, eh, what's the relationship to this woman? What is her first name? Th-, the woman with whom he lives? 

00:37:10
DOCTOR COCKINOW Susan. 

00:37:10
OTTO KERNBERG Susan. By the way, does he have any relationship with the weekend woman, or not really? Only sends money? 

00:37:15
DOCTOR COCKINOW The weekend woman will not have any relationship with him. Um, uh, even, and to the point of showing up with the therapist, um . . . 

00:37:25
OTTO KERNBERG Okay. So, does he have any relationship to that child? 

00:37:25
DOCTOR COCKINOW He tried. The first three months that we met, the dynamics with his trying to father this child, um, were the focus of, of our conversation. I had not been very directive, but he would come in and, and, um, and tell me what he was doing with Julien, going to the, going to the softball games or the baseball games that Julien . . . 

00:37:50
OTTO KERNBERG Who, who's Julien? 

00:37:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW Julien is the child that he . . . 

00:37:55
OTTO KERNBERG Julien? 

00:37:55
DOCTOR COCKINOW Julien. Is a nine, is a nine-year-old. 

00:37:55
OTTO KERNBERG (crosstalk)Julien, yes. Yeah. 

00:37:55
DOCTOR COCKINOW And, um, and, and giving me the details of, um, of his going to therapy by himself, of his, um, everything he is doing right to be, to be a good, a, a good person. Um, uh, but very often this, everything that he tried to do, this woman would, would very often block. And at the same time he wouldn't, he didn't get excited about this. He, um, he didn't get excited about the fact that this woman was, um, continually obstructing his efforts to be a father to this child, um, he reported it very, very distantly. Being explo-, I mean, he's being exploited, he, uh, and, and I, I did interpret that. 

00:38:40
OTTO KERNBERG He has been exploited by a woman who, by the way, didn't approach him until the child was seven months. She never tried to reach him while she was pregnant. 

00:38:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW Yeah, that's . . . 

00:38:50
OTTO KERNBERG There's something totally crazy about this situation. 

00:38:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW Well, there is, it's crazy, but also, remember, he was on the, on the road, um . . . 

00:38:55
OTTO KERNBERG Well, but even from the, on the road, uh, you can reach somebody on the road and except if it's . . . 

00:39:00
DOCTOR COCKINOW They had very little, I, I don't know, I, I'm not even, I can't remember quite how there is a, she discovered, it was difficult for her to find him. But yeah it's, it's not a, it's not your recommended relationship. 

00:39:10
OTTO KERNBERG But, but now, um, but now, so, is Julien in, still in his life? Is he, I mean, he's, after all, the father of a real child there. 

00:39:20
DOCTOR COCKINOW And, and for three months or so he acted like this was the only thing that was really important to him was being the father of this. And then, we have s-, I really don't recall when that dynamic switched, but he hasn't said a thing about Julien, um . . . 

00:39:40
OTTO KERNBERG Has he, so, he hasn't seen Julien for how long? 

00:39:40
DOCTOR COCKINOW For, now, it's probably been about three months. 

00:39:45
OTTO KERNBERG So, so there is not any ongoing fatherly relationship to this child. 

00:39:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW Currently, no, um, and when Julien was the focus of conversation, I had the feeling that he was talking about his relationship with this child not because he had this great, this feeling of fatherhood, but that he should have a feeling of being, um, a father. 

00:40:05
OTTO KERNBERG So it, was it kind of a mechanical, conventional behavior? Try to be a good guy without any real feeling or is this . . . 

00:40:10
DOCTOR COCKINOW That, that was my, that was my feeling. 

00:40:15
OTTO KERNBERG (crosstalk)Okay, now, what about this woman with whom he lives. What's her nickname again? 

00:40:15
DOCTOR COCKINOW Susan. 

00:40:15
OTTO KERNBERG Susan, yeah. How old is she? 

00:40:20
DOCTOR COCKINOW Um, 40. 

00:40:25
OTTO KERNBERG 40. And, um, what, how, what's the relationship like? 

00:40:30
DOCTOR COCKINOW He gets . . . 

00:40:30
OTTO KERNBERG Why has he lived with her for four years? 

00:40:30
DOCTOR COCKINOW Because she's sensitive, and, um, and supportive. I think she's like his mother. Eh, his mother, he described as, really, just doing nothing, uh, uh, being a saint. 

00:40:50
OTTO KERNBERG Okay. Now, do you get any realistic picture of, of Susan? Does he describe her? Do, uh, does she seem a real person to you, or a shadow? How much do you know about her? 

00:41:00
DOCTOR COCKINOW I . . . 

00:41:05
OTTO KERNBERG What does he feel about her? 

00:41:05
DOCTOR COCKINOW I d-, I don't know a lot about her, but I, I guess I, how much I'm, I'm projecting, I, I, I feel a woman that is very, very sensitive to, this is a man that, uh, a alexithymia, I think, is, maybe, a fair word to use. Um, and I think she is very conscious of her, um, I, she's very sensitive and she provides the emotional work in the, in the family and he provides the money and, um, and in that way I, I do feel I have a picture of, um, of this woman. 

00:41:40
OTTO KERNBERG I, I don't have a picture of her at all. I'm, I'm puzzled. On the one hand she has her children, whom she ships out and doesn't care at all. She almost seems to cater to him. Right? 

00:41:55
DOCTOR COCKINOW I'm not sure that it's true that she doesn't care. Uh, maybe she cared, cared too much. The children were, were, were acting out within the family dynamic. I, I, I, I, I . . . 

00:42:05
OTTO KERNBERG At the same time, how, how is their daily, do they enjoy each other? Do they go out? Do they have things in common? 

00:42:15
DOCTOR COCKINOW (crosstalk)No, they don't, they don't go out. They talk, they talk very little. Um, uh, um, um, they, they do very little together. He, he does odds and ends around the house. Um, I think she sleeps a lot. Um. . . 

00:42:30
OTTO KERNBERG D-, does he love her? Have you asked him? 

00:42:35
DOCTOR COCKINOW I, I, I didn't ask. I guess I, I didn't ask that question cuz I'm never quite sure what I'm asking when I ask it. So I, I haven't asked him whether . . . 

00:42:45
OTTO KERNBERG Y-, you're never sure. . . 

00:42:45
DOCTOR COCKINOW You know, what that means. Do, you know, do you love somebody. Uh. . . 

00:42:50
OTTO KERNBERG Um . . . 

00:42:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW Uh, he, I'm going by the behavior that he's living with this woman for five years that, uh, and he would tell me he loves her. I, but I haven't asked the question specifically. 

00:43:05
OTTO KERNBERG Um, would you ask a pat-, other patients whether they are in love with the woman they are with or not really? Does it mean anything to be in love with the woman? 

00:43:15
DOCTOR COCKINOW You're asking my own feelings about that? 

00:43:15
OTTO KERNBERG (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. 

00:43:20
DOCTOR COCKINOW Um. . . 

00:43:25
[sil.] 

00:43:30
DOCTOR COCKINOW I . . . 

00:43:30
OTTO KERNBERG I mean, does it make a difference if you live with a woman whom you love or with, if you live with a woman because it's convenient? 

00:43:40
DOCTOR COCKINOW I'm familiar with I-, India where there are arranged marriages, and so I'm confused about this myself. I've seen long-term relationships work better when they are not love relationships. Um, and i-, in our society . . . 

00:43:50
OTTO KERNBERG But, but, uh, but does it make a difference? 

00:43:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW I-, it's a place to start. Is the attraction, what, I think it is important. 

00:43:55
OTTO KERNBERG So, a-, are you, uh, I'm asking that because of the comment you made earlier saying you wouldn't know exactly what to expect from such a question if you raised it with him. Uh, did I hear you correctly? 

00:44:10
DOCTOR COCKINOW I, uh, I think I don't ask that question very often because, because I, I, people tell me that they're living with somebody, of course I love em, type of, yeah. 

00:44:20
OTTO KERNBERG I, I always ask that question. And I, I, em, I, I, s-, I, I'm not quite sure about what I'm saying, but th-, maybe this is an area where, that you were thinking about when you said there's some ways in which you feel your own existential view kind of is, em, somewhat resonates with the patient's or vice versa. I don't, I'm not, I don't want to raise any personal questions, but I would say that if you feel uncertain whether it makes a difference if there is a love relation or not in an ongoing relationship, I would suggest that may reflect the, eh, difficulty that is similar in the patient and you. If that were so. Um, let me say something about narcissistic pathology. Em, narcissistic patients have an enormous difficulty of really loving. The most severe ones can't even fall in love ever. I always ask patients, "Have you ever fallen in love?" And if the patient says, well, of course, if it's a 13-year-old, that may not have been the case, it's much less valuable in, in, in early adolescence. But once you get into the 20s, I ask them, "Have you ever been in love?" And if they say, "Well, I don't know what love, what is, what is really love?" I know they have not been. It's the same when you ask somebody, "Have you had an orgasm?" and the person says, "Well, I'm not sure." When you have an orgasm, you have an orgasm. And, um, 10 minutes, oh my God, time went by very fast. Um, em, I, em, th-, th-, the capacity to feel that one in, is in a loving relationship, um, is an important aspect of an optimal and rich life. To, to love a person is different from just being comfortable. And, um, I think under normal circumstances, it, it doesn't mean that one is in a romantic situation, you know, candlelight and all that all the time, but there's a sense of mutual enjoyment, belonging, that has, from time to time, a passionate element. And, uh, it's very different from just, uh, living with somebody, eh, because it's comfortable and this is, uh, the way it, it all worked out. Um, so, this may be a problem here. And there, and I'm not sure how well he's describing his relationship with her. I would wonder whether there is something mutually giving, eh, an emotional enrichment or not. I would be interested, what have his relationships been with other women, maybe he has never had anything better with any woman. And when he says he's missing something in life, he is missing the capacity to enjoy work, he is missing the capacity to enjoy love, and, and that's, um, that's a problem. 

00:47:20
DOCTOR COCKINOW (crosstalk)And would you, but I should put that on the, on the table. I mean, I haven't . . . 

00:47:20
OTTO KERNBERG (crosstalk)I would put this on the, I would put that on the table and say, "Why are you living with her? Is this, um, the, the woman of your life?" How is their sexual relation, by the way? There, there are three aspects of love relations, the sexual relationships, the emotional relationsh-, ship, and the com-, the, the value system that the, the ideal for what life should be like and that they realize in living together. So, at the emotional level it sounds to, it doesn't sound very rich to me at this point. How is it at the sexual level? Do they enjoy sex with each other? Is it great? 

00:48:00
DOCTOR COCKINOW No, it's, it's not great. Um, she's often too tired, um, and, um, they don't have sex very often. Um. . . 

00:48:10
OTTO KERNBERG How often? Once a day, once a week, once a month, once a year, once every ten years? 

00:48:10
DOCTOR COCKINOW I'm, I'm not sure. I think . . . 

00:48:15
OTTO KERNBERG Have you asked him? 

00:48:15
DOCTOR COCKINOW I, I haven't asked him specifically, no. 

00:48:15
OTTO KERNBERG I would ask him about his sexual life. I'm very interested in the sexual life of my patients. One of the first things that I ask. He's 42-years-old, she's 40-years-old, they should have, normally, eh, eh, a love life of frequent sex. Once, twice, three times, four times a week, five times a week. It, there's enormous variation, but at least an ongoing sexual relationship in which they are able to achieve, obviously, orgasm, but also emotional pleasure, pleasure. Is that, so, I'm not, why have they not married? 

00:48:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW Um, he has difficulty making decisions. And, and I . . . 

00:48:55
OTTO KERNBERG (crosstalk)And, in this case. . . 

00:49:00
DOCTOR COCKINOW And I don't know that she has pressured him. Th-, they seem to be content, like an old, content couple that just have . . . 

00:49:05
OTTO KERNBERG (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. 

00:49:05
DOCTOR COCKINOW Don't rock the boat type of thing. 

00:49:10
OTTO KERNBERG And what is, does he have any ideal for himself? Does he think, eh, li-, eh, it's worthwhile to try to marry a woman whom he loves with whom he may have a, or, or not really? What, uh, what are his aspirations? 

00:49:20
DOCTOR COCKINOW (crosstalk)He ha-, he hasn't formulated, he hasn't formulated that. 

00:49:25
OTTO KERNBERG He has not thought about this. 

00:49:25
DOCTOR COCKINOW He hasn't. 

00:49:25
OTTO KERNBERG Has he thought about whether he would be happier with any other woman. 

00:49:30
DOCTOR COCKINOW I didn't, I didn't ask him that. He thinks this woman is great. I mean, he does think this woman is great, but maybe he, you know, (inaudible crosstalk ) 

00:49:37
OTTO KERNBERG (crosstalk)But she's great and what, what is the gratification he obtains from her? 

00:49:37
DOCTOR COCKINOW The emotional, um, sensitivity that she has to him. 

00:49:40
OTTO KERNBERG How does that show? 

00:49:40
DOCTOR COCKINOW Um, that, um, that she nurtures. I, I think . . . 

00:49:50
OTTO KERNBERG And then, how does she nurture? She has the food ready? (inaudible crosstalk ) 

00:49:53
DOCTOR COCKINOW She does, she does cook. 

00:49:53
OTTO KERNBERG So he has all the food. He has all the clothing. And during the day she doesn't bother him because she sleeps. 

00:50:00
DOCTOR COCKINOW Yeah. 

00:50:00
OTTO KERNBERG Is that a fair statement? Do they thin-, do they enjoy things together? 

00:50:05
DOCTOR COCKINOW (crosstalk)I think, yeah, I think that's . . . 

00:50:05
OTTO KERNBERG Do they do things together? 

00:50:05
DOCTOR COCKINOW They don't do many things. They, they, they never go out. 

00:50:05
OTTO KERNBERG Okay, you're giving me a contradictory picture of (inaudible ). 

00:50:12
DOCTOR COCKINOW Well, uh, you mean of what mean, what it means to nurture? 

00:50:15
OTTO KERNBERG Yes. 

00:50:15
DOCTOR COCKINOW Um, he, he lives on her sensitivity. Th-, th-, that he feels that he, he, he needs that. That she supports, she supports him. But, when I asked him about what they do together, they, they sit down and have a meal together. If they, if a problem comes up like with this, the, the child moving back into that home, they are able to discuss this and they communicate. He is, he finds that he can communicate with her, and they understand each other in that sort of way. 

00:50:40
OTTO KERNBERG (crosstalk)Fine. Has he had previous relations with other women? 

00:50:45
DOCTOR COCKINOW Not long-term relationships, no. 

00:50:45
OTTO KERNBERG No long term relationships? What was the longest term? 

00:50:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW I don't know. 

00:50:50
OTTO KERNBERG You have, you don't know about that. 

00:50:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW I don't know. 

00:50:50
OTTO KERNBERG Okay. Now, let me, I have taken up a lot of your time raising the questions I would raise in evaluating such a patient. What do you see as your, we only have five minutes left, um, what do you see as the main problem you have with him right now in the treatment? 

00:51:10
DOCTOR COCKINOW Um, with, I, I have felt all along that the patient has been very, very competitive, um, with me. And, um, he, he, he told me originally that he had almost no childhood memories. Um, and, um, uh, and he has, he, in, in the, in, in the ongoing dynamic he is constantly, kind of, trying o read my mind, um, analyze me, analyze the situation. Being very, very clever at it, um, he actually, uh, uh, he confuses, he confuses me. And I find that, uh, there's a competitive side of me that, um, that, uh, wants to, um, um, to be clever. To, uh, to try and solve his problems cognitively. Um, and, and every time I succeed in doing this, I get the feeling that I'm just, actually, um, driving a wedge between our, our relationship. So, I, I have . . . 

00:52:20
OTTO KERNBERG But, what would be solving his problems cognitively? What is the kind of thing that you try to do from time to time and it doesn't work. 

00:52:30
DOCTOR COCKINOW Uh, making some kind, making a, an interpretation. Like, I, um, we came down to the possibility that we, well, maybe he's ADH. And so, um, um, so I said, "Well, why don't we try some Ritalin and see if that would, um, would help." Uh. . . 

00:52:45
OTTO KERNBERG So, you have implied that you are giving up psychological understanding of change, that you're . . . 

00:52:45
DOCTOR COCKINOW I decided to use that as a diagnostic tool to see if he would be willing to try. 

00:52:50
OTTO KERNBERG Yeah, okay. 

00:52:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW To see if it would improve anything. 

00:52:55
OTTO KERNBERG Yeah, um, I, I can see your sense that, uh, there's a kind of a stalemate in the psychotherapy. Um, that he has no memories about the childhood, I'm not surprised. What you have described is a person who is so blind he has no memory of the present. Um, I, I think that, em, what is going on is that tremendous acting out of the passivity of a self-destructive, self- involved passivity. Life is bypassing him. He is living with a woman with whom it seems he has minimal relationship, minimal relationship to work. Th-, this is a slow tragedy developing. I would confront him with that, and that his intellectual gains with you is the least thing he can afford, but he has serious problems. And, um, I, I think that, given this competitiveness, trying to outguess you, em, probably reflect unconscious envy of you, typical of narcissistic personalities, and that needs to be terminated in the transference, but you can't do transference interpretation seeing him once a week. My recommendation would be very-. We have two minutes, thank you. My recommendation would be very strongly, eh, to shift this into a psychoanalytic mode. Seeing him twice a week, analyzing the narcissistic resistances systematically in the transference in combination with confronting him with his passivity and self-destructiveness, em, in terms of his work. That's most obvious, you'll have easy riding. And, more delicately, in terms of his questionable relationship with this woman. Maybe he loves, maybe there's something in for them. But, right now, it looks as, as, as if it were submerged in cotton balls. Eh, you convey the life of a man who is not living, really. And, um, I would, um, I would confront him with that. If, again, if you have an image of how a normal 42-year-old salesman might live, um, and in which you shouldn't have a bias against salesmen, because some are very normal. There is, I know there's a stereotype about salesmen. Uh, and he certainly shows that stereotype. But, but, he, to, to help him go beyond that. Uh, before we stop, what's your reaction to this, uh, conversation that we've had? 

00:55:20
DOCTOR COCKINOW I, I appreciate, um, your comment about having to, getting off this fence between supportive and, and analytic. I, I think that's where I'm stuck, because I'm trying to interpret, but I don't feel I'm interpreting from a place that we have a relationship. 

00:55:35
OTTO KERNBERG (crosstalk)Yeah, yes, you, you don't, you don't have the feels to operate, I agree. 

00:55:40
DOCTOR COCKINOW And so we want, we, I, I, I, I mean, it's been useful for me to, um, to understand how I'm on this fence, and I think I have to take the, the motion to either push us one side or the other. 

00:55:50
OTTO KERNBERG Have you had any supervision on this case before? 

00:55:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW Yes. 

00:55:55
OTTO KERNBERG Is what I'm saying in consonance with the other supervision, or not really? 

00:55:55
DOCTOR COCKINOW Um, they have not, um, no, they have not, um, recommended moving. They, it's been, kind of, stick, stick with it, um, allow time to develop the relationship, um, try not to make assumptions about his, you know, what's motivating him. Get more detail. 

00:56:20
OTTO KERNBERG Okay. I, eh, yeah, there is in, then, indeed a difference in that approach and what I'm saying, because I don't think that these things get solved with time, that relationship develops slowly out of time. Time can be used for destructive purposes as well as for constructive ones. This is a man who looks as if he has lost years with nothing, and he may do the same with his psychotherapy. In fact, that may be an unconscious triumph over you. Very dangerous to him. 

00:56:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW I, I, I sense that very much. 

00:56:50
OTTO KERNBERG (crosstalk)Yeah, okay. 

00:56:50
DOCTOR COCKINOW What you're saying. 

00:56:50
OTTO KERNBERG Um, we have to stop. I wanted to thank you for presenting this case. I appreciate very much your straightforwardness, clear, clarity, which I believe has permitted me to do work also. 

00:57:05
DOCTOR COCKINOW Thank you. 

00:57:05
OTTO KERNBERG Thanks, okay.
