FIRST ANNUAL CONFERENCE 

00:00:45
DR.GARY LANDRETH Thank you and good morning. Good morning. 

00:00:50
AUDIENCE Good Morning. 

00:00:50
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Ahh! Whoo, I thought for a minute I was in trouble that you had all stayed up so late you were sleeping this morning . I am delighted to, uh, to be here and I'm glad that you're here. This really is, uh, an historic occasion today. Um, it's been, um, in some ways slow in developing but in other ways very rapid in its movement to reach this point today. Um, and it's rewarding and, uh, a good feeling to see so many people , uh, in one state interested in Play Therapy and thus interested in the child's world. Um, and I know you all to be a group of people interested in the child's world or you wouldn't be here, today. Um, and when I start thinking about the child's world, I always think about some of the delightful little children that I know about and some of their happenings, um, one in particular. A, a, a little boy in first grade, his first day in first grade, he came rushing home. His parents were interested in what his first day had been like for him. And, uh, so they were chatting with him and the father said, "Well son, what is your first-grade teacher like?'' and this little boy thought about that and he said, "well, she's pretty much like my kindergarten teacher , except, this one has a different head.'' That one has to soak in. That is basically true . We're all pretty much the same except we have different heads. Uh, there's another child that I know about. This, uh, lady had not missed a day of work, uh ever . She'd never even been late, very punctual person. And on this day , she didn't show up for work and, uh, her employer was quite concerned. A couple of hours went by and he thought, "I just must check on her," so he called home. The phone rang, someone picked it up , and this little child's voice answered, "Hello?'' And the employer said, "May I speak to your mother?'' "No.'' "Well, why can't I speak to your mother?'' "She's busy.'' "Is your father at home?" "Yes" "May I please speak to your father?" "No." "He's busy too." "Is there any other adult in your house that I could speak to?'' "Yes, a fireman." "Could I please speak to one of the firemen?" "No, they're busy too." "Is there any other adult in your house?" "Yes, a policeman." "Could I please speak to the policeman?'' "No, he's busy too." "Could you please tell me what all the adults in your house are doing that everyone is busy and no one can come to the phone?'' "They're looking for me."

DR. GARRY LANDRETH Aren't children wonderful? And we get to have wonderful experiences with them in the playroom and to experience that view that they have of life. And I was reminded of that view, uh , last month I was visiting with a friend who lives in California and uh, he and his family went through the earthquake recently. Awakened at 4:30 in the morning, uh, all the terrible noise and he wasn't quite sure how much damage had been done to his house. The lights are out, so he took his family and went out to the car and spent the rest of the night in the car in the front yard . Came daylight, he took his family and they go back inside the house to view the damage, and he's carrying his three-year-old daughter. They walked into the kitchen which is absolutely trashed out, it's just a wreck. As they walked into the kitchen , the three-year-old started saying, "Daddy, me no do, me no do!" 

00:06:05

00:06:10
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Just sure that she was going to be blamed for that.'' In thinking about speaking , uh, this morning, uh, as I came, came closer to speaking this morning, I, I realized there were, were going to be a lot of people here, uh, who have studied with me. And, um, I, I have felt a bit apprehensive as I pondered what I could possibly say that would be new and interesting to you. Um, and I finally concluded that nothing I say may be new or interesting to you, and I decided to share with you some of my current thoughts on making contact with children in the play therapy relationship and how I think we may make a difference in children's lives . And then I would like to conclude by looking at the future of play therapy. In this play therapy process, we come together with a child for a season of shared understanding and acceptance. Now this season of being together in the playroom , to me is a truly exciting time together, made so by the singular specialness of the child. Just as snowflakes are wonderfully distinctive, so too each child is a special creation to behold. This very special uniqueness of a child is just as exciting to behold and ponder as is a bright star in the sky. And Ralph Waldo Emerson's speculation about the stars should cause us to consider how we see this relationship with children and how we see children. He wrote that, "If the constellation of stars appeared only once in a thousand years..." Imagine that . You'd go out and every night you'd look up it'd be black, there'd be no stars, but once in every thousand years, the constellation of stars would appear . "Imagine," he wrote, "what an exciting event that would be , but because they are there every night, we barely give them a look," and as I thought about that, I thought, I wonder what it would be like if you were with one child only once in your entire lifetime in the playroom. How you would view that child if you were with the child only once in your entire lifetime in the playroom. My what an exciting happening that would be. I would like to approach each of my experiences with a child with that same sense of wonder as the child plays out his or her life in our relationships together in the playroom. Recently I received tremendous confirmation that I'm on the right track in looking to children's play for meaning . I went to a Chinese restaurant, had dinner, broke open my fortune cookie, and read, "A child's action will provide you food for thought.'' In my relationships with children, I have experienced that to be true. That the child's actions will provide great insight into the child: the child's feelings, the child's needs, the child's wants, the child's desires. The spirit of a child, it seems to me, and the child's determined effort to understand life's experiences are contained in the child's play. Sometimes the meaning of the play is quite clear as in the case of two-year-old Mark recently who kept moving all the dollhouse furniture into one room of the dollhouse. It has five rooms and each room has furniture, and every time he would come into the playroom, he would move all five rooms of furniture into one room. And then he would proceed with his play with the dollhouse and the furniture. And that was a little puzzling to me the first time I witnessed that and the second time. And then it became clear that this had real meaning to him in terms of perhaps some reality in his life, and indeed it was a part of the reality of his life. He lived in a one-room efficiency apartment. And so it was important to him to replicate that experience. At other times, the meaning in the child's play is obscure as in the case of four-year-old Jessica whose mother asked me at what age she should tell Jessica who her real father is. And I said, is there some reason why at age four you're concerned about that? And she said, "Well, she keeps coming up to me and she'll put her arm beside my arm, and I'm real fair-skinned as you can see and she's kind of dark. She looks kind of Hawaiian," the mother said, "because she takes after her natural father. And I know she must be wondering who her real father is because she keeps doing that .'' And the mom was concerned about some other things, not sleeping well at night, not eating well. And in the playroom, this four-year-old would take an airplane and play with the airplane in the context of a little doll figure with the airplane. And there would always be a crash and the plane would always burn. And she would act it out and describe it. Um, also in each session at some place in the session, she would take the little baby doll, put the doll in a box, get every car she could find in the playroom, and group all the cars around the box . And this went on, week after week, after week. And that seems rather obscure, but perhaps becomes much more concrete when I tell you that, uh, this four-year-old was sitting in the pediatrician's office with mom who was holding her four-month old baby sister in her lap and the four-month-old baby sister suddenly could not breathe. And in just a matter of seconds, it went from that to desperate, and uh, mom as she described it, she said, "before anybody in the office could even react, she died in my arms. And she just turned this dark blue color.'' They were preparing to leave the physician's office and mom said to the four-year-old, "your sister won't be coming home with us. She's going to go to Heaven to be with Jesus," and the four-year-old said, "Is she going to fly in an airplane?'' Do you see the connection now with the plane and in this child's mind, what had happened to her baby sister was like being burned. You turn dark; things turn dark when they burn. And I'm absolutely convinced the child at four years of age had no interest whatsoever in who her natural father was. When she would put her arm beside her mom, she saw herself getting darker, and darker. And so what's approaching? Death is approaching like she saw her baby sister turn dark and die and didn't come home. So sometimes the play may be rather obscure. How can such children as these share their experiences with us if not through their play? I think most completely through play children are able to communicate to us their world. Some children are trying desperately to be heard , but it seems to me they most often feel as though they are trapped in dark and frightening places, and so they play. As did the 15,000 children in Dachau prison in Nazi Germany and only 100 of those 15,000 children survived that prison. As all those children faced death, they went about the business of children, playing. They drew pictures of butterflies and enchanted forests of the freedom that can only be experienced in play. How shall we relate to children who struggle to cope with life? The answer I think lies in this poem, "I tried to teach my child from books, he gave me only puzzled looks . I tried to teach my child from words, they passed him by often heard. Despairingly I turned aside, how shall I teach this child I cried. Into my hands he placed the key , come he said, play with me." Being with children in a play therapy relationship is a deeply, and often for me, profoundly humbling experience. I often feel overwhelmed by what some children have experienced, by the depth of the pain and hurt that they have endured, by the awesomeness of what they face in their life, by the complexity of their life relationships, by the terrible shattering of their childhood. The play therapy experience with children is humbling because I do not have answers to their problems. Frustrating to me because I sometimes feel powerless to help, but these are my needs, not the child's. When life is seemingly out of control, children need us to be with them, not necessarily to solve their problem but to experience that part of their life with them. I was reminded of that two years ago driving through the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. Have any of you ever driven through the Rocky Mountains in Colorado? You driven under some of those huge signs that say, "runaway truck ramp ahead?" It does make you start thinking , why that might be needed. And the reason that's needed is because those huge tractor trailer rigs often burn out their brakes going down the mountain, and they're out of control, and they need a place of safety to escape. And there's this runaway truck ramp that goes up the side of the mountain and slows them down in the process , and they can be saved. And as I drove under one of those runaway truck ramps, I was reminded of a story I had read recently just prior to that trip about two tractor trailer rigs and their drivers who were good friends going through the Rocky Mountains. And the driver in front saw in his rearview mirror the rig in the back getting much too close and coming on too fast and he realized what had happened. His brakes are gone. And so he sped up to keep from being crashed into and he matched the speed of the truck that was out of control behind him. But then he quickly realized, this won't do. Up ahead, a few miles, there is a terrible triple-s crook in the road that we won't be able to negotiate at this speed. And so he took it upon himself to bring both rigs under control. He began to apply the brakes , and he allowed the rig behind him to just nudge up against the back of his rig. He began to apply the brakes more. They're still careening down the mountainside virtually out of control. And he is desperately trying to save both of them. And just as they went into the beginning of this triple double s-curve. He was able to bring both rigs to a stop. He was later told, that can't be done. You cannot use the brakes of one tractor rig to stop two. It won't stand the pressure, but he did it. And as I thought about that, I thought there are times in children's lives when they feel out of control, and in the playroom it seems that they are virtually out of control in our presence. And I think we should be like the tractor trailer truck rig in front. We apply enough limits to help bring this situation under control, not to solve the problem perhaps, but to go careening down the mountainside with the child to experience that with them fully, to know what that is like. I cannot prevent pain and hurt in a child's life, but I can help soften the blow. I cannot change what the child faces in his or her life , but I can be with the child as fully as I am capable as the child moves toward confronting fearful experiences in life. I cannot make the child's life relationships less complex and more nurturing , but I can be consistent and predictable in my behavior and genuinely compassionate in my caring. I cannot undo experiences that have shattered children's childhoods, but I can establish the kind of relationship in which children feel safe enough to play and thus to regain their childhood in the safety of the play relationship. In this relationship, children can experience being in control of the happenings in their play and thus in control of that part of their life. Before I go any further in exploring the relationship with you, as you came in the room, you were each handed three pieces of paper. Would you take those out now? 

00:22:30
[sil.] 

00:22:35
DR. GARRY LANDRETH They're in your packets. There are three pieces of paper, small squares of paper in your packets. Would you take those out? 

00:22:50
[sil.] 

00:22:55
DR. GARRY LANDRETH If there's someone near you who does not have three small pieces of paper, would you hand them three small pieces of paper if you have some extras. It's important that everyone have three pieces of paper. I invite you now, to think about what is important or helpful to children that you do. And would you write on each of those three pieces of paper, one thing that you do with children that you consider to be perhaps one of the most important things you do. So that when you finish you'll have three of the things that you consider to be most important that you do with children and write one on each piece of paper. 

00:23:45
[sil.] 

00:23:45
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Things that you do that are important or most helpful to children 

00:23:55
[sil.] 

00:23:55
DR. GARRY LANDRETH These do not have to be lengthy discourses, could be a phrase, a word that will remind you of what you do that you consider to be helpful and important in your relationships with children. 

00:24:30
[sil.] 

00:24:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Anyone need more time? OK. Would you look over those three, and if you could only do two of those things with children, which one would you select as being the least necessary or the least helpful of those three? Out of that three, I want you to select one of those three that is the least helpful or the least necessary, although they're all important, if you could only keep two of them which two would you keep, which one would you choose to eliminate and would you now take that one that you've chosen and tear it up. 

00:25:15
[sil.] 

00:25:15
DR. GARRY LANDRETH You now have two things you do with children in play therapy you think are helpful and necessary. I would like for you to select of those two, which one you think is the least helpful or necessary, and tear it up. 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:50
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Now would you look very carefully at what remains? Would you look very carefully at what remains, what you have written there and what that means to you. What does that mean to you that you have left in your hand? Whatever is left, that is what you should be doing most with children in play therapy. Are you? Is what you're holding in your hand, where your energy is focused is that what you're trying most to do most of the time you are with children? I hope so because you have identified that as being the most important thing you can do with children and the play therapy that you establish is dependent on that variable that you're holding in your hand. The play therapy relationship is a universal place of safety for children. Again much like the safety of going down the mountainside careening together, but knowing there is a runaway truck ramp there, a place of safety. And I think in children's play, their play for them is like that runaway truck ramp, a place of safety to escape into. The fox in "The Little Prince" talked about that feeling of safety. How many of you have read "The Little Prince"? Ah, not enough. For those of you that haven't read the story, it's a delightful story about a little prince who comes from another planet to the earth and he's in search of experiences. He meets a fox and the fox begs the little prince to establish a relationship with him and in the process of establishing that relationship , he tries to convince the little prince of the importance of relationships. The fox talks about establishing ties, and I substitute the word "relationship." But in one of their conversations, the fox says to the little prince, "Other peoples' footsteps drive me deeper into my burrow to escape." You see it's a fearful thing to hear a hunter's footsteps and so the fox scurries into the burrow as deeply as he possibly can. Then the fox says, "but your footsteps will call me forth out of my burrow," will call me forth and I would like for my experiences with children, I would like to be like that. I would like to conduct myself in such a way with a child that the inner child feels called forth to come forward and I think that ways in relationships where they feel truly accepted and safe. Where their uniqueness is prized, where their will is affirmed, where their strengths are identified and appreciated, where their rejection of the play therapist is understood and not taken personally, where there fears are approached with great tenderness, where their joy is experienced by the play therapist with excitement. Children cannot change or grow in those areas where what they experience emotionally, what they live with cognitively, and what they encounter perceptually are not accepted. Children are not free to change or grow when the threat of external evaluation is present. Our acceptance allows children to express the total person they are, to be real. And although many of you have read "The Velveteen Rabbit", I would like to call you back to "The Velveteen Rabbit" at this point because that question came up between the little velveteen rabbit and the skin horse as they were lying there together. And the little velveteen rabbit had seen live rabbit outside hopping and he suddenly realized, "I can't do that,'' and he began to ponder, "how do you become real?" And so he asked the skin horse who was old and wise and had lived through generations of children in the home. "What is real?'' asked the rabbit one day when they were lying side by side. "Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick out handle?" "Real isn't how you're made,'' said the Skin Horse, "it's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but really loves you, then you become real." "Does it hurt?'' asked the Rabbit. "Sometimes,'' said the skin horse for he was always truthful. "When you're real though, you don't mind being hurt." "Does it happen all at once like being wound up or bit by bit?'' asked the Rabbit. "Well, it doesn't happen all at once," said the Skin Horse. "You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily, or who have sharp edges, or have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are real, most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out, and you get loose in the joints and very shabby." Sort of like play therapists. "But those things don't matter at all because once you are real, you can't be ugly except to people who don't understand.'' The power we have, each one of us, to touch a child and in the process of that touching, to bring forth, to call forth the realness of the child. And then once a child has been real, they can't be ugly except to people who don't understand. In this relationship with us, children discover what being safe feels like. Once that feeling of safety has been experienced, it cannot be taken away. And so children revisit the comfort and familiarity of that inner feeling as they live out the inner rhythm of their lives in our presence. In the play therapy process, children often establish rituals in their play . Rituals that become a place where they feel comfortable. Rituals are a means of establishing bonds within oneself and with another person. They are what make the relationship unique. Every child in play therapy I think creates a set of rituals that have a distinctive rhythm to fit the relationship. Even in the midst of highly aggressive behavior, there is a rhythm there. For the child who is very quiet and withdrawn, there is a rhythm there. In "The Little Prince'', the fox talks about the importance of rituals in relationships. The fox and the little prince had made contact, had begun to build their relationship. The little prince went away. The next day, the little prince came back. "It would have been better to come back at the same hour," said the fox, "if for example you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances, but if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you. One must observe the proper rights." "What is a right?" asked the little prince. "They're what make one day different from other days , one hour different from other hours,'' said the fox. And I think it is the right of the play therapy relationship that makes this a truly different day for the child. This conversation between the little prince and the fox speaks loudly of the importance of being consistent and predictable in the play therapy relationship. We also, every one of us in this room have our own rituals, places of comfort. Let me demonstrate this to you. Take your hands, put them together. Unclasp, put your hands together again. Notice which thumb is on top. Open your hands up and make that thumb now come out underneath the other one. It doesn't feel comfortable , does it? Now open your hands up and without thinking, put them together and that feels comfortable. We return to our places of comfort. Fold your arms across your chest, unfold, fold again. Notice which arm is next to your body and which one is away from your body and open up and reverse that. 

00:36:05
[sil.] 

00:36:10
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Now without thinking, fold your arms across your chest and your returned places of comfort. We all have our rituals of comfort that we return to and I think we should be reminded of that, that that is also true for children. We unconsciously return to our places of comfort , but new places of comfort can be established when the individual's perception is changed. And perceptions are changed as a result of meaningful relationships. The fox described this kind of change when he said to the little prince, "Look, you see the grain fields down yonder? I do not eat bread; wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me and that is sad, but you have the hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that'd be, wi-, will be when you have tamed me. The grain which is also golden will bring me back the thought of you and I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat." A powerful description of a change in perception, a different view of the world now. What a wonderful description of the healing power of a relationship to alter a person's perception of the world. And in the process, that which had little meaning takes on new meaning and it becomes significant . When I'm with a child in a play therapy rela-, relationship, I want to anticipate this child's inner rhythm and to be sensitive to the emotional movement of the child in the flow of the play therapy process. 

00:38:05

00:38:05
DR. GARRY LANDRETH In the midst of the child's behavior which may sometimes be bizarre, seemingly out of control, deliberately provocative; in the midst of that , there is a person tapping out a message. "Does anyone hear me? Does anyone notice I'm hurting? Does anyone care?'' One person willing to hear and to respond can confirm a child's existence at that moment. At such times I'm reminded of a terrible mine disaster that occurred in the Midwest several years ago. There was a terrible explosion, several hundred feet underground and 12 miners were trapped deep underground. Above ground, no one knew whether anyone down there had survived the blast and the cave in, but one of those 12 miners had been working in a little side shaft. And the rest of the mine collapsed except for that little side shaft and he was protected. He was safe for the moment. Above ground no one knew if anyone was alive, but they began the necessary rescue operation and this miner who had survived had been through other mine disasters and he knew what they were doing. "They will come for me,'' and so he sat down to wait. Three days went by, no sound. He began to get frightened. He had been on other mine disasters where eventually not able to reach the level of the destruction underground, they had closed the mine shaft off and gone about their lives. And his fear was they will do that here and he began to desperately search for some way to let the people above ground know that he was alive. And he picked up a hammer , through his section of the mine shaft ran a pipe and he began to periodically bang on that pipe, tapping out his message to the world, "I'm here. Does anyone hear me? Does anyone know I'm alive?'' Hour after hour , he'd tap out that message, sending it out to the world. Five days went by, no response. Seven days went by , no response. Nine days went by, he his desperate. No message back, and he's still banging on that pipe, sending out his message. On the tenth day, he picked up his hammer, he banged on the pipe and one of the rescue workers had gotten close to the other end of that pipe and he heard in the midst of his digging this faint tap in that pipe, and he knew instantly what it was. And he grabbed his shovel and he banged on that pipe, sending a message down through the pipe to the trapped miner. Can you sense the flood of relief in that miner who's been underground for 10 days, tapping out his message, "I'm here. Does anybody here me? Does anybody know I'm alive?'' And he suddenly after 10 days hears a faint tap back that confirms his existence that he knows they know. And I think children are like that when they're touched by our tap back , it releases this tremendous flood of relief, "I've been heard, I exist." William James wrote that there is no more f-, or could be no more fiendish punishment than that an individual would be born into this world, go through his life, have no one respond to him, he would not know whether or not he existed. How could he? Ponder that. If day after day, no one responded to you, no one looked at you, no one touched you, no one answered your questions, no one handed you anything, no one asked anything of you. You would not know whether or not you existed. Folks, every one of us has the power to confirm in another person their existence . The healing power of touching another person's life and in that process communicating caring for the person was so graphically illustrated just a few months ago in a news story released by CNN TV. Some of you may have seen it. An 87-year-old woman lay in a deep coma for months and the family and the physicians finally after several months decided to disconnect the life machinery. And a young intern was called in to assist and in the process of disconnecting one of the tubes from her arm, as he lifted her arm up to disconnect the tube, he instinctively began to stroke her arm, just an intuitive thing out of compassion for this lady. And as he rubbed her arm, her eyes opened and he continued to rub her arm and her mouth opened and she said, "I didn't know anybody cared." I think there're children who wonder, "Does anybody care?" We all have the power of touch. We can touch with our words, we can touch with our eyes , we can touch with our facial expressions. We can touch a child with our heart. Helen Keller wrote in her autobiography about the significance a loving, compassionate relationship can have in facilitating a life-changing process in her words, "Once I knew the depth where no hope was and darkness lay on the face of all things. Then love came and set my life free. Once I fretted and beat myself against the wall that shut me in. My life was without a past or future and death a consummation devoutly to be wished. But a little word, a little word, from the fingers of another fell into my hands that clutched at emptiness and my heart leaped up with the rapture of living. I do not know the meaning of the darkness, but I have learned the overcoming of it." What I'm trying to describe in a caring relationship in which I am fully experiencing being with a child, with no intent to solve this child's problem, what I'm trying to describe there may best be seen through a child's eyes . Six-year-old Shelly was in the first grade. She lived a few blocks from school. Mother showed her the route to school and really pressed home to her, "when school is out, you come straight home." That message she'd really gotten through to her. Mom had just drilled that in, "come straight home after school." So it was understandable that one afternoon, Shelly's mom was concerned when Shelly was a few minutes late getting home from school. Mom paced the driveway for ten minutes , no Shelly. She continued to fret and worry , and after 20 minutes, Mom is almost frantic and then Shelly appeared down the street and Mom's reaction changed now to anger. She grabbed Shelly, she yelled at her, and then she finally asked Shelly for an explanation. "What have you been doing?" And Shelly told her that on the way home , she, as she was walking by Sally's house, Sally was in the front yard crying because she had lost her doll . And mom said ``Oh. And you stopped to find Amy's doll for her'', and Shelly said, "No mommy. I stopped to help Amy cry." Children see the world with their hearts, and so it does not occur to them to solve the problem of a lost doll. They respond spontan-, spontaneously to a broken heart. Most adults see the world with their minds and so focus on fixing the problem. The fox spoke to this point when he said to the little prince as they were about to end their relationship . The fox said, "I want to give you a special gift before you go on about the rest of your travels." And the special gift was this: "Words are the source of misunderstandings," the Fox said. "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly what is invisible, or what is essential is invisible to the eye." It is only with the heart that one can see rightly. Play therapy is a heart to heart relationship. When two people are relating on an emotional heart to heart basis, everyone is equal. Ponder that. When you relate to a child on a heart to heart basis , we are equal. Size is unimportant. Also what I know intellectually is unimportant when we relate on a heart to heart basis . I think this is true in play therapy. In play therapy, children play with great intensity. They're involved with their hearts and their spirits. I was reminded of that, uh, this little boy named Mark. Mark was seven-years-old, and he played with such intensity in the playroom. He came in and setup this scene of, uh, a stagecoach driving across the west somewhere and it's attacked by the Indians. And he pulled up his chair beside the play therapist, handed the play therapist some of the weapons he had collected. He had every gun and knife in the room and he handed the gun to the play therapist and he's describing all these Indians. There were thousands of Indians coming at them and he looked at the play therapist and he handed him the gun and said, "Do you think you can shoot `em?" And the play therapist said, "Well I don't know Mark.'' And the child's eyes got that big around, he said, "Good grief man! Don't lose heart now, or we're lost!''

DR. GARRY LANDRETH That same little boy came in one morning, he was usually very active, very verbal, and, uh, aggressive also. That was one of the reasons he had been referred. Only this particular day, he's just not himself. He's different, he's moping around, and sort of muttering to himself, could hardly understand what he was saying. Now and then you'd hear, "this morning," and then later you'd hear, "my mother.'' "This morning'' and he spied the bulb-bulb(ph) and he started hitting on the bulb-bulb(ph), but that didn't seem to be satisfying enough. So he picked up a wooden mallet, and he just beat the daylights out of that bulb-bulb(ph). So much so that he just physically was tired. He's resting his chin on the top of bulb-bulb(ph), gasping for breath, the mallet's dangling in his hand there, and you could just see, almost literally, the light bulb go on above his head. He thought of something. He looked at that mallet, he said, "This morning, my mother... Would you sell me this mallet?''

DR. GARRY LANDRETH Children see the world differently than we do. When I'm with a child in a relationship, there is always, it seems to me an unspoken inner struggle to touch what is untouchable in this child. To accomplish this, I have learned to appreciate and enjoy each child's quietness. If I am to be successful in my effort to make contact with the child, I must be still within myself and see the child. I must be still and listen to the child. I must be still and make contact with the imagination of the child. I must be still and follow the lead of the child. I must be still and experience this child. I must be still within myself and touch the hidden person of the child. Whether or not I'm able to do that will depend on what I see and what I'm aware of in myself and in this child. What do you see when you're with a child? I have a test for you. Would you turn the overhead on please? Would you look at that, and you have 30 seconds to decide what it is. Based on your response within 30 seconds , we will determine whether or not you are allowed to get a raise this coming year. Well, many of you've probably already seen something. What do you see? A fetus. How many of you see a fetus of some kind? That's a very typical response. Um, let me say to you that what is there is not a fetus. So let me shift your perception a bit. If you'll turn the overhead , yes, coming around some more, all the way there. Now, I have shifted your field of vision. And what do you see? Many of you are going to say a fetus on its side. Um, well what you see there is a very common thing that you see almost every day . Many of you have one of these in your home, and you love them. What do you see? I heard the answer. A dog. Yes, it is a picture of a dog. Every one stop real quickly and get in touch with what you just felt as soon as this went off. What did you feel as soon as that was turned off? Lost, frustrated , confused. Maybe a little angry? Whatever you were feeling there, that is the way hundreds of thousands of children in this country feel every day in classrooms. When the rest of the class sees it, and the teacher goes on and they don't, they feel the way you just felt. Well it's important that you see the dog. Could we have the light on again? Let me, uh, help you to focus on the dog by saying to you, if you will look right in the, uh, right in the center, right here. This is a quiet dog that has gone out to lie down in the middle of this quiet rug, this oval rug. And the dog has gone out and is lying in the center, and as the dog begins to lie down, he stretches up the rug around him. That's this right here. And here is the dog, he gets a big black ear, and a big black ear, and the (inaudible ). Here's his tail, he's lying down curled up. Here's his tail, here's his butt, here's his back, here's his shoulder, here's a big black ear, here's a big black ear, here the, you don't actually see eyes; you see a shadow where the eyes are. Here's his muzzle, the tip of his nose lying on top of his tail here. How many of you see the dog? Many more and if you still don't see the dog at the break, you come up and I'll show you the dog because I do want you to see the dog. But there is a lesson for this in us folks, for us folks. Perhaps we see what we go looking for based on our experiences with other children, based on our life experiences; we see what we go looking for. I would like to begin with each child afresh, anew, not to expect anything but to see what this child has to reveal to me, to show to me. And I've, I think been most successful in achieving that by looking into the child's play for the meaning. And once you see the meaning in the play , you cannot not see it. Much like once you see the dog, you can't not see the dog. If I could have the light on again please Nancy. You immediately see the dog, and if I come back a year from now and stand before you and show you this picture, you will see the dog immediately because now you're open to that. Thank you. When I'm with children, I would like to be the kind of person my friend Paddington is. If I could introduce you to my friend Paddington. Paddington doesn't look like much. He's not very impressive, he's not very big, he has no authority. He does not own much. A Ross Perot he's not. He doesn't have an important position. Measured by the standards of many people, Paddington is not a success. Paddington does possess though those qualities that make a difference in the lives of children. He is a good listener. Paddington never criticizes. He projects warmth. He looks comfortable with himself. Paddington is resilient, he bounces back from life's blows. If I happen to drop him accidentally, he bounces back. Paddington never makes hurtful remarks Paddington has never interrupted me. Paddington accepts me always as I am that day. Paddington sits on my desk and therefore influences me every day. Each of us is capable of influencing others and thus to make a difference in their lives. Influence is the constant, silent, radiation of who you are. Like Paddington, I want to be fully present for the child and to be accepting of the personhood of the child. When I am with a child, it does not occur to me to want to change this child. Rather than focusing on this child's problem or deficiencies, I think we should look deep into the child's heart for profound possibilities. We should take to heart the words of Rousseau who wrote, "Childhood is not a time set aside for adults to finish God's work.

DR. GARRY LANDRETH "Childhood is a time important in itself, a time when the behavior of the child is appropriate to the demands of his needs and his world. Whenever one looks at a child, one sees a whole human being." Ponder that, a whole human being, not an incomplete person. "A whole human being properly put together for this particular time in life." I think the human organism knows what it needs and is always moving toward health. Within every child there is an organismic wisdom that enables a child to make appropriate choices and to move toward health. Therefore the most caring thing I think the play therapist can do is not to intervene. We must wait for children to discover themselves. And it is in this process of the play therapy relationship that children are allowed to become the person they are. And in that process, I trust the child to take our relationship to where the child needs to be. The spirit of a child is contained in the child's play, therefore, I want to hear what the child hears, I want to see what the child sees, I want to touch what this child touches, and I want to feel what the child feels. A few years ago, late one night, I found myself pondering the fact that most of what I know, I've learned from children. So I sat down and I began to write what I had learned about me from my relationships with children. When I had finished that list it was about 2:00 in the morning. I was surprised to find that I had a list of principles for relationships with children that have come to govern my life with children. And I would like to share that list with you. I am not all-knowing ; therefore I shall not even attempt to be in the presence of children. I want to be more accepting of the child in me, therefore I will with wonder and awe allow children to illuminate my world. I know so little about the complex intricacies of childhood; therefore I will allow children to teach me. I learned best from and impacted most by my own personal struggles, therefore I will join with children in their struggles. I sometimes need a refuge; therefore I will provide a refuge for children. I like it too when I am fully accepted as the person I am, therefore I will strive to experience and appreciate the person of the child. I make mistakes. They are a declaration of the way I am, human, infallible. Therefore I will be tolerant of the humanness of children. It feels good to be an authority, to provide answers. Therefore, I shall need to work hard to protect children from me. I am more fully me when I feel safe therefore I will be consistent in my interactions with children. I am the only person who can live my life. Therefore I will not attempt to rule a child's life. I have learned most of what I know from experiencing. Therefore I will allow children to experience. I cannot make children's make children's hurts, and fears, and disappointments go away. Therefore I will soften the blow. I experience fear when I am vulnerable therefore world of the vulnerable child. Since this is an historic occasion, I'd just like to shift gears right now and share with you where I think the field of play therapy is headed. What does the future hold for play therapy? I have 13 things that I thought of that the field of play therapy holds. One: the popularity of play therapy will increase dramatically. Two: the number of counselor education, psychology, and social work programs offering play therapy training in universities will double in the near future. Three: The use of group play therapy will grow rapidly. Four: play therapy will become a routine part of elementary school counselors' repertoires. Five: we will break out of the once a week session format and meet children's needs more immediately by condensing the time between sessions and having play therapy sessions twice a week and even every day. Six: there will be a tremendous emphasis in the literature and through workshops on the development and utilization of specific play therapy techniques for specific problems and specific groups of children. A prescriptive diagnostic approach that will focus more on the problem to the exclusion of the person of the child, and I fear that. Seven: we will go through a period when the pressure to fix a child's problem will outweigh the need to understand the child. We're already experiencing tremendous pressure from insurance companies to solve the problem in five sessions. Eight: play therapy will increasingly be used with adults. Nine: filial therapy will become a major force in the training of parents in this country. Ten: the dimensions of the play therapy process will be utilized to transcend culturally encapsulating bombs that interfere with communication and acceptance between people. Eleven: elementary school teachers will be trained in basic play therapy skills to be used in the classrooms. Twelve: Innovative elementary schools will have playrooms staffed by trained paraprofessional volunteers. Children who are stressed will have the opportunity to choose to go to this playroom for five minutes of emotional release whenever the child decides they need it. Thirteen: Texas will lead the nation in APT membership. Texas will lead the nation in play therapy training and the Texas association for play therapy will be the largest state branch in the nation.

DR. GARRY LANDRETH The future of play therapy depends on people like you and organizations such as this Texas association for play therapy. From where I stand and based on what I know, about many of you in this audience I can say with great enthusiasm, play therapy is in superb hands in the state of Texas and I believe that because I know you. As we struggle together to foster the growth of the Texas Association for Play Therapy and by so doing to help to make this world a safe place for children, perhaps we should take a lesson from the past about how to go about doing that. Eighty-five year old Nadine Stair, when looking back over her life wrote what I'm about to share with you. And I think there's a great message in how we should perhaps change what we're doing in our lives so we can do a better job in the future. Eighty-five year old Nadine Stair wrote this, "If I had my life to live over, I'd dare to make more mistakes next time. I'd relax. I would limber up. I would be sillier than I had been this trip. I would take fewer things seriously. I would take more chances. I would climb more mountains, and I would swim more rivers. I would eat more ice cream and less beans. I would perhaps have more actual troubles, but I'd have fewer imaginary ones. You see I'm one of those people who lived sensibly and sanely hour after hour, day after day. Oh, I've had my moments, and if I had to do it all over again, I'd have more of them. In fact, I'd try to have nothing else, just moments, one after another. Instead of living so many years ahead of each day. I've been one of those persons who never goes anywhere without a thermometer, a hot water bottle, and a rain coat, and a parachute. If I had it to do over again I would travel lighter than I have this trip. If I had my life to live over I would start barefoot earlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall. I would go to more dances, I would ride more merry-go-rounds, I would pick more daisies.'' Eighty-five year old Nadine Stair has a message for us. In the play therapy relationship, children are creating the future. Therefore we stand on the edge of tomorrow in our relationships with children. What do these relationships hold? I have no idea, but I do know who makes the difference in releasing the emotional healing power of the play therapy relationship. I believe it is people like you who love children and have committed your lives to helping them that makes a difference in children's lives. You give priceless gifts to children , you give courage, you give love, self-esteem, kindness, direction, you give time, you give yourself. For the children, I thank you. Someday, at the end of this earthly life, you will stand and be asked, "How did you help the children?'' and the answer from the children will be "When I cried, you dried my tears. When I was frightened, you quieted me. When I felt alone, you comforted me. When my heart was broken, you loved me. When I was excited, you listened. When I fell, you picked me up. When I stretched out my hand, you were there. When I marveled at God's creations, you understood. I would like to express in closing what coming here and being with you this morning has been like for me, and words seem so inadequate in doing that. So I'd just like to express that feeling to you in a way that an eight-year-old little girl expressed it knowing that this was to be her last session in the playroom. She was struggling with what that experience had meant to her and she said to the play therapist, "Coming here has been like, oh, it's like, you know when you eat a piece of buttered toast, and the butter runs all the way down here in the corner, and you eat all around that corner and you save that corner til last cuz it's best. Coming here is like that corner.'' And coming here and being with you all this morning has been like that corner. Thank you.
