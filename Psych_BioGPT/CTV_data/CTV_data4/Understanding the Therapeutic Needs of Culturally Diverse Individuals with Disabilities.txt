Microtraining Associates, Inc. www.emicrotraining.com (888)505-5576 Microtraining Associates Presents Understanding the Therapeutic Needs of Culturally Diverse Individuals with Disabilities Miguel E. Gallardo, Psy.D. 

00:00:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO  Thank you all for coming. There's a lot of great presentations going on simultaneously. So we appreciate you, ah, ah, taking the time to come and, ah, and visit with us today. My name is, ah, Miguel Gallardo. I'm a counseling psychologist from the University of California, Irvine. Ah, I also teach a few courses there in Department of Social Psychology. And I'm here today with, ah, Dr. Jennifer Gibson, who will introduce. 

00:00:35
JENNIFER GIBSON  Hi. Good morning. Uhm, I also too work in a counseling center at UC Irvine with Dr. Gallardo and I am an assistant director at the disability center at UC Irvine. 

00:00:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO  As you can see by the overhead, today's presentations on Understanding the Therapeutic Needs of Culturally Diverse Individual Disabilities. So what we're gonna attempt to do today is really bring together two, two really, uhm, two issues, one, of being a, a racially ethnically diverse individual. That's one issue. And the other issue is having a disability. If you examine each of those issues separately, you encounter a number of challenges and, and potential barriers for the individual. And when you bring them together, uhm, it becomes a, a sort of a simultaneous oppression if you will or a multiple or triple jeopardy as we call it. So what we're gonna do is try to provide a little bit of awareness and some knowledge but more importantly try to provide a, a foundation or a framework for the beginnings of a skill development model. Oftentimes, we do a very good job of raising the awareness and the knowledge of different issues. But we, uhm, fail, I think, at times to provide the actual skills necessary to go out and intervene. And so what I'm gonna try and talk a little bit about today a little bit later is a skill development model that Dr. Thomas Parham put forth in working in African centered way with African Americans. And I've adapted that, uhm, once already to working with the Chicano-Latino population and, ah, have found its use and also potentially working with, with the folks with disabilities. I wanted to start the presentation off with a story. Some of you in the room have heard this before. Uhm, most of you probably haven't. Are we okay? Okay. All right. Uhm, I'll ask you what, what, why I'm reading this to you when I'm through reading it to you. It's called The Malayan Wolf. The forest was my home. I live there. And I cared about it. I tried to keep it neat and clean. Then one sunny day while I was cleaning up some garbage a camper had left behind, I heard footsteps. I leaped behind a tree and saw a little girl coming down the trail, carrying a basket. I was suspicious of this little girl right away because she was dressed funny, all in red and her head covered up as she, as if she didn't want people to know who she was. Naturally I stopped to check her out. I asked who she was, where she was going, where she had come from and all of that. She gave me a song and dance about her going to her grandmother's house with a basket of lunch. She appeared to be basically an honest person. But she was in my forest, and she certainly looks suspicious with that strange getup of hers. So I decided to teach her just how serious it is to prance to the forest unannounced and dressed funny. I let her go on her way. But I ran ahead to her grandmother's house. When I saw that nice old woman, I explained my problem. And she agreed that her granddaughter needed to learn lesson all right. The old woman agreed to stay out of sight until I called her. Actually she hid under the bed. When the girl arrived, I invited her into the bedroom where I was in the bed, dressed like the grandmother. The girl came in all rosy cheeked and said something nasty about my big ears. I've been insulted before. So I made the best of it by suggesting that my big ears would help me to hear her better. Now, what I meant was I liked her and wanted to pay close attention to what she was saying. But she made another insulting crack about my bulging eyes. Now, you can see I was beginning to feel about this girl who put on such a nice front but was apparently a very nasty person. Still, I'd made it a policy to turn the other cheek. So I told her that my big eyes help me to see her better. Her next insult really got to me. I've got this problem with having big teeth. And that little girl made an insulting crack about them. I know that I should have had better control. But I leaped out from that bed and growled that my teeth would help me to eat her better. Now, let's face it. No wolf could ever eat a little girl. Everyone knows that. But that crazy girl started running around the house, screaming, me chasing her to calm her down. I've taken off the grandmother's clothes. But that only seemed to make it worse. All of a sudden, the door came crashing open and a big lumberjack is standing there with his axe. I looked at him. And all of a sudden, it came clear that I was in trouble. There was an open window behind me, and out I went. I'd like to say that that was the end of it. But that grandmother character never did tell my side of the story. Before long, the word got around that I was a mean, nasty guy. Everybody started avoiding me. I don't know about that little girl with the funny red outfit. But I didn't live happily ever after. You know the story? Why is that important? How does, how is that relevant? I think this, this story is relevant to this conference in general. But in particular to a presentation like this, where does the relevance come in? Any thoughts? Why did I read it? Yes. 

00:06:50

00:06:50
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO  Right. So you've been socialized very well. Perfect. Okay. Could anybody else? I, I think the other issue that, one, the other reason I like reading this story is because it, it also highlights how early on we, we, the socialization process begins for us. And this really carries over when we look at racially ethically diverse individuals, people with disabilities, et cetera. So not only are we being told at a very early point in our lives what we should believe, what we should think, et cetera. But once we start to internalize these beliefs, they begin to impact us, impact how we treat one another and impact how we treat other people outside of our race, outside of our ethnicity. So today, part of what we're gonna highlight are the challenges that not only racially ethnically diverse individuals face but people with disabilities as well. They have also internalized this sort of normal able bodied White Christian mentality, uhm, as individuals. And so oftentimes, as you'll see throughout the presentation that they have turned the disability and denied it in some ways and have rejected other folks with disabilities in many ways. So I think the story really highlights that we get something from one perspective, begin to believe it. And it starts at a very early age. And once we get that perspective, it's very, very hard to change. Uhm, so I wanted to start with that and provide that as a foundation for the rest of the workshop today. Uhm. I'm not gonna spend the whole lot of time defining disabilities and, uhm, and, and spend, take up some of our time doing that. We only have an hour today. So I really wanna get through some of that. But I will say that what we are going to be talking about today includes folks with physical cognitive psycho-emotional sensory disabilities. Uhm, and disabilities can be defined in, in, in a way such that, ah, the, the impairment impacts one or more life activities of this individual, okay? What I, what I wanna start in more specifically with the presentation are the three different models of disabilities, okay? The first model is called the moral model. This is important. The three models are important because we have come to understand disabilities within one of these frameworks as of people with disabilities. The moral model focuses on the defect as representing some form of sin or moral lapse, okay? Feelings of shame occur, ah, for both the individual with the disability and family members who feel responsible. The disability is perceived as a test of faith. So you can see in some ways how this can already begin to carry over into certain cultural ethnic groups who have strong spiritual religious beliefs. They may see the disability as, uhm, a form of their faith, something that past ancestors have done, et cetera. So this perspective while valid for many individuals can also be at times very detrimental. The second model is the medical model, okay, where disability represents a defect or a loss of function that resides in the individual, okay? The advantage over the moral model is it removes the notion of sin for the disability. So we're taking it from the individual as, as the individual having done something wrong or the individual's family having done something wrong to now there's just, there's a, a biological genetic defect in some way. The medical model is, is responsible for many technological advances. Again, while, while in some ways valid, it's also very limiting, okay? The model that we are moving towards and the model that we want to empower people with disabilities with is, is what we call the minority model, okay? There's a big shift between the moral model, the medical model to the minority model. Disability is seen as an external problem involving an environment that fails to accommodate the needs of the individual disabilities perpetuated with negative social attitudes. So it really takes the sort of blaming the individual and looking at sort of the social problems that exist. So we look at the environment the individual exists in as the problem as opposed to the individual, similarities between the experiences of individuals who are disabled and those of other minority groups. So again, you see the transgression from blaming the individual, having a, a genetic biological defect to looking at a more of a social perspective and, and looking at, ah, incorporating folks with disabilities as a minority group, okay, as a culture onto themselves. The minority model is also called the social model, okay? Okay. Turn over to identity. 

00:11:45
Providing Care to Persons with Disabilities Jennifer Gibson, Ph. D. 

00:11:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO  Dr. Gibson's now gonna talk a little bit of identity development within the, the culture. 

00:11:50
JENNIFER GIBSON  Well, I have worked with, in a disability center for 20 years and have, uhm, very little on identity development in disability. So, I thought this would be a good time to look into how do folks with disabilities come to their own identity. So, so I have created a model focusing on people with physical disabilities, lifelong disabilities. The first stage, first of all, I compare my model to (inaudible ). Well. Okay. The first stage is a passive awareness. This is from birth until whenever. Hopefully by the time you're an adolescent, you'll be moving out of it. Uhm, people, people born with disability have no role model of a person with a disability. They had their medical needs met, but you had, beyond that, the family usually does not discuss psychosocial needs. They deny it. So the disability often becomes a silent member of the family. Don't talk about it, what we notice there, uhm, the child doesn't want, the child wants to be as inconspicuous as possible. They know they stand out. So they tend to, they tend to become very obedient and become co-dependent within the family. They stay away from attention. They have enough of it when they walk out of the home. So they don't want more. Uhm, and because people with disabilities are socialized in our society, we choose to hide away from disability. This, I think goes very well with stage 1 (inaudible ). According to (inaudible ), they, they, they deny themselves, their identity and take on the dominant culture. And in this case, the dominant culture from my model is able bodied. Okay, okay to page 2. Well, is it, well, there's, uhm, you wake up. One day, you wake up. And you realize, "I really do have a disability and people do view me differently." This happens and often coincides with late adolescence, early adulthood, and into a most, begin dating and begin trying to find a partner. And for people with disabilities, they can be difficult, uhm, because of perceived perceptions. Uhm, within this stage, people with disabilities may have self hate like "Why me? Why do I have a disability? Why am I different?" and until they're very concerned with how others perceive them. So like for me, when I went to this stage, I would not walk out of my house without makeup, hair and clothes perfect. And so I had to get up at 5 a.m. I'm not a morning person and didn't go over to, so for me that phase did not last long because I just couldn't, couldn't keep getting (inaudible ). So I thought, "Screw them." And so, so often, people are so, begin thinking "I can overcome what people think of me. I will become a superman, superwoman. I can join all." But we can't. And when we figure that out, we move on hopefully. Uhm, we move on to acceptance. And this is in adulthood and could happen anywhere but usually in adulthood, uhm, they shift from being different to embracing yourself, "I'm worthy. I have value." And so you just see yourself no less or no more than any other. Your person might begin to incorporate others with disabilities into their life and may become an advocate even on disability rights. Uhm, the main thing is you begin to integrate yourself into the majority world, the abled body world. And this is very similar to stage 5 of (inaudible ). Okay. Now, I'm done, Dr. Gallardo. 

00:20:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO  What's, what's interesting about ah, Dr. Gibson's identity development model ah, for a person with a disability is, you know, she had, ah, (inaudible ) model right next to it. And so if you, if you look at the identity development of an individual from ah, a racial ethnic background, uhm, you also see initially obviously that the rejection of, of one's culture, uhm, and confusion to, uhm, ah, asking questions, increasing awareness and then acceptance, uhm, and so if you put those two things together, and I'll start talking a little bit about that now, but, uhm, the identity development of an individual from a diverse racial ethnic background who has a disability can become very confusing ah, because there is, there is not an acceptance of either culture if you will or, or where to fit in if you will. There's a, there's a rejection of, uhm, from the able bodied world, and maybe there is a rejection from the White dominant Eurocentric world as well. And so if you have, ah, ah, a Latino with a disability, that individual may not be able to go back and forth. They may be rejected by White society and may be rejected uhm, by the able body or the disabled as well, disabled culture in many ways because of their ethnic cultural background. And so I'll talk a little bit about that as we begin to move through. But, but also what's important about the identity development model that Jen, ah, Dr. Gibson just outlined is it also depends on what kind of disability the individual has. So for an individual, ah, a person with a visual impairment, what does, what does one need to, to sort of identify race, ethnicity, right, it, the, the color of one's skin, right? So if an individual, a person with a visual impairment, a visual disability cannot see color, uhm, that often might impact their identity development as a person of color, okay? For an individual who ah, maybe has a, an emotional cognitive deficit or disability of some kind, ah, a racial joke may not necessarily be ah, integrated or understood in a way and that may not be ah, be offensive to that individual but maybe very offensive to somebody else of the same race or ethnicity is that individual. So some of those things really make a difference. The type of disability makes a difference. A Congenital disabilities which are disabilities that an individual is born with, so if you're born with a disability, you're trying to simultaneously move through society and integrate both of these different identities, okay, versus an acquired disability which happens much later in one's life. Uhm, so the identity development model, I think, that she's outlined is, is, ah, really advantageous for us in understanding the, the process that one moves through with a disability while simultaneously attempting to move through the racial ethnic identity as well, okay. What I wanna highlight now a little bit is, are some, ah, some of the more ah, I guess, more initial ideas or models of, of disability from a racial ethnic perspective, the biological and cultural models, okay? These represent people of color with disabilities as a social threat and/or victim, okay? So if we look at the biological model of disability, there is something genetically wrong with people of color with disabilities. There's a defect. Ah, and so we see them as a social threat. They become a problem for us in many ways. This is a historical perspective. And as a result of that, the development of incarceration and institutionalization occurred throughout our history. If we move to the cultural model of disability, ah, it's, it's, it's almost like we perceive folks of color with disabilities in this inescapable cycle of poverty or living in these areas in which they cannot move themselves out of. And so we then see them as social victims ah, during that time period when the cultural model was taking, uhm, ah, a lot of, driving a lot of the policies and procedurally develop the head start programs, these early intervention programs for folks of, of color with disabilities. And then again, as we move from the biological, the cultural, the moral, the medical to the minority, we begin to make that shift. So if you look at the, within the biological and cultural models, the result is there's a creation of barriers that exists within the social and economic institutions of society, right, the incarceration, the institutionalization, etcetera. Majority of Latinos with disabilities live below the poverty line, okay? African-Americans with disabilities are disadvantaged, okay? So those are, these kinds of statistics are the result of those two perspectives, based on those initial perspectives, generate a lot of policies and procedures. When we move to the minority group model, okay, again it starts to begin to promote the examination of unequal power relations in society, okay? It's like the freedom model, the empowering model for people with disabilities. Ah, it redefines long held social definitions of disabilities, okay? The one limitation with, ah, the minority group model, the social model is that it focuses, it continues to focus only on one single issue. And part of that is the result of the biological and cultural models which focused on a number of or multiple issues within the individual. So we look at, we look at the minority group model. It's almost sort of we want to oppose the biological cultural models. And so what we've done to ourselves in some ways is only focused on one particular aspect. So even within the minority group model, there are still limitations in examining the issues and the challenges that people of color with disabilities have. Uhm, that's one of the, the challenges that we see within that model, okay? We move to the next slide. 

00:26:15
[sil.] 

00:26:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO  Okay. So if we look at some of the demographic changes, people with disabilities make up the wide range of identities and experiences in this culture. If you look at the majority where we are moving to the demographic changes, you are seeing that people of color are beginning to, uhm, the numbers, our, our numbers are increasing, and our presence in site has increased. So the majority of the folks with disabilities today or folks of color are beginning to move in that direction. So we need to begin to understand that. What we, what we call this transition and what we call those issues of being a person of color with a disability, simultaneous oppression, double or triple disadvantaged multiple minority or jeopardy or multiple other, okay? These are, these are terms that we're beginning to use to begin this, encompass and understand the multiple issues that these individuals begin to face, okay? The challenge become, becomes and that these issues are not necessarily always experienced simultaneously, okay? A lot of that depends on how the individual identifies themselves. And that's part of what I'll talk about a little bit later when I talk about the skill development model, is examining once identity in connecting with a client and identifying where that individual is (cough). What the norm is which Dr. Gibson talked about is the able bodied White male, heterosexual, young, financially secure and Christian individual, okay? So our, our individuals who are a woman, an African American woman with a disability is looking at normality and going "Where do I fit in? And who do I fit in with?" Okay? African and Americans and Latinos are over represented among people with chronic health conditions in the society. People of color with disabilities are more likely to have lower education, higher unemployment and lower incomes. Part of where a lot of these statistics come from again has been the more historical perspective that the problems lie within the individuals as opposed to within the society. So part of what we advocate for is, is a reexamination and looking at the, the social barriers or the social injustices that these individuals live in as the problem as opposed to the individual (cough). We also know that accessibility is less prevalent in poor areas, poor areas, disproportionate impact on people of color. So those individuals who are of color with a disability are again challenged in many ways because accessibility, health care, et cetera are limited to those individuals. Another challenge, one more thing on that slide, you know? Sorry about that (cough). The, the idea of this sort of not experience simultaneously the, the, the idea of identity development of color, disability, gender, sexuality, whatever it may be, the double and triple disadvantage, that's like assessing bi and tri-cultural living for these individuals, right? They are living in three different cultures or societies. And so, uhm, what we have to do is identify and help them to go back and forth, and I'll talk about that a little bit later when I talk about the skill development model uhm, because they are simultaneously trying to exist in a White able bodied environment and go back and forth between, ah, the colored environment that, that they are, that they are to integrate themselves with, the able bodied environment. And, and so this identity of, this idea of going back and forth happens simultaneously. And it's a bi-cultural, at times tri-cultural ah, challenge for them, okay? All right (cough). Some of, I, some of these, I've already talk about. I'll just highlight a little bit more, uhm, before I go into the model. If we look at, at, at sort of the concept I'm talking about, it's, it's really about being a minority within a minority, okay? The example, a Latino individual with a disability within a Latino non disabled community, uhm, within the White disabled community uhm, they're, they're existing on the margins of the margin if you will. So the individual, Latino individual with a disability uhm, may not necessarily be accepted in the White ah, disabled community, okay? Ah, the Latino individual with a disability may not necessarily be fully accepted in the Latino community, okay? Latinos, African Americans, Asian, Asian, we all have our own perception of disabilities and what the cause of those are. So we may even see our own folks in, with a disability as a disadvantage, okay? Within the White disabled community, obviously there are challenges there for a person of color to try and integrate themselves, right? Obviously the old notion of racism, ah, Eurocentric attitudes and, and perceptions impact uhm, those individuals in, in, in those communities as well. It's a double disadvantage, being Latino in a racist and disabled in a disable less society. That's the reality, okay? What happened is that these individuals are forced with a choice of who to align themselves with in society, okay? "Do I align myself with the non-disabled Latino people who reject me as a disabled person? Or do I align myself with White disabled people who reject me as Latino? Which do I choose? Do I have to choose? Should I have to choose?" And, and the reality is that these individuals oftentimes feel like they do need to choose (cough). This, with it, if we look at this in, in context within the context of society, the individual can be an oppressor, a member of the oppressed or simultaneously oppressor and oppressed within these, within these dynamics, okay? All right. I wanna start to move into the model and really start to try to provide a foundation as to really what the presentation, I really wanna spend the rest of this time talking about the skill development model. I was trying to ah, lay a foundation and provide some insight as to what some of the issues these individuals face, uhm, may, may be faced with. What I think makes this model and any, any model in intervening with any cultural group, whether it'd be with African Americans, Latinos, whoever, is that it requires us to make a multicultural shift, okay? It requires us to reexamine what we have been taught and what we have been educated on our entire lives as psychologists, as students, what have you? First, we have an assumption that the client must arrive at an unfamiliar uhm, place and, and, and, uhm, and at a specific time to receive unfamiliar services, okay? That's an assumption we make, okay? The second assumption we make is that the client is expected to discuss concerns quickly, all right? The third is that the western idea of communication about openness and self expression (cough). Another assumption we make is that the client is to change agent. Work hard enough, and you can accomplish your goals, okay? Major assumptions that require us to reexamine how we work in a therapeutically culturally competent way with not only folks with color but with folks of color who had disabilities, there's two more assumptions that we make, uhm, within, ah, working with, within a context of a culturally competent way. The other one is we also need to shift the traditional therapeutic environment, okay? We have this, this idea that therapy needs to be done in the office at a specific time, at a specific place, et cetera. It's 15 minutes. A therapy hour is 15 minutes. Uhm, we need to begin to shift that perspective. Ah, again, it redefines the traditional therapeutic hour. And then lastly this is, I think, one of the most important aspects as it, about becoming cultural brokers, okay? That's really about becoming a social advocate. And we talk a lot about that when we talk about developing cultural competence. And every time I say to someone it's, it's not about, you, you need to extend what you're doing beyond the office, people who always go like, "Does that mean I need to go out and then, and, and, you know, pick it and march and do all these other kinds of things?" And there's, there's an, there's a misunderstanding of what that means. Becoming a cultural broker means expanding your role to, to learn to integrate what you do with the various systems in which our individuals exist in. So that means that if an individual comes to our office and we try to heal them in that office but we don't intervene in another way outside that context, how much have we really done? How much have we really helped them in many ways? So what we need to do in making that multicultural shift is see ourselves as beginning to intervene beyond the office and as, ah, as particularly with folks with disabilities ah, becoming a cultural broker, learning how to integrate yourself within the various systems in which these individuals live. On average, a person with a disability has 12 professional helpers, that's an average, 12 professional helpers. As a therapist, it becomes your ethical, ethical responsibility to learn to exist within that environment with the individual, to learn, to integrate and help that individual move in that direction. Let me move into the, the skill identification stage model that, ah, Dr. Thomas Parham, ah, created, who's ah, right back there. And, ah, ah, he, he (laughs), he's looking behind himself. Uhm. Dr. Parham ah, developed this model, ah, in working, as I mentioned earlier, in African centered way with, ah, African Americans. And I think this model is, uhm, is ideal and one that could be translated to working with multiple groups in multiple ways. And so I've taken it and really tried to apply it in working in a culturally competent sensitive way with folks of color who have disabilities. Dr. Parham asked two questions. The first question is what to do, okay? What do we, what are we trying to do? What do we need to do? Okay. That's the issue. Uhm, and what, what I, what I have, these are the issues. There are, there are six issues here that Dr. Parham has put forth. So what we need to do is connect with the client initially. We need to do an assessment/ interview. We need to facilitate awareness. We need to set goals. We need to take action and instigate change. And we need also get feedback and be accountable for what we're doing, okay? I'll go into, I'll explain what each of those briefly means in just a moment. What, the other question that Dr. Parham put forth which I think really makes this model really practical and much more of a skill development model is he, he asked, okay, we, one, one second, Dr. Gibson, is he asked not only, we, we know what to do in some ways. These are some things that we know exist within the therapeutic relationship. But how do we do these things? What are the skills that we need to be able to connect with a client? What are the skills that we need to be able to make, ah, an, an, a culturally sensitive assessment? How do we set goals in a culturally sensitive way, okay? So that I think is where the skill piece comes in. If we're looking at the issue, the first issue which is connecting with the client, that's probably one of the most important issues. Will you put Dr. Parham's model up (inaudible ) (cough). I, I have, ah, Dr. Parham's model up here that he, uhm, developed in working with African American individuals, uhm. So he, if you look at his, his, the first issue connecting with the client, well, connecting with the client, he, what he, part of what he has here is the use of rituals, handshakes, libations, uhm, reading, giving poetry, storytelling, et cetera, also uhm, being with a client, right, creating ambiance in a room, shifting the context and setting, so again, shifting the therapeutic environment. How do we connect with people, right? There's, there's ways in which we need to connect with folks and it's not going to be, be the same for everybody, okay? If we look at the assessment piece, this is, this is how do we conduct a, a sensitive kind of culture centered interview in a way that the client feels validated that were in, in a way that we can gather information in a sensitive way. Again, I'll talk about some of these in working with disabilities. But I wanna highlight his model first. The third, the third issue that he highlights is facilitating awareness, okay? This one, I think, is extremely important for people with disabilities as well. It's about, uhm, recognizing what forces are impacting us, right, recognizing the, the social system in which we live. It's about being heard and being understood. It's about allowing the client to see that we understand the environment, the social context in which they live in and exist in. Ah, the, the next issue he highlights is setting goals which is pretty self explanatory, uhm, taking action and instigating change. How can we create change? What do we need to do as a therapist? What do we need to do in the therapeutic relationship to begin to create change for the client, to create change in the therapeutic environment? We need to, we need to have an intent of what we're going to do. And we also need to follow through with what we're going to do. The last issue that he highlights is feedback and accountability, okay? This is where the follow through comes in. Uhm, we need to know that what we're doing is working, okay? We want feedback. So the last issue is uhm, let's make sure that what we're doing is working. Ah, I think Dr. Parham highlights, uhm, examining congruence between goals and outcomes, okay? That's very important. It's just important for us to know if what we're doing is working. But we also wanna know that, if what we're doing is helping the client create change in some ways, okay? Okay. There is some pre, prerequisites to beginning to implement this model that I, ah, (cough) I have come up with based on ah, a variety of different models and, and, ah, a theories that I think are, are valid to what we're trying to do. The prerequisites to beginning to intervene in a culturally competent sensitive way are that we need to be aware of, of our own biases and assumptions, okay? If we're working with a person of color or a person of disability and we're not aware of these issues, then the questions we ask and the information that we get are going to be limited. They're gonna be narrow. And so we need to be aware of our assumptions and biases that allow us to be more open and to expand the range of possibilities that exist within the therapeutic environment. We need to value and affirm human diversity as an individual. We need to be culturally sensitive and view the, and, and view of isms as a social construct and not simply within the individual. Understanding of isms in their own role in mental health. So how does what we do, how do the isms in society affect what we do as a therapist in the therapeutic relationship? We also need to understand the world views of the therapist and, and that the client may differ. So our world view may be significantly different than the person that we're working with. We need to shift from a deficit model to an empowerment model. And this is extremely important particularly when working with people with disabilities. Uhm, we need to examine our own negative views or attitudes about what it is like for an individual to exist in this world with a disability. Uhm, part of what we, and making that shift and understanding that we have that perspective, it allows us to take a more positive outcome, a more positive perspective, a more empowering perspective that in many ways only helps us help the individual but ultimately creates change for the individual. And we also need to be able, to have the ability to work within a medical system from a systemic perspective. Uhm, as I mentioned before, the average individual with a disability has 12 professional helpers. So we have to be able to, ah, go back and forth between our system, the medical system, and any, any other systems that, that, that our, our client may exist in. Uhm, we have to know how to do that. We have to know how to integrate, help the client integrate, help communicate. Most of the time, between those 12 professional helpers, there's a lack of communication that occurs. And so it then becomes our responsibility as therapists to bridge those gaps and to integrate those 12 professional helpers if you will in a way that is congruent with what the client is needing, okay? I wanna go into the skill development model now. I've only highlighted three issues that Dr., out of Dr. Parham's ah, six issues, uhm, simply due to time and, ah, and, ah, limitations in that respect. So the, the three, I think, that I wanted to highlight today were connecting with the client, doing an assessment and setting goals. I felt like those were three of the most significant ones to highlight in the time that we have (cough). If we're looking at, at connecting with clients, particularly clients obviously from it, diverse racial ethnic background with a disability, if we leave what Dr. Parham left in there with the use of rituals, handshakes, et cetera, that becomes a very interesting dynamic for us as therapists, okay? Let's say an individual comes into the office with cerebral palsy, CP, uhm, is limited in, in the use of hands, may be limited in the use of, of bodily functioning, et cetera. What, what is our, what is, what is the way in which we might normally greet somebody, right? Do we shake their hand? Do we open the door for them? What do we do? In connecting with a client who has a disability, depending on what the disability is, that, that may change, how do we, how we connect, do we shake a hand, that maybe the person can't shake our hand. We have to be aware of those issues when we're trying to connect with the client in that way. So we have to, in some ways, almost educate ourselves before the person walks in the door in, in whatever way we can to begin to connect in a, in a culturally sensitive way for them, self disclosure, right? In any group we're working with, I believe self disclosure is of the utmost importance. Ah, obviously ethics, the, many, many ethics pro, professors are still teaching that self disclosure's a no-no. I continue to argue with my students who have those professors and give them personal examples of self disclosure and how that's therapeutically effective. So, self-disclosure is a must. Ah, explore disability, ah, identity and cultural identity, okay? This one is an interesting one because most people who have a disability, a person with a disability may become offended if you ask what, what kind of disability they have. Or if, if a disability an issue or what a, what's a nature of the disability. So I've got mixed responses when I, when I talked about this because some folks think, "Yeah you need to ask," there need, there needs to be some insight gained from that, and some folks say, "No, I don't want any one to ask me." The reality is, I think, it is important to explore the disability. I think it's very important. Uhm, not only is it important to explore the disability, but it's also important to explore the cultural identity of the individual, ah, that will impact how they view themselves as a disabled individual, okay, a person with the disability. So, I think, it is appropriate to ask, ah, the nature of the disability. When you do that, and how you do that, really depends on the therapeutic relationship that you have with the individual. Ah, but I do think it's essential and it's a part of the therapeutic, ah, connection that you have with the client. "Shifting the environmental contacts," okay? So we need to be flexible about the frequency of sessions, okay, the time of the day that we, ah, that we see clients, the, the length of the session. Let's say an individual with a, a, a, a disc problem in their back, has to get up and stand up throughout the session. Is that okay with you? Are you comfortable of that? Ah, let's say that, ah, an individual, ahm, has to cancel the last minute, less than 24 hours. That goes against your policy. Do you charge? Do you not charge? Again, shifting our environmental contacts, shifting the way in which we, quote-unquote, "normally conduct therapy," we need to reexamine some of those issues because, ah, in working with people with disabilities, we can be challenged if we have these strict guidelines about what, when someone should meet with us? When they should cancel? When they should show up? Person shows up in a wheel chair, scooter, do you move the chairs out of the way when they come in the office? Do you open the door for them? Ah, maybe the individual wants to shift out of the chair, the scooter, and into one of your chairs. Again, identifying some of these in, some of these information when connecting and in trying to build the therapeutic relationship become extremely important. Ah, again, ah, the last one used of stories and videos, positive role models. Dr. Gibson talked about this in her "Identity Development Model" and that there's a lack of positive role-models for individual disabilities. So part of what we can do as therapists in connecting, is finding some of those positive models. Finding some folks that, that these individuals can connect with, and, ah, and really integrate into their own process as they're moving to the therapeutic environment. And, "Educate the client about counseling process in the role of the counselor." Okay, that's the last one. If we move over to assessment, we have to look at verbal and non-verbal cues, okay? Ah, typically, as therapists, when we're talking to an individual, we're reading what they're telling us and what they're not telling us, okay? That shifts when you work with an individual who has a disability. There may be, ah, twitches. There may be body movements that, that, that aren't necessarily, ah, with, within what we would call the norm. Ah, does that mean that the individual is nervous? Does that mean the, do you've asked the individual questions that they don't feel comfortable answering? Or is that part of what their disability is? So again, we have to shift our, our thinking in assessing verbal and non-verbal cues. The language used as mo, used its model of disability. So, what, again we explore the disability, identity and culture, we wanna know what framework is this individual working from, the moral, the medical, the minority, what perspective that they have? When we know what perspective, what model of disability that there is in the world with, we understand about where they're coming from, who they are, and how they see themselves in relation to others. Spiritual, religious beliefs and values, right? Extremely important, if we look at the, the moral model where it, there is this idea of sin or test of faith, et cetera, those issues become very important. Latino clients, very spiritual, very religious, African-American clients, native American clients, a deep sense of spiritual and religious beliefs that impact themselves in relation to others. We need to assess those. Assess bi or tri-cultural living, that's what I was talking about earlier, the individual moving back and forth from one community to the other. We wanna not, when we assess that, we wanna assess their cultural strengths in doing that. So what do they have, what do they bring to the therapeutic environment that they can use to help themselves begin to integrate into the African-American community, Latino community, the able-bodied community, whatever it may be that we're trying to help them integrate. So we wanna generate multiple hypothesis that allow them to begin integrate themselves in these different environments that hey may be having the trouble doing so. Number six, I think, is extremely important, "Use of appropriate clinical instruments." The mental status exam, what kinds of questions that the mental status examination ask? Anybody, yeah, what kinds of question? Physical appearance, right? Disheveled, person was disheveled, person was well-groomed, all these kinds of issues. When we use a mental status examination with the person with the disability, and we're asking that they're disheveled or if they're well-groomed, and an individual comes in, and part of their disability may be part of having a difficult time staying well-groomed, maybe, or, or having the difficult time keeping close neatly. What's that? Not being able to find, not being able to find an attendant, et cetera. Absolutely. The MMPI, right? Ah, the MMPI asks a lot about physical symptoms, okay? Uhm, unusual physical symptoms, et ce, et cetera. So when we, ah, apply these clinical instruments, we need to, obviously, ah, look at them in a more culturally sensitive way. Uhm, I'm running out of time so I'm gonna move to "Setting Goals" and ah, highlight a few things in "Setting Goals." Again, view goals is positive outcomes, right? Ah, moving in a way from the negative view that we may have, as an individual, about what it may be like to live in this society, with the disability. We have our own perceptions and assumptions about what that's like, ah, as does the individual with the disability. We need to examine those and begin to shift that context within our, within the therapeutic environment, and begin to see these more positive outcomes, more empowerment. So the goals that we set or short-term positive goals oftentimes with, with people with disabilities. Ah, an accept, active acceptance approach, again, the empowerment model, uhm, clears specific focused treatment plan. Small pleasures, that's what it gives to the small positive outcomes. We want that individual to begin to develop, ah, rewards and benefits in working with us, okay? "Expand the role to the community." Activist in case management involve the, include the family in the support services. Any individual brought from a culturally diverse background, an individual with the disability, you diagnose that individual and you diagnose the entire system, the entire family. So, oftentimes, you may think that you're only going to work with that individual, but you actually may need to work with the entire family, and should work with the entire family in that way. So, in, integrating the family and the support system within the therapeutic environment becomes extremely important. So if that wasn't challenging enough, simultaneously what you're also doing is you're also assessing their racial ethnic identification, how they see the world to that lens, as well. Uhm, and so, it becomes a very complex process, but one that we need to be acutely aware of in working with folks who have disabilities, uhm, from diverse racial ethnic backgrounds, okay? I will now let Dr. Gibson, uhm, finish off and talk about communication and language. 

00:53:40
JENNIFER GIBSON  I know we're running short on time. (inaudible ) by the way. 

00:53:51
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO  A couple of minutes. 

00:53:55
JENNIFER GIBSON Okay, I'll make it quick. Uhm, just some basic to do or not to do when, when you encounter a person or a client with the disability, it is always appropriate to ask, "Do you need help?" just like you would in the other person. However, do not assume that they need help. Do not go, I had a friend that was blind on campus, someone made him all the way. Of course, campus, he has no clue where he was going. Uhm, so, when you do encounter someone who may be blind and gently touch him in the elbow, well, that be mean you're there. If you encounter someone deaf, talk to them directly. If they do have an interpreter, do not talk to him. He's not there, okay? (laughter) Sorry about that, but, okay. And if you are communicating with a person that read your lips, do not chew gum, use common sense, okay? And this is the last, always use person first(ph) language, always. Okay, we will let you open it up for questions. Any? 

00:55:50
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO  We don't have a whole lot of time left, but there's, I think, ah, enough for a couple of questions of folks that have any questions, or, yes? 

00:56:00
 I have really appreciate this presentation, it certainly has thought me a, uhm, lot. The one thing I wanted to share when I was in training, I think centuries ago, I, uhm, had a person with a disability (inaudible ). I was on internship and, uhm, she was very profoundly disabled. Uhm, she's in the wheelchair and obviously, physically disabled, but as you have said, always presented herself very beautifully. Uhm, you know, well-groomed and everything, and the thing that was striking was that she had absolutely no desire to talk at all about her disability. (crosstalk) 

00:56:40
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Uh hmm. 

00:56:40
 So this is talks about relationship. 

00:56:40
JENNIFER GIBSON Yeah. 

00:56:40
 She has a boyfriend, and you know, it was all about that, and there was like a denial... (crosstalk) 

00:56:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Right. 

00:56:45
  Uhm, you know, I was in the room... (crosstalk) 

00:56:50
JENNIFER GIBSON Yeah. 

00:56:50
 ...so to speak. And I didn't, you know, being a student, and I don't know what to do and I just, basically, I kinda went with her. (crosstalk) 

00:56:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

00:56:55
 You know, and so we talked about, we never really talked about her disability at all. (crosstalk) 

00:57:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Right. 

00:57:00
 And I, I don't know what's your thought is about that. 

00:57:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Well, it's, it's kinda like asking the, the person if alcohol is a problem, and, and they say, "No." Uhm, it, it could, it could mean, "no," or it could mean, maybe, "Yes, but I don't want to talk about it." And, and so, I think it, it's sort of those same kind of intuitive skills that we use. So, if you're, if, if you, if you think it might be an issue, and the person's not acknowledging or not wanting to talk about that, I think it then becomes our responsibility, as a therapist, to begin to address some of those clinical issues that are in the room. Uhm, again, I think part of what happens is that we become uncomfortable as therapists. Ah, ah, because we have our own assumptions, biases, negative views of what it's like to exist in the world with the disability. And then, that put, that puts a barrier and prevents us from actually exploring that issue. And it's like, you know, years ago, talking about or asking about suicide was like, you know, do we, now it's, we have found a way to integrate that into our therapeutic rapport and, and connect you with clients. And so, it's the same issue. I mean, I think you need, if you think, clinically, it's, it's an issue and the individual has not addressed it, then I think you have, it's, it becomes our responsibility to address it. 

00:58:15
JENNIFER GIBSON And, and also with that, you need to find out at what level of development of that person has. 

00:58:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO  What perspective.
