BRIEF THERAPY INSIDE OUT with Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed.D. Professor of psychology & Counseling and Diane Kjos, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling 

00:01:25
JON CARLSON All therapy attempts to be brief. Brief therapy clearly identifies a therapeutic focus in goal and then strives to reach that goal in a time limited efficient and systematic fashion. This series brings together the leading strategists in the area of Brief Therapy, each will demonstrate their approach with real people with real life problems.

THE DIFFICULT PATIENT: A BRIEF, CONSTRUCTIVIST APPROACH MICHAEL F. HOYT, PH.D. THERAPIST 

00:01:55
[sil.] 

00:02:00
JON CARLSON I’m Jon Carlson and I'd like to welcome you to another session of Brief Therapy Inside Out. 

00:02:05
DIANE KJOS And I’m Diane Kjos and this is our guest Michael Hoyt who is going to talk to us about Integrative Brief Therapy. Michael, how you know when you talk about Brief Therapy how would you define Brief Therapy? 

00:02:20
MICHAEL F. HOYT, PH.D. Brief as I use the term has two meanings actually one has to do with time and brief obviously is different than long, but I don’t think it’s as much a particular number of sessions as much as the idea being time sensitive or time efficient, no more than needed get to it as soon as you can, help figure out what would be useful with this client, help them get that and move on. So part of the idea brief is short or at least specific focus. The other idea behind brief has… has more to do with the theory of Brief Therapy and has lots of different approaches to Brief Therapy as I use the term I'm thinking largely in a constructive as to a post-modern framework looking at how the person puts their sense of their reality together and what other takes or ways of looking at the situation might be more empowering or give them some options that they are overlooking. 

00:03:10
JON CARLSON So just how does the therapy process work then? How do you do that? 

00:03:15
Jon Carlson, Psy, D., Ed. D., ABPP 

00:03:15
MICHAEL F. HOYT Well I use the term Integrative Brief Therapy because I don’t have one particular model like cognitive behavioral or psychodynamic or solution focused. The narrative constructive is underpinnings that I have… I have the idea that people are constructing or building a story of a world view so a lot of what I’m interested in is looking particularly that how the person puts their story together and helping them think of other ways they could frame or… or look at their experience. I think there’s also a very important place for specific skills training and often times when people are in one or another school of therapy, I think is too narrow of a lens. I’ve seen patients that gosh a psychodynamic interpretation here who seem very guilty, or there is some shame might be the right thing to bring forward. Other times I thought more specific cognitive behavioral approaches and skills training might be helpful. I think we need to have a systemic wide lens and look at what… what might be working best for this particular client. 

00:04:20
JON CARLSON And then you just tailor it specifically to that client… 

00:04:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT I try to. 

00:04:25
JON CARLSON …with your model. 

00:04:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT I try to. 

00:04:25
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:04:25
DIANE KJOS How did you come to this, how did you start out? 

00:04:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT Well, I think like most therapist I started somewhere but as I evolved I found that there are interesting and useful ideas from different schools(ph) and my training has involved a variety of things from family therapy and cognitive behavioral and psychodynamic and more systems in Eriksonian and solution focused and narrative and NLP and all of those different things. But I think what we were seeing now some interesting work is being done, saying what are the common factors that cut across different techniques or different schools and a lot of evidence is beginning to come forward now that empowering the client using the client’s resources regardless of what you call your approach to therapy the client resources and having a good strong alliance are things that are going to be most helpful. It's more than any particular school or particular technique so I try to have some thinking structure where we're trying to get to but I also very much try to be heterodox, who draw from different approaches. 

00:05:30
DIANE KJOS I see that a client alliance is when you mentioned couple of times so that relationship is a key point to this. 

00:05:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yes I think without a good alliance no matter what you're doing maybe technically right, but it's probably not going to work, you've to have a caring connection and then the client will begin to join with you and you can work better. 

00:05:55
JON CARLSON Is that the first step or the stage in change process with your approach, this alliance. 

00:06:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT I think it’s really the first in virtually any approach whether it's explicitly said or not, but I think first trying to develop some kind of alliance which partly involves the relationship of making contact with the person also sometimes setting the goals is part of developing the alliance so that you figure out what can I ally with you around? How we're going to work together? So early in the… the therapy process, and in the first phase if you well I'm usually think about things like alliance, goals, there is a whole series of questions that could be asked. Scott Miller a colleague of mine and I just wrote a chapter on this very topic of some of the questions you would ask in different phases of treatment but often times at the beginning what’s on your agenda? Will it be a useful outcome? What do you want to achieve here? How you know we can start meeting this way, the miracle question. 

00:06:50
JON CARLSON And do you actually ask these in the therapy session or do you give this data or these questions to the client ahead of time, kind of a note. 

00:07:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT I think that's an interesting question. Both, I think it’s helpful beforehand, it gives people a questionnaire they can complete including asking them what are you hoping to achieve? What would be the first signs of success? What would tell you that our meeting has been useful? So you get some ideas on what they are looking for and then as the session unfolds it's helpful to try to find specific goals to have a focus or foci on what you're trying to accomplish sometimes checking in with the person saying we have been talking half hour we're getting to where you want to go as we're going in the right direction. 

00:07:40
DIANE KJOS So it sounds like that this is sort of a dumb question, but are there clients that this doesn’t work with? 

00:07:45
MICHAEL F. HOYT Of course, not a dumb question but… 

00:07:50
DIANE KJOS Can you be able to… since… 

00:07:50
Diane Kjos, Ph. D. 

00:07:50
MICHAEL F. HOYT Well I think what I’m… what I'm proposing is something so broad that when you say that this doesn’t work with I could ask you know what's this. I think if its not working what you are doing it’s to come upon the therapist to step back and say this isn’t working what should I do differently rather than immediately labeling it as resistance or secondary gain or ego deficient or blaming the client in some way. We are suppose to have enough degrees of freedom, we are in a service profession to figure out a way to work with the person. At the same time sometimes we try all these things we do have the feeling that the client isn’t working with us and we may have to bring that up I’ve tried this… this, what do you propose or how can I be of help to you? 

00:08:40
JON CARLSON In a minute we are going to watch you work. Can you set up that interview for us and what we might look for with Terry and your work with her? 

00:08:45
MICHAEL F. HOYT Okay I’d be glad to, I just want to complete one thought very quickly. In the first phase, I think if we have a chance to even talk with the client before the session I give them a questionnaire ask them to think about what they want to accomplish, start the change process, get them focusing early in the session alliance and goals, in the middle of the session we are tending to do whatever it is we do; however we try to bring change about, reconstructing their story or teaching new skills or providing insight or education or support, near the end of the session we are near the closing the termination so we're asking questions about what’s going to be the next step? How has this been useful to you? What’s the take home message, trying to figure out what’s going to happen after the session and possibly setting up for a future sessions ah… and then there is the follow through what happens after the session. In a lot of Brief Therapy, we start a process, do some work but it doesn’t get completed or resolved or wrapped up in the session. Well somebody unstuck get moving again but we may not know if it was a really a good session or not a good session until we do some kind of outcome follow up. It may have been very dramatic but it may not had any impact or it may have been relatively quiet that had been very powerful in that person’s life so I don’t think we could just judge it by its intensity in the moment but rather of its duration and I don’t know to evaluate that way. The session with Terry I don’t know anything about the client, we're about to see, other than her name is Terry, so when I’m about to see somebody, there is a few things I tried to do. It tried to center myself if you will just sort of be open and relaxed and sort of ready to see what happens, ah… attentive in the back of my mind, be wondering you know why they come in now, is there particular crisis? What’s… you know what will be helpful and try to look for a focus. I think it should be very important to ask the client what you know, why are you here and how can I be of service to you? 

00:10:50
JON CARLSON Lets watch you work with Terry and watch you plant some seeds and see that the end whether or not we can harvest them. 

00:10:55
MICHAEL F. HOYT Very good, okay. 

00:10:55
DIANE KJOS Okay, good. 

00:11:00
[sil.] 

00:11:05
MICHAEL F. HOYT Terry we are going to be meeting just this one time, you said you wanted to get an insight about something. What… How can I be of assistance to you? 

00:11:15
TERRY Well I’m not… I'm not even sure I guess I feel that I’m… I'm you know more than half way through my life here and I’m… I'm really anxious in the… in the (inaudible ), anxious to make a new life and a new beginning or may be just retrain my old life so that I can have a little bit more. I want more joy of life maybe I’ve felt that I’m not getting all the joy out of life that I ought to. 

00:11:50
MICHAEL F. HOYT Hmm….hmm. So what’s the question you wanted us to focus on? 

00:11:55
TERRY Maybe it's… it's… it's do you have… do I… I want to put this on all I because I know it’s me. I… do I have a right to be happy? Do I have a right to… to seek happiness in the world, to… to be stingy and think of myself first is that… is that really okay? Is it… is it right to put yourself at the center of your world or should you live for others? 

00:12:20
MICHAEL F. HOYT Is that the real question for you, as I think what you think about it. 

00:12:25
TERRY I think because I feel guilty that I have a lot, I have a lot of things and I’m not satisfied with my life. I work hard in a lot of ways, I work hard physically hard and mentally hard and I take extra jobs and yet I don’t ever seem to do enough to feel worthy of sitting back and saying I’m… I'm going to enjoy this, that I have a right to enjoy things. I’m trying… I'm trying to open up my marriage, I’m trying to open up my family, I’m trying to maybe make a family, I feel very lonely a lot of times and so I just wonder if I have a right to ask or demand certain kinds of treatment so I thinks that's maybe moving from being I’m still a daughter since my parents are still alive and I’m a mother and I’m a wife and all these different roles these different roles that I’m in make demands on me and sometimes I feel that I’m not putting other people first but I should and so I conflict that way. 

00:13:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT When we've done talking this evening what would you like to accomplish in our talking? 

00:13:50
TERRY That’s a hard question because if I knew what I really wanted to know I guess maybe what I’m really looking for is what do I want to know, I can tell you some of the things that I’ve done to…to make my life better, but I… but I would like to maybe at the end of the session I’d like to be able to say, I know I can rely on myself. Maybe that’s it and to not to rely on others to make me happy, to solve my problems, maybe to help me find resources to find my own inner strength because I know I’m a strong powerful person, I know that it’s just hard to get it into… into my conscious. 

00:14:35
MICHAEL F. HOYT So how… how far in does it get and how does it stop? When say it’s hard to get it in, sounds like you kind of know it a bit. 

00:14:45
TERRY Well I say to myself when I get into car in the morning I’m a happy person, I have resources, I’m powerful, you know my little (inaudible ) I’m a happy person and I can do what I need to do, I’ve got the strength to do it and then as the day goes by or as the experiences comes along I… I lose some of that resolve and then I guess I let other people’s opinions of me, their judgments a look or something, I'm too directed or too easily swayed by what others think and so I start to think maybe I’m not powerful, maybe I’m not okay, maybe I don’t deserve whatever and so by the end of the day a lot of times or the end of a social interaction or… or a session with my family or whatever then I start to feel maybe I’m… maybe I'm not okay maybe things so I need to find ways to get that… that well filled up again, the… to find ways to feed or find… find ways to make myself feel powerful and okay and not guilty for having spent money or having a good time or having done x, y or whatever. 

00:15:55
MICHAEL F. HOYT Can you give me a specific example or two when you say feeling guilty and well being empty and filling it again. 

00:16:00
TERRY Oh if I spend money on myself or if I want to go on a vacation um… I like to, I guess I feel guilty because my husband is home, he stays home with our son who is… who is in high school and he can’t go because my husband is not retired and I’ll spend money on… on a flights some place and… and they can’t go and I feel like it’s our money, it’s not my money and so I’m spending our money for my enjoyment and that’s not right, somehow so I should and the here is where the should come in, I should stay home and I should wait till we can all do things together and I… I feel that. 

00:16:45
MICHAEL F. HOYT Where do the should come from? 

00:16:45
TERRY I don’t know I think there is this big portable police man that sits on my shoulder and says you should… should… should… should you know and I don’t know. I guess because I have this image of happy families and happy marriages were people are partners and they share things and that means money and that means time, but that’s where the resentments come out because I feel like my husband won't share. He’ll share money he’d give me anything… anything I wanted I mean almost literally anything, a kidney even but he won’t tell me, he won't share what’s up in his head and so I'll take the things when what I really want is him to share what he is thinking and I’ll give you an example or may be I’ve got a good example. My husband is in therapy he’s been in therapy for a year and I asked him to go so that he could learn to talk to me, so I can talk. I said what are you thinking? I’m mulling it over I’m thinking about things so we send him to a therapist every Monday night for $75 and they talk and he comes home and for the last five Mondays I’ve said before you go this is what his charge. I've said sweetie would you either invite me to one your sessions or would you in (inaudible ) I’ll make a list of the things that are really bothering you because I know you have trouble articulating these. And make a list and then maybe you and I could talk about it. I’ll do it he says okay and five Mondays he would come home and say oh we forgot or… or we are still mulling it over, or we’re still talking about it. I said well, okay so I feel then alright if you are not going to share that I’ll buy myself something, I’ll buy a bobble, I’ll buy a new coat or… or I'll buy whatever you know to fill that hole in my heart, to fill the hole the… the… the emptiness or what I usually do is I call up another guy or I’ll do something else I go outside the marriage for somebody who will share with me so that’s… so I feel guilty about spending money, I feel guilty about going out with other men, I feel guilty also that I… or I feel guilty that I’m not good enough, I’m not enough of a partner that I can bring out in him the things that I asked him to do, which seemed to be simple and so maybe this is what I’m asking him, maybe we get down to the nitty-gritty. Is that so much to ask for somebody to say why won’t you share your thoughts with me? Why do they have to be perfect before you can articulate them? That’s… maybe that’s… 

00:19:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yeah, it seems like a very reasonable thing to want to have a connection, a sharing. 

00:19:35
TERRY And I think the word is connection. 

00:19:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT With… with… with your husband so that’s the answer to the, that question. It seems pretty reasonable but I'm wondering obviously you are talking about how frustrating it is to you, it seems obvious. Would you agree? 

00:19:55
TERRY It hurts. 

00:19:55
MICHAEL F. HOYT It hurts. 

00:19:55
TERRY It really hurts and each time that’s to just you know that’s… that's oh I’ve forgotten or it’s a and maybe there is a real reason why they haven’t gotten to the point of where they can bring me and I don't really want to go because I been to this counselor before and I… she is a nice person and… and that’s not the point. Maybe they haven’t gotten quite there yet. I suspect he just doesn’t want to do it but he can tell me well anyway. So five years ago see every time this happens it brings back another… 

00:20:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT So what do you want to do about that… that… that and I’m back. 

00:20:30
TERRY Okay… okay. 

00:20:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT …instead of going five years ago. 

00:20:35
TERRY Yeah, okay. 

00:20:35
MICHAEL F. HOYT What… what you want to do about the situation with your husband? 

00:20:35
TERRY I don’t know what to do. I don’t know… I don’t know maybe if I stand over here, maybe if I… 

00:20:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT So you've tried approaching him in different ways. 

00:20:45
TERRY I've tried standing on my head. You know darling I’m having an affair with another man. Okay. How do you feel about that? Oh I’m angry. How angry are you? Well I’m really angry, I'm really hurt. Well how hurt are you? Really hurt. Can you tell me about it? I have to think about it. You know I mean does it get any more then, I mean do woman do any more than, I’m having affair with another man. Does that… I mean isn’t that like the slum peak, isn’t like the… I don’t know. 

00:21:20
MICHAEL F. HOYT Are you committed to staying in the relationship with him? 

00:21:20
TERRY I don’t know. I… I'll… I keep thinking well maybe it'll get better, maybe it’ll get better, maybe… maybe next week he’ll learn the words he’ll learn how to talk to me maybe next week, because you know it’s been 32 years I guess you know I’m hanging on because… 

00:21:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT Why are you hanging on for? 

00:21:40
TERRY I don’t know… I don’t know. Well year I do something you know like this year I got my own checking account and I learnt how to put gas in the car and I found out where there are apartments downtown that I can get and I found out what you have to do, you know it’s like do I have to leave this marriage, but then what I’m afraid is you know it’s like maybe then if I leave he’ll go oh is that all you wanted because usually that what happens. If I really get, if I really put his feet to the fire he’ll do what I ask him to do but so far I’ve haven’t found what the… what the flame is yet. That’s the frustrating part. 

00:22:15
MICHAEL F. HOYT Something you have been trying for years. 

00:22:20
TERRY I’ve been trying for years. I… I've really feel maybe I’m… you know I keep… that I keep maybe doing the same things over and over. I don’t know what else to try. 

00:22:35
MICHAEL F. HOYT You’ve gone to counseling with him? 

00:22:35
TERRY Gone to counseling with him. 

00:22:35
MICHAEL F. HOYT You have pleaded, cajoled, guilt tripped, argued, you have done all those right. 

00:22:40
TERRY I’ve done everything I get action when… I get action when I do something like say okay this weekend I’m going to New York and I’m going to be spending the weekend with another man dear. I will take the train by myself to the airplane or you can take me down. Oh I’ll… I'll take you but I’m not happy about it. Okay well then maybe when we go… when you come back we’ll go out on a date, you know then we'll talk for a while, then will talk… then will talk and I’ll tell, you know I’m quite candid with him about you know I don’t… I don't love, I love you dear, well I don’t know if I love him a whole bunch but I said I like most of you I just want to a little more of you. I'd like you to share this little sliver that you are lacking up inside and… and that’s what I get from other… other guys. I said other guys will you know will tell me if I’m full of crap or tell me you know that’s really I… I want from you I have got a perfectly good husband why can't I get that from you. I don’t know that sounds frustrating okay that sounds frustrating. Well and I… I thought well maybe it's because I’m not good enough, you know maybe I don’t have those magical tricks you know like Scheherazade telling that… you know maybe if I cook better food or… or so I went to workout classes, I've been going for three years you know to get puffed-up and you know everything I could think of to… 

00:24:10
MICHAEL F. HOYT Let me check something with you, its I hear what you are saying and you kind of smiling, at the story you’re telling is very sad. 

00:24:20
TERRY I'm sad, I feel very sad… I feel very sad about it because I'd like to know what… what because I like a magical wand I think I’m really afraid of him… I’m afraid that he is he doesn’t take care of himself and that you know that I'll be locked for the rest of my life with him that something will happen to one or the other of us you know medically or… or whatever. So I'm… I'm… I feel sad because I feel like you should have a happy marriage. People should be happy if they work hard and work at it they should be happy and I kept thinking what I’m doing wrong or what I should do more off because… and I… and I… I try to think of my life as a sitcom you know is the episode were Terry tries this or you know because I realize I get very depressed and sad and I’ve gone through that I took you know antidepressants and stuff, and said no I don’t want to do that. I’ve… I've just treated like a joke time, strong enough to get my ass out of there and that’s… that's not coming very quickly. 

00:25:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT I’m not sure what to tell you, its seems to me from what you are saying you have done everything in your power and it’s not that you’ve failed let’s say he is not being the husband you want and I wish I had a magic wand too you know. 

00:25:50
TERRY I was hoping you take a washcloth and smack me up over head or something and say listen you fool this is what you are doing wrong, yeah its and I know if I just keep looking hard enough if I look hard enough surely you know there will be a way out of it, a way out and… and maybe this is… maybe this is the way people are maybe this is… maybe this is the way life is a quiet desperation kind of thing you know, where you… you does get by you get by day after day. 

00:26:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT What do you think is going to happen? I will give you two scenarios. 

00:26:30
TERRY Okay. 

00:26:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT Scenario one its five years from now we meet again sitting here and I say I hear you stayed with him, how you think your life is going to be in five years. 

00:26:45
TERRY I think you know I see baby steps, I see either… either he’ll have moved a foot down the mile of the road or he’ll have had the big one and be you know totally incapacitated or but I can’t imagine I would have the strength to leave. I can’t imagine that because I haven’t yet. 

00:27:05
MICHAEL F. HOYT So you think if you stay with him he’ll either move to foot as 5280 feet and a mile or moved a one foot or he’ll have the big one a stroke or heart attack or something he’ll be… 

00:27:15
TERRY Yeah he'll stop (inaudible ) even have more excuses to be. 

00:27:20
MICHAEL F. HOYT So that’s the path if you stay on it five years from now you think you’re going to be at. 

00:27:25
TERRY That’s… that's the scary part yeah, that’s… that's scary and… 

00:27:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT Hold… hold the thought, scenario number two is five years from now you sit down again in here and I say here you planned of leaving your husband, it was a rough life a period of adjustment but the dust settled how is your life now. 

00:27:45
TERRY I think I’m living in a community of people who are… who are friendly with me. I feel that I have a… I have something to do during the day where I feel useful. I feel that I have a small apartment, I have a small car, I’ve a… a safe place, I've… I work in a safe environment or not work or volunteer in a safe environment or an academic environment um… I think. 

00:28:10
MICHAEL F. HOYT Would you have any relationship going with someone? 

00:28:10
TERRY Maybe or maybe not it might be with other men or it might be with a… with a… a… a group of women I really… that I do interesting things with I could see myself going to art museums and I can… so I can… you know why I can almost see myself doing these things because I do that every summer I take all the workshops I can and I go places and… 

00:28:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT So which life seems the better one to be in five years. 

00:28:35
TERRY You know it’s taken that step I know what’s the better one and I know that you know I guess I’m really waiting for him to do something really awful. 

00:28:50
MICHAEL F. HOYT To justify it you know. 

00:28:50
TERRY To justify it to go okay that’s it but instead its nibble… nibble… nibble… nibble. And you know eventually I’ll be with him and I’ll think that the foot that he did is a mile because I’ll be nibbled down to a low pile of dust or I'll get the… you know the big alright that’s the last strive I’ve had it or you know I'll find the strength somewhere or somebody makes it real easy I need a house sitter or something I guess I’m looking for some way to make it easy to make this step. And that’s…. that's… 

00:29:20
MICHAEL F. HOYT You’re looking for permission. 

00:29:20
TERRY I guess some yeah permission you know maybe that’s it… it’s okay… it’s okay to leave because my kids are almost on their own and I’ve… you know it’s okay to spend the money you know it’s okay to spend the money on an apartment, it’s okay I guess I’m afraid I would leave and… then come back because I did that once. I left for a week and then I came back and I said I won’t threaten again then you know I’m not going to threaten and play games with you… you know I’m so… you know… 

00:29:55
MICHAEL F. HOYT Hmm…hmm. So its sounds like the two paths one is clearly better but it's a courage to get on that path to take the next step. 

00:30:00
TERRY Its courage, yeah it’s taken the plunge, it’s the cold swimming pool jump in and saying okay. 

00:30:05
MICHAEL F. HOYT What you like in the cold swimming pool? What’s… what's the worst thing it could happen there? 

00:30:10
TERRY I don’t know when I went off to graduate school I… I… I picked up a suitcase and a box of books and I got on in airplane and flew from Kansas City to Texas didn’t know a soul(ph). I met a soldier on the plane he, his family took me to a motel. They took me out to… I made… I made friends easily you know it’s like I know. 

00:30:35
MICHAEL F. HOYT So you’ll land on your feet. 

00:30:35
TERRY I know I’ll land on my feet. I don’t know what is just, I don’t know what’s keeping me. I say sometimes what’s my stuff you know my possessions and I’m not so sure that I’m some married to them. You know yeah I know I can do it… it’s just getting the courage, just getting the courage to… to take the plunge. 

00:31:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT Hmm… hmm. As you taking in my back of my mind I heard music I heard the Beatles song she’s leaving home after living alone for so many years. 

00:31:10
TERRY Yeah you know I… I heard this lady talk one time she said she cleaned out her purse and she cleaned out her closet and then she looked over in the couch and there was her husband sitting there and she thought about just calling the Salvation Army, because he’s always there, but he is not there you know not really there and I don’t know that Beatles song but I’ve… I've heard of it but I don’t remember it but… 

00:31:35
MICHAEL F. HOYT Right, but you got the idea. 

00:31:35
TERRY Yeah. 

00:31:35
MICHAEL F. HOYT She's leaving home after living alone. It’s like you said about the Salvation Army, it's just kind of the furniture and I’m alone. 

00:31:45
TERRY Yeah it is, it's lonely… it's lonely and people don’t like to be alone they… they like to be with other people they like to, you know I’ve some girlfriends that you know we’re together and… and… 

00:32:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT (inaudible ) why move out something you’ve got the best of both worlds, you can have all this stability and when you get tired of it you can go to New York see your lover or you know go shopping or take a trip somewhere. 

00:32:10
TERRY The Guilt of feeling. 

00:32:10
MICHAEL F. HOYT The guilt? 

00:32:15
TERRY Yeah and I… and I been perfectly honest this last year is there anything you want to know? No. So that… that hurts… that hurts you know you don’t want to know you know maybe I’d stop. 

00:32:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT So, it’s not good because of the guilt and the loneliness. 

00:32:30
TERRY Yeah guilt and yeah… yeah because there is nobody to share the friendships that I’ve made. I’ve made some good friendships and I'm one of the… I guess I never gave up my first college lover and I… we're… we're still good friends and… and support each other and I like that feeling that you know when I need, when I need a new where those purse flashlights that doctors have, he can get me one, you know that’s just nice to know you know somebody will get me… or a new pad or medical brochures or you know whatever you need for post it notes or something like that. He’s a friend of mine you know that’s a nice feeling. I’ve got friends who do things for me and so I found a… a… a bright purple cashmere sweater at a thrift store and I bundled it up and sent it off to him but I didn’t feel like I could tell my husband I was doing this because he doesn’t want to know he doesn’t want to share it. Ryan(ph) is really going to like this he’s going to think it’s a hoot you know that I got it for four bucks at a thrift store and it's purple so he can give Jerry Farwell(ph) the business about being and you know queer and all this kind of stuff you know and I wanted to share that but I didn’t feel like I could so I’m just living my own little life in my house and I’m lonely. 

00:33:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yeah. 

00:33:45
TERRY I’d like to have a bigger… I’d like to have a bigger circle of friends. You know I’ll do this, I’ll invite people over I’ll do this now will you do something. Oh no, I’ll just take about years. I’ll take, you know so I’m tired. I guess, I’m exhausted. 

00:34:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT And you are getting nibble down. 

00:34:00
TERRY Yeah. 

00:34:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT And you don’t want to be nibbled down too far. 

00:34:05
TERRY No because I… I need things in between to bring me back up and I’m… I'm having trouble finding. I’m having trouble finding things that bring me back up, but it… but working out… I’m working at Naperville and one day about the first week I was there, I’ve been there eight weeks now one of the guys somewhere in the labs came by and said Terry I want you to come… come and sit at our table. Now I have a lunch bunch oh man okay and its… its great I feel like I’m part of that group and you know when I come and sit down they will say hi. I feel like I belong and they are talking and they include me so I’ve I know I can make friends easily, I know I can bring things people like me. I make friends easily, you know they sound open and you know they tell dirty jokes in front of me you know so I feel like I’m part of a gang, you know that is a good feeling. At home we talk about school and I’m tired of talking about school because next year there won't be any school because my husband is going to quit teaching there won't be any school, what are we going to talk about? 

00:35:05
MICHAEL F. HOYT Maybe that’s when the crisis is going to hit the family? 

00:35:05
TERRY I think it might… I think it might when I look over on the couch you know he’s either going to get his dirty magazines in his jean and I’m going to be gone or I don’t know what retired people do, you know they, I guess they rattle around and you know… 

00:35:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT So you kind of a cross roads you got to feel how you want to live your life and what you want it to look like for the next umpteen years. 

00:35:30
TERRY Yeah like they said a good news is your in charge and the bad news is you are in charge its awesome it’s like being you know Dustin Hoffman again plastics you know… 

00:35:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT Clipping(ph) an adult ah I think I got to pick, I’ve got to do something or it's not going to get down for me. 

00:35:45
TERRY Maybe it was all it's been all… it’s been all planned for me up to now you go to college, you work you go to graduate school, you get married you have kids you raise the kids and then… then a whole world opens up to you again. You know now you are in charge. 

00:36:05
MICHAEL F. HOYT Hmm… hmm, in one way that's a normal developmental crisis. 

00:36:15
TERRY I was afraid of that. 

00:36:15
MICHAEL F. HOYT Empty no… no… no… no but emptiness you know the kids are gone what we going to do with each other, now that we're not focused on the kids. 

00:36:20
TERRY Yeah. 

00:36:20
MICHAEL F. HOYT But it sounds like in addition to that there is… is very unhappy marriage going away you don’t connect to him and he is driving you to the airport so you can go and be with somebody in New York or somewhere and… and that's and he doesn’t get upset by that and that upsets you that he doesn’t get upset by that but he gets upset but he is very... 

00:36:40
TERRY But he won’t express it yeah that’s even scary and… and then may be that’s scary, you know what are you… what are you really thinking. I’ll tell you someday I’ll let you know later. 

00:36:50
MICHAEL F. HOYT Are you playing a… a kind of a game with him, you are waiting for him to snap and… 

00:36:55
TERRY I don’t know that’s it okay… okay what would a… what would a guy do when he snaps? What does what do you mean snap, am I waiting for him. 

00:37:05
MICHAEL F. HOYT No… no… no you know you said you'r hoping I was going to have a washcloth and hits upside on the head I’m not sure if you are expecting him to someday you know… 

00:37:15
TERRY Hit me. 

00:37:15
MICHAEL F. HOYT Hit you. 

00:37:15
TERRY Yeah in… in… in fact we have guns in the house and this is… this is an issue that one of my friends brought up, he said you know he might… he might be going to… he wants to buy a new rifle like they used in World War II, he said maybe he wants to use that on you. Oh no that’s you know we have got guns at the house if he wanted to do me and I think he’s afraid actually of his own emotions in a lot of ways but afraid of his own violent emotions, I think he’s afraid to get started expressing so he just holds it. I think and… so maybe I’d like to see a crack, maybe I’d like to see a crack. When we in '77 when we had been married 10 years we went through a 9 month pregnancy, got to the hospital and the infant was dead and I wasn’t allowed to grieve because it didn’t happen. We never saw the child, we didn’t discuss it, we didn’t… I finally had a little funeral about six months later but he didn’t express feeling then, so I should have gotten a clue if he couldn’t express feeling 22 years ago it’s going to be hard for him to express feelings now. So I grieved for us. I went to counseling and did the things that needed to be done and got myself pregnant and you know did the things, went through all that and you know handle that for us and I felt that big burden was never shared we never shared that burden. I still feel angry and resentful about it that I had to carry it all by myself. One day last year he came home from his therapist and felt very sad and he said we talked about the baby and we had to go through it again for him finally and I thought maybe we’d connect better then but we didn’t start to connect then because by the time I would start to cry he would make me stop and say don’t cry… don’t cry… don't cry so my boyfriend… my old college boyfriend and I would get together a couple times a year and spend the weekend in a motel and I would put the Kleenex on the bedside table and I fill Kleenex after Kleenex and soak pillow cases and just cry that’s what Ryan(ph) and I do when we get together I cry and we cry over anybody who has died in the last year and we cry over people we have heard about who died and sad things that have happened and we just have a wonderful time. We have a crying orgy. Then I feel much better when I come back, because I was crying with him and its okay and he never say stop, he’ll never say Terry stop just cry all I want. So that little sliver of my life I looked forward to a year after year after year and that’s what I… that's what I do with that one boyfriend we just grieve together. It’s really wonderful so… so that’s something Bill(ph) and I kind of did a little bit last year but I’d like him to crack open, I’d like him to talk about things and he is… yet maybe get started a little bit then he will stop, he'll just catch himself so I stay with him because I feel sorry for him, I feel sorry that he has no one else. He has no parents, no family no nothing, he’s got the kids and he can have the kids you know the kids are you know there… there if you know but he doesn’t keep up connections with his family so I’m kind of all he has and maybe that neediness in him ties him to me at this big… this big weight that I feel so sorry for him that I hang on to him and drag him along but resent the whole time, you know we'd resent the whole time it’s a grudging kind of thing, so that is a guilt, you know feeling guilty about that. 

00:41:30
[sil.] 

00:41:35
MICHAEL F. HOYT Now I know some of why you're so angry and so hurt. He has really not let you have your emotional life with him. 

00:41:45
TERRY He is not there… he’s just not there and I don’t know where he is and he won’t tell me where it's, what are you thinking about what do you have know, I don’t care what goes on in his therapist sessions. I don’t care what they do, I just like to have a little bit of help. I’d like to have a little bit of insight just crack a little what we are going to.. it’s like a big strong along nibble… nibble… nibble… nibble string you along… string you along 32 years I’ve been strung along thinking it will be better you know he… he’s compared to my brother-in-laws. He is a wonderful person compared to him you know he’s… he's… he doesn’t do anything naughty or bad or you know just but the one you know the little crack of a things that I really need he either can't or won’t give me and I’m angry about that. 

00:42:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yeah and after all these years its seems the bottom line is you are not getting it, whether it can't or won't. 

00:42:50
TERRY Yeah. 

00:42:50
MICHAEL F. HOYT The fact is, it isn’t happening. 

00:42:55
TERRY It’s not happening. 

00:42:55
MICHAEL F. HOYT It’s not happening. 

00:42:55
TERRY Yeah. 

00:42:55
MICHAEL F. HOYT And you need it and you can stay angry at him but it still ain't going to happen, isn’t happening, so you're going to stay in the situation and stay as angry as you are and so does you're or find some other way to… to live your life. 

00:43:15
TERRY Yeah. To live because this isn’t really, it’s not… 

00:43:20
MICHAEL F. HOYT The bigger. 

00:43:20
TERRY …yeah because it’s just not… you know I keep thinking there’s got to be more or something. 

00:43:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yeah and that could be, you obviously connect to your other friend. 

00:43:35
TERRY Yeah. 

00:43:35
MICHAEL F. HOYT You know so you… you could have a different kind of life. 

00:43:40
TERRY Yeah and I’m not looking to… to I’m looking to remarry. I’m not looking to you know to… to look for somebody to latch on to, I think I could find a little bit of friendship and companionship in a lot of different people. I think you know I think I’ve got most of what I need in me. I just need to get those other little pieces from some other people and you know I’ll do most of it myself just give me something to work with. And I could be, I’d like to think I could be pretty content, but it’s scary. It’s just you know having knowing what you have, have been known is so much easier to deal with then the… the what ifs you know those are the… those are the big what ifs and I’m smart enough to know there’s a lot of really weird people out there and a lot of bad things happen to people but not necessarily there is lot of nice places to be so it’s just getting the strength to say it's time or knowing when it's time. 

00:45:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT I may have already asked you but what would tell you it’s time? 

00:45:05
TERRY I don’t know having all the ducks in a row or having… 

00:45:05
MICHAEL F. HOYT You work more on needs that happened or not happened. 

00:45:10
TERRY I know sometimes I'm driving along and I say you know it’s time, oh it is time… it is time to go, it is time. 

00:45:15
MICHAEL F. HOYT …this when retires maybe it's… I don’t know but it seems what else? 

00:45:20
TERRY What else is it going to take I don’t know… I don’t know what it’s going to take. I guess maybe I’m afraid what my parents will think I mean of course they can’t live forever but… 

00:45:35
MICHAEL F. HOYT So you need to wait for them to pass on before you can. 

00:45:40
TERRY Before they give me permission I don’t know yeah I… I… I guess just finding the strength to take the first step. 

00:45:50
MICHAEL F. HOYT Do they know how unhappy you are? 

00:45:50
TERRY I tried to tell them… I tried to tell them the day of my sister’s wedding it was five years ago. I tried to tell them, I said you know I’m not happy. 

00:46:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT How they respond? 

00:46:00
TERRY They didn’t hear it. They can’t hear it. 

00:46:05
MICHAEL F. HOYT Okay. 

00:46:05
TERRY They can’t hear it because they really like my husband. He’s the son they never had so… so he fills the need in their lives. If they heard it… it would mean that they had failed as a parent because my sister has been divorced and… and they felt that they had failed terribly. They have… they took it very hard so. 

00:46:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT I see. 

00:46:30
TERRY So I think… 

00:46:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT And we have… we have got about 10 minutes left in our conversation here. How do you want to use the time? 

00:46:35
TERRY Well I guess I’d would like to know how what brought you to being who you are because I… I can’t imagine that you don’t feel somehow burdened or weighted down by the… by the things that people tell you and… and you want to help and sometimes you must want to hit, just smack people and say, you fool listen to me, it must be hard not… not to say that but I'll… but what brought you to your… what brought you to being what you are as a therapist. What brought you to think you could help people or… or have you have found success? You must have found success. 

00:47:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT I’ll… I'll try to answer your question and I’m not trying to avoid it but I’m curious why that’s what… why that's your question? Why… why would you want to know that about me? 

00:47:40
TERRY Because I’m always curious how people get where they are you know what kind… I don’t say what kind of breaks people had but what kinds of you know what steps along the way. 

00:47:55
MICHAEL F. HOYT Is it partly because you are kind of at a turning point and trying to figure how other people move forward or got through things. 

00:48:05
TERRY Yeah and partly because I think so much of what we do is chance, not… not… not by saying you know chance but… but just being in the… being at a place at a time when something happened you took this path instead of this path maybe. 

00:48:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT Hmm…hmm. I agree with you I think of a fair amount of life is chance who you meet at a certain time, what you hear and sometimes things happen by chance. I think we become persons by making personal decisions. When there is a situation where we see options when we have to choose that’s when our character comes out so we make ourselves rather than just it was given to me or to fell into my lap or something like that. And as a therapist, I mean I have a history like everyone that I went here and I studied there and I heard this and that sort of thing, but but I became very interested in how people, sorry, your question, how people put their story together, how they understand themselves in their world and how they sometimes come to a point where they're conscious of it and they can make a choice so you asked about isn't burdening, if it was just hearing people be unhappy or I’m in pain or I’m confused that will be terrible to leave even more than burdening it will be depressing of one after the other, but the exciting part of it is hearing people who have a problem but then seeing how they solve it in the way and maybe even assisting them in some way or suggesting if you looked at this way here’s another thing or just being there or encouraging them or so seeing people, let me use a cliché, get better you know kind of resolve their problems. I used to think that my job was to be a very wise and know the answer and know all the techniques to. Once in a while that can be true that sometimes you can give somebody an insight or there’s a certain way of asking a question, but most of the time I think people really know what they need and they are little scared or very scared of things in the way but they can solve things much more. You have… you have the answer within you. It would be pretentious of me to sit here and try to say here is what you are to do or hit you with a washcloth for that you know. I might not agree with everything but you know I have my values, you have your values and it’s very hard to, you know everyone is on a different path I mean we kind of come through different experiences. What I’m struck by is that your get your life in different compartments you are having a grief orgy in the motel with this person, you are having this these friends over here, you're having this very frustrating long relationship with your husband over here. Then of course different people serve or you know meet different needs to some extent, but it's remarkable how compartmental is there. And all I could do is go on, you couldn’t grieve with him or almost couldn’t, maybe a little bit. Terrible thing to lose a child, a still born child and maybe we got sort of put away I assumed you're saying that he said you know we are not going to talk about this, I don’t want to deal with this. It’s so I’m curious if we have more time to talk how you decided to put your life together like as how much was chance and just sort of fell into it, but if there have been times when oh I… I do have a choice if I do it this way or I do it that way, why you chose what you chose and then if it works God bless you go for it, but to the extent that it's not working sometimes we could… you could do something different, this may work for a while or kind of work but now it’s not working that its so I'd be curious kind of how you are going to resolve it or how you’re going to re-solve it or what you going to have to do different and it sounds like one possibility would be to doing well I’ll let it happen you know and… and.. and maybe something will happen a miracle will happen or you know prince charming will ride in or he’ll die and I’ll have a big insurance settlement no one will blame me or I don’t know I mean that's one possibility it could sort of solve itself. But I doubt if that is going to happen any time soon. I think you’re going to need to… to… to take responsibility we don't have to say, I’ve got to do something with my life. If you choose to go one way or another way that’s okay, you may say you know we took the whole thing and I don’t want to… what you call turn over the apple cart or it's not worth it financially and socially and my parents would… I don’t want to go through or you might say yeah I will be financial and social and my parents won’t understand and they will be upset but to thane own self be true, I think I got to do this. I don’t think there’s a sort of a long answer to the question of how I got into being the therapist. I think it’s, I’m interested in other things as well, but I think people are just wonderful and it’s how people become who they are and how they construct their view of… of themselves and was how they see their world and some of it certainly in your history you got trained in these values and you met these people and you’ve had these opportunities and you have read these books and these professors and all of that kind of thing, some of its genetics, some of its how we grow up, but then is a point where we also have choice, we say I'll get those are all true that’s my history but now it’s time to what am I going to do? I got to step up or I got a, now is I do have a moment of choice here and that’s where... 

00:54:30
TERRY And that's scary, choice is so scary. 

00:54:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yeah. 

00:54:30
TERRY Yeah. 

00:54:35
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yeah. 

00:54:35
TERRY Yeah, well Mary Engelbreit says don’t look back. There is this cross roads and you go and I… I think that's it I think I’m afraid I’d have regrets and you know oh I should have done this, I shouldn’t have. I think that’s what scares a lot of people is… is what if, the what ifs, the I should if is you know if I only bought (inaudible ) when it was you know… 

00:54:57
MICHAEL F. HOYT Sure. 

00:54:57
TERRY All those kinds of things and if you get… if you get weighed down by them… by them… by the, what ifs that's the scary thing. 

00:55:05
MICHAEL F. HOYT Whatever you do you are going to have regrets. 

00:55:05
TERRY Yeah. Oh yeah. 

00:55:05
MICHAEL F. HOYT He always going to say you know the path you not taken ever, but he gets what the path is your going to take. 

00:55:10
TERRY Yeah. 

00:55:10
MICHAEL F. HOYT Because you got tears in your eyes, pain in your heart, you're kind of frustrated with the situation. I don’t have a crystal ball I can’t see the future so about five years… five years but it sure sounds like it’s not. There’s an old saying if you don’t change direction you’re going to wind up where you’re heading. You know… you know something where you are heading isn’t making you very happy. 

00:55:35
TERRY No, it's more of the same and its… 

00:55:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT It's more of the same. 

00:55:40
TERRY …it… it just is, its… its and I think I know that on a lot of levels I… I realize that it's it is if you keep doing just keep getting in and I guess just the hope that oh yeah things would be better and I really should stay you know, first I stayed to my daughter graduated from high school then I stayed till she turned 18 and I stayed till… you know till like I got my first retirement check and now its I’m going to stay until you know so I always keep pushing that you know because I really keep it well he such a nice person you know a nice, so it's… 

00:56:15
MICHAEL F. HOYT And that may make it even harder for you. 

00:56:20
TERRY That’s what I mean if… if… if… 

00:56:20
MICHAEL F. HOYT If it the you just a (inaudible ). 

00:56:23
TERRY Oh, perfect you know that's…. 

00:56:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT That everybody would say poor Terry. 

00:56:25
TERRY Oh Poor Terry I know, yeah why? 

00:56:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT You may have to… you may have to do what’s best for you even if it doesn’t you know even if it isn’t politically correct or you know people don’t clap. 

00:56:35
TERRY And that’s… that's the hard things, taking charge of your own life and saying you know I did it… I did it and I… and I screwed up big time but oh well yeah. 

00:56:45
MICHAEL F. HOYT I did it and I didn’t screw up big time or I did and I screwed up a little bit and then I did something else to make it better. 

00:56:50
TERRY Yeah and that’s… and that's why you know that's why you have insurance policies and that’s why I mean you have safety nets. I mean we people have safety nets. You have health insurance, you have car insurance, you have all these umbrella polices in case you screw up you know you take the car out and you slide well that’s why you have insurance. If somebody is house sitting and they steal your crystal then that’s… that's why you know all those things but that’s the hard things is to say will do I have relationship insurance? Do I have broken heart insurance and what if I’m lonely? You know what if I’m lonely or there’s a burglar comes or I don’t know how to fix that thing in the toilet that you know… you know, all those things tie you down and so… so those are the kinds, those are the little… those are the little Lilliputian threads that all gullible(ph) threads that tie me down and once you know every time I break one of those threads I can put gas in the car, I can cash a check, I can learn how to use an ATM machine, I haven't learnt that yet but you know I do have my own saving you know everyone of those has been a little thread that I’ve broken so. 

00:57:55
MICHAEL F. HOYT So you’re getting more competent, this is going to be helpful. 

00:58:00
TERRY Competent yeah I think that’s… 

00:58:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT Because then you won’t feel that you have to stay because you are clumsy you don’t how. 

00:58:05
TERRY Can’t change a light bulb yeah and then part of it is you know I’m a small person and I’ve always been sort of gotten by because I’m helpless you know that’s… that's one strategy to have is to be a helpless little person, poor little thing you know well you know I’m 55 years old. The… the… the cute, the little woman has gone. You know. 

00:58:20
MICHAEL F. HOYT Taking charge is going to mean you know you can still be small and ask people to help with things you asking all to everything but you yeah, I thinking you're very tough. 

00:58:30
TERRY Yeah sturdy… sturdy…. 

00:58:35
MICHAEL F. HOYT You can take care of yourself. We are going to stop in just one minute or so. Can you give me little feedback has this been helpful, in what way and if its? 

00:58:45
TERRY Well I was hoping you had your magic wand stuck somewhere in the back of your… of your shirt but I think you’ve said what… what… what you had to say which is that it’s in me and I have to find it and… and you know I have to and I guess I needed to be told that, I mean if you don’t have a crystal ball then and this is your job then I guess there isn't a crystal ball and I’ve got to find my own crystal ball or magic wand or whatever and that’s… that's part of the most encouraging thing to say that I guess I look like the kind of person who has her own crystal ball so, and that makes and me feel good so. 

00:59:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yeah I’m glad this is helpful. 

00:59:25
TERRY It has been. 

00:59:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yeah anything else you want to say before we stop. 

00:59:35
TERRY Are you going to be on a talk show or are… are you on talk shows are you that kind of person. 

00:59:35
MICHAEL F. HOYT No. 

00:59:40
TERRY You have an Oprah day coming up. 

00:59:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT I don’t think so. 

00:59:45
TERRY You're not Dr. Laura in the making or… 

00:59:50
MICHAEL F. HOYT No she gives people advice on how to live their life and I'm trying to give people advice on how they should give themselves advice. 

00:59:55
TERRY Yeah… yeah but Dr. Laura has all the rules. 

01:00:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yeah. 

01:00:00
TERRY And maybe that’s what’s some of us are looking for. Here’s what you do, here’s the recipes. So, I guess I have to make my own recipe, is that what you’re telling me? 

01:00:10
MICHAEL F. HOYT Ah yeah. 

01:00:10
TERRY Okay. 

01:00:10
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yeah, good luck. 

01:00:10
TERRY Thanks a lot. 

01:00:15
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yeah. 

01:00:20
[sil.] 

01:00:25
JON CARLSON Michael is this a good example of Brief Integrative Therapy? 

01:00:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT I thought this was an interesting but difficult session. I thought some very interesting things came up but I wouldn’t say it was a particularly good session in a sense it was very hard to maintain a focus and get some kind of resolution to identify specifically what would be helpful to her in the timeframe that we had. I thought we began several different processes but it was hard to… to move forward enough to feel satisfied that the client had gotten all that she could be getting from therapy. 

01:00:55
JON CARLSON What would you do next if you had the opportunity to work with Terry? 

01:01:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT Well there are several different directions, what… what was most apparent to me was how much she was preoccupied with her own take on the situation with her husband and how she was not particularly aware of her husband’s experiences of her, so you may want to focus more on the systemic interpersonal aspect and I think she gave several times certain clues in that direction asking questions about is there something else I should do? What am I, you know I’ve tried this, I’ve tried that but it would have been helpful I think in this session or in the next session to begin to focus more on what do you think would be helpful from your husband’s perspective for you to be doing. 

01:01:40
DIANE KJOS Would… would you have brought him in? 

01:01:45
MICHAEL F. HOYT Ah it’s a complicated question well I hesitate it because when you asked if I thought a long time ago a paper I read from one of my mentors Carl Whitaker talked about when divorce beckons it’s very important often at times to get both partners in so that they could together try to learn to communicate with one another. She mentioned that her husband is in therapy and learning, I suppose how to talk about his feelings with the therapist and in some ways it may make her feel even more excluded why doesn’t he do that with me. I suppose the idea there is when he learn some of this with the therapist and then take it home. I think soon or later there is going to need to be some skills training how they can interact as a couple more effectively, certainly the way she’s going at it doesn’t sound like she is getting what she wants and I think she has become quite aggravated and strident and it’s only going to drive him further away, that's my supposition I’ve never… never seen them together or seen him. 

01:02:50
JON CARLSON So it sounds like you would work on empathy with her, for her husband's position and may be help her to take some responsibility for the distance that is between them and you might do this individually and then as a couple. 

01:03:05
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yes I think she, my sense at the beginning was that she certainly comes across as very strident and she was very wind up and there’s a barrage of words you just talking a mile in a minute and I began to get a little sense of what it might be like to try to be her partner, to be her husband and that at one time (inaudible [01:03:23), it’s like she kind of closes her eyes, she is talking so fast, she is… she is in her own world and not particularly connecting. She is not very present to the media. 

01:03:30
DIANE KJOS She is listening to herself, and that’s about it. 

01:03:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT Right and so she got to get her story going that involves I’m though rather than me and me. 

01:03:40
JON CARLSON In a minute we are going to watch some clips and comment on them, can you just describes your own impression of her, you have kind of talked around it here at the first part but just when you think of, you’ve spent 45 minutes with her. 

01:03:55
MICHAEL F. HOYT If first she sort of exploded. There’s all this talk and all and I had a sense that she was somewhat anxious and somewhat a bit pressured. I also had the feeling there is some great vulnerability that she had been wounded something was hurting her and I was concerned how to bring some of that forward if that would be helpful to her without, I wanted to have some impact without trauma. I didn’t want her just to feel blamed or… or shamed she is quite frustrated but I think there is some kind of pain. She tells us a bit about it when she talks about the still born child and her pains and she had to grieve. In some ways thinking more systemically she is carrying the affect if you will for the couple. She is much more the expressive one and he sounds from what you her description is sounds like he is more intellectualized somehow it would be helpful if they could each be more complete he could become more expressive, she can become more a tuned in interpersonal. 

01:05:00
JON CARLSON And she seems quite self-centered as you alerted to her before would… would you think she'd have a… a personality disorder in that direction. 

01:05:10
MICHAEL F. HOYT I usually don’t think in terms of personality disorder as such, but I’m familiar with what you are saying Axis II personality disorder and a certain she has a certain strong style, I’m not sure how helpful it is to call it a personality disorder, I think it objectifies her ah… I don’t think she would think of herself as having a personality disorder, be interesting to explore with her how she does think of herself and what her senses of her interpersonal relatedness is opposed to would you call it a self centeredness. 

01:05:45
JON CARLSON It was… to me it might make it I have to think twice about whether or not she could take feedback and so I might be little cautious about what I just might say to her and you know in a session. I don’t know if those thoughts occurred to you. 

01:05:55
MICHAEL F. HOYT Couple of times when I would say something she’d sort of blow by it. I would say something and… and she would sort of hear it and later she might even use some of the words. I mentioned a path and near the end she uses the word taking a path, but she pretty quickly kind of goes on her way. It might have been helpful oh lets come back to that. I tried to do that and we will see it in the clip I think why so give me a specific example, trying to get more focused, because I think in some way she is staying away from more tender or sensitive feelings, her defense in a sense is the rapidity of her speech and her closing off the other person. 

01:06:30
JON CARLSON Why don't we just move on to that clip and have one of these opening clips anyway of where you're trying to get her to focus. 

01:06:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT Okay, let me say the one… one other thing. I’m not… I’m thinking now in terms of the stages of patient who had that James Prochaska, John Norcross, other people have written about and often times we expect patients to be ready to make a change and take an action but I think the stages are pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, planning then action and I think she needs she is not quite ready to make the change. So I'm not quite clear what change she wants to make, she doesn’t yet even see herself as part of the problem. She sees herself more as a victim of her husband’s coldness or his aloofness or intellectualization so I think we're going to have to kind of move along with her in the way that’s going to get her ready to look at her part. I’m not sure we got all the way there. 

01:07:30
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:07:30
JON CARLSON Lets watch. 

01:07:30
TERRY …I conflict that way. 

01:07:35
MICHAEL F. HOYT When we've done talking this evening what would you like to accomplish in our talking? 

01:07:45
TERRY That’s a hard question because if I knew what I really wanted to know I guess maybe what I’m really looking for is what do I want to know, I can tell you some of the things that I’ve done to…to make my life better, but I… but I would like to maybe at the end of the session, I’d like to be able to say I know I can rely on myself. Maybe that’s it and to not to rely on others to make me happy, to solve my problems, may be to help me find resources to find my own inner strength because I know I’m a strong powerful person, I know that it’s just hard to get it in to… in to my conscious. 

01:08:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT So how… how far does it get and how does it stop? 

01:08:35
JON CARLSON Did you learn what you needed to learn from her about the outcome that she was looking for? 

01:08:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT No it was too vague. I think one of the hallmarks of Brief Therapy is to try to have a clear focus how we know this has been useful? What are you willing to change today and what’s on our agenda? At the end of the meeting, if this has been useful what will be different? And she stays at pretty global levels, so it’s very difficult to know particularly what is she looking for, how can it be addressed. I think it’s going to be very important to try to frame it in a way that is achievable. 

01:09:10
JON CARLSON And… and in this first few minutes there is other examples of that too where you continue to strive to get… to help her to become specific. 

01:09:20
DIANE KJOS Focused. 

01:09:20
MICHAEL F. HOYT Hmm…hmm. 

01:09:20
JON CARLSON Why don't we watch another one of those right now? 

01:09:20
MICHAEL F. HOYT Good okay. 

01:09:25
TERRY I maybe, I don’t deserve whatever and so by the end of the day a lot of times or the end of a social interaction or… or a session with my family or whatever then I start to feel maybe I’m… maybe I'm not okay maybe things so I need to find ways to get that… that well filled up again the to find ways to feed or find… find ways to make myself feel powerful and okay and… and not guilty for having spent money or having a good time or having done x, y or whatever. 

01:10:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT Can you give me a specific example or two when you say feeling guilty and well being empty and filling it again. 

01:10:05
TERRY Oh if I spend money on myself or if I want to go on a vacation um… I like to, I guess I feel guilty because my husband is home, he stays home with our son who is… who is in high school and he can’t go because my husband is not retired and I’ll spend money on… on a flights some place and… and they can’t go and I feel like it’s our money, it’s not my money and so I’m spending our money for my enjoyment and… 

01:10:40
JON CARLSON What are you feeling Michael that she is just talking and talking and doesn’t seem like her answers are exactly what you are looking for? 

01:10:45
MICHAEL F. HOYT One of the things I was stuck by just now watching it is how I’m joining with her in problem talk rather than looking for solution talk, talking about your guilt what goes wrong and she’ll talk a lot about that rather than looking it for the exceptions at times when things have gone better, when her well is full, when she feels powerful the times where she has been able to connect with her husband, in retrospect I’m not quite sure why that I took that path. I don’t think it was a good path to take, in some ways I think I was trying to be supportive of her and join with her and seemed fragile. I wanted to hear and understand some of what she is going to validate, acknowledge her experiences at the same time I think we don’t want to reify it, we don’t want to make that the only way of looking at the reality so it might have been helpful to kind of jostle a… a little bit and kind of perturb you know… you say you are feeling that way and try to explore other text you might have added. 

01:11:45
DIANE KJOS With almost a sense of desperation about her just, she enunciates and she is so dramatic about it and it’s just a real. 

01:11:55
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yeah, she even uses the phrase someone there in the interview lives are quiet desperation that she is… she is very unhappy. In Brief Therapy we're usually trying to deal with particular problem, solve something and she is presenting a much more existential or global in the middle of my life I can in the dark woods I came at this spot, and I’m not sure which way to go. It’s going to be hard to put a frame around it to make… help her make some kind of existential shift in one's session. I’m going to try to suggest you are going to have to make a choice, you don’t want to just wait and be passive hoping something will happen but I think it’s not focused enough and I… I think that was partly my responsibility to try to focus down to something that she could take away and it would be more specific. 

01:12:45
JON CARLSON Well in this next piece you're doing just that, you're continuing to help her to focus, sort of try to you know assist her in focusing, let’s watch this bit. 

01:12:55
TERRY So five years ago see every time this happens it brings back another. 

01:13:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT So what do you want to do about that… that… that and I’m back… 

01:13:05
TERRY Okay… okay. 

01:13:05
MICHAEL F. HOYT …instead of going five years ago. 

01:13:10
TERRY Yeah, okay. 

01:13:10
MICHAEL F. HOYT What… what do you want to do about the situation with your husband? 

01:13:10
TERRY I don’t know what to do. I don’t know… I don’t know maybe if I stand over here, maybe if I… 

01:13:15
MICHAEL F. HOYT So you've tried approaching him in different ways. 

01:13:20
TERRY I've tried standing on my head. You know darling, I’m having a affair with another man. Okay. How do you feel about that? Oh I’m angry. How angry are you? Well, I’m really angry, I'm really hurt. Well, how hurt are you? Really hurt. Can you tell me about it? I have to think about it. You know I mean does it get any more then, I mean do woman do any more than, I’m having affair with another man. Does that… I mean isn’t that like the slum peak, isn’t like the… I don’t know. 

01:13:55
JON CARLSON It seems like as I watch this clip that they could really benefit from couples therapy, just jumps right out at me that it would be so nice to see the two of them together. 

01:14:05
MICHAEL F. HOYT I agree and even if you are seeing a one person you are still doing couples therapy, you’re helping the person in their interpersonal world so the husband in… in some ways other family members or history is somehow present in the realm(ph) as well as her whole system. As I approach Brief Therapy it's usually more present to future oriented and I felt when I said come on back and instead of five years ago what are you going to do now, I was concerned she could tell another story that would again prove how bad her husband was in her mind and it wasn’t going to help her change anything or see anything options, so I wanted to begin to look for some options. Now what she said again watching it I've… I wish I had done something different. She says, I’ve tried this and that and standing on my head you know I could have said sounds like you are looking for a way to connect with him, when have you succeeded, even the little tiniest bit I think we should look for a small exception to the problem and try to grow that a bit and that might have also given her some help and encouragement rather than just taking her global impression that she can't connect with him. 

01:15:20
DIANE KJOS I'm wondering what was going on with you at that point, did you begin to… beginning to feel kind of like the husband or were you beginning to kind of feel sorry for him? 

01:15:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT Not exactly sorry for him, and not exactly like the husband but I was beginning to have some sense of how hard it is and her idea that she says it how do you try to connect him, hi, honey I'm having an affair, as an… a sort of opening salvo and I used the term deliberately it’s kind of a barrage on attack rather than I'd like to be closer or want to hear what I’m going through or how’s your day been or something you try to make some kind of a bridge, but instead she… she begins with something as you know quite shocking and provocative and then is surprise that he doesn't warm up and then bear her soul. 

01:16:15
JON CARLSON As a Brief Therapist, have you ever tempted to try to explore where she learnt that style and may be have that style might be a part of both hers and her husband’s families of origin? 

01:16:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yes, I think it would be helpful for her to recognize that style the provocativeness, the intensity of it and we were one school of Brief Therapy we… we might be ask her to how did you get recruited into this? How did you learn this is a way of… of interacting or from more… more a psychodynamic perspective you could begin to look into the history or cognitive behavioral perspective, where did you learn these with the self and other schemas, but I think it’s going to be very helpful for her to get some psychological awareness so she can shift the way she is constructing her… her world view. 

01:17:05
JON CARLSON So again in this integrated model that… that you’re advocating there’s a lot of different ways to approach this particular situation. 

01:17:15
MICHAEL F. HOYT Right I’m usually thinking how is this client stuck? What do they need to get unstuck and then how can I facilitate or provide that. Sometimes the person stuck because they lack information or certain skills, other times they maybe stuck because they need some support or encouragement, they maybe stuck for lots of different reasons and I think when we get lock there into one model or one school lot of times we narrowed our options and using the integrative term there’s some research coming out now about which factors really make a difference in… in therapy and empowering clients, the alliance and the client factors are much more important than specific techniques. I think all of the techniques are useful if they are going to help the client use their own resources better and then become more empowered, learn some new thing that they can use to achieve their goals. 

01:18:15
JON CARLSON In this next clip one of the strategies that you use is that of a mediacy with Terry. Let’s see how that works. 

01:18:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT Okay. 

01:18:25
TERRY Yeah I could of to… 

01:18:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT Let me check something with you, its I hear what you are saying and you kind of smiling, the story you’re telling is very sad. 

01:18:40
TERRY I'm sad, I feel very sad… I feel very sad about it because I'd like to know what… what because I like a magical wand I think I’m really afraid of him… I’m afraid that he is he doesn’t take care of himself and that you know that I'll be locked for the rest of my life with him that something will happen to one or the other of us you know medically or… or whatever. So I'm… I'm… I feel sad because I feel like you should have a happy marriage. People should be happy if they work hard and work at it they should be happy. 

01:19:15
JON CARLSON When I look at that clip I’m brought back to Diane’s comment of it looks as if you are like her husband just kind of sitting there and just taking all of this in and not feeling like you can participate either. 

01:19:35
MICHAEL F. HOYT And I see the sadness is a sad story and she says yes but then her voice doesn’t particularly seem sad, she doesn’t slow down and there doesn’t seem to be a deepening of experience. She quickly kind of pushes past it. 

01:19:45
DIANE KJOS Sort of a Teflon response it just rolls off. 

01:19:50
MICHAEL F. HOYT You know yeah and there may be reasons I’m sure their reasons why she is defended in that way but the… the impact on me as the therapist is I begin to get that feeling of being furniture that I'm just there and no matter what I say the story is going to march on in a certain cadence and its beginning to get a sense of how refractory. Yeah this to me is a signal that I need to do something different. Maybe not be confrontative but find a different way an ingress to make more real contact with her because what I’m doing isn’t working, we are not getting… 

01:20:30
DIANE KJOS And often that… that kind of a immediacy response will do that, what kind of break in and it just didn’t… didn't even do that for you. I always… I was having this vision. 

01:20:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT Although you know she is going to come to that I mean she is going to in a bit talk about this very sad loss of her child. 

01:20:45
DIANE KJOS Yeah and she did get to that. Yeah I was having this sort of vision of her driving over for the session just rehearsing kind of what she was going to… to tell you. 

01:20:55
MICHAEL F. HOYT Hmm… hmm. 

01:21:00
DIANE KJOS She said this a locked. 

01:21:00
JON CARLSON It looks like she was well schooled in… in… in that in and really focusing on the past and focusing on the present and then in this next clip we are going to watch you get her to look it were she is headed, you know what the further might be like for her. Let’s watch her response. 

01:21:20
MICHAEL F. HOYT Okay. 

01:21:20
TERRY …you get by day after day. 

01:21:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT What do you think is going to happen? I will give you two scenarios. 

01:21:25
TERRY Okay. 

01:21:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT Scenario one its five years from now we meet again sitting here and I say I hear you stayed with him, how you think your lives going to be in five years. 

01:21:40
TERRY I think you know I see baby steps I see either… either he’ll have moved a foot down the mile of the road or he’ll have had the big one and be you know totally incapacitated or but I can’t imagine I would have the strength to leave. I can’t imagine that because I haven’t yet. 

01:22:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT So you think if you stay with him he’ll either move the foot as 5280 feet and a mile or and have moved one foot or he’ll have the big one a stroke or heart attack or something he’ll be… 

01:22:10
TERRY Yeah he'll stop (inaudible ) I bet but even have more excuses to be. 

01:22:15
MICHAEL F. HOYT So that’s the path if you stay on it five years and now you think you’re going to be at. 

01:22:20
TERRY That’s… that's the scary part yeah, that’s… that's scary and… 

01:22:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT Hold… hold the thought, scenario number two is five years from now you sit down again in here and say here you planned of leaving your husband, it was a rough life a period of adjustment but the dust settled how is your life now. 

01:22:40
TERRY I think I’m living in a community of people who are… who are friendly with me. I feel that I have a… I have something to do during the day where I feel useful. I feel that I have a small apartment, I have a small car, I’ve a… a safe place, I've… I work in a safe environment or not work or volunteer in a safe environment or an academic environment um… I think. 

01:23:05
MICHAEL F. HOYT Would you have any relationship going with someone? 

01:23:05
TERRY Maybe or maybe not it might be with other men or it might be with a… with a… a… a group of women I really… that I do interesting things with I can see myself going to art museums and I can so I can, you know why I can almost see myself doing these things because I do that every summer I take all the workshops I can and I go places and… 

01:23:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT So which life seems the better one to be in five years. 

01:23:30
TERRY You know it’s taken that step I know what’s the better one and I know that you know I guess I’m really waiting for him to do something really awful. 

01:23:45
DIANE KJOS Come back. 

01:23:45
JON CARLSON Michael this is kind of like let’s make a deal we got door number one and door number two and it seems like door number one is not a very happy place and yet she isn’t wanting to go to door number two either. 

01:24:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yes… yes I think she as an dilemma that she is unhappy here but that's scary she is not sure she uses the word I’m safe… safe… safe… safe several times and that will be something to explore with her and I’m also struck by how vividly she door number two as you called it five years from now if you left him she paints a picture and she speaks of it in the present tense. I’ve got this I’m doing that, I’ve got these friends, but I have to ask is there a relationship in there, it’s still it’s very monodic its one person rather than it's in relationship. The way she so quickly vividly began to paint that picture it appeared to me again looking now it might have been a very good time to ask a different question suppose to know while you are sleeping a miracle occurred and when you wake up tomorrow you and your husband are communicating a bit better. What will you be doing differently and what will he be doing differently? What will be the first small thing you’re doing to facilitate the communication and on his side as well? To begin to paint the positive picture. It would have been a different way to approach this. 

01:25:15
JON CARLSON Yeah in a few minutes we begin to see some emotions in this session we are going to move to that clip where she begins to express this sadness, was that surprising when that showed up and it kind of came she has been on this one path and then all of a sudden you seem to break. 

01:25:35
MICHAEL F. HOYT I wasn’t sure what the content would be but when we sat down and she started to talk she seemed so almost manicky that I had a sense there was something else going on sadness or something and so. 

01:25:50
DIANE KJOS Anger. 

01:25:50
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yes. 

01:25:50
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:25:50
JON CARLSON You were exactly sure what it was going to be but you had some signs that something was going to happen. 

01:25:55
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yeah I had a clinical institution if you will had some sense that they would be something more vulnerable something… something softer. I think the anger that we see and she certainly comes across strident, angry, rapid fire. I think that’s there but that’s in response to something. I think she is hurt and she is… she is wounded and what we are about to see I think is a one of the wounds or may be others but this is certainly a kind of a… a symbol if you will it’s a terrible thing in their life and how out of sync they were with one another. 

01:26:35
JON CARLSON And lets revisit. 

01:26:35
TERRY And so maybe I’d like to see a crack may be… I’d like to see a crack. When we in '77 when we had been married 10 years we went through a 9 month pregnancy got to the hospital and the infant was dead and I wasn’t allowed to grieve because it didn’t happen. We never saw the child, we didn’t discuss it, we didn’t… I finally had a little funeral about six months later but he didn’t express feeling then so I should have gotten a clue if he couldn’t express feeling 22 years ago it’s going to be hard for him to express feelings now. So I grieved for us. I went to counseling and did the things that needed to be done and got myself pregnant and you know did the things, went through all that and you know handled that for us and I felt that big burden was never shared, we never shared that burden. I still feel angry and resentful about it that I had to carry it all by myself. One day last year he came home from his therapist and felt very sad and he said we talked about the baby and we had to go through it again for him finally and I thought maybe we’d connect better then but we didn’t start to connect then because by the time I would start to cry he would make me stop and say don’t cry… don’t cry… don't cry so my boyfriend… my old college boyfriend and I would get together a couple times a year and spend the weekend in a motel and I would put the Kleenex on the bedside table and I'd fill Kleenex after Kleenex and soak pillow cases and just cry that’s what Ryan(ph) and I do when we get together I cry and we cry over anybody who has died in last year and we cry over people we have heard about who died and sad things that have happened and we just have a wonderful time. We have a crying orgy. 

01:28:50
JON CARLSON And what did you see going on here it sounded to me like this was right out of days of our lives and this was to something that she routinely dramatically presents as justification for having an affair and did you feel that her expressions were heartfelt? 

01:29:10
MICHAEL F. HOYT I felt her expressions were heartfelt that she seemed very genuine certainly there is lot of ethical, moral, dilemmas here and which way to go and… and I sit there and sort of tacitly approve by not commenting on… on her behavior in terms of the ethical dilemmas also there’s the problem of how are going to get closer with your husband if you’re having an emotional life with someone else so its working against her expressed desires, so there is a lot of problems. It’s also struck this was the time she seemed most in the room, most real with me, in a way kind of a parallel process. She goes off with her boyfriend and… and has a grief orgy as she calls it and here she connects, but she connects through sadness. It’s also remarkable as soon as she came the husband years later in therapy comes home says I've, we talked about the baby. 

01:30:10
JON CARLSON She loves it, she wants it. 

01:30:10
MICHAEL F. HOYT And she takes it almost as in a front light I’m being burdened with this and now you are making me remember this even though she is also saying I want to be close to him and I think his grief would have been a place where they could… could have connected if she could be accepting of it. 

01:30:25
DIANE KJOS But I wasn't hear you talk to the therapist about the baby, but you don’t talk to me about the baby. 

01:30:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT Right. 

01:30:30
DIANE KJOS So there was... 

01:30:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT So we started with the therapist but it then he then came home. 

01:30:30
DIANE KJOS But he did tell her but I mean I just heard her response from her internal response being why didn’t you talk to me about the baby. 

01:30:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT Right she also says you know then he said but don’t cry and her interpretation of that, her, the construction that she has of it is that he is rejecting her, shutting her out. We could wonder together what his other motives might have been maybe he’s really protecting her or he doesn’t want to make her sad again and this might be in his own way of loving response as well as a self protective one. She is focusing on one part of it that he is cold and won’t talk with me, that’s excuse me that's not going to move it forward if she can be… be aware that there might be multiple motivations that he has and one of them may be caring. She could be more tender to him. 

01:31:25
DIANE KJOS Hmm… hmm. 

01:31:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT Or she could just see that he is in pain, or she might be more tender at him he’s creating pain for her. She could be more compassionate, empathic. 

01:31:35
JON CARLSON One of the things that keep showing up in this interview is this idea should I stay or should I go. I don’t know if you stop and you think about this and you look back is she is going to stay or is she going to go? 

01:31:50
MICHAEL F. HOYT I left my crystal ball in my study at home. 

01:31:55
JON CARLSON Did you have any intuition about which direction she was headed and when you come back to that. In this next piece we’re going to see this leaving issue comes up again. 

01:32:05
MICHAEL F. HOYT I think that the fact that she is here and taking about it and where they are developmentally in their life cycle a crisis is coming to ahead and when this their last child leaves home and now it’s two of us we can’t focus on parenting it’s going to be very quiet in the living room and they’re going to have to decide what do we say to one another now and I think something will come to some kind of a head. 

01:32:35
JON CARLSON So following that model that you talked of earlier about the stages of change this is a pre-contemplation to contemplation and then in the action and… 

01:32:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT Right she is ramping up it's beginning to… to get to that point. 

01:32:45
JON CARLSON Let’s watch it in this next clip. 

01:32:50
MICHAEL F. HOYT Okay. 

01:32:50
TERRY And I could be, I’d like to think I could be pretty content, but it’s scary, it’s just you know to having knowing what you have, have been known is so much easier to deal with then the… the what ifs you know those are the… those are the big what ifs and I’m smart enough to know there’s a lot of really weird people out there and a lot of bad things happen to the people but not necessarily there is lot of nice places to be so it’s just getting the strength to say it's time or knowing when it's time. 

01:33:30
MICHAEL F. HOYT I may have already asked you before would tell you it’s time? 

01:33:35
TERRY I don’t know. 

01:33:40
JON CARLSON You seem to really be helping her to understand just how she makes decisions that she is you know that are going to be coming up quite quickly, is that your intent. 

01:33:50
MICHAEL F. HOYT I’m not sure I’m helping her to say…. her understand how she makes me as much as saying the time to hesitate is through. If you’re going to make a decision you’ve got to make a decision I’m sort of turning up the heat in a… in a sense. I think she is stewing with this and something has got to happen and I’m saying well you know if you go this way it’s not going to be good enough if you go that way and whichever way you go there will be a problem but it doesn’t sound like the way the status isn’t very satisfying to leave it were it is. 

01:34:25
JON CARLSON As we move on in… in looking at the video, the next part we're going to look at this is about 10 minutes out and… and you actually say we have got about 10 minutes left and then she kind of turns the table she wants to know about you. She wants to find out about your life. 

01:34:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yeah I thought that was very interesting and it is part of sort of managing the session I’m so I’m trying to keep track of we will get only a few minutes left what’s next, what do you want to use this time, what’s the take home message, next steps and so I say how do you want to use this time and she turns and asks me and I tried to situate her curiosity in terms of her issues. I said I’ll try to answer but I’m also wondering why of all the things you could ask your… you are wondering this particular thing because that may give for some clues into her process. 

01:35:20
JON CARLSON Lets watch how you handle that. 

01:35:20
MICHAEL F. HOYT Okay. 

01:35:20
TERRY They… they took it very hard so… 

01:35:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT I see, hmm… hmm. 

01:35:25
TERRY So I… 

01:35:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT And we have… we have got about 10 minutes left in our conversation here. How do you want to use the time? 

01:35:30
TERRY Well I guess I’d would like to know how what brought you to being who you are because I… I can’t imagine that you don’t feel somehow burdened or weighted down by the… by the things that people tell you and… and you want to help and sometimes you must want to hit just smack people and say, you fool listen to me, it must be hard not… not to say that but I'll… but what brought to your… what brought you to being what you are in as a therapist. What brought you to think you could help people or… or have you have found success? You must have found success. 

01:36:25
MICHAEL F. HOYT I’ll… I'll try to answer your question and I’m not trying to avoid it but I’m curious why that’s what… why that's your question? Why… why would you want to know that about me? 

01:36:40
TERRY Because I’m always curious how people get where they are you know what kind… I don’t say what kind of breaks people had but what kinds of you know what steps along the way. 

01:36:55
MICHAEL F. HOYT Is it partly because you are kind of at a turning point and trying to figure how other people move forward or got through things. 

01:37:00
TERRY Yeah and partly because I think so much of what we do is chance, not… not… not by saying you know chance but… but just being in the… being at a place at a time when something happened you took this path instead of this path maybe. 

01:37:20
MICHAEL F. HOYT Hmm…hmm. I agree with you I think of a fair amount of life is chance who you meet at a certain time, what you hear and sometimes things happen by chance. I think we become persons by making personal decisions. When there is a situation where we see options when we have to choose that’s when our character comes out so we make ourselves rather than just it was given to me or it fell into my lap or something like that. And as a therapist I mean I have a history like everyone that I went here and I studied there and I heard this and that sort of thing, but I’ve become very interested in how people, sorry your question, how people put their story together, how they understand themselves in their world and how they sometimes come to a point where there conscious of it and they can make a choice so you asked about isn't burdening, if it was just hearing people be unhappy or I’m in pain or I’m confused that will be terrible to leave even more than burdening, it will be depressing of the one after the other, but the exciting part of is… is hearing people who have a problem but then seeing how they solve it in the way and maybe even assisting them in some way or suggesting if you looked at this way here’s another thing or just being there encouraging them or so seeing people, let me use a cliché, get better you know kind of resolve their problems. 

01:39:05
JON CARLSON Oh Michael I guess my comment is this is crystal ball time again. What do you think or what do you hope your response accomplished with Terry? 

01:39:20
MICHAEL F. HOYT I think right at the beginning when she asked the question I wondered if partly if she was asking if I really talked about myself more genuinely would that be too burdensome for people am I painful, am I depressing could you really take it if I kind of let know what really troubling if I kind of went pass… 

01:39:45
DIANE KJOS That made driving you away like I do my husband. 

01:39:50
MICHAEL F. HOYT Am I driving you away and do I have that impact on people. She is asking what impact do I have on people or is it a story like mine or presentation like mine have which could be once again an invitation to looking at a relationships and how what impact she does have. I’m hoping that what I’m doing there is at least planting the seeds the ideas of needing to make a decision and that if you resolve this it won’t be a burden, it will be… it will be excitement. 

01:40:25
JON CARLSON And in a few minutes in this next clip we are going to watch you do move on with addressing the decision making process with her again, so why don't we move to that clip. 

01:40:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT It’s so I’m curious if we had more time to talk how you decided to put your life together like this, how much was chance and just sort of fell into it, but if there have been times when oh I… I do have a choice if I do it this way or I do it that way, why you chose what you chose and then if it works God bless you go for it, but the extent that it's is not working sometimes we oh I could do something different, this may work for a while or kind of work but now it’s not working that its so I'd be curious kind of how you are going to resolve it or how you’re going to re-solve it or what you going to have to do different and it sounds like one possibility would be to doing well, I’ll let it happen you know and… and.. and maybe something will happen a miracle will happen or you know prince charming will ride in or he’ll die and I’ll have a big insurance settlement no one will blame me or I don’t know I mean I just want possibilities it could sort of solve itself. But I doubt if that is going to happen any time soon. I think you’re going to need this to… to… to take responsibility we going to have to say I’ve got to do something with my life. If you choose to go one way or another way that’s okay, you may say you know we took the whole thing and I don’t want to, what you call turn over the apple cart or its nor worth it financially and socially and my parents would I don’t want to go through or you might say yeah I will be financial and social and my parents won’t understand and they will be upset but to thane own self be true, I think I’ve got to do this I don’t think there’s a sort of a long answer to the question of how I got into being the therapist I think it’s, I’m interested in other things as well, but I think people are just wonderful and it’s how people become who they are and how they construct their view of… of themselves and was how they see their world and some of it certainly in your history you got trained in these values and you met these people and you’ve had these opportunities and you have read these books (inaudible ) professors and all of that kind of thing, some of its genetics some of its how we grow up, but then is a point where we also have choice, we say I'll get those are all true that’s my history but now it’s time to what am I going to do. I got to step up or I got to, now is I do have a moment of choice here and that’s where. 

01:43:20
TERRY And that’s scary, choices is so scary. 

01:43:20
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yeah. 

01:43:20
TERRY Yeah. 

01:43:20
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yeah. 

01:43:20
TERRY Yeah. 

01:43:25
JON CARLSON This is really an interesting segment when you get into the choice and it almost sounds that you’re at this old Fritz Perl thing, you do your thing I’ll do my thing, you’re advocating that to her that she can make whatever choice she wants to make. Don’t therapist have some kind of moral obligation to have her honor these commitments that she has made, I mean she has made a commitment to her husband, she has made a commitment to her child. Is… that within you know your domain? 

01:44:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT She certainly mentioned somewhere one of the things that hold her back is guilt and she is aware that she is violating commitments that she has made, she is not living up to her word and I think that’s something that needs to be explored with her. You are the one who mentioned Fritz Perl so I’m not saying to her just do your thing whatever you want to do, if it feels good go for it I’m not sure Fritz Perl said either and I only met him once. We didn’t talk about that but I think there’s certainly is a moral dimension that needs to be though about there’s a large controversy in our… in our field should we advocate for marriages and families, is anything goes and our job is just to be a sort of neutral and a technician to help people get what they want. I think we need to at least make people aware of there is a moral dimension and help them sort that one out. It’s very interesting to me how on this episode and the one we watched just before she is very attentive, she is really interested she is listening very closely to what I’m going to say. You asked me what I thought her response was I should have asked her what you're doing with what I’m saying, were rather than having a dialogue I think we’re talking at one another it’s part of the narcissistic process it kind of brings the views back and forth rather than we are not working with each other’s input, so I would better going to ask her how she is taking what I’m saying and in what meaning she takes out of it then work with around her this meanings. 

01:45:45
JON CARLSON Well in the final clip you do that and that’s as you being to wrap up this session you being to ask her specifically just how has this meeting been helpful, lets watch that. 

01:45:55
MICHAEL F. HOYT Okay. 

01:45:55
TERRY Yeah sturdy… sturdy… 

01:46:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT You can take care of yourself. We are going to stop in just one minute or so. Can you give me little feedback has this been helpful, in what way and if its? 

01:46:05
TERRY Well I was hoping you had your magic wand stuck somewhere in the back of your… of your shirt but I think you’ve said what… what… what you had to say which is that it’s in me and I have to find it and… and you know I have to and I guess I needed to be told that, I mean if you don’t have a crystal ball then and this is your job then I guess there isn't a crystal ball and I’ve got to find my own crystal ball or a magic wand. 

01:46:35
JON CARLSON So it sounds like she ended up really needing to take some responsibility for this whole dilemma. 

01:46:40
MICHAEL F. HOYT Hmm…hmm. You know there’s sort of two levels there on the one hand yes she needs to take some responsibility but she’s also saying I have to solve the problem all within myself rather than saying I can be vulnerable to somebody else I can relate to somebody else there’s outside of the person. Input, that could be valuable to me. I don’t want her to have to close her eyes literally and figuratively and say I’ve got to solve this all within because that would isolate her again, that’s in a sense what she is doing with her husband. She instead of trying to connect to him she's trying to figure out in herself what to do how to talk differently. 

01:47:25
DIANE KJOS Absolutely and she is looking for magic in a way that somehow and then… then the… the fact that the magic isn’t there then she has to struggle some more and rather than reach out for others and that type of thing, that her relationship tough enough for her is… is tough. 

01:47:45
MICHAEL F. HOYT Yes. I think so. 

01:47:45
JON CARLSON Well I appreciate the opportunity to watch you work with Terry are then final comments that you might have as you reflect back on this session. 

01:47:55
MICHAEL F. HOYT We have spent a lot of time going through and my saying I wish I had done this and noticing things were wrong or difficult and not spending as much time looking at the strengths of Terry does have and I think that’s perhaps an art affect of this particular interview and the situation that occurred in. I think it’s going to be important and one of principles of Brief Therapy is very much trying to draw some clients strengths and resources of finding or what her theory of changes what would be helpful to her. We have something to offer but I think we need to do much more else of trying to bring forward the best of Terry rather than just noting the problems that she is having. 

01:48:40
JON CARLSON It might just be an artifact of our times Michael that we were in this time of transition moving from problem focused to more solution positive focused and we all have those habits they keep us focused back on the problems and our language supports that and I really appreciate you pointing this out to us and continuing to help us grow towards that goal. Thank you. 

01:49:00
MICHAEL F. HOYT That’s why when we… you're welcome and that why I think it’s important to notice your noticing notice what you are paying attention to of all the ways were are organizing our experiences of this interview or any interview why am I looking at it this way, is it my pet theory is it the energy of the client is this going to serve the client in the best way because we all have lenses, we all have epistemologies I can’t function without them. I think it’s important to recognize that there is many ways to look at the situation and to try to look for ways that, ways of looking, that will get the client more of what the client ultimately wants. 

01:49:40
JON CARLSON Again thank you Michael. 

01:49:40
DIANE KJOS Thank you.
