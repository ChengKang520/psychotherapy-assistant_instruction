ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in your trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily harness calm do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is The Un-forgiveness Hook. The basis of this practice was developed by Steven Hayes and posted to psychology tools. Let's start by reflecting on the metaphor of the Hook and the words by Hayes. Let's practice together. Un-forgiveness, being in un-forgiveness is like being on a giant hook. Next to you on the hook is the person who has hurt you. The hook is extremely painful. Wherever you go, so does the hook and solace the offending(ph). The only way to get off the hook is if you allow the offender off first. The cost to not allowing the offender off the hook is perhaps a lifetime of unhappiness. Reflect on these words for release. "I am ready to unhook myself from the person who has hurt me." Practice this again throughout the day, whenever you need to recapture feeling of comfort or calm. Take the time right now to form a new healthy practice habit. Take a small step in right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky, from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
