Three Approaches to Marriage Counseling with One Couple 

00:00:35
Edward E. Hamann, Ed.D. Faculty Emeritus Department of Counselor Education Western Illinois University 

00:00:45
EDWARD HAMANN I'm Doctor Ed Hamann, what you are about to watch is a demonstration of three approaches to couples counseling. Approaches that are really quite different from each other. The demonstrations will be with a couple, Amber and Zach, who in real life are not married to each other, but who will be role-playing a married couple. I will be demonstrating solution focused therapy, my colleague doctor Holly Nichols will be demonstrating logo therapy, and my colleague doctor Shawn Parmenon will demonstrate emotionally focused therapy. Here's how this process is going to go. First of all, Holly, Shawn, and I will each give a brief overview of the therapy model that we are going to be demonstrating. I do encourage you to do research and reading on your own on the therapy model and the theorist associated with them. Secondly each of us will conduct an approximately 30 minute demonstration of our chosen therapy model. Following each demonstration, we will offer some of our thoughts about how the session went. At the end of all three of these demonstrations, Amber and Zach will join Holly, Shawn and me and offer feedback and reactions about the overall experience. It is my hope that you will find what you are about to watch to be both a unique and a useful learning opportunity. As well as perhaps a stimulus for you for additional questions and discussion about couples counseling. I want to close my introductory remarks by thanking Amber and Zach for their participation in this project. Their time and help in making the project possible is truly greatly appreciated.

Solution Focused Therapy with Dr. Ed Hamann 

00:03:00
EDWARD HAMANN Well now I'm gonna move into my brief overview of solution focused therapy. As I'm sure most of you know, this therapy model was developed by the late Steve Deshazier (ph) and in Ian Sue Kenburg (ph) in the 1970s at the Brief Family Therapy Center in Milwaukee. Bill O'Handlien (ph), Michelle Wienherd Davis (ph), John Walter, Jane Peller (ph), among others have written extensively about solution focused therapy. Here are some basic concepts of this model of therapy. It is oriented, oriented toward the future and what is possible for clients. Neither the past nor the present are important for discussion. Deshazier even said it is not necessary to know what the problem is, in order to solve it. He also said, and I really like, this, small changes lead to big changes. Solution focused therapy is very client-focused. The client chooses the goals, the counselor is regarded as a co-collaborator with what it is that the clients want to work on. Deshazier described three types of clients, and I really like the terminology that he used in this regard. First of all he talked about a client being a visitor. And this client comes to counseling really unable to identify a specific complaint or goal. There is indeed no problem needing counseling. This kind of client, the visitor, probably was sent to counseling by someone else. The second type of client according to Deshazier is known as the complainant. Here problems and goals and changes are clearly developed, but they are dependent on someone else making changes. These kinds of clients, the complainants can certainly come in and expound upon what the difficulty is, but again what the difficulty and the changes reside with someone else. In dealing with the complainant, I would say it's best to bring along the additional person to counseling in order to try to affect change. Excuse me. The third kind of client according to this model is the customer. And of the course the customer is the kind of client that we would probably prefer to come to our counseling offices. The customer owns the problem, is willing to take action, and work toward change. Now I would say to you it is possible to make customers out of visitors and complainants. A few techniques in terms of solution focused therapy uh, the techniques consist basically of series of questions. First of all, there is the miracle question. The miracle question helps the client identify what it is that they would like to be different, as a result of counseling. Second kind of question is simply what else. What else helps the client expand their description of what it is that they would like to be different. The third question to be used in this model is called the exception finding question. This identifies times when solutions to the problem have already been present, or when the problem is not a problem. And lastly this model uses something called scaling questions, which can be used for identifying problems severity, or perhaps commitment to change. In conclusion I would say in doing counseling I have found solution focused therapy to be a very optimistic model of counseling. It is indeed a glass half full way of feeling, both for dealing with our clients, and I think in terms of a general philosophy to operate from. It is now time for me to conduct the demonstration of solution focused therapy with our couple Amber and Zach. Well Amber and Zach thank you for, uh, meeting with me today. I'd like to begin by just asking, uh a few question so that we can get acquainted a little bit, if you wouldn't mind telling me how old each of you is? 

00:08:00
AMBER Um, I'm 30. 

00:08:00
EDWARD HAMANN Okay, Zach? 

00:08:00
ZACH I'm 28. 

00:08:00
EDWARD HAMANN Okay, and are you both employed? 

00:08:05
AMBER We are. 

00:08:05
EDWARD HAMANN Okay, what is it that you do? 

00:08:10
AMBER Um, well, me I actually started my own company, I own, uh, Boutique in the area. 

00:08:15
EDWARD HAMANN Oh, what do you sell at your Boutique? 

00:08:15
AMBER Just clothing, jewelry, um, just kind of geared more towards uh, ladies apparel and some children stuff. 

00:08:25
EDWARD HAMANN Oh wow, that sounds very, and you say this is fairly new for you. 

00:08:25
AMBER Uh, yes, very new, so something that, uh, I always was interested in, but just kind of just recently decided to take on, so. 

00:08:35
EDWARD HAMANN Interesting, how's it going? 

00:08:35
AMBER Um, uh, it's been better. It's been hard with the economy and things that, financially I wasn't quite expecting with it. I guess, which. 

00:08:50
EDWARD HAMANN Oh yeah, lotta pressure going on, yeah. 

00:08:50
AMBER Yes, yes. 

00:08:50
EDWARD HAMANN Hard getting started, I'm sure. 

00:08:55
AMBER It was definitely, definitely difficult getting started, and looking back on it now I wish I would've known a little bit more about how much work would go into it. So. 

00:09:05
EDWARD HAMANN And Zach what is it that you do? 

00:09:05
ZACH I have a law degree. And I'm an injury lawyer. 

00:09:10
EDWARD HAMANN Oh, how's that going for you? 

00:09:15
ZACH Uh, it's going pretty well, I'm trying to work my way up, hopefully, you know my goal is to be a partner with the firm. But that's kinda taxing on my family, cause it's some long days, long hours, and um, there've been times where I've stayed at work overnight, just because you know I just wanted to stay on top of things, because I'm really hoping to accomplish this goal. I figure, you know, provide a better lifestyle for my family, so, you know, long hours but I love my job. You know my family we come from a background of lawyers, I guess you could kinda say it's the family business. But, you know, it's, I enjoy my job, enjoy my work, and you know really dedicated to it. 

00:09:55
EDWARD HAMANN What I'm hearing is that you're both really in some pressured situations here, occupationally, and uh, really sounds like it has some impact on your relationship. 

00:10:05
AMBER Definitely, I mean I would say- 

00:10:10
ZACH We have our issues, but you know. 

00:10:10
AMBER It's definitely been a struggle, and something that we've tried really hard to work out on our own, um, but we just can't quite seem to make that work, and, and figure out a way to find a happy medium, between work and life. 

00:10:30
EDWARD HAMANN Sure, well let me come back to that for a moment, in a moment, um, uh, how long have the two of you been married? 

00:10:35
AMBER Five years. 

00:10:35
EDWARD HAMANN Five years, okay. And any children? 

00:10:35
AMBER I have, actually, a 10 year old son, uh, from a previous relationship. 

00:10:40
EDWARD HAMANN Okay, and he lives with the two of you? 

00:10:45
AMBER He does, um, it's actually uh, another issue um, that, has been a struggle pretty much since the beginning, um, he does not always get along with Zach. Just never quite seemed to quite jowl, and I don't know if there's resentment on his end, um actually on both ends, but it's very hard for me to, to see this happening and be in the middle and I don't know how to be there for both of them and bring them together. 

00:11:15
ZACH Yeah, he sees more me as kind of, I don't wanna say an enemy, but maybe like an authority figure, so not the most responsive, the most receptive towards me, which in turn frustrates me. And so, you know. That, that happens, so we're trying but him and I don't have the best relationship. 

00:11:35
AMBER And it, it's hard for me to hear, sometimes, when he talks about him, because I feel like our parenting skills are very different, um, in the way that I view parenting him, and you know we were on our own, for so long, and then he steps in and wants to be an authoritative figure, and it doesn't always go over so well. 

00:11:50
EDWARD HAMANN Sure, sure. Does your son see his father? 

00:11:55
AMBER Um, very once in a while, uh, not very often, um, when he tries to. I have full custody, so I mean it's gotten much better, um, his father and I don't have much of a relationship, but I try to, um, just for the sake of him and his well-being, our son, so but he, he doesn't live very close so that also makes it very difficult, so. 

00:12:20
EDWARD HAMANN I see, well you certainly indicated some pressures that you're having in the relationship, uh, uh, certainly the time commitment to each of your careers, and your son and the parenting impact and so let me just ask you, uh, quite point blank, I guess, if you could identify for me what you would like us to be able to work in our time together today, maybe it's related to those issues, maybe it's something else, but what it is that you would like for us to focus on today? 

00:12:55
AMBER Um, I think mainly just being able to get back to a place where we're not constantly arguing about my son or our work environment, but being able to figure out some way that we can get back to where we fell in love, or where things began for us. 

00:13:15
ZACH I'm sure like most couples, we weren't always like this. So, you know if we can get back to the way it was, you know, pre-marriage, you know where we would go see shows and have a good time and things like that. And I know a lot of it has to deal with because I work all the time. But if we could, you know manage it to get back, to get back to a place where it was like that, and um, still have time for one another, and also probably the issue I'm having the most issue, the trouble with is just trying to relate to our son and to let them know that I do care about him, and you know I'm not his biggest enemy, you know, so. 

00:13:55
AMBER We wanna be a happy cohesive family, just. 

00:13:55
ZACH We wanna make this work. You know the alternative is something we don't wanna do, so. 

00:14:00
EDWARD HAMANN I really hear that, there's a commitment that you're expressing toward each other, certainly. 

00:14:05
AMBER Yes. 

00:14:05
EDWARD HAMANN Let me ask you perhaps a bit of an odd question, but let's imagine, that uh, you know we conduct our time together and you go on about the rest of your day, and but eventually this day is over and you go to bed tonight and go to sleep, tomorrow morning, you wake up and a miracle's happened, such that these issues you're concerned about are gone? What would you notice would be going on differently, what would each of you perhaps be doing differently that would make you say, geeze I think a miracle happened. 

00:14:40
ZACH First and foremost, I'd probably be at home, first, you know. 

00:14:45
AMBER Uh, yeah, that would, definitely probably be the main thing, would be waking, up, oh, he's here, it's a miracle- 

00:14:50
EDWARD HAMANN So you mean, you mean indeed in the morning, you woke up, you'd wake up together? Uh-huh. 

00:14:55
AMBER Yes, I mean yeah that never happens, and to you know have, uh, Rufus my son just be, you know happy, and getting ready for school. 

00:15:05
ZACH It'd probably freak him out, see me there, it's like what are you doing here, dude? Why are you here? 

00:15:10
EDWARD HAMANN So Rufus would see you together and he'd see you kinda laughing and getting along, is that what you're saying? 

00:15:15
AMBER Yes, that would be amazing. To start a full day on a good note, would be amazing. 

00:15:20
EDWARD HAMANN When you say start the day on a good note, what does that mean? What does that mean, what would be happening? 

00:15:25
AMBER Um, I guess I would just say to, no yelling, no arguing, and- 

00:15:30
ZACH I could make breakfast- 

00:15:35
AMBER On my part, I would feel I wouldn't have to, uh, sometimes it's hard, I feel like I have to nag my son, and I'm getting him to get ready, and get going for school, but then I'm also on him, be home at this time, are you gonna be home for dinner, are you gonna be a part of our lives today or not, and I don't ever get clear answers. 

00:15:55
ZACH We could talk over breakfast, she doesn't like to cook, so- 

00:15:55
AMBER I'm not a good one. 

00:15:55
ZACH No, she doesn't like to cook, so- 

00:15:55
AMBER That I can admit. 

00:16:00
ZACH We could talk over breakfast, and then you know see what we wanna do with our day, or what we have planned for the day, or just, just talk, to be in part, you know part of each other's lives. 

00:16:10
EDWARD HAMANN Yeah, yeah. Now let me be sure I got this, because I think you're saying some important things here, so if this miracle happened, and you woke up tomorrow, uh, first of all, you would wake up together, that would be part of the miracle, um, there would be no yelling going on, there might even be some laughing, Rufus would see the two of you together, um, you'd make breakfast, and um, maybe talk as you're sharing breakfast, is that the kinds of things, this miracle- 

00:16:35
AMBER That sounds pretty amazing to me, it does, yeah. 

00:16:40
ZACH I make some mean pancakes. That would be awesome. 

00:16:45
EDWARD HAMANN What else, would tell you that this miracle happened? 

00:16:50
AMBER Um, I'd probably just say, our general, just demeanor towards each other, uh, I mean it feels like we're constantly in a state of pent up, a lot of anger, or, uh, aggression towards each other, I, I don't know I just, I don't wanna feel this way towards him anymore. 

00:17:10
ZACH I may speak for, probably stress, you know, it would probably relieve stress, bring down tension, make things more relaxed, she probably won't feel like she has to do everything. You know and then I, she could see me, you know, helping her out, not just at work all the time, thinking about how I'm going to improve my you know, work situation, she'll see me at home, she'll see me that, I care about both of them- 

00:17:35
AMBER Being part of the family, actually- 

00:17:35
ZACH Right, and she doesn't have to feel like, because I hear all the time, why do I have to do everything, so it feels like she feels like she has to do everything, so she probably sees me being around, helping out, and you know, telling them both that, you know, I'm here for you both. You know, I'm just at work because I'm trying to make that situation better, so. And I'm a workaholic, it shouldn't be that way, but that's the situation I'm in right now. 

00:18:00
AMBER And I understand that, in the long run, and I hear this a lot too is, I'm doing this for the family, I'm doing it for you- 

00:18:05
ZACH I always say I promise it'll get better, I promise it'll get better. 

00:18:10
AMBER It just never seems to get better. And I understand the end game and the point of all of it, but in the meantime, I mean, when, when do I get to have him? 

00:18:20
ZACH She needs some results. Tangible evidence that she could say, okay, it's getting better because of this. 

00:18:25
EDWARD HAMANN But what would that look like, Zach? 

00:18:30
ZACH Well, as I mentioned, I probably wouldn't be home as much, you know and then I'd have more- 

00:18:30
EDWARD HAMANN You would not be home? 

00:18:35
ZACH Oh I'm sorry, be at work as much. I misspoke, I wouldn't be at work as much. And then we would have time to do things. She wants to travel, she loves to travel, she loves to go places, I could take them somewhere, you know, we could go out west, Rufus isn't of age, but I know she loves Las Vegas. You know we could hang out there. And you know we would just have more time to do family things. I like to travel to, so there's things I would like to see too but in this situation I'm in right now, you know there's, I know she has a list of things she would like to do, things she'd like to see, and it's just not ideal right now because you know I'm working all the time. 

00:19:05
EDWARD HAMANN Right, well again, you've articulated what some of these miracle pieces, and what some of these solutions would look like, and I think you've done a very good job of that. Let me ask you when some of these pieces exist, you see I can't believe that it's bad all the time, I suspect that at times there are some of the pieces of the miracle happening, so you know tell me when that happens, when do some of these things actually take place? 

00:19:35
AMBER Uh, well usually like uh, I would say, either in like the late evenings, maybe- 

00:19:40
ZACH There are times I get to take her out to dinner, she likes that. 

00:19:40
AMBER Yeah, that I do very much enjoy and a lot of times when it is just me and him, it can be okay. I mean we can move past that and it's just, and but I don't wanna, you know, I wanna include my son, you know he's very much a part of my life and our lives, and it just, you know it feels like a lot of times that it's can be very disjointed and uh, I don't know I mean I guess like sometimes on the weekends when he can feel when he doesn't have work that's bled into the weekends, we can actually feel like a family. 

00:20:15
EDWARD HAMANN Mm-hm, when would you say maybe was the last time that you went out to dinner together or the weekend was pleasant, when did that last happen? 

00:20:25
ZACH It's been some time, hasn't it? 

00:20:30
AMBER Two months ago, maybe- 

00:20:30
ZACH Yeah, it's been some time. So, and I know she likes these things and I'm not trying to, um, for lack of a word, neglect her, but at the same time, I'm at work all the time, so I understand this, I know this, and I'm, I think she understands it too, you know it's just, it's just the life situation, and she's a good one for sticking around and saying you know, this is what I wanna know what's happening and she's not the happiest with this right now, so you know, it's nice of her to understand that this is going on, and as we're trying to work towards a life that we would like to have. 

00:21:10
EDWARD HAMANN Right, right, let me go into a little bit of a different direction again, and perhaps ask a question that may sound odd again, but you know I think you're sort of zeroing in on, on time and, and uh, the ability to spend time together, and, and to be able to relax. Uh, if you were to think of a scale of one to 10, and 10 is these problems are about as bad as they can be. And one is, we don't have any problems, where would each of you put yourself on that scale of one to 10? 

00:21:40
ZACH One specific problem, or just life in general? 

00:21:40
EDWARD HAMANN The general things you've been talking about, the time and the pressures, if you can just kinda lump it together and tell me you know where you put yourself on that scale. 

00:21:55
AMBER At times it being absolute worst- 

00:21:55
ZACH 10's like we hit rock bottom. 

00:21:55
AMBER I mean, I wouldn't say that we've hit rock bottom just, at least not 10, I mean, obviously, I mean we're here- 

00:22:05
ZACH Right, yeah, you're right, right. 

00:22:05
AMBER And so, I mean if we're not divorced, so I would say that that would be a 10, so I guess like, I don't know an eight, maybe. 

00:22:15
ZACH I was probably leaning towards a seven or eight, realistically as well. 

00:22:15
EDWARD HAMANN Okay, so kind of both see the severity at about the same level, seven and a half, eight. Now, as specifically as you can tell me, Amber, let me begin with you. Tell me something that would, that you could do, that you could do that would move you from an eight to a seven on that scale, in terms of these issues that you're concerned about. 

00:22:45
AMBER Just a small difference, I guess? 

00:22:45
EDWARD HAMANN Yeah, something small. 

00:22:45
ZACH Something she could do, or something I could do? 

00:22:45
EDWARD HAMANN Something Amber could do. 

00:22:50
AMBER I guess I could easily ask you more about what you're feeling towards your work and why your stressed out. I mean I do feel like sometimes I focus so much on what's going on with me at home, and my issues, and Rufus, that I don't ask you enough. 

00:23:10
ZACH And your shop. 

00:23:10
AMBER And the shop. So I think that's something that I could, I could easily do. 

00:23:15
EDWARD HAMANN Inquire more about Zach's, okay, what else, maybe something again, small that you could do that would kinda work on some of these issues? 

00:23:25
AMBER I could take you out sometimes? 

00:23:30
ZACH Nice, nice. 

00:23:30
AMBER Maybe suggest something that we can do together instead of relying on you to do those things. 

00:23:35
ZACH It's been a while since we've been to a concert. 

00:23:40
AMBER Long time. Since we've done things like that. 

00:23:40
ZACH Yeah. 

00:23:45
EDWARD HAMANN For you to move from an eight to a seven, if you were to inquire about how Zach's day is, and his work, and maybe present something specific that the two of you could do together, maybe a concert, maybe go out to eat, but you would bring that up. In your mind, you think that would just move down a notch on that scale. 

00:24:05
AMBER I think so, I can see that, definitely, helping. 

00:24:10
EDWARD HAMANN Something you could do, Zach, as specifically as you can tell me, to move you from that seven and a half to a six and half, just one notch. 

00:24:20
ZACH Uh, stop putting work first. Put my family first. And have my, excuse my language, butt home more. To support my family, and you know she talked about inquiring, I'm pretty sure that I'm guilty of never asking about how the shop's going. You know, and that probably is not a good thing, okay probably, no it's not a good thing. So, you know I could just find out how she's going, how her family's doing. And really make a more concerted effort to find some kind commonplace between Rufus and I, because I know dude likes to play video games. And I'm video-, and so, I love video games too, I figure, there's just an effort of, trying to make things better instead of saying I'm at work, I need to do work, I'm so close to getting this, at the firm, and you know, work's going to be there when I get back, I don't have to finish it all in a fourteen hour marathon sitting. So. If I'm looking at it realistically, that's probably what I should be doing. 

00:25:35
EDWARD HAMANN Mmhmm, so again, just so I'm with you on the same page here, for you to move from a seven and a half to a six and a half, you would stop putting work first, put family first, that's a little general, but I get the idea, but maybe a piece of that would be as you said, you would ask Amber about her work, and how the shop is going. And uh, and spend some time with Rufus, playing video games- 

00:26:00
ZACH Or something of his interest, music, or sports-, I just know he's really into video games. But you know whether it's comics, or um, something on TV, or something at school he has really going on, I know that he's into music, so if he has some type of instrument he's into, or something like that, or, you know, if we wanna go to a museum or something, just to see what he wants to do. 

00:26:25
AMBER These things would be huge to him. 

00:26:25
EDWARD HAMANN Really? How would it be for you? 

00:26:30
AMBER Uh, I mean I would love to see that. I mean I've never seen just the two of them do something. I don't know ever, all right- 

00:26:40
ZACH Because it probably hasn't happened, that's why she hasn't seen it. 

00:26:45
AMBER Yeah, I mean it would be wonderful to see you take an interest in his interest. And I think that would go far for him, I mean he's just becoming a teenager, and stuff, you know, seems like the world to him. So. 

00:26:55
EDWARD HAMANN You look like that would be very important to you. 

00:26:55
AMBER It would be very important, yeah, it would. It would mean a lot, so. 

00:27:00
EDWARD HAMANN I see that on your face. Go throw another to 10 at you, because you, you just sat here, past couple minutes and identified some, you know relatively small things that you're saying would move you that one positive notch, okay, you've each come up with something. So my questions to you is again think of one to 10, and this is your commitment to putting those things into action, doing those things that you just said would contribute to some reduction into stress. So let's say that 10 is absolutely, I Amber am gonna do this, and I Zach, am gonna do those things, and I'm gonna begin those when I leave this session today. So 10 is, it's gonna happen, and one is, you know those are nice ideas, but there ain't no chance it's gonna happen. Where are each of you if you put yourself on that scale? 

00:28:00
AMBER Um, I think that I can definitely commit to at least a nine, at the very least, as long as I can see that we're both trying to make an effort, I can definitely do that. 

00:28:10
EDWARD HAMANN Okay. You're a nine, Zach? 

00:28:15
ZACH The hardest thing for me and she's not gonna like hearing this, the hardest thing for me is just the commitment at work. Um, I'm going to say a six, that this is going to happen. Um, I want it to happen, I do, but the realism of it happening immediately, is probably a little difficult, but I want to try to do this, I don't wanna stay at a six, I want it to go up to a nine or a 10, I do. But the boss is at work, and at this law firm, it's a very prestigious firm. Lucky to be a part of it, so I gotta put my time in there, and I'm not trying to upset you. I'm not trying to- 

00:29:00
EDWARD HAMANN I have to ask you about that look on your face, what's going on- 

00:29:05
ZACH I know I can feel her look, that's why I wasn't looking over there- 

00:29:05
AMBER I just feel like this is the same thing, we go through this over and over again, and this isn't the first time that I've heard, oh I can try to be at work less, or think about work less, I'm just asking for an inch, just a little. 

00:29:25
ZACH And my answer was just, to be honest, I didn't wanna, I didn't wanna overshoot and say yes, have a nine, and tomorrow comes around, and she notices, you know, yeah- 

00:29:30
EDWARD HAMANN -appreciate, but let me come back to you, cause I know that you are being honest, and uh, I can see the disappointment in Amber's face. But let's come at it this way. Do you know in your head what you wanna do, it's kinda the doing it, is the hard part. What of those things that you listed do you think would be the first thing that maybe be the easiest to do? 

00:29:55
ZACH The easiest thing to do would be to try to take more of an interest in Rufus' activities. Um, just seeing him, and then putting forth an effort to want to understand what he's doing, instead of just saying, hey, how's it going, eating dinner, and that's that. Like try to have a conversation with him, and I don't know if he'll be resistant at first, and if he was, I wouldn't blame him, because this is probably going to be a significant change for him, and he's a smart dude, so he might pick up on this, like what are you trying to do here. But at the same time, you know, my patience and showing her and him that I wanna be interested, and so when he's in his room playing his Wii, and you know he's playing Mariokart, and I try to jump in on it, you know hopefully he won't get up, turn it off and be like, we're done here. You know, don't want that to happen. 

00:30:45
AMBER I don't, I think that he would just-, I mean he might be shocked, uh, I'm not gonna lie- 

00:30:45
ZACH I'm get-, he'll get that wide-eyed look like. What are you doing, man? 

00:30:50
AMBER But I think, I think that he will be receptive to that, I really do, especially if you show a genuine interest, and not like a, hey, let's you know you wanna do something? 

00:31:00
ZACH Yeah, might as well take you out, let's go. 

00:31:00
AMBER Yeah, I mean, he's 10. 

00:31:05
EDWARD HAMANN Amber, what was your reaction to sort of that adjustment in, in the uh, the goal that Zach made, and not an adjustment, but and I asked him to pick which one might be, what was your reaction to that? 

00:31:20
AMBER Um, I definitely, I can see that, that that would be the easier step to take at first, and I know, and I realize that the work stuff will come. Um, but I, I, I like that, and I think that if can make that effort, and put forth a higher effort towards that first, that goes a long way with me, and that will ease tension throughout the whole house, the whole family. So, I mean I think that'll help a great deal. 

00:31:45
EDWARD HAMANN All right, bear with me here, Zach, I gotta ask you another one, so you, you sort of picked from your list the, you know- 

00:31:55
ZACH Fire! 

00:31:55
EDWARD HAMANN -The thing that maybe you could do most easily, so spending some time with, with Rufus, so again, scaling of one to 10, your commitment to doing that with Rufus, 10 is just gonna happen. 

00:32:05
ZACH 10 is the best. 

00:32:05
EDWARD HAMANN Where are you gonna put yourself on that scale? 

00:32:10
ZACH With, playing the video games? 

00:32:10
EDWARD HAMANN 10, is it's gonna happen, one is, again it's a nice idea, but there ain't no chance. 

00:32:15
ZACH If he wants to play, I'm down, put down like a 9.5. Okay, because I will play, I will play the video games with him, I might still have the work suit and tie on, and look like a huge geek to him, and I wear glasses when I work, so, you know I have my glasses on, and you know he might, it might look foreign to him, but I will play the games with him. We can do that. 

00:32:40
EDWARD HAMANN All right, well let me, I get to be sort of a stickler about details sometimes, so let me kinda review here. Um, things Amber, that you're gonna try to work on are asking Zach about his work, perhaps presenting, well not perhaps, you're gonna present something to Zach about an activity that you can do together. And you're like at a nine about that. 

00:33:00
AMBER I am, yes. 

00:33:05
EDWARD HAMANN Okay, and Zach, you kinda, you identified some things about putting the family first, um, asking about Amber's work, and then you said spending time with Rufus, and, and among those you thought the place that you would start would be coming home and spending some time with Rufus, and you've committed to about a 9 and half on that scale, is that, am I getting this all together here? 

00:33:25
AMBER Yeah. 

00:33:30
ZACH Yeah, that's, that's right. Because I mean I've known her longer, and I think she can deal with me a little bit more, I need to make a relationship with Rufus, you know to make that work, so. 

00:33:40
AMBER Yes, that's, that does need to be a huge step, so. 

00:33:40
EDWARD HAMANN Feel like I'm asking you a lot of weird questions, and we're gonna stop here pretty soon, we're about running out of time, and I'm gonna ask you one more. This is again a one to 10, and this is your commitment to this marriage scale. And 10 regardless of all that's going on, all the problems the issues, 10 is you are in this thing for the long haul. One is, I'm out the door and down the street, see you later. 

00:34:10
ZACH I'm already out the door, you say I'm already out the door with that. 

00:34:10
AMBER Stop. 

00:34:15
EDWARD HAMANN Where would you put yourself on that commitment to the marriage scale? 

00:34:20
AMBER I, I, I am very committed to this relationship. Um, I'm a 10, I would say a 10, I'm here, I want this to work. And I will do what it takes to make this marriage work. 

00:34:35
ZACH This is a great woman, and I'd be an absolute idiot if I said anything lower than a 10, so we'll go with 10 on this one, because you know I married her for a reason, and when you get married, that's it. Even though I'm in law, I'm not the biggest fan of divorce or believe in divorce. So, you know. I, I know she's frustrated, and I'm thankful she's being extra patient about it, because she is, I mean she is, we're coming and speaking to professionals, and then she talks to her friends, you know her mom, she talks to her mom and sister all the time. You know and I'm sure that um her dad, my father in law, who and I would get along well, haven't been getting along the greatest because she's been upset, and that's understandable, you know I get that, and um her sister Lauren, and her mom, uh, Janice and I used to have a pretty good relationship, it's a little strained now, because of her frustrations, but you know, I wanna turn around where we can and you know I wanna be committed to her. So, absolutely. 

00:35:35
EDWARD HAMANN Well I really hear some, some encouraging things in our time together. I think one, you've been very clear about what you would to be different. Two, you've been able to articulate some things you could do to make this different, and thirdly and probably most importantly is you are committed to each other in this relationship, and with that commitment I think comes uh, uh, the desire to work on the issues, so uh, I wish you well with that I hope these things can work out for both of you and I appreciate you talking with me today. 

00:36:15
AMBER Thank you. 

00:36:15
ZACH Thank you very much. 

00:36:15
AMBER Thank you. 

00:36:15
EDWARD HAMANN Well let me just uh, take a couple minutes here and uh, let you know how the experience was from my perspective uh, certainly Zach and Amber uh, were good clients, they were easy to work with, which is always helpful, I would say that they were both customers. They were able to articulate the issues that they wanted to work on, they had, uh, specific goals to uh, to work toward the solutions, and certainly a high level of commitment for the most part to doing that, so I think they were both customers which obviously is, is useful in the solution-focused model. Um, I hope that you noticed that I did ask the miracle question, asked some what else questions, a little bit of the exception finding question, and then certainly a number of the scaling questions which I hope you noted was useful in, in specificity I guess is the best way that I can say that making specificity of the things that they were going to commit to attempting to do differently. So I hope that you were able to see some of the techniques in solution focused therapy were displayed in this demonstration. Now I would just add that in therapy that I've done with, uh, with clients, it may be a very odd combination, but I try to blend both, uh solution focused model which I am a true believer in, with uh, oddly enough, some Bowenian (ph) family therapy. I think the need to explore what family of origin issues may be underlying is always important to do I did not go in this direction with this demonstration, out of an effort to try and be as pure about the solution focus model as I can, but I think thinking about that combination approach is something I would encourage you to do.

Emotionally Focused Therapy with Dr. Shawn Parmanand 

00:38:15
Shawn Parmanand, Ph.D. Core Faculty Member Marriage, Couple, and Family Program Walden University 

00:38:20
SHAWN PARMANAND Well hello my name is Dr. Shawn Parmanand and I am grateful for this opportunity to talk a little bit about emotion-focused therapy today. Uh, I'm currently a core faculty for Walden University in the marriage, couple, and family counseling program. So some of these theories are near and dear to my heart, and I'm glad I can, had this opportunity. Um, to give you a little brief background on emotionally focused therapy, there's really two primary figures that you have to keep in mind. The first Les Greenberg (ph) and the second is Susan Johnson (ph). So, emotionally focused theory, therapy really came out of um, watching and observing the way that couples interact. Um, Les Greenberg had training in uh, person-centered counseling, he also worked with Virginia Satyr (ph), uh, in Gestalt as well. So due to this advanced training, he saw the humanistic piece that was crucial when working with couples. In addition to that, he saw this movement in Western society where we focused a lot on behaviorism and behaviors, and how we can work with behaviors and thoughts. And after a while we started leaving out emotions, and uh, so he worked closely with Susan Johnson as they observed how important emotions were in working with the couple, and again I think that observation piece is very important, that that observation came through as well. So when we're talking about emotionally focused theory, there's really four main components, uh, that make up the theory. Uh, the first being uh, person-centered Rogerian (ph) type approach to counseling. So that would be that relationship is really important. Congruence on the part of the therapist is uh, of course important. Saying those things that we need to say as therapist is critical, as well as showing that empathy, advanced empathy, genuine-ness and unconditional positive regard for the clients that we're working with. Uh, secondly there's a Gestalt experience that goes on, so traditional Fritz prose really talks a lot about Gestalt therapy, talks a lot about awareness, and in the moment. So in emotionally focused theory, that's what we're trying to do is bring emotions to the surface, so that clients can experience it in the here and now, and then work through some of the emotions that might be going on underneath. So that's a main component as well. A third component, uh, is also uh, attachment. Which we'll Spend a little bit more time on here in a minute. Uh, I did briefly mention Virginia Satyr, and I wanna go back to that. Um, her, from that point of view, that communication piece is so critical, saying in a careful, uh, caring way to your spouse, or significant other, uh what's going on for you, that's an important piece for this too. So to do to attachment and bulbing, um, for many, they've learned about attachment in uh, undergrad and throughout their careers. Uh, but that's a basic belief that we need to attach. Uh, that's a biological innate need that we all have, from the time we're infants, is that we wanna connect to our caregiver, and how we, I think we can all understand how important it is to have that close connection with someone as we grow. Uh, but then, as we grow, that security that we need shifts from our parents, to our relationship, and that's a critical, that's a critical piece of growing and adapting in a relationship. So attachment is seen as uh, as kind of what guides emotionally-focused theory, you wanna know, how has the couple attached to one another, cause we all have that. That need. Okay, um, so then emotional availability, from our partner, is what's, what we're wanting to focus in on. When we don't' get that, we have a natural reaction to not getting that secure attachment that we all long for. So when I reach out maybe at a moment of pain and a moment of really wanting to connect and know that I'm secure with my significant other, if I don't get that that causes a natural reaction inside of me, maybe of loss of fear. A core reaction that I have, and for many of us, we don't process that core reaction, we react in a secondary way, and we'll talk a little bit about primary and secondary emotion in a moment. I wanna read a quite by Susan Johnson, because I think it does a nice job tying all this together. When one partner fails to respond at times, when the other partner's attachment needs to become urgent, these events will have a momentous and disproportional negative impact on the affective tone of the relationship, and its level of satisfaction. Conversely, when partners are able to respond at such times, this will potentiate the connection between them. So the bottom line is there's these moments of connection, of feeling attached that are critical, uh, with couples, and if in those moments, when those needs aren't met, this can do damage in a relationship that is uh, ongoing. And cyclical, and that's what you'd wanna focus in on, in emotionally focused theory. Um, so another example of that might be, let's say I'm anxiously attached to someone, and um, at those moments where maybe I'm feeling like they're gonna leave me, if I, if I don't talk about some of those inner things, like I, I'm scared of being alone, uh, I have a fear that I won't be able to make it on my own. If I don't share those things, but instead say, I feel like you're always gonna leave me, I feel like you're not there for me. I'm not sharing that core attachment need that I have, instead I'm reacting in anger, which cyclically usually does something to the other person. If I reach out to someone in anger, typically they might withdraw, or come back at me with anger, so we're having an angry fight. And this is cyclical, so next time something happens where I need to reach out, comes through as anger, the other person reacts in anger, whatever that might look like, and it's the cycle. It's the cycle that goes on that few couples really pay attention to. Uh, but that's exactly what we wanna tease out. Uh, is, is the risk from this point of view. I also wanna talk briefly about emotions. Because obviously emotionally focused theory, that's uh, a pretty big component of what we're gonna do today. Uh, I've talked briefly a little bit about emotions, uh, but I wanna, it's important I think to discern between primary and secondary emotions. So primary emotions are those emotions that we all feel, kind of on the most basic level, there's usually nothing underneath, uh, those feelings. Um, when I say nothing else, I mean other emotions. Uh, cause sometimes when we're angry, we might really be scared. We'll talk about that in a minute. Uh, but those primary emotions, happiness, sadness, grief, loneliness, shame, uh, usually those are the core emotions that we experience. Uh, we have all of use for the most part have a difficult time going to someone and sharing those core basic emotions that we have. Part of it is conditioning, part of it is society that trains us to keep things to some degree in check. To not share those vulnerable pieces of ourselves. So we kinda, kinda communicate through these patterns of keeping those primary emotions, uh, below the surface. And again, that usually bring about, uh, problems within a relationship, because we're better at sharing secondary emotions, which are more of those surface level emotions, so anger, um, there are some other examples in here, but uh, the secondary emotions are what usually couples come in wanting to talk about. So angry, or fed up, or whatever it might be, it's those, those surface level ones that people wanna talk about and they wanna avoid, um, some of the underlying emotions. I think it's important to understand and think about that um, when you do come from a more vulnerable place, in counseling, or even general in couple relationships, being vulnerable and having may have a fear of being alone, or have a feeling I have these thoughts that I'm not good enough, or I don't measure up. Usually that level of open-ness brings a certain level of disarming uh, a willingness to disarm oneself when you're in a relationship. So when you're vulnerable, people can connect uh, when you're more defensive and sharing those accusatory, uh, uh, feelings on someone else, that creates distance. So um, again, couples are creating distance, and distance, and distance instead of sharing some of those core things that will bring them together. Okay. Um, so, I wanna talk a lot, well not a lot, but a little bit about the actually stages of counseling. So we'll go through this somewhat briefly, this theory is pretty intense in terms of how structure, and also has steps that you need to follow, um, to get hopefully get the process right. Um, so I don't know for the purpose of this that we have to go through all those things, but I'll do my best to kinda give a brief synopsis. So there's three main stages with nine steps. They're kinda divided up into those stages, uh, the first stage being psycho de-escalation. It's exactly what it sounds like. So we already talked about how most couples have a cycle. Maybe one attacks, and then the other withdraws. Or one attacks, and the other attacks. So these cycles happen, and what we wanna do is we wanna get out of that cycle if we can. Um, that usually comes in step two, getting out of that cycle. Step one is really designed to assess what the cycle is. So that would involve asking questions about you know are things able to be resolved. How are things resolved in your relationship? Well, so and so goes off and slams the door, or I end up screaming, or I leave or whatever that might be, that's gonna be great clues as to the emotional focused theorist on what that cycle looks like for the couple. So it's really an assessment phase, the whole entire piece of step one. I think what's important here is that uh, the couple ends up having a pretty good perspective of what their cycle is. Because most people, this makes a lot, I mean I think to me, when I read emotionally focused theory, and I apply it, it makes a lot of sense. I mean when people hear about these cycles, they say yeah, absolutely. I have one. But unless they really spend time thinking about where that comes from, uh, there's not a lot of merit there. I don't think people give it a lot of credence. So we're spending purposeful time talking about that process and hopefully they are with that awareness, at least they know that there's something to change. We've highlighted where we need to start. So if, if therapy was to, was to be stopped after stage one, it wouldn't be sufficient. So yes, people would have an awareness like okay I realize that right now I'm withdrawing, uh, or right now I'm attacking. People are probably still going to withdraw, or still going to attack, because they haven't been taught, they haven't learned what to fill in, instead of doing those typical behaviors. Okay, so um, really the psycho de-escalation involves an assessment phase, um, talking about the interactional cycle, and we're also doing a lot of feelings. Talking a lot about feelings. We wanna get some of the feelings that people are repressing and pushing down out to the surface, so they're out, uh, and being able to be talked about. Like I said, uh, those primary emotions are rarely talked about in a relationship, and they're really disarming once you get them to the surface. So that's part of what we wanna do as well. Throughout the process there's a phenomenon from an EFT perspective called softening, where you have these hardened couples who are upset that through time they, they soften, they become more open with one another, and they learn how to dialogue and give each other what one another needs, which is a lot to do at step two. Um, so we wanna start by at least bringing those emotions into the here and now. Um, the primary techniques you might see in this first stage uh, some of the basic techniques, uh, reflecting feelings, um, validating one another's concerns. It's also important uh from the EFT perspective is you wanna what's called stop the bullet. It's um, if you do have people who attack and withdraw, we don't want them to attack in the moment, because what we're doing is we're continuing to harden that relationship. What we wanna do is jump in if we see that happening. Um, one so they don't continue to harden, two is because that gives us a great opportunity to really see the cycle. Okay, we can see people withdraw, we can see them attack. So if you see someone attacking, say what was going on for you in that moment, maybe they felt scared, whatever that might be. So that, that comes to stage one. Uh, stage two is restructuring the pattern. And I guess I should take a quick step back, uh, for me, um, hopefully today with a couple I'm seeing I'll be able to identify that pattern. I think for a first session, 30 minutes, that's about all we'll be able to do today. So um, usually EFT's about eight to 10 sessions, uh, 10 to 12, you might see as well. The next step, this is where the bulk of the work would do, is where you're really talking about that cycle. And you're identifying, uh, when I attack, this is what's going on for me, so maybe that fear of being alone, or that fear that you'll leave me one day, that's when we're starting to share a little softer things, and I think it makes sense from a counseling perspective that uh, this takes some relationship building, for people, you can't have an expectation that they'll be vulnerable, it takes time to build that relationship. Um, so you might be doing this for both partners, talking about those deeper fears, those deeper concerns that they have. And what you wanna do is have them start um, talking in those terms. So let's say someone has, a couple has a difficult time when uh, the person leaves and goes out with their friends. So maybe this person was hurt in the past, and doesn't feel like, and feels like if they go out, then maybe they're doing something they shouldn't be and they'll never come back. So, instead of being angry, and saying, you're going out again, I'm so upset, they might learn to speak, or say, share things like, when you leave with your friends, I get really scared that you'll leave me and I'll be alone, and uh, or I'm sad because I'll miss you. Whatever that might be, it's the more genuine way that they're communicating. They get used to communicating those needs and communicating those emotions, so that they can connect, um, and in that, that sort of takes the place of that cycle, uh, because they're understanding where one another's coming from. An important piece of stage two is you have to, you have to be, um, I guess cognizant of who you wanna start with, because uh, where stage one's pretty simultaneous, in terms of understanding the cycle, stage two involves a, while they're both in the room, uh, choosing one member to go through that uh, stage with, and usually that's done with a person who uh, typically withdraws, or doesn't engage. Because for this, for the person who's in a relationship with someone who disengages, that person's gonna be vulnerable that they're gonna open up, so if we place an expectation on another person that says you need to open up, you need to be the open one, and the other person withdraws, sort of the same pattern again. So uh, the therapist would typically be um, cognizant of choosing the person who's more withdrawn, more willing to escape, to get them to be more vulnerable and to see and model to the other person that this person's willing to change, uh, and hopefully through that softening, the other individual's able to be more present and connect. So really stage two is working on those things of softening of connecting. Um, uh, there's some, there's some skills in this stage as well. Um, we're talking again a lot about emotions, validating their feelings. Uh, but there's, there's three uh, main techniques in this stage that I wanted to mention. Evocative responding, heightening and interpretation. So evocative responding you use a lot of open ended questions to understand the cycle. And I'll put these in example, which I think makes it more concrete. Um, but you want people to take this, that they're sharing, like I want to escape, you wanna ask, what's it like for you to want to escape. What preceded you escaping? You want to understand what that process is for them. Uh, the next step would be heightening, and that's using metaphor, a repetition of the words that they use, to kind of heighten that emotionality. So if someone said to me they wanna escape, I might continue to say you want to escape. I wanna keep using that phrase, that the client has said, because that really heightens, that's a powerful, uh, set of words that people have combined together and we wanna know what emotion's behind that. The last piece is interpretation, and that's something that counselor might use as well where you're interpreting what it's like for them to wanna escape. That they're so scared to connect, or they don't wanna be left alone. You're interpreting for them what might be going on, when they're, they have that impetus to wanna escape so badly. So um, I'll give you an example, if something that I was to say to someone who shared they'd been feeling sick in their relationship. So you felt sick? Nauseated, as you put it, you said to yourself, I am invisible to him. He isn't there for me. Is that it? It was like you didn't matter him, and that moved you into I must protect myself, I must shut down, I must not let myself need. Is that it? So that brief paragraph is an example of evocative responding, so asking a lot of questions, and then heightening, and you can see the powerful phrases used in there. And then the last piece is interpretation, now, um, uh, that you, you weren't needed the way that you'd like to, and then obviously the last question is that it, because we're trying to understand that that's the cycle for them. Uh, the last stage involves similar techniques, um, but the last stage really is putting everything back together. So you've identified a cycle, you've hopefully changed the cycle a little bit, uh, at least so they're asking for what they need in the relationship. That softening's occurred. So then what you're able to do from this point on is work on some of those concerns that the couple has had that they probably came in with. But, what's great is that you work through the cycle, it gets in the way of working through problems, so people aren't withdrawing, people aren't attacking, they're being able to calmly ask for what they need and connect in the moment. Some of those underlying issues that maybe have gone on for years and years sort of cause hardening, can actually be talked through and worked through by the clients. In addition you wanna remind the clients how far they've come. Uh, and I think that's an important piece as well. So uh, this last cycle called, uh, um, consolidation, it's kinda putting it all back together after you've disassembled the cycle. Putting it all together and hopefully they can act in that manner as the clients move forward. So, overall that's a really brief, uh, conceptual idea of what EFT looks like and very complex theory. Uh, it's one that's well researched, well documented, one of the best uh, and most empirically validated couple theories that's available. And so I encourage you to look more into it if you're interested. All right, Zach and Amber, it's a pleasure to have you two here today, I'm looking forward to speaking with you today. Um, so, I'll be using briefly, and I don't know how much it really matters, but we're gonna be talking a little bit about how you two interact with one another. And I think that's where I'd like to start. But first, I was hoping you'd talk to me a little bit about how you two met.

AMBER Sure. Um, well we've been married for five years, um, we met in college, uh, we both worked at the college radio station together, so- 

00:57:00
ZACH Music is a common interest. 

00:57:05
SHAWN PARMANAND Okay, so that's something that connects you two. 

00:57:05
AMBER Yes, definitely, that's kinda what first sparked our relationship together. And so just kinda went from there. 

00:57:15
SHAWN PARMANAND Okay, all right, so what, you talked briefly about it, but I'm, I'm curious if you can add on, I wanna hear from you, uh, Zach, is what, what attracted you two to one another aside from music. 

00:57:25
ZACH She's funny. I mean she's hilarious, and I mean the thing about it is, she doesn't try to do it intentionally. It's just herself. She's just very funny, she's smart, um, and you know we're hanging out at the radio station, you know, and that's a common interest, and I've never found someone that could keep up with me musically, like with the things I like, you know like she knows about years, records were made, and who produced them and you know we, all our bands, the same type of stuff, we kinda like, except for country, we don't do that. But- 

00:58:00
AMBER I'll dabble, but there's a strict rule at our house. 

00:58:00
ZACH I can't mess with that. But that, we have that, and you know I'm a big sports guy and she sometimes, you know is interested in sports as well, but the whole music thing, and just having someone I can talk to and be myself, like I can be myself around her, I can be silly, you know, I can have a good sense of humor, she's got a good sense of humor. You know she's, not the most coordinated, there's been times when she's walked and just fell. Things like that where she's not trying to be, funny, but it's just her, she's just a good person, we get along together, and just that first time meeting her, I know I, I knew when I met her that I was like okay, she's kinda cool, I might have to talk to her, so. She's really cool, I couldn't let her think she was kinda cool, I actually thought she was really cool. Surprised I actually ended up with her, so, you know. 

00:58:50
SHAWN PARMANAND All right, so you feel like you, you've done well. 

00:58:50
ZACH I will keep my coverage you know, I lucked out on this one. Definitely. 

00:59:00
SHAWN PARMANAND Very good, well Zach, I heard as you were speaking there, and it's interesting is you're sharing that I kinda saw her light up, but you talked about a sense of humor, being able to be yourself. And also connecting on things that mattered to you, music and otherwise, and having that connection. How about for you? 

00:59:15
AMBER Uh, very much the same thing, I mean, he is just a wonderful person, big, big heart, very smart, uh, much smarter than me, but he doesn't over shadow me or try seem like he is, but he's just a wonderful all around guy, fun, fun to be with, and he is who he is, and I love that about him. So, and that's something that's always drawn me to him is his personality, his care-free attitude, and just his love of life in general, so. He's just a wonderful person. 

00:59:45
SHAWN PARMANAND Okay, very good. Well it seemed like, seemed like it did matter to hear that from her. I imagine it's kind of nice, how often do you talk about those things that, that attracted you- 

01:00:00
AMBER Not really, I mean it's, it's nice to hear those things and kind of have that exchange, I mean I like got colored red, but it's really sweet, so. 

01:00:10
SHAWN PARMANAND Well very good, well why don't we fast forward a little bit and talk to me what brings you in here today. 

01:00:15
AMBER Well, today, uh, well- 

01:00:15
ZACH We're not in college anymore. 

01:00:20
AMBER Well things have, life has happened, I mean since those wonderful feelings, I mean we still feel this way, that way, about each other, it's just um, our jobs have kind of gotten in the way, and uh, I have my own business I recently started, and it's, not going so well, very stressful for me, I know his work is very stressful for him. Having a hard time right now in our relationship separating work and life. Um, I also have a 10 year old son, from a previous relationship, and he means the word to me and so does he. The two of them just can't quite get it together, and it's hard for me to see this, it's heart breaking, and I kind of at my breaking point, as to I don't know what to do. For you two. 

01:01:00
SHAWN PARMANAND All right, so to, sort of make sure I'm understanding. Uh, work stress for both of you. Uh, is going on, and there's this relationship where it sounds like you're choosing, on a day to day basis, do I choose my son? Or do I choose my-, okay, okay- 

01:01:15
AMBER Yes, very much so, I feel like monkey in the middle. It's always very difficult. 

01:01:20
SHAWN PARMANAND All right, and is that, Zach is that stress similar for you, I mean she, she's kind of said there's stress on your end, can you talk to me a little bit about that stress? 

01:01:30
ZACH Well I'm into law, and I'm trying to be a partner at my firm, which means long hours. I'm not at home as much as I would like to be. Um, there are times when I'll stay overnight at the office, which is probably not the healthiest thing for a marriage. And, but her son, uh, Rufus, cool guy, 10 years old, fiercely independent just like his mom, but uh, him and I butt heads a lot, because I think he's trying to see me coming and trying to, you know tell him what to do. You know like, cause I'm not his dad, but I'm, you know adult in the household, and it can make things a little tough on that end for, you know I might suggest something to him he not be with that at all, and you know after multiple times of this happening, I might show my frustration which, well I might, I will show my frustration, which upsets him and in turn upsets his mom, since he's upset- 

01:02:30
SHAWN PARMANAND So it's a cycle, you're saying. 

01:02:30
ZACH Yeah, you know, and it probably would be better, no probably, it would be better if I was at home more, but I'm trying to become a partner at this firm. 

01:02:40
SHAWN PARMANAND So you're stuck too, do I choose family, be at home, I know that would be helpful, but then my job suffers, which is really important. 

01:02:45
ZACH Right, and the, with the position, with the promotion this job, it'd make things better for us, but I gotta get there, and by me getting there, I'm not spending as much time at home. 

01:03:00
SHAWN PARMANAND Sure, okay, okay. So I mean, how, how in the past have you resolved this? 

01:03:05
AMBER Uh, it's usually uh, we disagree to disagree, or agree to disagree and kinda just go about our day- 

01:03:10
ZACH Leave it as is- 

01:03:10
AMBER Resentment and anger and he storms out, I'm yelling, and then I'm trying to be there with my son and man the household, and I know he's not stressed at work, but at the same time you know you have a family too, and it's very hard and we want him to be a part of our lives, at least I really want that to be happening, and I feel like he's in another world. Um, in a world that I don't know anything about, and that I'm not a part of. 

01:03:40
SHAWN PARMANAND Sure, sure. Okay, well I, I admire your willingness and your effort you both are take care of Rufus, I think today, for the, the purpose of what we're gonna be talking about, is we're gonna, we're gonna work on you today, with the belief that if we can get you to connect in a way that you're both wanting and asking for, uh, that hopefully things with Rufus will get better as well, if we can unite this parental front. So um, when you were talking usually we go our separate ways, uh, to me it sounds like, and correct me if I'm wrong, withdrawing, you withdraw from one another. So is that proximally, like you literally leave? 

01:04:15
AMBER That, I would agree with that, yeah. I mean, I mean it gets heated, and it's not like, you know knock-down drag-out, but not to like, I don't wanna see you and he just leaves, I mean he goes to work, and he has a place to go and I'm still at home, and it's just frustrating, so- 

01:04:30
SHAWN PARMANAND Okay, all right. So what I hear you saying is I have this desire to be a good parent, I'm trying to be successful as a business owner, I need, I need my husband, uh, to be therefore me, uh, but there's so much stress that we end up going separate ways. That thing we need the most is pushed away, uh, because you're unable to resolve. 

01:04:50
AMBER To-, totally, yeah. 

01:04:55
SHAWN PARMANAND And same for you, you wanna connect with Rufus, but you also feel so obligated to your job, to be successful, and I imagine that's an effort to take care of your family, that you have. 

01:05:00
ZACH Absolutely, and my trying, reaching out to Rufus is not as good as where it needs to be. I've made, token efforts I think you'd say, but I haven't really made a concrete, concerted, okay this is what's going to happen. You and I, we're going to figure out something. You know I, here or there, hit or miss, and I don't blame him for blowing me off. You know I mean, what other 10 year old kid would be like he can-, kids are smart, he can see right through it, you know, and by doing that, that makes him upset, because it feels like I'm insulting him. And, which in turn makes her upset, and when we're both upset, you know, I'll stay at work, or I'll just go to work and say, you know what, I'm gonna work on something, or be productive at work. Instead of, you know, having everybody upset and get out of there, and you know blow off some steam, finally release. You know decompress a little bit. And maybe hopefully we'll try it again and try to make thing better. 

01:06:00
SHAWN PARMANAND Well and, and it sounds like it means a lot to you, that relationship, and really what I'm getting a sense is, and you can again correct me if I'm wrong, but there's, there's fear for both of you. Fear that um, maybe you're not connecting in the way that you would like to with Rufus, but also a fear that, maybe I won't be successful in my job, maybe I won't be successful in my job and that fear is, uh, creating a separation for you. 

01:06:20
AMBER I'd say that, that that's true. Yeah. 

01:06:25
ZACH Well, and I'm not as home as much as I would like to be. And I'm at work because I'm trying to reach this goal, it's making me seem very narrowly focused and self-centered because I'm working on this job, but you know to be a partner at a firm doesn't come around every day. And I don't wanna use that as an excuse, but if I can achieve this, it's important, if I can achieve this then we'll be set. But I gotta get there. 

01:06:45
AMBER And I understand that he's doing it for the family, I mean I get that, uh, my son on the other hand, a 10 year old, doesn't really get that, I mean all he sees is a dad that, who's real dad is not around, and now his step dad is not around anymore either- 

01:07:05
ZACH As much as need be. So. 

01:07:05
SHAWN PARMANAND Can you talk to me briefly about what you do when you're really scared? 

01:07:15
AMBER When I'm really scared, like as far as in our relationship? 

01:07:20
SHAWN PARMANAND Yeah, when you're not getting what you need, and you're feeling scared, how does that come out? How would I see that? 

01:07:25
AMBER Uh, I'm not somebody who likes confrontation, I usually try to avoid that, but instead I end up bottling that up and usually it'll come out in feeling hurt, um, I usually call my mom, or my sister, you know, or best friend, that kind of stuff and just vent. You know, and that seems to help. But, you know it can, calms me down a little, but then when it comes time to actually discuss this with him, I just get so, ooh, like it just isn't come out, it just comes out very angry. 

01:07:55
SHAWN PARMANAND Sure, sure. So you're feeling scared, you're worried about the relationship. You're worried about your business. And to me I see those connected, it's fear, it's fear that you're not going to be able to do what you want to do with your life. So you're feeling this high level of fear, you're not getting what you need, so you withdraw, and go to other people for support, and then those times where you choose not to withdraw and actually try to connect, it comes out as kinda bottled up, anger, I'm getting all out, sometimes you'd call it collecting criticisms, where it's built up over a while, um, and so that's, that's placed upon you, I'm assuming, please correct me if I'm wrong. 

01:08:30
AMBER Yeah, it's, it's very much placed upon him, I mean I know, you know with my son, I usually don't, I don't want to involve him in any of that, I mean he's dealt with enough, so it, it's always towards him. 

01:08:45
SHAWN PARMANAND Okay, all right, so you've got, so you've got your wife, you've got this busy job, um, and I hope you don't feel like I'm taking sides, I'm just trying to understand. So you're going through all this, all this, you have fear in your own right, and then your wife comes to you in this way of collecting criticisms, you're not getting along with Rufus, uh, you're not around as much, what's your natural inclination, how do you wanna behave when you hear those things, what would I see? 

01:09:05
ZACH Well I don't blame her. I mean I can understand her aspect of it. You know, um, my thing is, is I shut down when she hates. You know, I am, because I don't wanna say something you know that I would regret, even though I should probably speak or, um, I don't wanna make her more upset, which in turn me shutting down does, and I'm not trying to, but that's what happens, you know, so, I want to just, I sit there I listen to her, and I'll say okay, and, then I don't wanna talk, she'll want me to talk to her, and then I don't want to. You know I don't' want to talk. She gets nothing, and then she gets really upset about that, you know so, cause I'm not one to blow up, you know, but I don't, I'm trying to not make the situation worse, which in turn makes it worse, and that makes sense, so, you know. 

01:09:55
SHAWN PARMANAND It absolutely does. So you're both in this high level of fear, which is sounds like isn't talked about as much, but that comes out for you a little bit like anger, possibly attacking, and again correct me if I'm wrong, which turn for you when you're feeling attacked, you just, you said I just go, I withdraw, I just get out of there. As quickly as I can. 

01:10:15
ZACH Find some headphones, and, you know listen to some music. She does not like that. 

01:10:20
SHAWN PARMANAND Okay, which in turn build up your anger, um, so it kind of escalates. 

01:10:25
AMBER Yes, yes. It fuels the fire. 

01:10:25
SHAWN PARMANAND Okay, and this is a cycle that you both kinda recognize, in your relationship. 

01:10:30
ZACH Absolutely, yeah. 

01:10:30
SHAWN PARMANAND Okay, okay, so in those moments, and maybe you could, you could even turn to him and talk to him a little bit, in those moment when you're feeling that high level of fear, and you're coming at it from a place of anger, if I could take that anger away and say you're not allowed to talk about that, but what you're allowed to do is talk about that fear. Could you share with him some of the fear that you have going on in your relationship? 

01:10:55
AMBER Sure, right now? 

01:10:55
SHAWN PARMANAND Yeah, that'd be great. 

01:10:55
AMBER Well, I guess, I, I fear that you don't wanna be there for me and my son. I fear that deep down, you're happier at work than you are at home, and I fear that ultimately, you're gonna leave us, and I don't want that, and my son doesn't want that, I know it's hard for him to show that to you, that's genuinely what I fear, is you leaving. Because we love you very much. And that it would break my heart. 

01:11:25
SHAWN PARMANAND Okay, thank you for sharing that, so um, what you're saying is, I'm afraid to be alone. I'm afraid what life would be like if I didn't have your support. 

01:11:35
AMBER Yes. 

01:11:35
SHAWN PARMANAND Yes. So, maybe you can walk me through what that was like to hear those words, um, or maybe you can, maybe it would be more important for you to tell her. 

01:11:45
ZACH Well, that was, that was nice. I, I didn't know that you had that deep of fear, because I've mentioned before, you're fiercely independent. You know, so, you know that was, that was a fear that I wasn't certain would you would have. Because um, you're very independent and you like to do your own thing, but at the same time, I didn't know you had that internally, you know, so, that was good to hear. That was good to hear, and, that's something that we can work with. 

01:12:15
SHAWN PARMANAND Okay, so probably something you'd wanna take your headphones out to hear, right? 

01:12:20
ZACH I probably should not have my headphones in. Yeah, she's a better person than that, you know so, I won't, I probably should not have the Beatz by Dre headphones and you know, bumping something. 

01:12:30
SHAWN PARMANAND Mm-hm, okay, so I think it's important to do, for both of you to see this both ways. That she was kinda coming from a place of I'm afraid to be alone. I'm curious what it's like for you, when you're busy at work, you have a million things going, you're also really worried about your capabilities as, I don't know, I don't wanna say capabilities, but your relationship with Rufus. You're also worried about her relationship, I'm wondering when you feel attacked, you have all this stress going on, what's going on internally for you? And what's your sort of core fear, uh, that's going on, um, in that moment where you wanna withdraw and get away. 

01:13:00
ZACH Core fear, that's a good question. Um, I would think that my greatest fear would be them finally saying, I've had it. You know, I'm done, I mean, where I'm at work, and trying to reach this goal, which I told her might take some time, and then it just for me not being around, her finally saying, you know what, thanks but no thanks. See ya later. And that would suck, so I wouldn't want that to happen. That's probably internally, fear, if I had to really think about something, and really scared that they both would just, as she mentioned earlier, they would just both be like, you know what, you keep telling me it's gonna get better, but I just can't see it. I gotta go. 

01:13:45
SHAWN PARMANAND Okay, so when you think about them leaving, and saying, I can't deal with it anymore, this is it, that's really that sense of fear, sounds like it overcomes you, that you wanna escape from, uh, when she's, when she's approaching you about an issue. Okay, all right, I'm wondering if you could maybe summarize it out, and tell her, instead of me. 

01:14:10
ZACH I don't know man. 

01:14:10
SHAWN PARMANAND If you put it concisely, maybe a sentence or two, when you attack me, or, I know that's a strong word, when you're angry with me, um, I have these fears running through my head. And I feel scared, if you could just share that with her. 

01:14:25
ZACH Know, well one being concise is not my strong suit, so just try and do that. Just try and do that. Um, I know I work all the time, and I know that I'm not at home nearly as much as you would like for me to be, and withdrawing, I withdraw because I don't want to say something that's going to permanently damage our relationship, so you know I'm sorry for withdrawing, and running off to work when you would like to talk to me, cause it kinda seems like I don't care about you, ignoring how you feel, and how you feel is important, so I apologize for that. And hopefully, I can make strides in the right direction to change that, and that's, so me so stubborn as a mule, so that we can, you know, fix what we have. 

01:15:20
SHAWN PARMANAND I don't mean to cut you out there, can you look at her and share that core fear that you have, of her leaving you? 

01:15:25
ZACH Well, like my fear, you know my fear is that eventually, cause I keep telling you it's gonna get better, but it's really not, my eventual fear is going to be, you and Rufus will say, all right man, well, you know what, here it is, two years later, keep telling me it's going to be better, we're still fighting, you're off to work, see ya later. And that's, I think a legitimate concern to have. 

01:15:55
SHAWN PARMANAND So that's what scares you the most. Is her leaving you. So, I wanna know what that's like for you to hear, and I'm curious if this is typical of Zach, or if this is- 

01:16:05
AMBER This is, this is, not typical, I mean- 

01:16:05
ZACH Atypical. 

01:16:05
AMBER Well he expressed that, I mean it's hard to hear, and it does, I'm very sad that he feels that way, and I don't want him to feel that way, I mean my immediate reaction is just hug him and tell him we're not gonna leave you, obviously I want to work this out, I mean, we're not gonna leave, we don't wanna leave him, and it's hard, it's hard to hear that. 

01:16:30
SHAWN PARMANAND Okay, you mentioned there that, I wanna hug him, I'm not gonna leave, if I gave you permission to do that, would you be willing to give him a hug and say you wouldn't? 

01:16:35
AMBER I'm not gonna leave. 

01:16:40
ZACH Okay, good, that's good to know, thank you babe. 

01:16:45
SHAWN PARMANAND All right, so I'm curious, uh, how often this sort of exchange happens in your, in your relationship. 

01:16:50
ZACH Rare- 

01:16:55
AMBER Yeah, very rare. I mean we're just in two totally different worlds, and just kinda spinning out of control most of the time. Not a lot of closeness. 

01:17:00
SHAWN PARMANAND Okay, so what, specifically helped you feel more close to him, today? 

01:17:05
AMBER Today? I just, the fact that we actually spoke to each other, I mean that definitely helps, I mean that doesn't happen often. A lot of times it's filled with eye rolling, headphones, and just one or the other person having enough and leaving. 

01:17:25
ZACH Loud words. Loud words, and, yeah. 

01:17:30
SHAWN PARMANAND Okay, all right. So how about for you what was different today about this conversation? 

01:17:35
ZACH I think I have a clearer understanding of what needs to happen so that some positive things can surface. You know I, a better understanding of what she would like from me, what I, what I don't need to do, or I need not do in order for our relationship to become stronger and grow and you know, us lead a type of life that we would like to have, so I, you know she clearly stated today, you know, this, this, this. And we can work on those things, there's nothing that's un-, there's nothing unattainable. 

01:18:10
SHAWN PARMANAND Sure and it's-, it sounds, it's interesting to me, both are coming from a really similar place, right? I'm afraid, I'm afraid to be alone, I'm afraid I'll be left, I'm afraid I'll have to fend for myself. So it's a really similar point that, at the core, is sort of what's connecting you two, but in fact it's pushing you two apart. In your relationship. Okay, um, I think the big piece, and it's turned out to be exactly as you were talking about, is um, when I ask her to do certain things. And, what I have appreciated about both you today is talking a little bit about what you need in a relationship. I think that's a different way to communicate. Because usually when we're in a relationship we're telling people what they're doing wrong, or what they need to do, and I think today you both talked about I have this fear, I have this fear, and the only that satiates is fear, is this from you, and I think that's important to document. Okay, so, we'll move towards wrapping up, what we would do in the future sessions is talk a little bit more about this cycle that we're seeing and how we can learn to talk to each other a little differently to get what we need in those moments, because sometimes when it builds up, like we talked about, I imagine it builds up for you too, with all the stress at work and stress in the relationship, uh, that when it's built up, it's usually when you've fallen into that cycle, of putting in your headphones, or going the other way, or blowing up. Or whatever that might look like. So hopefully, as we continue to talk, we'd find a way to bring you guys to not get to that point, and we'll talk about things in clearer and emotional way. So it's been a pleasure, thank you for coming in today. 

01:19:40
AMBER Thank you. 

01:19:40
ZACH Thanks for having us. 

01:19:45
SHAWN PARMANAND All right, well that, that I thought was a nice example of emotionally focused therapy. I thought what went particularly well is that the, I think the couple left here with an idea of what their pattern would be, uh, so, I mean as you saw, um, she typically when needing to reach out to her significant other had a tendency to uh, withdraw go to other people, and then when she did engage, coming from a place of anger and, upset which cyclically ended up having her significant other wanting to withdraw through putting on the headphones and getting away. So I thought uh, what was helpful is that they realized that, and that would of been my goal for session one. Um, I think what I would have liked to have done, and you know this is my hope, I think we'll have to do a little more work, if I was to see this couple, is they weren't as vulnerable as I would like them to be, so what I try to do is a lot of feelings. So uh, I think there's a clear difference between talking about feelings and feeling feelings. And from an emotionally focused therapy point of view, we want them feeling feelings, because like I talked about, that's the most disarming place you can be. So for this session, I thought they did a nice job identifying the cycle, but I think it would be even more helpful to get them in a place of vulnerability, of emotion, so they can really connect on that emotional level, rather than just talking about being afraid. I'd want to see them afraid, I'd want to see them, um, sad, in the moment. So some of the ways I might come through is you know maybe if I can see some sort of behavior that indicates that they're sad in that moment, I'd wanna highlight that. I thought I could use some more feeling reflections to even bring emotion more into the moment, I felt like the first probably five minutes I wasn't, I wasn't as cognizant as I should've been in bringing emotion to the room, and that's something I definitely wanted to do from the get go. So again I have an idea of a cycle, which is wonderful. If I were seeing them next week, I'd wanna immediately talk about how they've seen the cycle manifest in their lives, if they've seen an example of it. I think having a real life perspective on the cycle that we identify can help them attach some in-the-moment feelings to it. And then I'd wanna process again through some of those feelings. Uh, through the next few sessions. So I'd really highlight, I think again I'd want them to be more vulnerable, I want them to talk more about that fear of being alone, or being left. Uh, and that's where I'd wanna head if I continue to work if I continued to work for this, with this couple.

Logo Therapy with Dr. Holly Nikels 

01:22:10
Holly Nikels Associate Professor Department of Counselor Education Western Illinois University 

01:22:15
HOLLY NIKEL Hi, I'm Dr. Holly Nikels. I am going to demonstrate today some of some logo therapy, and logo therapy is the what could be considered to be the practice of existential therapy, existential counseling. The idea of, uh, logo therapy derives from the work of Dr. Victor Frankl, Dr. Frankl was imprisoned in three different concentration camps, uh, in Nazi Germany, during World War II, and what happened during that time for him is that he noticed how folks around him, how other prisoners around him responded to their situation, and began to make observations about that. Logo is the Greek word for meaning. And so logo therapy is in fact then, meaning-centered therapy. How do we make meaning of our lives, how do we make sense of what's happening around us, and how that impacts our actions and our view of the world. So in working with the couple today, we'll be looking at their particular situation, and I'll be working with them a little bit about the meaning they make from their situation. With logo therapy, um, the theory believes that there are three aspects to a human being. There's the mind, body, and the spirit. And that all of those things interact with each other and that you can interact and make changes in those, any of those dimensions and it will impact sort of the whole. So it's a very holistic approach, uh, to counseling, it's a very spiritual approach. The idea that makes logo therapy a little different than other counseling is the idea that life provides us with opportunities to create meaning. Not that we create meaning, but that life provides them and then we take advantage of those opportunities, so it's a little bit different than how're you gonna change this, how're you gonna change your life. It's more about how're you going to change your perspective on your life. So, uh, it's, it's a very interesting way of looking at situations, and I think it's, uh, it's a very optimistic approach to working with problems. It really is looking more at opportunities for growth than it is, uh, problem saturated, so I hopefully will be able to see some of that today with our, with our couple as they come in, and look at the situation that they're dealing with. Okay, Amber, Zach, thank you so much for coming in today. Can you give me a little bit of information about yourselves and what brings you into counseling today? What, what it is that's happening with you? 

01:24:55
AMBER Sure, um, well we've been married for five years, um, we've been together, gosh like eight years now. We met in college, and lately it kind of seems like the reasons that we fell in love with each other are still there, we very much love each other, but we kind of life happened in between. Um. 

01:25:10
ZACH Stuff's harder now. 

01:25:15
AMBER Yes. 

01:25:15
HOLLY NIKEL Than it was in college? 

01:25:15
ZACH Yes, and just anything with life, you know we didn't have a job then, we just had to worry about school, now we have a job, she has a son. 

01:25:25
AMBER I do, I have a son, from a previous relationship. A 10 year old son, um. 

01:25:30
HOLLY NIKEL So he, your son was part of this deal from the get go, but as kids get older and, and so all that evolved. 

01:25:35
ZACH We had to become adults. 

01:25:35
HOLLY NIKEL Bit of a downer- 

01:25:40
AMBER It is! 

01:25:40
ZACH It's not college! 

01:25:45
HOLLY NIKEL No it's not. 

01:25:45
AMBER But it just, uh, our relationship is, is just become very strenuous. With work, very stressful, both of our work situations, I own my own company, it's not going so well. Uh, it's been very difficult, and then with my son, the bonding thing, he's 10, and it's becoming uh, very hard headed, very difficult. And he doesn't has very much of a relationship with his father. He lives far away, we've tried, it hasn't worked out so well, and I think that with his work situation, he's constantly crying, constantly working, there's no separation between work and life anymore. There's no home life, we don't see him much, and it's affecting me and I see it affecting my son as well. I'm seeing his step dad not being around, and feeling the same feelings of, of abandonment and, and leaving, so I-, I-, there's a lot of resentment there. And it's very hard for me to watch and be sort of the monkey in the middle between the two. 

01:26:50
HOLLY NIKEL So you see the resentment as being between your son and Zach, not necessarily that you are resentful, but you're feeling like you're trapped in the middle of these- 

01:27:00
AMBER Yes, I want them to be cohesive and to get there and function as a family, because I know that there's love there, it's just that right now it seems to be this very difficult time, um, and especially I said, just getting into his teen years, and going through, a whole mess of hormones and angsty feelings. So right there, yes, it's becoming a struggle, and I mean he's understanding more and more now that he's older of what has happened and what is going on between the two of us, so I really want us to get back to a good place. 

01:27:45
HOLLY NIKEL Okay, so Zach as you hear Amber talk about that, is that how you see the situation? Or is that how you understand Amber to see that, or what's your perspective on what's going on? 

01:27:55
ZACH I mean she's right, um, no, she's-, she's, she's right, I mean, what she said, I mean I'm gonna, I'm going to elaborate on that, but she's, yeah, she um, she's right, I am at work all the time. I'm a lawyer, and I'm trying to become a partner in a firm, my firm, and I'm kinda young, but still I've worked hard to even have this opportunity. Long hours, at the office. Long days, long hours. Which in turn affects the stuff that we got going on at home. And she's been crazy patient with me, I've told her, it might be very time consu-, time consuming, I might not be at home as much as you would like for me to be and this in turn has stressed her out because I know she's struggling with her boutique, and I'm not seeing Rufus as much as a step dad should. And, I hate using the word should, but still, I'm not using, I'm not being there as much as he would need for me to be or as I, much as I would like for myself to be. Uh, it's just, it's difficult because I'm not dad. And he knows that. You know, and I don't wanna portray myself as not saying I care about him, I do care about him, but he sees me as you know, someone, as an authority figure, why are you telling me what to do, you're not my dad. And I really can't argue with that because I'm not his dad, even though I'm the adult in the household, and I try to communicate that, sometimes he's not trying to hear it. And then with that, I'm getting frustrated because I'm making-, trying to make it a small effort, not a great effort, I'll be honest about that, try and make a small effort, and you know we're both butting heads. And he is fiercely uh, defensive over his mom, and he should be, I'm not saying he isn't, but you know any time she and I might have any conflict he immediately steps up to me as like, you know, dude, this is my mom, back up. And I-, I can respect that, but you know we have things we're trying to work out and then I put him into the mix as well trying to work things out with him and I think there's some common areas that we can along with, but with me being at work and then trying to come home and see him, I think he's just trying to see, he sees me as trying to a token effort, to you know be his friend, or whatnot, and he's not dealing, he's not handling that, he's not liking that. Or as he would say he's not feeling that. Not feeling that at all. No he's not. 

01:30:30
HOLLY NIKEL Okay, okay, so I have a quick question, just, all these things running through my head. But- 

01:30:35
ZACH I know, I said a whole lot, sorry. Yeah, I said a lot. 

01:30:40
HOLLY NIKEL You're, it's all good. What happens when Rufus and Amber argue? 

01:30:45
ZACH When those two argue? 

01:30:45
HOLLY NIKEL Yeah, well you said that- 

01:30:45
ZACH I don't necessarily, they really, they have a good relationship. 

01:30:50
HOLLY NIKEL Okay, so there's not a lot of conflict. 

01:30:50
AMBER There's not a lot of conflict. 

01:30:50
ZACH I don't wanna say he's a momma's boy, I am too, that's not exactly, I am but, he, he loves his mom, as well as he should, you know they don't really get into a lot of things, and she lets him know, and she can speak to him that way, you know, she lets him know it's like hey, this is how it's going to be. 

01:31:10
AMBER He's just had a hard time taking it from him. 

01:31:10
ZACH You know, but with me in the mix, he looks at me like. Come on now. You know. 

01:31:15
AMBER I've tried to discuss this with him, and you know the, oh, well, kind of roll his eyes, doesn't, I mean he's just at that age when he doesn't really wanna hear it from anybody, so I don't know, I just, I wish that they could find some sort of common ground, I mean I-, and I've tried to bring them together, just doesn't ever. 

01:31:35
ZACH And I'm not at home all the time because of work, so that doesn't help things. At all. 

01:31:40
HOLLY NIKEL So you're, not only is your family very important to you, which I'm hearing you say, that this is an important family, for both of you, but also then your work, both of your work is very important. Gives you some, uh, meaning in your lives, something that you, that you really hold on to, identifies who you are, but trying to meld that with this family is a little different for you, so it's a new pattern. I mean it's not, I'm guessing, neither of you had this pattern growing up, that you had, your step, did your step parents, or- 

01:32:10
ZACH I didn't. No. Yeah, my family, they're successful people, um, my grandfather was a lawyer, dad's a lawyer, his family business type thing, brother-, my brother is a lawyer, so I mean we all, you know, we all went to the same, yeah, so I mean it's just, I, we were the, we had family together, there was no blended family, it was my mom and dad still together, you know, they have issues of course, but they're still together. 

01:32:40
HOLLY NIKEL Because they're married, that's what happens. 

01:32:45
ZACH Right, you're right, but you know they're together a long time, happy, and you know it's me and my brother and I, we see them and their example they set, and you know um- 

01:32:50
HOLLY NIKEL Did you work with their family, or are they part of the firm that your- 

01:32:55
ZACH No, no, no, no, we're, they're in different locations. But, they know what I'm going through, because my dad, successful, granddad, successful, and you know to attain this position at this age would be a big deal. You know, it'd be a good thing, to have, and you know my family's supportive of my decision. They, like, Amber, big fan of Amber, um, well, you know. Big fan of her, and you know um, they're never rude or anything to Rufus, but it's kind of an uncomfortable situation, because you know, step son, bringing him home, they've been nice and cordial- 

01:33:35
AMBER They're very traditional. 

01:33:35
ZACH Yes, so, you know, with my choice of marrying Amber, you know my mom hopes to be a grandma someday, even though she is a step-grandma, but-, yeah, you know she, she feels like that. 

01:33:45
HOLLY NIKEL So a piece of it then is figuring out how this fits together. Into that, idea of family, and how do we all fit together and how we working as a family. The reason I asked about what would happen if Rufus, Amber argue is because I heard you say that he defends his mom. So I wonder- 

01:34:00
ZACH When I speak to him, yeah- 

01:34:05
HOLLY NIKEL So I wondered if they argued, if then you found yourself if you and Rufus were switched, and now- 

01:34:10
ZACH There's nothing really for me to defend, because he, he listens, you know when she speaks, it's like, he's like, okay mom. 

01:34:15
HOLLY NIKEL Sounds like a good kid. 

01:34:15
AMBER He is, he really is, I mean- 

01:34:15
ZACH He's a good kid, we just don't get along as well as we probably should. 

01:34:20
AMBER Yeah, he's a good kid, just not causing problem, great student, you know he's respectful it just, he has issues. It all comes from- 

01:34:25
ZACH Once again, like his mom, fiercely independent. Like he doesn't want help with anything. You know he's just independent. His own mind. 

01:34:35
AMBER Yeah and, with him coming from more of a traditional family, I mean and our parental skills are a little different in the way that we kind of have run things in the household. We differ on things, he tends to be a little bit more strict with things, and I've always just come from a family that's a little bit more free spirited, he always makes fun and laughs at it, I mean, it- 

01:35:00
ZACH They're like hippies. 

01:35:00
HOLLY NIKEL Okay, no I got it. 

01:35:00
AMBER So yeah, a little more free will, free spirited kind of thing. And I know in my heart that my son will make the correct decisions for him and I want him to be able to do those things. 

01:35:10
HOLLY NIKEL So you sort of let that unfold. 

01:35:10
AMBER Yeah, and he has always, but it seems lately just has been something I think, and then I can tell in him, is bubbling inside of him and then when he comes home and we haven't seen him and there's no interaction, he's like well who's this guy? You know I think he feels this is me and my mom, who are you, you know? Even though he's been a part of our lives for years, it still is kind of like well I, get this way at home, and then all of a sudden here you are. So. 

01:35:45
HOLLY NIKEL Saying I can't or I don't- 

01:35:45
AMBER Exactly, yeah, and then, and then it puts me in an awkward position to where you know I wanna be able to back him, but then I don't want to go against my son or in his trust and, and causing more issues for him. 

01:35:55
HOLLY NIKEL Okay, and then that causes conflict between the two of you. 

01:35:55
AMBER Yes. 

01:35:55
HOLLY NIKEL Okay, all right. Okay, so many, so many things. 

01:36:00
ZACH We got some stuff. 

01:36:05
HOLLY NIKEL Yeah, not that none of it can't be looked at and managed and dealt with and given perspective on and all of those sorts of things. I mean it sounds like you both want the same things, which is a family, you want, and you want the three of you to be a family, and whatever means that's just gonna look different for your family, then well every family is different, every family has its own culture, every family has its own dynamics. Cause I'm thinking, as your talking, I'm thinking not only are there two different parenting styles, there's a guy someplace else who sometimes probably chimes in a little bit as well. 

01:36:45
AMBER Right he's not, pretty active, I've tried in the past, lives far away, is an occasional blip on the radar, which is also very hard. 

01:36:50
HOLLY NIKEL Yeah, well, cause you don't know when it's coming, it can upset your, cause the balance that you're working to find. 

01:36:55
AMBER Exactly, exactly, and it, mean, he doesn't have much to say as far as authoritative, or any decision-making really, but I mean he does show up and, I mean he is a factor. Obviously, so. 

01:37:10
HOLLY NIKEL Absolutely, and he always will be. But the idea would be that, the three of you to be a strong unit, a nice strong unit and then if you choose to add other children to the mix, some day that you add those in and maintain your strong unit of a family, and those connection. Um, is that what I'm hearing you say is where you really wanna go with this? 

01:37:25
AMBER This absolute-, I mean that's definitely how I'm feeling, I mean- 

01:37:30
ZACH Yeah, yeah. 

01:37:30
AMBER We just, that's the problem we're having is just can't quite be a cohesive family. 

01:37:35
ZACH You know that's, it's life. Life happens. 

01:37:40
HOLLY NIKEL Sure, sure absolutely. 

01:37:40
ZACH But I think it's a way of how we go about working with it, you know, um, I wouldn't say that there's no um, how do I wanna word this, uh, we get along, and I'm not saying like tolerate, we get along, I mean I'm there for her, she's there for me, you know and I'll be there for her, stepson, my stepson, but, actually her son, my step son, but uh, how we, when we're both stressed, because as she mentioned, her business isn't doing the best. 

01:38:10
HOLLY NIKEL Struggling, right- 

01:38:10
ZACH And that, you know affects how she's doing, and I'm at work all the time. And then come back home and you know, I hadn't really talked and really spoke to her, she wants to tell me her business, she has no one to talk to about it, so she has to call, you know, mom who uh, lives in St. Louis, so it's not like just like an easy drive down there, her sister lives in Chicago, she lives like right in the middle, so she can't just like readily see them. You know she calls them and talks to 'em and then you know I'm supposed to be there and I'm not really there to hear these things. So then she gets a little frustrated. And then- 

01:38:45
AMBER We just have no idea what's going on, almost feels like we're leading two different lives. 

01:38:50
HOLLY NIKEL Well yeah, that sounds like it. So when you say she gets a little frustrated with that, tell me do you get frustrated? 

01:38:55
ZACH Um, see well the thing is, is that she doesn't like the way I address my frustration. 

01:39:00
HOLLY NIKEL Oh, okay, let's hear more about that. How do you address your frustrations? 

01:39:05
ZACH I'm not a yeller, I'm not a screamer. Okay, and she doesn't really yell, she's vocal, you know she's raise her voice, and I'm saying yelling, but she- 

01:39:20
HOLLY NIKEL Gonna make her point. 

01:39:20
ZACH You know and then, instead of saying something, I'm going to regret, or giving into an action that might uh, ruin this relationship beyond repair, I'm one of those that shuts down. She hates that. Underlined, capitalized, hates that. 

01:39:40
HOLLY NIKEL And you keep trying? 

01:39:40
AMBER Yes. It just, I feel like oh, like I got, okay, cause now he's listening, and he just completely shuts down. I mean it's to the point, he'll even put headphones on. 

01:39:50
ZACH Yeah... 

01:39:55
HOLLY NIKEL You really do shut down. 

01:39:55
ZACH Yeah, I don't have my iPod on me right now, not that I wanna put it on right now, but I'm just showing that I pull that out and then, put the headphones on, and then. She doesn't like that. 

01:40:05
HOLLY NIKEL So it's interesting, then, for someone who has a tendency to disconnect or wants to, to disconnect from conflict. One, it's interesting you're an attorney. Just kind of interesting to me. 

01:40:15
ZACH Well, in the court setting, it's different. 

01:40:15
HOLLY NIKEL Right, cause then that's where you- 

01:40:20
ZACH I'm defending someone. 

01:40:20
HOLLY NIKEL You're good at engaging there, is what you're saying, okay- 

01:40:20
ZACH Right, I'm defending someone, that's job, like separating job from family, you know my family needs to come first, and the last thing I wanna do is make her upset. And when she's upset, I don't wanna increase to it and it, which is weird because I'm trying to say to myself, and I add more to that. When in essence, is what I do. You know, so, but in the courtroom, I know, I'm sorry if it didn't make sense, but- 

01:40:45
HOLLY NIKEL No, no it doesn't have to make sense, it's interesting. 

01:40:45
ZACH In the courtroom, that's work, you know, that's work, I got a job to do. Yeah. 

01:40:50
HOLLY NIKEL Right, and you're good at that job and, and you feel comfortable in that job. 

01:40:55
ZACH Right, focus, on work, I'm going to work, and I'm going to defend my client. That's what happens when I come home, I don't wanna see her upset. And I know she's gonna be upset, I don't wanna see her upset, and then I don't wanna say anything that's gonna make things worse, so- 

01:41:10
AMBER We just can't have a conversation, I mean it just doesn't exist. 

01:41:15
ZACH I've been talking all day too, so. You know. 

01:41:20
HOLLY NIKEL Okay, so that's a piece of it as well. You know as I, as I'm listening to all of these things sort of running through my head and all these ideas that I have, one of the questions I, I want you to step back and think about for just a minute is Rufus, okay, and in, he's 10, you're in your early 30s I would assume? 

01:41:45
AMBER Um, uh, he's almost 30- 

01:41:45
ZACH 28. 

01:41:45
HOLLY NIKEL Okay, you're in your late 20s. Well, just aged myself right there, but, um- 

01:41:50
ZACH You look 25- 

01:41:55
HOLLY NIKEL Well, thank you, so, um, if we think about Rufus sitting here, imagine Rufus sitting here, 20 years from now, 15 years from now, with his partner, the person he loves, the person he's committed to spend his life with, and I would say to Rufus, tell me about your home growing up, what do you want him to say? What do you- 

01:42:20
ZACH As a 10 year old right now? 

01:42:20
HOLLY NIKEL No, as a 20 year old, as a 25 year old, 30 year old man, sitting with his, with the love of his life, the person he's committed- 

01:42:30
AMBER I don't want him to be sitting in somewhere having marital problems, I don't want that- 

01:42:35
ZACH Right, but I don't think he would think that his home life was bad. His needs are addressed, you know, I, you could say I guess I neglect him for being at work all the time, but, no I'm not saying you are, but I'm saying you could see it that way, I mean, you could, you could make a case for that. And I mean as far as having the marital problem that we have, just while we're here talking to you, but I don't think he would see it as I had a bad home life, you know, uh, my folks, I never was, never anything to do, we're always fighting. I wouldn't say we always fight, but we have arguments. 

01:43:05
HOLLY NIKEL But my question is, I mean I understand-, what my question is, what do you want him to say, what do you want him to say- 

01:43:15
AMBER What we hope he would say? 

01:43:15
HOLLY NIKEL Yeah, what would you want him to say in the perfect situation he would come and say- 

01:43:20
ZACH I'd want him to be real about it, you know, my mom and dad, they loved me, they got into it sometimes, but still- 

01:43:25
HOLLY NIKEL And what do you hope he would learn from that? Because I think that is real and I that's the reality of marriage, I've been married 12 years, let me tell you, this idea that they sell you with the wedding and the big dress, that's not reality, you guys know that right, it's hard, hard, hard work. So what would you, what meaning would you want him to be able to come back, to step back and say, you know what I learned from my mom and my dad or my mom and step dad, you know I keep, and I know you are a step dad, but your role really is, you're the man figure in his life. So you are technically his step dad, but you really, you're a dad, too. And so what lessons do you hope that he would learn from you as his dad, and you as his mom and you as a couple about how to work things through? 

01:44:15
AMBER I would hope that he would know how to communicate with his wife someday and be able to- 

01:44:20
ZACH Don't wanna hear my shutting down. 

01:44:25
HOLLY NIKEL Okay, so you don't want him-, so the meaning you want him to get to get, to do something different? To engage? 

01:44:30
ZACH Find something that works for him. I'm not saying this works for me, I mean I selfishly may feel better about it, but I know she doesn't, you know, and that's not, that's not, right and that's not the way to go about it, so, if he's going to take something from me, you know how to deal with things in life, don't inherit my shutting down, talk to 'em, but still you know, I don't know if you would necessarily say play fair, you know, but talk to 'em and try to understand what's going on. You know. 

01:44:55
HOLLY NIKEL Okay, so you would want him to learn from you for his relationships in the future. You want him to learn listening and respect, patience back and forth, clearly as I watch the two of you interact, there's great love, there's great connection, there's good friendship, good comradery, you bounce off each other really nicely, um, that's an amazing thing for a kid to see, an amazing, thing, um, how great to grow up in a home where even though your parents argue, because there are people living in the same house, you're gonna argue- 

01:45:35
ZACH How long, how long are you going to, with this one person. I mean I look at my mom and dad married now 31 years, 32 years this summer, I don't know how they do it. 

01:45:45
HOLLY NIKEL You know it-, I said to my 10 year old son on a number of occasions, family we love each other, but we all live in the same house and there are practicalities with that where sometimes we just gonna get on each other's nerves. You just gotta learn to work it through. 

01:46:00
AMBER Yeah, that's very true. 

01:46:00
HOLLY NIKEL You know, and I think that, that helping kids learn that. So I think, one thing I want you to, to think about as you leave this session today is not only what you want from him to learn, and what you want to model for him, but the positive things that you already have modeled, I suspect that there is a lot of that there. I'm guessing that one of the things he's learning from you is about hard work. I do not imagine that this young man will be lazy. 

01:46:25
ZACH I won't let him, no. I won't let him be lazy. 

01:46:30
HOLLY NIKEL You know, and why, but he's not seeing that. He has a father figure who's working really hard to do what's best for his family, and he has a mom who's chasing her dreams and who's working on this, building her business, building a boutique, artistic, I'm guess, you seem kind of artistic to me, okay, so he's also getting this great mix of two really diverse people. Business, hardworking, analytical, artistic, creative, that's pretty cool. That's a pretty great thing to be able to take into the world, right? 

01:47:10
AMBER Yeah, I never really thought about it that way. 

01:47:10
ZACH Niether did I. 

01:47:15
HOLLY NIKEL It's pretty neat, I mean to be able to function around people in different realms like that. So you've got, you've given, you given that much. And if that's a piece you wanna keep, then you can take care to do that. You wanna learn about communication. You want him to learn about working together, you know, what have you shown him about that so far, what do you need to improve on? You wanna teach him about hard work, do you want him to learn a little bit more about balance? That sounds like an area maybe the two of you need to work on. 

01:47:45
ZACH Yeah I'm a workaholic and, that's not the best thing. 

01:47:50
AMBER Tough struggle in our household. 

01:47:50
HOLLY NIKEL Sure, sure, especially when you are trying to make partner, and you are owning your own business, because I know both of those things like over 20 hours a day, seven days a week. You don't need sleep. 

01:48:00
AMBER Right- 

01:48:05
ZACH I sleep, I sleep at the office. I sometimes sleep at the office. You know. 

01:48:10
HOLLY NIKEL It's hard work, so I think the important thing is you, as you think about these sort of situations, look at what are we giving him we want to, we want to teach him, and what are still needing? What does he still need to learn? It's coming fast. I remember when my son turned nine, I said to my husband he's halfway done living in our house. My husband's response actually was eh, don't bank on that. But really, boom, just like that. 

01:48:40
AMBER It's true, it really, it happens so fast, he's a teenager- 

01:48:45
HOLLY NIKEL Almost, and then they're gone. And so everything that they're going to learn, everything he-, not everything, but a good chunk of what he's going to learn is gonna come from you, and so you can step back for his sake and for the sake of your marriage, not just for him, and figure out what all this means to you. Why do you work? I'm guessing, hundred or more hours a week. Why do you, why, what is the, what meaning does that give you in your life, what does that bring to you. 

01:49:15
ZACH Let you know right now why I do it? 

01:49:15
HOLLY NIKEL Yeah, if you can do it now, or if you can, if you can answer it now, great. 

01:49:20
ZACH I love my job, and you know I don't have any issue with her being an independent having her own business. But if I hit this, promotion, you know, she wouldn't have to work if she didn't want to. 

01:49:35
HOLLY NIKEL You wanna provide for you family. 

01:49:35
ZACH You know and another thing is she loves to travel. She loves to travel, she loves to go places, okay, she's fancy, I'm not saying she's high maintenance, I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that, because she kinda looked at me like, she like, she like, uh- I know what that meant. No she likes to go places, she likes to do things, she's a very social person if you haven't noticed, she likes to be around people. 

01:49:55
HOLLY NIKEL And that's why you fell in love with her. 

01:50:00
ZACH You know, right, and so you know she wants to see different parts of the world, one of her favorite spots is Las Vegas. She loves to hang out. So you know, if we, I hit this, I get more time- 

01:50:10
HOLLY NIKEL To take her to Vegas- 

01:50:10
ZACH Well whoever she wants to go! She wants to go to Europe, we can hit Europe, you know, that's this, I, we can do this. And if the business, her business doesn't work out as well, as she envisioned it to, it's okay, we know we got it taken care of. I just have to work 70 hours a day, but-, you know- 

01:50:30
HOLLY NIKEL So this is a means to an ends for you, because what I'm hearing you say is that you loved this woman and this life with her and her son so much- 

01:50:40
ZACH Him too, he can go to Europe too- 

01:50:45
HOLLY NIKEL Him too, can I come? 

01:50:45
ZACH We're gonna have someone to babysit him? You know we're gonna go to Europe for two weeks, you know, would you mind watching Rufus right now, of course he's coming. 

01:50:55
HOLLY NIKEL But, you know listening to what you're saying is, she matters so much, your relationship matters so much, that child matters so much that you will work yourself to death to accomplish that for her. 

01:51:05
ZACH And I know no other way because this is what my family does, my grandfather was the same way, my dad's the same way, you know they, they worked, I mean, we got up and we get up and go to work. We don't miss work, unless you have a 112 degree fever or something like that you know- 

01:51:20
HOLLY NIKEL And then you go in and show your boss that your fever is in fact 112-, right, I get it, I'm married to the same guy, I can. Absolutely, but we also know that there's a cost for that. Okay, so finding the balance to offset a little bit of that cost in the meantime, because what you don't wanna do is work so hard that you don't get to reap the benefits of what you're working-, what this all means to you, which is being a great provider, a great husband, a great partner, a great father. And for you, Amber, um, the meaning of creating your creative niche, being a mom, being a wife, being supportive. Out of all of those things factoring into you, how do you balance that. With sort of what, what all that means to you. 

01:52:15
AMBER I mean, I want him to know that it, he don't have, I don't want him to work himself to death, I mean I just want our family. I don't need fancy trips, I don't need fancy things, and I, I- 

01:52:30
ZACH She doesn't need, but she likes it- 

01:52:30
AMBER I tell him that though but it's true, I just want him to be around more. 

01:52:35
HOLLY NIKEL Have you ever asked him if he knows that? 

01:52:35
AMBER No, I guess not. Do you know that? 

01:52:40
ZACH I do not. 

01:52:40
HOLLY NIKEL Well look at how great that went. 

01:52:45
AMBER It really is true though, we just want you. 

01:52:45
HOLLY NIKEL But we also know what I know, now know after 30 minutes is that um, that that's part of who Zach is, is a hard working guy. That's part of what you fell in love with- 

01:53:05
ZACH You knew that in college. 

01:53:05
AMBER I've known that all along. 

01:53:05
HOLLY NIKEL Okay, good, which is probably the thing that drew you two together, because think of the balance you provide for each other. 

01:53:10
ZACH And she's really funny. 

01:53:10
HOLLY NIKEL She is funny, actually you're kinda funny too, the two of you are really funny couple. 

01:53:15
ZACH She's really funny. 

01:53:20
HOLLY NIKEL I would imagine that the two of you have a really good time together if you just let loose and have a good time together. Okay. 

01:53:25
AMBER It's been a long time since that's happened. 

01:53:25
HOLLY NIKEL So let's think about something that the two of you can do together, small, I'm not saying, here's the deal Zach, 40 hours a week, that's it. You're home, you are home. Because what can happen in that, that scenario is he's not living out the thing that's most meaningful to him, which is this job and the thing that he's good at and creating this life that he wants to build for his family, and then what can happen is resentment, now you guys are back and we have a whole 'nother problem, he's mad because you're making him stay home. 

01:53:55
AMBER I don't want that. 

01:53:55
HOLLY NIKEL This is not gonna happen, right? But then the other scenario, you just do what you're doing, I'll do what I do and I'll keep going, well now you've got a whole nother problem. Which is the problem you're starting to find yourselves in right now, which is where we come in together. So, to think about things that are important to your relationship, important to the two of you that you can do together, on a smaller scale. So we know that Saturday's, there's no court. I don't know is there court on Saturdays? 

01:54:25
ZACH Usually, no. 

01:54:25
HOLLY NIKEL I'm not, I don't do a lot of court things. Um, so we know maybe Saturday mornings, the two of you will have set up something that the two of you will do together, or that the three of you will do together, right, and you set aside, you can set aside an hour, a week, you'd be amazed at what an hour a week can do to a relationship. How it can change the focus. Or whatever the case may be. However you wanna do that, I mean that's just a suggestion, the time you need to set aside an hour on Saturdays. What I am saying is for you to be able to look for opportunities where you can take these important things that brought you together, remind each other of what they are, um, spend some time together. Spend some time with your son, who needs you. You're teaching him, like it or not, how to be a man. Because he's almost there. And what kind of a man do you want him to be? You know and he's not gonna learn that by you just telling him. That's not how they get it. You learned to be a man from your dad. Sounds like your dad taught you some really important lessons. 

01:55:30
ZACH He's pretty cool. 

01:55:35
HOLLY NIKEL That's what I would like Rufus to be saying, um, one day. Be sitting here and saying my dad was really cool and you know what he taught me? He taught me that work is really important, but so is family. And how can you pull all that together. But it really does start with deciding what, one of those most important things to you, and then how can you go ahead and uh, show those in smaller ways. It doesn't, not that changes your, you don't have to change your whole schedule, but that those small things will change your life. And change your experience as well. It's how you look at it, it's how you perceive it. Does that make sense? 

01:56:10
AMBER It does, it makes a lot of sense. 

01:56:15
ZACH Absolutely. 

01:56:15
HOLLY NIKEL Is that something you think that the two of you can sit down together sometime- 

01:56:15
AMBER I think for sure, I mean it's definitely an easy step that we can make and I mean don't you think we can easily do that, yes? Thank you? 

01:56:25
ZACH Yes. 

01:56:25
HOLLY NIKEL Thing is that you found an hour, 32 minutes to be here today to do that. So you already done it. You've already found the time. It's, you've already shown this is important enough for me to carve time out of my boutique, time with my son, and um- 

01:56:45
ZACH I'm not at the office! 

01:56:45
AMBER That's true. 

01:56:45
ZACH I'm not at the office. 

01:56:45
AMBER Gold star for you. 

01:56:50
ZACH Thanks babe. 

01:56:50
HOLLY NIKEL Okay, how about we uh, give that some time to uh, settle down and maybe we can get together some other time and see how that's going, get together and talk about what the next step might be- 

01:57:00
AMBER Wonderful, thank you. 

01:57:00
HOLLY NIKEL No problem, thank you for coming in. Okay, so I just had the opportunity with Zach and Amber for our first meeting, um, I tried to use some logo therapy with them. Um, I don't know that I particularly went into as much meaning, specific meanings questions that I might have done normally, had I had just a little bit more time. Um, however, we were able to establish a bit of what's important to them and how it is that they uh, choose to make decisions about their life, How Zach working hard is an important part of who he is and what that means to him and why it's important to him. So, we're able to tie into some of those sorts of meaning-focused things. Uh, a lot of issues that they brought up, parenting, step parenting, um, couples work, all of which really are about providing, are all driven by, I should say, what you believe in your core about life. You know the professions we choose and the partner we choose and the legacy we want to leave on to our children. So we were able to briefly touch up on some of those things with them today. Um, I think that if I were to continue working with uh, Zach and Amber, we would look more at that. We would look at, um, how they balance that, all the things that are going on in their lives, how they stay connected with one another. I would talk more with them about the legacy that they individually wanna leave behind, a big piece of logo-therapy really is, is future focused, which is some of what we were trying to, I was trying to do today, so it's future focused theory. What, where do I wanna go? What is my end point and how am I gonna, where are my steps to get there. But not necessarily in a goal sort of sense, but in a mission. What is my mission in life, what is my legacy. I think I've said that now four times, but, what is my legacy that I wanna leave behind and am I living my life in a way that if I were to not be here tomorrow, that I, I could look back and know that my work here is done. So we started to do some of that today with, uh, Zach and Amber, I would continue to work with them on that. Think they are a neat, energetic couple who has a lot to offer, and uh, I want them to see that. In themselves, again. Uh, we did a little bit of that with them actually as well, today, did a little bit of looking at their situation, from a different perspective. So I asked, um, what they thought Rufus might say about them, and what they would want them to say about them, or possibly, giving them an option of looking at another way of identifying the lessons they've already taught him in a positive way. Or the lessons they've taught each other. So it's that idea of just stepping back a little bit and looking at it from a new perspective and making a meaning out of it, and making and looking at does that meaning get me where it is I wanted to go in the end. So, yes. 

02:00:15
Wrap-Up with All the Participants 

02:00:20
EDWARD HAMANN Well Zach and Amber, first of all I wanna thank you for participating in our project today. Um, I don't really have an agenda to what I wanna do at this point, except to maybe ask each of you how you cared to respond to these three experiences that you've had, uh, how you would compare, contrast, reactions, if you can kinda just roll with your reactions of what happened, and then let us know- 

02:00:45
AMBER My brain is exhausted. I'm just joking- 

02:00:45
EDWARD HAMANN I'm sure, I'm sure, you've been through a lot. 

02:00:50
AMBER We have experienced so much in such a short time. 

02:00:55
ZACH We've come a long way. 

02:00:55
AMBER Now I, I found it really, uh, helpful in different ways. Each one of you were very different, and I'm sure that what you were trying to portray, but I definitely got that from each one of you and your styles were different and helpful and all different ways. Um, like I felt very much, with you, Ed, all of you, I felt very comfortable with, um, and I felt like I could say what I needed to say. Um, Ed, your style felt very much like, okay, like, uh, proactive, I guess, and like here's what you need to go home and work on, like something to think about and then you're so easy to talk to. Like I totally felt relaxed and like an easy atmosphere and you were very relatable. And then with you, I felt it was more emotional. Um, and very, like, uh, just attaching to the center of life finding the love in the relationship. So, they were all very different. But helpful. 

02:02:00
EDWARD HAMANN Okay, Zach, thoughts, reactions? That you can share with us? 

02:02:00
ZACH Um, I enjoyed it. Thoroughly, it was a good time. Um, everyone was very easy to talk to as Amber said. Um, very, well, I would say two or three were similar and one was different. I would say Ed and uh, my man here were similar in the sense that it was a little bit more, I don't wanna use serious, but a little bit more, um, I don't know the word I wanna use, it was, it was serious, nothing like emotionally frightening, or anything like that, but Ed had his scale, he said one to 10, I want you to tell me, very much, and he took his note pad, had his note pad out and he has no, he has paper and he's taking notes and he consistently said, and I don't think this at all, he consistently said I'm gonna ask you something weird. 

02:02:50
AMBER Bracing us. 

02:02:50
ZACH But I want your honest answer. And nothing was weird to me. I didn't feel like anything was weird or inappropriate at all, you know and he had his scale like one to 10, so we have this at a seven, what's one thing we could do to bring it down to a six, so you know, that was, I could see how that works out as good. Uh, my man here was probably the most emotional, and I would say the most serious on how things were because he would ask us something, talk, well, don't tell me about it, tell her, look at her and tell her this is how you feel about this. And that was, and that could get hard, that could be tough, you know, because you're telling your feelings directly to this person, which I think is good, but at the same time I can see how that can be a little overbearing for some. Not for me, uh, maybe for- 

02:03:35
AMBER Our love is so strong, we transcend that. 

02:03:40
ZACH That's right nothing can come between us, um, so uh, that was, I mean, that's very human but it can be also very difficult, because he told me straight up, well don't tell me, tell her this is how you feel, and I had to look at Amber and let her know that well, okay, and also the fear, he, he focused on fear, like this is what you're afraid of, and how is it that you can change that. And it's hard to some people to admit that they have fear on anything. So to go with that aspect was very, um, it was, it was very emotional, uh, it was very, uh, engaging, and it was, it was a good experience just to have, cause it makes you think, you know you're not just gonna give us some token answer, I don't think you would accept a token answer. You know and I need something that I can work with here, so- 

02:04:25
AMBER No, no, you will look at her- 

02:04:30
ZACH Yeah, you know this is how this is gonna work, and then uh, Holly's was the most, she had the most fun, where she was in there, she was very conversation-based. Laughing with us, yes, laughing with us. Very, uh, very conversational, okay, this is good, this is what happens here, and this is what you can work on for the future, so that was good too, so it was different styles, but all of them I think, I think you all reached what you were trying to get. You all accomplished what you were going for, so there's my long-winded answer to- 

02:05:05
EDWARD HAMANN No, that's very helpful, it sounds like the contrasts then, are perhaps, if I can read into what you're saying, the differences were some were cognitively oriented and some were emotionally oriented, is that what you're, what you're saying? Mm-hm. 

02:05:15
AMBER Definitely. Yeah, I mean like we were saying with the looking at each other, when you were doing that it's like you don't realize how little people don't look at each other, it's very true, and I mean I never really thought about it until you know we done that exercise, but I, I think that it's interesting too that all three were very different types of therapy and in a different session, but at the same time you all really did come down to the same conclusions, basically, but just in, worded very differently, but basically the same conclusion. 

02:05:45
ZACH There was nothing uncomfortable about it, nothing like that- 

02:05:50
AMBER I was very comfortable. 

02:05:50
ZACH Yeah, it was fine, I mean like we had no problem talking however long we needed to. We needed to go longer that'd be fine, too. But you gotta understand that we both have, we both have a degree in speaking, so that's not a problem, for either one of us, so. You know, yeah. 

02:06:05
EDWARD HAMANN Different styles, uh, got different things out of the experience, based on the style that we, we provided for you. Uh huh. 

02:06:15
HOLLY NIKEL Well, as you two were talking about, how we sort of all, we were laughing, and it occurred to me then as we were doing, cause I was doing my pre-, this is what my theory was about, then humor is a big piece of, of logo therapy and being able to stand back and laugh at yourself and say this is crazy, what am I, my behavior is so different than my goal. And so how can I put that together, and so when you said that I was like, ah, humor. Oh, forgot about humor. Humor can be very therapeutic. 

02:06:45
AMBER Yeah, I felt very comfortable with you, yeah, and very relatable, like and I, I dig that, I respond well to that, so, I liked that. 

02:06:50
HOLLY NIKEL Well, thanks. Cause you're easy to relate to as well. But I do think that, that it was interesting to hear your perspectives on how things work. So. 

02:07:00
EDWARD HAMANN Any concluding comments, Shawn? That you care to share? 

02:07:05
SHAWN PARMENON Well I think it was nicely said that although we have three different theoretical perspectives, it was sort of the same end goal that we were working on, I think that's pretty characteristic of theories. Cause really it sort of fits what we do and what we see as important to change, cause then we're more congruent, right? And I think the client's gonna work and grow in the experience with us being ourselves and operating from that point of view. But really sometimes it just comes down to the very, very same end result, and I think that's important. 

02:07:30
HOLLY NIKEL Yeah as they were describing that I was thinking well you just described Ed's personality, you just described Shawn's personality, you described my personality. Which in fact, uh, probably has a big influence on what we choose then to do for theory, because it comes out of who we are as a person, so. 

02:07:45
EDWARD HAMANN Anything else as, we care to share with audience? 

02:07:50
AMBER Um, I found it a really neat refreshing experience, like I've never done anything like this, I've never been in a therapy session at all before, so. 

02:08:00
ZACH I've talked to a professional, but I don't, you know, not this aspect of you know being, having a wife and, you know things like that but I think it's a good thing. I think it's good to talk to people. Um, it's nice to talk to you guys, none of you were mean, so that, you know, and- 

02:08:15
AMBER Save it up for the next round. 

02:08:20
ZACH And you know it's something that I would, I would do again, I had a good time, doing it. And I wasn't nervous either, I know you weren't, you had no problems being in, there was no nerves, and you weren't sweating or shaking or nothing like that, it was good, it was fun. 

02:08:35
EDWARD HAMANN Well again I would just say thank you for the two of you for giving your time, for, for being consistent in your roles- 

02:08:40
ZACH School's over, so, got time. 

02:08:40
EDWARD HAMANN It added a lot to the experience, and I appreciate that, thanks very much. 

02:08:45
ZACH Thank you guys. 

02:08:45
AMBER Thank you.
