Solution Focused Brief Therapy With Dr. Ed Hamann Introduction to Solution Focused Brief Therapy 

00:00:00
ED HAMANN  I'm Dr. Ed Hamann, a professor of Counselor Education. What you are about watch is a demonstration of three counseling approaches with a young woman named Adrianne who will be roleplaying an adolescent client. I will be demonstrating Solution Focused Therapy, my colleague Dr. Bill McFarland will be demonstrating Reality Therapy and my colleague Dr. Carrie Alexander-Albritton will be demonstrating Cognitive Behavior Therapy. The process will go something like this. Each of us will give a brief overview of the counseling approach that we intend to demonstrate. The interview with Adrianne will take place next and then following each of our interviews with Adrianne we will briefly share our thoughts about how the interview went. Following all three of these interviews, my colleagues, Adrianne and I will together discuss Adrianne's thoughts, feelings, reactions to the various counseling approaches. It is my hope that this experience will be both interesting and educational for you. I do want to add my sincere appreciation and thanks to Adrianne for her participation in this experience. Well, let me now then begin with a brief overview of Solution Focused Therapy which I think most of you probably realize was developed by the late Steve de Shazer and Insoo Kim Berg during the 1970's at the Brief Family Therapy Center in Milwaukee. John Walter, Jane Peller, Michele Weiner-Davis, Bill O'Hanlon among others have written extensively about Solution Focused Therapy and have started their own Solution Focused Therapy Training Institutes. This approach is oriented toward the future and what is possible for clients. Neither the past nor the present are important to this approach in fact de Shazer even suggested it was not necessarily, necessary to know the problem in order to solve it. Solution Focused Therapy believes that small changes lead to big changes. Clients choose the goals they wish to accomplish, the therapist functions as a collaborator or co-creator of solutions that the client wishes to work on. The process of change focuses on the positive, on solution development, on support for progress and the celebration of change. The process of Solution Focused Therapy involves a series of questions. The miracle question help establish the client's goal. The exception question helps to remind the client of times when the problem did not even exist and scaling questions provide some data and establish a behavioral direction to the process of change. I personally find this approach of counseling to be very optimistic and enjoy using it in my counseling with clients. I now invite you to watch a demonstration of Solution Focused Therapy with Adrianne.

Simulated Demonstration 

00:03:50
ED HAMANN  Hi Adrianne, I'm Ed Hamann. It's nice to meet you. I'd like to begin if it's okay with you just by getting acquainted a little bit uhm, ask you a few question. Do you mind telling me how old you are? 

00:04:05
ADRIANNE Seventeen. 

00:04:05
ED HAMANN Okay. And what year in high school are you? 

00:04:10
ADRIANNE I'm a junior. 

00:04:10
ED HAMANN Junior. Okay. And uh, who lives in your family? 

00:04:15
ADRIANNE Uhm, I have a brother, uhm, dad and my mom. 

00:04:20
ED HAMANN How, how old's your brother? 

00:04:20
ADRIANNE He's out of the house. 

00:04:25
ED HAMANN He's older that you then? 

00:04:25
ADRIANNE Yeah. So I'm the only child in the house. 

00:04:25
ED HAMANN You're the one at home so... (crosstalk) 

00:04:25
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

00:04:25
ED HAMANN ...you and mom and dad are there. Okay, very good. Uhm, what is it that you'd like to talk about. 

00:04:35
ADRIANNE Uhm, I just wanna talk about how lately I've just been really really stressed out and there were alarming situations and decisions that I have to make, make or not, are not being let make myself... (crosstalk) 

00:04:45
ED HAMANN Okay. 

00:04:45
ADRIANNE ...by my parents. It's just, it's really hard and it's really pressuring. I'm trying to understand it at it, at their angle but it's like kinda just, it's really difficult to... (crosstalk) 

00:04:55
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. 

00:04:55
ADRIANNE ...make decisions for myself. 

00:05:00
ED HAMANN 'Coz you're trying to make some decisions for yourself and it sounds like from what you're saying mom and dad having input into that and that's stressing you out and frustrating... (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
ADRIANNE Yeah and just like, like college coming up and, you know, choosing which one I wanna go to. It's just, (sigh) it's so difficult. (crosstalk) 

00:05:15
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. 

00:05:15
ADRIANNE It's, (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:05:19
ED HAMANN  Well, I can se, sort of see that difficulty in you. It did looks like it's weighing pretty heavily on you. (crosstalk) 

00:05:25
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

00:05:25
ED HAMANN For sure. Okay. Anything else you care to say about that? 

00:05:30
ADRIANNE Uhm, I don't know. A lot of people say it's just my age and all that stuff that's why I'm feeling like this and it's just I, I agree and I'm probably, you know, when I'm older I'll agree too but just right now it really does not seem like it. It kinda just seems like they don't understand that I am not getting through to them and they're not getting through to me. So they say. 

00:05:55
ED HAMANN They being mom and dad... (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
ADRIANNE Yes. 

00:05:55
ED HAMANN ...primarily. 

00:05:55
ADRIANNE Yes. About like situations or even like, even just a schoolwork, you know, it's just, it's overwhelming and I just wanna, it's one of the problems. (crosstalk) 

00:06:05
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. 

00:06:05
ADRIANNE That's just one example and it's really hard. 

00:06:05
ED HAMANN One example being thoughts about college and... (crosstalk) 

00:06:10
ADRIANNE Yeah. College, school, schoolwork. I have a job. (crosstalk) 

00:06:15
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. 

00:06:15
ADRIANNE It's just, it's hard, it's also time for myself isn't there. 

00:06:20
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. Well, that sounds like a lot. Anything else that would help me get a sense of what's going on for you? 

00:06:30
ADRIANNE Uhm, I'm really having uh, problems trying to apply to colleges and link with money and it's like that, trying to do that and it's just, it's really hard 'coz I do have a job myself and everything and it's just, I'm trying really hard and I'm, I'm just so ove, really overwhelmed. 

00:06:45
ED HAMANN Hmm. Well I can really see that again. Let me ask you what may sound like somewhat of odd question, okay? 

00:06:55
ADRIANNE Okay. 

00:06:55
ED HAMANN But it, it goes like this and it's actually called the miracle question. So what I want you to think about is, you know, we finish our interview and you go on home and finish what you need to do today but eventually the end of the day will come and you're gonna go to bed and go to sleep. I want you to imagine that during the course of the time that you're sleeping tonight a miracle happens so that some of these problems that you're feeling and the stress is going on for you are gone because the miracle happened. What would you notice tomorrow that would be different? That would let you know, I, I think a miracle has happened? 

00:07:35
ADRIANNE Maybe uh, (laughs) if my parents would let me make my own decisions and just approve of everything I do. That would be a miracle... (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
ED HAMANN Uh-huh. 

00:07:40
ADRIANNE  in itself. (laughs) 

00:07:45
ED HAMANN Okay. 

00:07:45
ADRIANNE And uh, being able to kinda do my own thing where being more of an individual I guess. (crosstalk) 

00:07:50
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. 

00:07:50
ADRIANNE  Man, if money just appeared (laughs) that would be a miracle too. (laughs) 

00:07:55
ED HAMANN That would be nice, wouldn't it? (laughs) 

00:07:55
ADRIANNE Yeah. And uh, schoolwork. It would be great if that kinda lightens a little bit. (crosstalk) 

00:08:05
ED HAMANN Yeah. 

00:08:05
ADRIANNE To save time like in me and that really would help out too but it still be kinda cool. 

00:08:10
ED HAMANN What wouldn't help out in the end? 

00:08:10
ADRIANNE If schoolwork just disappeared. 

00:08:15
ED HAMANN Okay, (laughs) that would be nice when if it... (crosstalk) 

00:08:15
ADRIANNE It would be nice but... (crosstalk) 

00:08:15
ED HAMANN Yeah. 

00:08:15
ADRIANNE In the end it wouldn't really prepare me for college or anything. 

00:08:20
ED HAMANN So, let me be sure I got what you said if tomorrow you woke up and you knew a miracle had happened. Your parents would be letting you make your own decisions, you'd uh, do your own thing being individual uhm, you know, money would sort of fall (laughs) in the sky for you and uh, uh, there would be no more schoolwork. Okay. Now, it would be helpful to me if I could focused on there little bit in terms of more what you would be doing differently 'coz, you know, this is your miracle. So what would, what would you notice that you would be doing differently? 

00:08:55
ADRIANNE Uhm, I maybe taking more time for myself, definitely. (crosstalk) 

00:09:00
ED HAMANN Yeah. 

00:09:00
ADRIANNE Just really lately it's just, it feels like I have no private status. I don't sit down and just relax 'coz I always have to be busy and yeah, it's just really hard. 

00:09:10
ED HAMANN So more time for yourself, more privacies and anything else that you'd notice you would be doing differently? 

00:09:15
ADRIANNE  Hopefully I'd get happier. (laughs) 

00:09:20
ED HAMANN  Do you have a sense of what you'd be doing if you were feeling happier? 

00:09:30
ADRIANNE I uh, (laughs) I think uhm, lately I just, I've notice and I know other people have noticed too like I haven't really been talking as much. I haven't been participating in class so much 'coz not only is it's just something else that I have to handle or I have to deal with but I'm not really up for. It's just, you know, I don't know. Hopefully like I would be able to hang out with my friends 'coz I really don't have time to do that anymore. It's just, it's not time to have fun... (crosstalk) 

00:09:55
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. 

00:09:55
ADRIANNE ...and I think in that having more time to myself. I could take time to do, you know, some things as well. 

00:10:00
ED HAMANN So if you had more time for yourself, you'd be hanging out with your friends more and I think you said if you would be happier if, sort of show that by talking more in class and... (crosstalk) 

00:10:10
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

00:10:10
ED HAMANN  spending more time with friends. Is that, is that right? 

00:10:15
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

00:10:15
ED HAMANN Okay. Any, anything else you can think that would let you know, man it's, a miracles happened and I'm less stressed, feeling better. 

00:10:25
ADRIANNE I'm, the real parent thing situation is really difficult 'coz having to go to college, they also stresses like which college they want. (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. 

00:10:35
ADRIANNE You know, they've been to that, they think it's great and everything and just like if they're gonna help me pay for it and they said they would but I don't know about all the way. (crosstalk) 

00:10:45
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. (nodding) 

00:10:45
ADRIANNE So, I have to work on that as well. (crosstalk) 

00:10:45
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. (nodding) 

00:10:45
ADRIANNE  And 'coz uhm, I really want to go... (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
ED HAMANN Okay. 

00:10:50
ADRIANNE ...and like that but (laughs) (clears throat) I don't know but... (crosstalk) 

00:10:55
ED HAMANN No, absolutely. Absolutely. Well, I guess I'm wondering from these things that you have indicated would, would be helpful to you if the miracle happened uhm, uh, if you were a, able to pick one or two of those it would feel sort of most important to you to uh, to see change, to, to find some solutions to one or two of all that list. What do you think that would be? 

00:11:20
ADRIANNE Definitely able to make my own decisions. Definitely and then, another one would be more time to myself. (crosstalk) 

00:11:25
ED HAMANN Okay. Okay. Well, let's, let's take a look at that a little bit and if indeed you found that you were able to make more of your own decisions uhm, uh, what do you think would help make that happen? 

00:11:45
ADRIANNE Uhm, I just think that like some things, like with dating or whatever I could do that more like that. (laughs) That would be nice but uh, with my parents it's always about the right person, who I wanna date, as long as they approve and, you know, what, sometimes it's just not to their convenience 'coz they're not to that level... (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
ED HAMANN Hmm. 

00:12:05
ADRIANNE ...where, that I see, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
ED HAMANN Sure, sure. 

00:12:05
ADRIANNE And that, it's a decision uhm, staying out. Like I have really early curfews which doesn't seem right unless I'm working and it's just really hard 'coz I'm not a bad kid at all. I don't party, I don't do any of that stuff but it's like sometimes that's where kids get it when they want to... (crosstalk) 

00:12:25
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. 

00:12:25
ADRIANNE ...'coz I've those feelings. You just wanna go out and have fun and just release and I'm just, I really need to make my own decision to even that out. (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
ED HAMANN Okay. So it would be helpful to you uh, kinda make some your own dating decisions and can choose who you wanna... (crosstalk) 

00:12:40
ADRIANNE Yeah. (laughs) 

00:12:40
ED HAMANN ...go out with. (crosstalk) 

00:12:40
ADRIANNE That would be nice. (laughs) 

00:12:40
ED HAMANN And uh, maybe be able to set your own curfews. Some of those kinds of things. (crosstalk) 

00:12:45
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

00:12:45
ED HAMANN Okay. 

00:12:45
ADRIANNE I can hang out with my friends. (crosstalk) 

00:12:50
ED HAMANN Yeah, alright. And let's look at the other one that you sort of identified if you had more time for yourself and that happened, what would you be doing differently? 

00:13:00
ADRIANNE It just seems like I'm either always at school or working. Like I either, I go to school, I wake up go to school, work, come home, go to bed and if I have homework I'll do that. (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
ED HAMANN Uh-huh. 

00:13:10
ADRIANNE It's, it's just a routine. (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
ED HAMANN  Uh-huh. 

00:13:15
ADRIANNE And I'm not much of a routine person, you know, but, it's, it's really hard 'coz I never take time just to be alone like there's always somebody there, there's always somebody around me and I don't have really a lot of privacy 'coz they hear everything in the house so I can't talk on the phone... (crosstalk) 

00:13:30
ED HAMANN Uh-huh. 

00:13:30
ADRIANNE ...all that much but it's just, it's really starting to get to me. 

00:13:35
ED HAMANN And if that were solved and you had some more of this time for yourself and privacy, what would that look like? 

00:13:45
ADRIANNE I, I think it looked like me getting my own place would be great but same time the responsibilities will come with it it's just a little too much for... (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
ED HAMANN Hmm. 

00:13:55
ADRIANNE ...me being a high school. (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
ED HAMANN Hmm. 

00:13:55
ADRIANNE So I don't if I could go to school and work and pay more, you know, it doesn't solve the money thing. 

00:14:00
ED HAMANN Yeah. Well, that would be nice when you can have your own place but that's probably not gonna be uh, something that's gonna happen right away is it? 

00:14:10
ADRIANNE No. 

00:14:10
ED HAMANN Okay. Let me ask you another uhm, perhaps a bit of an odd question but I want you to think about a scale of one to ten. And let's say that ten is uh, the problem of not being able to make your decisions is at its worst. That's a ten. And one is man, you have the freedom to make all your own decisions and, and that's all great. So in terms of being able to make your own decision, ten is worst, one is all better. Right now, where would you put yourself on that scale? 

00:14:45
ADRIANNE I would put myself on a six or seven 'coz there are a lot of things that really, I mean you know, on and there are just those things... (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
ED HAMANN Okay. 

00:14:55
ADRIANNE Letting me do my own thing but when I do get my own free time it's like they have control over it and they have not dislike people that I have dated. (crosstalk) 

00:15:05
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. 

00:15:05
ADRIANNE And it's just, it's really hard 'coz what do you, what do you tell that person that I can't be with you 'coz my parents don't like you? 

00:15:10
ED HAMANN Alright. 

00:15:10
ADRIANNE You know, like (laughs) they're just gonna laugh at you 'coz not only are you now old enough to make, start making your own decision but it's just, it's really hard. It's kinda making me like a laughingstock... (crosstalk) 

00:15:20
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. 

00:15:20
ADRIANNE ...I guess. 

00:15:20
ED HAMANN Hmm. Wow. 

00:15:20
ADRIANNE  Uh, I don't know. It's, and I just, that's when I just kinda reserve myself. That's why I don't talk so much 'coz... (crosstalk) 

00:15:30
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. 

00:15:30
ADRIANNE ...for them to ask me questions or get me involved in something and haven't like what if that situation came up and what if I had to tell them, you know, like I would talk to my parents first. (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
ED HAMANN Uh-huh. 

00:15:40
ADRIANNE Like and it's just getting really hard 'coz there are some things like, I don't know like getting a piercing like my parents are really conservative, you know, like my ear pierce... (crosstalk) 

00:15:50
ED HAMANN Uh-huh. (nodding) 

00:15:50
ADRIANNE ...like the top of it. Like it's so... (crosstalk) 

00:15:55
ED HAMANN Hmm. (nodding) 

00:15:55
ADRIANNE ...wrong to them. (crosstalk) 

00:15:55
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. 

00:15:55
ADRIANNE And it just something, you know, you own, your own freedom. It's not to an extent. It could be always worst... (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. 

00:16:00
ADRIANNE  but I don't think my parents are really understanding that 'coz they're so strict... (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
ED HAMANN Okay. 

00:16:05
ADRIANNE ...and they always have to know what's going on, what's really (inaudible ), (crosstalk) 

00:16:11
ED HAMANN Sure. 

00:16:11
ADRIANNE What's my business. (crosstalk) 

00:16:11
ED HAMANN Sure. 

00:16:11
ADRIANNE It's my privacy and they're just not getting it. 

00:16:15
ED HAMANN Okay. I understand. (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

00:16:15
ED HAMANN I understand. Uhm, okay so uh, on the scale of severity uh, in terms of being able to make your own decision you said a six or a seven. Uhm, let me ask you this and, and, and I understand how your parents are very much a part of, of what you're dealing with right now but really try to think about what, what you could do to help this problem and what would you do to move just even one notch down on that scale and say six to five that would reduce the severity of this problem. 

00:16:50
ADRIANNE I think maybe if I didn't work as much... (crosstalk) 

00:16:50
ED HAMANN Okay. 

00:16:50
ADRIANNE  I have more time to myself that I could be able to do my own, do more of my own thing... (crosstalk) 

00:17:00
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. 

00:17:00
ADRIANNE ...that they wouldn't have question so much or have to do that stuff. Hopefully they wouldn't but I think maybe they're working as much, just really overwhelmed and not having the time... (crosstalk) 

00:17:10
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. 

00:17:10
ADRIANNE ...is really doing it. 

00:17:10
ED HAMANN Well, almost I think that if, if you work less and had more time to yourself that would help with the, the self time issues... (crosstalk) 

00:17:20
ADRIANNE Hmm. 

00:17:20
ED HAMANN ...as well as with some of the decision. Does that, does that feel accurate to you? 

00:17:25
ADRIANNE Maybe I'll had more time to make my own decisions... (crosstalk) 

00:17:25
ED HAMANN Okay. 

00:17:25
ADRIANNE ...rather than having to deal with it right at that point when I get home or whatever uhm, I thought about that but it's just, right now it's not really the questions for me. 

00:17:35
ED HAMANN Being able to work less? 

00:17:35
ADRIANNE  Yeah. 

00:17:40
ED HAMANN I see. So that's not gonna be a reasonable solution for you right now. 

00:17:45
ADRIANNE Not at this time. 

00:17:45
ED HAMANN Okay. 

00:17:45
ADRIANNE Maybe like summer would be better... (crosstalk) 

00:17:45
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. 

00:17:45
ADRIANNE  There'll be no school. (crosstalk) 

00:17:50
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. Well, let's try to refocus to, to what's going on on your life right now and things that you really could get a hold of and manage for yourself moving just one notch in the positive direction on that scale. Things that you could really do now. 

00:18:05
ADRIANNE Uhm, I don't know. Maybe, you know, maybe me with being more reserved is kinda making it more difficult and complicated as well 'coz that also makes me feel like I don't have time for my friends 'coz it's just probably more to deal with it, more issues and I think that would be maybe, I don't know. I guess I could, I could try that. That would be something but... (crosstalk) 

00:18:30
ED HAMANN Now, you gotta help me. I'm not sure I completely understood that you'd be more reserved you said? 

00:18:35
ADRIANNE Uhm, how I'm not talking as much in the class, how I'm not like coming up with things 'coz I don't want to deal with that, I don't wanna tell them, you know, like, oh I have to talk to my parents. Maybe I could open up more. (crosstalk) 

00:18:45
ED HAMANN Okay. 

00:18:45
ADRIANNE That would call, that would solve problems or issues or why I get that sentence(ph) maybe there. (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. Okay. Alright, open up more, talk more to your friends... (crosstalk) 

00:18:55
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

00:18:55
ED HAMANN We talked about that earlier a little bit. Okay, what else might help you move one notch on that scale? 

00:19:05
ADRIANNE Uhm, I think... (crosstalk) 

00:19:10
ED HAMANN It's hard huh? 

00:19:10
ADRIANNE I think once, once school get's out for the summer. It could really helped. I don't know if that's not, exactly not so possible right now but... (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
ED HAMANN Something to look forward to. (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
ADRIANNE Yeah, definitely something to look forward to. (laughs) 

00:19:25
ED HAMANN But unfortunately we have a few months yet to go on the school year. 

00:19:25
ADRIANNE  Yeah. 

00:19:30
ED HAMANN Well, I'm really, really feeling bad for you. I mean I, I sense this pressure. I, I get an image of things that you really would like to see different but you feel, I guess my sense is kind of trapped right now to make those things happened. Is that, does that feel accurate? 

00:19:45
ADRIANNE Definitely. (nodding) 

00:19:45
ED HAMANN Okay. But kind of the one thing you said that maybe could get a hold of is being more open, talking more with your friends, and... (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
ADRIANNE I mean... (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
ED HAMANN ... in class I think you talked earlier about? 

00:20:00
ADRIANNE Yeah. 'Cause I, I mean at first I didn't notice that I was doing that but like now that I am noticing I'm thinking, you know, maybe it would better if I change that. 

00:20:10
ED HAMANN Okay. I know you didn't really say this but I guess I wonder if a piece of it would be if you're becoming more open with friends would it, do you think it would help if you were more open with your parents as well? (clears throat) 

00:20:25
ADRIANNE I mean like I've tried to be more open. Like I said one time they didn't like who I dated or... (crosstalk) 

00:20:30
ED HAMANN Yeah. 

00:20:30
ADRIANNE ...something like that. It's just every time when I, when like I wanna hang out with him or whatever or do my own thing more stuff... (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
ED HAMANN Yeah. 

00:20:40
ADRIANNE ...make my own decision, make my own mistakes, that thing, that in general. It's like they're not, they're not open. (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
ED HAMANN  Uh hmm. 

00:20:50
ADRIANNE They're not the one who's open minded to anything. (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
ED HAMANN Uh-huh. 

00:20:50
ADRIANNE 'Coz I'm not the bad kid and there could always be worst. (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
ED HAMANN Sure. 

00:20:55
ADRIANNE And I don't think they really understand that. (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
ED HAMANN Okay. Let me go back to the, the scale for a second. We talked a little bit about what maybe you could do uh, to help with the, the decision making uhm, the other kind of solution you'd like to work toward just finding ways to have more time for yourself. So let's again think of one to ten and ten is you have absolutely no time (clears throat) for yourself and one is, you know, you have all the time that you need. Again where would you put yourself now on that scale? 

00:21:30
ADRIANNE I'd say an eight 'coz I have weekends that I usually don't work. (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
ED HAMANN Okay. 

00:21:35
ADRIANNE I do work on Saturday nights... (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
ED HAMANN Uh-hmm. 

00:21:40
ADRIANNE ...but it's only for like four hours and I do have the rest of the weekend to myself. (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
ED HAMANN Okay. 

00:21:45
ADRIANNE But that's only, oh, Friday is not really my week or count as weekends but I do have like all, most of Saturday and all of Sunday. (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
ED HAMANN Okay. 

00:21:50
ADRIANNE So like that's all I get... (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
ED HAMANN Uh-hmm. 

00:21:55
ADRIANNE ..and I go to church, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
ED HAMANN Yeah. 

00:21:55
ADRIANNE ...all that stuff and it's just. 

00:21:55
ED HAMANN Yeah. So you know time for yourself is really pretty serious isn't it? 

00:22:00
ADRIANNE Yeah. And Sunday is like family day. (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
ED HAMANN Yeah. 

00:22:05
ADRIANNE Basically. So... (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
ED HAMANN Not self day. (laughs) 

00:22:05
ADRIANNE Yeah. (laughs) 

00:22:05
ED HAMANN  Uh, okay. Well, help me so again what, what could you do that you, you could have a hand along the move from an eight to seven on that time for self scale. One... (crosstalk) 

00:22:20
ADRIANNE I... (crosstalk) 

00:22:20
ED HAMANN ...one notch on a positive direction. 

00:22:20
ADRIANNE I think one working too much. But for me it's necessary to go school so I can't obviously eliminate that but work is something I could take lighter hours, to have at least an hour early to after... (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
ED HAMANN Oh. 

00:22:35
ADRIANNE I could do that. And (inaudible ) homeworks where I can stay and I can do what I want 'coz I have my homework done in work... (crosstalk) 

00:22:41
ED HAMANN  Oh. Okay. 

00:22:45
ADRIANNE Or even as school I guess I can just really, really work on getting homework done too. 

00:22:45
ED HAMANN  So do more home at school did you say? 

00:22:50
ADRIANNE Uh hmm. 

00:22:50
ED HAMANN  Okay. Alright. Anything else so we'll have move from an eight to a seven on that scale? 

00:23:00
ADRIANNE  Uhm. Well, I mean just the drop thing. (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
ED HAMANN Okay. Okay. You really again kind of said that a few times over. That's heavy for you. Well, kinda have to pull this together here a little bit in terms of our time together (clears throat) but I really do hear the overwhelming sense of stress that you're feeling uhm, you wanna try to make some more decisions for yourself and feel like you buttheads with your parents a little bit and, and uh, you kinda boil that down to two things that you really wish uh, would be different would be to be able to make some of your own decisions and to be able to manage your time for yourself a little better. Is that sound accurate to you? 

00:23:50
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

00:23:50
ED HAMANN  And in the terms of the making your own decisions, uh, it seems like the one thing you thought might be uh, helpful with that uhm, would be to be a bit more open particularly with friends that you feel kind of reserved and so maybe if you talk up some more that you think might be helpful. Is that right? 

00:24:15
ADRIANNE (nodding) 

00:24:15
ED HAMANN Okay. (clears throat) And in terms of time for yourself you might look into maybe reducing your work load, uh, maybe an hour a week, and uh, try to get some more homework done at school. Is that, that's all right? Those are two things or three things you'd be willing to consider? 

00:24:35
ADRIANNE Uh hmm. (nodding) 

00:24:35
ED HAMANN Okay. Being more open, uh, reducing work by an hour a week and doing more homework at school. Okay. Can I ask you one more scaling question, okay? And this is another one to ten were ten is you are a 100 percent committed to working on those three things. You're, you're gonna leave our conversation today and absolutely gonna do those three things and one is, you know, it ain't never gonna happen. Where would you put yourself on that scale of one to ten? 

00:25:05
ADRIANNE Uhm, maybe I'll get five I think. (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
ED HAMANN Okay. (laughs) 

00:25:10
ADRIANNE I, I will try to open up more. 

00:25:10
ED HAMANN Okay. (laughs) 

00:25:10
ADRIANNE  More, when I notice it 'coz it's really kinda hard for me to notice. There was no one to talk to or whatever. So that's for me kinda difficult but I think it's possible. 

00:25:20
ED HAMANN Okay. 

00:25:20
ADRIANNE  Uhm, working (laughs), working less? That may be a problem. Just for now. (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
ED HAMANN Alright. 

00:25:25
ADRIANNE And eventually, eventually I would like to, that's why I, I (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:25:32
ED HAMANN Uh-huh. 

00:25:32
ADRIANNE But uhm, just for now maybe I'll try to open up to, think first. (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
ED HAMANN Okay. And the homework at school? 

00:25:40
ADRIANNE I'll try to do that already. (laughs) I guess I could try harder but... (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
ED HAMANN Okay. 

00:25:45
ADRIANNE ...uhm, that would be a for sure, I think. (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
ED HAMANN Uh hmm. That would be a pressure thing. (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

00:25:50
ED HAMANN Okay. So, you're gonna, you're definitely gonna talk more to your friends uhm, gonna do more work at school, uhm, and then uh, see how that goes. (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

00:26:00
ED HAMANN Okay. Anything else you wanna add before we stop today? 

00:26:05
ADRIANNE No. 

00:26:05
ED HAMANN  Well, I appreciate you talking with me Adrianne. It's been very nice. Thank you. 

00:26:10
ADRIANNE I appreciate it too. Thanks. 

00:26:15
Comments 

00:26:15
ED HAMANN  Well, I certainly enjoyed uh, the opportunity to talk with Adrianne. Uhm, I feel sympathetic to the pressures that she's feeling uh, this time in her life, uh, junior in high school has a lot going on. She sounds like a very active and involved uh, young lady whose parents uh, seems to be very concerned about her and I, I think she understands that. Uhm, in terms of, of the approach I think that uh, Adrianne seem to uh, kind of be uh, interested in the miracle question, she smiled when I ask her about that and I thought to came up with uh, a number of specific things that would demonstrate the miracle. I thought the problem was that many of the miracle steps involved other people so uh, I hope that you notice that I tried to focus it to more things that she could do herself. Although again, this I think seemed to be fairly difficult for her to be able to uh, to come to terms with. Uhm, I did not ask the exception finding question uhm, not sure if I can tell you why I didn't do that exactly but I did move on to trying to do some scaling questions primarily the problem severity question in which we isolated the two areas that she sort of felt she had some control over of those being making decisions and uh, finding time for herself. So in terms of the problem severity question she identified a number on the scale and I asked her some things that she could do specifically to move one notch into more positive or solution uh, uh, direction and she was able to come up with uh, actually three activities that she could uh, felt that she could put into play uhm, being more open with her friends, trying to reduce her work load and doing more homework at school and so then hopefully we're able t notice I concluded with the uh, commitment scaling question uh, in terms of how committed Adrianne felt she was to working on those three things and she put herself at a five which again I think was probably a realistic answer for her. I think that her ability to carry this out is uh, probably a 50-50 proposition although she did say she certainly was going to be uh, more willing to be open to her friends and uh, and to see how that went. So uh, it was enjoyable talking with Adrianne.

Reality Therapy With Dr. Bill McFarland Introduction to Reality Therapy 

00:29:10
BILL MCFARLAND  Hi, my name is Dr. Bill McFarland. I'm a professor of Counselor Education and uh, I will be doing a demonstration uh, of Reality Therapy with a client and before the demonstration I would like to explain some of the key concepts of, of uh, Reality Therapy. Reality therapy is also been referred to as control theory, uh, also as choice theory, and more recently as the new reality therapy. It was developed by William Glasser and Robert Wubbolding has also written extensively about Reality Therapy. One of the first concepts I'd like to talk about is the concept of choice. According to reality therapy, behavior is seen as adjustments that we make when there is a discrepancy between a desired state where we want to be and our present condition. For example, we all have a desired state in terms of a comfortable temperature. If we are to stay in that desired state, we adjust our clothing. That is we would put on a sweater when we go out, and then we would choose to remove it when we are inside. Likewise, in the psychological area, the process of self-regulation involves setting desired states for ourselves. In other words clarifying what we want, observing our actions, that is working at what we are doing and then evaluating our actions by comparing their outcomes with the desired state. In other words are we getting what we want from our behaviors. Under this theory, now adapted behavior comes from flaws in this attempts to match the present state with the desired state. And problems arise from people due to several things. For example, a person may not know what actions to take to get to the desired state or if the person has continually failed to get what his desired, they may not exert enough effort because they expect only failure. Or they may have developed faulty ideas about what will get them from the present to the desired state. For example, throwing lavish parties probably will not get you a circle of devoted friends and of course desired states change and external unexpected things happen resulting in getting people of tract. Glasser claims we are all born with a universal set of needs which are survival, the need for love and belonging, the need for power or achievement, the need for freedom or independence and the need for fun. All behavior is an attempt to satisfy these needs. Now all people according to Glasser had the same needs but they do vary in strength. For example, achievement maybe more important than fun for one person but for another one fun maybe more important than achievement. It's interesting uh, that Glasser points out the need for love, and belonging is considered the primary need and it is the most difficult to fulfill simply because we must have a cooperative person to help us meet that need. Therefore, the focus of counseling is usually but not always on an unsatisfying relationship or the lack of a relationship. So according to reality therapy, everything we do is chosen, and every behavior is our best attempt to get what we want to satisfy our needs. Now, when I talk about total behavior I am including various components under that label. It includes the way we act, the way we think, the way we feel, and then our physiological reactions to situations. So once again the emphasis of this theory is on individual choice and individual responsibility. The goal of counseling therefore is to help people make better choices and have more control in their lives given the constraints of the outside world. Another set of concepts that I want to briefly highlight are the key procedures that are used in this counseling approach. And the procedures are represented by the letters WDEP. The W stands for wants. The counselor uses questions to help the client identify and understand their wants. What does this person want from herself or from her family or from her work, or from her teachers uh, what does this person in fact want from the counselor. The D stands for direction and doing. The focus here is on, is uh, on exploring present behavior and where that is taking the client. What did the client so last week, yesterday, or today to move towards satisfying the wants. The E stands for evaluation. The goal is having clients reflect upon the question does you present behavior have a reasonable chance of getting you what you want. I would work with the client to have her consider if her current behavior is in her best interest. I might ask the client if no changes are how satisfied is she likely to feel next week, next year, for the rest of her lives. In fact this is the core of this approach having clients evaluate their own behavior. The P stands for planning and action. Here clients are helped to developed a plan of action for change that is simple, that is attainable, that is measurable, that is immediate and that is controlled by the client, the client is committed to the plan and the client is continuously involved in executing the plan. I like Reality Therapy because it is a relatively short-termed therapy. I like it's emphasis on the client's self-evaluation. People are not viewed as being helpless but are seen as doing the best they can, making the best choices they can at the moment. Once clients decide for themselves that their choices are not helping them get what they want, they are much more likely to consider making changes.

Simulated Demonstration 

00:37:35
BILL MCFARLAND  Hello, good afternoon Adrianne. Uh, my name is uhm, Bill McFarland and we're gonna have about haft an hour uh, to talk about uhm, any of your concerns and so I was just wondering uh, what uhm, what would you like to talk about today? 

00:37:50
ADRIANNE  Well, I wanna talk about lately I'm just really overwhelmed that everything that's been going on. I don't really have a lot of time for myself and it's just in general not really allowed to let, or make my own decision. (crosstalk) 

00:38:05
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:38:05
ADRIANNE  Uhm, it's just really overwhelming and there's nothing that I can really do about that. I kinda feel trapped. 

00:38:15
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
ADRIANNE Uh hmm. 

00:38:15
BILL MCFARLAND So overwhelmed in the sense that uhm, you don't have a control over some decisions that were being made for you by the people it sounds like that. 

00:38:25
ADRIANNE Yeah, definitely. My parents play a big, play a big part in that. (crosstalk) 

00:38:25
BILL MCFARLAND  Oh. So your parents are uhm, making some decisions for you and it sounds that so you're not please with it. 

00:38:35
ADRIANNE Well, some of them. It just depends. (crosstalk) 

00:38:40
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:38:40
ADRIANNE Some of them I don't really mind, I don't really care. (crosstalk) 

00:38:40
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:38:40
ADRIANNE Whatever. Let them take the wheel I guess... (crosstalk) 

00:38:40
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:38:40
ADRIANNE  but uhm, others it's just you know I'm getting old enough to where I should be able to... (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
BILL MCFARLAND  Uh hmm. 

00:38:50
ADRIANNE ...and I know I should be able to but sometimes like I can't really say much anything about. (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:38:55
ADRIANNE When I try to fight it (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:38:55
ADRIANNE It's just a lost cause. (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
BILL MCFARLAND Oh. So uh, sometimes it's okay when they're making decisions for you but on the other hand you're feeling a little bit more mature in believing (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

00:39:05
BILL MCFARLAND ...in believing then that you ought to have some say in some things. 

00:39:10
ADRIANNE Yeah. I mean I've, I do believe I'm mature for my age. (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
BILL MCFARLAND Uh huh. 

00:39:10
ADRIANNE Definitely. Uhm, but there are just, just because lately I've been facing decisions that have really (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
BILL MCFARLAND Hmm. 

00:39:20
ADRIANNE Not really that of my age, that are a little bit older but it's just, it's getting really hard 'coz only with that I don't have time for myself and I work all the time. It's just in school, like on top of that and I think, I literally get up, go to school, come home, work, (crosstalk) 

00:39:35
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:39:35
ADRIANNE  And then I come home again, and then if I have homework I'll do that and then I go to bed. (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
ADRIANNE If that's a routine and I'm not a routine person at all. (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
ADRIANNE So everything is pretty structured and rigid? 

00:39:50
ADRIANNE Yeah. Not a fun. (laughs) 

00:39:50
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. Uh, you'd said that uh, there are some areas that you are unhappy with in terms of uh, what your parents are deciding. Could you uh, say a little bit more about uh, what those are? 

00:40:00
ADRIANNE Well, they're really strict. I come from a Christian family and... (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:40:05
ADRIANNE ...and just, they're really strict about like piercings or anything and I don't have any piercings personally but I mean even I always wanted my (inaudible ) at the top of your ear... (crosstalk) 

00:40:17
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:40:17
ADRIANNE ...and, and just it's something that I would like to do. You know, it's kinda like a real ease, at least something that I could do for myself that is little rebellious, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:40:25
ADRIANNE But I mean, I'm not allowed to that. (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:40:30
ADRIANNE I, I can't be rebellious at all. It's all structured, (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:40:30
ADRIANNE It's all disciplined and it's just really difficult 'coz I need that release. I, I mean, I'm still a teenager. (crosstalk) 

00:40:40
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:40:40
ADRIANNE I think I do need and... (crosstalk) 

00:40:40
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:40:40
ADRIANNE ...I'm not, I don't party. I don't do that stuff but at the same time I can't understand why some kid do. (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:40:45
ADRIANNE And I'm really, really feeling that way. (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. So the relationship then with your parents sounds huh, it's like you're boxed in a little bit. (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
ADRIANNE A little that. A little trapped. (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
BILL MCFARLAND A little bit trapped. Uhm, and uhm, you would like to feel a little more room within that relationship and... (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

00:41:05
BILL MCFARLAND ...uhm, to be your word a little, a little bit rebellious. (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
ADRIANNE Yeah. And like, we don't have a really big house so I mean we, there's not a lot you can really talked about under the roof... (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:41:15
ADRIANNE ...that won't be heard by others. (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:41:15
ADRIANNE Or have potentially or potentially heard. (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:41:15
ADRIANNE  It's just, I can't talk in the phone about some things therefore I can't like talk to anybody about how I feel. I can't tell them my secrets or like talk to my friends (crosstalk) 

00:41:25
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:41:25
ADRIANNE Or whatever. (crosstalk) 

00:41:30
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:41:30
ADRIANNE So I basically lately just not have been talking to my friends at all. (crosstalk) 

00:41:30
BILL MCFARLAND Oh. 

00:41:30
ADRIANNE Because it's just, I'll, I'll talk to them at school occasionally... (crosstalk) 

00:41:35
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:41:35
ADRIANNE ...but I'm more reserved... (crosstalk) 

00:41:35
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:41:35
ADRIANNE ...because just by being overwhelmed I feel like if I talk to them or I get caught in their drama or anything it's just something else I have to deal with. (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:41:45
ADRIANNE Because it's difficult. 

00:41:45
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm, uh hmm. So in other words it's so boxed in you really can't be yourself. 

00:41:50
ADRIANNE Yeah, I guess in other words. (laughs) 

00:41:55
BILL MCFARLAND You can't be yourself. Okay. Uhm, what have you tried up to this point uhm, to try to change this situation with your parents where you have uh, a little more space? 

00:42:10
ADRIANNE I've, I've been trying... (crosstalk) 

00:42:10
BILL MCFARLAND Hmm. 

00:42:10
ADRIANNE  like, they didn't like somebody I dated. (crosstalk) 

00:42:15
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:42:15
ADRIANNE So, I kinda fought with them about that but in the end what can you do? (crosstalk) 

00:42:20
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:42:20
ADRIANNE Like they've just take away stuff with all discipline and structure and just, I'm not allowed or able to even make that decision or... (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:42:30
ADRIANNE ...who I wanna be with, who I wanna date. (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:42:30
ADRIANNE I mean to, to date. I didn't like him and it turns out I can't date him. (laughs) I'm like what, what do you tell the person, you know. Well, my parents don't like you? (laughs) Okay, how old are you? (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
BILL MCFARLAND Oh. 

00:42:40
ADRIANNE It's just, it's just kinda like that. And it's a, it's a little embarrassing. (crosstalk) 

00:42:45
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:42:45
ADRIANNE So lately I just don't date. And I don't bring anybody home. If I do hang out with them, I mean... (crosstalk) 

00:42:50
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:42:50
ADRIANNE ...I don't, I don't feel necessary to tell them (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:42:55
ADRIANNE 'Cause they just get mad or... (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. 

00:42:55

00:43:55
BILL MCFARLAND Hmm. 

00:43:55
ADRIANNE ...of that stuff and it's not based on that person. (crosstalk) 

00:43:55
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:43:55
ADRIANNE And I keep trying to say to them that they're just being so close-minded and they don't like everything. (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:44:00
ADRIANNE It's not... (crosstalk) 

00:44:00

ADRIANNE I mean... (crosstalk) 

00:44:05

00:44:10
BILL MCFARLAND Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:44:10
ADRIANNE ...moving out or graduating and that I can't do this for another year.

00:44:15
ADRIANNE I'm... (crosstalk) 

00:44:15
BILL MCFARLAND  Yeah, how realistic is the idea of moving out. (laughs) 

00:44:20
ADRIANNE It's getting there. (laughs) And it's getting really realistic. I mean money is an issue at this point. (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:44:25
ADRIANNE It's obviously could happen... (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:44:25
ADRIANNE  for any reason... (crosstalk) 

00:44:30
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:44:30
ADRIANNE ...you know, uhm, I really wish they would (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:44:35
ADRIANNE Like I'm getting to that point (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah. 

00:44:35
ADRIANNE ...that when I'm 8, I'm 18, (crosstalk) 

00:44:40

ADRIANNE ...I will be at of high school yet but uh, (crosstalk) 

00:44:40
BILL MCFARLAND Sure, sure. 

00:44:40
ADRIANNE I mean, I have to wait to that point so that therefore (crosstalk) 

00:44:45
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:44:45
ADRIANNE It still for long. 

00:44:45
BILL MCFARLAND  So (sigh) again, I think what I'm hearing you're saying is that again you would, you would like the, uhm, a little more freedom. Uh, you wanna be treated little bit more maturely? (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
ADRIANNE Uh hmm. 

00:44:55
BILL MCFARLAND  Uhm, have a little more say over some things. Uhm, in the way you've try to go about that so far is uhm, arguing, (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

00:45:10
BILL MCFARLAND ...fighting, or maybe trying to ignore, ignore things or avoiding, avoiding things. If, if that's what you continue to do what do you think it's gonna be like in three or four, five or six months (inaudible )? 

00:45:24
ADRIANNE  Uhm, I must say it would be a lot better once I move out. (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. 

00:45:25
ADRIANNE But I mean but since I have another year and a half... (crosstalk) 

00:45:30
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:45:30
ADRIANNE ...I think things are gonna progress 'coz they're not letting go (crosstalk) 

00:45:35
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:45:35
ADRIANNE 'Coz they're not, they don't understand like they are not preparing me... (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:45:40
ADRIANNE ...when I get older by protecting me all the time like I have to be able to alive to make my own mistakes... (crosstalk) 

00:45:45
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. 

00:45:45
ADRIANNE  and sometimes I feel like they're being close-minded (crosstalk) 

00:45:50
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:45:50
ADRIANNE And that's why it's not working... (crosstalk) 

00:45:50
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:45:50
ADRIANNE ...'coz they are... (crosstalk) 

00:45:50
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:45:50
ADRIANNE  They don't realize that I am older now... (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
BILL MCFARLAND Hmm. 

00:45:55
ADRIANNE And it was okay when I was younger and it's not okay now. (crosstalk) 

00:46:00
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:46:00
ADRIANNE 'Coz they're not gonna be the one's standing beside me picking out of line(ph) of who I'm gonna marry based on their background... (crosstalk) 

00:46:05
BILL MCFARLAND Hmm. 

00:46:05
ADRIANNE  Like... (crosstalk) 

00:46:10
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. Sure you see these big decisions that you're gonna have to make for yourself. (crosstalk) 

00:46:10
ADRIANNE Yeah, definitely. 

00:46:10
BILL MCFARLAND And you're wondering how well prepared you're gonna be to do that because so many decisions (inaudible ) for you. (crosstalk) 

00:46:19
ADRIANNE  Yeah. And I, I just don't wanna include them on my decisions... (crosstalk) 

00:46:20
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:46:20
ADRIANNE ...and that, that's just what it's gonna have to be 'coz I can't be open with them as much as I, most kids can be. 

00:46:25
BILL MCFARLAND Sure, sure. 

00:46:30
[sil.] 

00:46:30
BILL MCFARLAND  So (sigh) uhm, if things, if things don't change then uhm, you know, if, if, if they don't begin to loosen things up a little bit. Uhm, you gonna continue to think about moving out whether it's a possibility or not. (crosstalk) 

00:46:50
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

00:46:50
BILL MCFARLAND You're gonna (coughs) continue to worry about uhm, how you're gonna be able to make those decisions for them to work. 

00:46:55
ADRIANNE  Yeah. And, I just, I feel like moving out would be great (crosstalk) 

00:47:05
BILL MCFARLAND Hmm. 

00:47:05
ADRIANNE 'Coz I mean I have an older brother (crosstalk) 

00:47:05
BILL MCFARLAND Uh-huh. 

00:47:05
ADRIANNE And he moved out uhm, he always talks about how much better his relation is with mom and dad (crosstalk) 

00:47:10
BILL MCFARLAND Hmm, yeah. 

00:47:10
ADRIANNE and about that stuff because... (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah. 

00:47:15
ADRIANNE ...he, the less they know, the better. 

00:47:15
BILL MCFARLAND Sure, sure. 

00:47:15
ADRIANNE And living with them, that's not really possible, (laughs) you know. 

00:47:20
BILL MCFARLAND What you're saying moving out presents some serious uh, obstacles too. 

00:47:25
ADRIANNE Yeah, it's, it's obstacles in just many ways, (crosstalk) 

00:47:25
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah. 

00:47:25
ADRIANNE You know, but I mean in the end I think it's better 'cause I'm not doing it to get away from yeah, a little bit I mean it's not... (crosstalk) 

00:47:35
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:47:35
ADRIANNE ...to get back at them... (crosstalk) 

00:47:35
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:47:35
ADRIANNE Or to cause this huge fight, it's more sort of help. 

00:47:40
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:47:40
ADRIANNE And that's really. 

00:47:40
BILL MCFARLAND  Let me ask you something that might sound a little funny but suppose uh, your parents were here right now and I would ask them what they would need to see from you that would tell them that you're mature enough to start making some of these decisions. What would they tell me? 

00:48:00
ADRIANNE Well, since I uhm, the guy I dated, or what dating... (crosstalk) 

00:48:05
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:48:05
ADRIANNE Uhm, they would tell me that since I did hang out with him a few times without them knowing or they found out later that they need to see more responsibility but I really don't know how to show them that because I work all the time. (crosstalk) 

00:48:20
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. 

00:48:20
ADRIANNE I go to school and I get my homework done and then go to bed like there's no room to show them that. 

00:48:25
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. So they would say we wanna see her act more responsively, that's what they would say. 

00:48:30
ADRIANNE And choose more responsible people, I guess. (laughs) 

00:48:30
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. And if I were to ask that, not you but if I were to ask them what would that look like? What would they see you doing differently? What would they tell us? 

00:48:40
ADRIANNE  Uhm, I, I couldn't tell you (laughs) like... (crosstalk) 

00:48:45
BILL MCFARLAND Hard to get inside their head. (laughs) 

00:48:45
ADRIANNE You know I try to and try to know where they're coming from...(crosstalk) 

00:48:45
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:48:45
ADRIANNE ...but sometimes it's just really hard 'coz I know my side (crosstalk) 

00:49:00
BILL MCFARLAND Sure, sure 

00:49:00
ADRIANNE And they side just seems so close-minded... (crosstalk) 

00:49:00
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:49:00
ADRIANNE ...and they don't realize that for the future it's not helping me. 

00:49:05
BILL MCFARLAND Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:49:05
ADRIANNE And that I think when I really when I go to college like I'm not, they could always do worst(ph). I can be some drugged out kid, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:49:10
BILL MCFARLAND Uh (laughs). 

00:49:10
ADRIANNE Like something awful but... (crosstalk)(laughs) 

00:49:15
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:49:15
ADRIANNE I'm not. (crosstalk) 

00:49:15
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:49:15
ADRIANNE And a simply ear piercing is unacceptable. (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:49:20
ADRIANNE And it's just, it's ridiculous. (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:49:20
ADRIANNE And it's (inaudible ) that they're strict. (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm, sure. Sure. So they would say uh, we need to her acting more responsible. That's what they would say. 

00:49:35
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

00:49:35
BILL MCFARLAND And then they would say by that we mean we would like to see what do you think they would see? 

00:49:40
ADRIANNE More honesty like when I did hang out with him... (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:49:45
ADRIANNE ...without them knowing whatever they didn't like it. (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. 

00:49:45
ADRIANNE I think maybe that's upset them kinda like (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
BILL MCFARLAND Oh. 

00:49:50
ADRIANNE Made them lose trust... (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:49:50
ADRIANNE ...'coz... (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:49:50
ADRIANNE  You know... (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:49:55
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:49:55
ADRIANNE That I mean, it's just so uh, it's so frustrating... (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:50:00
ADRIANNE ...you know... (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:50:00
ADRIANNE ...and it's like uh, not only may not being able to make my own decision because of them... (crosstalk) 

00:50:05
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:50:05
ADRIANNE They're now getting mad at me because I'm trying to do so. (crosstalk) 

00:50:10
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:50:10
ADRIANNE It's just something as a person that I needed to do. (crosstalk) 

00:50:15
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. And it's interesting him, with, with what you come up with the idea of uh, demonstrating more honesty. (crosstalk) 

00:50:20
ADRIANNE Yeah. But when I, when I try to yell is they get mad (crosstalk) 

00:50:25
BILL MCFARLAND Uh. 

00:50:25
ADRIANNE So I mean there's not positive reinforcement and the honesty. (crosstalk) 

00:50:30
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:50:30
ADRIANNE So there's, the least they know the better, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:50:30
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:50:30
ADRIANNE And things were exactly were more better even so. (crosstalk) 

00:50:35
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:50:35
ADRIANNE So I don't know but I really don't know to make privacy. (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:50:40
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah. 

00:50:40
ADRIANNE And I try to be honest so that kinda, you know that kinda (crosstalk) 

00:50:45
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah. 

00:50:45
ADRIANNE Seclude the privacy (inaudible ) there. (crosstalk) 

00:50:48
BILL MCFARLAND What's, and it just makes me wonder what uhm, what's one area that might uh, try doing that if you haven't done that thing before. What's that? 

00:51:00
ADRIANNE I'm, I think that I would be happier if I just didn't choose people I like, people that I do. (crosstalk) 

00:51:05
BILL MCFARLAND Uhm. 

00:51:05
ADRIANNE Uhm, I do live in a small town so I obviously every school is gonna have it's problems (crosstalk) 

00:51:10
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:51:10
ADRIANNE And I'm friends with everybody. (crosstalk) 

00:51:15
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:51:15
ADRIANNE And they don't really like that. (laughs) 

00:51:15
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. Sure. 

00:51:15
ADRIANNE So uhm, I don't really know how to (crosstalk) 

00:51:20

ADRIANNE 'Coz I'm, think I know I'm a good person, I know I'm a good kid... (crosstalk) 

00:51:25

00:51:27
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. Sure. 

00:51:30
ADRIANNE And it's really hard. (clears throat) 

00:51:30
BILL MCFARLAND  You know, (clears throat) uhm, so some, sometimes you've try to be upfront in the past and that, that hasn't a necessary worked out well 

00:51:45
ADRIANNE No. 

00:51:45
BILL MCFARLAND So you're wondering if I tried to do it again... (crosstalk) 

00:51:45
ADRIANNE  Well... (crosstalk) 

00:51:50
BILL MCFARLAND Maybe you get the same kind of result. (crosstalk) 

00:51:50
ADRIANNE I have tried to do it again. (crosstalk) 

00:51:50
BILL MCFARLAND Oh. 

00:51:50
ADRIANNE And they were, and they accuse me like lying or sneaking around or (crosstalk) 

00:51:55

00:52:00
BILL MCFARLAND Hmm. 

00:52:00
ADRIANNE But I mean they've just completely lost trust 'coz I am a teenager that's typical teenager, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
BILL MCFARLAND  Yeah. 

00:52:10
ADRIANNE And, (laughs)... (crosstalk) 

00:52:10
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah. 

00:52:10
ADRIANNE It's just, I don't know how to show them that stuff when they aren't compromising (crosstalk) 

00:52:15
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:52:15
ADRIANNE Specially since I'm gonna be 18 (crosstalk) 

00:52:15
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:52:15
ADRIANNE  Relatively soon or quick to them (crosstalk) 

00:52:20
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:52:20
ADRIANNE ..sometime... (crosstalk) 

00:52:20
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:52:20
ADRIANNE ...and it's just, it's really. 

00:52:25
BILL MCFARLAND So if, if you would decide to have uhm, more of these honest conversations as you're, as you're talking about. What are, what are some uh, points that you like might try to make to them honestly? 

00:52:40
ADRIANNE Uh, points that I haven't tried or have?

00:52:50
BILL MCFARLAND Hmm. Hmm. 

00:52:50
ADRIANNE  I, I like things in the open 'coz I'm not really easily embarrassed of that but I mean there are times... (crosstalk) 

00:53:00
BILL MCFARLAND So... (crosstalk) 

00:53:00
ADRIANNE ...that I present stuff to my parents like I'll told them I'm going somewhere that they, they may not like but at least I'm telling them, you know, and it's just they let, like they just freak out (crosstalk) 

00:53:10
BILL MCFARLAND You don't tell them where you're going? 

00:53:10
ADRIANNE  Uh, sometimes. (laughs) 

00:53:15
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah. 

00:53:15
ADRIANNE I mean at the same time I only have weekends. (crosstalk) 

00:53:15
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:53:15
ADRIANNE  So it's not that often. (crosstalk) 

00:53:20
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:53:20
ADRIANNE But I mean even then like I always do the homework, no privacy, (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:53:25
ADRIANNE I just, I wanna go out and have fun. (crosstalk) 

00:53:30
BILL MCFARLAND Hmm. 

00:53:30
ADRIANNE And... (crosstalk) 

00:53:30
BILL MCFARLAND Now, I, you know what impresses me most is you explain this uh, to me, uh, Adrianne is that uhm, you know, you seem uh, accepting the fact that you're teenager and you understand therefore that your probably you're or some rules that have to be there. (crosstalk) 

00:53:45
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

00:53:45
BILL MCFARLAND Uhm, you see you're not dismissing the whole thing but again you're saying I need, I need space, I need some room to choose, I need uh, chances to act maturely and uh, uh, that shows me you, you really have I think uh, uh, a be real nice, balance sense or you're not thinking just black and white, good or bad. And that I think is a very uh, sound like pretty mature you I think. What, what do you think about that? 

00:54:15
ADRIANNE I think I wish my parents would say that. (laughs) I would love to hear it from my parents 'coz I, I do try to balance it. (crosstalk) 

00:54:25
BILL MCFARLAND Sure, sure. 

00:54:25
ADRIANNE I do try to know where they come from or where they're coming from but it's hard... (crosstalk) 

00:54:25
BILL MCFARLAND  And what if... (crosstalk) 

00:54:30
ADRIANNE ...'coz they don't, they don't try to talk to me about it and they're not open about it. (crosstalk) 

00:54:35
BILL MCFARLAND Sure, sure. And uhm, you know, uhm, you know, we, we can, we can uh, hear you and I can come up a way that's gonna make them different. (laughs) 

00:54:45
ADRIANNE Yeah, I know. (laughs) 

00:54:45
BILL MCFARLAND We can talk about some different things that you might try but we can't really make them to do it. But if you were to uhm, present this uh, story that you've shared with me. This balanced story uh, what might you say to them. 

00:55:00
ADRIANNE I, I really don't know but I'd say to them that I have already said... (crosstalk) 

00:55:05
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm.

00:55:10
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:55:10
ADRIANNE  and overwhelmed. 

00:55:15
BILL MCFARLAND You try to break out of the trap by doing something just a little bit different. 

00:55:20
ADRIANNE Yeah. (laughs) 

00:55:20
BILL MCFARLAND What, what might you say to them to let them know what it is that you want? 

00:55:25
ADRIANNE  Uhm, I want more freedom. (crosstalk) 

00:55:30
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. 

00:55:30
ADRIANNE I want them to accept more so than to criticize... (crosstalk) 

00:55:35
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. 

00:55:35
ADRIANNE ...or not want me to or not allow me to do someting. I want them... (crosstalk) 

00:55:40
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. 

00:55:40
ADRIANNE ...to just say, okay, you know what, it's your life. If you make mistake, I think you're making a mistake and they, they can present their opinions, like that's fine. 

00:55:45
BILL MCFARLAND  Okay. 

00:55:50
ADRIANNE If I'm making a mistake, then let me make the mistake. I have the opportunity to make that mistake. 

00:55:55
BILL MCFARLAND Correct. 

00:55:55
ADRIANNE And even if it is a mistake I don't really necessary think that me come and do my own thing of mistake... (crosstalk) 

00:56:00
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. 

00:56:00
ADRIANNE ...but it's like they are trying to leave off in their experiences. (crosstalk) 

00:56:05
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:56:05
ADRIANNE They want me to do so. (crosstalk) 

00:56:05
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:56:05
ADRIANNE If I have been through what they been through. (crosstalk) 

00:56:05
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:56:05
ADRIANNE  So I mean, it's just really hard... (crosstalk) 

00:56:10
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:56:10
ADRIANNE ...getting across to them, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:56:15
BILL MCFARLAND Okay, sure. Oh sure, it sure like. But part of it then is saying to them uhm, something like uhm, I wanna make, start making some decisions for myself. I understand your opinions. I think these are things that you told them. I understand your opinions. I understand that we, there needs to be some roles 'coz I'm just a teenager. (laughs) 

00:56:35
ADRIANNE At the same time like I just, I just wanna get out, I just wanna move out. 

00:56:40

00:56:45
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. Uh hmm.

00:56:45
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:56:45
ADRIANNE ...you know all teenagers want but at this point it'll(ph) not possible. 

00:56:50
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. Uh, let me ask you another thing is gonna settle with you probably. Let's supposed I was your parent, which ever one, (laughs) and you wanted to make those points that you just, that you just mentioned, what would you say to me? 

00:57:00
ADRIANNE  I would say, I wish that you would uh, I wish that you would let me do my own thing, be myself... (crosstalk) 

00:57:15
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:57:15
ADRIANNE ...and make my own decisions and mistakes. 

00:57:15
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:57:15
ADRIANNE  If, if they are mistakes, you know. 

00:57:20
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:57:20
ADRIANNE But. 

00:57:20
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. And but, but were, but were still responsible for you. We've gotta have some kind of, some kind of rules for you. 

00:57:30
ADRIANNE When I'm 18, well, I'll tell them like when I'm 18, I'm responsible for myself. 

00:57:35
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah. 

00:57:35
ADRIANNE And I'm so close to that, but I don't have any experience. 

00:57:40
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:57:40
ADRIANNE Not doing so and I wanna learn from my own. 

00:57:45
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. So, what's one, one thing, what's one change that you would like to see us make? 

00:57:50
ADRIANNE No dating rules. I mean, unless they're absolutely awful. (laughs) But I'd hope you would spare me but I just, I don't think that you have a say and do I like 'coz that is my own opinion, my own feelings... (crosstalk) 

00:58:05
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:58:05
ADRIANNE  something I can't hold. 

00:58:10
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. 

00:58:10
ADRIANNE And if I wanna explore it then... (crosstalk) 

00:58:10
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. How, how realistic... (crosstalk) 

00:58:15
ADRIANNE Hmm. 

00:58:15
BILL MCFARLAND ...do you think that request is. You know it better than I do. (crosstalk) 

00:58:15
ADRIANNE Oh. 

00:58:15
BILL MCFARLAND You know it better than I do. (crosstalk) 

00:58:15
ADRIANNE I've tried that request. 

00:58:20
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah. 

00:58:20
ADRIANNE But. (crosstalk) 

00:58:20
BILL MCFARLAND They haven't work? 

00:58:20
ADRIANNE It has it but you know what, there's nothing, I mean, 'coz I am so close to being 18, there is nothing that they can really do about it so I like, I guess like, I could just keep doing what I'm doing, I don't wanna ruin anything with them. 

00:58:35
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:58:35
ADRIANNE Like I don't wanna lose my family. 

00:58:35
BILL MCFARLAND  Oh. 

00:58:40
ADRIANNE Over the next year and a half and I could just move out... (crosstalk) 

00:58:40
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. 

00:58:40
ADRIANNE ...and everything will be okay. (crosstalk) 

00:58:40
BILL MCFARLAND Sure, sure, sure. 

00:58:40
ADRIANNE  But. 

00:58:45
BILL MCFARLAND And that's, that seems to be the struggle on the other hand, how can I get some space without really, alienating everybody? 

00:58:50
ADRIANNE Uh hmm. 

00:58:50
BILL MCFARLAND And, and if you don't wanna lose your family. 

00:58:50
ADRIANNE Uh hmm. 

00:58:50
BILL MCFARLAND Okay? Uh, I think as a parent if I would hear that, that would make quite a, quite an impact on me. 

00:58:55
ADRIANNE  Yeah, I don't know. I, I really don't know how I say that to them. 

00:59:05
BILL MCFARLAND You just said it very clearly. 

00:59:05
ADRIANNE Yeah, but they have not, they all were more hardheaded. (laughs) 

00:59:10
BILL MCFARLAND Okay, yeah. Uh, of course parents I guess tend, tend and like tend to be that way. But I think uhm, again point is we, we can't make them change but you can, you can decide on how you, you present your honest uh, request to them. (crosstalk) 

00:59:30
ADRIANNE Uh hmm. 

00:59:30
BILL MCFARLAND And, and that something that you, you can control. 

00:59:30
ADRIANNE  Yeah. 

00:59:35
BILL MCFARLAND You, not them. 

00:59:35
ADRIANNE Yeah. I don't know, I just think in the end that if I keep, I wanna make that decisions that I'm going to whether they kinda like it or not. 

00:59:45
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:59:45
ADRIANNE And... (crosstalk) 

00:59:45
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

00:59:45
ADRIANNE ...I'm going to probably go against things they don't like. 

00:59:50
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. Sure. (crosstalk) 

00:59:50
ADRIANNE But in the end it's still gonna be my decision... (crosstalk) 

00:59:55
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:59:55
ADRIANNE ...me and not, (crosstalk) 

00:59:55
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

00:59:55
ADRIANNE them like, that'll be, that'll be considered, that will be included... (crosstalk) 

01:00:00
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. Sure. 

01:00:00
ADRIANNE ...on some things. (crosstalk) 

01:00:00
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

01:00:00
ADRIANNE But this, with the way they're acting... (crosstalk) 

01:00:00
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

01:00:00
ADRIANNE  they're really declining their chances on me... (crosstalk) 

01:00:05
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

01:00:05
ADRIANNE ...including them. 

01:00:05
BILL MCFARLAND Sure, sure. 

01:00:05
ADRIANNE  Uhm. (crosstalk) 

01:00:10
BILL MCFARLAND I'm just wondering if, if you were to go home after our session here uh, this afternoon and you were to uhm, sit down with your parents and, and instead of uhm, ignoring or fighting, instead of that uh, if you're were going to again uh, present just one honest revelation to them. Just one, just a moment maybe. What, what it might have been? 

01:00:40
ADRIANNE I wanna be able to tell them where I'm going without them being worried or mad. I wanna be, I wanna have that open, honest relationship... (crosstalk) 

01:00:50
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. 

01:00:50
ADRIANNE ...where they reinforced honesty rather than make, rather than presenting negatively about it. 

01:00:55
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. 

01:00:55
ADRIANNE Like uh, that's what I want. 

01:01:00
BILL MCFARLAND Okay. 

01:01:00
ADRIANNE and I want a mature relationship... (crosstalk) 

01:01:00
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

01:01:00
ADRIANNE ...where I make my own decisions... 

01:01:00
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

01:01:00
ADRIANNE  and if they don't like it, they kinda just sit back and watch. 

01:01:05
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah. 

01:01:05
ADRIANNE And if it's a bad one I'll learn from it, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:01:10
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

01:01:10
ADRIANNE There's nothing wrong with learning from things. (crosstalk) 

01:01:10
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. Uh hmm. And, and that is that, that is a new, a new way to, to go with this. Is that what you telling me? If you would say it that way. 

01:01:20
ADRIANNE Yeah, 'coz right now I'm just kinda taking it. 

01:01:20
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:01:20
ADRIANNE But I mean, I think, I don't know whose gonna help to hold me but... (crosstalk) 

01:01:25
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah. 

01:01:25
ADRIANNE ...I think maybe I need to... (crosstalk) 

01:01:25
BILL MCFARLAND Hmm. 

01:01:25
ADRIANNE ...be takin' more a little, a little more initiative... (crosstalk) 

01:01:30
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah. 

01:01:30
ADRIANNE ...on what I'm doing in my stresses. 

01:01:30
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah, Uh hmm. 

01:01:30
ADRIANNE And let me disrupt my home environment. 

01:01:35
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

01:01:35
ADRIANNE Or even... (crosstalk) 

01:01:35
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

01:01:35
ADRIANNE ...forever but in the end... 

01:01:40
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. Sure. 

01:01:40
ADRIANNE ...it'll be, I think it'll be better for me. 

01:01:40
BILL MCFARLAND How realistic you think it is to try to do that? 

01:01:45
ADRIANNE Realistic, uhm. (crosstalk) 

01:01:50
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah, I mean, you know, nothing's a hundred percent. 

01:01:50
ADRIANNE I'm still a little hesitant... (crosstalk) 

01:01:55
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

01:01:55
ADRIANNE ...about... (crosstalk) 

01:01:55
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. Sure. 

01:01:55
ADRIANNE ...the whole upsetting them... (crosstalk) 

01:01:55
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

01:01:55
ADRIANNE  'coz I still love my parents. 

01:02:00
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

01:02:00
ADRIANNE It's not worth it 'coz I'm gonna be out in a year and a half. (crosstalk) 

01:02:00
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. Sure. 

01:02:00
ADRIANNE So. 

01:02:00
BILL MCFARLAND  Oh, yeah, I mean, you know, I mean, I understand what you're saying. I don't wanna. (laughs) 

01:02:05
ADRIANNE And, but still, it's a year and a half. A year and a half... (crosstalk) 

01:02:10
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

01:02:10
ADRIANNE ...more that I have to deal with this, (crosstalk) 

01:02:10
BILL MCFARLAND Sure. 

01:02:10
ADRIANNE this feeling, this feeling trapped. 

01:02:15
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

01:02:15
ADRIANNE And I don't have to feel like this. And so. 

01:02:20
BILL MCFARLAND Hmm. Yeah, yeah, how to step out of the trap. 

01:02:20
ADRIANNE Yeah, and it's just, I'm, I'm busy, I'm overwhelmed, I'm stress out, 'coz I don't have time for myself en, enough as it is but I have to... (crosstalk) 

01:02:30
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

01:02:30
ADRIANNE ...come home to this. 

01:02:30
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:02:30
ADRIANNE And it's just, normally against(ph) what I do and I make my own decisions it's little hard. 

01:02:35
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Well, again uhm, you know, I, I am impressed with uhm, really how, how balanced your, your, your taking situation. It is uhm, you know, on the one hand, you wanna stay connected to your parents. You don't wanna alienate them. But on the other hand again, you would, you would like to see a little bit more space sort of step out of it, step, step out of the trap. And the other thing that impresses me is that you know, I think uhm, you're, you're, you're able to say uh, the fighting and the avoiding hasn't really worked in the past and I think you've got uhm, some ideas on uh, you know, some different things that you might, might try in the name of being honest and mature in what you present, what you present to your parents. Uh, a lot, a lot of uh, students that I talked to your age, uhm, can't, can't see things quite that way. Like(ph) my parents are bad, they're out to get me. I hate them but I'm not, that's not what I'm hearing from you. 

01:03:40
ADRIANNE That makes me feel a lot better, (laughs) 'coz because I always think about you know, I'm not being... (crosstalk) 

01:03:50
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

01:03:50
ADRIANNE ...unreasonable... 

01:03:50
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

01:03:50
ADRIANNE ...so much... (crosstalk) 

01:03:50
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

01:03:50
ADRIANNE ...'coz somebody my age like to... (crosstalk) 

01:03:55
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

01:03:55
ADRIANNE ...feel like some... (crosstalk) 

01:03:55
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

01:03:55
ADRIANNE ...people are like that. (crosstalk) 

01:03:55
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. Well, what uh, what you might do is think about uhm, uh, what is it that you might say to your parents that is honest and reasonable? 

01:04:05
ADRIANNE Hmm. 

01:04:05
BILL MCFARLAND That would demonstrate to them that uh, you are becoming more responsible. 

01:04:10
ADRIANNE Uh hmm. I want to make my own decisions... (crosstalk) 

01:04:15
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah. Hmm. 

01:04:15
ADRIANNE ...and I want to make, make my own mistakes... (crosstalk) 

01:04:15
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. Yeah. 

01:04:15
ADRIANNE ...let me learn from them. 

01:04:20
BILL MCFARLAND Yeah. Well, if, if I were, if we were to meet again maybe in a week, uh, that's what I might ask you to do this week was just think about it. What would be honest and reasonable things that you can request from your parents. (crosstalk) 

01:04:30
ADRIANNE Okay(ph). 

01:04:30
BILL MCFARLAND Don't need, don't do it now but (laughs) that might be the little homework this time... (crosstalk) 

01:04:35
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:04:35
BILL MCFARLAND ...that I would give you and then maybe we could talk a little bit more about that the next time specifically what are, what are some different strategies that you might try I guess, some of the things you tried in the past that haven't really gotten, gotten what you wanted. 

01:04:45
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:04:45
BILL MCFARLAND  Okay. Well thank you for uhm, coming in here (inaudible ) very much. 

01:04:55
ADRIANNE Thank you for helping me. 

01:04:55
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

01:04:55
Comments 

01:04:55
BILL MCFARLAND  I think the uh, session uh, that we just uh, completed was uhm, fairly typical for uhm, using a reality therapy approach and I found it interesting uh, as I said Glasser uh, talks about the need for love and belonging as being primary the need and I think uh, that is the need that was addressed most extensively in the session uh, Glasser also talks about uh, counseling usually being about relationships and I think uh, again the uh, session was a, a really good example uh, of the uhm, challenges that are present in uh, in relationships. We also had uh, to develop mental issues uh, of an adolescent striving for more autonomy uhm, so, trying to stay connected at the same time that she's trying to go through that normal uhm, separation and individuation uh, process, so I think we had some strong developmental things here as well. Uh, I think uh, we were able to touch on uh, the dubya(ph), the wants, uh, trying to re or, wanting to try redefine uh, the relationship or the connection she has with her parents. I think we were able to dialogue about the dee, the doing and the doing, the current behavior that is avoiding discussions or tripping in to argumentative dialogue uh, with her parents right away which really not taking her in her, in the direction that she was satisfied with and uh, I think I was able to help her evaluate that current behavior and then finally the uh, plan for change although not specific maybe as I would like it to be uh, I think uh, the plan were uh, she is going to think about coming up with more mature, reasonable and honest ways to communicate her needs to her parents. Uh, I think was uh, uh, a shift in, in, in behavior and again, uhm, I think the homework assignment if she was able to follow up on that would be uh, a really good place to start uh, uh, during the follow up uh, the follow up session. Uhm, I certainly enjoy the uh, my uh, my dialogue with her uhm, and I was uh, quite honest in my feedback to her uh, complimenting her on uh, really moving a, away from looking at this as a black and white issue uhm, good people and bad people to seeing it as much more complex and uhm, that is uh, uh, a cognitive process that a lot of adolescents struggle with but uh, Adrianne seems to uhm, uhm, be very resilient in, in, in that area, being able to view things, I think more maturely and more complexly than uh, probably a lot of her peers so, so, uh, I'd like to have another session with her but uh, that's probably not gonna happen. Thank you.

Cognitive Behavior With Dr. Carrie Alexander-Albritton Introduction to Cognitive Behavior Therapy 

01:08:00
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  Hi, my name is Dr. Carrie Alexander-Albritton and I'll be discussing cognitive behavioral theory. Before I begin, I wanted to credit Dr. Albert Ellis and uhm, Dr. Aaron Beck for being the founders of this theory. Cognitive Behavioral Theory is, has been molded in many ways, Albert Ellis was the founder of Rational Emotive Therapy which later turned into Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy and Aaron Beck was the founder of Cognitive Theory and the two merge are called Cognitive Behavioral Theory and so I'll be talking about that counseling theory today. The nature uhm, of humans through this theoretical lens is that people that the cognitive behavioral theory views people as controlling how they feel based on how they think and so this theory as, is insight focus allowing the client to recognize and then change negative thoughts they have about specific behaviors that might be seen as maladaptive. What people think about themselves and usually the world around them uhm, according to this theory direc, directly causes how they feel and how they behave as a result of that. The model of mental health through cognitive behavioral theory is that individuals based how they are feeling and what happens to them and they taken to account immediate thoughts and do not typically think things through. Individuals make errors and their thinking a lot of times which can bring about negative feelings and behaviors according to this theory. Emotional disturbance then through this theoretical lens is such that people allow their thoughts to determine their emotions and the meanings that they make or the meanings that they have that are associated with the events uhm, which determine their reactions. So people have a tendency then to make errors in their thinking which results uhm, in negative affects on people, on the people. So, the counseling process of cognitive behavioral theory is that uhm, steps counselors take to move the client from a state of emotional disturbance to a state of mental health so there are three main goals that I would like to point out as, that are basic tenets of cognitive behavior, behavioral theory and those are helping clients to identify their own maladaptive behaviors and their maladaptive beliefs that they have. Also, helping them to test and evaluate their beliefs and the third, helping them gain awareness of automatic thoughts and then change those that are maladaptive. The role of the counselor then is to put emphasis on the therapeutic relationship. A lot of people will say that the relationship isn't as important in cognitive behavioral theory and uhm, that can be, can be said sometimes, I think it depends on the characteristics of the counselor and how much emphasis they place on the relationship. The counselor needs to have a genuine, warm, accurate, empathy, non-judgmental attitude with the client at all times and uh, maintain an ability to uhm, establish trust and rapport with the client as well. Specific techniques that are used in this theory uhm, are among very many. On the cognitive side, uhm, we have things such as thought stopping uhm, and helping to identify catastrophic uhm, thoughts and so, that is said to be catastrophizing or identifying cognitive distortions and so helping the client to do that can be effective within this theory. Positive self statements are also some cognitive interventions that might be used, cognitive restructuring, empathetic or empathic therapeutic relationship, re-framing, role playing, modeling, having a sense of humor with your client uhm, at times homework and bibliotherapy can be used. The behavioral interventions that might be melded into this are reinforcements, positive and negative, extinction and shaping and maybe stimulus control as well are again some of the techniques that are use in cognitive behavioral theory. Overall, cognitive behavioral theory is based on the assumption that behavior is learned. Uhm, behavior maybe created and maintained by external events, that happen in our lives and re-enforces the individuals world or their own thoughts. Learning is said to be based on the individuals contextual environment and the way they understand the world. Again, cognitive behavioral theory is based on the assumption that behavior is learned.

01:13:45
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Okay. I heard you say a few powerful words, overwhelmed and stressed stood out to me when you first started talking. 

01:13:55
ADRIANNE Yeah, uhm, very stressed, very overwhelmed. I, I feel like I'm doing a lot... (crosstalk) 

01:14:05
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:14:05
ADRIANNE ...and just like not being able to make those decisions doesn't quite help out but I'm always working, I literally get up in the morning, go to school, go to work, come home, if I have homework I do it and then I go to bed. 

01:14:20
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Okay. 

01:14:20
ADRIANNE I don't have a lot of time to talk with my friends 'coz I don't have a privacy in my house 'coz it's kind of a smaller home you know, and it's just no, they can hear what you say and there's not a lot that I can keep to myself... (crosstalk) 

01:14:35
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Hmm. 

01:14:35
ADRIANNE ...I don't have a lot of privacy and I can't really talk to them about, about it especially(ph) in school but the problem in school is I'm started noticing I was more reserved and like when comment on things, I'm open in person, I'm very, like I always give my opinion and usually I felt like I'm so overwhelmed lately that I feel like I can't or like I'm not so much 'coz I haven't noticed it until recently. 

01:15:00
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Okay. So you've noticed some changes in yourself. 

01:15:00
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:15:00
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  And I heard you said that you have a lot of responsibility in you so you're transitioning from going to school in the morning and then throughout the day uhm, you have responsibilities as a student and then in the evening you, you might work. So there's none a lot of time there left for you. 

01:15:15
ADRIANNE Yeah. It's been a lot like that actually. 

01:15:20
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Okay. And so feeling like kind of torn between being still a student and living under parent, parental guidelines and then also wanting to be an adult and have kind of your own privacy and your own space. Is that... (crosstalk) 

01:15:30
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:15:30
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  accurate? 

01:15:35
ADRIANNE Definitely. My parents uh, they're not the only thing but they are really big part of it. (crosstalk) 

01:15:40
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Okay. 

01:15:40
ADRIANNE It's because it's really hard (sighs) like, I feel like they're too strict and they want to control my life based on the mistakes that they've made in the past. And really, I would like to make my own. And to make my own decision and to make my own mistakes, learn from it 'coz I'm getting to an age where I have to do that. 

01:15:55
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:15:55
ADRIANNE That is just, it's getting difficult to live and I still have a year and a half left... (crosstalk) 

01:16:00
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Okay. 

01:16:00
ADRIANNE ...that house 'coz I'm only a junior and (sighs) I don't know how much I can do that without fighting with them more. 

01:16:10
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Okay. And you don't wanna fight is what I'm hearing. You wanna be independent and be heard... (crosstalk) 

01:16:15
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:16:15
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON ...as an individual and not, and not fight. 

01:16:15
ADRIANNE Yeah, definitely. I'm, I really don't like the fighting but sometimes it's really necessary but we're not getting our points across to each other. They're not, though they say they're not getting through to me and I'm definitely not getting through to them 'coz I felt like they're more closed minded... (crosstalk) 

01:16:30
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:16:30
ADRIANNE  and it's just, it's really uh, (sighs) like I don't know what else to do. Uh, we fight, we're fighting more now about stuff and it's just, I don't know what else to do. I try to be honest with them and they just get mad or I try to be more open with them and tell them what I'm gonna do, but, but make my own decisions at the same time... (crosstalk) 

01:16:55
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:16:55
ADRIANNE ...and they just, they don't understand sometimes and they're not willing to compromise. 

01:17:00
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Okay. So again I hear that pattern of kind of being in this uhm, world where you wanna make your own decisions and yet having to abide by ro, rules as a student and rules as a daughter living in someone else's home that maybe you know, you don't have as much independence as you would like at this point. 

01:17:20
ADRIANNE Yeah. And uhm, just working all the time too. I'm really stressed out and I have no time for myself... (crosstalk) 

01:17:25
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Hmm. 

01:17:25
ADRIANNE ...and coming home to that, not being able to make mis, decisions for myself and having to work and make money 'coz that's really important at this point. (crosstalk) 

01:17:35
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:17:35
ADRIANNE  To go to college and stuff 'coz I'm really gonna pay for a little bit of it you know, not all of it so I'm trying to really... (crosstalk) 

01:17:45
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Right. 

01:17:45
ADRIANNE . . .established that as much as I can and, just really overwhelmed. 

01:17:50
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON It's sounds like you don't have a lot of time for you right now and as you're, as you're talking to me, whe, when I made a couple of comments about being overwhelmed and kind of being torn, you looked sad. You're, you're eyes kinda shifted and you looked down and you just, you looked sad as you talk right now. 

01:18:05
ADRIANNE Yeah, it's kinda, it's kinda hard... (crosstalk) 

01:18:05
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:18:05
ADRIANNE ...to deal with. I don't know I don't, I tried anything that's really bad when you see do, when you see a change in yourself. 

01:18:15
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Okay. Talk about a little bit more about the changes that you've seen in your self. You said that you haven't talked a lot at school. 

01:18:20
ADRIANNE  I'm always(ph) are, 'coz usually I'm really outspoken and I always give an opinion or I always laugh or joke and I don't, I don't know if everybody likes it or not. But I mean (sighs) it's something that I do usually and lately because I'm so overwhelmed. It's just like, I feel like if I talk to my friends and get caught in their problems or their drama, it's just something else I could deal with and I just, that's kinda how I put it, like that's how I reason it. (crosstalk) 

01:18:45
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:18:45
ADRIANNE  But, uh-uh. (crosstalk) 

01:18:50
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON So you're trying to surround yourself with positive people then. 

01:18:50
ADRIANNE I'm trying, yeah. (laughs) (crosstalk) 

01:18:50
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Okay. Okay, 'coz it sounds like you really want to be a positive. You said you don't wanna get caught up in your friends uhm, drama so to speak, right? So you wanna, you wanna maintain a positive uhm, a positive attitude. (crosstalk) 

01:19:05
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:19:05
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON So how, how else do you do that? 

01:19:05
ADRIANNE I (laughs) well, I mean I'm a very busy person and I, I like to be busy. Don't get me wrong but it's just, it's really difficult when I only have weekends myself so I work during the week. 

01:19:15
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  Uh hmm. 

01:19:20
ADRIANNE And then I work on Friday nights. It's usually not really included in the weekend but I work, I do work Saturday nights but I have only for a few hours and I have that whole beginning of the day 'coz I don't have school every second Saturdays. 

01:19:30
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Right. 

01:19:30
ADRIANNE And that's about the only time I have for myself and things I wanna do and my parents always have a say in it. And sometimes it's not what they want me to do or want me to go to or whatever. I'm not a bad kid. I never do stuff like ban. I never drink, I don't do it. (inaudible ) like I can really see why... (crosstalk) 

01:19:50
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:19:50
ADRIANNE ...ki, kids my age want 'coz it's just a release and even being strict, like getting a, ear piercing on top of my ear, I've always wanted to do that, always wanted to and they've just really strict (inaudible ) me and that is sort of a release... (crosstalk) 

01:20:06
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:20:06
ADRIANNE  kind of to be rebellious. 

01:20:10
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON You wanna be able to be yourself. 

01:20:10
ADRIANNE Yeah. I wanted to make decisions and, as, decisions as small as that is even something like I'm not allowed to make. 

01:20:15
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. You said a minute ago, you said, "I'm not a bad kid." And I wonder uhm, when you argue, you said you know, we, we fight and my parents restrict me from doing things and I wonder what you tell to yourself about yourself when you fight with your parents? 

01:20:30
ADRIANNE  I don't know. Sometimes I feel like they convinced me I am or I'm going to be. Or I'm going down the wrong path you know, and they've even said that before, some things I've done. And honestly I don't think I am. It's something that I wanna do for myself. I wanna, if it is a mistake you know what, they may, they could be right. If it is a mistake I'm still entitled to make that mistake for myself. (crosstalk) 

01:20:55
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. So on the one hand I hear you saying that you are a good person and you know that about yourself and you, and you, you are, you're a good kid as, uh, using your words. Now, on the other hand, when you argue with your parents and when they point things out to you, sometimes you feel like you aren't a good person. So there's kind of that incongruence there, is that right? 

01:21:10
ADRIANNE Yeah. It's just I'm tired of arguing with them because they're so close minded about some things. (crosstalk) 

01:21:20
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:21:20
ADRIANNE At the same time like I could see where they're coming from. (crosstalk) 

01:21:20
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:21:20
ADRIANNE It's just really hard (sighs) to accept that 'coz I only do ha, I do only have like a year and a half in that house. 

01:21:30
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Right. 

01:21:30
ADRIANNE It's not worth it at the same time like a year and a half? That's a lot. (crosstalk) 

01:21:35
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Your relationship with them is very important to you yet you're scared... (crosstalk) 

01:21:35
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:21:35
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON ...to stay there for that long. 

01:21:35
ADRIANNE Yeah. And I just think that if I didn't move out things will get better. I'm not, I'm not doing it to get back at them or anything but like I start, really starting to look into it because... (crosstalk) 

01:21:45
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Moving out? 

01:21:45
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:21:45
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Okay. 

01:21:45
ADRIANNE  because I kinda need that space and I think our relationship would be better. 

01:21:50
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:21:50
ADRIANNE  'Coz the less they know, the better. Sadly, that's sad to say but I don't know just because there's some of the things I've done and when I'm trying to be honest, I try to open up to them more and they've kinda just reinforce it with negativity. It's not helping at all and by them doing that, I'm not gonna include them in a lot of decisions that I'm gonna be making so it's really hard. (crosstalk) 

01:22:15
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Okay. So and again to bring that back to you, and there's again I hear you saying uhm, that you kinda tell yourself you're a bad person based on their reactions to things that you do and so it sounds like maybe a defense mechanism that you've come up with this. Well, I'm not, I'm gonna distance myself. I'm not gonna talk to them. I'm, I'm gonna kind of separate myself so they don't know what I do. Because when they say things to you, you tell yourself that you're not a good person. Is that, is that right? 

01:22:40
ADRIANNE Sometimes. 

01:22:40
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  Sometimes? 

01:22:45
ADRIANNE But I'm still fighting for the cause that I know is right. 

01:22:45
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Yeah. 

01:22:45
ADRIANNE So I mean I stick with them but at the same time they really make me question it. 

01:22:50
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Right. So what, what kinds of things do you do as an outlet to, to remind yourself that you're that good person that you said earlier in the session. 

01:23:00
ADRIANNE (sighs) Uhm, I guess keep myself busy. I work hard at school... (crosstalk) 

01:23:05
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:23:05
ADRIANNE ...or as hard as I can 'coz I am so busy so you know, homework is a lot more time consuming with a job on top of that. I, (sighs) I try like I'm always, I'm friends with everybody. I'm, really just stay out of things. I don't really, like I really never had any conflict except for with my parents... (crosstalk) 

01:23:25
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:23:25
ADRIANNE ...and it's just different coming home to that rather than at school when everything's okay but lately I've realized that I'm being more reserved... (crosstalk) 

01:23:35
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Okay. 

01:23:35
ADRIANNE ...which is also affecting my schoolwork too and... (crosstalk) 

01:23:40
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:23:40
ADRIANNE ...I don't know. It's just difficult. 

01:23:40
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON So it sounds like you really don't have an outlet for yourself or... (crosstalk) 

01:23:45
ADRIANNE No. 

01:23:45
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON ...a reminder or any way to remind yourself that you are the good person that you believe that you are deep down. 

01:23:50
ADRIANNE Yeah. I don't, I don't really have any privacy so much. And I don't have any time to myself really. So, I guess there's really no time to remind myself you know. 

01:24:00
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Sometimes an outlet uhm, for people when they're feeling really down or to remind themselves that they aren't a bad a person as you said is journaling. Is journaling something that you've ever tried? 

01:24:15
ADRIANNE Uhm, at school. Usually like she'll gives a topic and I totally just disregard it and (laughs) write about something that's bothering me or whatever and it does it help, it does help. In the end you feel like you've talked about it you know, but and always nobody has seen it. But... (crosstalk) 

01:24:25
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Hmm, so sometimes it helps for you to just release some of these things that are bottled up inside. 

01:24:30
ADRIANNE  Yeah. But it's, there's too much to write down (laughs) than I can work and think of you know. 

01:24:40
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON But sometimes that helps? 

01:24:40
ADRIANNE  Yeah, it does help. 

01:24:45
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Yeah. Well, maybe that's one thing that you could try between now and the next time we see each other again. Uhm, maybe to, to write down, give yourself sometime maybe when you get home from work to release some of those emotions. Maybe you don't write the whole story... (crosstalk) 

01:25:00
ADRIANNE Hmm. 

01:25:00
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON ...so to speak. Like you said there's too much to write down. Maybe you just write maybe what you're feeling that day or uhm thoughts that you have that are in your mind and maybe some positive statements that you told me earlier. You know I know deep down I'm a good person 'coz it sounds like you have to remind yourself of that. Yeah? 

01:25:15
ADRIANNE  Yeah. It's, sometimes it's not like a lot but I mean it does come up and uh, sometimes I always felt like I'm doing something wrong 'coz what else would my parents be so upset you know. 

01:25:30
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:25:30
ADRIANNE And I don't know how to make them happy without doing something that I have to do for myself. 

01:25:35
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. So it sounds like you put a lot of pressure on yourself to uhm, make others happy I think was your words. 

01:25:45
ADRIANNE Yeah, I guess. 

01:25:45
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  It's hard for you to have people upset with you? 

01:25:50
ADRIANNE It is but I, more so just want to be left alone. 

01:25:55
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Hmm. 

01:25:55
ADRIANNE Like if they wouldn't get upset or wouldn't try to guide me when I'm the one who should be like they, they've raised me. (crosstalk) 

01:26:05
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Hmm. 

01:26:05
ADRIANNE Then again they were great parents but I mean they shouldn't have to guide me when I was almost 18... (crosstalk) 

01:26:10
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:26:10
ADRIANNE  you know. It's just (sighs) I don't know what else to do. (sighs) Yeah. 

01:26:20
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  So again kind of going back to that uhm, transition like you're being, you're in this transition of they've raised me, I'm almost to that place where I can be independent but I'm not yet. Like I have a year and a half left to be at home. And being really overwhelmed in that role, it sounds like you do a lot of things. You're going to school and you're working and... (crosstalk) 

01:26:45
ADRIANNE Hmm. 

01:26:45
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON ...you come home like you said and you go to bed and then you do it again the next day. So there's not a whole lot of time for you. 

01:26:50
ADRIANNE Yeah, and I just, (sighs) I really don't, I don't know, like I said I just don't know what else to try, I don't know what else to do without, 'coz I mean as a teenager there is a point when parents just need to kind of let go a little bit. Like I'm, I'm still to that point where rules have to be there you know. 

01:27:10
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:27:10
ADRIANNE  But they have to let go some and let me do my own thing 'coz when I am out of the house what am I gonna do? I don't know how to do anything. So... (crosstalk) 

01:27:20
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. So you're scared? 

01:27:20
ADRIANNE  I'm scared but at the same time it's just, it's that feeling that I have to do this for myself. 

01:27:25
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  Uh hmm. 

01:27:30
ADRIANNE For the future you know. I have to be able to make decisions for myself whether it be to date somebody I want or whatever and it's just, or even the ear piercing I guess. (crosstalk) 

01:27:40
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:27:40
ADRIANNE (laughs) Like that's as small as that. It's just something I can do for myself that could affect me negatively or positively later. 

01:27:45
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  Uh hmm. You're worried that it might have an impact on you later. Or your relationship maybe? 

01:27:55
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:27:55
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Yeah. 

01:27:55
ADRIANNE Definitely. I don't, I don't want anything to go down the drain pretty much... (crosstalk) 

01:27:55
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  your relationship. 

01:28:00
ADRIANNE ...just, just because we fight about stuff that I do. (crosstalk) 

01:28:00
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Sure. 

01:28:00
ADRIANNE But it's stuff I have to, to do. (crosstalk) 

01:28:05
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Hmm. So it sounds like you think you're relationship with your parents is very important to you. 

01:28:05
ADRIANNE  It is very important. (crosstalk) 

01:28:10
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Hmm. 

01:28:10
ADRIANNE It's very important. I just, I'm trying to maintain that balance and it's not there. (crosstalk) 

01:28:15
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON So be yourself kind of this struggle for independence and yet maintain a relationship that you're scared you could damage. 

01:28:20
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:28:20
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Yeah. Yeah. And on top of that then trying to uhm, be who you wanna be. And emerge into this person that your trying to emerge into between this transition of adolescence to adulthood so to speak. Right? 

01:28:35
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:28:35
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  'Coz you are, you're still in high school? 

01:28:40
ADRIANNE Uh hmm. 

01:28:40
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Yeah. 

01:28:40
ADRIANNE I'm still in high school and like people my age like my friends my age don't really, like some of them do that like some of them have this problems and everything but it's not like I don't know what they're going through... (crosstalk) 

01:28:55
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:28:55
ADRIANNE ...about all that stuff. I mean. 

01:28:55
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON I know. 

01:28:55
ADRIANNE  It's just, it's different. I can't really relate this to anything else that I, my friends have. (inaudible ) like I don't talk to them lately. Lately and that's something I really wanna work on 'coz that's, I can't look, I don't know. I'm just surprised that I didn't noticed it or started doing it in the first place. (crosstalk) 

01:29:15
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:29:15
ADRIANNE I just feel like I'm losing a part of myself but it's something that I have to do and it's just, it's bothering me. Like my parents are trying to do something for me that isn't working. 

01:29:20
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  Do something for you? 

01:29:25
ADRIANNE They're trying to guide me. They are trying to lead me of, based of their own mistakes and I wanna be able to make my own. So it's... (crosstalk) 

01:29:35
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Even if they are mistakes? You wanna be able to do that on your own and say this is something that I decided to do versus... (crosstalk) 

01:29:40
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:29:40
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON ...something that I was told to do. Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:29:40
ADRIANNE  Yeah. Definitely. I hope, I don't know how to reach them 'coz I felt like they're really close-minded about some things. 

01:29:50
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  Okay. So in the meantime it sounds like you are struggling and you're hurt in the process. 

01:30:00
ADRIANNE Yeah, definitely. (sighs) I don't know. Uhm, sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough but I know I am. And I... (crosstalk) 

01:30:10
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. You're good enough, you're not good enough and you know you are. 

01:30:15
ADRIANNE Yeah. But it's like I'm always fighting or butting heads about it 'coz I know I am and I am. 'Coz this could always do worse. I'm not a bad kid you know. 

01:30:25
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:30:25
ADRIANNE But they always think the worst and they're so strict. I just, because they always think the worst. I don't know if they were when they were kids or whatever but I'm not them. 

01:30:35
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Right. I, I did hear you say two different things there though. You, it's like this, I could hear that struggle inside you right then. I'm not, I'm a, I'm a good kid. I could, I could be a lot worse. I'm a, I'm really a good kid but sometimes I don't think I am. 

01:30:50
ADRIANNE Yeah. They, they just hmm, they make me feel like sometimes I'm not. Sometimes I am terrible that I shouldn't be doing some things but like I still stick to it. Like I still stick to what I wanna do, (crosstalk) 

01:31:05
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:31:05
ADRIANNE my decisions and they're really going with that. I couldn't just you know, it's overwhelming on top of everything. 

01:31:15
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Hmm. 

01:31:15
ADRIANNE (laughs) So. 

01:31:20
[sil.] 

01:31:20
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  Overwhelming to not be abl to make your on decisions and... (crosstalk) 

01:31:25
ADRIANNE Yeah. It's just (sighs) I don't know. It's, it's really, I, I really don't know how to approach a person about it. 

01:31:35
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:31:35
ADRIANNE And I've tried to be op, I've tried to open. (crosstalk) 

01:31:35
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON It sounds like you want to approach them about it. 

01:31:40
ADRIANNE I do and I have tried in the past but it never worked. It never worked. And then like I kinda just did my own thing. I guess secrecy or whatever, kinda hid things from them 'coz uh, I think, I think some parents are better off not knowing some things... (crosstalk) 

01:31:55
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:31:55
ADRIANNE ...that their kids do. But it's just, I, I don't like that at all. (crosstalk) 

01:32:00
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:32:00
ADRIANNE Like I wanna be able to be open with them and I want them to be like oh, okay 'coz I have a, I have a friend that their parents is like that and it's really cool. (crosstalk) 

01:32:05
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON It's like you can do whatever kind of. 

01:32:10
ADRIANNE Well, not like whatever but I mean, if they do it, they're gonna give they're opinion no matter what and all parents are but no matter, if they do something that uh, they don't like but they do it anyway, (crosstalk) 

01:32:25
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:32:25
ADRIANNE they're not punishing them. They're just be like okay, yeah, whatever and like some, later on they'll joke about it... (crosstalk) 

01:32:30
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:32:30
ADRIANNE ...or something. I want that relationship, I'm very envious about it, that's what I want. 

01:32:35
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Okay. 

01:32:35
ADRIANNE But... (crosstalk) 

01:32:35
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON So you said a minute ago, you really want to confront your parents, you really wanna say something but you don't know how. So let's brainstorm together right now and, and kind of role play that. I can be, I can be the parents, okay, and you can be uh, you and just tell me as a parent what you would say. What would you say if I were your parents right now. 

01:32:55
ADRIANNE I want to be able to be uh, uhm, I want to make my own decisions and mistakes. You have to kinda let go 'coz I am getting older and I am getting that point and I'm choosing what colleges I want to go to you know, without your guidance help 'coz I'm not gonna like pays you off of that... (crosstalk) 

01:33:20
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Hmm. 

01:33:20
ADRIANNE ...and I'm trying to work for that, I'm trying to pay for it, trying to be responsible but I'm open, I'm only allowed to make those decisions myself that I can't make other decisions, like I either need, I mean more of it 'coz I am getting older and what about when I move out or do whatever and I don't know what to do like I need that, I need that like, as a person I need that to develop, I mean that when I get older for life experience and I wanna be, able to make my own mistakes and I'm tired of, I'm tired of parents always basing their decisions for their children to off of them(ph) when I don't know what their dis, their mistakes were... (crosstalk) 

01:34:05
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Hmm. 

01:34:05
ADRIANNE ...'coz obviously their not gonna tell me or relate to me 'coz we don't talk. They're not open, they're not open-minded... (crosstalk) 

01:34:10
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON I'm your parents remember, you're talking to me so you say... (crosstalk) 

01:34:10
ADRIANNE Yeah. (laughs) 

01:34:10
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON ...you're not open-minded, you're not. 

01:34:15
ADRIANNE You're not open-minded and you don't understand were I'm coming from. I try to understand were your coming from but you don't understand were I'm coming from and it's really hard when you don't compromise. You, when I date somebody you don't like, you base it off of their parents decisions and not them, like that is them. They are their own separate person just like I am and I really wish that, (sigh) I really wish that you would just give me that freedom 'coz I am becoming independent and I am getting older. I'm almost 18 and I need that independence. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:34:55
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON And I can see that you want that and I can see that that's very important to you... (crosstalk) 

01:34:55
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:34:55
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON ...however, you're still living in our house and you have a year and a half after and we want to help you make these, the best decisions that we know how and we're scared that you're gonna get hurt. 

01:35:05
ADRIANNE  Then let me get hurt. 

01:35:10
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON We're supposed to just watch while you get hurt? 

01:35:15
ADRIANNE Sometimes, if it was, it's like physical like somebody hurts me physically, but if it's emotionally let me get hurt, I'll learn from it. It's my, my experience, not yours. 

01:35:25
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. And I want to honor that you're saying that's your experience and I also have to balance that with being a good parent in using good judgment so maybe we can come to some sort of agreement and balance (coughs) that we haven't in the past. You're smiling as I said that, would that not happen? 

01:35:40
ADRIANNE No. (laughs) 

01:35:40
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  Wouldn't happen huh? 

01:35:45
ADRIANNE Definitely, too open-minded. 

01:35:45
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Too open-minded? 

01:35:45
ADRIANNE Oh yeah. 

01:35:45
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  So have you, you've sat down then and tried this conversation? 

01:35:50
ADRIANNE Yeah, many times actually, just... (crosstalk) 

01:35:50
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Just like that in a calm voice? 

01:35:55
ADRIANNE Yeah, actually. 

01:35:55
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Really? 

01:35:55
ADRIANNE Rea, so, okay. (laughs) I have tried it in a calm voice but it always ends up a little worse and a little... (crosstalk) 

01:36:05
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON A little worse so you tried it in calm voice but it was a li, it's a... (crosstalk) 

01:36:05
ADRIANNE A little worse and then the fight goes on and of course it turns into a fight... (crosstalk) 

01:36:10
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Yeah. 

01:36:10
ADRIANNE ...I mean I've tried it in a calm voice, we both talk or a little mostly like me and my dad or whatever. My, my mom doesn't really care, she'd, she's like err my way or no way but me and my dad have actually sat down and talked about it and I told them I want to be honest with you but I can't do that if you won't let me do this... (crosstalk) 

01:36:30
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Hmm. 

01:36:30
ADRIANNE ...and he just, he understood the first time and so as I was being honest with him and telling him things he just get, got mad and I don't know what else to do 'coz why, what... (crosstalk) 

01:36:45
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Yeah. 

01:36:45
ADRIANNE ...am I gonna tell him if he'll just gonna be mad at me or take something away like... (crosstalk) 

01:36:50
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. Well maybe if it's more, what if it's, what if it's more for you this kind of conveying how you think and how you feel what if that's more for you than it is about the result that you're gonna get 'coz (coughs) it sounds like you can't control the outcome, right? It sounds like you can't control what they're gonna say to you, (crosstalk) 

01:37:05
ADRIANNE Uh-oh. 

01:37:05
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON right? And you place a lot of pressure on yourself, you tell yourself you know, as they get mad at you, you're not a good person sometimes, you feel like your not a good person and you, you said they make you feel bad and they make you mad, so they, it sounds like they have a lot of power over how you feel. 

01:37:20
ADRIANNE  Yeah, I just, (sigh) they do 'coz I wanna, I still want them to be my parents... (crosstalk) 

01:37:30
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:37:30
ADRIANNE ...and I'm trying to be open with them as I get older 'coz as I get older I also face new experiences that they don't know about. 

01:37:35
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. So, it sounds like you're doing all, you're doing all that you know how to do right now. 

01:37:40
ADRIANNE Uh hmm. 

01:37:40
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  Yeah. 

01:37:45
ADRIANNE And they just, they don't understand it on my part, it's always one way... (crosstalk) 

01:37:50
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:37:50
ADRIANNE ...it's never how I'm handling or how it's gonna benefit me or hurt me, they think it's just gonna hurt me anything like they always think is just going to hurt me and it's not like if it does I learn from it... (crosstalk) 

01:38:05
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:38:05
ADRIANNE ...it's still my experience and they don't get that. 

01:38:05
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  So, I wanna go back to something that you said earlier, you, you said that this is your experience and I, and I understand that you wanna ha, your own person and it sounds like you're still doing that, right? Your, you're struggling to... (crosstalk) 

01:38:20
ADRIANNE Trying. 

01:38:20
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON ...you're trying but you're still doing that, your still... (crosstalk) 

01:38:20
ADRIANNE I'm, lately I've just kinda, I guess given up a little more like I said more reserved and then I noticed that change but before I was just very strong about it... (crosstalk) 

01:38:30
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:38:30
ADRIANNE ...I fought(ph) a lot and now that I come to you and I'm noticing this changes in myself, I have a feeling it's either going to be that worse and it has a little but actually like over the past few days... (crosstalk) 

01:38:45
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:38:45
ADRIANNE ...but I mean, here's something I can really, like I'm, I'm trying, I'm trying to compromise but they just don't wanna compromise. 

01:38:50
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  So it sounds like your uhm, you, you're trying 'coz you want to maintain this relationship yet. It's that something that realistically happen, I know(ph) that something you said earlier you are really concerned about. Is that something that realistically happen in your relationship would end? 

01:39:05
ADRIANNE  I hope not. 

01:39:10
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:39:10
ADRIANNE (inaudible ). 

01:39:13
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON What about in your end, 'coz we can't control that might(ph) we're talking about you. 

01:39:15
ADRIANNE Okay. Uhm, my end, if they keep this up for the rest of my life I'm just gonna exclude them from a lot of things that they wanna be included on. 

01:39:25
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON 'Coz it's hurtful to you. 

01:39:25
ADRIANNE It is very helpful, it's very hurtful, (crosstalk) 

01:39:25
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Yeah. 

01:39:25
ADRIANNE it's just, I don't know how, what to do. I don't know what, how to talk to them if they keep getting into my life and making my decisions when it's not their place... (crosstalk) 

01:39:35
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:39:35
ADRIANNE  like, they have to realize, yes, I'm a teenager but it's still not their place. It's not anybody's place, it's mine like it's my decision, something that I need to do as I'm getting older for myself and college, I have to make decision on college, I'm just, it's really stressful and uh, on top of this it's just all(ph) of you blocking out my decision of what, how I'm doing it on college 'coz what if I'm making it's a get of fa, as far way as from my parents as I can... (crosstalk) 

01:40:05
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:40:05
ADRIANNE ...what if it's not the right thing for me or you know those questions like that always run through my head and even with them. 

01:40:10
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  Sure, because you're hurt. 

01:40:15
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:40:15
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Yeah. Oh, I think it sounds too, like you're placing a lot of pressure outside. You talk a lot about your parents and you talk a lot about uhm, decision making based on them instead of focusing on you and so I'm, I'm hopeful that between now and the next time we see each other you'll maybe give yourself some time, think of an alternative(ph) would work for you, something that you would really like to do, not necessarily journalling if you decide that it doesn't work. 

01:40:40
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:40:40
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uhm, but like you said you've done it before and it's been somewhat successful and so... (crosstalk) 

01:40:45
ADRIANNE Yeah, but in the end it's just, it doesn't solve anything, it doesn't help me get through something, it's just something that kinda for the moment you know, (crosstalk) 

01:40:55
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. 

01:40:55
ADRIANNE  so. (crosstalk) 

01:41:00
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON It sounds like you wish you can have a resolution for them. 

01:41:00
ADRIANNE Uh hmm. 

01:41:00
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. And unfortunately we can't control other people whether it's about you and so, that's what I mean, between now and next time we see each other maybe focusing on something that you can do to help you feel better, right, because you're the one who has that control. You have the control of how you feel... (crosstalk) 

01:41:20
ADRIANNE Uh hmm. 

01:41:20
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON ...right? Did anybody else have control over how you feel... (crosstalk) 

01:41:25
ADRIANNE No. 

01:41:25
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON ...or can anybody else make you feel something? 

01:41:25
ADRIANNE Uhm, they can persuade it I guess. 

01:41:30
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Persuade it, yeah? 

01:41:30
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:41:30
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON But only you ha, you can give in, right? 

01:41:35
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:41:35
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Uh hmm. Okay, so would that be something that you'd be willing to try between now and the next time we see each other, either journalling or something else to give you an outlet can be your homework? 

01:41:45
ADRIANNE Yeah, I, I can try. 

01:41:45
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Okay. It was good to see you today, I look forward to seeing you again next time. 

01:41:50
ADRIANNE Me too. Thanks for listening to me. 

01:41:50
Comments 

01:41:50
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON  The counseling session with Adrianne using cognitive behavioral theory uhm, I wanted to talk about a few things that, what happened in the session. First of all, what I tried to do is challenge the way that Adrianne was thinking. It seemed to me that she was telling herself some things about herself based on what others had told her. So, she was thinking about or feeling that she was a good person or wasn't a good person based on what others were telling her and so I tried to challenge that uhm, and help her to realize that she can control her own thoughts. I used a little bit of humor and I used a little bit of confrontation to point out that yes, she thinks she's a good person and no, she doesn't think she's a good person uhm, and that she's kind of torn between this end of adolescent development and beginning of adulthood uhm, kind of phase and so I wanted her to see that she has a power, she has some power in that and that she can only control herself in the way that she is thinking. I also tried to model uhm, for her which is a part of cognitive behavioral theory, model for her appropriate uhm, communication, we did a role play and I was the parent and she was the adolescent uhm, kind of, to give her an idea of how to communicate calmly and then I challenged her again with humor in saying that uhm, is this the way that you convey things to your parents and she first said yes and then she kind of laugh and said, maybe it, maybe it would be exactly how. Uhm, also I challenged her positive self statements and asked her if she had, what she, what kinds of things she's hold herself about you know, how she got through the day. She said, she was overwhelmed of being a student, going to work and then coming home and not having very much time for herself and so, we talk a little bit about her positive self statements which is another uhm, tenet of cognitive behavioral theory. And the final thing that we did was uhm, a little homework assignment at the end, I had ask her if she had ever journal before and she said at times and at times they have been helpful, so again the focus on herself and I give her an outlet uhm, something that she could do instead of trying to control others reactions because we know we can't do that. We can only focus on our self, I had ask between now and the next time I see her for her to try some journalling as a homework assignment which is again uhm, a technique of cognitive behavioral theory. 

01:44:15
Wrap-Up Discussion With All 

01:44:15
EDWARD E. HAMANN  Well, Adrianne, Bill, Carrie I, I think we've had an interesting experience uh, during this time together. Uh, I don't have a necessarily prepared script at this point Adrianne except that I guess I'd like to throw to you any general uh, reactions to the experience this afternoon? 

01:44:35
ADRIANNE  Uhm, it, we really talked out the conflict with just between all three of you... (crosstalk) 

01:44:45
EDWARD HAMANN Uh hmm. 

01:44:45
ADRIANNE ...talking and it kinda got easier as it went. 

01:44:50
EDWARD E. HAMANN Okay. 

01:44:50
ADRIANNE But, I don't know. (laughs) 

01:44:50
EDWARD E. HAMANN Did you, is it possible for you to uh, summarize any differences in the approaches that really sort of stand out to you? A, a, maybe in terms of helpfulness. 

01:45:05
ADRIANNE Uhm, I don't know uh, actually cognitive and what he... (crosstalk) 

01:45:10
BILL MCFARLAND The reality therapy. 

01:45:10
ADRIANNE ...reality, very, very supportive. Very supportive(ph), I could, I could definitely distinct de, distinct between yours and theirs. 

01:45:15
EDWARD E. HAMANN Okay, so the solution focused felt different... (crosstalk) 

01:45:20
ADRIANNE Definitely. 

01:45:20
EDWARD E. HAMANN ...than those two together. 

01:45:20
ADRIANNE In, I think for my age group uhm, reality and the a cognitive were probably better... (crosstalk) 

01:45:30
EDWARD E. HAMANN Okay. 

01:45:30
ADRIANNE ...'coz uhm, uhm, if, asking on scale one, scales one to ten how I felt when, for my age its really hard to tell how you feel 'coz your just so confused as it is, I don't... (crosstalk) 

01:45:40
EDWARD E. HAMANN  Okay. (laughs) 

01:45:45
ADRIANNE ...giving, giving a number was really difficult 'coz I couldn't accurately give it to you... (crosstalk) 

01:45:50
EDWARD E. HAMANN Sure. Sure. Sure 

01:45:50
ADRIANNE ...'coz there was just uh, different things there's so many different things, just going on that teenagers had. 

01:45:55
EDWARD E. HAMANN Alright. 

01:45:55
ADRIANNE Uhm, I really liked how he complimented me, that was really, that was really cool, I mean, in the end like kind of just reassured me that, like you know, you're still a person, you're still doing, okay, you have the right to do what you're doing but all, at the same time like I'm just here to listen to you. Uhm, Dr. Albritton, Alexander-Albritton was actually uh, she went to uh, more approach how my parents would feel which also helped as well 'coz us having a lot of trouble and at the same time pe, with how my parents would feel, it was kinda the problem 'coz they are so close-minded so in that situation it kind of, was more difficult to have to relate to that 'coz it's more frustrating and also because... (crosstalk) 

01:46:40
EDWARD E. HAMANN Uh hmm. 

01:46:40
ADRIANNE ...she had bring up some emotions that could have been presented in that situation and that were true you know just a lot, it was really confusing... (crosstalk) 

01:46:45
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON It is the... (crosstalk) 

01:46:45
EDWARD E. HAMANN Uh hmm. 

01:46:45
ADRIANNE  like it has got more confusing. 

01:46:50
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

01:46:50
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON ...it is the most (inaudible ) about you though, right? 

01:46:52
ADRIANNE Yeah, they were about me... (crosstalk) 

01:46:52
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Yeah. 

01:46:52
ADRIANNE  and it's just, it really, well at the same time brought a lot of things in the perspective, (crosstalk) 

01:46:55
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Okay. 

01:46:55
ADRIANNE so, it was really cool, uhm, he more so was there to listen and let me make my own decisions I really liked... (crosstalk) 

01:47:05
BILL MCFARLAND Uh hmm. 

01:47:05
ADRIANNE ...uh, and they, actually the two of these more so touched on parenting rather than like with be overwhelming situation. Uh, that was, that was cool like it was cool to talk about all the stuff that uhm, it's just, it was different like you definitely (inaudible ) like your session between their, their sessions so. 

01:47:25
EDWARD E. HAMANN Differences anymore in addition to what you've just said or is that what you mean the differences were you felt sort of empowered by Dr. McFarland and, and you really sense that he listened to you and... (crosstalk) 

01:47:40
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:47:40
EDWARD E. HAMANN ...Dr. Alexander-Albritton... (crosstalk) 

01:47:40
ADRIANNE They, I felt like they really listened to me uhm, as a teenager like I can imagine how other people would feel 'coz I, I would like to think of myself as more mature and, but as a teenager if it was my level or lower I could see why they get really frustrated with that situation. 

01:48:00
EDWARD E. HAMANN Uh-huh. 

01:48:00
ADRIANNE With the having to number it 'coz even in the pain scale like, that even frustrates and Drs. (laughs) often says so. (crosstalk) 

01:48:05
EDWARD E. HAMANN  Alright. 

01:48:10
ADRIANNE But I mean, I, I really like to, that uhm, I felt like they, these two listen to me but I really likes what he complimented, so. 

01:48:15
EDWARD E. HAMANN Uh hmm. Very good. Okay. I don't know uh, Bill, Carrie anything you want to add or that summed it up pretty well for you? I don't mean to put you on the spot, any, any, some of your comments from the experience that you care to share, so(ph)? 

01:48:30
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON Well, I wanted to pick up on something that you said at the, at the very beginning of our wrap-up here and you said, well, by the third time I think it was, it was easier to talk... (crosstalk) 

01:48:40
ADRIANNE Yeah. 

01:48:40
CARRIE ALEXANDER-ALBRITTON ...I wonder what that was like for you to be able to have three different approaches in, in this, in this similar setting? 

01:48:45
ADRIANNE Yeah. I, I don't know maybe, the first approach might have been difficult just 'coz like I was really nervous, so... (crosstalk) 

01:48:50
EDWARD E. HAMANN That's(ph) so was I. 

01:48:55
ADRIANNE Yeah. (laughs) Uhm, that could, that could have been uh, difficulty to it but still it's pres(ph), present I like the whole numbering thing. I, I maybe something as an individual for me but... (crosstalk) 

01:49:05
EDWARD E. HAMANN Uh hmm. 

01:49:05
ADRIANNE ...I don't know. Uhm, as a third time I definitely got more, it got a lot easier (laughs) to talk about it... (crosstalk) 

01:49:10
