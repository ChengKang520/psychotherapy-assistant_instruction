NANCY ROBERTS My children will say that you're no better mother, about the alcohol and the drugs Xanax was devastating just devastating to me. 

00:00:35
MAE LIGHT I thought I was fooling the world and the only one that I was fooling was myself. 

00:00:40
JAMES CAMPBELL There is some age based assumptions that you can't teach an old dog new tricks. People think that old people are hard to treat and so they’re unlikely refer them for treatment and unfortunately sometimes the treatment agencies are unlikely to want to accept that for that same reason. 

00:00:55
JOHN ROMANOWSKI (inaudible ) there is always hope. 

00:01:00
 I told my wife, I'm going to give up training for you. 

00:01:05
JAMIE GUTH Today on "The Doctor Is In" will look at substance abuse in the elderly.

00:01:25
THE DOCTOR IS IN 

00:01:30
JAMIE GUTH Hello, I'm Jamie Guth. When an older person has a substance abuse problem, there are many reasons it can go untreated. We may think symptoms like slurred speech, forgetfulness, clumsiness or depression can be caused by old age, but think again. 

00:01:50
JAMIE GUTH The Cocktail Hour, good conversation with good friends, it's a social ritual that many of today's senior citizens have enjoyed all of their adult lives. To remain social drinkers, they have learned to decrease the quantity of alcohol they drink. 

00:02:05
 I'm Wilson(ph), thank you. 

00:02:10
JAMIE GUTH That's because as we grow older, the body's ability to metabolize alcohol decreases. For some, this lesson isn't easily learned. 

00:02:20
JAMES CAMPBELL , MD Medical Director of Alcoholism Services Metrohealth Medical Center, Cleveland And so sometimes feel, we get into trouble because what they say to you is they say well I'm drinking the same amount I've always drank. And what that mean is there is actually, greatly increase their standing blood alcohol concentration and how much they're running around with. Because the normal answer when you ask older folks is that how much you drink, so, you know I just don't drink as much as I used to. So, why not that’s in… that doesn't feel right, no particular reason just sort of, they automatically adjust to control for that sort of uncomfortable feeling of being having too high blood alcohol concentration. 

00:02:50
 …your own time… 

00:02:50
JAMES CAMPBELL Yeah, I understand. 

00:02:50
JAMIE GUTH Dr. James Campbell is Chair of Family Medicine at Metrohealth Medical Center in Cleveland and a national known expert on substance abuse in the elderly. Dr. Campbell says that substance abuse is as common among older adults as it is in younger people. 

00:03:05
JAMES CAMPBELL What you are talking about is probably on the order of 8-10% of the population is using substances in a way that significantly impacting on their lives. 

00:03:20
JAMIE GUTH One thing that is different among older substance abusers is the drug of choice. Far and away the most common substance being abused is alcohol. Illegal drug use is relatively uncommon. 

00:03:30
Alcohol and the Elderly 2/3 Early Onset 1/3 Late Onset 

00:03:35
JAMIE GUTH Two-thirds of elderly alcohol have had problems all their adult lives, this is known as Early Onset Alcoholism. But about one-third of elderly alcoholics are categories as Late Onset meaning that alcohol appears to become a problem only in recent years. But this distinction can be deceiving. 

00:03:55
JAMES CAMPBELL Oftentimes, what you find is that people say well, they never had a problem until they were old. But when you look back more closely may be they did have a problem in their 20s may be and another problem in their 40s and then they sort of did okay until they were 65 or 70 and then they started to have another problem whether that of alcohols impacting on a disease they have or they use alcohol in the concept sort of working around the death, their spouse or something like that and all the sudden people notice the problem in a more dramatic way. 

00:04:25
JAMIE GUTH You are in a comfortable South Florida Gated Community, 76-year-old Mae Light is in her 4th year of sobriety. Though her only roommate these days is the four-legged variety. For 37 years Mae and her first husband enjoyed happy and fulfilling life in suburban New York. They married during World War II when he was a handsome officer. Together they made a dashing couple. 

00:04:55
MAE LIGHT Every woman should have a husband like this. They didn't make him any better. 

00:05:00
JAMIE GUTH But 20 years ago, when Mae was 56, her husband passed away. 

00:05:05
MAE LIGHT When my husband died, I was devastated. He was the lovely in my life. 

00:05:15
JAMIE GUTH Rather than taking the time to deal with her grief, Mae was remarried within a year. The second marriage was unhappy from the start and only lasted four years. But that was long enough for Mae to change from a social drinker into an alcoholic. 

00:05:30
MAE LIGHT I wasn't smart enough to realize that you can't bypass any emotion. 

00:05:40
MAE LIGHT We're going in. 

00:05:45
MAE LIGHT But basically that's what my drinking was based on. I thought I could bypass mourning. 

00:05:55
JAMIE GUTH Like many Late Onset alcoholics, Mae likes special relationship with alcohol had begun many years earlier. It just had never become a problem in her life before. I always drunk more than anybody else, but it was never had a control. I like what alcohol did to me. I become a better dancer, ah… I relax more, I could talk more and the same applied over the years. 

00:06:25
JAMIE GUTH By the time Mae's second marriage ended when she was 62, her drinking was clearly out of control. She was starting to experience blackouts which scared her enough to ask a psychologist for help. 

00:06:35
MAE LIGHT And the psychologist said, he would not take me on as a patient, unless I joined AA. And so, I joined AA I had got a sponsor, I went through the 12 steps, even did some speaking. 

00:06:55
JAMIE GUTH After two years of sobriety Mae moved from New York to Florida and her commitment to AA fell apart. 

00:07:00
MAE LIGHT I was in my mid 60s and I cited You could… you know after all, you are a mature person, you know what to do, you don't have to go to meetings that you don't like and so I stopped going to meetings. Bad, bad, bad. 

00:07:25
JAMIE GUTH Mae began drinking again. First it was limited to evenings, but eventually became a round-the-clock habit. 

00:07:30
Emergency 

00:07:35
JAMIE GUTH It was a long before she hit bottom. 

00:07:35
MAE LIGHT I remember, it was a Sunday and I had going out, I don't know how, I played golf I came home, went right to the vodka cabinet and drank. I drank so much that I had passed, I passed out for two days. 

00:08:00
JAMIE GUTH When Mae regain consciousness after 48 hours, she phoned her son in St. Louis who told her to call 911. After detoxification in a local hospital, Mae was admitted to a treatment center. Today, she continues to work on her sobriety, one day at a time. 

00:08:20
MAE LIGHT Baby behave yourself. 

00:08:20
JAMIE GUTH Her regular schedule includes AA meetings and other therapy. It's a lot of work, but to Mae Light it's worth it. 

00:08:30
MAE LIGHT I have today more confidence in myself than I ever had in my entire life. There's lots of things going on in this world, they mean not all be good, why not be aware of them to enjoy with the grandchildren and the great-grandchildren. When you are drunk, you can’t enjoy anything. 

00:08:55
JAMIE GUTH If it's a Wednesday morning at the Kit Clark Senior Center in Dorchester, Massachusetts, you can bet that John Romanowski will be walking in the door. The center offers a wide range of recreational and other services for seniors in this working class community. But it's not the nutritious meals or the opportunity to chat with friends in the first floor lounge, they bring John to the center each week. For him, the most important service Kit Clark offers is the group therapy session for elderly substance abusers. 

00:09:30
JOHN ROMANOWSKI My life… 

00:09:30
JOHN ROMANOWSKI Today, I'm 60 years old but I'm proud of it, really proud of it. For me to go 60 years is a miracle like (inaudible ) believe me, that's what it is to me. 

00:09:45
JAMIE GUTH When you consider the fact that John Romanowski was a drinking alcoholic from the age of 16 until he was 66, you may be inclined to agree with him that his sobriety is a miracle. But older alcoholics who seek help have the highest success rate of any age group. John's life was a serious of alcohol related troubles. Petty crimes well in the military, a broken marriage, arrest for driving under the influence and countless evictions, the disease of alcoholism shaped most of his life. 

00:10:20
JOHN ROMANOWSKI We can't scare an alcoholic, we couldn't scare me… I don't care, we couldn't scare me booze come before everything, come before my wife, come before everything. The bill I used to make paper planes(ph) out of them and (inaudible ) file it, that was my filing (inaudible ) 

00:10:43
JAMIE GUTH Though his middle aged years John worked as machinist who was told that if he wasn't sober during the week, he'd be out of the job. So, he became a weekend drunk still a long way from confronting his alcoholism. 

00:10:55
JOHN ROMANOWSKI I was playing a game and I was hurting myself because I wasn't letting myself get as drunk as I wanted to get drunk. I was holding yet, I was gone against myself. 

00:11:10
New England Shelter for Homeless Veterans 

00:11:10
JAMIE GUTH Once he retired, John stopped trying to control his urge to drink all day, every day. Unable to keep in his own apartment, he eventually moved to a shelter for veterans. A counselor there found him more permanent housing in a group living section in this building, very much an independent type, John did not like giving up his privacy. 

00:11:35
JOHN ROMANOWSKI Share the kitchen, share the bed, share, share I was sick of (inaudible ) sharing this, sharing that. 

00:11:45
JOHN ROMANOWSKI Oh another, another bill. 

00:11:45
JAMIE GUTH John was told he would qualify for a private apartment in the building but only if he sought treatment for his alcoholism, and became sober. That was the motivation he needed. John began a substance abuse therapy group at Kit Clark. He resisted what he was hearing at first. But started to listen after a fellow member of the group warned him of dying drunk in miserable if he didn't stop. 

00:12:10
JOHN ROMANOWSKI He told that straight I love that, loved what he said I shook his hands as a thanks Jo that you help me you know, this is time to put away my toys, I'm getting older, my legs are gone and I can't breathe right, I don't want to get that emphysema or whatever who called up from fright or whatever, but I think it's more or less the grace of God, my higher power, that I find him, believe and here I'm today. I'm so… and proud of it. 

00:13:00
GEORGIA NEILL What do you like about sobriety? 

00:13:00
 I love it everything. 

00:13:00
JAMIE GUTH Georgia Neill leads substance abuse therapy sessions at Kit Clark. She says that many people still believe older substance abusers can't stop even though study show this group has the high success rate in treatment. 

00:13:15
GEORGIA NEILL Kit Clark Senior Services What we see in our program day-in and day-out is older people coming and who do change and when they stop drinking, their lives, the quality of their lives really improves. And… and they… they can improve in many ways, their physical health sometimes improves even if it doesn't dramatically improves at least they are preventing some other problems from getting worse um… their cognitive abilities often improve because alcohol can… can damage brains and sometimes that damages permanent but often it's reversible so that if they stay sober for a while, they start clearing up and can think more clearly, could remember better relationships improve when they stop drinking because how many of us like to be around drunk people, it's… it's not a real feeling. And also their self-esteem improves dramatically. They feel much better about themselves. 

00:14:05
JOHN ROMANOWSKI Oh, I can hear the bird sing, I can see the sunshine. I can take a walk and feel proud of myself. Now, looking over my shoulder, see if anybody is following me, it just the glorious feeling for me. The really is, I really believe Kit Clark has saved my life. I love it, I wouldn't trait it, it’s my home, I can finally say, I'm home. 

00:14:40
JAMIE GUTH Home for Nancy and Alan Roberts is a one storey house in South Florida, designed for them by their son. The living as I say is easy, but that hasn't always been the case. Nancy has fought several times with alcoholism. But it seemed to be under-controlled after she retired. 

00:14:55
NANCY ROBERTS In the first couple of years we're wonderful. Did all the crafts and flower arrangement, all that running around, and then my husband needed my car. He had lost the company car, so I sat home for 2 years, didn't pick up the telephone, didn't go to meetings, I just sat home, as a result I started having panic attacks. 

00:15:25
ALAN ROBERTS I didn't know what a panic attack was, we were out driving one day and she says I'm having a panic attack, I got to go to the hospital, I said there is nothing wrong with you why to go to a hospital, nothing physically wrong with you. 

00:15:35
JAMIE GUTH As difficult as it was for her husband to understand, Nancy's increasing panic attacks were quite real, to treat the condition Nancy was given a prescription for an anti-anxiety medication called Xanax, it's one of the drugs known as Benzodiazepines, which to people with a history of alcoholism can be highly addictive. 

00:15:55
ALAN ROBERTS Its to the brain, it's like taking a straight drink of alcohol, like taking a shot, the brain doesn't know whether it is alcohol or whether it is a tranquilizer or whatever. 

00:16:10
NANCY ROBERTS I took the prescription home from the hospital, I refilled, and I was often roaming overdosing, getting out of bed to go to the bathroom, falling on the floor, missed one arm for a week, ten days until I begged to go back to the hospital. 

00:16:30
ALAN ROBERTS So, here I am, first of all I learned what panic attacks are, then she is going in for St. Mental Hospital four times within about a four-month period, and I am getting a little upset, I'm getting a little angry and I'm wondering but arguing why don't we go and put her in a mental hospital for the rest of the life or whatever 

00:16:50
JAMIE GUTH Fortunately, help was close at hand, in West Palm Beach The Hanley Hazelden Center has a special program dedicated to the treatment of older people with substance abuse problems. Carol Colleran Egan is the programs director, the most of the substance abuse problems she sees are alcohol related addiction to other drugs is also a major problem. 

00:17:15
CAROL COLLERAN EGAN , CAP, ICADC Hanley-Hazelden Center The majority of older adults, that are being identified and are coming into treatment are not using street drugs if you will. The majority are using prescription medication and we have a lot of focus in our country on younger people and illegal drugs and here we have a whole generation of people that are getting (inaudible ) and perfectly legal drugs. The most commonly abused prescription medication for older adults is in the benzodiazepine family of drugs which is Valium and Xanax and Librium these are tranquilizers. We are getting older adults in treatment that have been on prescription for Valium for 15, 20 and 25 years, and I don't know if you are aware but Valium was initially designed to be a 14 day trauma drug. 

00:18:10
JAMIE GUTH Carol Colleran Egan was an advisor for a major study on older woman in substance abuse, conducted by Columbia University, their findings show that physicians are 37% more likely to prescribe a tranquilizer for an older woman, than for an older man, prescription drug addiction in the elderly isn't so much a matter of over prescribing, but rather inappropriately prescribing and sometimes even underprescribing. 

00:18:35
JAMES CAMPBELL If somebody who has genuine pain, you know whether it is arthritis or whatever it is. They virtually never become genuinely addicted, you really can go ahead, and liberalize even the use of you know fairly strong pain medicines for chronic pain is fully acceptable, and unfortunately it doesn't used enough. 

00:18:55
JAMIE GUTH When elderly people don't receive the prescription pain medications they really need for ailments like arthritis, they sometimes try alcohol as a pain killer. 

00:19:05
JAMES CAMPBELL Alcohol actually is a very ineffective pain killer and really should never be used as a pain killer. And it also unfortunately interacts with many of the pain killer that are out there, both over the counter and prescription pain killers. 

00:19:15
JAMIE GUTH Another common but ineffective use of alcohol is drinking a nightcap in the evening to sleep better. Alcohol can help someone go to sleep faster but it decreases the quality of sleep throughout the night. 

00:19:30
JAMES CAMPBELL Sleep is not a sort of on/off phenomenon, when you go into sleep, you go deeper in the sleep and the lighter and cycle up and down, what happens unfortunately with older folks is that about every two hours, that cycle brings them very close to being awake again, and if they're not careful, they actually will then wake up. Alcohol does that exact same thing, and causes exacerbation of that and makes it more of a problem. That's why they never feel rest, and they never feel like to get an adequate sleep. 

00:20:00
JAMIE GUTH Dr. Campbell says that elderly patients as a whole are not being diagnosed and treated for depression, that was eventually realized that Nancy Roberts was suffering from depression, and she is responding well to anti-depressant medication, but medical treatment was a small part of our daily care at Hanley-Hazelden. 

00:20:20
 You can be at success by doing three simple things. 

00:20:25
NANCY ROBERTS They are kept as busy from 7:00 in the morning till 4:30, I was exhausted. Ten women and six men and we said to each other we were alcoholics, they didn't have to say anything else because I know, what an alcohol person feels like inside. 

00:20:45
 Roll our shoulders and roll back down. 

00:20:50
JAMIE GUTH The program at Hanley Hazelden is comprehensive, exercise classes teach the patients to become more aware of, and more caring of their physical health, and a lot of attention is paid to helping them prepare for a new lives after treatment, knowing how to use e-mail for example, is a good way to break the pattern of social isolation that many elderly substance abusers fall into. Because everyone in the program is an older adult, the atmosphere is less threatening and more conducive to a successful recovery. 

00:21:20
NANCY ROBERTS They know what I am talking about, when I complain about the pains in my knees, they know immediately that I have arthritis, when I am feeling a little tired and depressed, that's part of our age. The hormones have stopped popping and were slowing down, and we don't have to explain or apologize for this. These are the facts of life, our bodies have slowed down and I think, that's why the alcohol hits us a satire(ph) and hard. 

00:22:00
JAMIE GUTH Alan Roberts attended programs for family members at Hanley Hazelden as he has learning more about substance abuse and recovery, his anger toward Nancy's disease has gone away. 

00:22:10
ALAN ROBERTS Like any situation, I think you got to get out and reopen, if you keep it bottled up, it's going to be a problem, and I see now, the way Nancy is progressing so forth, things were getting better, our life is getting a lot better. And I think dose(ph) is over. 

00:22:30
NANCY ROBERTS That was good. 

00:22:30
ALAN ROBERTS That was good. 

00:22:35
JAMIE GUTH As a group older people respond very well to treatment for substance abuse, the problem is that too few actually enter treatment, they are often ashamed to admit they have a problem. 

00:22:45
CAROL COLLERAN EGAN Shame is the number one issue for older adults coming into treatment, now they grew up in a time when alcoholism the disease was connected with that man under the bridge if you will. So it was a shameful thing, ah... if actually drink too much and cause problems that was put in the back room and we really didn't discuss those things. 

00:23:10
JAMIE GUTH The other difficulty in getting older adults into treatment is that often people around them don't recognize, there is a problem, sometimes that's because we underestimate the capabilities of older people. 

00:23:20
JAMES CAMPBELL Take for example you know, a 75-year-old man is driving down the road, and he is sort of doing a little wavering over the center line, when he gets out of the car, the officers gonna have start to make age based assumptions and say well I know that old people don't know have to drive well, I know that this guy may be has whatever, whatever and whatever and he may not even think about whether person has alcohol on board. The same with a 30-year-old man they're going to pretty quickly decide, they wanted to decide whether he is alcohol on board. 

00:23:55
 I got you weaving around back there… 

00:23:55
JAMES CAMPBELL And so they are very resistant to being identified as having an alcohol problem. In addition their families were also less like to see them, and their physicians are less likely to see them. If you have an older person who has got trouble with their memory, who has trouble of falls any of those type of issues, you should look, is there a possibility there is an underlying substance problem, this may not be just a result of old age. And the problem is there is just not enough people looking underneath and finding the treatable problem. 

00:24:25
JAMIE GUTH The more of us know about the problem of substance abuse the better. A meals on wheels volunteer or a postal carrier can help identify problems, often these are the only people and older person actually speaks with on a regular basis, but if we do recognize a problem, how should we speak to older people about it. 

00:24:45
JAMES CAMPBELL The most important thing is to make sure that you have a couple of attendance(ph) in your friendship you know, one is to say, I am telling you this because I care about you. 

00:24:55
 Something I want to talk to you about for a long time, you've been drinking an awful lot and I think you might have a drinking problem. 

00:25:00
 I don't have a problem… 

00:25:05
JAMES CAMPBELL Like sometimes, you eventually have to sort of agree to disagree, but you don't say well, if you don't agree with me, I'm never going to be a friend again, necessarily. But you don't have to buy into say well okay, I'll say you don't have a problem, so we can continue to be married or we can continue to be whatever, but you have to be very concrete. 

00:25:25
 I mean, we missed you at the wedding. I've... I wanted to see you there and you were home drinking. 

00:25:30
JAMES CAMPBELL Be very, very concrete and be non-judgmental, you know it's not about the older person or any other substance abuser being a "Bad person" somebody has pneumonia, we don't say it's your fault you have pneumonia. It's not their fault, they have a substance abuse problem, but it is treatable, if they can get through that. 

00:25:50
JAMIE GUTH As today's baby boomer generation becomes tomorrow's elderly generation, the treatment community is expecting that illegal drug abuse will be a much larger problem in the elderly. 

00:26:00
JAMES CAMPBELL It will be interesting to watch but there is a lot of activity around, marijuana in its inhaled form and what that impact that would be on ageing lungs and respiratory physiology and the development of emphysema in the same way, that you are taking an ageing heart, if you are exposing that ageing heart to an exciting agent such as cocaine, which is going to cause arrhythmias and other problems even in very young healthy hearts, you are going to see a lot more problems develop. 

00:26:30
JAMIE GUTH Whatever the form substance abuse in the elderly takes, one thing is certain, treating an elderly persons substance abuse problem is a lot cheaper, than ignoring it. 

00:26:40
 Did you mention anything about your liver test? 

00:26:45
 That they are normal. 

00:26:45
 Maybe okay with you, if I contact... 

00:26:45
Medical Complications •Gastritis •Bleeding ulcers •Broken hip •Broken ankle •Falls •Medication side effects 

00:26:45
JAMES CAMPBELL What's the result of that person's continued drinking, they're likely to get hospitalized with gastritis, bleeding ulcers, broken hip, broken ankle, falls you know bleeding into their head, they're likely to have medication side effects from either noncompliance from being drunk or super compliance at other times, and all of those things actually have reliably shown that anybody who have got an active substance abuse problem spends a huge amount of money in health care resource dollars and far the way the cheapest thing you can do is to treat the underlying substance abuse, and many of those other dollars will never have to be spent. 

00:27:25
JAMIE GUTH Of course the best reasons to treat substance abuse problems have nothing to do with dollars and cents. How can you count the value of an older persons renewed sense of dignity and happiness. 

00:27:40
GEORGIA NEILL When I see someone who has been drinking whether it's been you know heavily a few years or most of their lives, change that and stop drinking and the changes that come about from that can be really remarkable. I have seen people really turn their lives around, and its inspiring. 

00:27:55
JAMIE GUTH If you are in doubt about whether or not you have a substance abuse problem. Ask yourself these questions. 

00:28:00
Do you think you have a problem? Does anyone else think you have a problem with substance abuse? Does anyone give you a hard time about substance abuse? 

00:28:05
JAMIE GUTH Do you think you have a problem? Does anyone else think you have a problem with substance abuse? Does anyone give you a hard time about substance abuse? If the answer is yes to any of these questions, see your doctor or call a alcoholic anonymous. There is always help available and it really is, never too late to change.
