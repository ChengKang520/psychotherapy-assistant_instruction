THE DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA PRESENTED BY: DR. D. GOLDBERG UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER ENGLAND 

00:00:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Many psychiatrists and psychologists have tried to devise diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia in terms of underlying theories of schizophrenic mechanisms. But no single theory has been entirely satisfactory. Any psychiatrist, as he listens to a patient describe abnormal psychological experiences to him, asks himself whether the symptoms that are being described to him can be understood in terms of three main variables. 

00:00:40
- PREVIOUS PERSONALITY - MOOD STATE - CURRENT LIFE SITUATION 

00:00:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG First, what he knows of the patient's underlying personality. Second, what he can tell of the patient's present mood state. And third, what he can learn about the patient's current life situation. If the psychiatrist is able to empathize with these symptoms in terms of any combination of these three variables, he is most unlikely to make a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Schizophrenic experiences are those, which cannot be understood in these terms. Unfortunately though, if we were to use this as the criterion for schizophrenia, there would be much variation between clinicians because different individuals will go to very different lengths in their attempts to understand their patient's experiences. This videotape then is going to be concerned with some criteria for the diagnosis of schizophrenia that have been known for a long time and have stood the test of time. There are those used by the World Health Organization in their international studies of schizophrenia and they're known to have very high- 

00:02:00
SCHNEIDER'S FIRST RANK SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA 

00:02:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG - reliability when used between clinicians. The symptoms were first described by the German psychiatrist, Schneider, and he said that when any of these first rank symptoms are present, one may make the decisive clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia providing that there is no abnormal cerebral process going on. The symptoms are not in terms of any underlying theory of schizophrenia since they're based purely on clinical experience. If you are to elicit these symptoms in your patients, then, at any time in an interview, when you suspect that one of the symptoms may be present, you'll have to use fairly directive interviewing techniques. If you are to make sure whether the symptom is present or not, you're going to hear me do this in the excerpts that follow. The symptoms themselves can be divided into four rough groups. First, a three source, a very typical auditory hallucination. Then, there's a group of three kinds of disturbances of thinking. Next, come a group of four kinds of passivity phenomena, what Schneider called "made experiences". And finally, there's a very abnormal experience called delusional perception. The first of the groups of auditory hallucination is called audible thoughts. 

00:03:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG This symptom has a number of different names. It's often called thought echo in English, echo de la pensee in French and Gedankenlautwerden in German. What you must elicit is that the thoughts are spoken as a true auditory hallucination. That is to say, a voice with all the characteristics of a normal human voice is heard arising from outside the patient's head and the voice either say something which the patient is then obliged to think or simultaneous with the patient thinking something, the voice says it or just after the patient has thought something, the voice repeats it in a clearly audible voice. We'll now see an example of this phenomenon. 

00:04:25
DR. D. GOLDBERG Can I first of all start by asking you whether the voice seems to be like a real voice, like my voice seems to you when you do hear it? 

00:04:30
  Yes, it seemed just like you and I talking. Only difference is I don't get to talk back. 

00:04:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Yeah, I understand that. (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
 'Coz I'm, yes, 'coz I'm, I'm, is, there's no way of telling how, uhm, if I'm transmitting or not... (crosstalk) 

00:04:45
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh-huh. 

00:04:45
 Back to the voice... (crosstalk) 

00:04:45
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. 

00:04:45
 Sudden voices. 

00:04:45
DR. D. GOLDBERG  But the voices are real voice, then, does it seem to come from some particular spot? 

00:04:50
 Ah, not necessarily. 

00:04:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG It'll just come from sort of anywhere? 

00:04:55
 That's right. 

00:04:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. 

00:04:55
 Just like I could be sitting outside there and cars pass by and I would take a message, so to speak. 

00:05:05
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:05:05
  So it could come from any place... (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. 

00:05:10
 ...at anytime. 

00:05:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. But if the cars are going by, the voice will seem to come from the cars, will it or? 

00:05:15
 No, just before the car approaches... (crosstalk) 

00:05:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. 

00:05:20
 ...I would, ah, hear this particu, particular voice and then a car would go by. 

00:05:25
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. So, it's a real voice and it comes from outer space, not always localized. What sort of things does it say? 

00:05:30
  Oh, it tells me, mostly, I think it is there, they're reading my thoughts. 

00:05:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:05:35
  That's, that's, by what they do, they don't really come in... (crosstalk) 

00:05:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uhm. 

00:05:40
 ...and tell me anything in specific, you know. 

00:05:45
DR. D. GOLDBERG So there, they would pick your thoughts out loud? 

00:05:45
 Yes, to me. 

00:05:50
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. So, you have a thought from the voice says the thought out loud. 

00:05:50
 That's right. 

00:05:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG Is there a little delay before it says it or does it say it the moment you think it? 

00:05:55
  Ah, you mean, oh, I don't understand that. 

00:06:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG Well, you have a thought. 

00:06:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:06:05
DR. D. GOLDBERG Now, does the voice say the thought as you're thinking it or is there a little moment's delay and then the voice says the thought after you thought it? 

00:06:10
  Ah, the thoughts come from outside, usually I, I'm not concentrating... (crosstalk) 

00:06:15
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:06:15
  and when the voice come, ah, is, there's the subconscious mind bringing out what I have subconsciously... (crosstalk) 

00:06:25
DR. D. GOLDBERG Sure. 

00:06:25
 ...in my mind... (crosstalk) 

00:06:25
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. 

00:06:25
 ...they bring that out. 

00:06:30
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. But sometimes, does the voice say things that you're thinking of consciously, then you're thinking something and the voice says it out loud. 

00:06:35
 Yes. 

00:06:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. And I think sometimes, you were telling me before, the voice will say something and then it becomes one of your thoughts. That's happened to you, doesn't it? 

00:06:45
 Yes. 

00:06:45
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. Do they happen... (crosstalk) 

00:06:45
  No, that, but, (crosstalk) 

00:06:50
DR. D. GOLDBERG ...pretty often? 

00:06:50
 but that, when, when, when, when that happen, ah, it just, ah, it, it affects me just a little, not much because part of that thought was mine in the beginning. 

00:07:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG To sometimes the voices say something and then you think it afterwards or is it always the other way around? 

00:07:05
  Sometimes it says something and I think it afterwards. 

00:07:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. When you think it, it's your thought, is it? 

00:07:10
  Yeah. 

00:07:15
DR. D. GOLDBERG The next symptom is hearing voices arguing. There are usually two or more hallucinatory voices in disagreement or in discussion. The subject is usually the patient who is often referred to in the third person although it sometimes referred to in the second person. Listen to this example. 

00:07:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Do you ever hear pe, voices arguing with one another? 

00:07:40
 Yes. 

00:07:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
 Yes. 

00:07:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Tell me about that, could you? 

00:07:45
 Well, instead of they say dirty words back and forth to each others... (crosstalk) 

00:07:50
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:07:50
 And... (crosstalk) 

00:07:50
DR. D. GOLDBERG More than one voice? 

00:07:50
 ...it's more than one person. 

00:07:50
DR. D. GOLDBERG Man and a woman or? 

00:07:55
 Man's and woman's. 

00:07:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. 

00:07:55
 And they sound like young people voices, too. 

00:08:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:08:00
 They don't sound like a real old person voice. 

00:08:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG Do they have arguments about you sometimes? 

00:08:05
 Well, sometimes, some want my money and I'll tell the next one to stop doing what they're doing and leave me alone. 

00:08:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:08:10
 And the next one, she's a very dirty person. She said she will never quit what's she doing. 

00:08:15
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Uhm. 

00:08:20
 She gonna do what she wanted to do and she gonna see that I die. 

00:08:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uhm. Uh hmm. What does the women, woman's voice say? 

00:08:25
 Well, the woman voice is always saying things about my husband. 

00:08:30
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. What sort of things? 

00:08:30
 She tells me that she's in love with my husband and, and she's gonna have this man (inaudible ) so what she gonna get this man. 

00:08:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:08:40
 And when she get me away, then, she and him can live happy... (crosstalk) 

00:08:45
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uhm. 

00:08:45
 In the world. 

00:08:45
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:08:45
 But she'll be tickled to death to see me in the graveyard. 

00:08:50
DR. D. GOLDBERG Sure. Sure. And then the man's voice sometimes says kinder things about you, does he? 

00:08:55
 Well, the man voice don't says much as the woman voice does. 

00:08:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:08:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG  The next symptom is hearing voices commenting on one's actions. The content of the auditory hallucination is a description of the patient's activities as they occur. Here's an example of that. 

00:09:15
DR. D. GOLDBERG They ever give a running commentary on what you're doing, saying now she' doing this... (crosstalk) 

00:09:20
 Yes. Yes, it does. 

00:09:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG Tell me the sort of things they say. Give me an example. 

00:09:25
 They say just like I was walking down in King Street, they said, "Thelma is in the corner of one friend in meetings. 

00:09:30
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uhm. 

00:09:30
 'Coz I'm thinking that. I'm thinking way I am and they can say, well, "Thelma and Ed was enough. 

00:09:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:09:40
 And then she can say, "Oh, she said, the face polish cost five dollars and twenty cents." She said, "I can't afford that." I'd rather keep it with what Thelma(ph) do but I can't afford that. And different thing like that and she said, "Oh, she bought her a housecoat." 

00:09:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG And you just had bought a housecoat from the voices. (crosstalk) 

00:09:55
 And I just had bought the housecoat. 

00:09:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. 

00:09:55
  Everything I can do. (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. And they call you she. (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
 They know it. 

00:10:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. They say she has bought the housecoat. 

00:10:00
  They said Thelma. 

00:10:05
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. I see. 

00:10:05
 They never said she. They called me by my name. 

00:10:05
DR. D. GOLDBERG I see. 

00:10:05
 And everything I can do, they know. 

00:10:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uhm. 

00:10:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Does it ever, ah, give a commentary on what you are doing? 

00:10:20
 Yes. I'm going to take you to show. 

00:10:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:10:20
 No one will take you to show. 

00:10:25
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. Tell me the sort of things that the voice will say while you're doing something? 

00:10:30
 They say, "You're going to take, you're going to write a letter now." 

00:10:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG You're about to write a letter now? 

00:10:40
 Yeah. 

00:10:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:10:40
 You, you got to to take a shower or something like that. 

00:10:45
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. You're about to take a shower, yeah. Does it keep that up all the time? 

00:10:50
 Yeah. 

00:10:50
DR. D. GOLDBERG Even when you're doing quite ordinary things. 

00:10:55
 Yeah. And then when I went to a job, they didn't miss out, go out on the streets. 

00:11:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG  The first of the disturbances of thought is thought withdrawal. In this symptom, the patient describes his thoughts being taken from his mind. As his thought cease, he simultaneously experiences them being withdrawn by some external force. We haven't been able to find a perfect example of this while we made this tape, but here is a patient describing a very similar experience. 

00:11:30
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Uhm, in my office, you are telling me that sometimes, something just comes and withdraws the thoughts out of your head. 

00:11:40
 Yes. Yes, it does. 

00:11:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG Tell me about that. What do you notice? 

00:11:40
 Well, sometime, I just seems like my head is on a open level when they withdraw these things away from my head. But what it is they withdraw in my mind away? 

00:11:50
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uhm. 

00:11:50
 I do not have mind enough to sleep. 

00:11:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG The next symptom is called thought broadcasting. The patient, while he's thinking, has the experience that his thoughts are not contained within his own mind. The thoughts escape from the confines of itself into the outside world where they may be experienced by all around. This is usually a secondary delusional explanation by how this happens, often, using telepathy, television or little microscopic transmitters. The first example you'll hear of this has just such a delusional explanation of his thought broadcasting. 

00:12:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG Have you ever had the experience that your thoughts could be picked up by other people? 

00:12:40
 Yes. 

00:12:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG Just tell me about that, could you? 

00:12:40
 Well, I can, like I said the name of a girl is in my mind from Washington D.C. 

00:12:50
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:12:50
 Mildred and my roommate also mentioned the same name just a few minutes later. 

00:12:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Could people pick up your thoughts at a distance at all? 

00:12:55
  I'm not sure if they could or not. 

00:13:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG Did you have the impression that, perhaps, they were picking your thoughts up? 

00:13:00
  Yes. 

00:13:05
DR. D. GOLDBERG Would that have been done with the transmitters in your teeth? 

00:13:05
 Ah, that's what I would think. 

00:13:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG That's what you thought. 

00:13:10
 Yes. 

00:13:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG Would they be sort of beaming out your thoughts? 

00:13:10
 Yes. 

00:13:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. And would other people need a transmitter or a receiver to pick them up or could they just pick them up with their brains? 

00:13:20
 I'll imagine they'd need some kind of mechanical device to pick it up. 

00:13:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. So, I'd like to make sure I've got this straight that the transmitters in your teeth would be beaming your thoughts out. (crosstalk) 

00:13:30
 Yes. 

00:13:30
DR. D. GOLDBERG But that other people with suitable devices could pick the thoughts up? 

00:13:35
 That's the way I always think. 

00:13:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG Sure. And maybe they could pick them up at quite a distance. (crosstalk) 

00:13:35
 Yeah. 

00:13:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG Say, you're several miles away? 

00:13:40
 Yes. 

00:13:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG So that your thoughts were no longer private in your own but could... (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
 Right. 

00:13:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG ...be picked up by other people. It must have been rather an alarming experience. 

00:13:45
 It was. 

00:13:45
DR. D. GOLDBERG  A feeling that you described to me when we met earlier about your thoughts being sort of beamed out of your head and other people being able to pick them up. 

00:14:00
 Right. 

00:14:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG Could you describe that to me in your own words? 

00:14:00
 Well, I had a sense of, uhm, people hearing my thoughts before I actually thought 'em myself. 

00:14:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. 

00:14:10
  Like they would be, it seemed that, as if they were reading the subconscious part of my mind before it actually came to my conscious thought. 

00:14:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Yes. So that all the people could pick your thoughts up, could they? 

00:14:25
  Right. 

00:14:30
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. Could they do that in a great distance or just people who were in the room with you? 

00:14:30
 At a great distance. 

00:14:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. And. 

00:14:35
 And some people. 

00:14:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG Did you have any instances of being certain that people had picked up your thoughts? 

00:14:40
 Yes. 

00:14:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. Did you find that a disturbing experience? 

00:14:40
  Yes, I did because it seemed to me that man's private thoughts should be his own and not, they shouldn't be, ah, heard by anyone else... (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:14:55
 ...except yourself. 

00:14:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:14:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG  The next symptom is thought insertion. The patient experiences thoughts, which have not got the quality of being his own. He often will give a delusional explanation by how thoughts have gotten to his head, which aren't his. Of course, it's rather similar to the made experiences we're just about to consider. It's a sort of made thought. We haven't a perfect example of this but here is a patient describing something very like it. 

00:15:30
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. Can they actually put thoughts into your head which are not your own? 

00:15:35
 Yes. 

00:15:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh-huh. What sort of thoughts do they put into your head? 

00:15:40
 Uhm, they're trying to (inaudible ). 

00:15:49
DR. D. GOLDBERG  The first of the made experiences are called somatic passivity. Some influence is thought to be playing on the body. The patient is a passive and invariably reluctant recipient of bodily sensations imposed on him by some outside agencies. The experiences he has can be abnormal feelings, perceptions or kinesthetic hallucinations. 

00:16:20
 Well, they don't give me headaches, not all the time, but sometime they put a, a heavy pressure... (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
  on my head. 

00:16:30
DR. D. GOLDBERG Do they? Uh hmm. 

00:16:30
 And my head get very dumb. 

00:16:30
DR. D. GOLDBERG I see. 

00:16:30
  Numb-like. 

00:16:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uhm. 

00:16:35
 It gets numb and they just get all the feelin' away from my head. 

00:16:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uhm. 

00:16:40
 I have no mind to think with, (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:16:40
 ...I've nothing to hold on to. 

00:16:45
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. That other thing you were just saying about when they make your skin darker. Can you tell that because the skin is going dark or because they make your voice say that the skin has gone dark? 

00:16:55
 No, because I can see, my leg is, I wouldn't say are very light. 

00:17:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG No. 

00:17:00
 But they're brighter than this. 

00:17:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG Sure. 

00:17:00
  And right now you can see how dark it is. 

00:17:05
DR. D. GOLDBERG Hmm. 

00:17:05
 How dark my legs is and my feet was changed. 

00:17:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG Really? 

00:17:10
 Instead, I have in my feet, I have some funny long toes. 

00:17:15
DR. D. GOLDBERG Really? Then. (crosstalk) 

00:17:15
 They're very funny. 

00:17:15
DR. D. GOLDBERG Have they done that to you? 

00:17:15
 That's right. 

00:17:15
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
  And she said that she wears my feet all the time. 

00:17:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG Oh, I see. 

00:17:20
 And she wears my body. 

00:17:25
DR. D. GOLDBERG So, like somebody else's feet you've got down there? 

00:17:25
 Yes, it is. 

00:17:25
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:17:25
 It is. 

00:17:25
DR. D. GOLDBERG  And the voices... (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
 I (inaudible ). 

00:17:31
DR. D. GOLDBERG Have done that to you? 

00:17:31
 but I real, my feet is very short. 

00:17:31
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:17:31
 And not very fat but is... (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:17:35
 ...slender. 

00:17:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. I see. (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
 And, ah. 

00:17:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG  So when you see that your toes have all gone long like that and that your skin has gotten darker. You reckon it must be the voices or they tell you it was the voices? 

00:17:45
 No, they tell me they're doing it. 

00:17:45
DR. D. GOLDBERG They tell you that they're doing it. 

00:17:50
 They tell me they're doing it. 

00:17:50
DR. D. GOLDBERG The next symptom are called "made feelings." The patient experiences feelings, which do not seem to be his own. The feelings are usually attributed to some external source that are imposed upon him. 

00:18:05
DR. D. GOLDBERG Apparently, the voices have actually made you hungry when you weren't hungry yourself. 

00:18:10
 That's right. 

00:18:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG Can you describe that to me? 

00:18:15
 Well, it's just like, uhm, you sit down on the table and eat a balanced diet. 

00:18:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:18:20
 And, ah, you, uhm, you feel full. 

00:18:25
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. 

00:18:25
 And, uhm, after you've eaten and you, you, after you've eaten, you, you know you, you have enough to eat, to eat. 

00:18:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:18:35
 Ah, the voice, it would make me hungry. 

00:18:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. 

00:18:35
 And tell me, so, well, go into the refrigerator and get whatever I have in there to eat. They would even name whatever they want me to, to consume. 

00:18:45
DR. D. GOLDBERG So they can make you hungry even when you're not hungry. 

00:18:45
 That's right. 

00:18:45
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Yeah. 

00:18:50
 And, ah, they can make me feel full. 

00:18:50
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. 

00:18:50
 When I'm not, when I'm hungry, I'm supposed to be hungry. They make me feel like I don't need anything to eat. 

00:18:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. See, is that the only thing they've done that to you with hunger? What about sexual feelings or thirst or sleepiness? Do, do they have alter the way you feel in any of those other respects? 

00:19:10
 Yes, very mu, especially sleeping. 

00:19:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:19:10
 I always feel like they can make me go to sleep just about any time they feel like, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG Even when you're not sleepy? 

00:19:20
 That's right. 

00:19:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG So, you're not sleepy but they can actually make you sleepy? 

00:19:25
 Yes. 

00:19:25
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. 

00:19:25
 That's correct. 

00:19:25
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Did these transmitters ever the way they used to give you particular feelings? Did you have feelings that weren't your own rather than this pressures in your head? 

00:19:35
 I could be extremely emotional. 

00:19:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:19:35
 (inaudible ) 

00:19:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. What sort of emotions would they be? 

00:19:40
 Mostly sadness. 

00:19:45
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:19:45
 (inaudible ) 

00:19:46
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. And even when you weren't sad yourself, the transmitters could make you feel sad, could they? 

00:19:50
 I guess so. 

00:19:50
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh-huh. Could they do anything else? Could they make you hungry? 

00:19:55
 Uhm, I don't know if they ever did or not. 

00:19:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG  No. It was just sadness that you remember. 

00:20:00
 Yes. 

00:20:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG And it was a feeling that it was being done to you rather than you we're feeling sad... (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
 Yes. 

00:20:05
DR. D. GOLDBERG ...because you're being made to feel sad, is that right? 

00:20:10
 Yes. 

00:20:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG The next symptom are made impulses. A powerful impulse overcomes the patient to which he almost invariably gives way. The impulse to carry up the action is not felt to be his own, but the actual performance of the act is. In the next example, we will hear of a patient who does not feel that the actions of his left arm were due to him. Sometimes patients with this sort of experiences will mutilate themselves, acting on an impulse which they do not consider to be their own. 

00:20:50
DR. D. GOLDBERG Now, I'm not, a completely different problem that you had that I wanted you to tell me about was that time when your, your arm had an impulse to do something which you actually didn't want to do. 

00:21:05
 Right. 

00:21:05
DR. D. GOLDBERG Tell me all about that, could you? 

00:21:05
 Well, it was at work one night at the nightclub and I was in charge of running the lights and the music. My, and, my left arm kept wanting me to smash up the equipment. 

00:21:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:21:20
 And I didn't wanna do it than I had to. I was very agitated and nervous. I just sat down in the chair and stuck my hand in my coat pocket... (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
 To keep it from doing it because it seem to be moving on its own accord. 

00:21:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. It wasn't you that was making it move? 

00:21:40
  No. 

00:21:45
DR. D. GOLDBERG No. But without wishing to go into any details, sometimes they'd suggest things that you felt that you had to do that... (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
 Right. 

00:21:50
DR. D. GOLDBERG ...the rest of you didn't want to do. 

00:21:50
  Right. 

00:21:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. So they must have had a very compelling quality? 

00:21:55
 Right. 

00:21:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Yeah. Okay. 

00:22:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG The next symptom are called made acts. The patient experiences some of his actions as being completely under the control of an external influence. The movements are initiated and directed throughout by the controlling influence and the patient may feel that he automaton, the passive observer of his own actions. 

00:22:25
DR. D. GOLDBERG And you reckoned that the transmitters are being put there by your dentist, you were telling me before. 

00:22:30
 Yes. 

00:22:30
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Yes. Now, what effect did these transmitters have on you? 

00:22:35
  Well if, if it was any kind of effect at all, it was a mostly a good effect. 

00:22:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Uh hmm. 

00:22:45
 And, and, uhm, I'll leave here and go downtown for some work. 

00:22:50
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. 

00:22:50
 I said I'd feel the pressure on the left side of my head, meaning you turn left, or in the right, mean turn on the right. 

00:22:55
DR. D. GOLDBERG I see. So you experience the pressure in your left cheek? (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
 No, it was in my head not. (crosstalk) 

00:23:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG It's in your head? 

00:23:00
 Yes. 

00:23:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG I see. And it will be on the left side of your head. 

00:23:00
 Yes. 

00:23:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG  And if you experience that pressure that would make you turn left, would it? 

00:23:05
 Well, I was using that for a signal. 

00:23:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. 

00:23:10
 And nobody actually tell me that, I just sort of... (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG No. 

00:23:10
 ...but it came up with. (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG  You felt you were under control? 

00:23:15
 Yes. 

00:23:15
DR. D. GOLDBERG And similarly, if you felt that pressure on the right side of your head, that made you turn right. 

00:23:20
 Yes. I look to the right. 

00:23:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Yes. And so you were controlled by these transmitters? 

00:23:25
 Yes. 

00:23:25
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. Did you have any theories at the time as to who was doing the controlling? 

00:23:30
 No. Uhm, well, I feel that it must have been somebody that was watching the vehicle I was driving. I was pretty close by to move... (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG I see. 

00:23:40
 ...where I was. 

00:23:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes, yes. Did they control the way you drove the vehicle? 

00:23:45
 Uhm, no, sir, not exactly. 

00:23:45
DR. D. GOLDBERG No. No. 

00:23:45
  I was tryin' to drive within the speed limits. 

00:23:50
DR. D. GOLDBERG Of course you do, of course you do. What about when you turn the vehicle to the left? Were you made to do that? You've got the pressure on the left side? 

00:23:55
 Well, I just felt the pressure on the left side when I turned left. 

00:24:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG And that would make you turn the vehicle left? 

00:24:00
 Yes. 

00:24:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG So when you were walking, you're walking was controlled by the pressures and when you were driving that would control the way you drove the vehicle? 

00:24:10
 Yes. 

00:24:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG Sure. 

00:24:10
  Would, and that's how they put words in my mouth also. 

00:24:15
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. 

00:24:15
 Make me say things when... (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. 

00:24:20
 ...ah, I don't mean to use these type of languages they use. 

00:24:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Can you give me an example of that? 

00:24:25
 Oh, well, that's a bad, real bad, uh experience. Uhm, like you and I are talking right now, I might say something very vulgar to you. 

00:24:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes, sure. 

00:24:35
 Or in a, a nasty manner. 

00:24:35
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Uhm. 

00:24:40
 And I, I, I would catch that. And I knew it wasn't me because my personality is not really like that. 

00:24:45
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uhm. Uhm. 

00:24:45
 See, this is how I can, ah, I think I held out as long as I have. 

00:24:50
DR. D. GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:24:50
 Ah, because I can determine, I mean, I could de, detect whom, well, ah, when the voices come in. 

00:25:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. 

00:25:00
 And talk to me. 

00:25:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yes. 

00:25:00
 And I try to fight them off the best way I know how. 

00:25:05
DR. D. GOLDBERG If they were to do that now, would I be able to tell it was the voices or would it just to me seem as though it was your voice? 

00:25:10
 No. It seem like, uhm, 'coz it wanna sound like me, really. 

00:25:10
DR. D. GOLDBERG  It would sound. (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
 It would, they would try to imitate me. 

00:25:15
DR. D. GOLDBERG They would, wouldn't they. Would they succeed, so, would I be fooled? 

00:25:20
 Yes, you could... (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. 

00:25:20
 ...easily. 

00:25:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG Yeah. 

00:25:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG  The last symptom is called delusional perception. Schneider described the delusional perception as a two-stage phenomenon. The delusion arises from a perception, which to the patient possesses all the properties of a normal perception and which he acknowledges would be regarded as such by anyone else. The perception, however, has a private meaning for him and the second stage, which is the development of the delusion, follows almost immediately. The crystallization of an elaborate delusional system following upon the percept is often very sudden. 

00:26:00
DR. D. GOLDBERG A patient described delusional perception to me this morning that he was too sick to come to the studio and tell you about it himself. He was going for a walk with his dog three weeks ago as he had done everyday for 14 years. But something about the way in which the dog was following him seemed peculiar that day. It suddenly came to him that the dog was a lesbian, probably a Nazi agent, and it had a transmitter implanted in its brain that was beaming out and telling everybody in Charleston just where the patient was going. The only thing for it was to kill the dog, so he drowned it. 

00:26:40
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Schneider described all other abnormal forms of experience, all other sorts of hallucinations, all other delusions as what he calls second rank symptoms. Feelings of perplexity, delusional notions, by which he means a delusion which is possible to understand. Abnormal moods, flat affect, catatonic phenomena; these are all second rank symptoms. If only these symptoms are present, Schneider says the diagnosis depends wholly on the coherence of the total clinical picture. 

00:27:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG Catatonic phenomena, a second rank symptom of schizophrenia, in the excerpts I'm about to show you, you're going to see two such phenomena. One of these is called waxy flexibility. You'll see me put the little boy's arms and fingers into uncomfortable and unnatural postures. And you'll see that the little boy will stand and keep those postures even though I tell him he doesn't need to keep his hands like that and he can rest more comfortably. It's important that you remember to do that because, otherwise, suggestible people will think that the doctor must have had a good reason for putting their hands in a funny position and they keep them there just out of politeness. But in this phenomenon, the patient will maintain abnormal positions often for hours or days. An associated phenomenon is called automatic obedience. With an adult, it's usually elicited by holding out your right hand as though you are to shake hands with him. The patient emerges from his stupor and his right hand comes out to meet yours. If you withdraw your hand just before the two hands meet, the patient's hand goes back, too, and you can keep this up for as long as you like. The patient's hand will seemed to be connected to yours as though by invisible wires and this is the only movement you can get out of the patient, automatic obedience. With this little boy, shaking hands isn't in his behavioral repertoire, but catching balls is. He catches a lot of them when he's well and playing in the streets around Charleston. You'll see that when I throw him a ball, he emerges from his abnormal position and catches it, but then freezes again until the stimulus is repeated. So, waxy flexibility and automatic obedience. 

00:29:20
[sil.] 

00:29:20
DR. D. GOLDBERG  You can put your hands by your side and stand comfortably, John. 

00:29:30
[sil.] 

00:29:30
DR. D. GOLDBERG  Sit down, John. 

00:29:40
  John, sit in the chair. John, sit down. Yeah, you won't fall. Go ahead and sit. John, sit in the chair. You won't fall. Sit in the chair. The chair is right there.
