Understanding Play Behavior and Themes in Play Therapy 

00:00:00
Dr. Garry Landreth Distinguished Contributor to Play Therapy 

00:00:00
NARRATOR This hour long training session was a part of one of Dr. Landreth's two day workshops on making contact with children through play therapy. In this video, Dr. Landreth explores the meaning in children's play, identifies the four messages revealed in children's play, describes the stages in the play therapy process and how to read or identify theme development in children's play. He also examines the difficult issue of confidentiality in play therapy. Dr. Garry Landreth is a regents professor and founder and director of the Center for Play Therapy at the University of North Texas, the largest play therapy training program in the world. Dr. Landreth is internationally recognized as one of the foremost spokesman for and developer of the child centered approach to play therapy. He has pioneered child center play therapy training in international settings such as China, Korea and South Africa and is a frequent conference speaker and workshop presenter throughout the United States. Dr. Landreth's over 100 publications and videos include his book, Play Therapy the Art of the Relationship, which is widely considered to be the authoritative source on Child Centered play therapy and has been published in Chinese, Korean and Russian. His video, Child Centered Play Therapy a Clinical Session demonstrates his approach to play therapy. 

00:01:30
GARRY LANDRETH Some elements typical of play behavior and this is not something you'll need to take a lot of extensive notes on, I just want to review for you what you've already studied in child development and this will serve as a reminder for what we do in the play room with the children and a reminder about the meaning of their play. 

00:01:55
Elements Typical of Play Behavior 

00:01:55
Play is pleasurable. 

00:01:55
GARRY LANDRETH Play is pleasurable, therefore, stay out of it. You don't need to try to make it more so. It's already pleasurable enough for the child. You don't need to add to it. It's already complete enough the way the child is doing it. Don't mess up the child's play. The child should be allowed to stay in the lead with their play. They are doing what is important to them and should be doing what is important to them. Not what is important to us. 

00:02:35
Elements Typical of Play Behavior 

00:02:35
Play is spontaneous, voluntarily chosen, and non-goal directed. 

00:02:35
GARRY LANDRETH Second dimension, play is spontaneous, voluntarily chosen, and non-goal directed. True play does not have a goal or an objective. In play it is the process that is important, not the product. Our achieving the goal for children it is the process of engaging in the play that is sufficient for the children and they typically do not have a goal. If we choose for children the play, than is it play? Not if we have chosen it because true play is chosen by the child, it's something they voluntarily do. Many of the things that we call children's play in life, soccer, little league baseball, is that play? I wonder about that. You can't do on the little league baseball field what you would like to do. You can't hit the ball and run to third base. If you do that very many times you won't stay on the team. You can't change the rules as you go along but in play you make up the rules as you go along. You don't fit some adult prescribed rules as happens in much of children's play where they must abide by the rules that adults thought of. For children, the rules aren't important until they think of a rule and then they are ready to change it two minutes later. 

00:04:25
Elements Typical of Play Behavior 

00:04:25
Play is self directed creative self expression. 

00:04:25
GARRY LANDRETH Play is self directed creative self expression. That's an important dimension to keep in mind about your time with the child in the play room. Is what this child is doing here self directed? If not it's probably not play. Is what the child is doing coming from the child's own creative self expression? If not, it's probably not play. And if we're going to be in touch with the child's world it means we must create the kind of environment that allows children to create their play and through the play to express themselves and their world. 

00:05:10
Elements Typical of Play Behavior 

00:05:10
Play is intrinsically complete. 

00:05:10
It does not depend on external rewards or other people. 

00:05:10
GARRY LANDRETH Play is intrinsically complete. It does not depend on external rewards or other people. You don't need to pat a child on the back to encourage them to play. You don't need to pat them on the head and say good job playing in order for them to feel good about their play. It is intrinsically complete in and of itself. You don't need to add to it. You don't need to suggest how it should be done. You don't need to suggest what color should be used. 

00:05:50
Elements Typical of Play Behavior 

00:05:50
Play behavior does not occur in new, unusual, or frightening situations. 

00:05:50
GARRY LANDRETH Play behavior does not occur in unusual, or frightening situations. That's an important dimension to be aware of in the first session or two with the child. Just because the child comes into the play room and does not play does not mean this child does not need the play room. Many beginning play therapists make the mistake of bringing a child perhaps seven years old or eight years of age into the play room and the child sits down and carries on the most adult of conversations and then the play therapist assumes, "Oh this child doesn't need the play room." But could it be that this is a highly anxious child? How many of you all know adults who try to cover up their anxiety by talking a lot? Children do the same thing. I was just thinking of a child, who came to the play room, he was eight years of age. He had, uh, announced to his second grade teacher, um, there's no use learning anything. You just grow up and find out it's no longer true. Argue with that. How many of you have grown up to find out what you were told wasn't true? He just quit. This was a very bright child had somewhere above 135 IQ. He would sign his name to sheets of paper. Other times he would just turn it in completely blank, that's all he would do. So he was referred to me for play therapy. He came into the lay room and sat down and for the first session, carried on the most adult of conversations. One of the things that he talked a lot about was astronauts and being up there, what could happen. He had a very vivid imagination. This was several years ago before we sent men and women up together and this child was already thinking of that. And he had a very vivid imagination about what men and women could do in space and he discussed those possibilities. Now and then he would pause, look around the room and make comments like, "I guess some children play with this stuff, huh?" to which I said, "Sounds like maybe you're wondering if it would be OK if play with the toys." To which he said, "That's just baby stuff." to which I said, "Oh, you think the toys are just for babies." That is an empathic response to a thought. See to just reflect back to him, "Oh, that's just for babies." Is perhaps is to confirm something that is not true. That's his thought about the toys. He would, went through the whole first session without getting out of his chair. He talked and talked and talked. In the second session, he talked and talked and talked. In the third session, oh I should give you just another statement about this child's background so that you can understand perhaps why he's so verbal. His father is a University history professor and, um, this child, uh, had lead almost a rigid adult kind of life. One of the happenings in his life was one day at school he had swapped his lunch for a comic book, brought the comic book home, was reading the comic book when Dad came in and Dad saw the comic book, grabbed it, ripped it to shreds, threw it in the trashcan, grabbed one of his University college history textbooks, put it in his son's hand and said, "If you're gonna read something, read something important." Well the child could read the University history book. But that's the kind of rigid life this child had lived. So to come into a play room where you're free to play would cause great anxiety and did for this child. In the third session he began to play a little bit. In the fourth session he played more. In the fifth session, this child is lying in my sandbox. In my play therapy rooms I have, we have large play therapy rooms we have a big sandbox and they've got lots of sand, large enough for a child to get in and lay down, this child is lying on his back, fiddling his fingers in the sand, looking up at the ceiling saying, "Some teachers think the most important thing in the world is what goes on in their classroom. That's just not true. Most important thing in the world is what goes on in places like this." Isn't that a wonderful testament for play therapy? When children don't interact with the toys look for anxiety. Look for anxiety. It may not mean that they don't need the play room at all. In fact I believe all children need the play room, at least until about age 11. It's not until children are about 11 years of age according to Pia Jays[sp] research that they're able to engage fully in abstract reasoning and thinking and what are words made up of? Symbols that somebody thought of. And then somebody put some meaning into those symbols. Words are great abstractions and so we restrict children when we ask them to communicate on the basis of verbal language. That is not natural for children. Play is natural for children so in play therapy we think of the words as being like, I'm sorry, as the toys as being like the child's words. And play is the child's language. So our job as a play therapist is to understand the child's play language. Not to restrict the child to some verbal language. You see that is to ask the child to come up to my level of communication, and what is the rule of thumb? We must go to the child's level and communicate with children on their level and their level is a play language not a verbal language. 

00:12:35
Elements Typical of Play Behavior 

00:12:35
Play is highly variable across situations and across children. 

00:12:35
GARRY LANDRETH Play is highly variable both across situations and across children. I am not one of those play therapists who believes that all play means the same thing. That for every child, if a child picks up a certain item out of the toys that always means the same thing. My experience is otherwise. That play is highly variable across situations and across children. A five year old girl comes into the play room, sits in the sandbox, spreads her legs out, begins to scoop a hole in the sand and then in that process she scoops up sand over her groin area. And this is perhaps a classic example of a child who has been abused and the need to cover up or cleanse. Another five year old girl sits in the same sandbox, her legs are straddled out, she too digs a hole in the sand and in the process, she too covers up her groin area and what it means is she is digging a hole in the sand, that's all. Same play behavior but an entirely different meaning so we must be careful about jumping to conclusions about children's experiences based on isolated play events. You must be very cautious about that and we'll talk later this morning about how to read themes in children's play as a way to understand what the message is so that we don't get on the wrong track by just looking at an isolated event. When children play in the play therapy experience there are four messages that I generally am looking for. 

00:14:30
Child's Play will reveal 

00:14:30
What child has experienced 

00:14:30
GARRY LANDRETH I believe that this child's play will reveal what this child has experienced. Somewhere in this child's play what this child has lived out or lived through in their life will be revealed in their play it will be portrayed in the play in some way. It may not happen in the first session it may not even be revealed in the second session, maybe in little pieces and you look back and you see the theme in the play and then you go ah ha, I see the message in this child's play. So we look into the play for the child's experiences to be portrayed to us. 

00:15:10
Child's Play will reveal 

00:15:10
What child has experienced 

00:15:10
Child's feelings or reactions 

00:15:10
GARRY LANDRETH The second message I look for in the child's play is that the play will reveal the child's feelings or reactions about that experience. I don't expect children to verbalize their feelings or their reactions. I don't ask children how they reacted to an event or a happening or how that made them feel. It's my job to understand what their communicating in their play about their feelings and their reactions to experiences or events in their lives. 

00:15:45
Child's Play will reveal 

00:15:45
What child has experienced 

00:15:45
Child's feelings or reactions 

00:15:45
What child needs in his/her life 

00:15:45
GARRY LANDRETH I believe that children's play will reveal what children need in their lives. Recently I was observing a four year old child in the play room working with one of my graduate students and as I watched this child play he spent what seemed to be to me an inordinate amount of time cooking and preparing food. And it's not that little boys don't do that, they do that a lot in my play rooms, but this child just seemed to be too intently focused on fixing preparing foods and as I watched this child it began to occur to me that this was this child's expression of a need for nurturing in his life. In that the food was a symbolic representation of the nurturing this child needed. Later when I had the opportunity to meet the mom I discovered this was a very cold mother and then I could see why the child might be portraying what he had been portraying in the play room. So we look for the play to reveal to us what the child needs in his life. 

00:17:05
Child's Play will reveal 

00:17:05
What child has experienced 

00:17:05
Child's feelings or reactions 

00:17:05
What child needs in his/her life 

00:17:05
Child's self concept 

00:17:05
GARRY LANDRETH I think the fourth message that will generally show up in children's play is a message about the child. How they feel about themselves. You can watch a child play and form fairly accurate perceptions about this child's self esteem or self concept as you watch the child interact in the play room you get a feeling from this child and that sometimes will be more revealing to you than any test you could give to the child. 

00:17:35
Child's Play will reveal 

00:17:35
What child has experienced 

00:17:35
Child's feelings or reactions 

00:17:35
What child needs in his/her life 

00:17:35
GARRY LANDRETH So there are these four messages that we're always looking for in the play therapy experience. What the child has experienced will be shown in his play, or their play will reveal to us their feelings, reactions about that experience or what they need in their life or how they feel about themselves. I was just reminded in terms of the child's play behavior and the meaning in the child's play of a five year old child that I was watching through a two way mirror. Folks in my play therapy program at the University of North Texas I have eight fully equipped play therapy rooms and they all have color video cameras and all of my graduate students had the opportunity to observe all of their sessions on video tape. I don't think they initially look at that as an opportunity but they get used to that, there are two way mirrors everywhere. Everybody is being watched and videotaped and so I'm behind the two way mirror watching this five year old who had been referred to us because she was biting other children in the kindergarten and parents don't like that. She had bitten the kindergarten teacher also. Parents described this five year old as difficult to manage. That means that she wasn't doing what she was supposed to do at home they were having trouble with discipline problems and she was waking up at night frightened. Now I think any one of those behaviors we could take care of fairly quickly if we just focused on correcting the behavior but in play therapy it's important that we trust the child to lead us to where they need to be. Not where we think this child should be. You see, we have some problems here to focus on, that is the biting behavior, the discipline problems and the waking up at night frightened. I think each one of those could be taken care of fairly quickly, we can do some things in the kindergarten setting to extinguish the biting behavior. We can teach the parents some disciplining procedures and the waking up at night frightened might take a little bit longer but there is some things we can focus on there to probably take care of that problem. But in the process of taking care of the problem we can lose sight of the child and the child's needs. And if we would trust the child the child will take us in their play to where they need to be which may be different than we have any idea about where they need to be. Folks I'm not one of those people who thinks I know where children need to be or what they need to work on or what they need to accomplish in the play room. I am not wise enough to know what another person should be working on, certainly not what this child should be working on. I'm not like God, I don't know everything and I accepted that a long time ago. My objective with children in the play room is to discover that which I don't know, that I don't even know I don't know. See I'm not going to get lost in what somebody else is concerned about. That is the known . What is not known? That is what I'd like to know about this child, what nobody else knows about this child. As I was watching this five year old, she came into the play room this was about the third or fourth session and she went over to the Fisher Price medical kit, took out the syringe, came over and said to the play therapist, "Take off your shirt I'm gonna give you a shot." And my doctoral student I thought very appropriately said, "My shirt's not for taking off, you can pretend the doll is me." And she pointed to the adult female doll. "You can pretend the doll is me and take the doll's shirt off." and she said, "Oh, OK." Like, "I hadn't thought of that." Which she hadn't. And she went over, picked up the doll, took the shirt off, but didn't stop with that. She completely undressed this adult female doll, took the syringe and acted out a very explicit sexual act, and I was watching that scene, I thought a five year old is not born knowing how to do that that way. This child had to have experienced that either by seeing it or directly experiencing, one way this child has been abused. She wasn't born knowing what that behavior is like. This was a child who had been sexually abused and nobody knew. Well, one adult knew, the perpetrator. The parents did not know, the kindergarten teacher did not know. Now what would have happened in this child's life if we had focused on correcting the biting problem, correcting the discipline problem, trying to take care of the waking up at night frightened. We could have taken care of those and the cause of those behaviors might have been locked away forever inside this child. Do you see what I mean by trusting that the child will take us in their play to where they need to be, not where I think they need to be, not where the kindergarten teacher or the parents think they need to be. But trusting the child's wisdom to take us to where they need to be. There is meaning in children's play if we will look for the meaning and if we will look through the child's eyes. Play therapy is not a mechanical technique focused experience. It is a relationship with the child individually or sensitive to what's going on inside the child. As children play out their experiences in this relationship with us, there are certain stages that seems to me children go through in this process and I would like to share with you my model, my conception of what happens in the play therapy relationship. That children come to this relationship with this and they bring with them the abstract experiences which they do not understand, that is things in their life that seems strange to them or weird or that they just simply do not have a cognitive understanding of that experience and through their play they begin to play out these experiences that they don't understand. 

00:25:15
Concrete Play Abstract Bridges Gap 

00:25:15
GARRY LANDRETH The play is concrete, it's happening now, it's occurring now. The child is in charge of the play, that makes it concrete for the child. So play in this experience bridges the gap between that which the child does not understand and that which the child understands. As children play they begin to make meaning out of that which they don't' understand. That which they cannot control in reality can be controlled in their play. That which they don't understand in reality becomes understandable in their play as they have the play go in the direction they want the play to go as they have happenings happen in the way they want them to happen. They experience this feeling of being in control and that is an important dimension as children organize their experiences. 

00:26:15
Concrete Play Abstract Bridges Gap 

00:26:15
Child: Organizes Experiences 

00:26:15
GARRY LANDRETH As children are playing they are organizing their experiences into something that is understandable. And as they organize these experiences in the play room they feel more in control of their life because indeed at that moment they are in control of that part of their life. They may not be able to be in control of the part of life outside the play room but in the play room they can control this part of their life and that's a significant therapeutic dimension. A fellow named Seagal[sp] in the 19, goodness I've forgotten the date on that, it was 1979 I believe, interviewed 2,800 inner city children who covered the whole span of academic achievement and what they found was that the children who felt inc control of their experiences performed at higher academic levels, and that that was more important than the intellectual capacity. The children that did not feel in control of their experiences performed at lower academic levels. So we could expect some generalization to occur from the play room into the classroom, that is children experience feeling more in control at this part of their life, they go back into their classroom, they take that feeling of being in control to the classroom with them and they will perform at higher academic levels in the classroom. 

00:28:00

00:28:00
Child: Organizes Experiences 

00:28:00
Reorients Self to Present 

00:28:00
GARRY LANDRETH As children play they are reorienting themselves to the present. Play is present oriented. You cannot play in the future. You cannot play in the past. Once you start playing out the past, play is concrete, it is occurring now.

Reorients Self to Present 

00:28:30
Play Therapy: A living relationship 

00:28:30
GARRY LANDRETH So it brings the past into this present experience with the child and because of that play therapy then is viewed as a living relationship because the child is living this experience out right now, fully and they're able to live it out fully because of what is projected into the play. What is required for play? There must be some intellectual activity. There must be some emotional activity. There is physical activity. Indeed the total child is projected into his or her play so that children are living this out since they're totally involved, unlike other therapeutic experiences. Adults come in, teenagers come in, they sit and they talk about it but you never have the total person present with you in a talk situation because they're not acting it out physically and since they're not acting it out they're not living it out.

00:29:40
Freely Organizes Personal World 

00:29:40
GARRY LANDRETH Only partially are they living it out and that in their mind but in play therapy we have the total child present and available to us and so this becomes a living relationship in which the child is continuously, freely organizing his or her personal world to make their personal world be the way they want they want their world to be. To be in charge at this moment through the play.

Freely Organizes Personal World 

00:30:10
Continually: Discovers Self Anew 

00:30:10
GARRY LANDRETH As children play then it seems to me they are continually discovering self anew. Continually finding out something new about themselves and this is the purpose of play therapy. That the child would come to discover self anew. Some new dimensions of life and in that process experience what it feels like to be in control and then in that process to develop self control and self direction in life outside the play room. Then as we work with children in the play therapy relationship we look for themes in the child's play that helps us to understand what this child is working on, what direction they are taking in this relationship, where they are headed and a theme is something the child talks about several times, perhaps more than once in a session or each session this verbally comes up or it's something the child plays out more than once. Maybe it's several times within the same session or it occurs every session within the first five sessions you, this same play behavior occurs. That becomes a theme or it may be that the meaning in the play is the same across several sessions but the play behavior, the scene changes across sessions but the meaning, the underlying meaning remains basically the same across sessions. Those are themes and it's in recognizing the theme that we come to understand this is what this child is working on. So let me share with you some cases from play therapy. I'll describe the children's behaviors and they you share with me what you think this child's problem is or what this child had experienced in his or her life. This first child I'd like to share with you was two and a half years old. Can you see a two and a half year old in your mind's eye. She's just a tiny little person. She comes into the play room and she's very cautious. She walks over to the shelves and she touches items but she doesn't pick anything up. She just moves things a little bit, which is the child's way of getting acquainted, by touching and then we take them shopping with us and we say to the child, "Don't touch." Which is to say don't get acquainted with your world. But she's touching things, she doesn't pick anything up. She says not one word. Gradually works her way around the play room and some 10 minutes had passed when she finally arrives at the doll area. She picked up the baby doll, walked over to the sink, some of my play rooms have running water in the play room, and she turned the water on and she began to bathe this baby doll and as she's bathing the baby doll, the first words you would have heard from this two and a half year old's mouth were these, "No. No. Bad. Bad." And she begins to get agitated, her movements were more jerky and she's bathing this doll and she drops the doll in the sink with the water splashing on the doll and she steps back and she's staring intently at the doll in the sink and she begins to fling her hands and bounce. Have you seen toddler types do that when they have mixed emotions coursing through their body and they don't know how to express all of this any they bounce and she's flinging her hands and bouncing and she's staring into the sink and she comes back and she begins to just moan and deep emotions emerging from deep inside her body and then big old tears begin to just roll down her cheeks and she is just crying and weeping bitterly and saying, "No. No. Bad. Bad," and then she bathes and cries and if you could have seen this child you might have thought as I thought as I was watching that session, "My goodness, she's just gonna puddle up like a big old blob of Jello right in front of the sink there." Body was just racked with sobs and she's just crying and wailing and splashing the water and bathing. That activity went on for 15 minutes and she propped the doll in the sink and walked off and began to play in the room. Do you realize how long 15 minutes is in a two year old's life? Two year old's don't focus on anything for 15 minutes. This must have great emotional meaning for this child to stay focused for 15 minutes on that activity. The next week this child came into the play room, went straight to that same baby doll, picked up the baby doll, went to the sink, turned the water on, began to bathe this baby doll and again cried and moaned and groaned and sobbed and, "No. No. Bad. Bad." And bathed this baby and left the doll in the sink with the water running on the doll and went off and played after another 15 minutes. She repeated that behavior in the third session, the fourth session and the fifth session, these are once a week sessions, and then in the sixth session the behavior didn't even show up. What had this two and half year old experienced in her life? Makes some guesses. I don't expect you to be expert diagnosticians, not until 4:30 tomorrow afternoon. 

00:36:20
UNKNOWN A new baby. 

00:36:20
GARRY LANDRETH Perhaps there was a new baby born into the family and this was traumatic or threatening to this child in some way. What are the other possibilities? 

00:36:25
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:36:30
GARRY LANDRETH Perhaps this child had experienced severe potty training and the child's reacting to that. How many of you would agree that it's probably something that happened in the bathroom? There seems to be enough indication of that and so what are some other possibilities there? 

00:36:50
UNKNOWN A sexual something. 

00:36:50
GARRY LANDRETH There's a possibility, we see some indications or indicators here of sexual abuse in the bathing, the need to cleanse, there's some writing in the literature about that. Perhaps this child has been scalded. Taken to the bathroom, run hot water, some of you all may know of such cases where the adult sopped the child into the hot water as a way of teaching that child a lesson so they would never do that again. Nobody knows exactly how it happene, we know what happened. One afternoon while mom was taking a nap, this two and a half year old managed to get her six month old baby brother out of his room, down the hallway, into the bathtub and she turned the water on and she was just gonna do what she had seen Mom do hundreds of times and that is to have fun with this infant, to play with this infant. When you're two years old, three years old, infants are often viewed as play things and they have to be reminded, "She's a person just like you are, not a toy" but she was just gonna play like she's seen Mom play with this infant many times in the bathtub and the bathtub ran full of water and the six month old baby brother drowned. Now can there be meaning in children's play? Yes, there can be great meaning in children's play and folks there's absolutely no way that two and a half year old could have sat in a big chair like you're seated in and shared what she had experienced in her life. She doesn't really even know what she has experienced. Have you ever tried to explain death to a two year old? It can't be done. That's one of life's great abstractions. All she knows is, I haven't seen my baby brother in several days, and things are different in my home. My mom cries a lot, dad's angry a lot, that's what she knows but she doesn't really know about death but she came into the play room and did that what she could not verbally describe what had happened in her life. She played it out week after week after week and after five weeks she had played that out so that she did not need to go on with that. She had gotten what was in here out and Virginia Ashline[sp] says it's like taking a burden, when they play it out, it's like taking a burden and setting it aside and going on with life in a more positive and productive way. Let me share with you another case. This child was five years old and she was living with an elderly foster parent who died a natural death. The five year old was not present at the time of death so it was not traumatic to that extent. A lady in our community learned of this foster mother's death and came to child protective services and said, "When I was that child's age that lady was my foster mother and I would like to become this child's foster mother and continue what she started with this child in honor and memory of what she contributed to my life." So they worked out the details, she became the new foster mother. After living with this child three or four months, this new foster mother realized this wasn't working out very well. So she referred herself for counseling to our center. She came to the center and she went into an office with a counselor and the child went into the play room for her session. In the session with the foster mother the counselor gave her an assignment and the assignment was, you go home, this week, you find something to do with that five year old child that will be fun for both of you and when you come back next week I'm going to ask you what you did with that child that was fun for both of you to do. And the foster mother looked at him and said, "Have fun with her? I don't think you've been listening to me. I don't even like her." And this fellow was very insistent. He said, "You go home, you find something to do with that child that will be pleasurable for both of you and I'm going to ask you when you come back what it was you did." Next week they come back, she goes into her office, child goes in the play room. In the play room this child just immediately walked into the play room and went over to the sink and we have empty perfume bottle, there's soap there, there's a towel, there's a comb, brush, all those kinds of things are there and she began to arrange these items and get them just right. Have you ever noticed some children seem not to be able to get it just exact? They spend more time trying to get it organized than they do, and so she's trying to get it all fixed just right, she finally got it just right, she went over to the doll area, picked up the little girl doll has long flowing hair, brought the little girl doll over, turned the water on, stuck her head under the water, squirted soap all over the top of her head, began to lather it up and wash this doll's hair and in the process of washing the doll's hair she began to hum this most delightful little children's song. She was just caught up in what she was doing and she's washing her hair and singing this little children's song and she got her hair all lathered up and then rinsed all the soap out and go the towel and dried it off, took the brush and made her hair all poufy. I had a child once in play therapy say, "I'm gonna make her hair poufy." Made her hair all poufy and laid the little girl doll down and started to walk away, came back, picked up the doll, turned the water on, stuck her head under the water, squirted soap on top of her head, lathered that up, rinsed it out and continued to hum and sing this delightful little children's song, dried her hair off and made it all poufy again and laid the doll down. Would you like to guess what the foster mother was describing she did with this child next door in her session with the counselor? She said to the counselor, "Well I went home and I just racked my brain trying to think of something that I could do with this child that would be fun for both of us," and she said, "I remembered I used to enjoy washing people's hair." And she said, "Now you're gonna probably think that's kind of weird but it was fun for me to wash people's hair so I got in the kitchen there," and this was a very graphic lady, she said, "I got in the kitchen there and I got all this stuff down and I got it ready," and she did just like that as she described this. She said," I got all this stuff ready beside the sink there and I pulled the chair up in front of the sink and I got her up in the chair and I bent her head over there under the faucet," she said," you know I was washing that child's hair and I suddenly realized I was singing this little children's song that I didn't even know I had remembered." And she said, "That was just so much fun, washing her hair and singing this little children's song," she said, "I had so much fun doing that I did it twice." Can there be meaning in children's play? There can be great meaning in children's play. Let me tell you about Ben. Ben was five years old, came into the play room, went straight to the sandbox, crouched down beside the sandbox, has not said one word, picked up a toy soldier, has the toy soldier go walking across the sand. The first sound you would have heard from Ben were these, "Quicksand." And he shoves the guy under the sand. And then he gets this startled expression on his face like, "What happened here." Have you noticed children get caught up in their own play? Like, "Gee this is weird." And he reaches over, keeps his eye right on that spot of quicksand and reaches over, gets another toy soldier, he's gonna make sure this guy is really safe. And he avoids that quicksand, gets past the quicksand, just past the quicksand spot there and he goes, and shoves this guy under the quicksand also, and he can't figure this out. Gets another toy soldier, leans way out, he's gonna make sure this guy's really safe and he goes walking across the sand, gets almost to the other side and he goes, "Quicksand." and this guy disappears too. Folks in 15 minutes, not one of my 30 toy soldiers made it across the sandbox. They all went, "Quicksand." and disappeared. And then Ben went off and played. Next week Ben came in, went to the sandbox, crouched down, picked up a sand scoop and dug some holes in the sand, some pits, and went over and got the, out of the doll house, the bendable doll figures, the mother, father and little boy doll figures, they're about this tall and he holds them together, starts out at point A here, walking across the sandbox, avoiding these holes and they unexpectedly slid into one of those pits and Ben got the most disgusted expression on his face and a deep sigh came out of his chest, his shoulders slumped and he was just really exasperated with that happening and he picked up one person, cleaned off, cleaned off the second, cleaned off the third, they go back to point A. They start across the sandbox, they slide into another hole, he gets exasperated all over again. He cleans them off, he starts again. In 15 minutes the family never made it across the sandbox and he left them in one of those pits where they had fallen and he went off and played. Third week, Ben comes in, goes straight to the sandbox, crouches down besides the sandbox, picked up two scoops, promptly announced, "This is the good shovel, this is the bad shovel." And together the good shovel and the bad shovel create a dike across the sandbox. The sand is damp so he's heaping it up, creates this dike. Gets it all smooth just across the top, just perfect and the bad shovel reached in and knocked a hole in the side of the dike. And the good shovel comes scurrying around and starts repairing that hole in the dike just barely gets it repaired and the bad shovel knocks a hole in the other side. Ben goes running around here, just gets started repairing this hole and the bad shovel knocks a hole in this side so he quickly finish that and runs around here . He ran himself back and forth around that sandbox repairing the holes until he was just physically exhausted. He's just panting, and there's a big gaping hole in the dike. And he left that there. He went over to the doll house, picked up the mother doll and the little boy doll and they go walking across the top of the sand dike and they fell into that hole and he left them there. What had Ben experienced in his life? 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN A tragedy at home. 

00:48:35
GARRY LANDRETH Some kind of tragedy. 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN An abusive father. 

00:48:35
GARRY LANDRETH An abusive father, what are the other possibilities? 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Death. 

00:48:40
GARRY LANDRETH Actually it's worse than death, it's called divorce. And the reason I say that is because it goes on, for the child, it can go on and on for years of custody battles and so forth. Let's go back and look at the cues here. The first happening is the soldiers walking across the sand and they encounter the quicksand and they disappear. What could that possibly imply? The unexpected, the surprise, you see quicksand would not be dangerous if you knew where it was but it's always portrayed as you don't know where it is and suddenly it sucks you under. There's also very symbolic about that too being quicksand as he had identifies it because the quicksand sucks you under and could it be that Ben was feeling sucked under by all the turmoil of the divorce. And then the next wekk he comes in and here are these pits and the family falls into these holes and then the next scene is mother and child fall into the hole. Who's the good shovel and who's the bad shovel? 

00:50:05
UNKNOWN The mom is the good one, the dad is the bad one. 

00:50:05
GARRY LANDRETH Who's together at the end? Mom and child and indeed that was the way it was. Mom shared later that she said, "My husband just came home from a business trip and just out of the clear blue announced, "I'm splitting. I'm leaving, I want a divorce." and she said, "Just bowled me over," she said, "I had no idea anything was going on." Folks, sometimes when you're in the middle of the of the experience you don't see the cues. It's only when you get past the experience and look back that you look back and say, "Gee there were some real obvious cues there." Which she could see in counseling later looking back, but at the time and so she said to her husband, "Well let's get ourselves into counseling not for our sake, at least for Ben's sake." And the father wouldn't have anything to do with that counseling stuff. She got herself into counseling twice a week. She was just devastated. She did convince him to go with her once and he said no more of that and he left. He was gone a couple months and then he was back for a couple of weeks and then he was gone for a month and then he was back for a month. The next six or eight months were just emotional chaos like that. So who's the bad shovel, you see Dad is knocking holes in this family by leaving. Do you see the symbolic meaning, the hole, the pit that the family kept falling into and at the end the bad shovel knocked a hole in the dike and mother and child fell into the hole created by father and were left there stuck with what father had created. Now let's go back and look at themes. In the first occurrence, this child played exactly the same scene of washing the baby doll week after week, an obvious theme. In this session with Ben, the meaning is similar but the scene is different each week. First time it's the quicksand, then it's the holes in the sand and then it's the dike but it's the same meaning of falling into, being sucked in the void or created by the absence of the father and so we look at the happening across sessions to help us to understand what the child is dealing with. Be cautious not to put too much meaning on any one isolated happening. You can never know, that might have been by accident. You need to see that experience, unless it is so strange and bizarre that you could truly say there is absolutely no way that is by accident or no way a child could have stumbled into that, they had to have experience that directly to know how to do it exactly that way. We need to spend a few minutes talking about confidentiality in our relationships with children and note taking. I usually have lots of questions about that, let me just start with the second issue first. It's helpful if you will record first in your notes, F-I-R-S-T-S. This is the first time this happened, this is the first time this hasn't happened with this child. For example we've had six sessions and the child has painted at the easel most of the time each session and now in this sixth session the child doesn't even touch the paint. Something is emotionally different now and that would go into your notes, this is the first time the child didn't paint with the paints and over time you will begin to see patterns develop among the firsts. This is the first time this child played close to me. This is the first time this child didn't play close to me. This is the first time this child didn't ask me for help sometime during the session. This is the first time the child played in the sandbox. This is the first time this child made a mess. This is the first time this child didn't make a mess. Do you get the idea? You note firsts, in your notes. You do not need to record, try to record description of every single thing the child does in the play room. That just is too time consuming. Record the things that you notice first and unexpected happenings. as well as what you might consider significant happenings, that the child did this. You want to make note of that in your notes. It is not helpful to take notes or attempt to take notes during the play therapy session. When I first started doing play therapy which was a long time ago, I had read about taking notes during the session so that's what I did. But I noticed some interesting things happening. I would start recording something the child did the child wasn't here anymore. The child was over there and I realized I had missed everything that happened from there to there. And that began to puzzle me, what happened from here to here. I also noticed that I did not write down everything the child did in the room and I noticed that children noticed that I did not everything and some of the things I wrote down I never saw again. The child quit doing that because I wrote it down. The final event that convinced me that I should not be taking notes, I was working with this six year old. We'd had I think about five sessions together. I have my note tablet, I'm taking notes. He walked over and started trying to read my notes and I just handed him my tablet because people can't read my writing anyway. He took my tablet , laid it on the table, got the cup of black tempera paint, came over and painted the whole page. I have not taken a note since. That was years ago, I learned a good lesson from that child that notes were interfering, note taking was interfering with our relationship. I think a good rule of thumb is to write down enough about this session that you could report on it in to a judge or to a lawyer if you had to. But don't get compulsive about it. You can't record everything. That just takes and it's not needed. I have a friend who does play therapy in private practice and when he takes the child down to the waiting room he leaves the child, comes back by his office, he picks up a voice activated tape recorder, clips it on his belt, goes into the play room and while he is straightening up the play room getting ready for the next session he talks his notes. And when he can't think of something to say, the tape recorder stops running because it's voice activated so at the end of the day it's all condensed and he then works his notes out of what he has talked into the voice activated tape recorder. And I think that is a neat way, it saves you lots of time to get your notes down the way you need them. In relationship to the issue of confidentiality it is so easy to violate children's confidentiality and it's done I think often without any maliciousness at all it just, there paintings are delightful and so they're just shown. But that is a violation of the child's confidentiality. If you post the child's drawings in your play room and other children come in you have violated that child's confidentiality or if you put children's drawings out in the hallway they are beautiful and attractive but that's a violation of the child's confidentiality. Think about it folks. You would never transcribe a session with an adult and hang the transcript in the hallway. Nor would you hang the transcript on the wall of your office. Why should we put children's drawings on the wall of our office or of the hallway. Both are a violation of confidentiality. Also if you hang children's drawings on your play room wall or in your office, children come in they see the drawings and what's their reaction?

00:59:48
GARRY LANDRETH You're supposed to draw pictures in here that's what that message says and so they beautifully draw pictures in here and they might not have used the artwork at all. Had you not had the other children's paintings up. So we must be careful to make sure that what's in the play room from other children does not structure succeeding children so if a child puts a picture on the wall that's OK for now but as soon as that child leaves the pictures coming down. A child constructs a building of some kind in the sandbox as soon as the child leaves, that's going to be dismantled so that the next child who comes in will not be influenced by what's in the sandbox. A child draws a picture on the blackboard and I highly recommend you have a small blackboard in your office or your play area and some colored chalk. There's lots of creative things children will do with that but then you erase that at the end of each session, you don't leave anything up that will influence the next child. The question is how do you maintain the child's confidentiality but yet involve the parents in knowing things or teachers that they need to know to help this child, that they should know, and the general rule is that you don't reveal the specifics of the child's behavior in the play room. That's how you protect the child's confidentiality. But you talk about general areas. You would not say to the parents or to the teacher, "Boy you wouldn't believe how angry Robert is. He just beat the daylights out of Bobo." What you would talk about is, "Robert seems to be very angry." We've got to general issue here. I don't reveal how it is I came to that conclusion and then I would proceed from that to how does he express his anger at home or how does this child express anger in the classroom or is that a problem in the classroom. I want to find that out also. Does that help? Question is, do you instruct parents not to ask the child questions about what went on? Yes, in the initial parent interview when we're explaining about play therapy we talk about play and toys or their words, we go through all of that. We take the parent down to the play room, we show them the setting and then we give our parents a brochure that instructs them about how to respond to the child exactly how to respond. It says things like, "When the child comes out of the play room, down to the waiting room where you are, you are to say to your child, "Hi, we can go home now."" and if you're not that specific, they will mess up. And we also caution them, "Don't ask your child questions about what they did in the play room. They will tell you, "We played." just like you're right here talking to me, when you get home, if you're husband says "What did you all do?" you will say, "We talked." And your child will say, "We played." So yes those cautions are very appropriate. You need to caution parents about how to react to children's drawings when they walk down from the waiting room and they've got a painting in their hand and we instruct them to say, "I see you painted. You used some green and some blue and some red. We can go home now." Otherwise the parents will mess the process up. They'll say things like, "That's a dumb looking painting." or, "Why did you use all black?" and they say all awful things that will undo the process so you need to be very careful so we have it written down for them. We put it in their hands to take away about how to respond to the child.
