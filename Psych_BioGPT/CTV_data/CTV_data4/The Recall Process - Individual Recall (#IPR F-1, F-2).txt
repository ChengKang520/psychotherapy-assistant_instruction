RECALL SESSION 

00:01:00
MARK  'Coz I have these schedules, this is all I need. 

00:01:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:01:15
MARK And you said, no. 

00:01:15
 Yeah, but that's true, ki(ph), I, I think you want that have to... (crosstalk) 

00:01:20
MARK I am. 

00:01:20
 ...reschedule because that's a cop out for your responsibility. And that's less that you had to be responsible for it, that's, that's few us teachers, ah. 

00:01:25
MARK  When he said that, you know, I think I don't wanna have this schedule because ah, you have a lot of responsibility, I knew at that moment, he was right, but I didn't want to admit it. 

00:01:40
 Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:01:40
MARK Saying I can't admit that. Told him no way. 

00:01:45
 Perhaps you need to be responsible with the kids that you're around. You know, (crosstalk) 

00:01:50
MARK That maybe true but. 

00:01:50
 here, here I should take my subjects to my own little bag and get out of here. 

00:01:55
MARK And I said that maybe true. I actually, thought it was a bunch of baloney. I didn't think no way that's true. 

00:02:00
 Uh hmm. So you really weren't agreeing with him then? 

00:02:05
MARK No. I, I agree with him. But... (crosstalk) 

00:02:05
 Uh huh. 

00:02:05
MARK ...inside, (crosstalk) 

00:02:05
 Inside. 

00:02:05
MARK  I was... (crosstalk) 

00:02:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:02:10
MARK ...totally in an upset side of him. I didn't like what he was saying and... (crosstalk) 

00:02:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:02:10
MARK  usually, that's not true, I mean like, 'coz I'm not trying to gain anythin' special by telling any of my friends. 

00:02:20
 Uh hmm. But do you recall what you were feeling inside, Mark? 

00:02:20
MARK  At that moment? 

00:02:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:02:25
MARK I was feeling, well, you know, I'm agreeing with him, I don't really, ah, I don't want to agree with him but I am anyway. 

00:02:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:02:35
  You know, well, you're put, putting her in a bind again, here she tries to go along with you, get you to come along with the class and adapt to the class and tries to get you and then use your abilities, so that you can really benefit educationally. 

00:02:50
MARK "Why doesn't she tell me this?" That's what I was thinking and why doesn't she tell me, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:02:55
 Hmm. (inaudible ) 

00:02:58
MARK might be a little easy to me, easy for me to work with her if I know I'm supposed to be. I never noticed that in special ways that she was telling us. I've never noticed she was trying to work with me in any certain special way. 

00:03:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:03:10
MARK I've never noticed either. What I've noticed I'm a little bit of a stand out in the class but I've never noticed that I get away with so much more than the other students. 

00:03:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:03:20
MARK Some of these like college students never do it and I do it, it's not that I get way with it. 

00:03:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:03:25
  If I would give(ph) you some leeways, you take advantage with the leeways, then she gets pressure from the kids. And all because she had certain rules that she expects the kids to function by. What for, why do you wanna do that? What, what causes that, that you continually take advantage of the situations? 

00:03:45
MARK  I don't know. I guess that's just normal. I mean, like say, there's a little boy, he's not very smart and he's got $5 and I got $1 then, say, he says I'll trade you my $5 for your $1. Then, you know, maybe I tried to get him to trade $1 for $10 or... (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:04:05
MARK ...just something like that it's normal inside of me to try to take advantage of a good situation. 

00:04:10
 Yeah, but don't you end being a lose, loser in that way? 

00:04:15
MARK Not all the time. 

00:04:15
 You don't see yourself as losing. 

00:04:20
MARK No, I don't see myself is losing. 

00:04:20
MARK  At that time, I feel, maybe Mr. Hans(ph) was trying to make me feel like a loser and I was doing something so terribly wrong. 

00:04:30
 Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:04:30
MARK (inaudible ) recognize that that was being a problem. And all of a sudden, she tells me I got to go to the library and right now, I'm no longer in her class. (crosstalk) 

00:04:45
 Yeah, well, so she's come down and ah, at least talk to me several times about you and of course, I've talked to you. (crosstalk) 

00:04:45
MARK  Well, I wonder when she gonna talk to me. 

00:04:50
 And I've talked to you several times about different things, you know, but the general idea of what's ha. 

00:04:55
MARK It was sort of like our mental war was beginning, right? (crosstalk) 

00:05:00
 Hmm. 

00:05:00
MARK Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:05:00
 What do you think your principal wanted from you at that point, Mark? 

00:05:05
MARK What he actually wanted from me? (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:05:05
MARK And I think, he wanted me to admit that he was right and I was wrong. 

00:05:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:05:10
 She can't talk to you anymore, Mark. 

00:05:10
MARK  She can. I don't remember her talking... (crosstalk) 

00:05:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:05:15
MARK ...to me once. 

00:05:15
 Yeah. How many, you know, she, she teaches 150 kids or so a day, ah, how many times did she have to talk and beg and plead and reasons and so forth. (crosstalk) 

00:05:25
MARK I was begging and pleading and. 

00:05:25
MARK  Hmm. And he says begging and pleading and reasoning. I was thinking he was trying to ah, so like over do it, making me feel rotten and I've never done anything nice to her, she's done all these beautiful things for me. 

00:05:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:05:40
MARK What I felt at that moment, was she's never done nothing good for me that I can remember. 

00:05:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:05:45
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Well, what did you find interesting? Were you surprised that the boy was a sensitive and aware of the dynamics between himself and the principal as he was? Hopefully, the principal was able to use his insights to improve his effectiveness with other students.

INTERVIEW (Man and Woman) 

00:07:25
MARY  I was really angry and frustrated this afternoon. When you're outside sitting in the sun and... (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
RICK Hmm. 

00:07:40
MARY ...here, I was in the house sewing, (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
RICK Hmm. 

00:07:45
MARY trying to cope with the house, the children ah, everything seemed to be going up wrong... (crosstalk) 

00:07:50
RICK Hmm. 

00:07:50
MARY ...and you seem to be just taking it really easy and for some reason, that really ju, just don't get me and I don't understand what was going on with you why, it se, it seems like especially the last week that everything gets left to me. And I mean, I know, I know we have agreements but I don't feel like anybody is living up to them and you're the one I wanna talk to first about it before I talk to the kids. 

00:08:20
RICK  Ah, yeah, I think you're right that I haven't been living up to so many agreements that we've made. Uhm. 

00:08:35
MARY I don't understand why. 

00:08:35
RICK Well, it seems like they're falling apart you know, with the kids and you and me. And we haven't done anything to, redefine them, so for me, I'm on a vacation. 

00:08:50
MARY But it isn't vacation time. It's you know, it's living time, it's, 

00:08:55
[sil.] 

00:08:55
MARY  I don't know we're the same family that we were two weeks ago or three weeks ago and it, it feels to me like, like we're not. Ah, wo, the children aren't doing their work and you're not, I don't know. I just, today I just got so angry, I was, I was trying to sew and it's, it's important to me just to be able to sew and not do anything else when I was sewing and I thought you knew that. And it just doesn't seem to be, it seemed like you know, ah, it just seems like I was the only one doing anything. (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
RICK Sounds like there was something that you wanted from me that I didn't give you. (crosstalk) 

00:09:45
MARY Yeah. I wanted you to do something. 

00:09:45
RICK Okay. That's what you told me this morning too, but you never were more specific than that. And I kept asking you, tell me what it is you'd like me to do and at that time when I asked that you came outside, you said I'm not gonna discuss this and slammed the door went back in the house. And that gives me the message that ah, you really don't wanna talk about things and to stay away from you. 

00:10:15
MARY  It just seemed very useless to me at that point, I, I feel that I brought it up you know, last week, I, you know, again, ah, the week before, you, I was, I went to school in this term and, and you're finished with school right now and waiting for fall for graduate school to start and the agreement was, that you were, you know, you were going to be house husband, (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
RICK Hmm. 

00:10:40
MARY  pre, be primarily responsible for the house, for the children, uhm, you know, as far as meeting their, their physical needs and it doesn't feel like that. It feels like it's all coming back on me again that I'm the one who has to clean the house uhm, talk to the kids about their friends uhm, make lunches when Bryan comes home, all those kind of things and I don't wanna have to do everything. 

00:11:10
RICK  Yeah. When you are going to school, we did make that agreement that I was gonna take care of the house and the kids uhm, but when you decided to stop attending classes, for me, things changed. For me, that meant that you gave up your status of being a student and that I was giving up my status of being house husband and it was time to change things again. 

00:11:45
MARY But it isn't fair for you to change them without some kind of an agreement between us or some kind of discussion just to, just to fade into the background. 

00:11:55
RICK Like you're telling, I'm the only one who changed roles and I don't believe that. You know, (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
MARY You are. 

00:12:00
RICK I think you made a change in roles without discussing that with me too. And I'm getting really tired of hearing, you just say, "It's me, it's me, it's me." You know, where is your responsibility on this? 

00:12:20
[sil.] 

00:12:20
MARY  I don't know. (laughs) 

00:12:30
RICK  What does that mean? (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
MARY I wasn't, you're right, I changed roles. But. 

00:12:40
RICK It seems like what you would've liked me to do is to keep doing the things that we agreed that I would do and give you the flexibility to change roles and go slip into another role if that felt more comfortable. 

00:12:55
MARY Why not (laughs)... (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
RICK Okay. 

00:12:55
MARY ...and you're right. (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
RICK You didn't ask me for that. (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
MARY I guess I was feeling that you, you had some kind of freedom yourself to move into a role of, of doing what you wanted to do and that I deserved that too, and I'm not sure why it wasn't discussed, but I see it's having an effect on our relationship and it's, and it's having effect on the children because they are not holding up there. (crosstalk) 

00:13:20
RICK  Uh hmm. 

00:13:25
MARY You know, they are in to the agreements they're, they're bargains either. 

00:13:25
RICK  What do you wanna do about it? 

00:13:30
MARY  I want more free time. (laughs) I don't. (crosstalk) 

00:13:35
RICK Okay. That's reasonable to me. You wanting more free time, you know, I see what you're making a lotta effort to make new clothes for yourself and I think that's neat. Uhm, I'd like to see you have that time. 

00:13:50
MARY  I, it feels like you're being really solicitous now and it's hard for me to, it's hard for me to imagine that all I would've had is, come in to you and discuss this and then, everything would be okay. I mean, I don't, maybe I expect some kind of argument from you, some kind of disagreement, some kind of ah, and I don't feel that uhm, and it, I don't unders, I don't understand why it's so. 

00:14:30
RICK Why I'm willing to give in so easy? 

00:14:35
MARY Yeah. 

00:14:35
RICK Okay. I think when you first left school, I think there, there was my anger. And I think that's why probably you didn't discuss it with me, was you know that I would've probably given you a lot of flack and in a lot of ways, I did. Uhm, I've accepted the fact you know, that this term was shot for you. You know, that you're not gonna get the credits that you started out to take and there's nothing that I can do about that in any way. You know, while you were in school, I can refuse to see you uhm, and eat lunch with you, say you've got a class or do something like that. 

00:15:10
MARY  There've been a lot of co, conflicts going on with me. It was to whether I wanna continue school, we, you know, what my... (crosstalk) 

00:15:20
RICK Uh hmm. 

00:15:20
MARY ...direction is. Uhm, I know that they surface sometimes, sometimes very indirectly. But I still don't know what I wanna do and you're right. I have hidden that from you. It's very scary from you to talk about 'coz I don't wanna admit to myself that I ha, that I've don't know where I am, that I don't know what I'm doing, what I want, where I'm going. Uhm, in, and I'm beginning to realize now that it's, it's very easy for me to slip back into the role of a housewife, (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
RICK Uh hmm. 

00:16:05
MARY uhm, the role of mother and take those over. Take them over from you, take them over from the children because then it gives me some kind of, it gives me some kind of responsibility, gives me some kind of, it's like I haven't given up on everything. But part of the reason, I guess I don't know. I think. (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
RICK When you take that role, that's a comfortable role for you, to be a mother, uhm, to take care of the house, but you resent that role because that's not very much in it for you. 

00:16:50
MARY It is a comfortable role for awhile. But you know, I've been doing it now for a week or two weeks and it's kind of like when I decide, it'll buoy you know, to be dang-ho about being a mother and in staying home and taking care of the children, the house, you ah, it fe, it does, it feels good for awhile, but then afterwards, I say it to myself what, wa, "am I gonna do this forever", you know, where is the rest of my life... (crosstalk) 

00:17:20
RICK Uh hmm. 

00:17:20
MARY ...going. And then, I start to get angry with myself and I get angry with you. I was just wondering today if I was angry with you because you weren't stopping me. You were just letting me go. Maybe I wanted something from you, some. 

00:17:40
[sil.] 

00:17:40
MARY  I'm not sure what it is. 

00:17:45
RICK  My guess of what you wanted me to do and because you weren't expressing yourself clearly was, if I would've went upstairs and silently clean the house and the living room, and the kitchen and put everything in order for you so that you could just concentrate on the things that you were doing. And I, (crosstalk) 

00:18:10
MARY I feel about, it's what I. (crosstalk) 

00:18:10
RICK that's what you would've like and I guess there was an element of spite there 'coz I knew that you would've like that. And I felt that you did too, but you weren't gonna tell me that. 

00:18:20
MARY That's true. I didn't tell you that. (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
RICK Yeah. So I wasn't gonna do it. Think I hate that role as much you do. I've been in it lots, lot, you know, lot short of period of time, but I hate being a house husband. You know, house work is boring, I find it mindless, uhm, with the nice weather there just a dozen more things that I wanna do with my life than to clean dishes and pots and pans and sweep the floor. And it's just so easy for me to let you slip into that at this time. You know, when I wanna take motorcycle trips and do all kinds of things and that is selfish. 

00:18:55
Woman's Recall Session 

00:18:55
MARY  I was really angry and frustrated this afternoon. When you're outside sitting in the sun and... (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
RICK Hmm. 

00:19:20
MARY ...here, I was in the house sewing, (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
RICK Hmm. 

00:19:20
MARY trying to cope with the house, the children, ah, everything seemed to be going wrong and you seemed to be just taking it really easy and for some reason, that really ju, just dug at me and. 

00:19:35
MARY  At this point, I was, a, I knew, I knew as I was speaking to Rick that I was feeling much more anger towards him than what I was showing and it just wasn't coming out. 

00:19:55
  Do you think he was aware of your anger? 

00:20:00
MARY  I don't think so. Uhm, probably, because my voice was so, what seemed to me controlled. I, I would really doubt that he was aware of that. I, I think I was afraid that if I, that he would get angry at me if I let the full force out of what I was feeling right then. And that, unless I stayed at least somewhat calm that we wouldn't get the, I wouldn't get out what I wanted to say, we wouldn't get it discussed and the conversation would go off on to other things that weren't pertinent to that particular, you know, to what we were discussing then. 

00:20:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:20:50
MARY  And I mean, I know, I know we have agreements, but I don't feel like anybody's living up to them and you're the one I wanna talk to first about it before I talk to the kids. 

00:21:05
MARY  Right there, I knew that I was, I was trying to justify my position. Ah, and I was trying let it come out kind of easy. My position being, "Look, here I, you know, here I am, the good guy and here, all of you are taking advantage of me." 

00:21:30
 Uh hmm. How did you want Rick to see you at that point? 

00:21:35
MARY I think the good guy. Uhm, sometimes, I have a lot invested in being right. Ah, and having things go my way. 

00:21:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:21:55
MARY And maybe sometimes, manipulative in order to make me look better. 

00:22:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:22:05
RICK Haven't done anything to redefine them so for me, I'm on a vacation. 

00:22:10
MARY  But it isn't. 

00:22:15
MARY Maybe really angry when he said he was on vacation because sometimes, I don't feel like, like there is such a thing as a vacation for me. I mean, even when actual vacation time comes, that I still have certain roles I have to uhm, perform certain things I have to do and what I wanted to say right then is, was what gives you the right to be on vacation now. 

00:22:50
 Was there anything that kept you from saying that? 

00:22:55
[sil.] 

00:22:55
MARY  I think it, somehow, I was expecting more of a reaction from him and I didn't feel justifying in saying it uhm, because he was being so soft in his voice and in his manner. Uhm, Rick usually is, is soft in his voice and in his manner. But somehow, a lot of times I expect him to be, uhm, louder, angrier. 

00:23:35
 Uh hmm. Were there any fantasies that were going through your head at this time? 

00:23:45
[sil.] 

00:23:45
MARY  I'm not exactly sure if was that, that spot. But I know throughout the film, there were times when I felt like somebody in the, in the 19 ah, 20's movies where everybody is rushing around, real fast in trying, yo, you know, I, I speeded up of film and sometimes I feel such like there's so many things that I have to do and I feel such tension inside of myself that I really, I really feel that I'm going around, running around that fast and it may not be true but it's sure how it feels that way. 

00:24:30
 Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:24:35
MARY I think a lot of that ties into some expectations I have of what I'm supposed to be. 

00:24:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:24:40
MARY Almost like I'm supposed to be into everything. Uhm, be a good wife, be a good mother, be a housekeeper, be a student, uhm, I take the dog to the vet and realistically, those things aren't always possible. But there's the conflict then because I think they should be possible, that I should be able to do all those things... (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:10
MARY ...even if sometimes I push people away. I push Rick in, and Kyle(ph), and Bryan and Rob away when they wanna help. (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
MARY Somehow, I think some guilt from me because I can't, I think I should be doing all those things but yet I can't. (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:25
MARY  And I don't want them somehow by them offering to help, is like them saying you can't do it, you're not capable. 

00:25:35
 Uh hmm. Let's go back to the tape. 

00:25:40
MARY Okay. 

00:25:40
[sil.] 

00:25:40
RICK  But you never were more specific on that. And I kept asking you, tell me what it is you'd like me to do and at that time when I asked that you came outside, you said, "I'm not gonna discuss this" and slammed the door and went back in the house. 

00:26:00
MARY  I knew he was right when he was saying that, that I had slammed the door and I went back in the house. And at that time, I was thinking why did I do that, you know, what was it. What was it in me that, that cut off that conversation then? Uhm, because I knew at that time that he did want to, did wanna understand, he did wanna talk about it and, and that he really cared what it was he wanted me tell him, what it was that I wanted from him, what it, the specifically the things I've, I wanted him to do. And I, just thinking now, I think maybe the reason I run in the house then was because I didn't have any specifics. And I was thinking, trying to think also when I, when I was seeing it on the tape, what specifically did I want from him, what specifically and I, I don't know, I, it ju, it's just like I told him on the tape. I want him to do something. But I wasn't sure what and having to label that right at that time is what made me go back into the house. 

00:27:20
MARY  Feels like it's all coming back on me again that I'm the one who has to clean the house, uhm, talk to the kids about their friends, uhm, make lunches when Bryan comes home, all those kinds of things and I don't wanna have to do everything. 

00:27:40
MARY When I said I don't wanna have to do everything, there was a feeling that I wanted to take back everything that I had just said because I, I realized that in actuality, I was exaggerating what it was that I had to do rather than what it was that I was taking on myself. But yet I couldn't quite take that back and I think he, it had to do with the anger that I was holding in or that I had been holding in those feelings... 

00:28:20
 Hmm. 

00:28:20
MARY ...for awhile. 

00:28:20
 How did you want Rick to see you? 

00:28:25
MARY  As a reasonable. 

00:28:35
[sil.] 

00:28:35
  What do you think he was feeling? 

00:28:40
MARY At that point, I think he probably recognized that, that I was exaggerating. Exaggerating in, in order to get my point across. Uhm, sometimes, when I feel I'm not gonna be hurt uhm, I tend to blow things ah, somewhat out of proportion. But as I said before, that also comes from frustration from inside of me, from holding it in. 

00:29:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:15
[sil.] 

00:29:15
RICK  The house and the kids uhm, but when you decided to stop attending classes, for me, things changed. 

00:29:30
MARY It kills me when he said that he wanted to stop attending cla, that I stopped attending classes. That's a very difficult thing for me to admit to myself that I blew this term and I'm, it's still not clear why. There were some classes that I finished but not the ones, you know, not all of them that I started and it's a very sensitive point for me and ah, one that I haven't discussed very thoroughly with him that I tried to touch on it one day but it's still too, it's still too difficult for me to talk about it. Uhm, so when he brought that up, I just felt like running and hiding in a corner. Uhm, almost like the bad girl who, who was supposed to do something and didn't do anything or did the opposite of what she was supposed to do. 

00:30:20
  Do you think he was aware of the effect that he had just have on you? 

00:30:30
[sil.] 

00:30:30
MARY  I don't know. Possibly. But if, if he was, I wasn't able to pick it up in his face. 

00:30:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:30:40
RICK  Like you're telling I'm the only one who changed roles and I don't believe that. You know, you are, (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
MARY I think. (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
RICK you made a change in roles without discussing that with me, too. And I'm getting really tired of hearing you just say, "It's me, it's me, it's me." 

00:31:00
[sil.] 

00:31:00
MARY  There I was, I was feeling but not saying that, that Rick was making a lot of sense, that I had changed roles and he had changed roles too and why hadn't, then, why hadn't we discuss that and I was trying to think to myself trying to come up with some reason, some justification of why, why we hadn't discussed that and I couldn't, I didn't know but I'll, I knew that he was making a lot of sense. That, that, that's wa, that's what we could've done to avoid this whole discussion when we've, when we both start coming in. 

00:31:50
MARY There are bargains either. 

00:31:55
RICK What do you wanna do about it? 

00:31:55
MARY  I want more free time. (laughs) I don't. (crosstalk) 

00:32:00
RICK  Okay. That's reasonable. 

00:32:05
MARY Part of, why I was angry in the first place it, it hit me at that point was that I did want more free time. And that's why I was so angry at him today because here, he was taking free time and whether you, whether logically, it was supposed to have been free time or not, didn't make any difference 'coz that I wanted free time that I didn't feel guilty about taking. 

00:32:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:32:30
MARY And. 

00:32:35
[sil.] 

00:32:35
  How are you feeling at that particular point? 

00:32:40
[sil.] 

00:32:40
MARY  I think I felt somewhat relieved that, that I was able to say but I want more free time. Uhm, like whatever burden I felt I had was lifted somewhat because I had connected in my, my head what all this bitching was about. 

00:33:10
 Uh hmm. Do you think he was aware of that feeling in you? 

00:33:15
MARY  I think he was by, by my smiling. Uhm, when I started smiling and I know of a serious conversation. You better know that I had on something uhm, that made sense to me...(crosstalk) 

00:33:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:33:30
MARY ...that was going on between us. 

00:33:35
RICK I'd like to see you have that time. 

00:33:40
MARY I, it feels like you're being really solicitous now and. 

00:33:40
MARY  While I was saying that, I became aware of feelings I have about my own father. Ah, like anytime I, it's, it, anytime I would want to say something to him, whether I disagreed with him. I would get in, in an argument back, you know, get hard at that. And I realized when I was saying that that I wasn't feeling comfortable because, because Rick was being so agreeable. 

00:34:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:34:20
MARY And the comfortableness was coming from an old place. 

00:34:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:34:25
MARY He wasn't, or the uncomfortableness was coming from an old place. 

00:34:30
[sil.] 

00:34:30
  Uh hmm. 

00:34:35
MARY And uhm, at the same time as I was feeling that, I was feeling too, that he was being solicitous as I said. And I wasn't, I guess I was trying to put, you know, it's putting myself in his position and saying if somebody was laying all this stuff on me, would I be so agreeable with you, would I, not wanted to put part of myself on that to say, "Well, hey, a minute now," you know. And although he had done that some, I felt, I still was evidently feeling that the burden of, of making an agreement was on me. 

00:35:30
  Do you think he wanted you to see him in a certain way? 

00:35:35
MARY  Sometimes I get that feeling from Rick that, that he wants me to see him as loving and caring and understanding and warm. And sometimes that's in situations where I couldn't possibly be anyone of those things much less all of them. And then, I get the feeling that there's something else going on back there. You know, how could he possibly feel that understanding when in a sense, he was being attacked, when the very real sense he was being attacked. I mean, you know, I'm right there with my hands at his throat. (laughs) 

00:36:20
MARY A lot of conflicts going on with me, I used to whether I wanna continue school we, you know what my... (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
RICK Uh hmm. 

00:36:30
MARY ...direction is. Uhm, I know that they surface sometimes, sometimes very indirectly but I still don't know what I wanna do. And you're right, I have hidden that from you. It's very scary from me to talk about 'coz I don't want to admit to myself that I, that I don't know where I am. That I don't know what I'm doing, what I want, where I'm going. 

00:37:00
MARY  I was feeling relaxed and comfortable then because things were starting to come out of me that I really wanted to say. Ah, it, it wasn't the things back in the beginning of, really of, of this, you know, the sewing, having time sewing and him being outside. 

00:37:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:37:25
MARY With that I was beginning to realize that that wasn't really the issue. The issue was still some of the, the con, it's like a continue of conflict that I feel about what I want for ah, for my, for my own self. Uhm, it's very frustrating not to know that and I know that, that feeling invades, you know, my relationship with Rick and with the children. And to be able to talk to him about that I knew he was gonna help me. 

00:38:10
RICK  My guess of what you wanted me to do and because you weren't expressing yourself clearly was, if I would've went upstairs and silently clean the house and the living room and the kitchen and put everything in order for you so that you could just concentrate on the things that you were doing. And I. (crosstalk) 

00:38:35
MARY You feel that. 

00:38:35
MARY  I'm not sure now if I was smiling outwardly when he said that. But I know I was smiling inside because sometimes that's exactly what I would like to be, to be taken care of, to have everything done for me. And, uhm, sometimes it's a hard thing to say, But it feels good when it happens. 

00:39:05
RICK  But I hate being a house husband. You know, ah, housework is boring, I find it mindless, uhm, with a nice weather, there are just a dozen more things that I want to do with my life than to clean dishes and pots and pans and sweep the floor. 

00:39:25
MARY When he was saying that, I really knew that it was true that he really hates doing those kind of things and passionately hates it. And I was feeling guilty, too, because I was forgetting that, that I was forgetting how much he dislikes them, how easy it is for him to run from it. Uhm, at the same time being angry with myself because as much as I hate it, I can't run away from it that easily. And it's very, uhm, routine part of myself that I don't like to see. More I'm, I don't know how to explain it exactly but it's easier for me to accept that role. And so I let myself do it even when I hate it, too. And sometimes I wish I could be more, more like he is that way. Uh hmm. But then I get angry be, it, (laughs) I get angry when he does run away from it because he does leave it on me. 

00:40:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:40:35
MARY  I felt reviewing the tape that the interaction between Rick and I was comfortable. I, I don't know to explain it anymore than that except that I, I feel that that it was the beginning of, of probably much more longer conversation, definitely much longer and more involved. But I'd, I'd like the way that, that the both us came off of the original, uhm, hustle. I guess the original point of the conversation on into other thi, other things that were going on with me... 

00:41:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:41:20
MARY ...that were more of, ah, was affecting the relationship and I felt good about that 'coz sometimes it isn't always easier for us to, to move from the, the original topic to what's really going on. I'm not always aware of what's really going on with me and it takes me time to get used to that. 

00:41:45
 Uh hmm. Do you have a handle on how he might have perceived the interaction? 

00:41:50
MARY I would guess his reactions are pretty similar to mine. Sometimes, we have some very heated, disorganized, uhm, distractful, distractful, uhm, arguments, disagreements, talks what, however you wanna put it. And that I'm sure when Rick sees this again, if he'll have some of the same kind of feelings that I do, hey this was pretty good one. You know, this was one where we, we got down to what was going on with us without too much defensiveness, too much hitting below the belt kind of things. 

00:42:30
 Uh hmm. If there are any parts that you would have to do over again, would you change in the, ah, the interaction? 

00:42:35
MARY  No, we won't go back and change it. 

00:42:40
 How are you feeling now? 

00:42:45
MARY Happy, relaxed. 

00:42:45
HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Before listening to Rick's recall of the same tape, let's look at some interesting aspects of Mary's recall. For example, Mary is ambivalence about the housework. She wants help yet pushes people away who offered to help because there was a part of her that says she ought to be able to do it all by herself. And when she said, "My father would have gotten angry. Why is Rick being so agreeable? I'm sitting there with my hands on his throat somehow hoping Rick would help yet not being able to ask." As you listen to Rick's recall, you will find it fascinating how often they knew each other's thoughts and feelings, knew just how they were affecting each other, yet at the same time how many areas were unclear and not well-understood. 

00:43:40
Man's Recall Session 

00:43:40
MARY I was really angry and frustrated this afternoon when you were outside sitting in the sun... (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
RICK Hmm. 

00:44:00
MARY ...and you know I was in the house sewing... (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
RICK Uh hmm. 

00:44:00
MARY  trying to cope with the house, the children, ah, everything seemed to be going wrong and you seemed to be just taking it really easy and for some reason that I really ju, just dug at me. And I don't understand what was going on with you, why it's, it seems like especially the last week that everything gets left to me. And I mean, I know, I know we have agreements but I don't feel like anybody is living up to them and you're the one I wanna talk to first about it before I talk to the kids. 

00:44:45
[sil.] 

00:44:45
RICK  I was fairly confused at that point, uhm, I think I was getting two messages from Mary, one of them was seem to be blaming me for things and the other, wanting to discuss. And I was torn whether to keep listening or just get really angry. Ah, so I was just feeling tense at that time. 

00:45:20
 Uh hmm. How do you think she was feeling? 

00:45:25
RICK  Ah, I think she was feeling pretty tense also and I think it's scary for her to say to me very upfront, ah, I'm angry with you and be very forward with the complaint. Uhm, that's difficult sometimes for Mary to do. 

00:45:50
 What do you think she was expecting of you right there? 

00:45:50
RICK  The last what was confusing for me I was, I knew she wanted me to listen but it sounded like also she wanted me to accept blame, you know, you're responsible for this. And what do you gonna do about it now? And I wasn't so sure that I believed all of that. 

00:46:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:46:25
[sil.] 

00:46:25
RICK  Okay(ph). Uhm. 

00:46:30
MARY I don't understand why. 

00:46:35
RICK Well, it seems like they're falling apart, you know, with the kids and you and me. Then we haven't, done anything to redefine them so for me, I'm on a vacation. 

00:46:50
MARY But it isn't vacation. 

00:46:50
RICK  There was some spite there when I said vacation, uhm, realizing, and I've been trying to hurt Mary at that point. Uhm, knowing she was going through some anxiety about what was happening, you know, I was gonna say well, this is vacation for me. 

00:47:15
 Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
RICK I wasn't even so sure of it when I said that, that that's what I wanted to do and I wish I could've taken it back. Uhm, when I said vacation, I'll just, why did I say that. And I get to her maybe I'm trying to hurt her. 

00:47:30
 Did you feel like sharing that with her? 

00:47:30
RICK Ah, tsk, yeah. Something stopped me, uhm. 

00:47:40
 Get a handle on it? 

00:47:45
RICK I'm not so sure how trusting I was on Mary at that point and how much I wanted to make her feel okay. There's still part of me that wanted to attack back. 

00:47:55
  Uh hmm. 

00:48:00
RICK And I guess that was my subtle way at that point rather than being very direct. 

00:48:05
 How do you think she was affected by your statement? 

00:48:05
RICK  I think it hit the mark that made her angry. Uhm. 

00:48:15
[sil.] 

00:48:15
RICK  Then she was put off by. 

00:48:20
 Is there anything that you wanted to do that, then? 

00:48:25
RICK  I think I would have like to say, "Let's forget that, let's, let there be some caring not this non-trusting attitude." I was disappointed on myself that I didn't do that. 

00:48:40
MARY  It just seems like I was the only one doing anything. (crosstalk) 

00:48:50
RICK Okay(ph). 

00:48:50
RICK  Mary was asking me for something real. You know, "I was the only one doing anything." What she wanted was from me to do something. Uhm. 

00:49:05
[sil.] 

00:49:05
RICK Tsk, Again, I, I'm, because (inaudible ) for us I wasn't sure how much I wanted to give to her. I would, I would've like her to be more direct and say, "I wanted you to do this." And she wasn't doing that, I mean that was really frustrating for me. 

00:49:25
  How do you think she was feeling at that time? 

00:49:30
RICK  I think she was feeling pretty confused. But I also feel that she had always expectations that she knew of what she wanted from me but she wasn't sharing them, yet telling me I should know them and putting me in this, in an impossible situation. 

00:49:50
MARY  And the agreement was that you were, you know, you were going to be house husband, huh, pri, be primarily responsible for the house, for the children. Uhm, you know as far as meeting their, their physical needs and it doesn't feel like that, it feels like it's all coming back on me again, that I'm the one who has to clean. 

00:50:15
RICK I was really angry its, Mary seemed to be dumping a lot of things on me like I'm not doing my share. Uhm, we had an agreement I was gonna be at school, you're gonna be house husband. She was just ignoring the fact that she had failed on her agreements and that that was the reason that I had just copped out on mine. And I really needed her to recognize that, still feeling she's blaming, it's only you. That you're the bad guy. And that put some distrusting distance between myself and her and I don't know what she's capable of doing or how she might hurt me... 

00:51:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:51:05
RICK ...and I really stand back. 

00:51:10
[sil.] 

00:51:10
  What do you think she wanted from you at that time? 

00:51:20
[sil.] 

00:51:20
RICK  And she wanted me to do some taking care of kids, the house and her. But she wasn't asking me for that. 

00:51:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:51:35
RICK  And that's why I didn't wanna do it, I needed to be asked. 

00:51:40
RICK  When you decided to stop attending classes, for me things changed, for me that meant that you gave up your status of being a student. And, that I was giving up my status of being house husband and it was time to change things again. 

00:52:00
RICK  I seemed very calm there but I remember I just wanted to scream all of that, you know, ah, "you gave up being a student, you did this." And I just was feeling pressured to say it in a way that Mary would hear it. And feeling just to have to stayed tight and control a lot of the anger and frustration that I was feeling though. 

00:52:30
  Were there any other risks involved? 

00:52:35
RICK  Yeah, there were two, one was not being heard, and the other is that I would have looked like a, a bad guy and I think that I wanted to look okay. 

00:52:55
 How do you think you will look into her? 

00:53:00
RICK I think I was still looking like a bad guy but not to the extreme where if I would have been yelling and screaming since, you, you see I'm right. And you're terrible sometime. 

00:53:15
 Do you have any feelings about where you wanted the interaction to go from this point? 

00:53:25
RICK  I wanted Mary to take some responsibility for what happened and to really define what her needs were. I think I was ready to hear them, if she would only been willing to tell me what they were. 

00:53:40
[sil.] 

00:53:40
RICK  And I'm getting really tired of hearing you just say, "It's me, it's me, it's me." You know, where is your responsibility in this? 

00:54:00
[sil.] 

00:54:00
RICK  I think when I saw Mary pause and particularly smile, I was feeling good at that point realizing that we finally had touched to each other, that there were some understanding. Uhm, tsk, it just felt good that I was being heard and my concerns will be acknowledged and I felt that open the way that that was the real turning point that we're gonna start really talking to each other instead of at one another. 

00:54:40
  Do you think she was aware of your feelings? 

00:54:45
RICK Yeah, I do. She smiled and I smiled back and there was that trust starting to come back and that really felt good to me. 

00:54:55
 Where did you wanna take it then? 

00:54:55
RICK  I just wanted to hold her, you know, like that would have been neat, uhm. 

00:55:05
  Is there anything that kept you from doing that? 

00:55:10
RICK  I think the, the physical setting of being at separate chairs or if we might have been talking on the sofa, I probably would have done that just getting off would've felt awkward to me. 

00:55:25
[sil.] 

00:55:25
MARY  But I see it's having an effect on our relationship and it's, and it's having effect on the children because they are not holding up they're, (crosstalk) 

00:55:40
RICK Uh hmm. 

00:55:40
MARY you know, they're into the agreements they're, they are bargains either. 

00:55:45
RICK What do you wanna do about it? 

00:55:45
MARY  I want more free time. (laughs) I had to, I would. (crosstalk) 

00:55:55
RICK Okay. 

00:55:55
RICK Some are really, the real issues were coming out there, uhm, and I was feeling good Mary was starting to define that, "I want more free time, I would've like to us sleep into somewhere else, different than being a student. It was need to hear that come out because that was really never discussed before and that seem like that was really behind all of this. I was feeling much closer to Mary at that time 'coz I knew where she was coming from. And that always brings me closer on it and I feel lots better about her and myself and what's happening between us. 

00:56:35
 Uh hmm. Any body's sensation is associated with that feeling? 

00:56:35
RICK  I think there's something warm, I feel something warm inside but I don't know if I could describe that to you. 

00:56:45
  How do you think she was feeling? 

00:56:50
RICK I think she was feeling that too, the, the tension went down between us like there was not a potential now for the real fight. We will gonna listen to each other and we both knowing that, that was safe to, to let go of some scary thoughts. 

00:57:05
RICK Uhm, I'd like to see you have that time. 

00:57:10
MARY  I, it feels like you're being really solicitous now and it's hard for me to, it's hard for me to imagine that all I've, would've had if come to, to you and discuss this and then everything would be okay. 

00:57:30
RICK  I got pushed back because I was feeling that there was distrust between us and now I wasn't being believed. 

00:57:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:57:45
RICK And I got really angry with that. Uhm, something prevented me from expressing that, though. 

00:57:50
  Can you get a handle on it alone? 

00:57:55
RICK Tsk, I think that had to do with, I was aware of wanting to be very nice or listen very carefully. And yet maybe sometimes at home I don't do that. And Mary was picking up on that that I was trying extra hard. I would've like her say, "Gee, that feels good." But instead she said, "You're being solicitous." And that pissed me off. I, tsk, you know, I didn't wanna help anymore after that. It was, it would have been, it was difficult for me to wanna do anything. 

00:58:40
 Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:58:40
RICK I think I also became defensive. 

00:58:40
  Uh hmm. How do you think she was feeling? 

00:58:45
RICK  In some ways, defensive saying why is this so easy now. Uhm, I had so many fears about this and how much wanting me to yell and get angry to meet those expectations. I was like, wow, he's really gonna be angry with me when I say this. 

00:59:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:59:10
RICK  I made it difficult for me to want it get back into trusting. 

00:59:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:59:20
RICK And I remember physically withdrawing, ah, I might have been closer and I just sat back I wanted as much distance as I can get from Mary at that time. 

00:59:30
 Do you think she was aware of the effect that you was having aware. (crosstalk) 

00:59:35
RICK Yes. I'm very aware. I think she might have been frightened that I was listening so carefully and why was that somehow wanting more of an anger reaction for me, I think that's, was her way of asking, get angry with me.

MARY  Uhm, I know that they surface sometimes, sometimes very indirectly. But I still don't know what I wanna do. And you're right, I have hidden that from you. It's very scary from me to talk about 'coz I don't wanna admit to myself that I, that I don't know where I am, that I don't know what I'm doing, what I've.

RICK  There were some relief there it's, Mary have to pull in back but that's solicitous remark that was made, I was feeling that we're in touch with each other again. Uhm, that was hearing so many things that I've never heard before that Mary was afraid to discuss with me and I was getting the message that she was trusting me now but that's okay. You know, what I'd like to give her some reassurance like that's neat, you're doing that. I don't know what stopped me.

HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Did you notice in the Recall Sessions how one consistently assume that the other did not accurately pick up of thoughts and feelings? There were instances of incredible sensitivity and also instances of the inability to act on those understandings. Rick needed to hear from Mary what she wanted even though he feels certain that he knew what that was. Why? Wasn't that fascinating when Mary explained on recall that she is pushing Rick to get angry because that's what her father would have done. Rick, however, refuses to follow the script she is writing because he knows that if he does, she'll say, "Uh-huh, see there, I knew it all along." Presumably then, he would be cast as a bad guy and rejected. By the way, who was the jury in each person's mind? Who will judge us as the good guy or the bad guy? Have you experience this? When you interact with someone is there an audience in your mind that you are trying to win over? How do you think this affects what we do and say?
