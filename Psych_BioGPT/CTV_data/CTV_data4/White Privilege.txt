00:00:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hi, I’m Lewis Schlosser, I’m the professor of counseling psychology at Seton Hall university and with me today is Dr. Julie Ancis, she is the professor of counseling psychology at Georgia State University. One of Dr. Ancis' interest is white privilege and multicultural counseling in general. She’s here today to talk to us about white privilege. Dr. Ancis thank you so much for agreeing to have this conversation with me. 

00:00:50
JULIE ANCIS You’re welcome, thanks for having me here. 

00:00:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER First place to start would be just to… just a general talk about like what is white privilege? Ah… So start with that. 

00:01:05
JULIE ANCIS I guess, I would define it as others have defined it ah… that it’s essentially unearned opportunities ah… or advantages as a function of a characteristic or quality that is often times by accidents like your… your skin color or your gender, those kinds of things, but there are you know, opportunities and advantages that are not necessarily the results of your efforts. 

00:01:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And so in this case with having white skin and the benefits that you get because of it and so maybe you could… for the audience give us some… like some concrete ways you would like to manifest some day to day life's of people could be able to identify it when they see it… 

00:01:45
JULIE ANCIS Hmm…hmm. 

00:01:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER What kind is it look in… in day to day life when white privilege is in operation. 

00:01:50
JULIE ANCIS Hmm…hmm, well, it could manifest in very seemingly sort of insignificant ways to some seemingly in more significant ways, but um… one way in which it often manifest is you know the opportunity to for example go into a bank and get a bank loan without having race be considered as a negative factor or renting an apartment or buying a house or even trying to develop a professional relationship with somebody where often times if you are not of a privileged race that particular racial group that you are part of could be seen as a disadvantage or a negative. So it manifest in sort of day to day operations everyday for many people. 

00:02:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Okay. 

00:02:45
JULIE ANCIS Or most people or all people I’d say. 

00:02:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And maybe if you could talk a bit about hmm… like for you from where you first became interested in like understanding whiteness and white privilege? 

00:02:55
JULIE ANCIS I think it came through my experiences with gender actually as a women umm… having certain ah… experiences growing up as a young girl and then later in graduate school and subsequence of that and not really realizing that those experiences which were not always positive were associated with my gender and it wasn’t until graduate school that I had some more significant experiences around this and I started speaking about it with people who at the time I think were more advanced than I was, in terms of their thought process around this and then started getting very heavily interested in reading some major feminist thinkers and writers that were not necessarily in psychology or in our fields, folks like Angela Davis and Bell Hooks, that spoke about the intersections of gender, race, ethnicity, umm… sexual orientation and that’s really sort of opening up my mind to you know for other… other isms and I think that was very significant. Ah… but also I have to say hmm… like life experiences growing up in Manhattan from very early age having very diverse friendships ah… with folks from all over the world ah… that may have been sort of an introduction or though more positive one than the negative ones that were associated with gender and then lets you a greater awareness and awakening with regard to how privilege manifest ah… along the line of multiple identities. 

00:04:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So you had some positive experiences with being open as to other experiences because you had a wide rate of friendships living in a place perhaps one of the most diverse cities in United States. But then there were some also negative experiences mostly around being a woman… 

00:04:55
JULIE ANCIS Hmm…hmm. 

00:05:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …To the degree that you want to talk about even like one as an example… 

00:05:00
JULIA ANCIS Hmm…hmm. 

00:05:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …You might be able to… feel comfortable sharing with us… 

00:05:05
JULIA ANCIS Hmm…hmm. 

00:05:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …That might be particularly representative… 

00:05:10
JULIA ANCIS Hmm…hmm. 

00:05:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …Of an experience that kind of helped you think about yourself in… in terms of identities. 

00:05:15
JULIE ANCIS Sure, I think, the most profound negative experiences, ah… related to I think what most women experiences harassment, sexual harassment in day-to-day. So, if you live in a… in urban city that’s something that you almost become accustomed to um… comments, sexualized comments or experiences then as you go to school and/or get into the work place umm… those become more profound in terms of their potential impact for you professionally. So, I’d say that involved a more blind harassment experience when I was older um… that had a potential impact on me ah… professionally and I was very embarrassed and shamed by it. I felt shame by it, although it was not something that I was responsible for and like I said ah… previously, it’s like a discussions with others actually a male friend at that time who was more aware about sort of identifying this as sexual harassment and which he cleared it was um… and so before I wasn’t even ready to articulate that or understand it. So, those were the, that’s you know the negative aspects that I was speaking of. 

00:06:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And then your friend sort of gave you voice or the words to describe what it was… 

00:06:50
JULIA ANCIS Hmm…hmm. 

00:06:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …And more the non self-blaming way it sounds like. 

00:06:55
JULIE ANCIS Yes, absolutely. Hmm…hmm and a… um… a faculty member as well who was very interested in these issues and was a real advocate and she gave me ah… voice or the words to articulate this and that led to a great awakening for me. 

00:07:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So is your understanding yourself as a woman was, it sounds like the pathway to understanding yourself as a white person, primarily or this that was still the introduction. 

00:07:30
JULIE ANCIS That was one. 

00:07:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER One? 

00:07:30
JULIE ANCIS Yeah. 

00:07:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Where there are others? 

00:07:30
JULIE ANCIS Huh…huh. So, ah… to be more intimate um… interactions and relationships with folks that were non-whites um… that had… I had great affections for and being with these people and seeing that my experiences differed as a result of being with these folks um… which I could only attribute at the time to their you know race um… that was another sort of… or another eye opening um… experience and actually, you know some of my work um… shows that to be true, that is for white people it’s often their experiences um… with somebody else that they are close with, a person of color that sort of leads to in awakening about issues of race and privilege. 

00:08:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Are there, and you’ve talked about some of these examples already around… around the such harassment, where other key moments sort of… sort of hard moments if there were any like about specifically about white… about your own white privilege that you could sort of look back on and talk about it. 

00:08:45
[sil.] 

00:08:50
JULIE ANCIS Yeah, I mean, its, it’s, it’s a difficult thing to really talk about as you watch your own development from maybe a place where you look sort of relatively lacking in consciousness and buying into the stereo types that you grew up with to come into sort of a greater awareness and understanding. So, you know again um… these were sort of experiences with people that I got close with that maybe you go to a restaurant and you know, you were seated ah… kind of in the back of, of the restaurant… 

00:09:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Because of who you are with. 

00:09:35
JULIE ANCIS You know, for example, because of who you are with. So, um… you know they don’t know to say, know what your… your degrees are or sort of anything else about you. So, you could only attribute it to the fact that it’s race and so, for me that was very hard to deal with I think for the person of color who is… um… have… has experiences on a regular basis, they don’t necessarily see it sort of a shocking to the system. It’s something that they have had to content with or deal with regularly for white person who has not and he was just coming into that kind of experience. Um… you know they need to often work with that or digest it or process it in a different way. 

00:10:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So it was really your, sounds like it was your experiences with people of color that helped you sort of become aware of, the privileges you hand by may be things that you… things that happened to you by being with them like being seated at the back of restaurant when you might normally have not. 

00:10:35
JULIE ANCIS Hmm…hmm. Yeah, or you look at your own ah… you know kind of racist ideology and then you look back on it and you look at experiences were sort of every member and undergrad going to a very diverse undergraduate university, but um… you know if one had potentially a roommate that was of a different race or ethnicity that, that was such a horrible thing you know and I remember at the time not even questioning that is something that would be aversive, you know looking at it now I think its like, I can’t even imagine sort of like, you know a different identify that I had or different way of viewing the worlds, so… 

00:11:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Okay, with such case a little bit, maybe you could tell us if you believe that there are what are the common misconceptions people might have about white privilege? 

00:11:35
JULIE ANCIS Maybe one misperception um… is that one does not have to work very hard or doesn’t have to be demonstrate a lot effort if they’re white that automatically things come to you umm… as a result and that’s you know not necessarily true that anyone who really wants to achieve whatever that maybe, whatever their goal is, needs to work very hard, ah… and needs to exert a great deal of effort and persistence in the face of obstacle. So it’s not like, ones whiteness is going to buy ones sort of ticket wholesale into the, into the world. So, I think that’s one misperception. 

00:12:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER But of course in the flip side might actually be true than I read that like when I’m a white person and I fail, I don’t think I’m ever, I don’t think they are going to say, oh, we’ll see all those white people… 

00:12:30
JULIE ANCIS Sure. 

00:12:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …They can, they can do it… 

00:12:30
JULIE ANCIS Right. 

00:12:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …In the same way person of color might contend with… with that dynamic. 

00:12:35
JULIE ANCIS Absolutely, absolutely so it’s certainly an advantage, but it doesn’t mean that you know… it just stops there and then no effort or initiative that's required or intelligence for that matter. 

00:12:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Kind of are there any others that you can think of? 

00:12:50
JULIE ANCIS Any other… 

00:12:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Misconceptions about white privilege. 

00:12:55
JULIE ANCIS Yeah, that’s potentially somebody who doesn’t have, who lacks in understanding or awareness with regards to issues of race and privilege is morally or ethically corrupt in someway, you know that they're they are evil you know and it’s often times you know somebody wasn’t really thought about these things, you know who is not conscious about it, hasn’t had dialogues or conversations or had a particular up bringing. Ah… so it doesn't necessarily mean that, that lack of awareness pervades their ideas about life or that they are not a good person or a morally adjust person or evil. 

00:13:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Evil? 

00:13:40
JULIE ANCIS Evil. 

00:13:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Okay. Can you talk little about… you know with some aspects of identity and you and I have had a lot of conversations in, in our lives about Jewishness ah… like… like sex orientation being kind of hidden identity… 

00:13:55
JULIA ANCIS Hmm…hmm. 

00:14:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …But maybe if you talk a bit about as a converse how at least what people assumptive of make about you based on their skin color which maybe wrong, but you know as we think about white privilege have the impact of it being visible sort of impacts the dynamic of white privilege as you compare to may be other aspects of privilege like the… cater sexual privilege as an example. 

00:14:20
JULIE ANCIS How the dynamics of white… 

00:14:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Of whiteness, of whiteness being visible, like someone looking at you and I and saying like well these people have white privilege ah… because of the color of their skin… 

00:14:30
JULIA ANCIS Hmm…hmm. 

00:14:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER But maybe not knowing other aspects of identities which might be socially oppressed? 

00:14:35
JULIE ANCIS Okay, yeah. Well, for… for many Jewish people and I'm Jewish, for many Jewish people being white in often times not so salient. You know you’re whites you know or perceived as whites although not all the Jews are white and ah… that’s the common misperception to… 

00:14:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. 

00:14:55
JULIE ANCIS …That all Jews are white, but um… that’s the…the whiteness is not so salient for often times to Jewish person, the Jewish identity is and that’s because of the history of prosecution and oppression that use your face for thousands of years and almost every, every country they’ve lived in that, um… that that becomes such an important aspect of your identity when you think of an aspects of your identity that doesn’t represent advantage. 

00:15:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hmm…hmm. 

00:15:30
JULIA ANCIS And so, often times Jews can’t, don’t necessarily relate to this whiteness thing or this you know white privilege although many are, um… many have advantages of the function of their whiteness psychologically um… that’s not always the place that they're coming from and so, there is a defensiveness I think that often happens for some Jewish people um… when somebody points out their advantage as a function of their race because they don’t necessarily feel you know advantaged as a Jewish person in the world. 

00:16:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right, so that is the way in which it’s both like what’s sailing to me, so the salience of persons identities, but also then that it’s not, but they also may not feel privileged even if they have benefited from it, because in their mind they are viewing themselves in certain way, even if the outside world views them differently. 

00:16:25
JULIE ANCIS Right, absolutely right. 

00:16:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER But their internal view is… is different story. 

00:16:25
JULIE ANCIS Hmm…hmm, absolutely. 

00:16:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Okay. Hmm… what do you feel… what I guess would you think would be some ways in which sort of shifting gears they get to know more about action strategy if you were like, so what can educators do and folks do who are learning about white privilege to help people? Who are white people? Sort of at least get in touch with the fact that they have privilege and sort of knowledge of privilege and be empathy to the experience of people of color again so again focusing on what else can color privilege? 

00:16:55
JULIE ANCIS Hmm… I have some experience with this, because I’ve been teaching for many years, um… the multicultural classes righting about it by… by teaching on the masters and doctor level. and I have found that when I have students exploit their own identities, their own racial and ethnic identities that empowers them in many respects and makes it easier for them to understand the identities of others, the oppressed identities and they advantage identities, for many white people um… I feel or I see that they feel a loss of their, you know ethnic heritage. They are not really connected with their Italian or Scottish or English or French heritage, that’s completely missing that they don’t I'd say have an understanding that many of the values that they hold, many of the over behavioral expressions or verbal expressions or philosophies or function of their ethnic heritage um… and… and there is a weird distortion that sometimes happens as well where I’ve heard students say well at least this person of color has an identity, you know umm… 

00:18:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Oh, like, you know, you know if you give a white person like their cultural color warms(ph) activity I'd say. 

00:18:20
JULIA ANCIS Hmm…hmm. 

00:18:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Tell me about your cultural groups, you know like fresh accomplishment or foods representative of agricultural group and they a person who is white and detached from their ethnic origins doesn’t know what to put down right? 

00:18:30
JULIE ANCIS Right, right, right and so there is a big loss there I think as many immigrants came to the United States and where um… really pushed to assimilate into this melting part and lost a sense of their own sort of heritage and identify and that’s disempowering, it’s disempowering for white people. So I find that when I have white students really explore their own backgrounds and freeze them up and empowers them not in a superficial kind of you know empowered way, but a place, a substance that they are then more likely to explore other identities that are not their own. 

00:19:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So by acknowledging that they have these cultural identities of helping them sort of getting touch with that, that helps them then have empathy for other people. 

00:19:20
JULIE ANCIS Yeah, I'll have them write papers about it, you know have them go and… and… do had their own history, do their own research with regard to their particular ethnic and racial backgrounds and write about that. We have these discussions in class. Often times I feel that if I start the multicultural classes talking about you know racism and prejudice um… ones defenses start um… arising very quickly and it’s very hard to then talk about these kinds of things. Another thing… 

00:20:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Go ahead. 

00:20:00
JULIE ANCIS I'm sorry. Another thing as I acknowledge that, you know I’ve have to struggle with my own belief system, my own believes about race and ethnicity and privilege and that this is not an easy task that it often takes a long time and a lot of effort and a lot of work and that I still struggle. 

00:20:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Did you say you share that struggle with them is that, that I must see you? 

00:20:25
JULIE ANCIS Yeah, that there is an aspects of that's, that even though I’m writing about these things, I’m very committed to multiculturalism in my personal and professional life that I still struggle with these kinds of messages that we’ve all been subject to. 

00:20:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Is a sort of roll model that we've got, we don’t have to all figure it out either. 

00:20:50
JULIE ANCIS Absolutely. 

00:20:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER We’re just sort of on the path and… 

00:20:50
JULIE ANCIS Yes. 

00:20:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …Maybe a little bit further long, further long down the path. 

00:20:55
JULIE ANCIS Yes. 

00:20:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And now you are helping them in the way that the faculty member helped you… 

00:21:00
JULIE ANCIS Hmm…hmm. 

00:21:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …Like sort of understand something in a different way. 

00:21:00
JULIE ANCIS Hmm…hmm. Yeah. 

00:21:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Okay, yeah my question was going to be where there are other strategies used and it sounds like that’s another one that you sort of some self-disclosure or even about where you are in the process. 

00:21:10
JULIE ANCIS Absolutely… and specific stories as well you know personal stores I find that is helpful and… and also starting the class and saying I really want this to be a class that sort of, we have open discussion and honest discussion and dialog um… that’s respectful and that those conversations just stay in this, this personal conversation stay in this room, because I think there is also lot of creative apprehension um… from many people not just students about being seen as, you know racist or having certain prejudices and if we stay at that level, then the conversation really goes nowhere and the thoughts can’t be challenged… 

00:21:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Because people become afraid to speak? 

00:21:50
JULIE ANCIS Hmm…hmm. 

00:21:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER What are… um… as we… as we could actually moving into wrapping up, um… as you think about like people who are watching the video and what you want them to sort of walk away with? Like you know what are some take home messages for folks who are learning about white privilege, things that you think would be important for them to just sort keep in their mind? 

00:22:10
JULIE ANCIS Hmm…hmm, that were all subjected to all um… kinds of internalized isms and it’s a part of I think being in this world and being a human being, um… you know whether it’s biologically driven or environmentally driven or combination um… that’s just the facts of life and that's this is really a process that is dismantling these kinds of beliefs that are destructive um… for oneself and for others because if one holds these belief systems it’s very hard to connect with others interpersonally and one is closed off and rigid and walking around, scared with all kinds of distortion someone's had so that this is a life long struggle and life long process and it’s also I mean, I trained counselors and I changed psychologists that is really imperative that one… one challenges these ideas to be a better um… psychologist, to be a better mental health professional and to be a better person. 

00:23:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And that its a journey that’s really sort of never ends. 

00:23:25
JULIE ANCIS Hmm…hmm. 

00:23:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER You are not gonna give someone a little ribbon at the end schools and say you're not racist, doesn’t really have to talk about white privilege anymore ever again. 

00:23:35
JULIE ANCIS Right, right. 

00:23:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Is there anything that you had hoped, I would ask you that you wanted to talk about when you thought about we’re going do the same video that I didn’t get to any one of, share anything with us about. 

00:23:45
JULIE ANCIS I think you've covered this is you know, you are a good interviewer. 

00:23:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Oh! Thank you very much. I mean, I really appreciate you are sharing your time and your expertise with us today. It’s been very informative. 

00:24:00
JULIE ANCIS Thank you, thank you for doing that as its important.
