JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Good afternoon. Thank you for joining me or welcome back if you are umm… on our first seminar this morning. And we're here today to talk about Yoga and Mindfulness Based Tools to support children with ADHD. Now a lot of us work with kids with ADHD, and many umm… of us probably work with kids who may or may not have ADHD umm… whether they have been diagnosed or not is up in the air. Now as we dive into this topic, it's important to remember that the symptoms of ADHD, like distractibility, impulsive behavior, the need for movement, these symptoms are common to all children. They are a natural part of childhood. But for some these symptoms become overwhelming and significantly impact their capacity to succeed in both academic and personal settings and we need to offer them tools and support. What we talk about today is primarily driven by umm… the experience of children with ADHD. But you'll see that many of the practices are also relevant for kids who are just struggling umm… with some of these symptoms, but may not actually be diagnosed with ADHD. So you could use them in both ways. All right. So in order to understand how yoga and mindfulness can help support children with ADHD, it's important to understand a bit more about how our children's brains and bodies are functioning in relation to their nervous system. So we're gonna experiment with this a little bit in our own bodies to gain a better sense of their relationship. Guys, up for a quick experiment? So put everything you've got down umm, if you've got a drink or a pan or computer, just put everything down. Find a way to sit comfortably. And this is just umm… Sit comfortably is not code for sit in some special way. It just means find a way to sit so that your body feels comfortable and isn't too much of a, of a distraction. But the kids I often talk about umm… try not to lean too far forward or back or side to side just find the middle, right, sit comfortably. And now for 30 seconds, I'm going to ask you to breathe in and out only through your mouth. Okay, so this is an experiment so breathe in and out only through your mouth. If it feels okay for you to close your eyes, close your eyes. If it is not gonna work for you to close your eyes, I recommend either looking down, right, or looking out in front of you staring at one thing that's not moving. So start whenever you're ready. Breathe in and out only through your mouth and your task while you're doing this is just to notice what if anything you feel, and what is your experience, what arises for you. And I would particularly encourage you to notice any physical sensations that you may feel in your body as you're breathing through your mouth. You'll hear the sound of the singing bowl when 30 seconds has gone by. Go ahead and start now. 

00:03:20
[sil.] 

00:04:00
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Open your eyes or look up. Now whatever just happened for you, whatever came up over those 30 seconds of breathing through your mouth, tuck it away, don't forget it. And for the next 30 seconds, breathe in and out only through your nose, just through your nose. And you're task is just to notice what if anything feels different. What changed from breathing through your mouth to breathing through your nose? Go ahead and start and I'll ring the singing bowl in 30 seconds. 

00:04:35
[sil.] 

00:05:25
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Okay. So what happened 30 seconds of breathing through the mouth versus 30 seconds of breathing through your nose? What I'm gonna ask is that you take the next minute, just one minute to jot down a few notes. What was your own experience like? When you moved from breathing through your mouth to breathing through your nose, what changed? Right. What did it feel like to breathe through your mouth? What sensations arose in your body? What changed when you started breathing through your nose? So I'm gonna give you one minute to take some notes about your own experience. Go ahead and start now. 

00:06:00
[sil.] 

00:06:50
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Take about five more seconds to finish up whatever it is that you're writing. 

00:06:55
[sil.] 

00:07:05
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Okay. So let's talk about what happened. For most people, the vast majority of people, not everyone, but most people, they experience that breathing through the mouth is an uncomfortable one. The mouth gets dry umm…. many people experience a feeling of an increased heart rate uh… muscle tension, muscle engagement is something that people frequently talk about, experiencing when they do this experiment, umm… increased sensitivity to noise. Sometimes noises in the environment start sounding very irritating, very kind of grating, umm… and oftentimes when I do this experiment with people and ask, "Okay, how did you feel?" Umm…. One of the responses, the common responses with both children and adults is that they felt a sense of anxiety, of discomfort that they wanted it to stop, that they were thinking this is like longer than 30 seconds here, okay. So let's talk about umm… Now what happened with the switch, right? For most people the experience of breathing through the mouth is an uncomfortable one, anxiety producing, a little anxiety in the body as well as in the emotions. And for most people when they start breathing through their nose they feel better. And most people talk about how when they start breathing through the nose it feels natural, their tension goes away, the anxiety goes away, their body can relax a bit, and it just feels normal. So we're gonna explore, we're gonna talk about for a few minutes why this is the case and why it's so relevant for our children with ADHD. So what you just experienced in that experiment was the power of the relationship between your breath and your nervous system. When you started breathing through your mouth, you sent, uh… a look alive something's up message to your brain. You're sending your brain the message that there's a problem, there's a threat, and your body reacted accordingly by activating what's called your sympathetic nervous system, sometimes also called your fight-or-flight response. Now everyone participating here experienced this a little bit differently, right? Everybody's personal embodied experience of the, the practice was a little bit different based on a combination of your own sort of physical, by your own personal biology, your own life history and also your own personal skill set for managing anxiety and threat. So there are differences in how people experience this. But overall most people experience breathing through the mouth as an increase in engagement in that sympathetic nervous system activation uh… a sort of welcoming in of that fight-or-flight response. Now something important to, to recognize is that when you're sympathetic nervous system engages, it primarily does three things. One, it gets your body ready for action, so that increased heart rate, that muscle engagement, that's getting your body ready for action. It also heightens your senses. So we may gain a couple of degrees of peripheral vision, sounds become more acute, even that feeling of like hair standing up on your arms that you get when you're threatened umm… that's to increase your sensitivity to touch, to be able to feel things like a change in the way the wind is blowing. And so your body gets ready for action and your senses are heightened, and your sympathetic nervous system engaging also amps up umm… what I call with the kids, the protective brain. This is really umm… the limbic area of your brain, the part of your brain that is responsible for responding to threats, the part of your brain where your instincts live, where you umm… act based in reaction umm… where your instinct driven rather than thoughtful, I call that the protective brain with my kids. So the sympathetic nervous system engagement, it makes the body ready for action, all right, it makes the body want to move. It makes the mind very distractible. The mind is scanning for threats, senses are heightened and behavior gets very impulsive and very reactive. So think about these three things in relation to ADHD, right? We have kids whose bodies are wanting to move, who are highly distracted by sensory input and whose behavior is impulsive and reactive, right? Sympathetic Nervous System activation and ADHD often look very similar. Now when you began breathing through your nose, right, when you changed how you were breathing, you also sent an equally powerful message to your mind. You sent the message "Everything's okay. There's no emergency here, sympathetic nervous system stand down." And think about it. If there was a real emergency, say a bear jumped out of the woods and started chasing you, would you breathe through your mouth or your nose? Definitely through your mouth. If there was a true emergency, you would be breathing through your mouth to bring in as much oxygen as possible, right, to give yourself as much air as possible. When you breathe through your nose, you're telling your brain, "there's no real threat, there's no real emergency." Sympathetic nervous system, take a break. Thank you very much, call you when needed. Right? The parasympathetic nervous system is often called our rest and digest mode. It governs our digestion, our healing, our growth umm… things that affect both our short and long-term wellbeing. Whereas the sympathetic nervous system is really concerned with and responsible for our immediate safety, right, protecting us from immediate threats. The parasympathetic nervous system umm… helps bring the entire system into balance, right? So that the long term needs of the organism, us, can be met as well as the short term needs. When the parasympathetic nervous system is in-charge, we have full access to our prefrontal cortex. What I call with the kids the thoughtful brain. And we have full access to that prefrontal cortex. We're capable of seeing the big picture, taking the long term view, considering other people's feelings, umm… regulating our behavior, all right? So there's one more important piece of the mind, body, nervous system relationship that we really need to talk about and examine before we begin diving into the practices. So we're not just ruled by our nervous system, we're gonna talk a little bit about what's happening in our children's brains as well. Now this is where I have to give you my disclaimer, which is that this is a massive simplification. It has to be because we're gonna spend like less than five minutes talking about something that people spend their whole life studying and then still barely know anything about, okay. This is a simplification, but it's a useful simplification. And I'm offering it to you because it can help us better understand the experience of our kids with ADHD and it can also give us a language to talk with kids about what's happening in their own brains. So I hope you'll accept my disclaimer. All right. So this image, the picture that you're seeing on your, on your screen is an image of a healthy adult brain. Now I say that because the various parts of the brain are all equally lit up. They are all ready for action. They are differentiated, right, each cut, each part of the brain is a different color, they are differentiated, but they are all connected and engaged, right? Now if this was a picture of a child's brain, it would look quite a lot different. Now when our children are born, the prefrontal cortex which is that red part of the brain is more like a dull grey. I imagine it as more like a dull gray. It's there but the connections haven't been made, and it's not ready to work in the world, it's not activated. What is strong in our kids is the limbic system. This is the part of the brain that is responsible for our basic body functions, our big emotions. It's the part of our brain that's always trying to keep us safe. This is also the part of the brain that's responsible for kind of pressing the on button of that sympathetic nervous system response. I call this the protective brain. This is the part of the brain that is looking out for the person's immediate safety and self interest. This is the strongest part of the brain in our kids when they are born. Now this part of the brain is not taking the long term view, it's not considering other peoples feelings, it's not trying to like gain a wider perspective on things. This part of the brain is asking the question, "Am I safe? Am I safe? Right now, am I safe?" And this part of the brain always things, it knows exactly what to do if the answer is no, right? This part of the brain doesn't second guess itself. If the answer to that "Am I safe" question is "No" this part of the brain just roars in thinking it knows exactly the solution for every "No, I'm not safe" problem. Okay. Anytime we act based on a strong emotion or an impulse without giving too much thought to either the logic of our action or its consequences, we're likely acting on the direction of our protective brain. And, and again this protective brain, this is the part of the brain that's responsible for pushing that on-switch of the sympathetic nervous system, our fight-or-flight response. Now when our kids are born, this brain is the most… This part of the brain is the most dominant part, and that dominance lasts for about 25 years. That is a long time. It takes the average person living a fairly safe life about 25 years, for what I call the thoughtful brain, which is of course the prefrontal cortex, umm… to catch up to get as strong as ready to work in the world as the protective brain. Now consider for just a moment that literally everything we're asking of our kids in terms of reducing their ADHD symptoms, right, regulating their emotions, overriding their impulses, managing distraction, literally everything that we're asking of them is organized by the thoughtful brain. Yet, the protective brain is the strongest and most dominant part of the brain for every child. So we have to recognize that what we're asking of our kids is really hard. And the reality is what we're asking of all of our kids is hard and for kids with ADHD, it's even more challenging. Now when we're talking about reducing ADHD symptoms, what we're really talking about is getting a child to use their thoughtful brain instead of their protective brain. We're trying to keep that thoughtful brain engaged in whatever the situation at hand is. For a child to sustain focus on a particular task, control their impulses, make a rational decision. We have to get the child to use the thoughtful brain. Right, this part of the brain that sees the big picture considers the long term view and makes rational decisions. In thoughtful brain mode, our kids are capable of handling challenges without feeling threatened and evil to reduce sympathetic nervous system activation. Now as we're trying to increase our kids' capacity to focus, what's happening is the thoughtful brain tries to focus on something, the thoughtful brain is trying to help that kids stay connected to what they are focusing on, and the whole time the protective brain is over here trying to distract them, constantly demanding attention. Anytime some little thing in the environment changes or their protective brained detects, detects some sort of stimuli that could in any realm be construed as a threat. The protective brain is over here trying to distract the thoughtful brain and the protective brain is really very strong. Okay. So how does this process of getting our kids from having this super strong protective brain in this kind of dull gray thoughtful brain? How does this process of transforming the thoughtful brain into a vibrant, bright connected, ready to work part of the person work? And to understand umm… how to get kids to develop their thoughtful brain, we have to understand how this development happens. For me, I'm a really visual person. So it helps for me to think about this in kind of a visual way. So imagine, for example, that you are a baby and imagine you're a baby, right, with a really strong protective brain in a really dull, kind of, not at all ready for action thoughtful brain and now you're born into the world. It's your first day. As soon as you're born, stuff starts happening to you. All right, people are talking to you, you hear sounds, you feel sensations, you receive nourishment or not, right. You're feeling things like umm… "I'm too cold" or "I'm hungry." You're feeling these sorts of sensations for the first time, and the protective brain is like all over it, right. As soon as your born stuff starts happening. Your body gathers up all this information through the senses, and then it sends them up to your brain, right, through the spinal column up to the brain. Now I imagine the protective brain sort of like this big hogging figure hanging out right at the top of the spinal column, ready to grab up that information and act on it, right. Now remember the protective brain is always asking the question "Am I safe?" So that information starts coming in, right, coming in, and the protective brain is just right there ready to grab it, saying, "Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe?" Okay. Now if that protective brain is getting the message over and over that, yes, you're safe, yes, you're safe, right. Information is coming in, the protective brain is checking it out saying, "Oh, yeah! I'm still safe." After a while, maybe like a year, maybe a little bit more, after about a while the protective brain starts to think "Maybe I am okay. Maybe I'm doing pretty good, maybe we're safe here, and I don't have to do everything myself." And when that happens, information starts coming in and the protective brain goes, "Yeah, I think this is pretty safe" I'm gonna pass this information along to the thoughtful brain. Now remember the thoughtful brain is just kind of hanging out there dull gray with no experience, having no idea what to do. I always imagine this sort of passive information, this protective brain passing info to the thoughtful brain almost like a little spark, like a little zzz, zzz, wake up, look alive, time to do something. And the thoughtful brain takes the information and goes, "Oh, God, I guess I got to do something" and acts in the world. Now we're talking like a level of "Oh, this sandwich had crust on it." The thoughtful brain getting to decide, "do I throw the sandwich across the room or just not eat it?" Maybe it decides just not to eat the sandwich, right? This is, this is the kind of the level we're talking about with this introductory kind of protective brain passing the information stuff. Now once the thoughtful brain acts in the world, the protective brains hanging out waiting to see what happens, right? The protective brain is waiting to see what happens. And if the person is still safe, right, if the thoughtful brain acted and now the person is still safe, the protective brain learns, "Oh, maybe I don't have to do everything myself." And the thoughtful brain learns, "Oh, I guess I can do some stuff." And then that process happens over and over and over again thousands of times, that the protective brain feels safe enough to send info to the thoughtful brain. And every time the thoughtful brain receives information and acts, it develops connections, it gets a little stronger, a little brighter. And eventually after about 25 years of this happening over and over and over again, the thoughtful brain is as strong as the protective brain. Now this doesn't mean the protective brain has faded away. It means that there's like a fair fight. It means that the thoughtful brain is as strong as the protective brain. And that now the thoughtful brain can have a little oversight, and if the protective brain starts freaking out "Oh, my gosh, this information is so scary." The thoughtful brain can be like "Come on, pass it along. We've seen this before. I can handle this. Give it, give it up, give up the goods" Like the thoughtful brain can reach out and, and regulate the protective brain, a little soothe, the protective brain comfort the protective brain and take information. But until the thoughtful brain is as strong as the protective brain, the protective brain gets to decide what information goes to the thoughtful brain. Which means if the protective brain is freaked out for whatever reason, no information is getting through to the thoughtful brain. All right. So that's how the process works if all things are going reasonably well in a child's life, not like rainbows and unicorns, just basically okay. This child feels basically safe in the world if the protective brain is getting the message, "I'm basically safe in the world" then this is how the process goes. And the thoughtful brain after about 25 years gets as strong as the protective brain. But what happens when the protective brain is being provoked, right? When the protective brain doesn't quite feel safe in the world? Then the protective brain starts hoarding information, not passing it to the thoughtful brain, keeping the thoughtful brain from getting practice and making the protective brain into what I call an overprotective brain. Now an overprotective brain has a hard time recognizing what is a threat and what isn't a threat. When the protective brain becomes an overprotective brain, it's really a big problem. In overprotective brain has a really hard time telling what's safe and what isn't. So it responds to seemingly harmless interactions, sometimes even friendly interactions as if they were threats and it's constantly monitoring for problems. Now the other protective brain and the thoughtful brain are both important parts of every child. We're not trying to get rid of the protective brain, but when a pfrotective brain becomes an overprotective brain, it makes it really hard for people to exist in relationship with other human beings. And if you're acting as if everything is a threat, it makes it really hard to exist especially in a social environment. Okay. So what does this all have to do with ADHD? Well, children with ADHD are often kids with overprotective, protective brains and edgy sort of quick to engage sympathetic nervous systems. Now this doesn't mean that all kids with ADHD had an unsafe living situation or have experienced trauma or in some other dramatic way have had the protective brain umm… turned into an overprotective brain through a lack of safety. It's important to recognize that many, many things can provoke the protective brain and cause it to become overprotective, including environmental stimuli. Now many types of stimuli that are not at all disturbing to other kids are provoking the protective brain of children with ADHD, right? Things like umm… bright lights or certain types of noise, umm… certain physical sensations. Even for some kids umm… being in rooms with lots of people or umm… kind of having a lot of social interaction without a break, without a reset uh… all of these things can provoke the protective brain, kind of nudge at the protective brain of kids with ADHD in a way that they don't for other kids. So you can think of it as, you know, when a child is born into the world with a certain set of sensitivities, a certain kind umm… disposition to their protective brain ,if they are born into an environment that pokes at that protective brain, that pokes at that specific sensitivity, then they have a likelihood of developing an overprotective brain, even if their parents are lovely and their school is safe and all those other things are okay, right? The protective brain can become an overprotective brain umm… through the faults of no adults, right, just the environment at hand. Now reducing the onslaught of stimulation can be very, very helpful for kids with ADHD, both in the immediate term and in the long term. So if we can reduce the external stimulation, the poking at the protective brain, we can take the edge off that protective brain and increase the likelihood that it sends information to the thoughtful brain. Okay. So I'm gonna pause for just a moment to see if any questions have come in and also to remind you that you can send questions and if you like. Do we have any questions right now? Okay. So we don't have any right now, umm… but please don't hesitate if you'd like to send in a question later on, I'll pause again a little bit later to take them. Okay. Yoga and Mindfulness. Now yoga and mindfulness can help children learn to use their own inner resources, specifically their body, their breath and their mind often through self talk to reduce their ADHD symptoms and improve their overall wellbeing. These are practices that have the effect of activating, engaging the parasympathetic nervous system, soothing the protective brain and engaging and exercising the thoughtful brain. Now the practices that follow are all based on the little flower yoga five elements framework of connect, breathe, move, focus and relax. Umm… This is a structure that's been created to support umm… a holistic comprehensive mind, body, nervous system experience, in a way that's developmentally appropriate, in a way that is easy to implement. The first activity that we're gonna practice together today is a connect activity. Now connect activities are about both connecting with ourselves and the world around us, including other people. I'm gonna ask as we move into the practice session of the seminar, that you really do your best to engage in a personal exploration of the practices. So put all your stuff down, try not to, you know, distract yourself with what's around you, don't use the practices to check your e-mail or your text messages, umm… try to stay connected and feel what these practices feel like in your own body. It's going to be a terrible idea to try to use these practices, with the children in your life, if you don't have a solid understanding of what they feel like in your own body. So as we move into this connect activity, put your things down, and find a way to get comfortable in your chair or on the floor, wherever you're sitting. Now as we do the activity, I'm gonna ask you to just stick with me, do the practice. And then I'll repeat what we did, so that you can write it down or take notes if you'd like after. So we'll have each practice kind of repeated two times that you have the opportunity to both engage and take notes. The first practice we're going to do today is called Layers of Sound. So go ahead and either close your eyes… If it works for you to close your eyes close your eyes. And if it's not gonna work for you to close your eyes, you can either look down or look up at something that's not moving. Don't look at me because I'm gonna move around a little, but look at one spot that's not moving, and let your eyes rest on that spot, a focal point. And now imagine, imagine that you could open be near ears as wide as you can, imagine opening your ears very, very wide. And imagine stretching your sense of hearing as far out into the world as you can and listen for the very furthest away of sounds that you can find. 

00:31:55
[sil.] 

00:32:30
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Now pull your sense of hearing closer. Imagine that your sense of hearing almost like a net that you could pull in, that you could pull closer, and listen for the sounds that are happening just inside the building or home where you're sitting, right. Just listen for the sounds that are happening inside your building. 

00:32:50
[sil.] 

00:33:30
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Now bring your sense of hearing even closer and listen for the sounds that are happening just inside of the room. 

00:33:40
[sil.] 

00:34:20
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Now bring your sense of hearing even closer and listen for the sounds that are happening just inside of your own body. 

00:34:30
[sil.] 

00:35:05
[music] 

00:35:20
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Go ahead and open your eyes and look up. So that's a practice called Layers of Sound. And again what we did is we invited… Well, I invited you and you would be inviting the children in your life to expand their sense of hearing, stretch their sense of hearing as far out into the world as they can and listened for the very furthest away sounds that they could find. Now often times after I do this with the kids I ask them, "What did you hear?" Now when I ask adults, "What did you hear?" They always talk about like, "Oh, I heard the traffic" or "I heard someone talking in the next room" things like that. Umm… The kids often say things like, I heard the sound of the ocean or I heard the lions roaring in Africa. Uh… My all time favorite was I heard the sound of the moon going around the earth. So the kids tend to set, stretch their sense of hearing much further than us, which is great, just absorb it. And so I ask you to listen for the very furthest away sounds you could find. Then come a little closer and listen for the sounds just inside of the building, then just inside of the room and then the sounds inside your own self. Now the side… the sounds inside your own self, this is also an area that can be interesting when you ask the kids, "What did you hear?" They say all the typical things that you would imagine like, "I heard my stomach grumbling. I heard the sound of my heartbeat. I heard my breath." But the kids also tend to notice the thoughts that pop into their head and perceive them as things they heard. So they'll, they'll share things like, "I heard the sound of my mom yelling at my brother this morning" like memories, ideas, thoughts, that pop into their head, they interpret as having heard them and they share them in that way. Okay. So that's the basic practice. Now this is a practice, Layers of Sound. This is a practice that is very powerful at soothing the protective brain, right. This is a practice that gives the protective brain exactly what it wants, which is the opportunity to scan the environment for threats. Often times kids are in situations where they are umm… transitioning between spaces, they are coming into a classroom, they are in the hallway, they are moving, moving, moving. They don't have a lot of self-determination, right? They don't have a lot of choice about where they are gonna end up next. And then often when they end up in this new environment, they don't have the chance to check it out before it's like "Okay, turn to page 47 ta-ta-ta" right. What an activity like this does is give the protective brain the opportunity to systematically find out what's out here. "Oh, okay, out here is safe, now I can come a little closer. Oh, okay, this is safe. Now I know I can come a little closer. This is safe, now I know I can come a little closer." The protective brain doesn't much like to focus on what is right in front of us or especially what's inside because usually most of the time threats are coming from the outside. The protective brain is highly motivated to attend to, to attune to sensory information coming from the outside world. That's why sounds are so distracting. The protective brain is all over it. Right, this is a practice that you can use to support your students with ADHD umm… in a couple of different situations. One is when they are transitioning, right? So in transitions, between spaces, between rooms umm… this is a great practice to do as a kind of reset. "Okay, now we're in this room. Let's suite the protective brain and then move forward. Let's give this brain a chance to orient to the environment." This is also a practice that you could teach kids to do on their own. They don't necessarily need you to guide them. Once they have done it a few times, you can teach them to do it on their own. This is a practice you can offer them so that when they are distracted, right, by sound during say a test or homework or a conversation with a friend even. When they are distracted by sound, oftentimes kids with ADHD and kids without ADHD, often have a hard time moving, right, mentally moving from the source of that distraction back to what they are trying to focus on. They get stuck hanging out with the distraction. This is a practice that says, "Okay, if you're taking a test and a truck backfires outside, your attention is pulled." Acknowledge that your attention is pulled and then do a short layers of sound practice say, "Okay, I'm listening to the sounds out there. Now I'm listening to the sounds in here. Now I'm bringing my hearing a little closer. Okay, now my brain is back here with my body, and now my mind is in the same place as my body." You can teach your kids to do this practice on their own and then they can use it as a step by step pathway or process to bring their attention back to the task at hand, when their mind has been pulled by this… by the distraction of a sound which is, which is one of the most common distracters for our kids. Okay. 

00:40:35
[sil.] 

00:40:40
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER So now we're gonna talk about Breath Work. One of our most powerful inner resources is our breath. The way that we're breathing is continuously sending messages to our brain and our nervous system about what's going on in our environment and changing our breath is a very powerful way to change our physiology. Right? When we inhale through the nose and when we slow down our exhale, we send a message to our brain and our nervous system that we're okay. Right, that there is no danger. Now a slow even steady breath is a great tool for kids with ADHD, but that's not what we're gonna do together today. You can always practice if you have kids with a ADHD. It's always gonna benefit them to practice slowing down their breath, breathing in and out through the nose and really soothing that sympathetic nervous system. But what we're gonna do today is a practice called breath of joy. And this a way that we can coordinate moving our breath… moving our body with our breath. Now kids with ADHD are often really, really wanting to move their bodies. One of the reasons that they are wanting to move their bodies is that often their sympathetic nervous system is being engaged, flooding their body with adrenaline and adrenaline makes us want to move. And adrenaline sometimes makes people umm… edgy and even a little aggressive as well. Now the way that we process adrenaline out of the body is through movement, right? That's how we process adrenaline out of the body. When we've got kids whose bodies are flooded with adrenaline and they are just stuck sitting in a chair, right? They are just hanging out with that adrenaline kind of making them edgy, anxious maybe even aggressive, but no way for that adrenaline to dissipate through the body. So we gonna practice something called Breath of Joy which is a really wonderful tool that you can use when you feel like your kids need to reset. You're not necessarily trying to calm them down. We often think about kids with ADHD is like, we need to calm them, we need to get them calm, but they need energy, they need to be engaged, they need to stay alert so that they can learn and participate in life, right? So we're not always trying to just calm kids down as much as that would make it easier for us. We actually need our kids to have energy. And this is a practice that can help give them an energy that is grounded rather than energy that's frenetic. So we're gonna stand up to do this practice. I'm gonna clear my space a little. I would suggest you do the same. You don't need a yoga mat, you don't need to take off your shoes, but you just need a little space around you to be able to move. 

00:43:20
[sil.] 

00:43:30
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Okay. So start in mountain pose, separate your feet a little bit. Make sure your knees aren't locked. Relax your shoulders. Now Breath of Joy, like I said is a practice where we're combining the movement of our body with the movement of our breath. We're gonna start slow and then we're gonna slowly start to speed up our movement. So what you're gonna do first is take a quick inhale as you raise your arms, you're inhaling. And then you're gonna inhale again as you wing your arms out to the side. So… And then bring them up again. And then fall forward with a loud… So I'm gonna do it again more slowly. It's gonna look like this. 

00:44:20
[sil.] 

00:44:30
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER So if you haven't tried it yet, do it with me. I'm gonna start slow, and then I start going a little faster and a little faster. Now with your kids, you want to always give them the reminder that if something doesn't feel right for any reason, it is up to them to stop, check it out, figure out what's happening, and make a decision that works for their body. Most kids have a really positive experience of Breath of Joy. You might notice, if you start going too, too fast that you might get a little light headed, right? That's not a big problem, if you always remember, if something doesn't feel right, if something's feeling off just stop. But you really have to send that message to your kids in a powerful way because kids are really used to getting in trouble for doing something different than what everyone else is doing. Right? So in order for them to say, "Hey, I can listen to my own body and stop if something doesn't feel right." They have to know that you really, really mean it, that you're not gonna be upset with them for doing something different from what everyone else is doing or doing something different than what you are doing. Now kids with ADHD unfortunately are often kids who are used to getting in trouble a lot. So they need to hear this message even more strongly than your other kids. All right. So let's give this a try all together. I'm gonna start slow and then move a little faster. Remember, inhale, inhale, inhale, sigh it out. Okay. 

00:46:00
[sil.] 

00:46:35
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Now roll back up to stand and take a moment, and come back to mountain pose. Maybe even put a hand on your heart and a hand on your belly and just check in with how you're feeling. 

00:46:50
[sil.] 

00:47:00
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And make your way back to sit. 

00:47:05
[sil.] 

00:47:15
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER So I'm coming to sit in this small chair because the next thing that we're going to do together is a movement practice. And we're gonna do a chair yoga sequence together today. So movement offers us a tremendous opportunity to explore the resources of our body to connect with our own strength, our own capacity. Umm… We're gonna look at two different types of movement practices. Umm… We're gonna do one chair yoga practice and then we're gonna do one mat based practice. Now it's always a great idea to, uh… to practice yoga in a chair with your kids. If you have any sense that maybe they are not so into it, right, they are still out there are even though many, many kids are exposed to yoga and there's a lot of acceptance of yoga generally in the culture, there's still a sort of sense of yoga is for a particular kind of person. And a lot of kids may not identify themselves as a yoga person. Now I found that when you bring the movement practices into a chair, instead of saying, "Okay, take off your shoes and get on a mat, right." When you can bring the yoga practices into a chair, you often take away some of the kind of psychological barriers to participation for some kids and especially teens. So if you get any sense that your kids might be like not feeling like they are yoga person, think about doing some chair movement. Even if you think your kids would have no problem with it and giving them the experience of doing movement in a chair, sends a very strong message that you can do this anywhere, you don't need to take off your shoes, you don't need a yoga mat, you don't need anything, you can do this right in your own classroom. Okay, so bring both feet onto the floor, feet flat on the floor in front of you and sit up tall. Let your shoulders relax and bring both hands onto your knees. Take a breath in and as you breathe in, roll your shoulders back and look up. And then as you breathe out, round your back and look at your belly button. Do that a few more times, inhale and open your body. Exhale and round. Inhale and open. Exhale and round. Inhale and open. Exhale and round. Now inhale and open. But this time bring your arms up and out as you look up. And then as you exhale, give yourself a hug. Inhale and open. And now bring the opposite arm on top. And do that two more times, inhale and open, get very big and then bring the opposite arm on top. Inhale and open. And switch arms. Now inhale, bring your arms up but sit up very tall. Bring your arms straight up and get along and then take a gentle twist to your right. It always feels good I think to bring your arms down on the twist instead of leaving them up. You can bring one arm to your chair and one arm to your right leg. I'm gonna take a full breath here. And then come back to the middle and over to the other side. 

00:50:50
[sil.] 

00:51:00
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And come back to the middle. And then as you bring your arms down, just give them a good shake. Shake them out, shake them out, shake them out. All right, shake your shoulders a little. And now slide all the way forward in your seat. So you're like kind of just hanging on, right, just you're really far forward. Reach your arms out in front of you and slowly start to lean back. Lean back until you feel your core engage. Until you feel like it's a little bit of work to stay here. And we're gonna practice boat pose right here in this chair. So as you lean back and notice what part of your body is working, right? What part of your body is working hard? And then experiment with lifting one knee just a few inches and then switch. Bring up the other knee and switch, switch, switch, and then slowly lift both knees. Notice what part of you is working hard. See if you can relax your face. And then come on down. Bring your feet down and let yourself hang over your chair just for a moment. And then come on back to sit. Now close your eyes or stare at one spot that's not moving, and just take a breath or two, and notice how you're feeling. Did anything change for you before we did this movement to after we did this movement? How's your body doing? How's your mind doing? 

00:52:40
[sil.] 

00:52:50
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Go ahead and open your eyes and we're gonna transition down to the floor. I'm gonna move this chair to the side. And come down on to the mat. Now the chair yoga sequence we just did, I'll talk you through quickly, so you can take some notes if you want them and then we're gonna do a forward fold on the floor. So what we did in the chair is we just put both of our feet flat on the floor, sat up tall, two hands on our laps, and then we started to breathe in and out with just a gentle, what's called a cat couch stretch. So we inhaled as we opened our bodies and looked up, exhale as we rounded our bodies and looked towards our belly buttons, we did that a few times. And then we started to bring our arms into the movement. So then we inhaled and opened our arms, exhaled, gave our body a hug. Did it again, open, bring the opposite arm on top, slow brain balance, full thoughtful brain engagement here. We did that two times on each side. And then we came up to sit, arms high, and did a twist, twist to the other side. Then came back to the center and shook out our arms on the way down. And then finally we did boat pose in the chair. So we slid forward on the chair, kept both feet on the ground to start, arms forward and leaned back until our core muscles engaged. And then once we got far enough back to feel our core working, right, to feel our own strength, then we experimented and did with lifting one knee and then the other, one knee and then the other, playing with that noticing the feeling of it. And then we lifted both feet to practice engaging our balance, and then forward folded over our legs. Came up to sit, paused for a moment to check out what happened, what sensations we felt, what our experience was. So that's it. You know, it just takes a few minutes to really give your kids a good movement break. Okay. Now we're gonna transition. We're gonna do one more movement practice. Umm… we're gonna do a movement practice. You don't need a mat. If you're on the floor, that's fine. What we're gonna do is a seated forward fold. Now for a lot of kids with ADHD, over-stimulation is a big problem. Giving kids a few minutes to uh… get a break from that over-stimulation to kind of curl inward and uh… protect themselves a little bit from the onslaught of information from the world tends to be a really good system reset. Now you can do a seated forward fold with your legs in a variety of positions. Some good options are to sit with the bottom of your feet together or to sit with your legs straight out in front of you. So I'm gonna sit with my legs straight out in front of me. All you need to do is make sure you're sitting up tall, and then, and this is the most important part of forward folding. From my perspective, you want to get along with your body before you come down. So often times we forward fold in daily life through this rounding of our spine. We often do that in a forward fold as well. We just round our spine and kind of hunch down. See what it feels like instead to get along. So the way that I do this with the kids is, I have them put both hands on their heart and then I have them imagine pulling like a thread, like imagining they have a thread attached to their heart. Just pull it straight forward get long, long, long, long, long, long. Reach your arms out as far as you can and then bring your arms down and allow your body to relax. You can close your eyes if that feels good. I'm gonna take a few breaths here. 

00:56:50
[sil.] 

00:57:05
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And then slowly come back up. Okay. I'm gonna pause just for a moment to check in and see if we have any questions. So I'll be quiet for a minute. And if you have any questions feel free to send them in. 

00:57:25
[sil.] 

00:57:50
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER So it doesn't look like anything's coming in. So we're gonna move on to talking about our focus element. Now oftentimes we think, attention deficit disorder and focus is very, very present in our minds. How can we get these kids to focus? The distractibility challenge sometimes looms large as the primary challenge. Umm… I'm gonna do focus activity with you, but what I'd like to suggest umm… is that you consider paying more attention to supporting your kids parasympathetic nervous system activation and soothing the protective brain than you do to like drilling them on focus activities. My experience working with children with ADHD has been that if we can address those first two challenges, the overprotective brain and the edgy sympathetic nervous system, excuse me, some of the focus issues umm… really start to resolve themselves. Right, that sympathetic nervous system over activation makes it very hard to focus. If we can address one, we always are addressing the other. Okay. So what is this practicing focus all about? Now for Little Flower we're very clear with our kids that practicing focus is just that, it's a practice. It's always a practice. Sometimes I go so far as to say "We're never actually focusing, we're always practicing focus." Our kids need to hear that focusing on one thing is hard, not only is it hard sometimes it's impossible. What we're doing when we practice our focus isn't putting our attention on one thing and then keeping it there like a vise grip. We're practicing, noticing when our mind wanders, catching it and then practicing bringing it back. Noticing the wander, catching it, and bringing it back. A wandering mind is perfectly natural. Being distracted by sights, by sounds, even by the thoughts in our own mind, this is natural. This is what the mind does, right? It's not some sort of defect or some sort of umm… thing that's wrong with us that our minds are highly distractible is actually the nature of the mind. Our kids need to hear that, especially our kids with ADHD because they're very likely to think that their inability to focus that their constant distractibility means that they're somehow broken. And then when you come in with activities and you say, "These are focus activities." They automatically think "Oh, I can't do that. That's not for me" right? And I often umm… use the analogy of a dumbbell of lifting a weight, and if you umm… joined us on the webinar this morning, you heard me talk about this already. Think about the idea of lifting a dumbbell. Right? If I put a weight on the floor and I just held onto it really, really, really tight, like as tight as I could for a long time, would my arm get stronger? No. I have to pick it up and put it down, pick it up, put it down, pick it up, put it down. That's what we need to do for our attention muscle as well, right? If we just try to keep our mind fixed in one spot, it's not gonna work, we can't do it. But even if we could, it wouldn't help us strengthen our attention muscle. It would probably just give us a headache, right? We need to catch our mind wander and bring it back, catch it wander, bring it back. We need to do that over and over again. And you can imagine that as like repetitions of an exercise for your attention muscle. I find that when I explain attention to kids with ADHD in that way is very empowering. It gives them the sense that there's something they can do actively do with this distractible mind they have, that the distraction isn't umm… a liability, it's actually an opportunity to strengthen their attention muscle, okay. So one form of focus practice, the simplest form of focus practice is called single pointed focus. Where you put your attention on one object, be it a visual object or sound, umm… a sensation. And you practice literally noticing when your mind wanders and bringing it back. We're gonna do something today that's a little bit more engaged that involves the moving of our body and the incorporation umm… of what's also often called umm… a power saying, sometimes called a mantra, umm… but just something that you say to yourself, that you repeat to yourself over and over again. So what we're gonna do is a practice where we connect our thumb and our first finger, then our thumb and our middle finger, then our thumbs and our ring finger and then our thumbs and our pinky fingers. I'm gonna do this movement over and over again. We're gonna repeat this movement, and then we're gonna put a saying to it. Now some good options for kids with ADHD or any kids really for that matter. One is I am so strong. I am so strong. Our kids need to be reminded of how strong they are. Another good one that I often do with kids is "I am in charge." Now, if you're gonna do this "I am in charge" saying with your kids, they have to be old enough to have a conversation about what that means. So I never do this without uh… uh… conversation. What does this mean? What are you in charge of? Right, there are a lots of things in the world that you are not in charge of, but there are some things that you are always in charge of. What are they? Right, our kids need to be reminded of what is within their control. Which is of course their own reaction to the world around them, like their own decisions, their own choices, their own actions, they are in charge of that and so are we. So let's give this a try. And the idea is that you would do this with your kids and just invite them into the practice. You're gonna do it out loud with them and then remind them to notice if their mind wanders. And if it does, just catch it, say, "Oh, wandering mind" and then bring it, excuse me, bring it right back to the practice. So we're gonna try this. We're gonna today together say "I am so strong." You're gonna hear that I'm gonna start off a little bit softer and then my voice is gonna get louder. And then after it gets loud, it's gonna start getting soft again, and then it's gonna fade away, I'm gonna go quiet. Always tell the kids, when I go quiet, that means you can keep practicing silently in your own mind until you hear the sound of the singing bowl and then you will know it's time to open your eyes or look up. So let's get ready and I strongly encourage you to try this at home, even if you feel little silly. Okay. So hands in your lap, palms facing up. I'm gonna start and you can join in whenever you are ready. I am so strong. I am so strong. I am so strong. I am so strong. I am so strong. I am so strong. I am so strong. I am so strong. I am so strong. I am so strong. I am so strong. I am so strong. I am so strong. I am so strong. I am so strong. I am so strong. 

01:05:50
[sil.] 

01:06:35
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Go ahead and open your eyes or look up. Just notice how you are feeling. 

01:06:45
[sil.] 

01:06:50
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Okay. So this practice is kind of a fan favorite with a lot of kids. This is one of those ones that they really just seem to enjoy, they ask for, they want to do over and over again. Umm… It's also one of the things that we get feedback umm… from parents, from classroom teachers umm… that the kids are doing it on their own. Sometimes right in the classroom they are like, when their, when their bodies need to move a little, but they don't want to get in trouble, they can't distract other people. Umm… We get feedback that the kids are silently doing this with their fingers under their desk, which is a really positive thing. It's an outlet for some of that movement umm… that they can do without distracting anybody else, without bothering anyone else. Okay. So this is also something you can do with your kids uh… once they get used to the practice, once they have learned the practice. You can ask them "What is it that you need to hear?" Right? "What do you need to tell yourself about yourself?" And you can have the kids create their own sayings, their own phrases, and you can work with them to develop really any four word phrase will do umm… to develop a practice of their own that's rooted and what they think they need to hear. Now a warning. If you're doing this with little kids like preschool age kids umm… they can often do it, but a lot of times they need to look at their hands especially at the beginning. Sometimes they're just, they're like, they really need to watch what their fingers are doing. And what I would recommend is, if they're doing that, just spend some time practicing the hand movement by itself, and don't add in the words until they get really comfortable with it. Okay. So we connect, we breathe, we move, we practice focusing and then the last element of our program is relax, at the final element is relax. Giving the body time to rest umm… reducing external stimuli, relieving some physical pressure or just nourishing ourselves is overall balance into our entire system and will help engage the relaxation response for your kids with ADHD, helps soothe that sympathetic nervous system and engage the parasympathetic nervous system. We're gonna do a practice together today called tense and let go. Now my suggestion is that if it's at all possible for you to do so you lay down. Now I'm gonna take a moment just to let you do that, adjust your space in whatever way you need. If you have a yoga mat that great. You can lay down on the floor, on a couch, on a bed, wherever you happen to be. Umm… if it's okay for you to lay down and I would suggest you lay down flat on your back. Now if you can't lay down right now you can stay in your chair it's not a problem, but intentionally choose a position that's gonna be maximally comfortable for you. So we're gonna do something called tense and let go which is a progressive muscle relaxation. I'm gonna talk you through this progressive muscle relaxation. You want to put your body in a position where you can let go of your muscles as much as possible, not have to hold yourself up, so if you're sitting in, in a chair that might mean putting both feet down in front of you and leaning back in the chair. It might also mean just putting your head down on the desk in front of you. If you put your head down on the desk in front of you my suggestion is to push yourself away from the desk and then fold forward so that the just your forehead is resting on the desk so you can breathe without turning your head to one side or the other. So give you a moment now to set up your space and decide whether you want to lay down or get comfortable in your chair. I'm gonna stay seated so that you can hear me. 

01:10:40
[sil.] 

01:11:15
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Settle in wherever you are. If you're laying on your back maybe let your feet kind of fall out to the sides that your legs are relaxed. Bring your arms to your sides. My suggestion would be see what it feels like if your palms are facing up. And if you're sitting in a chair just make any small adjustments you need to make now so that you're doing the least amount of work possible to hold up your own body. 

01:11:50
[sil.] 

01:11:50
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And now bring your attention to your toes and squeeze the muscles of your toes as hard as you can. Make little fists with your feet. Squeeze your toes. And then release them. And now squeeze all the muscles of your whole foot from your toes to your heels. So if you can engage all those little muscles hold them as tight as you can. And then let them relax. And now think about the muscles from your ankle to your knee. Squeeze the muscles of your calf. All the muscles from your ankles to their needs engage them almost like you're hugging your bones. Pull those muscles in tighter, tighter, tighter and relax them. And now engage the muscles around your knee itself. If you're laying on your back you might even be able to feel yourself pull your kneecap up a little. Engage all the muscles around your knees. Squeeze those muscles. And release them. Now engage the muscles from your knees right up to your hips. Squeeze them in tighter. A little bit tighter. Tensing the muscles as hard as you can, and then relaxing them completely. 

01:13:50
[sil.] 

01:13:55
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Now from the tips of your toes right up to your hips see if you can let your legs get even more relaxed. Let all the muscles in your legs go, imagine your legs getting heavier and heavier and heavier. 

01:14:15
[sil.] 

01:14:25
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And now squeeze the muscles around your hips, your belly, even imagine engaging all the little muscles in your back. Squeeze those muscles in, tighter, tighter and then let them go. Now pay attention to the muscles in your chest and your shoulders. Tense those muscles and even bring your shoulders up by your ears. Engage those muscles as hard as you can, squeeze them tighter and tighter. And then release them. Now tense the muscles from your shoulders down to your fingers. So we make fists with your hands. Squeeze those muscles so hard if you're laying down you might notice you can squeeze the muscles of your arms so hard the arms lift off the ground just a little bit. Squeeze those muscles in. A little bit harder. And then release them. And now imagine your arms and your shoulders to your fingertips getting heavier. Let go of all the muscles that are holding up your arms. And let your arms get as heavy as possible. 

01:16:00
[sil.] 

01:16:10
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And now engage the muscles of your face, just squeeze the muscles of your face. Maybe try pressing the tongue to the roof of your mouth can scrunch up your nose in your eyes. Can even engage the muscles in your lips squeeze them, purse them. Just go for it. Nobody's taken a picture of you. Squeeze the muscles of your face as hard as you can. And then relax. And imagine your head getting heavier and heavier. 

01:16:55
[sil.] 

01:17:00
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Now checking with your body and notice if there's any part of your body that wants to tense and release either again or any part that you miss. If there is any part of your body that you want to engage and relax go ahead and do it now. 

01:17:20
[sil.] 

01:17:25
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And then let your whole body feel heavy from your feet to your head and down to your fingertips. Imagine the weight of your body sinking into the floor. 

01:17:40
[sil.] 

01:17:45
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Notice any places where you're trying to hold your own body up and think "Put it down. Let it go." And rest. 

01:17:55
[sil.] 

01:18:00
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And will stay here for about 30 more seconds. I'll be quiet, when you hear the same sound of the singing bowl you'll know that it's time to start waking your body back up. 

01:18:15
[sil.] 

01:19:00
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Take your time. You may want to start with wiggling your fingers and your toes, maybe taking a few deep breaths. Just slowly start to wake up your body, start to move your body, and then make your way back to the seated position. 

01:19:25
[sil.] 

01:19:30
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER So those are our activities today, we connect, we breathe, we move and practice focusing, we relax. And we have just a few more things to talk about before we close. Now finally… Oh, there's a question, sure, yeah? Oh, can read it? So the question is, how do you help the children not feel distracted by outside sounds for example, sounds in the building when supposed to notice sounds in the room when they are moving closer into layers? So it's a great question and also, are all of these poses listed in detail in your book? So great questions, thank you for sending them in, guys. Now this first question about the layers of sound practice, you know, in a mindfulness practice the idea is always to just notice what's happening around you, notice what's real, pay attention with kindness and curiosity to the present moment. So the idea of practicing layers of sound is that… I actually can't help a child sort of not be distracted by people screaming at each other outside in the hallway when they're "supposed to be listening to the sounds in the room" only they can do that, but the idea is were deliberately practicing noticing what's happening. So by practicing noticing the sounds in the room we have a better awareness of the fact that we're being distracted from the sounds in the room. So when those people start yelling at each other outside it's not a problem for that kid to be distracted by that. Usually if there's a big distracting sound that happens, I might say something like, "Notice if anything has distracted you." notice it and then when you're ready bring your attention back into the room right. If the idea is to notice not to like hard core do, so it doesn't take away from the activity at all if the kids have a hard time keeping their awareness within whichever layer they're umm… that you are leading now is not a problem if their mind gets distracted into the other layers as long as you're encouraging them to, encouraging them to notice what's happening for them. You'll notice as an adult practicing this you might get distracted by things in other layers but also you might say, "Oh, that bird is outside." I'm listening to the sounds in the room right now and notice your distraction and bring your attention back. You can also get distracted and maybe need to do the practice again say you're already listening to the sounds inside your body and then you hear something really far away that's very compelling maybe you can get quite back from way out here to right in here in one shot, maybe you need to say, "Alright, I got pulled out here again. Now I got to go here, here, here." The idea isn't to umm… narrow the scope of what they're supposed to be doing. The idea is to gain greater awareness of what's happening for us. I hope that helps okay. Then the other question of are these practices all detailed in my book. Umm… Some of them are some of them are exploring great detail of my book others aren't. Umm… If you have specific questions about that feel free to email me, I'll put my e-mail address up at the end, and if you have any questions about which practices are covered in there let me know. Umm… another good place to find additional practices is on the Little Flower yoga blog. If you go to the website littleflower.com and click on blog you'll see lots of blog posts of different practices that fall into all five of those elements. So that's a good free resource uh… without buying a book to get more activities and more detail on some of the ones we did today. Thanks for your questions. Okay, so the last thing I want to share with you is that in an effort to teach kids about inner resources, about their inner resources please don't forget the importance of connection, right? Connection is essential for all children but especially for those with ADHD, right, children with ADHD are used to feeling disconnected in a lot of situations their kids who are used to getting in trouble, they're used to feeling like they're annoying everyone around them umm… in a lot of cases kids with ADHD are used to feeling like a problem, and that is a big problem for the protective brain because when kids feel alone, when they feel isolated, when they feel like they're always about to get in trouble or do something they don't even want to do the protective brain stays really, really engaged. When our kids are feeling stressed, when they're feeling threatened, when they're feeling overwhelmed which happens quite a lot with our kids with ADHD the presence of a calm, compassionate, loving adult offers them this real source of strength, it offers them reassurance, it offers them a point of connection and a reminder that they have resources. Just because our kids have inner resources doesn't mean they should have to be using their own inner resources all the time. They also have external resources like family support systems that they should feel very comfortable and confident leaning on. Kids who know, who feel for sure like they have someone unconditionally on their side like someone's totally got their back can really walk more confidently and strongly into the world with less sympathetic nervous system over activation, less protective brain awareness. They can walk safely and securely into the world even when that person is not literally right by their side. So my point is just don't withhold connection support from your kids in an attempt to umm… teach them to deal on their own, right. They are kids and feeling connected, feeling supported, will actually give them more capacity to be okay when you're not right there. When you are there soothing them, supporting them, helping reassure the protective brain and disengage that sympathetic nervous system they carry those things forward but then even when you're not there. Give them tools, teach them about their inner resources but always remember that you are also a resource for this child. Don't withhold that resource uh… for the sake of trying to teach them to go it on their own. Here are some additional resources if this conversation has been interesting to you some books that I'd recommend umm… the first is a book called Scattered by Dr Gabor Maté. Umm… this is a book about ADHD. It's not about yoga or mindfulness. It's about understanding how ADHD develops. Umm… I found it to be one of the most the compelling exciting… insightful and accessible books that I've ever read on understanding the experience, the inner experience of a person with ADHD. I highly recommend it. Uh… my book, Little Flower Yoga for Kids uh… talks in much more detail about the protective brain and the thoughtful brain as well as the relationship between the body, the breath and the nervous system. And then of course has many activities within each of those five elements that uh… you can share with kids and teens. Umm… the book focus by Daniel Goldman is a wonderful resource and then also, A Still Quiet Place by Amy Saltzman. Umm… A Still Quiet Place is primarily mindfulness based practices for kids and teens. And it also comes with a great resource, which is a CD of guided meditations and guided practices that you could do on your own, that you can do with you're umm… with your kids, your clients, your students. My recommendation is that if you umm.. listen to the "Still Quiet Place" CD or really any other audio resource. I always think it's a good idea if possible, instead of playing those directly for your kids, that you as the adult use them as a resource to listen to, get comfortable with the practices, do the practices yourself, but then share them directly from you to the child. That gives you the opportunity to adapt them to meet the needs of each individual kid, and it also maintains the connection between you and the child whereas putting on a CD can be a little bit of a, a disconnector. Okay, well that's all for today. Oh, looks like we've got one more question and we do have a minute for it. Thank you. So how do you help children stay engaged particularly for the tense and let go practice and how do you handle them getting up in the middle of the practice? Thank you, Kayla. Okay, so I'm gonna pass this back. So the tense and let go practice I actually find to be pretty engaging umm… what's hard for kids is if you do uh… sort of a body scan without doing anything, so often you might say be in any yoga class and hear language like "Bring your awareness to your feet, now bring your awareness to your legs. Now bring your awareness to your belly." I find that the kids get really disengaged from that but the tense and let go practice where they're actually physically doing something they're physically squeezing a muscle and letting it go umm… I find the vast majority of the kids do really stay engaged with that practice. I don't have a ton of problems with kids like popping up off the floor in the middle of that practice. Now that being said, it is always possible for that to happen and some things that mitigate that uh… one of the most powerful is giving kids choices. Now it's a huge assumption to say, "Okay, everyone's gonna feel comfortable laying down on the floor on their back" for a wide variety of reasons including having an overprotective protective brain, that might not feel so safe or comfortable to a particular child increasing the likeliness that they disconnect from the activity and sit up. So I would say giving kids choices, when you're doing umm… for example, the tense and let go activity you can give them the same choices I gave you, lay down or stay sitting, right. Giving them power or giving them a choice is something that helps them be more engaged, and then also staying connected to each individual child, you know, I keep a close, close eye on the kids that I'm working with, and I can see if they're getting kind of fidgety or peeking or looking around. I might go a little bit more quickly or if they're really, really sinking into it. I'm gonna slow down and hold back a little and give them longer, and then finally if I have a kid, who's really struggling I might try a kind of the old "Let me just go sit next to you" trick. but I, if I do that, right, if I walk over to a kid and sit down next to them like a kid who's struggling a little I have to make sure that everything in my attitude, my intention, my body is sending the message of "I'm here to give you loving support" not "I'm here to watch you and make sure you don't do something bad" Okay? You have to be very, very clear in yourself, the intention that you're approaching the kid with, it's got to feel like support not feel like kind of oversight or reprimand, and then within all of that I remember that one of my primary purposes is to help kids connect to their own internal sense of their needs and their experiences. So if it's not working I always emphasize to the kids all the time if something doesn't feel right you, pause, stop, check it out, and make a decision about how to move forward. And at any time, if one of these practices isn't working for you, sit up or take a break or do something different, because ultimately we're trying to teach them to recognize and act on their own needs rather than kind of stuff their own internal experiences and sensations and follow the directions of an external agent. Right, these practices are only meaningful if we can fully offer them to our kids as their own and then if they can absorb them and integrate them and use them in their own life. So if a kid needs to sit up, they need to sit up. If they need to be done, they need to be done. There's always tomorrow. All right. Thank you so much, everybody. This is my contact info if you want or need to get in touch, I'd be happy to hear from…
