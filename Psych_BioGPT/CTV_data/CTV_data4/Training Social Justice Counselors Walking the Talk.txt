Training Social Justice Counselors "Walking the Talk" 

00:00:00
Featuring Fred Bemak, ED.D., Rita Chi-Ying Chung, Ph.D., Allen Ivey, Ed.D., and George Mason University Counseling Students 

00:00:00
Dr. Mark Ginsberg Dean, School of Education and Human Development at George Mason University 

00:00:55
DR. MARK GINSBERG The College of Education and Human Development at George Mason University is a college that is committed to a series of core values that are essential, uh, to defining who we are by explaining to the world about what we are and by which our training programs have been built and operate. One of the most essential of the core values that we share as a faculty, that we embed in our college's programs is the principle of social justice. And so, as we think about constructing a program in counseling and development it's quite natural but actually vitally essential that social justice be the underpinning of the conceptual frameworks, the operational frameworks and the practical training that our students receive. And so, social justice is not just something we talk about, not just something we believe in, it's a concept that we deeply embed in all that we do. And I think that's part and parcel of what makes George Mason University what it is. And I think it's part and parcel of what makes our counseling and development programs the national model that they've become. 

00:01:50
Dr. Allen E. Ivey Distinguished University Professor Emeritus, University of Massachusetts, Amherst 

00:01:55
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Fred and Rita, thank you for coming today. Again it's a real honor to work with you, uh, I guess today we're gonna look at the issues of social justice and its relationship to the counseling field. I don't guess, I know, uh, you two have been really prominent leaders making things happen. And, I think the general opinion around the country is the program in George Mason University is the clearest and most outstanding in the country. So this is our chance to share definitions of social justice and its relationship to the counseling field with really two critical leaders who are really, truly making a difference. I know about your incredible work in trauma, I know your incredible work overseas, your work with Katrina. But all of this comes from a social justice perspective. So let's start, my own feeling is that social justice is part and parcel of every individual counseling interview, every group counseling interview, every family interview, every community intervention. Uh, however, that intervention can be probably anti-social justice or pro-social justice. I will argue that all counseling basically can be social justice. But what is it? What is social justice? And you are the guys to define it, tell me about it. 

00:03:15
Dr. Fred Bemak Dr. Rita Chi-Ying Chung Counseling and Development, George Mason University 

00:03:20
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Well, we're really looking at equity issues. You know? Um, and looking make sure that there is, um, fair access to resources, to ser-, services for everyone, regardless of your race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation so on. Um, I think that there are a lot of inequity issues carrying on in the U.S. and all you need to do is look at some of the statistics in terms of who are in our prisons, who is failing in our schools, who are not getting equal treatment in our medical field and so on. 

00:03:55
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY When you mention that word inequity, I know immediately, uh, that'll turn some, that very word will turn come people off. Uh, I would go back and might ask you to reflect a little bit on this in terms of Carl Rogers and that word relationship. And if is anybody was ever for equity, it was Carl Rogers, his work in Northern Ireland. He really was the, an important social justice activist. So, I think some counselors are kind of frightened by some of the things you might say. And I find it very much in tradition of Carl Rogers, I find it very much in tradition of our original founder Frank Parsons. If we go back historically there are many, many figures that are saying what you've said. So, I'd like to hear a little bit more about the idea of the equity and how really, it really is how can we help people become more what they want to become in a fair situation. 

00:04:45
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Exactly, I mean, we need to look at the roots of our, uh, profession, as you mentioned in terms of looking at Frank Parsons and all the other folks, who were actually, were looking at advoca-, advocating for the mentally ill. I mean, what is, what is the aim of our profession? And I think one of our aims is to make sure that our clients, their families and communities, sort of, we're looking at psychological well being and the ability to have maximum growth and development. And how can you have maximum growth and development and have a healthy well being, if you are discriminated against? If you don't have equal access to resources, uh, to treatment, um, services and so on. 

00:05:30
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY So, that word helping, and helping really is helping others become what they want to become. If we're going to be helpers, uh, we really are concerned with raising the boat, helping everybody become what they could become, but go a little farther, Fred, where do you go with this. 

00:05:45
DR. FRED BEMAK We're, in addition to what Rita's saying. We are looking constantly, and I think counselors have to do this, and psychologists have to do this. We are looking constantly at leveling the playing field, in terms of power, in terms of privilege, in terms of opportunity. Um, and social justice does that, it helps to level the playing field. To sit as a counselor or psychologist and work with someone who's being discriminated against, for example, and to say let me help you adapt to that situation. Doesn't make any sense at all, what we have to do is look at the much larger picture and the influences on that individual about what's going on in there right, that's not fair, that's not just, that's not equity, that's not equal, that's not, uh, providing the same opportunity for that person as everyone else. Not just how is your mental health, do you feel OK in a, in a horrible situation. 

00:06:50
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG We're basically talking about, basic human rights. 

00:06:50
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Basic human rights. 

00:06:50
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG To make sure that everyone, um, has the ability to get the basic human rights. 

00:06:55
DR. FRED BEMAK And the same equal rights, human rights. 

00:07:00
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG And the same equal rights, exactly. 

00:07:00
DR. FRED BEMAK I would say that social justice is fundamental to counseling, it's not a piece of counseling, I think it's the bottom foundation for what we are doing and that if, uh, as Rita said before we come back to advocacy of Clifford Beers (ph) or we come back to Frank Parsons, we come back to our origins about advocacy we've lost some of that over the years as we've become more conservative in the profession and more traditional. And I think we have to come back to our roots and think of that as part and parcel of what we do in counseling. 

00:07:35
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Somewhere we've got down the road for some recent social justice issues have been put into the background and well, we think we need to bring it back into the fore, forefront. Um, we just can't address the issues of how you feel, or your feelings without looking at the larger context. Like if we're focusing just on your feelings I feel that we're just band-aiding the situation. 

00:08:00
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Could you just share a couple examples of places where you've had people you've worked with, uh, which need to become aware of the social and contextual issues underlying their issues, underlying the problem. So called problems, challenges, things they face. 

00:08:10
DR. FRED BEMAK I was working, one example, I can think of, I went in and I was consulting in a school, I had a grant, to, to work in a high school and the, the, and said we'll work with the students that are at the highest levels of failure as is, as is systematic across the country the students who were immediately referred very quickly by teachers were students of color and the students came and we started to do a group intervention with these students to talk about issues going on for them. They had, had many programs before about academic performance, and waking up on time to get to school on time and attendance, none of those programs had worked. We set down and said, "What's going on in your life?" What's happening, this is a, all of you are struggling in school. Tell us about it. All these issues of inequity started to come out, I'm discriminated against, this teacher is doing things to the Latino students in the class that they don't do to the other students. This teacher is working with Asians in this way, this teacher is working with African Americans and as we started to hear these stories and share these stories. We didn't say, gee, let's figure out how you can feel better, in that situation and not feel so hurt when this teacher is doing and saying things that are hurtful and, and prejudicial. 

00:09:35
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY So, a part of social justice really is assessing where they're really coming from, where they're really making meaning, go ahead. 

00:09:40
DR. FRED BEMAK Yeah, yeah, exactly in that social context. 

00:09:40
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG But also, looking at the root of the problem. 

00:09:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY The root of the problem, mm-hmm. 

00:09:45
DR. FRED BEMAK The root. And so, as we talked about it we began to talk about their disempowerment. They began to discuss that the principal at a certain point said, "I am not going to have any extra-curricular activities in this school, from now on we are just having study halls." The students in the group said, "This is the most meaningful part of my week and my grades are changing. I don't want to stop this so the students banded together, these students who were tot-, completely marginalized in the school and wrote a letter some misspellings granted, but a letter to the principal to say please don't disband our group, here are the reasons why and they all wrote it together and signed it. They were the only group in the school that was allowed to continue. But that kind of experience of empowerment, that sense of, uh, having an understanding about their history, that led them to that place. The context of what was happening for them and appreciating that rather than saying, please adjust, was a completely different experience. This is one example of many. 

00:10:50
[sil.] 

00:10:50
Empowerment and the Counseling Process: Why is it so important and how does it relate to Social Justice and Advocacy? 

00:11:00
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG The word empowerment, I know, has been used, has been thrown around, but we are talking about authentic empowerment. I think some people talk about, oh, I've just empowered my clients. Well, what does that mean? 

00:11:10
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Well, what did you do specifically? 

00:11:10
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Right, right. And so, so, what we're talking about empowerment or authentic empowerment we're really talking about, about them getting a sense of themselves and a sense of not only hope but also a sense that they can take action. That they're not relying on the counselor we're not setting up that co-dependent unhealthiness. But we're really working in ??teams that our clients will, we leave our clients with tools, uh, with advocacy tools a sense that they have purpose, a sense that they have control, a sense that they can create change for themselves and for the community. 

00:11:45
DR. FRED BEMAK I think that everybody is onboard with empowerment. I also thin that people aren't really doing it. And, and Rita and I have used this term authentic, I want to underscore, authentic empowerment. I can't tell you how many groups I've seen and I wind up consulting in different places and seeing, working with counselors, psychologists and I, and I see a number of people say OK this is your group, you have control, you can talk about what you want but sit down not now. Don't interrupt, stop that, sit down. And so, we really in very, very significant ways in our profession we disempower people while having the rhetoric about empowering people. 

00:12:25
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Now, you have taken this material into the curriculum here. And, what do we do to infuse social justice throughout our curriculum? It has some challenges, I would argue. Uh, and I think that, uh, professors, uh, will be a little bit, how can we do this in a way? Our textbooks don't always talk about these issues. How do you, how do you, how do you teach, how do you infuse social justice throughout the curriculum? I understand that's something you're very good at. 

00:12:55
DR. FRED BEMAK We encourage students who are not aligned with our mission to go elsewhere. We are very clear about our value system, about social justice and multiculturalism, we are very clear about the students we want to attract, we're very clear about admissions and taking students inline with that. So, it begins there, in the courses I would suggest to any program in the country that is looking at this it takes time, energy and work. It is a process to work from a social justice, multicultural curriculum. We spent two years, in retreats as a faculty defining our mission and every student in the program knows the mission, quite interestingly, it's not something on the shelf that people don't look at. Every student knows the mission, social justice, multiculturalism leadership advocacy in internationalism. Every student knows that, every student from the first class on is able to walk around with that. That mission drives our curriculum. After spending two years working on who will we, how will we define that? How will we put that together as collective faculty? We then sat down and revamped 95% of the curriculum. We took every course and said, it takes a lot of time, sat down and said how is social justice, how is multiculturalism infused in this class? From foundations class to human growth and development to career courses to diagnosis to practicum and internship. Every single class we have, that's the absolute foundation of that training. 

00:14:35
Regine Tallyrand Associate Professor and Program Coordinator, Counseling and Development George Mason University 

00:14:35
REGINE TALLYRAND I've been here for 10 years, kind of, and we've been recreating the program for the past 10 years. And as I mentioned before it's really been a labor of love, but a lot of hard work, too. And so, starting early on I was, um, trying to recreate the assessment class. How do I infuse social justice into a class that teaches about assessments? And looking to talk about test bias and are these tests culturally relevant? Um, do they apply to all populations? So, that was a challenge I had. How do I take this class, this traditional counseling class, and make it much more relevant for the populations we serve today? Um, also and I think for me in the career class that it's been one of the biggest contributions I have made to the program in infusing or integrating into the class a service learning project. Where our students get to go outside of the classroom and provide career counseling to a range of populations that truly need and are hungry for this type of work. I've had students go, um, to work with the homeless, different homeless shelters, to work with individuals who were previously incarcerated. To work with mom's who, um, no longer were able to keep their children because of their substance abuse, um, issues. So, a range of populations, alternative high school youth, and I think was challenging for our students but also the most rewarding is that they have to really step outside of this traditional box of counseling and, um, think about how can I provide the most culturally relevant care to this population. You know using the Myers-Briggs or the Strong Interest Inventory or the SDS won't work with this population we need to find other tools that will just be, will be as useful. 

00:16:15
Rachael Goodman Assistant Professor, Counseling and Development George Mason University 

00:16:15
RACHAEL GOODMAN In a similar way to what Dr. Tallyrand was talking about with the assessment. Of course, I'm teaching the research course, um, and I think one of the things that's been really fun about that course is that it's one of the earliest courses that the students take in the program. And I've been able to, really from day one to talk about social justice and multicultural issues as they relate to research. And students are really excited and interested in that, because they know that, that's a part of the program. So, we talk about research, we talk about how it can be and has been used to marginalize people but how it can also be used to liberate. That it can be used to empower, um, the students and the clients that they're working with. So, I think that's been really fun to try to take research which can be kind of dry and sometimes intimidating and disconnecting and try to really teach it in a way that students feel like they can integrate it into their practice and they feel excited. They're in the conceptualization stages of the action research, so we talk about it, we talk about examples. Um, I bring in examples from real life situations, like with the Arizona law, the law in Arizona, um, that legalized racial profiling. So, we talk about, um, you know, what that law might have meant to the community. And, how if you were a counselor in that community you night go about designing an action research program. What kind of information would you need? Um, really focusing on not making assumptions about what people need, but using your counseling skills to figure out how you would investigate to find out what they need. 

00:17:45
REGINE TALLYRAND In our practicum internship classes, our student are tasked to create prevention programs. So, along with providing counseling to their clients they also have to come up with ways to provide some prevention interventions at their sites which is a surprise, I think, to their, um, organizations, too. They're not ready to have these students coming in, bring about some change in their organization. But, I think, um, it's a challenge for students, but I think they end the course feeling, um, very empowered. I remember one student, um, who was working with, um, substance abusing women, um, some had been incarcerated, some not. And she realized that, and one of their major stressors was not having work. So, she developed and realized at the site they were not providing any type of career counseling. They were dealing with issues of addiction, but not providing any kind of career counseling. So, she infused that into the model that they were using. Which was great because that was something they needed. In order to make them happy, they had to find work. In order to find some peace and not be so stressed their clients needed to find some type of work. So, she was able to develop a manual and also provide career counseling to the clients there, on top of the regular counseling they were receiving. 

00:19:00
RACHAEL GOODMAN Having a program that really is designed around social justice makes such a difference for the students. I mean, I see them, I feel like I learn so much from them. In my courses because they're able to bring up the issues that are meaningful for them. We're not just teaching from a textbook that only has one perspective, one Euro-centric perspective about the way things should be. Um, people are, the students are able to bring in their lived experiences. The clients are able to have those experiences, as a part of our training, by doing things like outreach. So, I think it's such a, it's such a rich learning experience, all the way around, I think. 

00:19:40

00:19:40
Drs. George McMahon and Joseph Williams are new faculty members at George Mason University. They discuss why they were drawn to George Mason's Counseling Program, surprises they have encountered in their first year, and their passion for the mission of the program... 

00:19:40
Dr. George McMahon Assistant Professor 

00:19:50
DR. GEORGE MCMAHON Well, well for me the primary motivation in coming in here was, uh, or what attracted me to George Mason was the social justice focus, both in terms of the counseling program, the training that the Masters students were getting. But also the, I'd been following I guess for a while, the literature that was being put out by a lot of the professors. And what, um, really impressed was, what really impressed me was, um, not just what they were writing about but how much they were doing. That it wasn't just writing about social justice, it was, it was really social action. 

00:20:25
Dr. Joseph Williams Assistant Professor 

00:20:25
DR. JOSEPH WILLIAMS One of the biggest draws was, uh, to the program here at George Mason was the faculties involvement with the gay scholarships and, uh, by that, I mean, working to the community with outreach, counseling, uh, social justice advocacy. Uh, they started counselors without borders here, so, for me this is one of few programs if not the only program that was actually going beyond the rhetoric of, uh, uh, social justice and multiculturalism. But was actually putting those type of, um, uh, terminologies into practice. So, that's, um, a field or a program that I really wanted to be associated with. 

00:21:00
DR. GEORGE MCMAHON The one thing that I was pleasantly surprised about was how the social justice focus, uh, isn't limited just to the counseling program, um, that it does go across the College of Education. And I've already met several folks from different programs within the college, that really buy into the mission of social justice and are interested in counseling that we've been able to collaborate with, particularly in schools. 

00:21:20
DR. JOSEPH WILLIAMS It's really about making sure not only, um, that faculty members are on board but also our colleges, uh, our deans are great, they're very, they're really supportive. They, uh, promote, uh, what we do here and they support what we do here. So, again it's, it's, it's such a system effort, it's such a team effort when you're talking about, uh, starting a program, uh, built around social justice and multiculturalism you have to have, uh, multiple players, I guess, on the team in order to be successful. 

00:21:45
DR. GEORGE MCMAHON Um, the other thing that, uh, uh, that I was surprised about was, um, not just the knowledge base of the students, but the openness and the enthusiasm for social justice that it's something that it's not just another aspect of their coursework. It's really something they get passionate about and the timing of this is interesting cause I, I just had a final class, um, last week and I actually thanked the class for validating my choice to come here. Because of that passion and that enthusiasm, I mentioned to them that, I was here to work with students who could really get into social justice and reading their papers was really validating of my decision to come here. 

00:22:25
Applications in Social Justice Counselor Training: Classroom Without Walls FRED BEMAK AND RITA CHI-YING CHUNG The article addresses an innovative approach to promote social justice counseling and advocacy training in graduate counseling programs. The classroom without walls concept involves traditional counseling practices and field-based experiences, supervision, and mentoring that go beyond the walls of traditional classrooms to help national and international graduate counseling programs more effectively incorporate social justice pedagogy to build a more humanistic, equitable, just and harmonious society. The counseling profession has been challenged to address social justice and advocacy issues in counselor education training programs (Bemak & Chung, 2005, 2007, 2008b; D'Andrea, Foster, & Pedersen, 2008; Kiselica & Robinson, 2001; Lewis, Arnold, House, & Toporek, 2002; Ratts, Toporek, & Lewis, 2010). Growing interest in these areas is reflected in the significant increase in workshops and presentations made on social justice counseling and advocacy issues at professional conventions and conferences as well as in the significant increase in publications and Internet resources on these topics. As a result of the increasing interest in social justice issues in the mental health professions, the American Counseling Association (ACA) and the American Psychological Association (APA) established task forces and committees that are designed to address a broad range of topics in this area. All of this activity validates the suggestion that... 

00:22:25
DR. FRED BEMAK Rita and I just wrote a piece that's coming out, um, soon, called, "Classrooms Without Walls," social justice training. And we're looking at how do you extend traditional training to infuse social justice and multiculturalism. 

00:22:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY OK. 

00:22:45
DR. FRED BEMAK We have projects in our program where students are out working in the community doing volunteer social justice work as well as classroom assignments for that. Um, it's, it's something the students are growing up with and it, and living with and so they become very well-versed in this. And learn it's not just sitting in a classroom reading a book learning a theory, it's how do we apply this to this community. I remember one situation, um, when we were working in the African American community and we're working with disenfranchised parents, we actually, for someone's birthday, brought a cake to their house and sat on the porch in the neighborhood. This was part of the counseling, without that we would never have established a rapport and relationships that are necessary. 

00:23:30
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG And also, I think that in terms of we as counselors and psychologists in training. We need to model, we need to be role models for our, for our, uh, students. We shouldn't just talk the talk, but we should also, the students should be able to observe us actually, walk the talk. And to do that we also need to be creative and flexible and have courage to go against the norm and again when going against the norm not only in the that best training and practice but also gonna be the best outcome for our client's. 

00:24:00
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY So, as we wind up, think about the future. What would you like to see us doing? Uh, um, I mean, we could go on forever with the two of you with the wonderful work but I'm gonna have, I know the time is up so we're gonna have to ask you for what you have to say. Kinda like time for a commercial, you know. So, before the commercial break, uh, uh, what would you like to add? There's so much more but I, I, you know. 

00:24:25
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG I mean, I would, just real brief, I would like to see every counseling and psychology program infuse social justice in the curriculum. In all aspects of the curriculum, not just to have the, the one elective course or to have the annual conference. Which is great, but to have it totally infused and just imagine if all of us, whether you are students in training or counselors or psychologists to go out and give back to the community. Think about how many thousands of us actually doing work in terms of undoing all the social injustices that have been done over time. 

00:25:00
DR. FRED BEMAK I, I often times hear, um, colleagues say I can't do it, I'm alone with social justice. It's my value, I'm alone with the focus on diversity. I think we have to figure out, what, how much of an impact can we have. Is it only our classroom? That's a start. It, can we get, is there one more colleague we can bring onboard? That's better. Are there three more colleagues that would get in line? Are there some students that are interested in participating in multicultural social justice activities? Um, can we change two courses, not one, not just mine? I think we have to look at those issues in the larger systemic, uh, venue. And figure out where do we go with that and how far can we extend it? We're in an opportune moment, we're in an economic crunch, services are being cut, there aren't enough people to provide counseling services in our communities. We found that any agency we call and say we're here we're interested in social justice multicultural interventions. We have students that want to learn. We have faculty that will offer time for supervision. You have needs, let's get married. 

00:26:20
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Practicum opportunities 

00:26:20
DR. FRED BEMAK There it is, and even course opportunities. Exactly, and so, our times are conducive to social justice work. 

00:26:25
Why are Social Justice and Multiculturalism important to counseling? George Mason Students respond... 

00:26:30
[sil.] 

00:26:30
Reston Bell 

00:26:30
RESTON BELL I think there are a lot of small, subtle, um, messages that we communicate that we're so unaware of, and I think that the way multiculturalism and advocacy and social justice have really been infused into our program to really kind of bring out those subtle messages that we communicate, and I think it's, it's important for that. So that we're not just well-intentioned, but we're well-equipped. You know, when we go out into the field. 

00:26:55
Diana Ortiz 

00:26:55
DIANA ORTIZ Well, I think that it's, absolutely necessary, uh, um, our society is growing and it's changing every day so it's not a luxury anymore. It's something that we all need to know. 

00:27:05
Lewis Forrest III 

00:27:10
LEWIS FORREST III I think it's important, uh, we sometimes make a lot of assumptions about what we know, coming into programs. Um, but having multiculturalism and social justice in the program as coursework really challenges you to think about some of the misconceptions that you may have about yourself and how the world operates and to push you, to have coursework that really pushes you beyond the academic side, almost to the personal side. Uh, I think is very important. 

00:27:35
Casey Quigley 

00:27:40
CASEY QUIGLEY I agree with Lewis, I think it's really important to educate yourself on different cultures, um, you know I've worked in the field for a couple of years. I haven't seen the same client twice, um, you see a lot of diverse cultures, a lot of diverse backgrounds and it's really important to be educated about where they're coming from and maybe things that you might encounter when you're working with them or their families. 

00:28:00
Blake O'Farrow 

00:28:00
BLAKE O'FARROW Before I got into the program, I just thought counseling was this amorphous being or entity. But then with multicultural counseling, social justice it gave it some boundaries. It made it real, um, it, it made me realize that I'm dealing with real people with differences. So it just gave me a sense of perspective that I didn't have before I came into the program. 

00:28:30
Friday Oeur 

00:28:30
FRIDAY OEUR I'm so very into the program but I know, I knew from the very first class in foundations that this was something that we needed to know and we needed to know as much as we possibly could about many different cultures. Cause if we didn't we were not going to be the best professional that we could be. 

00:28:55

How has the George Mason University counseling program, with its social justice and multiculturalism focus, affected you as a person and a professional? 

00:28:55
Candace Fleming 

00:28:55
CANDACE FLEMING Um, but my aha moment was sitting in my multicultural class, um, multicultural counseling and they held up a list of names and the first name Dr. Chung put up, it was a long list and no one recognized any of the names and then she put up another list and people started to recognize the names. It was like Elizabeth Smart, um, it was names of young women who had disappeared or, uh, missing. But the difference between the two lists, the list that people recognized the name, you know, they were young, caucasian, or white women or children. And the first list was, you know, minority women and I was devastated, um, after this class. And I shared with my professor, Dr. Chung because I have two small children. Now I get a little emotional, and I thought my children would be on that first list that no one knew the names of. So, that was my aha moment of realizing as an African American woman you're very well aware of racism, I mean, you know, just part of your every day life. But that just hit home that time so that was my aha moment. And you know I trusted the process and worked my way through that. But that was a really powerful moment for me. Just realizing where the society that I live in and what's valued and what's not.

Enrique Fernandez 

00:30:15
ENRIQUE FERNANDEZ Growing up Hispanic, um, I look, I don't look Hispanic, um, so that was something I came to realize that I had an issue with, um, I remember when I was younger I used to kind of be embarrassed about being Hispanic because I was different from everybody else. Um, and I kind of came into my own growing up and I revisited those issues again, while I was taking that multicultural class. Um, and it was kind of a struggle for me because I realized I didn't have that connection with other Hispanic youth. Um, because I didn't look like that, I didn't share the same experiences, that they might be going through now as immigrants or Hispanic, because of the way, their appearance. Um so that was kind of the issue I was dealing with. Um, but Dr. Chung helped me realize that I can use that to my advantage. That I can use my appearance to kind of transcend the lines go back and forth and kind of speak out for them, and um, and advocate for them. 

00:31:10
Amie Charley 

00:31:10
AMIE CHARLEY The program here offers so many ways to, uh, self explore that I was able to learn a lot about myself in the multicultural class, and social justice course that I took. Um, being a biracial, female who was raised Jewish, I've had all kinds of issues of trying to fit in and, um, understanding that the diversity should be embraced and celebrated, as opposed to, uh, looking at the differences and pointing them out and trying to categorize people by their physical appearance. Uh, it, it, the lessons are invaluable is the best I can say. 

00:31:50
Casey Quigley 

00:31:50
CASEY QUIGLEY In our foundations class with, uh, Dr. Bemak we were talking about stereotypes which is something that we talk a lot about in the program. And, I don't remember exactly what I said, but it was something about, you know, I think stereotypes have a truth to them. And, you know, he kind of looked at me, you know, where did you, where did that come from for you. Nobody's ever asked me that before and I really, um, really thought about it, like, I don't know where that came from I just always thought, not that stereotypes are true for everyone but I thought maybe they had a basis to them. And that, that's when it really started for me to start challenging, well why do you think that? Who taught you that, where did you learn it and is it true? 

00:32:25
Krystle Dorsey 

00:32:25
KRYSTLE DORSEY Because I grew up mostly in a multicultural environment, um, myself, um, I had always wanted to reach out into multicultural communities and my own specific backgrounds. And so, but I had thought about counseling in a way that was just one on one in a office. Um, I thought about the counseling in a traditional way, but once I got into group I realized the social impact of healing and what counseling can really be outside of the norm. 

00:32:55
Fatma Mekki 

00:32:55
FATMA MEKKI And I say the journey does not end, uh, end by graduating. You know, you carry the mission, you know the advocacy, the leadership, the multiculturalism you continue that in your work and you educate others. That's the really big mission, you know, the program really prepares you very well and I had a lot of comments, not about me, but many students who had graduated from this program. That they are very confident, very competent, even compared to people who have been in the field for many years. 

00:33:20
Jan Weng 

00:33:25
JAN WENG Our greatest gift, um, to counseling, is our ability to relate to our clients. That the statistics show that whatever modality you use: person-centered, counseling, behavior management, gestalt; doesn't have as much impact as your ability to establish a safe relationship with your client. And I got that from the program and not only did it help me professionally but it helped me with my wife. 

00:33:55
Jackie Scott-Bell 

00:34:00
JACKIE SCOTT-BELL And this program has really affected my whole family, my husband, my two children. Um, I come home and I talk about what I learned in each one of my classes. And it's so funny because when my kids write papers for school, they always, somehow end up writing about multiculturalism. And my husband, who's a, um, news journalist has started using, we talk a lot here in our program about world views. And when I told them actually what a world view was, he started incorporating it into his stories, his news stories. And then his friends, who he talked to, who are also journalists, incorporated it into their own stories. 

00:34:35
Guelila Fornetti 

00:34:35
GUELILA FORNETTI Learning about theories and ways to counsel is important, um, but again what I love about this program is that you are, you learn how to, you learn about yourself, and then you take that to meet your client where they are. And you're not doing it in a phony way. You're not taking a book and there's no manual to how to be culturally competent. You can read about a culture and get to, try to get to know the culture as much as you can but you're never gonna know everything about that culture. And that's OK, um, but knowing that you are accepting, knowing that you're willing to, uh, meet the client where they are is what they teach you. 

00:35:20

00:35:20
As a Classroom exercise, Dr. Chung assigns their graduate students a "character" they must study and embody. This exercise is incredibly powerful in helping students learn about various populations and worldviews. Here are some of their stories... 

00:35:20
Amy Gleason Carroll 

00:35:20
AMY GLEASON CARROLL I think it was social justice that we, um, chose a character or were given a character by Dr. Chung. And mine was one, uh, um, immigrant from Cuba. um, I think doing that assignment and reflecting upon it continuously throughout the program and even after I graduated has changed the way I view the world. And I can give you an example of that. Um, in 2005, Herndon, Virginia created a day labor site at the end of my street. I was the vice president of my home owners association at that time and in that capacity I testified or spoke up against, um, the day labor site, um, at the town Council meeting in Herndon, because as the homeowners association representative I felt like I didn't want 100 men walking through my neighborhood that wouldn't be there otherwise. Um, the experience of researching the immigrant experience in the U.S. through that class and learning about the Cuban immigrants and then learning about other waves of Latino immigrants. Um, changed the way I view the world fundamentally, I'm ashamed that in 2005 I took that stance and I, my world view at the time was that this wasn't in my communities best interest. Now when I look at the men, um, who are riding their bikes and walking. I can't view them without, um, understanding that they've risked so much to come to this country. Um, that their pre-migration and post-migration trauma, um, the work that they're doing that discrimination they face here, uh, that they could be abused by the employers, taken advantage of. Um, and so I'm really an advocate for immigrant rights. Um, and interested in working with immigrant students and have embarked on a Doctoral study here at the university, um, because I'm very interested in serving under-represented children, um, in the school system. And not only trying to, um, bring them up to white middle class acculturation but also to change the schools and the curriculum and the counseling services we provide to, um, better advocate and be more fitting to the students we have in the classrooms. So, I wasn't aware that it was that assignment, um, that changed my world view, I thought it was the entire program. But I can really bring it back to that one assignment and the further research which I did throughout the program that really has changed the very way I think about, um, who I am in the world, um, and those around me. 

00:38:15
Chris Cady 

00:38:20
CHRIS CADY Um, in our social justice class when we had to become a character. Adopt a character for several weeks and we have various assignments on them. For me my character was Brian, who was an African American, homosexual male. And, to truly become that character and identify with him and experience the hardships and criticisms against him even from people within their own culture. Was really also very eye opening for me. It made me recognize both as an individual and professionally how somebody from your own culture, your own race might have biases against you as well. So, that was, I think that made me grow as an individual. 

00:39:05
Candace Fleming 

00:39:05
CANDACE FLEMING We had character roles that we have to do and I was Cathy who was a 34-year-old woman who had lost her job and began prostituting to support herself so. Diving into that, doing the research, um, it just clicked. This is advocating, you know, I, you know, would talk to my family members about this is what my character is and do you know the statistics for this, that and the other. Do you know what's going on? I became really involved in it. It finally clicked this is, this is the right profession for me. 

00:39:40

00:39:40
What advice do you have for others in counseling programs? 

00:39:40
Chris Cady 

00:39:40
CHRIS CADY I would say, that for future students or professors is to keep themselves open. Keep themselves open to various ideas, um, new people, their views, and really take a chance. Take a chance with, uh, what you might, you know, some biases that you might have and put it out there and it's, if the space is right then it'll be the safest place that you can use to explore that.

Hollie Jones, a graduate of the counseling program at George Mason, describes the profound changes she experienced during her time there... 

00:40:15
Hollie Jones 

00:40:25
HOLLIE JONES I started the program, thinking that I was going to be a school counselor. And that I was going to help children and help them emotionally and help their families. And then the semester that I took social justice, everything sort of changed for me at that point. When I started the program I did not ever look at myself as a blond, white female and I had never thought about what other people thought of me being blond, being white, being short, being from the south. Uh, it had occurred to me that, that would have affected other people and it never occurred to me that, um, people had a view of me beforehand. I wore blinders until George Mason. 

00:41:10
[sil.] 

00:41:10
Hollie was so changed by Social Justice class that she took at George Mason, that she started to call her family after each class. 

00:41:15
HOLLIE JONES It took a lot of courage to call every night but it became a habit. That after I left class, I would need to call my mom and digress and unload everything that I had just sat in class with and at first she was a little thrown back because my grandparents and my parents, who were helping me get through grad school didn't expect me to go through school, um, and have this happen. you know, I think they thought I was just gonna be a school counselor. Smiles and smooth sailing and here I am calling to talk about, um, you know, social justice and what needs to be done. And how they're a part of this problem that needs to be advocated for. And telling my mom that she was part of the problem was a big thing. I think it's intimidating for parents to have their child come to them and talk to them about things. That number one, they've not ever talked about. In their life, in their parents' life they've not ever discussed the issue on hand and so it's uncomfortable. Through time, um, they start to hear me. I started to get emails back. I started to get comments back on articles that I would send, and I was sending them daily. And I'll never forget the first time my mom in a car we were looking for a house for my sister and my sister made a comment about the neighborhood and asked if it was an OK, if my mom felt safe in the neighborhood. And my mom made a comment, in regards to it shouldn't matter, who lives here and it was the first time my mom had ever said something that was advocating against racial profiling or, you know, social class profiling of any kind and I started crying in the backseat of our car because it was the first time verbally and she wasn't doing it to say look at me. And be proud of me, just I'm consciously making this comment. 

00:43:05
[sil.] 

00:43:05
Hollie took her passion for social justice education beyond her family and into the workplace and business sector... 

00:43:05
HOLLIE JONES Advocating became addicting. Anytime I could point out apparent or call it apparent. And I can remember getting in trouble with my principal, for, um, advocating for a cafeteria worker. Um, who was Asian and there was a student who would mock her as he went through the line and I will never forget talking to that parent on the phone and accusing the student of making a racist comment to the cafeteria worker. And then, uh, sort of getting slapped on the wrist by my principal, my boss for making the assumption of a student, a first grader. Um, and at that point I realized I then needed to advocate to my principal. I had a very close friend join the program, uh, that was African American and we would sort of test out what would happen in a restaurant and what would happen in a store if we walked in together. And that to me was shocking, um, and sad. So, that sort of gave me a voice and at that point I realized that people would listen to a blond white girl more so than they would an African American female of the same age. And if that meant that I then had to be a voice to advocate, to call out someone who was listening to me and not my African American friend who was just as equally qualified to sit and give an answer as I was then that was gonna be my job to do that. After the program at Mason , and during the program at Mason I became addicted and I am addicted to advocacy. Um, in my job with my family, with my friends, um, during the program while I was trying to make a change with my family. I was also in a relationship, um, and I would cry with my mom on the phone, on the walk to the car, in the car on the phone still and then go home and still need to sort of unload all of what had been, happening for me in class, um, and I can remember the relationship, we would, it started out all right, I was going back to school, I was getting my masters degree in counseling and then race came up, and racial jokes were addressed and, uh, it came to the point, where I couldn't even watch TV shows any more, I would get so angry. And we through time grew very far apart because I became more educated on social justice, and race, and cultures, and ethnicity, and there came a point were I mentally needed to take myself to a different level that, um, the person that I was dating at the time just was not ready to go, and it created a huge divide between the two of us and we are no longer together. Uh, after the program, during the program we had split and gone our separate ways just because there was a big divide, uh, between our belief system. I cannot live with not advocating for people and things and issues that happen. I cannot keep my mouth closed. It's a need to make a, make a change, even if it's a little change, even if it's to raise an eyebrow for five seconds. You have raised an eyebrow for five seconds. 

00:46:35
Dr. Mark Ginsberg Dean, School of Education and Human Development at George Mason University 

00:46:35
DR. MARK GINSBERG I would say that, uh, that incorporating the social justice model within counseling and development, and graduate programs around the country. It's not some thing that deans should do, it is something that deans could do. Uh, but more importantly it's something that deans and directors of programs must do. Uh, this is not a matter of, of, of, choice it's really a matter of necessity. If professionals in the counseling field are going to appropriately and successfully serve the diversity of population that is living in our country and that is living literally throughout the world. Uh, then we really have no other choice it's not a matter of preference, it's not a matter of style, it's a matter of doing the right thing for the right reasons and preparing future professionals in the professional counseling field to be successful in their work. And I think that as programs look around the country at what's happening in counseling development at George Mason University they'll see, a series of courses, they'll see an integrated program of study, they'll see excited, and, uh, and inspired students, and they'll see work that is engaging and successful, and, and that's really what the field is about is helping our clients and our programs and our organizations and systems in developmentally appropriate ways to, to be successful, and to forge their future in the most opportunistic way. So, again, it's not something programs should do, it is something they could do, but it's actually something they must do.
