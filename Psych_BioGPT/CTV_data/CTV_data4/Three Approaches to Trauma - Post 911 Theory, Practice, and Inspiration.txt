DERALD WING SUE  My name is Derald Wing Sue, Professor of Psychology and Education at Teachers College Columbia University. This video on Three Approaches to Trauma, was a collaboration between the producer, Dr. Allen Ivey of Microtraining Associates and two other colleagues, Dr. Thomas Parham and Lynn Banez. In the aftermath of the destruction of the World Trade Center in New York City and the attack upon the Pentagon in Washington D.C., our nation has been stunned and shocked by these horrific events. While psychologists have always studied traumatic stress in its many forms, the terrorists attack on September 11, 2001, referred to as 9/11, has forced us to view trauma and terrorism as continuing facts in everyday life. As counselors helping professionals, healers, and citizens, there have never been a more urgent time to understand the nature effects and means to deal with trauma. While the focus on this video is on the events of 9/11, you will find many of the general principles to be discussed during this tape to apply equally well to all forms of trauma. Today, three of us will share with you some of our thoughts and work on the multiple ways people deal and manage traumatic stress. In the first part of this video, I will speak to trauma, the manifestations and what has been found about coping. This will be followed by Dr. Thomas Parham's presentation on Alternative and Spiritual Healing in the time of trauma. Dr. Parham is an associate vice chancellor and Director of the Counseling Center at the University of California in Irvine. He is past president of the Association of Black Psychologists and the Association for Multicultural Counseling and Development. He has published widely on culture-specific methods of healing. Some of us who have watched Dr. Parham demonstrate healing principles refer to him as an Urban Shaman or an urban indigenous healer. Following Dr. ah, Parham will be Dr. Lynn Banez, who will speak to narratives of trauma and healing post 9/11, Voices of Healers and Healing. Dr. Banez is an assistant professor of Counselor Education at Fairfield University. She is lead author of Principles for Diversity Competent Group Workers and specializes in working with diverse populations in group and individual counseling. Her philosophy in work, in the need to work with the wo, is the need to work with the whole person, mind, body and spirit. In her presentation, you will watch her use of narratives and groups as a means to cope with traumatic stress and the issues that arise from terrorism. As an introduction to what we already know about trauma, let me briefly describe to you my story on that fateful 9/11 day. I was working in my office, in Teachers College, when a colleague of mine ran into my office to tell me, ah, that a plane had struck one of the towers at the World Trade Center. I turned on the radio immediately and listened to this in disbelief and did not know particularly what led up to this situation. My immediate thought was that it was accidental or some, uh, uhm, major event had occurred outside of our understanding and control. I ran back home immediately, since I live only a block from here, to watch this on ah, television when the second plane struck the tower. At this point ah, the commentators and many of us knew that this could not be accidental, which at this point left many of us ah, very concerned about our own safety and the meaning of these tragic ah, events. All New Yorkers were stunned, horrified, and confused during this period of time. We heard sirens and we could smell and see smoke emanating from now what is called "Ground Zero". Immediately following the disaster, people appeared as I've said before, disoriented and confused, and there were further apprehensions and fears, once we realized that this was not of an accidental nature. People everywhere wanted to offer help and many of them, uhm, ah, went down to ah, Ground Zero to volunteer giving blood. Sadly, ah, blood was not needed because there were few survivors from this ah, incident. The loss of 3,000 lives, originally we had thought that this was far higher, may be twice that amount, still seem incomprehensible to many of us. My, ah, at my university at ah, Teachers College in Columbia, what happened was that our classes were canceled and the, ah, college was closed at that particular point. Ah, when it did open, ah, what happened was that security was everywhere. We had to go in ah, and show our, uhm, ah, photo IDs, all bags were searched and so forth, and this has maintained to be the ah, norm even to this day nearly ah, one year later. These safeguards, like I've said, continue today and have made normality very difficult for many of us to reestablish again. Many of the reactions that I saw at that time dealt with fears of, of a life-threatening nature, grieving over the loss of ah, loved ones and concern about an, ah, the inability to find out ah, where our family, friends, and neighbors were at the time of this ah, event. There was also great mistrust at that, ah, ah, weeks later that dealt with anyone who appeared of middle-eastern, ah, features and this generalized ah, consequently to also ah, many Asians and Asian-Americans ah, became ah, suspect, ah, in terms of their ah, motives as well. Students in my classes found it very unable to concentrate on their work. The event ah, made study and the course content seemed inconsequential in ah, light of the enormity of the 9/11 of ah, incident. Ah, as I work in the Department of Counseling and Clinical Psychology, many of our student interns worked at field sites and, and in schools uhm, ah, counseling many of the ah, individuals there, and ah, generally, that doesn't need to be said, that many of the students and many of the clients uhm, were affected by the trauma and came to our interns for help. What became evident that day, however, was something that has ah, ah, that I hope, we will address ah, further in the tape, and that question dealt with, 'How does one heal when one has also been the victim of a traumatic event such as this?' Many of our interns, for example in our groups when we try to talk and process this, found it very difficult to work with their clients in light of the healing that they needed to undergo uhm, themselves. In light of 9/11, understanding trauma has gained even greater importance for mental health providers. Even more pressing, however, is the realization that terrorism is a national concern and the trauma experienced that morning was not only we, uhm, ah, not only concentrated to people in New York or to Washington D.C., but to the entire nation who watched and heard about this ah, terrible tragedy and event. What constitutes a trauma? What happens to people after a traumatic event? How do we as counselors and healers help those suffering from a trauma? Equally important, how do we take care of ourselves in light of this ah, event? 9/11 definitely qualifies as a distressing, traumatic event that occurs outside the realm of normal human experience. This is a definition that we, in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders used to describe extreme stressors like earthquakes, war, violent crime, rape, abuse, natural disasters, and in this case, terrorism. We must not, however, as I'm about to talk about some of the symptoms that deal with ah, ah, our being able to understand a trauma and especially ah, a terrorism, must not confuse normal stress reactions with the abnormal ones that often occur as the extremes ones that often occur as a result of this. But as a psychologist who works in the field of Abnormal Psychology, we know that there are two forms of stress disorders that occur. One of them, we call acute stress disorder (ASD), and the other one, posttraumatic stress disorder which is PTSD. Both require an exposure to extreme stressors or to a number of additive ones that create a disequilibrium in people's lives. Ah, acute stress disorders generally last for more than two weeks, but tend to disappear after about a month or 30 days. Posttraumatic stress disorders can last for 30 ah, over 30 days and ah, ah, at times can go for months and even years. What are some of the symptoms that we as mental health providers need to be aware of in working with our troubled clients ah, or ah, friends and neighbors and even ourselves? Some of the signs that we are under ah, ah, traumatic stress tend to be deal with sleeping habits. Many people have problems falling asleep and some have problems staying asleep. Generally, people who ah, experienced a traumatic stress will undergo feelings ah, occasionally, of numbness, detachment, or emotional distance from others. There are many explanations about why these ah, ah, may occur. One of them is the stimulation from the trauma is so great that the mind begins to shut down to protect us and to allow us time to process the traumatic event and to make meaning and sense of this. Many people when they undergo extreme trauma have a lack desire for physical or sexual ah, ah, contact or an increased in, in the desire for physical and sexual contact. One of the things that was, has been written up in New York was that directly after this trauma ah, there was an increase in pregnancies due to sexual ah, activity and this, ah, oftentimes, is seen as one of the ah, ah, evidences of the symptoms of trauma that occurred. Oftentimes, there is what we call, recurring or intrusive recollections of the traumatic event. Ah, again, people may have nightmares, dreams or continual thoughts about seeing those planes strike the buildings and seeing the towers collapse. And this is almost replayed over and over like we saw ah, in on, on TV ah, ah, programs. Again, this intrusive recurring thought ah, some ah, trauma experts ah, tend to believe that it is an attempt by many of us to desensitize by replaying things ah, ah, over and over or by allowing some degree of sense and mastery or control and to give, attribute meaning. Ah, there may be a desire to abandon everything, to run away from the ah, responsibilities of, of life. People, oftentimes, have difficulty concentrating and, and completing tasks. Memory tends to fail. In my classes, many of my students had great difficulty concentrating of on the book learning that was required of them, and we, oftentimes, had to constantly talk about this throughout our classes in order to process of ah, these feelings. There is oftentimes an exaggerated, what we call, startle response. For example, uhm, uhm, as a result of this, ah, there were times in which it is not unusual ah, in Manhattan, where I live, to hear fire sirens or police sirens going all the time. Anytime, I used to hear this and not be bothered by it, but after 9/11, when I heard a siren go off, I would be jumpy and skittish in, in some sense. This is ah, evidence of a traumatic ah, experience and a startle response that many of us have. Others, because of the traumatic stress, may express themselves in terms of somatic ah, symptoms such as headaches, diarrhea, upset stomach. Some people become more susceptible to illnesses like colds, and, and the flu. Ah, stress does affect the immune system here. There are many other symptoms that uhm, are associated with traumatic stress. In the case of, of some individuals, I saw extreme depression occurring. Ah, weeping ah, occurred. Grieving, ah, in the sense of a loss of loved ones. Ah, one of the greatest uhm, difficulties that I had was to find out whether my friends were safe or not. In fact, directly after this event, it even extended to my son and daughter, and once I was able to call and talk to them to tell them that we were okay, and that they were okay, I felt guilt because I felt relieved and watching many of my friends still being unable to cope with finding out what had happened to their loved ones or, or friends at this nature. What we are at this time beginning to see is that the few individuals who survived are also decoping with what we call, survivor guilt, that is that, "Why did I survive and others not in light of this? So that these are all feelings that tend to, uh, deal with it. How do people cope with trauma? Well, first of all, I want to say that there is no one way to do it. There are many ways to cope and it depends uhm, primarily on a number of individual differences, a cultural factors, group differences that occur. Coping occurs, we know, along a number of different dimensions. It can occur effectively, our emotions, how do we deal with our emotions and used them, cognitively, ah, behaviorally and spiritually? For example, uhm, ah, in, in terms of emotions, many of us need to, ah, ah, to in some sense, acknowledge the fears, the anxieties, the guilt, the feeling that we have. Others, in terms of cognitively, have to find meaning. Does this event make sense? Why did it happen? Making meaning is one of the things that human beings need to be able to do in light of a disequilibrium and confusion that uhm, ah, occurs here. Behaviorally, some people cope by needing to do things. Doers were going down, like I was saying, to give, ah, blankets to volunteer services and one of the things that, ah, strangely enough, was that, I mentioned earlier that many people volunteered to give blood, but blood was not needed. So, they were turned away. There was a call for mental health professionals to come and worked with those uhm, ah, workers ah, who rescue workers who were experiencing also trauma and stress. Many mental health ah, professionals when they went down to Ground Zero to offer help were turned away because they were requiring or wanting only licensed professionals to give help because of legal liability issues. These individuals suffered because they wanted to do something, and yet were unable to offer ah, ah, their services. Another means of coping is spiritually. And again, uhm, in, in some sense, ah, what we saw was that many people turned to a greater force uhm, in terms of understanding the situations that occurred. Many of us attended prayer vigils uhm, ah, to think about, spiritually, of the meaning of these events in our, our lives. Some people deal with trauma ah, differently. For example, uhm, introverts tend to process the events internally not necessarily talking to other uhm, ah, individuals. People who we might call extroverts tend to talk to others to need to constantly processes's in an external ah, way. It is also important to know that ah, nested, embedded feelings need to be dealt with, but some people differ as to when it is best for them to deal with these uhm, ah, feelings. Some people process feelings immediately. I tend to process my feelings much later and my wife and I differ in this, but it is very important that we rely on the readiness of people to deal uhm, with the feelings. How can we as healers psychologically deal with our own healing before we give ah, aid and comfort to others? There are many personal ways uhm, of dealing with healing. First of all, because we're disoriented and everything appears uhm, ah, meaningless, in light of a huge trauma like this, is important for people to share their experience, to tell their stories ah, to one another. People, some people do this by talking. I recall riding in my apartment going up the elevator, strangers that I didn't know, who would begin a conversation with me to talk about uhm, what they saw happen, uhm, the relationship and I would ah, begin to talk to them ah, as well about this, but talking to strangers, friends, uhm, ah, loved ones becomes all important. It's almost a feeling that you're not alone. You're ah, you're able to share these uhm, ah, thoughts, experiences and their feelings with others. Some people don't talk about it. In this case, some people write and that is really ah, a very legitimate way to deal with, whether you keep a diary, whether ah, you write. I wrote ah, a, an article on the aftermath of 9/11 on the Internet to share my uhm, ah, feelings with people. But many people wrote ah, and that is one way ah, that may be characteristic or how they do it. Children uhm, tend not to be able perhaps to ah, verbally articulate their fears and, and concerns. And in this case, the medium of communication for them might be drawing, might be playing. These are all methods that vary uhm, in terms of this. Another means that some people might find in coping uhm, individually is to increase their physical activities. Now, many of you know that I'm, ah, an exercise, I'm addicted to exercise. I exercise and run three miles every uhm, ah, other day. I found after this that the amount of running that I had went up to five miles a day and still has not uhm, ah, dissipated at this point. But many of us tend to feel better if we're able to exercise in one form ah, or another. The other thing is to keep in contact with family, friends, co-workers. Talk to one another. Share with one another. This interconnectedness with other people is one of the uhm, strongest immunizing forces ah, against uhm, stress that we can have. Ah, focus on helping others if you can. Now, helping does not have to be formal, in which a client comes into your office, you can help, help others by ah, talking to them on a bus, by sharing on subways, any, it doesn't have to be formal. Uhm, ah, in terms of this, some of you are better at practicing things like relaxation, meditation, or prayer activities, of getting in contact with religious types of, of services might be helpful. Lastly, even as a healer, some of us require professional help when things get too bad and we should, uhm, as healers as ourselves be amenable to seeking help when a thing, ah, when we are stuck and need to, in some sense, begin to move in, in this way. Now, uhm, one of the aspects of ah, dealing with trauma and stress is our ah, ability to regain a sense of control. Ah, we don't need to know practical things that we can do to prepare ah, against the effects of stress and trauma. We have to, for example, this is a very common thing, we have to know emergency routes, location of services, ask for advice from ah, experts. We need to know and to, ah, what to do in times of stress or in times of trauma. That's why we have fire drills. That's why when we get on planes, the flight attendants tell us where the exits are and so forth. It is very important that we are prepared to deal with these uhm, ah, situations. We should, in some sense, try to resume all our normal activities as quickly as possible. This does not mean, however, that we deny the trauma or our reactions and feelings of ah, dealing with it. We have to play ah, careful attention to our own physical well being. Some of these are very commonsensical. We have to drink plenty of liquids. Eat nutritionally. Get plenty of rests and increase, what I call, self-nurturing ah, ah, activities. We should follow a program of exercise and keep this process going for as long as needed in order to ah, be strong for us to be able to help others. Now, how do we administer, what I call psychological first aid to individuals who have experienced trauma. One of them is that we need to calm people who have experienced trauma to relieve their anxiety allowing them to communicate. We have to be confident in our ability to work with them. It is not phoniness, however, but it's a situation in which we need to understand how we can best help uhm, ah, individuals. We have to, as a result, uhm, you know, accept our personal limitations about how much help that we can give to others. We have to encourage the person to speak freely about whatever is on their mind and to be patient about this. Practice active listening becomes very important in our work with uhm, ah, individual clients. We should not argue with them. Ah, it is very important, for example, indeed if they have fears, arguing with them to tell them that their fears are unsubstantiated, is not accepting where they are at and the legitimacy or validation of, of their feelings. And like I was saying, all of us need to accept our role ah, and limitations uhm, as a relief helper in some way. Now, I would like to just uhm, ah, close ah, this presentation and move to the others ah, by saying ah, in summary, some of the things that I think we need to keep in mind. Ah, healing occurs in many forms. The healer, such as you and I, must attend to our own well being as well. Otherwise, we are not helpful to those that we wish to serve. We have to realize that healing can occur in many forms. It is just not a formal, ah, in-the-office, therapy counseling session. Healing can occur in the playgrounds, ah, at, at work, uhm, ah, in public transportation, in, in ah, other buildings. Healing can occur as long as you are you are authentic in expressing your ah, ah, feelings and thoughts and allowing people to share with you what is going on with them as we, well. Another thing that we will see in the forthcoming ah, two segments of the video, is that narratives and storytelling are powerful means of dealing with trauma. We have to allow people to tell their stories, to make meaning out of what their stories are because it is a means of connection to one another. And lastly, what I would like to say, is that spirituality is intimately important for the healing process to occur. Ah, it is indeed something that talks, speaks to the interconnectedness of the human condition. We, we feel we are together, not alone, and not separated. And lastly, what we are beginning to realize is that social support and reassurance are time-tested methods of managing stress. Ah, we know, for example, that suicide rates are lower in people who are married than people who are single or recently ah, divorced. We know that for some reason, when we function as a collective, as a group, we are more immunized against trauma and stress. And now, I would like to turn the next segment ah, ah, to Dr. Thomas Parham, and following Dr. Parham, Dr. Lynn Banez. Thank you.

Spirituality, Ritual, and Reflection as Responses to Trauma Thomas Parham, Ph.D. 

00:28:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Hello, I'm Dr. Thomas Parham. I'm the Assistant Vice Chancellor for Counseling and Health Services and Director of the Counseling Center at the University of California, Irvine and former President of the National Association of Black Psychologists. 

00:28:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  In our capacity as mental health professionals, we are challenged to help a nation cope with the numerous tragedies and traumas that are impacting our lives and we bring to bear a set of therapeutic skills and resources that are designed to facilitate healing in the clients we serve. In my professional life I've been blessed, to coin a phrase that I've used a lot. This says, "Healing can be therapeutic, but not all therapy is healing." In this regard, I mean to suggest that traditional interventions, we as psychologists often employ may not be the most facilitative intervention in a particular context as we think about coping with trauma, tragedy, and pain that are impacting the lives of our clients and even ourselves. It demands that we consider other treatment modalities. In this segment of Three Approaches to Trauma, I seek to access the spiritual dimension of clients in a group setting by helping them not only to focus on the notion of prayer, but also to remember, to reflect, and to try to give voice to those passions, those pains, those places in their spirit that need to be heard. 

00:30:00
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D.  Good day. We come to this place in parks and communities, in schools and churches across this country, in mental health centers and in hospitals, in counties blessed with extreme affluence, in cities stricken with extreme poverty, to pray and to reflect. We pray for our fellowmen, countrymen, and women whose lives had been cut short by extreme examples of peoples and humanity toward others. We offer prayer for those professionals who have risked their lives while trying to assist in the rescue efforts. We offer prayer for all the families whose hearts ache with grief and pain that death burns. And we pray that the Creator will visit that empty place inside their hearts where tears are born, and give them comfort and a rock to cling to, and a stone this tragedy has brought. We gather this day not simply to denounce terrorism or violence that contaminates our world but to mourn the loss of life and loss of innocence that our nation is suffering. We assemble at this time not merely as individuals from different divisions of an institution or different statuses in our community, or even different, different demographic characteristics of racing class and religious face and gender and physical ability, but we assemble as a single community. We are a community united by common bonds of sadness connected by profound sense of confusion. We are linked by appointed tones(ph) of anger and outrage enjoined by a desire to offer comfort and support to those who have experienced loss first hand. But despite the fact that we have been humbled by apparent exposure and vulnerability as a community and a nation, as a people, we are nonetheless heartened by the countless acts of courage, inspired by the spirit of help and volunteers that has swept our cities, and we are determined in our resolve to never ever allow misery to have the last word. And so, we come to this place to seek questions, to seek answers. Standing here in the shadows of this tragedy test of faith of each of us today, and enforces us to confront the question of What do we really believe? Do we believe in the Creator's mercy? Do we trust that the Creator has prepared a place for those whose lives ended too soon? Do we believe in the ideas of freedom and equality and justice for all? If we have no faith then our sorrow's great indeed. If we have no faith then the pain we feel becomes more piercing and penetrating for it signifies that the physical remains of the victims all that is left. And in the aftermath of the tragedy is the testimony to the triumph of terrorism and violence that has hit our community. But if we believe in what we profess that the Creator in heaven, whatever we call him or her, is the ultimate good. If we believe in what we profess that there is a spirit of peace at the end of life's journey. If we believe in what we profess that America's one of the greatest nations on earth and the Star Spangled Banner still waves amid the treachery and tyranny of terrorism, then our pain, our anger, our grief must be mixed with the recognition that God the Creator will reward our fallen brethren(ph), and this nation will rise up and ascend to its rightful place of rulership and mastery over the ideas of freedom and democracy. 

00:34:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D.  Reflecting on this tragedy also challenges us and it challenges us to make some difficult choices. Quite naturally, an attack on our freedom provokes a reaction that is understandably defensive and filled with the aggressiveness of reciprocal hostility. And yet, I pray today that our pain will not plunge us into the depths of despair while behaviors and attitudes begin to mere those of people whose acts we find so despicable. That is not the American way. It is not our cultural truth and that certainly is not our true self for in the minutes, hours, and the days that follow tragedy in our life, I like you, witness our true self. That self that finally built the persevere in the face of adversity. That self that showed hope in the face of despair. That self that showed courage in the face of fear. That self that found compassion in the face of insensitivity. And so we must decide if we choose love over hate, civility over disrespect, measure defensiveness over reckless retribution, and embracing humanity over inhumanness. We must decide to that and choose. 

00:36:10
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D.  In recapturing these thoughts, I'm reminded as I speak to you today of other tragedies in our distant past which have shaken individuals and communities across this nation in similar ways. The bomb blast in the church in Birmingham, Alabama that took the lives of four little girls. The riding murder in burning of homes of witnesses in Black Wall Street section of Tulsa, Oklahoma in the 1920s that took hundreds and maybe thousands of lives. The murder of Emmett Till, or the Freedom Riders Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney in the 1960s. The assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The beating of Rodney King, or the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, or maybe the brutality reaped on a Haitian immigrant who was assaulted by New York police. Each of these incidents and countless others too numerous to name struck at the very core of our nation's soul. Each of these tragedies singes the fabric of our decency. As people personally and collectively affected by events, we struggle to hold back our justified anger and rage. And yet, despite the volatility of our spirits at each of those phase in time, people were advised to wait on justice. Despite our instinct to retaliate, people were advised to exercise patience. Despite the impulse to strike back with reciprocal vengeance, people were advised and police get to show a restraint. Why? Because America is a land where justice is a practice we usually insist on and not a principle that can be tucked the way because it runs contrary to our blind thirst for retaliation. Well, if patience was good enough for the people in Oklahoma, can it be any less beneficial for American now? If constraint was good enough for the African descent people in Birmingham, can it be any less appropriate for our nation now? If winning on justice and trust in the Creator was good enough for people in agony and grief over assassinations and murders and brutality that has swept this nation in years passed, can it be any less comforting for America in this hour of pain? America, my friends, has never been a land that preached retaliation. We have never been a society that advocates discarding systems of justice in favor of vigilantism. And we could never be the moral leaders we pride ourselves on being if we only seek to strike back at those who perpetuate these evil acts of terrorism and violence without regard for the lands we may destroy or the innocent people we may hurt in the process. 

00:39:30
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D.  I'm not advocating in engaging in the process of denial or even acting as if we somehow need to tolerate assaults on our safety and security as a people on a mission(ph). No. I only hope and implore our leaders to think critically about making a full range of exploration around available lapses and choices, and not proceed with a warlike mentality that shows no regard for the consequences of our actions. That may come back to haunt us and other civilized societies as well, for decades to come. We must think carefully through this and I pray that we do that today. 

00:40:15
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. And so we close today with a message with a strength and resolve to not allow my pain and your pain to be blunted by the hardened planks of denial. We will not allow that today. There's nothing normal about what we had witnessed and acting as if we can go about business as usual without pause for prayer and reflection is a lie. And so, I choose to allow my maleness to cry. My African-American and that's to transcend racial and ethnic boundaries, my anger to be redirected into more constructive pursuits, and my Christian ideals to transcend boundaries that keep me disconnected from brothers and sisters in other faiths. 

00:41:05
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D.  I choose to believe in ideas of democracy. I choose to believe that freedom is never secure without struggle. I choose to believe that the sickness of terrorism and violence that dampens our door will ultimately be defeated not simply with military coalitions or technologies and sophisticated defense systems. But rather I believe that we will also need the health and wholesomeness of our tolerance, the empathic(ph) understanding of how our foreign policy creates a world where people despise us so, our resolve to address whatever wrongs of perceived injustices we have committed in our communities or other places around the world, as well as the respect for diversity and diverse ideas, what we learned to peacefully coexist in a world where the majority is not white, American, Christian or wealthy. And I choose to believe in a world where peace and stability can reign and we can learn to disagree without being violently disagreeable. 

00:42:10
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D.  I ask you to join me in prayer now. We pray that the Creator will hear our cries, will relieve our suffering and pain, and will touch our hearts. We pray that the Creator will heal our spirits, will bestow on us the strength to resist evil wherever it may be and never ever allow misery to have the last word. I ask you to join me in praying today that the leaders in our nation and our community will be blessed with the wisdom to make tough yet responsible choices, that our fellow citizens will learn to resist a temptation to stereotype people by color and ethnicity and religious affiliation and that allowed to be restored with the calmness and stability we have come to take for granted. I pray that today. I ask you to join me in praying that we who occupy the adult quarters(ph) of the world will honor the sacrifice of those who have been lost by maximizing that the (inaudible ) of pain what we profess and how we believe. I pray that our children will be able to take ownership of a world where they enjoy a greater level of safety and security than we have experienced. And I pray that the Creator will allow us to cry when we hurt, to smile when we succeed, and despite the tragedy that has hit our life recognize and appreciate all the ways in which we have been profoundly blessed in our lives. Thank you. 

00:43:50
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D.  Thank you for being with us today. As you think about having been touched by tragedy, trauma, pain in your life, there's a tendency to want to access some kind of healing space. I wonder how the presentation today might've helped you do that. 

00:44:10
  Well, a presentation like this helps me whenever I go through with these, like in two ways. First of all, it helps me this, you come together in a place where there are other people that may be experiencing the same thing that you're going through, and that gives you a sense of comfort, you know, you're not going through things by yourself. And secondly, there are oftentimes where something will happen and you don't really have, you just have a bunch of bit of frustration, you have feelings inside. You know, we have the words will express what you're trying to say even to yourself. And whenever you come up (inaudible )of, on a point of speaking to you sometimes, they can give, they put the words out there for you. They give you the words to say like what you're trying to say about what, what, express what you're going through. 

00:44:55
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. So, it sounds like we have two issues. One is the notion of universality where it allows you to feel like I'm not in this alone and I'm in this with some other people. 

00:45:00
 Yeah. 

00:45:00
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D.  And the second is that mental health providers are able to give voice to the feelings and other insights that you have inside, but are sometimes unable to express in words. 

00:45:15
 Yeah, exactly. 

00:45:20
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Okay. 

00:45:20
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. I wonder if you think back to a time when you've experienced some traumas and tragedies and pain in your life and have sought some kind of a healing space. How this presentation today was able to help you get there? 

00:45:35
 Well, uhm, when I think of personal tragedies, for me, I feel, I feel better when I'm around those who are going through the same thing as me. So, sitting in a space with other people, you get to hear what other people feel about the same thing and you, you also get the sense that there are other people going through the same thing. And so, I mean you can get something out of what somebody else say, somebody else says about that certain situation rather than just sitting with you and one other person in a room, of course, you're telling somebody what you're going through but that person might not necessarily feel what you're feeling. They're just get, uhm, more of a spiritual, uhm, more of a spiritual healing from a group of people being together listening and, and going back and forth. 

00:46:20
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D.  Okay. As you think about that spiritual healing that you're talking about, how was that different here listening to a psychologist, kind of preach and make social commentary if you will versus an individual ah, session where you might be sitting alone one on one with a psychologist or therapist? 

00:46:45
 Uhm, I think it's interesting and I think it's good, uhm, because the, a mental health professional has that training, you know, they have the background, but then I also think there should be a link between mental, spiritual, and physicals. You know what I mean? So I think it was, it's kind of a refreshing to hear a mental health professional go to, to the spiritual side because you have that link there. 

00:47:10
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Okay. And there's some people who'd be watching the tape who will find it strange to see a mental health professional kind of preaching and praying as opposed to minister, preacher, priest. Your reactions to that. 

00:47:25
 Once again, I think it's a good thing. Uhm, uhm, it will be interesting for some people to see that because they think there should be a separation there. Well, once again, I think it's a good thing to hear a mental health professional go to the spiritual side because I feel there's a link between how you, how you're doing mentally and how you're doing spiritually. 

00:47:45
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Were there particular aspects of yourself that this presentation was able to touch today? 

00:47:50
  Yes, uhm, because I've had personal tragedies lately and so, uhm, it's, even though I wasn't too, very attached to this September 11th tragedy, uhm, the loss of life is still the same. And then there's, even though you've gone through it many, many times and it might be bigger on some scales, it's gonna be different each time because it's a different person and just uhm, just listening to the spiritual reflection and, uhm, I've gained something from the words. It gave me something to think about and I do know it's gonna get better and just, I'm focusing on what was said, you know, helps me at a lot. 

00:48:30
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. So, the message that was delivered today touches you in places than not only reflect on the national tragedy that sounds like some individual personal tragedies in your life. 

00:48:40
 Uh hmm. Yes. 

00:48:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Okay. Thank you very much. 

00:48:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D.  There are folk who, from time to time have had tragedy, pain, trauma in their life. And as you or others have sought that healing space, I'm wondering how this presentation you've just experienced has allowed you to be able to access that. 

00:49:00
 Well, I feel one of the key aspects to healing uhm, and dealing with human individuals is hope. And, uhm, individuals that lack that aspect of life, it's hard for them to develop the healing process. So, the main thing that I received from a setting like this was the hope that there's other individuals out there with similar feelings striving towards making this world a better place to live in. So, just, you know, then since that you have that support and hope that this world could possibly change and be a better place. 

00:49:35
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Okay. So, the message that gives an instillation of hope combined with a prayer sounds like it's a real facilitator. 

00:49:40
 It definitely is. 

00:49:40
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D.  Okay. There are some people who will find it strange to see a mental health professional engaged in a role of kind of a preacher as opposed to a standard preacher, minister, priest, you know, who's in that space who also combines kind of a healing message with some of the social commentary. I wonder if you could share with us your reactions to that presentation today. 

00:50:05
 Uhm, personally, I like the different arena, different set. Uhm, I think a lot of individuals have a certain mindset when they do attend church or they are in front of a priest or pastor. And having someone who's not necessarily associated with a religion speaking about ways that we could change society and social change, I just think that helps benefit individuals on a whole. You don't really have those bias if you do have any like I'm in a religious setting, I'm in a church. And I think it just cause individuals to be more, uhm, real with their responses and how they could go about change in society. It's just another individual out there that is uhm, speaking about his opinion on how a certain situation played out and both individuals are going back and forth. You're receiving, and in turn, receiving something to that individual. So, I like just a change of the difference in environment, the difference in a person who's in almost the same material. 

00:51:05
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D.  As you think about the presentation today, are there particular aspects of your personality, your thoughts, your feelings, your behaviors, your spirit uhm, that were touched today about what you heard? 

00:51:20
 I believe you mentioned one thing about waiting and being patient. And that kinda stuck out because I think too long society has waited and being patient and when an event like this occurs, chaos is the first reaction of everyone in the society. And I think it's time that we have more venues like this so we can express our feelings and be a little bit more proactive and not wait. That's what uhm, society expects individuals to do is wait and be patient, and it kinda take the blows as they come. I don't think that uhm, adheres to proper development. This causes everyone to be all over the place with these fragments of it. 

00:52:05
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. So it sounds like if, if I'm paraphrasing right, the presentation today allows you intellectually to think about the notion of patience and contrasted with the chaotic nature of, of people's reactions to trauma. But also that the presentation helps to kind of quiet your spirit in a way that allows you to, uhm, really bond with the message that's been given that says I need to be maybe in a different emotional space than I am now. 

00:52:35
 Definitely. You have to put your place, you have to put yourself at a place where you're presented with a question, a situation, an issue, and where's your position in it. Were you one of those, I don't wanna say passive individuals or were you one of those individuals that were a little bit more active. And then at this point, wherever you are in the area, where you're gonna be in the next couple of days, and are you gonna progress forward to be a little bit more proactive and not to sit and wait. So the, the, it causes you to, uhm, form an opinion and then take action after that. 

00:53:10
THOMAS PARHAM, PH.D. Okay, all right. Thank you for sharing.

Narratives of Trauma and Healing Post 9/11: Voices of Healers and the Healing. Lynn Banez, PH.D. PARTICIPANTS Ali Taeb Louise Lague Anne Manton Veronica Quinn Lorraine Duffy 

00:53:15
LYNN BANEZ  Hello and welcome. My name is Dr. Lynn Banez, and this is three approaches or Three Responses to Trauma. In this video, we're gonna focus on the stories of the people who had been impacted by September 11th and the aftermath, and how we respond as mental health professionals, counselors, social workers, psychologists to that kind of trauma. 

00:53:50
An Iranian-American's Experience of 9/11 

00:53:50
LYNN BANEZ  Ali is here to speak on behalf of Arab-Americans, Muslim-Americans, his own personal story. Ah, and, Ali, let me ask you, uhm, how has your life been the same, changed, or different ah, the moment that September 11th happened, the moment that you heard about that? What, what crossed your mind? 

00:54:30
ALI TAEB Well, of course, it has not been the same and, from my job, to school, to, (crosstalk) 

00:54:40
LYNN BANEZ  And from your job to school? 

00:54:45
ALI TAEB to everything, it has not been the same. 

00:54:45
LYNN BANEZ  Uh hmm. Can, can you articulate that a little bit, ah, more and, and really speak to the people out there... (crosstalk) 

00:54:55
ALI TAEB Sure. 

00:54:55
LYNN BANEZ ...and, and let them know ah, what, what your experience has been? 

00:55:00
ALI TAEB Uhm, sure. When uhm, the incident happened on September 11th, (crosstalk) 

00:55:05
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

00:55:05
ALI TAEB  uhm, the first thing I wanted to do being so close to New York City, in Fairfield, (crosstalk) 

00:55:15
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

00:55:15
ALI TAEB I wanted to go down and extend my help, extend my, since I have a Master's in Marriage and Family Therapy, (crosstalk) 

00:55:25
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

00:55:25
ALI TAEB I thought I could go down to the city and help out. But, uhm, when I actually was gonna go down to help out a lot of people, many people in the community told me not to just only because I was a Muslim and from Iran, 

00:55:40
LYNN BANEZ  Uh hmm. 

00:55:45
ALI TAEB which I moved here with my mom and dad at the age of 12. (crosstalk) 

00:55:45
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

00:55:45
ALI TAEB So, uhm, I just couldn't do anything. I, I had. (crosstalk) 

00:55:50
LYNN BANEZ  What, what, what did it feel like to feel frozen in that, in that moment, wanting to help, here you are trained marriage and family therapist, here's obvious people in need. 

00:56:05
ALI TAEB It makes you sad. It makes you sad. It makes you disappointed, very much so. 

00:56:15
LYNN BANEZ Sad. Disappointed. Ah, when you and I were ah, speaking earlier, ah, you had said that there were pieces of that, that took you back actually to your experience in Iran. 

00:56:30
ALI TAEB Correct. I was about 12 years old when I moved here with my mom... (crosstalk) 

00:56:35
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

00:56:35
ALI TAEB ...and dad to this country. And, uhm, when I was watching the World Trade Center being bombed, actually the first plane when it hit, I was watching CNBC and, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:56:50
LYNN BANEZ So you saw it. 

00:56:50
ALI TAEB Right. And I thought it was an accident. But then I saw the second plane hit, when they said this is definitely not an accident. And I saw all those people trapped on, on top of the World Trade Center, I got, I got taken back to what was, what happened in Iran when I was 12 years old, during the time that the war was going on. And, uhm, and my, my first reaction was to get on the train and go down to the city just to help out. (crosstalk) 

00:57:20
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

00:57:20
ALI TAEB  That was my first reaction. So, I called a few of my friends, professors, but they all advised me not to just because of what was going on... (crosstalk) 

00:57:30
LYNN BANEZ  Uh hmm. 

00:57:35
ALI TAEB ...since Muslims or Arab-Americans or Muslims did that, it's gonna be looked down upon and if I go down there, I, I might actually... (crosstalk) 

00:57:45
LYNN BANEZ Hmm. 

00:57:45
ALI TAEB ...be jeopardizing my own life, (crosstalk) 

00:57:50
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

00:57:50
ALI TAEB so, (crosstalk) 

00:57:50
LYNN BANEZ So, in those early moments you had really several, you, you were responding to several stories, stories that were older that came back to you and said I'm, I'm helpless... (crosstalk) 

00:58:05
ALI TAEB Of course. 

00:58:05
LYNN BANEZ ...and I wanna help. And then more current with the... (crosstalk) 

00:58:10
ALI TAEB (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:58:13
LYNN BANEZ ...same message, "I'm trained, I wanna help, I have something to offer, and yet I'm helpless, I'm being told I can't," (crosstalk) 

00:58:20
ALI TAEB Right. 

00:58:20
LYNN BANEZ and you said that that hurt you. Did you feel mad or did you feel at all angry or afraid? 

00:58:30
ALI TAEB Not really. I couldn't be mad. I understood. It was not that it was justifiable, but I understood. I understood how, how people would look, how people during the first few hours of that incident would feel... (crosstalk) 

00:58:50
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

00:58:50
ALI TAEB  toward everybody in that religion... (crosstalk) 

00:58:55
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

00:58:55
ALI TAEB ...or everybody from those type of countries. (crosstalk) 

00:59:00
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

00:59:00
ALI TAEB And uhm, although I consider myself American now, but you still have that, that sense that people might look at you different still just because you came... (crosstalk) 

00:59:10
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

00:59:10
ALI TAEB ...from that country or because you're a Muslim, because of your religion, because of your background, because of maybe what you look like. (crosstalk) 

00:59:20
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

00:59:20
ALI TAEB So, it was tough. 

00:59:25
LYNN BANEZ So, there is an aspect of, of you that (inaudible ) still is unable ah, to move more freely. 

00:59:35
ALI TAEB Oh, of course. Oh, definitely, no doubt. Uhm, I try not to fly. I try to avoid airports, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:59:45
LYNN BANEZ What's your fear? 

00:59:50
Stop Tape: What occurs for you when you encounter a Muslim-American? What is your experience of this video segment? What is the counselor's responsibility in trauma? 

00:59:50
ALI TAEB The clients that come to me range from African-American, ah, bisexuals, gays, ah, you name it. Hispanic. I know myself that in the back of my mind I have no, absolutely no, basically, I, I have a clean slate and that's how I look at all kinds of people. (crosstalk) 

01:00:30
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:00:30
ALI TAEB  That's how I, I know I could best help them. (crosstalk) 

01:00:35
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm, hmm. 

01:00:35
ALI TAEB So, I do hope that the September 11th, my fear is that the September 11th incident had an impact on our society so much that I'm afraid, like when I was, about 14, 15 years old during the Persian Gulf war, I was, I was still in high school. (crosstalk) 

01:01:00
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:01:00
ALI TAEB I'm afraid that it's gonna happen the same way during high school years that, it's gonna happen the same way at this time, when September 11 happened. People are gonna have a different set of mind about Muslim- Americans and Middle Eastern Americans, and that's why our kid's not gonna get the help they need and our family's not gonna get the help they need. And it's just gonna be a big cycle. That's my fear. So, (crosstalk) 

01:01:30
LYNN BANEZ  Uh hmm. So, you can see where it can go back again... (crosstalk) 

01:01:40
ALI TAEB Sure. (crosstalk) 

01:01:40
LYNN BANEZ ...and, and, and start and here you have children and families and individuals of all ages, (crosstalk) 

01:01:45
ALI TAEB Sure. 

01:01:45
LYNN BANEZ  reaching out and not having the help they need, because the (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

01:01:54
ALI TAEB Not that, not that our therapist's are not gonna help them. But, I am afraid that something deep down is not letting them to extend their helping hand, the complete helping hand. Like myself, when I was in, uhm, 11th grade, when the Persian Gulf war was happening in the Middle East, I saw it. I saw from my prof, from my teachers, from my professors, from my friends, from my uhm, counselors. I saw it. They wanted to help. But it was a different way. They, I, I could see. I could feel that it was different. (crosstalk) 

01:02:35
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:02:35
ALI TAEB Mr. Jones was not the same Mr. Jones I knew before the Persian Gulf war. 

01:02:40
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. Do, do you mind if I share a story about your coming to class, not coming to class? 

01:02:50
ALI TAEB Oh yeah, sure. Definitely. 

01:02:50
LYNN BANEZ Ah, because I think this might be a, a good summation of what it was that you're just talking about. Uhm, I had asked Ali to come to my ah, multicultural class to talk about Arab and Muslim American people and what he might share about their culture, so they might be better ah, counselors or mental, ah, other mental health professionals ah, working with that population. And he came to me and he said, "I'm afraid. (inaudible ) Dr. Banez, I'm afraid to come to your class today." And we talked about it. I said, you know, "I don't want you to do anything that you didn't wanna do." And so he, you know, he didn't come, and I went to class and I had nearly 30 students in my class, waiting for this guest speaker, and, you know, I kind of built it up as we were having a guest speaker still. And when it came time to turn it over to the guest speaker, I said, "We have none. He's not coming. He's not coming because he is afraid of you." And it stopped them. There was dead silence in my classroom. "What do you mean he's afraid of us?" "He's afraid. What if he offends you, and then you report him. And then he's detained. And then he's in jail for how long. He's legitimately afraid." And we had a very fascinating dialogue. And we talked about how, now Arab-looking or Muslim-looking Americans are being asked to step off of airplanes ah, to this very day. And, you know, so the trauma continues. We are continuing to respond to the trauma. And I said, "Okay. Let's pretend. You ask these people to step off your airplane. And they get off the airplane. They're, they're in, in emotional need now. They walk around the corner. They see your office. They go in and they want counseling from you? You just asked them to get off the plane. I don't know. I, (crosstalk) 

01:05:05
ALI TAEB That's exactly correct. 

01:05:05
LYNN BANEZ I think that's, that's the best way to, to end this segment, is you really have to take a look inside. How're we gonna come together as a community. As a community of diverse individuals in a mental health profession, to begin to heal one another, ourselves, as we do this kind of work and our communities. 

01:05:30
ALI TAEB The most important is that how could you as a therapist help people of all races. 

01:05:35
STOP TAPE What is the counselor's responsibility in trauma? What is your role in social justice and advocacy beyond the individual interview? Personal Experience and 9/11 

01:05:35
LYNN BANEZ Okay. Louise, as we're gathering stories about, uhm, not just 9/11, but certainly that is part of the stories that we're gathering, uhm, but looking then at a broader picture of how we respond to trauma uhm, of that magnitude in our nation. Ah, you had a, a, a unique story I thought to tell and I was wondering if you could go ahead and share that. 

01:06:15
LOUISE LAGUE I heard the news about 9/11 on a ship in the Aegean. Uhm, there are 150 people about half Americans and the news leaked over by cell phones, and then very slowly, the Captain made an announcement. We were not allowed to see the tapes. I saw the tapes in a little news store in, in Mykonos about four days later. A store that was packed with people trying to get newspapers and they kept running out of them. Uhm, coming back to the United States, I felt like somebody who just arrived late for group therapy. Uhm, things had happened. I had, had a protected reaction to it. Ah, this particular trip was for me to heal from my divorce and with my cousin who is healing form the death of her husband. And on the way back, as we're flying home I said, "Luz, why do you think we were not there for this?" And she said, "Because I think somebody said, you've had enough this year." Nonetheless, getting back to New York, uhm, it was, I felt very out of step. I felt other people had, had gotten a, a sort of something that I wasn't catching on to. Uhm, as a former news reporter I, I desperately missed being there. As a counselor, I very much wanted to help. But, but the strongest thing was as a mother with two boys in New York. Uhm, you know, I just stayed up all night trying to call them and, and you know, find them. Finally, I got an e-mail from one, you know, and usually it's a very short e-mail from Ted in college and it says, "Hi mom, I'm fine, send money." This e-mail was, uhm, I went up to the top of the roof at school and I looked down 10 miles to the World Trade Center and I saw the smoke and the flames and, and it was very, very upsetting and it reminded me of, uhm, when I was in college at Georgetown and when Martin Luther King was killed and this, (inaudible ) and suddenly there were troops on the streets of Georgetown and there were soldiers in Washington and places were closed and it's the loss of your political innocence in a way that you've been in this very safe world, and I was thinking Ted went through this and experience at the same time. 

01:08:30
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm, uh hmm. One of the things I thought- 

01:08:30
Note Lynn's excellent summary of the client's story 

01:08:30
LYNN BANEZ  -was fascinating about your story, or I still think it's fascinating about your story is that you had gone off to heal from your own personal trauma with your friend... (crosstalk) 

01:08:40
LOUISE LAGUE Uh hmm. 

01:08:40
LYNN BANEZ ...healing from her personal trauma, and yes, to, to some degree, maybe there was a, a, a greater good out, out there... (crosstalk) 

01:08:50
LOUISE LAGUE Yes. 

01:08:50
LYNN BANEZ ...that said, or protecting you from this being in the moment of this bigger trauma yet. (crosstalk) 

01:08:55
LOUISE LAGUE Uh hmm. 

01:08:55
LYNN BANEZ  But then you entered back in and obviously one of the things that's most endearing to me is group work and how you decide it felt like. I was just entering in a group and then they are already moving and working and doing and I was clearly on the off step and how, how do I get back in step with that? How do I jump in to that, respond as a mother. And then almost nine months to the day really uhm, as we're sitting here and talking about this, ah, you've had a chance to ah, work within your community as a, as a counselor. Ah, you and I have talked about, uhm, the importance of ah, groups, the importance of having a spiritual centeredness around this in order to uhm, heal. I wondered if you could speak a little about that. 

01:10:00
LOUISE LAGUE If you look at something like this that is so big and so surprising and so unexpected and touches, uhm, so many people in so many ways. One thing that was interesting about coming home was reading the paper everyday and saying "Oh and now there are... there are businesses that used be there that aren't there anymore". There, there was, there was air that used to be there that isn't anymore. Uhm, there were just astonishing implications that kept unfolding and unfolding. Something like this is certainly, you know, immediate causes is human, but there is something else out there and the, the effect, I think there's something else out there and that that force is always at work both in, in good and bad and of course we've tussled for centuries over why bad things happen, we're not going to solve that today. But, uhm, if in some retrospect when bad things happen, you always have to look at "Okay. What have we learned from that." (crosstalk) 

01:10:55
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:10:55
LOUISE LAGUE  And I don't we're quite there yet but in little ways, in, in little ways, uhm, we're getting there. Uhm, what I noticed uhm, in my practice for example, uhm, in my town, I live in suburb of New York, and first of all I noticed that everyday there were two funerals going up and down the street even if you're just going to the grocery store and trying to go on, uhm, and that's very, uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:11:20
LYNN BANEZ  It causes you to pause for a minute? 

01:11:25
LOUISE LAGUE It really does, you know, and you pause everyday and, and you know people who know people, who know people. We had, I think, 17 from our town who died. Uhm, the next thing that happened was an unemployment group was formed and I'm, I'm leading a group of, of people who have been, ah, who have lost their jobs. And there are so much loss in this whole thing and then to lose your job and the men whose jobs for their whole lives. And ah, we had not gotten to job hunting, which is part of my assignment, because we are dealing with anger, sorrow, loss, one loss on top of another. We haven't had these groups in town for 12 years since, (crosstalk) 

01:12:00
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:12:00
LOUISE LAGUE since the last recession. (crosstalk) 

01:12:00
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:12:00
LOUISE LAGUE  Uhm, among the women that I see privately, people want to get married. They want to have children. (crosstalk) 

01:12:10
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:12:10
LOUISE LAGUE They want more fulfilling careers. (crosstalk) 

01:12:10
LYNN BANEZ  Uh hmm. 

01:12:15
LOUISE LAGUE There's this sudden, uhm, my specialty being mid life issues and which are all spurred by this feeling that, "Oh life is short. What do I wanna do for the rest of it?" It's like the whole country went through that at the same time, in, in 28 year-olds, and 62-year-olds, and... (crosstalk) 

01:12:30
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:12:30
LOUISE LAGUE ...uhm, people want more meaningful jobs. And they want more happiness in their relationships. (crosstalk) 

01:12:35
LYNN BANEZ Hmm. 

01:12:35
LOUISE LAGUE They want more control over their lives, that's something that comes up a lot. So, it has... (crosstalk) 

01:12:40
LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:12:40
LOUISE LAGUE ...changed. Every. 

01:12:40
STOP TAPE What was your personal experience of 9/11? Please share your story in a small group Group Work and Trauma Introduction: What are the images of feelings immediately related to trauma? 

01:12:40
LYNN BANEZ  Okay. We've gathered here today to really talk about ah, our different stories ah, that we've gathered along the way since September 11, nine months later. Ah, the stories that we've lived by, the stories that we've heard ah, and to come together as a group and share those stories and listen to one another and begin to ah, maybe weave a, a tapestry of how we might come together as mental health workers or students learning to be mental health providers, while you've experienced a trauma in taking care of those who've also experienced trauma, not just September 11, but other personal traumas and how might you work with them and how might you take care of yourself in the process. 

01:14:00
  I think it's so important to hear people's stories even if the stories sound a lot alike or even if you've heard them before. There's a tremendous need for, for people not just to talk but also to be heard. 

01:14:20
  I think, uhm, when I think back in September 11, it's one of those things that I always remember what I was doing. Kind of like when Kennedy was assassinated. It was so momentous and so large that you'll always know what you're doing. You know, 40 or 50 years from now you'll hear them say "Oh, remember the September 11 attack. I was in, you know my living room or wherever it was". And for me it was, as I was on my to work and my bestfriend called me and said "You can't go to work today." And I said, "Why can't I go to work today?" And she said, "Because you're driving towards New York and you can't". And I, I mean I never had a TV on. I didn't know anything. And she said, "Turn on the TV. The planes are going into the World Trade Center." And it was just appalling, you know, that first "Wait a minute, this isn't happening here and this isn't happening to us 'cause I think we're all kind of isolated and (inaudible ), I feel that way. Here I am in my own little world and these things aren't going to happen here next to me in my home, in my, where I live. So, it was a very eye-opening. 

01:15:25
 I wonder why we have those memories of exactly where we were and what we're doing when traumatic events occur. 

01:15:30
  Is it a way of grounding ourselves and because that is to connect to something real in your life, uhm, because when you have the image of the planes going into the World Trade Center, that's, you know, that's something that happen to movies, to stories. That doesn't happen in our lives and in our homes. Uhm, Americans by enlarge are very insulated from any of that. (crosstalk) 

01:15:50
 Uh hmm. 

01:15:50
  And so to be connected to something very ordinary, I think makes it possible to think about it in a way that you've probably couldn't without that, that hook, that grounding, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:16:05
 Uh hmm. 

01:16:05
 I was washing the breakfast dishes, I was driving to work, I was, you know, (inaudible ), I was on a school bus when we heard, you know. Those sorts of things. 

01:16:15
 So, you immediately become aware of the most trivial, just little tiny details about be there now. What's going on now. (crosstalk) 

01:16:20
 (inaudible ) information that says you know I'm still here, I'm still alive. There is some connection to something safe. You know, washing the dishes, what could be a more mundane and safe activity than washing dishes? 

01:16:30
 I think it's partly that and I think it's also because we need to do so much in our own selves to come to reality. 

01:16:40
STOP TAPE Where were you on 9/11? Can you recall the visual images, the body feelings, and the thoughts that occurred to you? Beginning to Make Sense from Experience 

01:16:40
ALI TAEB How do we process it though as therapists, counselors and psychologists? How did, what's the best way to process it and at the same time we could help others? 

01:17:05
 Uh hmm. 

01:17:05
 Uh hmm. 

01:17:05
ALI TAEB So that's what we as all professionals, we have to understand. 

01:17:10
 Right. I mean I can, I know that at first I was absolutely in denial. I was, I was in Washington and was, had a flight that afternoon to go some place else from there, and called and made arrangements for the flight to go the next morning. I mean as if the next morning was going to be normal, you know. Uhm, so that was one of the things when I had clients tell me about their reaction. It, it gave a little more insight in terms of how we protect ourselves for a while but then we need to come to terms with it. (crosstalk) 

01:17:40
ALI TAEB When we talk about normal, what do we see as normal anyway? 

01:17:45
 Well, I think it depends on of what your life is like. 

01:17:45
ALI TAEB Right. Exactly. That's true. 

01:17:50
 But I think you can say that, you know, not normal is having airplanes flying to the World Trade Center and that, you know, (crosstalk) 

01:17:55
 'Coz we never experienced but you talked to your parents, you know... (crosstalk) 

01:18:00
 Well, (crosstalk) 

01:18:00
 ...who could who can, you know, live through wars and have faith, faith... (crosstalk) 

01:18:05
DR. LYNN BANEZ Well, let's... (crosstalk) 

01:18:05
 ...but again never on our, in our... (crosstalk) 

01:18:05
 Well, that's true. 

01:18:05
 ...on ourselves, not in our country. And that must be the difference. (crosstalk) 

01:18:10
DR. LYNN BANEZ Let's just, let's just back, back this up a little bit and try to move away from the image of the World Trade Center and get to the realities of day to day life because we've all moved back into day to day life somehow. Somehow, I think still responding to what has happened. Somehow able to do what it is we do, work with others, heal others, facilitate change and growth either in individual work or marriage and family work or group work. So, you know, as you kind of tease away from the event and look at day to day, you know, multiple losses. People looking for jobs and coming down to still some losses. Some basic grounding and, in all of this there's got to be some spiritual sense that's gonna take care of us somehow. Well, what we do with... (crosstalk) 

01:19:25
 As you know, a part of my story at that time was my mother was dying. Uhm, and she did die on January 4th and in a way there was a huge, and it sounds odd to say, but very helpful result from September 11th because it, it really made me very certain about what I need to do to ease my mother's passing. What I need to do for her. What I need to do for me that made me certain that her spiritual life and her health in all sense, that very holistic sense of her health needed to be of focus for me, needed to be the thing that I supported... (crosstalk) 

01:20:05
DR. LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:20:05
 ...and I, you know, it wasn't that I was uncertain about that in, in any way before I got to that, but it made it easier in some ways for me to actually execute that because I saw that as part of healing. (crosstalk) 

01:20:20
DR. LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:20:20
 That huge wound that we had all received that if I could do that one thing, if I could keep that picture of my mother's whole health being held in my hands and move forward... (crosstalk) 

01:20:35
DR. LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:20:35
DR. LYNN BANEZ ...because the ending was certain as you know she wasn't, she wasn't getting better from where she was. She's 84 years old and she, you know, she, she was where she was. But how she got to the ending was really critical... (crosstalk) 

01:20:45
DR. LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:20:45
DR. LYNN BANEZ ...to me and made it a, a much richer experience for me because I held my mind that was part of healing... (crosstalk) 

01:20:50
DR. LYNN BANEZ  Uh-hmm. 

01:20:55
 ...that I need to do. And, and what was taken away from us was our ability to have what we want in our life and made us reassess what it is we do want in our lives. And that for me made it very certain for me that that was the thing that I was going to do is what mother needed in her life, what she wanted and sometimes that was the fiction of the fact that she would get well... (crosstalk) 

01:21:15
DR. LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:21:15
 ...and go back to her normal life.(crosstalk) 

01:21:15
DR. LYNN BANEZ  Uh hmm. 

01:21:20
 Uhm, that was the, the thing that needed to be done was to, to move that forward in that way and I was thinking of it as actually it's, it's a circular thing. (crosstalk) 

01:21:25
DR. LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:21:25
  And I think that helped me heal from, from both of those things, more of healing at the same time. 

01:21:35
 I think introspection also is a part of healing. And I think the introspection that each person does separately and that as, you know, help professionals we can help people to do. Uhm, I guess people in touch with what as Veronica said, the, the important things in your lives puts things in perspective. But also I think made uhm, a lot of people look at their lives and the things that they didn't have time for and the things they did. And part of me what they didn't have for was their spiritual selves. (crosstalk) 

01:22:00
DR. LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:22:00
  And it kind of helped people get back in touch with that. And, and I think that, you know, as they say it, working with people or trying to help them heal, getting them in touch with some of those feelings that they're, that they're experiencing, that maybe they hadn't experienced for a while. 

01:22:20
DR. LYNN BANEZ So, maybe then in some sense, it, it, it really heightens our need and our ability to, we've got to be aware that people have a spiritual peace to them and we need to attend to that to help them grow and change and heal at multiple levels depending on what it is they have specifically... (crosstalk) 

01:22:45
 Uh hmm. 

01:22:45
DR. LYNN BANEZ  sought us out for. 

01:22:50
STOP TAPE What do you observe in this group? How might "internalized oppression" work in these clients? What are your thoughts about spirituality and meaning in relation and meaning relation to trauma? The Impact of Discrimination 

01:22:50
ALI TAEB  In a way it was a tough, really tough moment for me. (crosstalk) 

01:22:55
DR. LYNN BANEZ He wasn't just a 17 or 18-year-old. He was a... (crosstalk) 

01:23:00
ALI TAEB That's true. That's true. 

01:23:05
DR. LYNN BANEZ Right. I think we can leave that, that piece at all. (crosstalk) 

01:23:05
ALI TAEB It was really tough in a way because you have to come to school. You cannot miss school. If you missed school, then you are considered a bad student, but they wouldn't understand why you missed school because, "Hey! I missed school because kids are picking on me and I can't study well and I can't listen in class." (crosstalk) 

01:23:25
DR. LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:23:25
 Uh hmm. 

01:23:25
ALI TAEB So, it was all confusing and not many people understood me. 

01:23:30
DR. LYNN BANEZ So, you... (crosstalk) 

01:23:30
  What would you have liked the counselor to do? I mean, give us some advice to. 

01:23:35
ALI TAEB  Maybe to talk to my teachers or maybe even understand me. They took it so lightly. That's what I'm talking about.(crosstalk) 

01:23:45
 Uh hmm. 

01:23:45
ALI TAEB They, they didn't really understand me, where I'm coming from. They thought maybe I'm making an ex, excuse. Then they thought, they really didn't really know what was exactly going on. They didn't know Persian Gulf War. Okay. What I mean, (crosstalk) 

01:23:55
DR. LYNN BANEZ Do you think they didn't understand that the level and the depth that, of what that discrimination felt like to you? 

01:24:00
ALI TAEB  No, I explained it. I explained.(crosstalk) 

01:24:05
DR. LYNN BANEZ Right, maybe you, you could talk about it, but I, I, I think sometimes when I work with uhm, you know, clients who were, quote, unquote, minority... (crosstalk) 

01:24:15
 Uhm. 

01:24:15
DR. LYNN BANEZ ...clients, and, I don't like to use that word, so I put in quotations. But that uhm, they just don't feel like you really understand the pain of what it is. The isolation of what it is. (crosstalk) 

01:24:30
ALI TAEB Exactly. They didn't understand. (crosstalk) 

01:24:30
 Yeah. But I'm wondering if, if the fact that you were 17-year-old was working against you because maybe the generalization of 17-year-olds don't wanna do the work in school. They wanna find an excuse to not, not be there or wherever. (crosstalk) 

01:24:40
ALI TAEB  Sure, but, (crosstalk) 

01:24:45
 So, that, that was... (crosstalk) 

01:24:45
LYNN BANEZ, PH.D. Okay.(crosstalk) 

01:24:45
 ...kind of the mistake that was made. 

01:24:45
DR. LYNN BANEZ This is, this is, this is excellent because this gives us a glimpse of possibly, I'm not saying that you're doing this, but possibly of how someone could feel not hurt. Maybe, it's he's just 17 or 18. (crosstalk) 

01:25:00
 I am not, I am not saying that was right. I am saying that maybe that was what happened. 

01:25:05
DR. LYNN BANEZ Let me say that. That's a, as a, as a teaching moment. Yeah, yeah, mothers ah, you know that here is person trying to, you know, you know like running this into you again. Okay. It's, it's about who I am. It's not that I am 17. It's not that I am a, a 17-year-old boy, you know, a young man. You know struggling and, no. It's that, it's my culture. It's my ethnicity. It's who I am. It's my religion that, that's being challenged, and now it's being challenged again. So, you know, to, to make it current, you know, avoid a scenario of. Okay, let's say this is happening in your job and you say, what. I'm making, I, I understand it. (crosstalk) 

01:25:50
ALI TAEB I do understand it. 

01:25:50
DR. LYNN BANEZ But at the same time you know... (crosstalk) 

01:25:55
ALI TAEB But I don't accept it, but I understand it. (crosstalk) 

01:25:55
DR. LYNN BANEZ ...you want the, you want the counselor to know this, this is painful. This is wrong. 

01:26:00
ALI TAEB But I wouldn't go to a counselor. I, I would rely heavily on my own family and my good friends. 

01:26:10
 So, within that group you and your family talked about what it's like to be Arab American today. Have you talked about that with your family? 

01:26:20
ALI TAEB We have. You see Iranian, they don't consider to be Arabs. Arabs are Muslims and Muslims, it's, it's, it's kinda a little bit confusing maybe for you guys, but uhm, Iranians consider to be Persians and Arabs are Arabs and Muslims can be from Iran, Persian, (crosstalk) 

01:26:45
  Right. 

01:26:50
ALI TAEB from Turkey, from Malaysia, Philippines, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:26:50
DR. LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:26:50
ALI TAEB But uhm, as a Muslim-American, sure, no doubt, it was a tough time. But we all knew at the same time that it's, it wasn't the first time that this has happened to be discriminated against. I mean this discrimination goes on. Not just toward Muslims or Jews, toward Hispanics, toward Blacks... (crosstalk) 

01:27:15
DR. LYNN BANEZ But that's, that's two... (crosstalk) 

01:27:15
ALI TAEB ...so, you have to get keep an open mind. 

01:27:20
DR. LYNN BANEZ ...that's two, that's two critical pieces of information, though, that I think that you've shared... (crosstalk) 

01:27:20
 Uh hmm. 

01:27:20
DR. LYNN BANEZ ...you know, with the group here and then with the larger audience that you know, this is not new to us. During the Gulf War this happened... (crosstalk) 

01:27:35
ALI TAEB Oh, sure. 

01:27:35
DR. LYNN BANEZ ...and to, you know, for me as a person from Iran, that it's not that. It's that I'm Muslim. 

01:27:45
ALI TAEB Right. 

01:27:45
DR. LYNN BANEZ And not that I am Arab-American even thought people might want to put me in that category... (crosstalk) 

01:27:50
ALI TAEB Right. 

01:27:50
DR. LYNN BANEZ ...because I, (crosstalk) 

01:27:50
 It's not what you look like. 

01:27:50
DR. LYNN BANEZ  Exactly.(crosstalk) 

01:27:55
ALI TAEB Right. 

01:27:55
DR. LYNN BANEZ Which is a, a learning piece... (crosstalk) 

01:27:55
 Yes. 

01:27:55
DR. LYNN BANEZ ...would you think?(crosstalk) 

01:27:55
  Uh hmm. 

01:28:00
DR. LYNN BANEZ ...that it could help others maybe feel more hurt, and more understood? 

01:28:00
ALI TAEB  Definitely. 

01:28:05
 The other learning piece that I think was really important that he said is that you wouldn't seek therapy now. (crosstalk) 

01:28:10
DR. LYNN BANEZ Uh hmm. 

01:28:10
 Having had less than satisfactory experience the first time. And I think that as now help professionals we need to be so aware of that. 

01:28:20
THE ISSUE OF INTERNALIZED OPPRESSION 

01:28:20
DR. LYNN BANEZ But you're also having a lot of, you know, a lot of Muslim-American or Arab-American... (crosstalk) 

01:28:30
 Uh hmm. 

01:28:30
DR. LYNN BANEZ ...uhm, people changing their children's names to more American names. So, if they're not picked on and that was something that, actually, Ali and I talked about when we first met of what was his name really, and what would he prefer to be called. 

01:28:50
 So you changed your name to Oliver. 

01:28:50
ALI TAEB  Yes, that was during that 1990 Persian Gulf War. 

01:28:55
 And you did that on your own as a 17-year-old? 

01:29:00
ALI TAEB Ah, pretty much. Yeah. 

01:29:00
 So, (crosstalk) 

01:29:00
ALI TAEB Because when I wanted to start college, I wanted to start fresh in a way. So, if those kind of incidents happened like the Persian Gulf War again or incidence with, in, with the Muslim-Americans, I didn't want to be dragged into it, but that, that's what a lot of people do... (crosstalk) 

01:29:25
 Uh hmm. 

01:29:25
 Uh hmm. 

01:29:25
ALI TAEB ...to get in the crowd. Uhm, I'm 100% sure that each of you guys know someone. It doesn't matter if they are Muslims, they are Jewish, they are Hispanic, that has changed something about themselves... (crosstalk) 

01:29:40
 Uh hmm. 

01:29:40
ALI TAEB ...or they have done something... (crosstalk) 

01:29:40
 Uh hmm. 

01:29:40
ALI TAEB ...to be accepted... (crosstalk) 

01:29:45
 Uh hmm. 

01:29:45
 Uh hmm. 

01:29:45
ALI TAEB ...at an early age. 

01:29:45
 Uh hmm. 

01:29:45
ALI TAEB I've, I've had many friends like that. 

01:29:50
DR. LYNN BANEZ You know, I do, I just seem to think of, you know, the gay-straight student alliances in schools. How kids have come together and you know carried a rainbow flag or have a little rainbow sticker. So, you don't know, you know, who's necessarily is ah, gay or straight or it's a way that they can all blend in and be allies and say we are who we are. And nobody should be picked on or, or bullied. And I thought to myself what an interesting exercise if everybody would say, let's say we were meeting as a, as an ongoing group. Everybody decided we would, we would pick Muslim names. 

01:30:35
 Uh hmm. 

01:30:35
DR. LYNN BANEZ And work, and live and understand what that would be. You know, it's just a point to ponder it. 

01:30:45
 Well, it's ah, it's ah, when I talked about being afraid and not want to do certain things, I have a hard time really imagining that 'coz that's never happened to me. A, it's a blatant way. So, that's just different. 

01:31:00
DR. LYNN BANEZ 'Coz you haven't think about that.(crosstalk) 

01:31:00
 Uh hmm. 

01:31:00
DR. LYNN BANEZ  You get calls to question you know, what is our, what is our role in helping people heal and helping countries heal, and you know I am just gonna go right back to the group, and say, you know groups facilitates change, growth, and healing. And, you know, people met in groups almost naturally in response to trauma and you see that in families. As families... (crosstalk) 

01:31:40
ALI TAEB Uh hmm. 

01:31:40
 Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:31:40
DR. LYNN BANEZ  in trauma, you know, regardless of what the trauma is. They come together. Our friends come together around the trauma. They form groups. So, part of our role, I think, perhaps was to form some kind of groups that can begin to facilitate healing within communities ah, in group, by group, by group and making strands of healing. That's the way I see it. I don't know school tapestry of groups and working for change. Groups that, to advocate. All different kinds of group.
