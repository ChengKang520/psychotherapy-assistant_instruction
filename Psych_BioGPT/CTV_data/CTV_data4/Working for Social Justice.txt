WORKING FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE 

00:00:00
THE ETHICS & CORE VALUES OF SOCIAL WORK 

00:00:00
MONIQUE FLETCHER, MSW 

00:00:05
MONIQUE FLETCHER I was probably in my sophomore year undergrad and I'm reading through the, the catalogue and looking at the courses and saying, wow, oh my god, they're so amazing. They're so interesting. I wanna be a social worker. So, and I talked to my parents and I said I, I wanna be a social worker. They said, no, no, no, don't be a social worker. Cuz, you don't wanna be a social worker, um, you don't get paid a lot of money and, you know, you worked so hard in college, you're too smart to be a social worker. And, um, and as I shared it with other people they had the same response. And, you know, it was kinda deflating cuz I was so excited about this new adventure I was about to go on and it really gave me more encouragement to prove them wrong. That I can be a social worker and I can be successful and I can make huge changes and, and really affect society. 

00:00:50
PETER LESKO, LCSW-R 

00:00:55
PETER LESKO My education in being upper school social work at SU really helped me to sort of, uh, hone in on the skills that I needed to kinda take what was my personal experience and help me to kinda put that drive in perspective and recognize what I could do on a professional level. 

00:01:10
MARY JENSEN, MSW 

00:01:10
MARY JENSEN I didn't really enter the school social work willingly. I didn't think it was gonna be worth my time or money. I'm happy to say it was worth both and I'm very grateful for, uh, everything I learned there. 

00:01:25
STEVE SMITH 

00:01:25
STEVE SMITH This is the last profession I ever thought that I would enter. And, in fact, I probably tried everything else, uh, only to realize that my, my hearts desire and I believe my destiny is in social work. And has been now for the last, uh, 25 years. 

00:01:40
LIETTE DENNIS, LCSW-R 

00:01:40
LIETTE DENNIS I wake up in the morning for the years that I've, that I've, you know, since I graduated in 1987 and I'm grateful that I can go to work and do social work. 

00:01:50
ADRIENNE RENFROE, LMSW 

00:01:50
ADRIENNE RENFROE You have a, really some very concrete ways that you can effect change. And so you're able to take the, the idea of, I wanna help, I wanna make a difference and actually make that difference. 

00:02:05
JACQUE TARA WASHINGTON, LMSW 

00:02:05
JACQUE TARA WASHINGTON I don't know that everybody knows all the things that social workers do and, uh, but I do know that when people talk about social workers, for the most part they talk about how they help them. And, whether it's in a hospital setting or in a school setting or, you know, hmm, in a rehabilitation center or at, you know, in a, uh, uh, community center. I mean, wherever we are, we're all over the place. People do say we help them. And that's what our profession is, we're a helping profession. 

00:02:40
SERVICE 

00:02:40
MONIQUE FLETCHER My main focus is children in families in poverty. With the West Side Community School strategy the whole focus of this, of this initiative is to not only give the services that the kids need in the schools and in the community but also to assess the service gaps and the service barriers. 

00:03:00
PETER LESKO I've worked with a lot of people who have tried to kill themselves. Hmm, particularly adolescents and in particular gay and lesbian. Hmm, high numbers from the ages of 15 to 24. 

00:03:15
JACQUE TARA WASHINGTON I work with clients who are recovering from alcohol and other drugs in a six month, uh, residential facility. 

00:03:20
LIETTE DENNIS The new jail was about ready to open and we were looking for ways of making the services to the inmate population that needed mental health, um, mental health services at the inmate population. We, we developed a program that was more comprehensive than any other county program in the state. 

00:03:50
MARY JENSEN We're now focusing on the need for women with children and their need for substance abuse treatment and we're very focused on the fact that there's absolutely no place for women with minor children to go inpatient or bring their children with them. So we are, um, in the process of trying to open a residence for women who need substance abuse treatment to go, to live with their children. 

00:04:10
JACQUE TARA WASHINGTON We teach about alcohol and drug education. We teach about, um, early recovery, um, relapse prevention, social support, emotions, um, life skills. I mean, we look at the whole, the whole person. 

00:04:25
STEVE SMITH So much of what I do, uh, involves seeing students who have low self worth and are really struggling. Trying to, uh, understand hope they can cope with that. 

00:04:40
PETER LESKO A lot of what these kids needed was one person who was willing to show up on a consistent basis every week and to be the connection. And so I stepped forward and, uh, probably about six years ago made the decision that every Thursday night I would be that person who is there from seven till nine. And, uh, that opened the door for them to build relationships with me and then for me to also build relationships with their families, with their parents. 

00:05:10
SOCIAL JUSTICE 

00:05:10
PETER LESKO One of the key things that I'm getting involved in is going to Albany to do some lobbying. Trying to inform, uh, some of the senators and people that might actually hear and make some policy decisions around, uh, laws that could be put into place that would be, uh, create some protection for adolescents who are in high school settings that are dealing with, uh, um, sexual bias, um, harassment, bashing, bullying. 

00:05:35
JACQUE TARA WASHINGTON I think even before I got my degree I was a social worker. I just didn't have the credentials. Because I was always concerned about, um, justice for people. For all people. For all populations. For teenagers, for little ones, for the elderly, uh, for people of color, um, just, for women. Just wanting there to be a fairness. Across the board fairness. 

00:06:05
MONIQUE FLETCHER I found myself being a social worker 24 hours a day. And so I found myself intervening and I don't know why but, um, you know, at the mall where I feel that a security guard might be a little too rough on a kid. 

00:06:20
PETER LESKO We are really stepping into the role and we are always intervening in some way with what's going on. On a family level, on a community level and on a macro level with the rest of society too. 

00:06:30
ADRIENNE RENFROE We really get great people. People who are interested in making a change. Whether it's, um, an individual family society level, um, really have a commitment to social justice. 

00:06:40
PETER LESKO There's education needed across all communities that these things do exist. That people are dealing with being at risk for suicide. That there are people in the community that are active alcoholics and addicts. That addiction does exist and people do need help and services that are not yet in place to serve these individuals. 

00:07:05
DIGNITY & WORTH OF A PERSON 

00:07:05
ADRIENNE RENFROE We really are so much more similar than we are different. Everyone has the same basic needs, um, and most people are really doing the very best with the current skills and abilities that they have. 

00:07:20
PETER LESKO Well, one of the biggest things is start where the client is at. And to continue to re, remember that each and every day when I walk into work that that person sitting across from me deserves the same respect that I would any other individual. 

00:07:30
MONIQUE FLETCHER And in excepting the way other people are. Being okay with that and being okay that, you know, this is where we start. 

00:07:40
LIETTE DENNIS The people that we see in the jail system are not their crime. That they are human beings that deserve as much respect, um, as you can give them. 

00:07:55
JACQUE TARA WASHINGTON When they, um, say, um, I'm an alcoholic I say, well, you're not really an alcoholic. You are a human being and you have a problem with alcohol. 

00:08:05
LIETTE DENNIS They're at their lowest possible, um, point. And we have, um, responsibility as a social worker to be able to recognize inside how you're responding to them. How do you, as an individual, respond to this person who has maybe done something that was in the paper. That is a murder charge or a, a serious crime against a child. 

00:08:35
JACQUE TARA WASHINGTON It, it's hard. It's really hard to instill dignity and worth in someone. And self esteem is not something that you can instill in someone. Self esteem is something that a person has to develop on their own. That's why it's, it's self. So it's like every, every little step that they take I tell them, okay, that's a pat on the back, you know, recognize that, you now, because that's how you build self esteem. It's not someone telling you, it's you telling yourself, 'I did a good job here, you know, this is really good so I'm gonna feel good about this.' And for a lot of them they feel like, oh, I'm, I can say that? I can say that I did a good job? I can say that I'm, I'm proud of myself? Yes. You can. 

00:09:10
MARY JENSEN I was introduced to the concept of cultural humility which I love. I must tell you it taught me that I can approach every single person regardless of their circumstances and believe that they have something to teach me. And it's been magical. 

00:09:30
IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS 

00:09:35
ADRIENNE RENFROE If you are willing to believe that there's always opportunity for growth then there's always opportunity for change. Um, and you meet someone where, right where they are you will find so many things to, um, to give positive feedback about. 

00:09:50
MONIQUE FLETCHER Once they realize that you're there for them and you're there to service them then they'll, it's an open book after that. And it's, makes our relationship and working together a lot easier. 

00:10:00
ADRIENNE RENFROE Tell me who you are. Tell me what you hope for. Hmm, and let's see how we can work together. 

00:10:10
STEVE SMITH What we really try to do is essentially and very, uh, very quickly develop a relationship with this individual, uh, that is, uh, supportive and, uh, where we can convey a level of, uh, um, respect for that individual. Where we can express, uh, a concern for the dignity of that individual. Where we can begin to almost unbury this treasure that is inside the individual. Uh, a treasure that perhaps the individual is unaware of. 

00:10:40
PETER LESKO People do open their hearts to us. They open their lives to us. They allow us to walk into their lives, uh, give us permission to be part of the journey that they're experiencing. And that is not something that comes lightly. 

00:10:55
MONIQUE FLETCHER Peoples goals are really sacred to them and it's, it's a lot, especially with young people. They're so kinda afraid to share their goals because they're afraid of what people's response will be. 

00:11:05
PETER LESKO In the initial steps of connecting with people that it's definitely about allowing them to just be again, you know, just start where they're at. 

00:11:15
ADRIENNE RENFROE When people realize that you're not judging them, you're not there to, um, tell them all the things that they've done right or wrong but to help them develop what they'd like to, to do. Hmm, then it quickly changes the, the interaction. 

00:11:35
STEVE SMITH How can I fine tune my listening so I really, really hear what that persons trying to say. Certainly on a superficial level, but on various other levels as well. How can I create an intimacy, a professional intimacy, between myself and that person so that person clearly recognizes that he or she is being understood. 

00:12:00
PETER LESKO We have to break down some walls when we do that and so some of those, some of that takes time and a lot of trust and relationship building and communication that really continues to just show that I care. 

00:12:15
JACQUE TARA WASHINGTON It's not a matter of just, of just telling somebody trust me. That doesn't really work but if we, if I set a time that I'm gonna meet with them I make sure that I'm there. Um, we have, I facilitate like six groups and each time I'm there on time so that they know they can trust I'm gonna be there on time. If I say I'm gonna do something I do it and I expect the same from them. So, I hold them accountable for that because it's not just a one way street with this relationship. 

00:12:45
INTEGRITY 

00:12:50
MONIQUE FLETCHER My believe in integrity is what you do when no-one's watching. 

00:12:50
PETER LESKO Thinking about integrity, the easiest, the statement that comes to my mind is really walking the walk that you talk. 

00:13:00
JACQUE TARA WASHINGTON Integrity, to me, is, is about being honest. Being truthful, trustworthy and not just with my clients but with my colleagues as well. 

00:13:15
LIETTE DENNIS Working in the criminal justice system requires you to be honest, um, to challenge, um, the system in a way that is positive. 

00:13:25
MARY JENSEN I, um, think about integrity in terms of the people who fund us. We, if we accept funding, if we apply for funding we need to do what we say we're going to do. We need to not only be honest and trustworthy with our clients but we need to be honest and trustworthy with the people who fund us. 

00:13:45
LIETTE DENNIS I guess I see my job as a administrator of a program to protect the integrity of the program. And by that I, and how I do that is by assuring that the people that we have working in our, in our program are, um, treating our population with respect and caring and, um, um, integrity. 

00:14:15
JACQUE TARA WASHINGTON I want people to, when, when they think about me, when they say my name, when they talk about me I want them to say those things. I want them to say that she's, she has integrity, that she's trustworthy. That she's, that she's honest. So when I say something they don't have to second guess it. They're gonna, they know that if I say it then it's gonna happen. And, uh, and that's really important for my clients because they need to be able to, to develop that, you know, to be able to say this person told me something. And I didn't trust it at first, why should I, you know, I mean, all my life people have told me things and, and, and, didn't come through. Now this is one of the, the few people in my life right now who's telling me things and I'm, and I'm, I'm believing 'em. And I'm trusting it and, and I can count on it. 

00:15:05
PETER LESKO I'm also very careful about how I discuss my clients and the words that I use to discuss them. You know, other people behind closed doors will say things that can be hurtful or harmful if they were heard outside of closed doors. 

00:15:20
STEVE SMITH I can reveal my integrity through, uh, through the confidence that, uh, that I share with, uh, the other person. Uh, I believe that that other person then can, uh, feel safe and willing to, uh, to talk about some very, you know, vulnerable and intimate aspects of the persons life. 

00:15:40
COMPETENCE 

00:15:45
STEVE SMITH Social work is such a noble profession and one of the reasons that, that I say that is because when we engage someone in a professional setting we, in so many words, are saying to that individual, I am going to walk you through this. And for as long as you and I know each other in this setting I am committing myself to that effort. 

00:16:05
PETER LESKO I am recovering from alcohol and drug abuse, hmm, so I was dealing with that issue. When I got sober and when I went to school. And so the stake for me in the field of being personally involved is remembering to keep that piece on the side. And to remember my education so that what I'm doing doesn't ethically compromise the people that I'm working with. Knowing that what worked for me isn't gonna always work for them. That, that what I've been trained in is what I need to do when I walk into the office. 

00:16:35
MARY JENSEN It's not just about having a good heart. It's about having the education. It's about, um, having the skills to, uh, help level the playing field. To, to make a difference. It's not just about me going to work every day thinking, oh, aren't I a good person, I care about women and children. It's about me going to work every day saying, I think I know what we can do to help women with children. 

00:17:00
MONIQUE FLETCHER I was on a train and they were talking about left handed people and how the phone isn't set up for left handed people, scissors, and they, they're going on and on about the different, uh, different things that weren't set up for people that were left handed and I, I thought, oh man, would you get off of it already and then I thought, wait a little minute, you know, that's not fair. Um, if, if, um, uh, African Americans were standing up talking about their issues and their concerns I would have a problem with someone saying get off of it already. And so, really, constantly checking yourself and where your feelings come from. And are you displaying any isms, uh, that are, are unfair to others. And I think that's a strength because I constantly work from that place. 

00:17:45
STEVE SMITH I realize that I had been seeing a lot of families over a period of time where they're were affected by alcohol and drugs. And I realized at that point too how little I knew about what that meant. And so I thought I'd better learn. Uh, it took me a while to come to that conclusion but I, I got to a point where I realized that, uh, that in order for me to offer some, um, some benefit to the people who I was seeing I needed to learn more. 

00:18:15
JACQUE TARA WASHINGTON it, it's so fascinating to me to, to learn as much as I can learn about whatever it is that I'm involved in. And that way I can share it with my clients as well so they become educated. So that they, they understand exactly what's going on with this addiction, you know. They're not in the dark anymore. You know, what's happening, you know, what you need to do. You know how you, how, that you have to do thought stopping techniques and all these kind of things to help you in your, in your recovery. So whatever I learn I can pass on to them. 

00:18:45
PETER LESKO I continue to believe that most social workers, and I know that I know, are functioning well in the field, um, have moved out of the role of being expert and more into the role of being a guide and a facilitator. And somebody who walks with the person they're serving versus walks in front of the person that they're serving. 

00:19:05
MAKING A DIFFERENCE 

00:19:05
PETER LESKO I know that I can make a difference and that one, one person can affect change, um, you know, and, and recognizing that change can come from my being a part of a relationship with another individual. 

00:19:20
MONIQUE FLETCHER I feel empowered. I feel, um, that I'm really working to give people a voice. 

00:19:25
LIETTE DENNIS If you can hold onto that piece of dignity that they're demonstrating to you that you will, you would, you will be able to work with them. You will be able to help them. Um, and it's your job as a social worker to do that. 

00:19:40
ADRIENNE RENFROE I've just had so many people who've believed in me and who've been able to support me through the journey. And so whenever I have an opportunity to, um, offer any type of support or to en, offer encouragement to someone else it really makes me feel like I, feel good to have an opportunity to, to give back. 

00:20:05
STEVE SMITH I really do believe that I, I am blessed, and blessed to be a social worker. 

00:20:10
MARY JENSEN I am so happy to be a social worker. I go to work every day happy to be there. 

00:20:15
JACQUE TARA WASHINGTON I absolutely love going to work. My clients look for me. They see my car driving up in the driveway and it's like, they're there at the door. And it's like, sometimes you, you have to say, okay, just give me a few minutes to just, just to, you know, to get myself together here. But they count on me, you know, they count on me. And I know I'm making a difference. I know I'm making a difference in their lives and so that really makes me feel good. 

00:20:40
