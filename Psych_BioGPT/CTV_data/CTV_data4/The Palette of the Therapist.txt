KATHRYN LANE ROSSI Fantastic! Good afternoon everyone and welcome to what's a going to prove to be a very exciting afternoon. I'm absolutely thrilled beyond measure to introduce my dear friend, Dr. Jeffrey Zeig and well, I completely admired Dr. Michael Bond and the fact that he's been recognize as one of the top psychotherapist in the world today. In my mind, Jeff is number one. Jeff does more for the world of psychotherapist as right now. Wouldn't you agree? I agree. It's my opinion. So we're going with it today because not only did he organize his conference with his staff and all of the other evolution of psychotherapies but he organizes Brief Therapy, the Couples Conferences, the Ericksonian Congresses and more and he does this with great love and he listens to every single speaker that's recorded, he read their books, he has a wealth of information but what we get to hear today is even greater. We get to hear what is passions are, what he's developing, the idea of having an impact in the world, the idea of what are the antecedence of change in going more with, with then with pathology but looking at the arts and so, I encourage you to go, ah, it's impact.com? 

00:01:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Emotional impact. 

00:01:25
KATHRYN LANE ROSSI Emotionalimpact.com and to be paying attention to the many interviews that he's doing in the books that will be coming out because it's really exciting. He's contributing massively to our field and he's discussing Dr. Michael Bond is a and he almost needs no words but the idea that he is really helping to, ah, eradicate violence and to, to bring our, our nature to it I think is really extraordinary and so he'll be on later in the afternoon. So welcome. 

00:01:55
Welcome! Jeffrey Zeig, PhD Director and Founder, The Milton H Erickson Foundation www.erickson-foundation.org The Evolution of Psychotherapy www.evolutionofpsychotherapy.com 2013 AHAHEIM 

00:01:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Ah, thank you so much. Thank you. Okay, so I'm going to need a lot of slides for this presentation and I'm really delighted to have done as a discussant, I don't know if I'll be so delighted after his discussion but, ah, at this moment I delighted and, ah, certainly his contributions to psychotherapy and he's really one of our most popular speakers and always has been one of the most highly raided speakers at the Evolution conference and what makes him highly raided as a speaker is that he takes excellence and he improves it. And this is going to be part of the thee for today. Ah, I'm going to assume that all of you are excellent and that you're excellent at doing psychotherapy excellent at living and then the question, is how do we improve excellence? How do we make excellent a little bit more excellent? And as many of you know, what my project has been is its been studying the arts and all of the arts and trying to understand some of the aspects of art that can be incorporated into psychotherapy, not the aspect s of art but structural aspects of art. This is not art therapy but its understanding that art moves the human spirit, art moves the human soul, art changes perception and art changes our state and if we want to help other people change their perception, change their state well, art is been much more significant in our history than psychotherapy. And so, we can learn things from artists that can take our excellence and make it even a little more excellent and I'm going to do something that's little unusual, a little out of the box because partly in this type of presentation, the medium is the message so it's not going to be a normal kind of academic program and we even have a volunteer path who is going to help me because I'm going to do some "hypnotic" procedures so that I can illustrate some of the concepts that I'll be talking about. 

00:04:15
Jeff! (An EVOCATIVE depiction of my implicit character) Evocative Presentations are not always linear The medium is the message Cell Phones off or on Silent, please. My Presentation Evocative Communication Advanced Techniques of Therapy 11 Structural Suggestions Derived from Hypnosis Hypnotherapy without Trance Excellence Improve Assume that each of us is excellent 

00:04:20
JEFFREY ZEIG And, ah, this is about being evocative and of course we should have an evocation depiction of my character and you know, that's me pulling the Milton Erickson card out of my vest. Aha, I love the way Andreas Steiner did that and if you have an evocative presentation it's not always something that's really linear because things that are linear tend to be more scientific whereas things that are evocative well, they may not have the same kind of structure. And, uhm, it's a good time to put your cell phones on silent and this about how can we take thinking from hypnosis and why is it important to take thinking from hypnosis and apply those aspects from hypnosis into the warp and woof of psychotherapy without the necessity of being hypnotist or knowing anything about hypnotic procedures. 

00:05:20
Studying Music: Irish Penny Whistle 

00:05:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Oh yeah, well this is me playing the Penny Whistle. Now, as a, ah, evocative moment, kind of an absurd moment because I can't play worth a damn. I've really tried and, ah, I'd-- I love the instrument but I'm not very good very good at it. Use a, a little tune, this is, ah, an Irish air. 

00:05:50
[music] 

00:06:00
JEFFREY ZEIG It was terrible. Let me try that one more time. 

00:06:05
[music] 

00:06:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Better. Okay, now that was nice. It was interesting. It was okay. It was fun, you know, and, ah, certainly some people appreciated it. So, if, if we said that that was excellent, what could we do that would improve excellence? Try it again. 

00:06:40
[music] 

00:06:40
Studying Music: Irish Penny Whistle 

00:06:50
JEFFREY ZEIG And what makes it a little bit more excellence is adding some elaborations and because I can't really play the instrument adding a slide or adding a doubling of a note doing something that takes basic structure and flashes it out embroiders it and add something a little bit more and I think that if we want to improve the psychotherapist we're going to have to do that but I'm going to have to take some Penny whistle lessons. 

00:07:20
The Palette o the Therapist Therapist do not know how to use evocative communication. Artists do. 

00:07:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so our palette. The palette of the therapist. What do we have that are disposal that allows us to intervene constructively in people's lives and what we have is communication and we really don't learn how to be evocative in our communication but certainly this the purview of artists. Artists learn how to be evocative. They know the first 60 years of psychotherapy the therapist was basically invisible because in order to illicit transference you had to create a situation where the therapist was not influencing the patient and the projections could happen from the patient on to this invisible therapist. 

00:08:10
Available Channels Artists are restricted by their medium and explore the possibilities at their disposal: • Painters: Oils Canvas, and ... • Composers: Tone, Rhythm, Harmony, Tone Color • Poets: Words and the Printed Page Therapist can explore their medium Communication 

00:08:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Now, if you're a painter, you have oils and canvas. If you are a poet, you have a words and the printed page. If you are a composer you are a composer, you have tones, you have timber, tone color, you have rhythm, you have harmony and out of those four elements you create art. And so then, that makes us think, well, what do we have is therapist, what is our palette and what do we-- how can we use our palette to the greatest effect and this is why I study hypnosis because hypnosis teaches me how to use aspects of communication that I have never learned in any a-- any other discipline of psychotherapy. 

00:08:55
Available Channels Therapists can explore the possibilities at their disposal, including: • Expression • Gesture • Voice Qualities: intensity; duration; prosody; direction • Proximity • Sound Effects 

00:08:55
JEFFREY ZEIG So available channels that we have-- that we can explore that add up-- that are at our disposal is that we can use expression and we can use gesture and we can use voice qualities like intensity and duration and prosody, the musicality of our voice and we can use the direction of our voice. And this was what Milton Erickson did. He explored how can you use the output channels of communication to effect, ah, just as the sideline. There was an experiment of field study that he did because he didn't do empirical experiments he was more like an anthropologist doing field studies so he had the president to the American Psychiatric Association visiting and this was quite a while ago before the concept of mind, body interaction was invoke the patient was known to be motion sick. This was a given, the patient had motion sickness and Erickson asked the patient to close his eyes and did a demonstration of hypnosis and as he was doing the demonstration of hypnosis speaking in very neutral tones and not changing his voice tone very much he started to move back and forth as if you're on, ah, ship that was moving back and forth and the patient suddenly develop motion sickness yet his eyes closed. And Erickson exploring could the direction of speech in itself be as efficient cue to cause a physiological response. And so, proximity, these are things that we can use strategically. When you see me doing a demonstration therapy, I'm strategically thinking about all of this things, the tone of my voice, the tempo of my voice, the gestures that I'm using, the posture that I'm using, the proximity that I'm using. I'm adding element, I'm adding embroidery that take excellence and make excellence and make excellence a little bit improve and if you listen to the demonstration that I did the other day, you know, that I was using sound effects in order to create an image for the patient and gestures that I was using to create a visual image for the patient. It just as so pixelating to me that therapists don't make therapy into a visual art. Fifty percent of brain prossing-- processing is dedicated to vision and we don't learn-- I never learned how to create a visual experience for my patient that would make a simple idea strategically come alive. 

00:11:45
Evocative Elements: Some suggestions ➢ It is impossible to list all methods of being evocative; it would be impossible to list all the methods of making any art more advanced. ➢ Therapy must evolve, just as music must. ➢ Therapy has evolved in the last 70 years. I hope it becomes more evocative. 

00:11:45
JEFFREY ZEIG So can't list all of the possible ways of being evocative in communication and what I think is that therapy hasn't been evolving not in the way that art evolves. Composers, musicians they take their medium and they try to do something with it, it's never been done before and visual artist it take their medium, they try to do something with it, that's never been done before and directors they try to do something with their medium that's never been done before and we don't explore our medium just I'm so passionate about this. I don't mean to be polemic but I do mean to let you know my passion and I think that therapy should and has become more evocative over the years. 

00:12:35
Previous investigations Non-specific Factors Evocative elements Standing on the Shoulders of Mentors Who made psychotherapy into an unusual conversation 

00:12:35
JEFFREY ZEIG We could call this something about non-specific factors when we think about non-specific factors in therapy and you listen to Scott Miller and you hear what he says about what makes psychotherapy effective, it's not the technique it is the therapeutic alliance. Now, that's not sufficient for me to think that the therapeutic alliance is a thing, the therapeutic alliance is something that can be made excellent by the way in which the therapist communicates, how the therapist uses his palette and psychotherapy needs to be an unusual conversation. If it's a normal conversation you can have it with a friend. Psychotherapy must be a little weird, unusual. 

00:13:25
Sigmund Freud, M.D. Happy 128th Birthday. Psychotherapy! It was 1885 that Freud first became interested in the psychological aspects of medicine. "Everywhere I go, the poet has already been there before me." Freud can be credited as the first experiential therapist. He made therapy into a completely unusual conversation. Modeling 

00:13:25
JEFFREY ZEIG And Freud certainly was an evocative therapist. If you imagine the end of the Victorian Era and Freud asking the patient to lie down on a couch and speak to the ceiling and say anything that came to his mind-- her mind that is a remarkably evocative experience and people started to get better and they got better quickly at first and then it became systematize and then people got better slowly but at least it was an evocative experience an out of all of the evocative, ah, people. 

00:14:00
My Model? Milton H. Erickson, M.D. Milton H. Erickson, M.D. www.erickson-foundation.org Modeling: My attempts to model Erickson Models of Erickson I started studying hypnosis 40 years ago. I first met Milton Erickson in 1973 And, I am still learning from him. He was the master of evocative therapy. Milton H. Erickson, MD Father of Modern Hypnosis Innovator in Brief Psychotherapy Milton Erickson circa 1975 Milton H. Erickson, M.D. (1901-1980) Erickson was the quintessential, most radical experiential therapist. Milton H. Erickson, M.D. www.erickson-foundation.org Implicit Influence Evocative Communication Reference experiences The Foundation of Realizations Modeling Art Evocative Communication The Purview of Art 

00:14:00
JEFFREY ZEIG My model has been Milton Erickson who was radically experiential, radically evocative and not didactic not in the linear sense. And, ah, so I have attempted over the years since 1973, 40 years when I first met Milton Erickson, it's been a modeling technique. Modeling is the best part of neurolinguistic programming. In modeling, you look around the world and you find something excellent and then, you do this, and then you do this, and then you do this. Now, I have excellent and what I mean by that graphic is you find something that's excellent, you move it closer, you start to chunk it down into its components and then you start practicing with the components. If you look at the demonstration that I did the other day, you will see cohesion. Now, cohesion was one of the things that I talk about with James Foley that he did in his movies for example where he was using a palette, a color palette across his different scenes and you saw the color red across different scenes. I thought, okay, this is a way in which a movie makers excellent it uses cohesion. Now, I'm going to use cohesion. I'm going to create elements practicing something in my working memory until it becomes part of my procedural memory and I'm taking a technique of excellence from another field and trying to make my therapy a little bit more excellent by virtue of doing that. And, ah, this is me and Dr. Erickson around 1975. I look the same, right? So, uhm, this is about evocative communication. It's about implicit communication. And evocative communication is the purview of art. Art is not didactic. You don't go to the movies because you want to learn something didactically. You don't go to the theater, the art gallery. You don't read poetry or novels because you want to get information. You want to change your state. You want to change your mood. And so, that's why I use art as a model whereas previously my model has been Milton Erickson. Now my model has been looking at art trying to understand evocative elements in art and trying to improve my excellence as a psychotherapist by doing that. It's the reference experiences that we live that empower us. We all have reference experiences. We have reference experiences for knowing that we can be a good teacher. We have reference experiences for knowing that we're funny, reference experience for knowing that we're mature, that we're a man, that we're a woman. These reference experiences are seamless and they create our identity and part of our job as therapist is to create reference experiences that empower people and they're not only the foundation of our realizations they're really the foundations of our identity. 

00:17:20
The Imperative of Art: Art Communicates via Imperatives The recipient must intuit the hidden message: "What is being communicated?" 

00:17:25
JEFFREY ZEIG So, here's the problem, when you study art, when you study a movie you'll begin to understand the structural elements and I use movies because movies are the most complex art form that exist on the planet right now so they interest me the most because they bring together so many different arts. The artist can know the structure of what is being communicated but the recipient cannot. And I-- I'm not perfectly certain about this but I'm pretty sure so if you know the structure of the poem, if you know that the novelist is using a suspensive sentence that you're analyzing how this novelist created a suspensive sentence, eh, it, it roams the experience. The experience needs to be like a magic trip. The recipient cannot know the structure but the person who is communicating can strategically, intellectually know what that person is doing and parenthetically this was Milton Erickson. Milton Erickson was like that quote from Mark Twain, "Those can-- that can do it, do it and those who can't teach," and, ah, so he didn't ever explained what he did. It was hard to get him to sit down and analyze. There's a-- there's only a few examples and one of those is in the book that I added at teaching seminar where we spend five hours deconstructing a 50 minute induction and vI play the video for him and I ask them frame by frame what was his intention, what was he thinking and if he move his hand what did he expect? It was remarkable because I never saw anybody be able to understand their work at that level. I turned up the video tape at one moment and Dr. Erickson said about the patient. She's going to talk about her paralyze left arm. Her left arm was hypnotically paralyze. I said, "How could you remember that, that we-- the induction was done six months ago?" He said, "Replay it." So I replay the video and Dr. Erickson did this. He look to this hand and he moved it a few centimeters and he understood that this woman was so responsive that she was going to start talking about her hand because out of her peripheral vision she saw a cue that would alert her unconsciously to think about her hand. So, I-- I've never seen anybody in psychotherapy think like that. 

00:20:20
Art is designed to impact "states." We will return to the idea of "states." Art is about Expressive Impact Take for example, Joan Miro Mutation and Metamorphosis Joan Miro and Jan Steen Jan Steen 

00:20:20
JEFFREY ZEIG So art, art is designed to influence states. Art is about expressive impact. I wanna give you two examples I wrote. And, ah, this is a lot of content. I keep on looking at my watch because I really want to, to finish my message in the amount of time. This is, ah, example from the great Spanish artist Joan Miro. Miro went to Holland and study the art of the Dutch Master Jan Steen. And this Jan Steen and this, this is, ah, Dutch interiors and the painting is teaching the cat how to dance. And so, what you see is the dog and the woman with the replica of the Irish tin whistle-- no wonder I love that picture so much-- and you see the drunken people and they're teaching the cat how to dance and the boys is laughing raucously and a man is looking in the window and there's this musical instrument. Now, I'm sure that was radical art when Jan Steen painted it because you couldn't get paid for painting the Dutch tavern, you'll get pain-- paid by painting royalty. So I'm sure it was very controversial, very radical but when Joan Miro saw that he wanted to repaint it in his whimsical style. And this is Joan Miro's, ah, painting of Jan Steen. This is the same painting but what, what, what Jan Steen did was that he made it contain information and what Miro did is he took out the information to make the art purely evocative. It's the same painting except he didn't care about the man looking in and there's the musical instrument and this is the woman playing and that's the table cloth and the dog and the boy laughing raucously. So, you see the painting side by side and, ah, I saw this in the Metropolitan Museum when I was visiting New York and I thought it was brilliant and that somebody could understand that if you want to make something evocative you're going to sacrifice information and this going to be a kind of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, a reciprocal relationship if you make things really didactic you're going to sacrifice expressive elements and if you make things really expressive you're going to sacrifice didactic elements in favor of e-- expressive-- intend expressive effect. 

00:23:00
Emotional Impact! Emotional Impact. How Implicit Influence Elicits Emotional Response Experiential Moment Two Sopranos Excellence Improved Rossini's The Barber of Seville Cantata (Aria) Soprano 1 

00:23:05
JEFFREY ZEIG So my project is been about emotional impact and it's been about how the implicit influence is in elicits emotional responses. Oh, time being short but I'm gonna do it anyway. I'm going to play you an example of opera. I'm going to play you, Aria from Rossini from The Barber of Seville. These are two incredible sopranos. They are trained sopranos and the first one is absolutely excellent, stunning but the second has studied, uhm, bell canto opera and she knows what Rossini expect it of-- if his soprano. The first soprano sings exactly what Rossini wrote. The first one-- the second one does what Rossini expected. The first one is excellent, the second is excellence improved so if we have the sound we're going to listen to minute or two of each of them. I would invite you to close your eyes if you want to and feel the effect and know that the second one is doing some things that I can't understand but that her effect is going to be excellence improved compare to the first one. I want you to have the experience. Pray that it works. Aha! 

00:24:40
[non-English song] 

00:24:40
Rossini's The Barber of Seville Cantata (Aria) Soprano II 

00:26:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Incredible, huh? Second. 

00:26:20
[non-English song] 

00:26:20
Excellence Improved Whatever type of therapy you practice, you can add expressive elements to increase the impact. 

00:27:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Amazing! Well, I don't know what that second soprano did. I don't know the embellishments and I don't want to know the embellishments. I just want to be able to feel that that second soprano is not sinking the score. She is adding elaborations and she knows the elaborations that she's adding and that takes excellence and it makes excellence improve and whatever type that you're doing cognitive therapies, psychodynamic therapy, there are ways that we can use our palette to make excellence improve. 

00:27:55
The Structure is Invisible • The impact must be invisible to reach the heart. It is implicit. Part of our evolutionary socio-biology. • Consciousness is not necessary for emotional impact and response. • To reach the head, make it visible. • The artist can know the structure, the recipient should not want to experience, not to know cognitively. Therapy did not begin as an evocative art. But therapy can be an evocative art Revolutions in Therapy Commencing in 1885 • Psychoanalysis and Psychodynamic Approaches" Freud and his followers Post World War II • Behavioral Therapy: Wolpe • Humanistic Therapy: Rogers, and Perls. • Systemic Approaches: Bowen, Satir, Whitaker, Haley, and Minuchin. • Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: Beck and Ellis. • Experiential Approach: Erickson The Evolution of Therapy • Freud's emphasis on understanding "Why," which helped him develop a theory of personality. • Intervention, which came second to developing theory, was based in illumination the transference. It is based in a traditional (psychodynamic) lens, which presupposes that the problem is something other than its presentation, and that insight (into the transference) is the "royal road" to change. • Therapy as an evolution art 

00:28:00
JEFFREY ZEIG So the structure is invisible to the recipient but the artist can know about the structure. And, ah, therapy did not begin as an evocative art. It hasn't been cast as evocative art. Therapy is basically been more about understanding or more about psychoeducation and certainly there's places for understanding and there's places for psychoeducation but I cast psychotherapy as an evocative art. 

00:28:30
Hypnosis Evocative Communication BEING Experiential Hypnosis is essentially an experiential moment. What we know What we realize Experiences are a bridge between the land of knowing and the land of realizing 

00:28:30
JEFFREY ZEIG And hypnosis, well, it's not about information. When you're doing an induction you're not giving people information, you're creating an evocative experience, you're creating a reference experience, you can change your state and if you can change your state at once you can change it again. So hypnosis is always experiential it's not didactic. It's not about psychoeducation. What we know and what we realize is very different. We may know to exercise to be kind, to-- that we change our mood. Do we realize what we know? How can we bridge from the land of knowing to the land of realizing? What is the bridge between the land of knowing and the land of realizing? And it's the experiences that we live that bridge us from the land of knowing to the land of realizing. 

00:29:35
Ericksonian Hypnosis • Orients us to Phenomenology • Hypnosis is a strategic approach to change. • Practicing hypnosis changes ones orientation to psychotherapy. Deconstructing and Reconstructing Hypnosis, Therapy and the Therapist Important considerations: • Hypnosis is about altering phenomenology • Therapy is about altering phenomenology, in the structure of both the problem and the solution. • BEING the best therapist requires altering phenomenology Essential Characteristics of Hypnosis Hypnosis is a "state." Hypnosis is a syndrome; not and entity. It is a complex molecule, not a single element. Hypnosis is an interpersonal process. Hypnotic methods consists primarily of expressive, not informative communication. Hypnosis explores the possibilities for impact that are inherent in communication. By studying hypnosis we learn to BE the most effective communicators Hypotheses that Can Underlie Contemporary Therapy 1. Patients come to therapy because they want a change in "state," either that of themselves or that of others. 2. Hypnosis is a way of changing "states." 3. Hypnotic (heuristic) principles of changing states can be applied without the necessity of a formal induction to facilitate change. 4. To modify states by using heuristics we must first map the phenomenology of the problem and the solution. Additionally, it is best if the therapist can flexibly assume different "states." 

00:29:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And, ah, so, when you study about hypnosis it-- interest us in helping to some other human being to change their phenomenology, to change their live experience. And, ah, hypnosis is a state and I put the word state in quotation marks because very hard to define state except we move in transition in and out of mental state so quickly that we don't even recognize those states and hypnosis is not and entity. Hypnosis is a syndrome. It's something that changes over time and this is syndrome like Ménière's or fibromyalgia, it consist of a number of different, ah, elements that are combined over time in various ways and love can be considered similarly. It changes over time. The research in hypnosis that looks at hypnosis is in variant is just confusing to everybody both clinicians and to a researchers and to me, different from other experts in hypnosis. Hypnosis is an interpersonal relationship. It must be interpersonal. I'm not a believer in self-hypnosis. Self-hypnosis is not any different from meditation or relaxation training. Hypnosis must happen in an interpersonal field and its about expressive communication. What I'm doing when I do hypnosis is being like the second soprano. I, I know the words but I'm trying to take those words and I'm trying to add to them. And the good thing about hypnosis is that it explores the potentialities in, ah, human communication. And you know, Dan Siegel's model of the brain? Right, that this is the spinal cord and this is the cerebellum, your reptilian brain, blinking, breathing, digestion, the thumbs are the accelerator, the limbic system and, ah, the neocortex to break it's on top of it and if you know, the breaks were enough to stop people's impulses or in getting them into trouble then, we wouldn't have psychotherapist. So we need to have some way of reaching deeper into the brain not just giving people information in their pre-frontal cortex but have a way of reaching differ into their brain and so my thesis is that hypnosis is a way of changing state. It's a process by which we couldn't reach more deeply into the human brain tripartite division. 

00:32:15
"States" ✓ Emotions ✓ Moods ✓ "States" 

00:32:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Emotions. Emotions are fleeting adaptive experiences move toward move away visceral. That's Ekman's kind of definition summarize. Adaptive experience either you're gonna move towards or you're gonna move away because it's divisi-- visceral experience. Moods. Well, moods are calcified emotions. I mean, an exuberant mood, ah, I mean, a, ah, timid mood, they're calcified. Sometimes as patients come to us cuz they're lost in this calcified emotions. States. Well, that's mostly why our patients come to us. 

00:33:00
"States" "States" are a complex, emotions, moods, attitudes, beliefs, habits, memories, physiology, etc. "States" are "syndromes," not entities. 

00:33:00
JEFFREY ZEIG States are very difficult to define. I define hypnosis as a state but I put that into quotation marks because it's really hard to define states they're in amalgamation of beliefs and thoughts and feelings and relationship paterns and attitudes and historical understandings. 

00:33:20
"States" Connected Industrious Believable Open-Minded Liberal Considerate Honest Thoughtful One-up Attentive Respectful Engaged Forgiving Diplomatic Humility Authentic Imaginative Detached Lazy Deceptive Prejudiced Conservative Inconsiderate Deceptive Impulsive One-down inauthentic Disrespectful Disengaged Unforgiving Tactless Narcissism Phony Unimaginative 

00:33:20
JEFFREY ZEIG And so here's a list. This will eventually be a PowerPoint that you can have and these are more positive states on the left, your left and these are more negative states on the right and part of our job as therapist is the people come to us because they're lock into states. Being impulsive is not an emotion. We could say was a personality trait but I think about it as a state and if I want to help my patient to stop being impulsive into be more thoughtful I need to have a technology that helps my patient to change his state. 

00:34:00
Changing "states" requires a technology Being experiential, not didactic Imagine this Diagram is a Car. How to create influence traditionally: Thinking Behavior Affect Sensation "State" Physiology How to create influence systematically: Thinking behavior Physiology Affect Sensation "State" Context Experiential Impact Conscious Thinking Behavior Unconscious Physiology Affect Sensation "State" Context 

00:34:00
JEFFREY ZEIG And hypnosis is that kind of experiential technology. So, this is a car. And the front wheels are thinking at behavior and that's normal. In normal psychotherapy, we tried to help people to change their thinking and their behavior and we think that the back wheels affect and sen-- and physiology sensation state that these are going to come along if you change the thinking, if you change the behavior then the state is going is going to change. And so basically, we think about this as that thinking and behavior. Well, they're more consciously mediated and that affect state sensation, physiology, these are more unconscious. This by the way is a-- an evolution of an diagram from William Glazer but when we study family therapy we learn that context influences the car and if you make a change in the system you change the physiology, you change the state, you change the thinking pattern, we know that if you do family therapy-- structural family therapy with a diabetic child that is, ah, if the therapy is successful the blood sugar of the child changes by virtue of doing structural family therapy. 

00:35:20
"States" are influenced by evocative communication This is part of our evolutionary socio/biology Thesis • Impact should address sub cortical (subconscious) regions of the brain- I am sure. • Animals communicate experientially • So do movie makers, poets, novelists, artists, and so forth. 

00:35:20
JEFFREY ZEIG So states are influenced by evocative communication and this is part of our evolutionary socio/biology. And that impact should address the subcortical regions and I'm not perfectly sure about that but I do believe it and that animals-- well, by the way they communicate experientially. Dogs communicated experientially. Birds communi-- communicate experientially. Lizards communicate experientially and therapist can communicate experientially and our verbal symbolic communication is built on a subcortical layer, part of our socio evolutionary biology of how to communicate, uhm, and this is what movie makers do and poets, and novelists do. They communicate in a way that's more similar to our evolutionary biology.

Hypnosis as a "State." Some components The Goals of Trance Induction The Phenomenology of Hypnosis ATTENTION 1. Internal 2. Focused INTENSITY 3.More Vivid 4. Less Vivid ATTENTION 1. Internal 2. Focused DISSOCIATION 5. "Things Just Hapen." 6. "Apart from" & "A part of" 7. Destabilization 

00:36:20
JEFFREY ZEIG So what I'm trying to create hypnosis, I'm trying to illicit a kind of phenomenology. I'm trying to illicit five components. A change in people's attention. A change in people's in the intensity of your experience where it could be more or less vivid. Mrs. Smith, how do you know you're on the trance? My images were so vivid. Mr. Smith, how do you know you were on the trance? Time didn't just-- time evaporated. It just didn't seem to be there and so, when people report changes in attention or changes and to our changes in intensity where the report dissociative experiences they say, "I'm in a trance." 

00:37:05
The Phenomenology of Hypnosis INTENSITY 3. More Vivid 4. Less Vivid ATTENTION 1. Internal 2. Focused RESPONSE 8. Minimal Cues/Implication 9. Search for Personal Meaning DISSOCIATION 5. "Things Just Happens" 6. "Apart from" & "Apart of" 

00:37:05
JEFFREY ZEIG But one of the most important characteristics is that they start to respond and they respond to the implicit nature of communication. They respond to the psychological level of communication. They're not just responding to the social level of the communication. Every communication is info-- informative and evocative. If I say, "Here's a table and I'm a carpenter," you understand the evocative meaning of the communication different and if I say, "Here is a table and I'm a chef" or if I say, "Here is the table, I'm a-- I'm a mathematician." We are experts in evocative communication we have to use it. How can we apply it in psychotherapy? 

00:37:50
The Phenomenology of Hypnosis Define the situation as hypnosis INTENSITY 3. More Vivid 4. Less Vivid ATTENTION 1. Internal 2. Focused RESPONSE 8. Minimal Cues/Implication 9. Search for Personal Meaning DISSOCIATION 5. "Things Just Happen." 6. "Apart from" & "Apart of" 7. Destabilization Evocative Communication A necessity for impacting "states" Advanced Therapy To Increase the effect increase ADD ELABORATIONS TO MODIFY DENSITY 

00:37:50
JEFFREY ZEIG So part of the mix of understanding hypnosis as a social, psychological, contextual phenomena. You have to define the context, you have to-- have three psychological changes to some extent a change in intensity intense-- attention, dissociation and you need an interpersonal variable, a change in response. The hypnotic subject starts to respond to the implicit meaning of the hypnotist. And, ah, that if we want to advanced therapy we are going to add elaborations and we're going to modify the density of the communication and this is my essential message in this presentation is about increasing the density of communication as one way of adding the elaborations that can take simple ideas from the land of knowing and create realizations that our reference experiences for helping people to change their state and to change their identity. 

00:39:00
Traditional Therapy Advanced Therapy Compare and Contrast Traditional Therapy Historially Oriented to antecedents. The "roots" of the problem are in the history. 

00:39:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Now, in traditional psychotherapy it's oriented to antecedents. The roots of the problem is the history that's important. And so, as formative experiences that perhaps need to be reprocessed and understood and if we reprocess and understand formative experiences then we are extensively doing good therapy. 

00:39:25
Traditional Therapy 

00:39:25
JEFFREY ZEIG So traditional therapy has been oriented into the past and it's kind of to me too dimensional. 

00:39:35
Strategic Therapy Based in tasks Strategic Therapy 

00:39:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Now a strategic therapy, Erickson's therapy derived from hypnosis based in tasks. More dimensions added to it just, ah, very simple examples so that I can work with path for a moment time that we have left would be fine. And the an example is a man who came to Erickson-- so simple as to example I like to think of at the moment and he was board on wee. He's life was just not fulfilling. What had the man do? The man spent the day reading. He got up in the morning, he read. He had lunch, he read. He had dinner, read and his life was unfulfilling and he was consulting with Dr. Erickson. And Dr. Erickson said to him, no hypnosis. He said to him, "You know, I'm your physician, yes. And, I'm not just interested in your psychological well-being, no. I'm interested in your physical well-being, yes. And so, I can suggest to you that you could benefit for having some exercise, yes. Well, one of the things that you could do to have exercise is that you could go to the library, yes. The library is only a mile away so in the morning after breakfast, you could make your lunch and you could to the library. And by the way, you don't need to bring books because there's plenty of books at the library, yes." And so, the man follows Dr. Erickson's directive. He goes to the library just walking around trying to find things that are interesting, goes to the ornithology section. Finds an interest in birds. There's other people coming to he ornithology section. They stay interested in birds too. They start to have a discussion. Eventually, they form a social group. Soon, the man has a social life. He has change his orientation. His life becomes richer and there it seamless and it's not saying in a didactic way, you need to have a social life. It's establishing the contextual orientation that allows this evocative experience to happen. 

00:41:55
We can build on strategic methods. Erickson Example with weight control Or Library example Advanced Therapy To Increase the effect modify the DENSITY From Hypnosis we learn methods that can be applied in hypnotherapy trance I will demonstrate hypnosis. Think of how you can use these methods to empower YOUR therapy methods. 

00:42:00
JEFFREY ZEIG So we build on this, ah, strategic methods and to advanced therapy to add elaborations we can increase the density. And so, Pat can please come over here and, ah, allow me the, ah, honor of working with you and what we're going to do is to, ah, ah, do something a little artificial. I can't ask Pat to have a deep hypnotic experience at this moment. I don't want her to because I want to be able to talk back and forth with you but I'd like her to feel some of the evocative effect I'd like to demonstrate because I think talking about it, just isn't right. So let's uhm, see the-- what we can do, tell me something about you Pat, tell me something about your hobbies, your interests. Oh, and I know that this would help. 

00:43:00
PAT Ah, I have lots of hobbies. 

00:43:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. 

00:43:00
PAT I'm a photographer. 

00:43:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Oh boy! 

00:43:05
PAT And a painter. 

00:43:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Oh boy! 

00:43:05
PAT And, ah,-- 

00:43:05
JEFFREY ZEIG I'd been preaching to the choir. 

00:43:05
PAT Yes, apparently. 

00:43:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Aha, that's great. 

00:43:10
PAT Uhm. 

00:43:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And these things painting, photography they give you, you know, a rich personal satisfaction. The things that are not elective to you. These are things that are sustaining to you? 

00:43:30
PAT Yes, they are. 

00:43:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. 

00:43:30
PAT They bring beauty into my life in a very immediate way. 

00:43:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Right. Great. Okay, with just that little bit of information, do you know something about hypnosis? Have you ever experience trance before? 

00:43:45
PAT Yes. 

00:43:45
JEFFREY ZEIG You have and what it's like for you to go into trance? Oh yes, I do what it use to like. I'm so focused on you that I've forgot about the realities of the context, uhm-huh. 

00:44:00
PAT Uhm, what's it like to go into trance? It's a like a time is suspended. Everything is, uhm, uhm, more intense, brighter, uhm, ah, more immediate, more alive, more, ah, rich. 

00:44:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Fantastic. Okay. And then, ah, there's a way in which you orient yourself, a way in which you set your body and perhaps, ah, a way in which you can place your hands and your arms, set to your sitting and, ah, straight forward posture and then, you can take a deep breath and close your eyes and follow with another easy breath. And allow yourself to just settle in. Now, we need the slide too, please. So can I have, ah, both the picture and the slide. Yup. 

00:45:15
Personal Interests? Advancing Therapy I Attune 

00:45:15
JEFFREY ZEIG So one of the things that we want to do that can, ah, ow, it didn't work. And Pat you can just, ah, allow yourself to enjoy sitting here very quietly com-- com-- comfortably, peacefully in such a way that you can begin Pat to effortlessly look behind your eyes. And as you effortlessly look behind your eyes, you may begin to notice, notice different shapes, notice different colors, notice different patterns, in such a way that it an seen to you somehow, it can now seen to you as if, as if there's a kaleidoscope of shapes and colors that begin to appear easily, effortlessly before your eyes. And that can ring through in a way that's personally meaningful to you. Now, one of the things that I was doing was an elaboration that was creating attunement. This come so social psychology, it soci0al mimicry. So one of the simple things that I did to increase the density is that Pat had tilted her head to her right. And so, as we were talking and she was tilting her head to the right, I tilted my head to the left so that my head would be parallel to hers and we know from the social psychological research that this kind of attunement, this kind of social mimicry increases parentally feelings, increases responsiveness, increases, ah, a feeling of likeability and so, as I sat with Pat now in a way that seamless and that even we have to think about because it's part of my procedural memory I attuned myself to her and I want her to feel attunement in a way that was seamless, a way that was really unconscious. 

00:47:50
Advancing Therapy II Induction as a method/means 

00:47:55
JEFFREY ZEIG And this idea of that in this upright posture as you look behind your eyes that you can experience how effortlessly and experience how, experience how easily you maintain your head in that upright posture in such a way that you don't have to think about balance, you don't have to think about ease, you don't have to think about comfort. Your head is in the different ways, a different post-- position. Then, it was before that upright way. Now, if my induction is going to be about something for example ego building, a metaphor is for ego building is that if your head is on straight your feeling good about yourself and so, I want an element of my induction to have strategic valence. I'm thinking forward into the position, the induction is not just a means of getting people into trance, it's a method of how to do therapy and we as hypnotists do therapy within the realm of induction. 

00:49:30
Advancing Therapy III The Power of Precision 

00:49:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And there's another thing that can chime in, another realization and that is that as you look behind your eyes there gonna be an expands as you just let yourself setback easily. There can be as expands or shapes. There can be this expands of colors. There can be a kaleidoscope of shapes, of colors, of patterns and it can be so interesting, think about that. So interesting, yes to give yourself the life, to experience the changing patterns. Now, as an attunement variable as I'm talking with Pat I'm speaking as she exhales and I'm attuning my words to her breathing rhythm and that's another attunement strategy and one of the things that is most important in increasing density is precision. When I was with Milton Erickson I never felt so loved. It wasn't just me it was all of the other who visited him because he was so precise. Every word was surgical, the meaning of the words surgical, the gesture surgical, the meaning of the gesture surgical, the context surgical and that precision was so intrinsic, so loving that anyone would work so hard to be so precise to influence me and this is something that I attempt to do when I'm doing hypnosis I certainly don't have Erickson's genius or power but I can take an element and I have practice over and over when I'm doing inductions using the precision. 

00:51:50
Advancing Induction IV Tailor 

00:51:55
JEFFREY ZEIG And it can be as if your art of going into trance can be a way in which-- a way in which you can photograph the moment. A way in which you could just take a deep breath and realize the expansiveness of the art of how you can Pat realize, realize your trance compatibility. So if I know that Pat likes photography that she likes art, I'm gonna try to use art, I'm gonna try to use photography in some way. I'm going to tailor the therapy to the uniqueness of the individual when I did the first Erickson Congress in 1980 I ask Dr. Erickson for a quote for the brochure and he said, uhm, that psychotherapy needs to the tailored to the uniqueness of the individual and not to the procrustean bed of a hypothetical theory of human behavior and that was what he wanted as a primary quote that represented him. When he, ah, was 75-- Margaret Mead was 75. There will both born in 1901. They were friends and, ah, Dr. Erickson-- and what Margaret Mead wrote was that what Dr. Erickson did is he invented a new therapy for each patient. I think Freud added 13 cases to the literature and Erickson added 400 cases for the literature nobody added as many cases to the literature. Nobody will to add as many cases to the literature as Erickson and although some of the underlying principles or universals each therapy was unique, tailored to the uniqueness of the person. 

00:54:00
Advancing Induction V Advanced Language Forms Cumulative sentence with free modifiers, and Phatic phrases 

00:54:05
JEFFREY ZEIG And as you see it here effortlessly and as you can look behind your eyes and as you can notice the changes and as you do that you can just let yourself grow, grow, glow more easily and more comfortably into your trance and it can be delightful and you're here to learn about your experience of process of discovery. A process of intense involvement where you can just quizzically slow down gradually realizing more deeply slowly experiencing the art of how the moment changes. Growing more easily going more comfortably inside in a way that can help you to learn. Now, what I just did is I took something from novelists, ah, I created a suspensive sentence. I created a compound sentence with free modifiers cuz I could learn a technique about how to write a great sentence that novelist used which is creating a sentence and following, get what the series of phrases and those phrases would begin with the gerund, with an indirect object with an adverb and they are intensely hypnotic and that's what happens with your reading and so I just lifted the technique and I use the language form that was peculiar to the novelist but at hypnotic valence. I use a cumulative sentence with free modifiers and, ah, somewhat of phatic phrase. 

00:56:50
Advancing Therapy VI Utilize 

00:56:55
JEFFREY ZEIG And this idea of utilization, the most profound, the most key concept in an Ericksonian approach so when I talk about chiming in and when I talk about rhythms I'm trying to use the sound effects that are happening that you hear in the auditorium and trying to take those things and weave them into the experience of patch trance. Now when you read aren-- any of Erickson's cases their all studies in utilization, utilizing the patient's metaphor. One of the classic, simple one-liners in Ericksonian lore is the patient who is in the hospital and he is knows that he's Jesus Christ and he's trying to convert everybody to Christianity and being quite a nuisance and nothing changes him and so, they give the patient to Erickson and he walks up to the man psychotic as he was with his delusion of being empowered in the situation where he was powerless, omnipotent in a situation where he was powerless and the patient, ah, and Dr. Erickson goes up to the patient as sir. "Yes, my son?" "Sir, I have an unders-- I understand that you have experience as a carpenter." "Of course, my son." "Can you help us?" "Certainly, my son." "Can you help us in the woodworking shop?" "Of course, my son." And Dr. Erickson leads the man down to the woodworking shop and the apocryphal end of that story is that the man becomes a carpenter at the hospital but he uses the metaphor. 

00:58:35
Advancing Therapy VII Use Available Output Channels Using Gestures Emotions are communicated with gestures! 

00:58:40
JEFFREY ZEIG And that even though Pat has her eyes close, you see me gesturing, you see me moving, you see using space and if I we-- if I had to do it over again I would be smiling more when I was doing the induction with Pat and I would be using as many output channels as possible trying to be more excellent focusing myself to have impact on her experience and, ah, it's been re-- as-- kind of a-- amazing that we don't learn to use even something to just simple as gestures so when I'm doing hypnosis even though the patient has, has her eyes close if I'm talking about an expensive moment I'm using a gesture in that expense of moment cuz if you called the Erickson Foundation and Kelly answers and your calling from Europe and she says, "Erickson Foundation." You hear it, you feel it as compared to saying, "Erickson Foundation." So we respond to these kind of subtleties. 

00:59:55
Advancing Induction VIII Build Implicit Responsiveness 

01:00:00
JEFFREY ZEIG And the way of with ease the way in which you can take an easy breath and allow yourself to really let go so that you can feel yourself in this moment moving forward. Allowing yourself to seam as if your effortlessly moving forward, heading forward into trance and I'm trying to learn will Pat respond to the evocative nature of that communication and will she respond to the meaning of what I'm talking about. 

01:01:05
Advancing Induction IX Modulate Tension Slope of Traditional Induction Slope of Ericksonian Induction 

01:01:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And there ways in which you can begin to envision yourself groc-- lo-- clori-- growi-- going even more deeply into trance and this is unusual using moments of destabilization, moments of tension like Beethoven when doing a symphony whereas traditional hypnosis, waaah, and in Ericksonian induction yeah, wam-wam-ah-uhm-ha-pa-pa-uhm-pom-uhm, and, and, ah, modulating different levels of tension as the person goes into trance. 

01:01:50
Advancing Induction X Destabilize 

01:01:55
JEFFREY ZEIG And your conscious mind can understand while your unconscious mind has its own way to really understand and the kind of conscious understanding that you consciously understand are different from the kind of unconscious understandings that you unconsciously understand but the kind of conscious understandings that you understand unconsciously can be different from the kind of unconscious understandings that you curiously understand unconsciously but you can't really understand until you with your eyes close just look up to the top of your head, take an easy breath and really let yourself envision more easily, more deeply, more intensely, the comfort of trance. Now that is completely bizarre communication and using a destabilizing technique and following that with the suggestion, a concrete suggestion and, ah, people don't like uncertainties states and so, when you create a little bit of uncertainty people are more likely to jump on to the next thing that comes along that makes sense. 

01:03:25
Advancing Induction XI SIFT: The process of suggestion What Makes Therapy Advanced? Multilevel Communication 

01:03:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And there's ways to yes understand and ways to experience and ways to realize. How pleasant it can be to now see that ray of changing shapes experience the depth from the colors and this is something that you do, this is something that you do just for you and this is communicating in a tripartite way how you setup, how you intervene, how you follow through setup, setup, setup, intervene, follow through. Communication is a process. It's not staccato, it's not seems like you're feeling good today. It's your hear, you're listening, your understanding and you're feeling good and it's something that really helps you to know more about yourself. Communicating in a sequence how to pre-suggest, suggest, post-suggest, how to enter, offer, exit and these are techniques that I learn from artist and I start to incorporate them into the warp and woof of my hypnosis and then I start to increase-- increasingly use those things in my therapy and Pat thank you so much. Thank you so much for helping and realizing and learning something about, learning something about your abilities, your capacities, learning something about your part of trance comfort and then in a moment I'm going to ask you to begin to reorient yourself, begin to bring yourself back, that's right. You can bring yourself back very easily can-- comfortably take one, take one or two or three easy breaths, just take one or two or three easy breath and breath yourself back refresh and energetic and wide awake, I-- aha, oh, I'm sure that was a little unusually taxing because of going back and forth but what it was like for you? 

01:06:20
PAT Well, I would, I would get very peaceful and 01:06:25]relax and into the colors in the scene and things and then this used to be... 

01:06:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm-huh. 

01:06:30
PAT Coming out. 

01:06:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Probable-- yeah. 

01:06:30
PAT That's very jarring and kind of like what's this. 

01:06:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. And so, you're momentarily jarred and then what happened? 

01:06:40
PAT And then I would see what would happen and kinda go back into a-- yeah, a relax state and then, what expecting curious, wandering what's kind of happening next. 

01:06:50
What Makes Therapy Advanced? DENSITY Thanks!!! 

01:06:50
JEFFREY ZEIG You have been great and we thank Pat for her cooperation. I'll take the slide one more time. Thank you so much, yes. Okay, so simply speaking what makes therapy advanced, what makes therapy advanced is this. What makes therapy advanced is when we can increase the density of the message and, ah, that-- this is what I'm passionate about, how can we do things that increase the density that make simple ideas that are already exist in the land of knowing, we experientially realize and I think that as we learn to take things from art, to study art, to look at the structure of art, we begin to find elements we can use, to ah, make our interventions no matter what school of therapy we do, we ha-- we, we profess to more powerful. So that's, ah, my heartfelt message for you. Thank you so much. Dr. Don. 

01:08:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Have a seat. Uhm, before I get to respond to this, ah, one presentation, ah, I have to ask your key question. Do you know Hava Nagila? Can you play Hava Nagila when I'm done? 

01:08:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Oh, I wish I could. 

01:08:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM All right, well keep working on it. 

01:08:30
JEFFREY ZEIG I could do Amazing Grace. 

01:08:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM No, I want Hava Nagila. Well, anyway, uhm, please join me and a heartfelt thanks not only for this presentation but for Jeff's setting up the evolution of psychotherapy conference with his volunteers and with his remarkable staff, okay. Okay, don't lean in to my time, it's the-- that way now. This is my fifth participation in this conference and I have come to characterize the conference I see them before they die. I do-- I don't wanna be morbid but when he invites me I get my cholesterol level check. I figured he know something that I don't know, okay and I'll give you one very quick anecdote in the homage to a previous evolutions conference. He know he ask his convocation at the beginning, you know, when he gets all these people and that wanted this convocations Albert Ellis who is no longer with us, Aaron Beck and myself were walking through to get to the arena this triumphant of cognitive therapist and he always has some pictures like he has the cards now usually silhouettes of people and Ellis in his amiable style if you remember him. Look at these and said, "What the fuck is that?" Well, it's kinda logical, little stuck and back look at the two of us and said, "Don't look it's bad luck." Now, I really have a lot to say about this presentation but the problem is that my I'm stuck behind my eyeballs and I'm only seeing colors, okay. Now, there are three things that I really want to address in one minute time. One is Jeff has highlighted a key feature that makes therapist effective whether indeed you're doing hypnotic induction as he's so talented in doing or whether in fact, you're trying to boast there these therapeutic alliance and I spend a lot time in my presentation in supervision to have people appreciate the non-verbal and strategic ways they need to use their body, their voices and the like and the degree to which Jeff highlights, ah, the, the variety of verbal and non-verbal kinds of features that makes social influence effective I think we all can learn from. Ah, so, so that-- that's one of for-- and you don't have to be into hypnosis, uhm, I you know, I, ah, I had a colleague with me named Ken Bowers who is really being on research in hypnosis and he came out and visited with Milton Erickson and in fact , Ken Bowers and I did a book called The Unconscious reconsidered. Uhm, that's out of press by Wiley but we actually explored whether there's a concept you know, there was a gra-- a professor and I said, "If Freud came back today what would his concept of the unconscious be given everything that has transpired since his death," and, and, and there's a lot of controversy. A, both about the nature of unconscious, you know, what is it mean to be unconscious versus conscious. There's a lot of controversy about the nature of hypnosis. Is it the state or it just a social persuasion you know, is it Ted Barber or is it Milton Erickson. Okay, you said just getting Pat to respond to you know, suggestions and there's a lot in literature says yes that is just as a persuasive technique that's could be attune all to state, okay, and that is one qualifications for how you do it but does an unders-- lie the-- I undermine, I should say the nature of the potential influence. So one of the things that's really nice in-- interesting better than nice is impressive is the way in which Jeff uses his voice you know, the way in which he calls this thing density knowing that, how the hell you get a program that goes bing, bing, bing, bing. I'm a, I'm a-- I mean, I mean that's-- so one of the things that becomes really kind of interesting is the way in which he picks up on her breathing. The way in which he uses language you know, if I had difficulty sleeping-- okay, I have four broken ribs they are-- I played tennis, I've full grown, I'm taking Jeff with me to just say effortlessly, okay. "Don, I want you to lie there effortlessly," and if he said that four times he would take away my pain unless I sneeze which would have ruin the whole thing. No, but the, the first message is we have a lot to learn as a field from this kind of social influence process, that's the first kind of it. Let me then move to the sopranos, okay, cuz that's really an another interesting issue cuz it has to do with what is the nature of excellence or what we called expertise and in fact we did a, a, a lot of work on what makes or experts children in school. You know, what smart kids gets smarter and other kids fall the further and further behind and one of the things we did in the book for nurturing independent learning is I reviewed all the literature on experts. So there's not only a literature on experts singers but there's extras chess players which is Jeff's place, bridge place, gold place diagnosticians you know, there's a, there's a whole literature on expert radars. Okay, you were going to, ah, a restaurant with someone writes down nothing and they bring back and dish out everything as compared to the waiter who comes back and he goes, "Flanking someone order a flanking at the table, raise your hand now, okay!" So, one of the things that we now know what constitutes experts and one of the things that's interesting that Jeff is highlighting is we know that experts no a lot more than novices or experience non-experts and that the knowledge that they have is organized and highly retrievable and now I did they have a lot of declarative knowledge like he says that this second woman knew about Rossinian what he intended that she had structure. She has a lot of procedural knowledge. She knows how to embellish and moreover that's what made her so impressive and upper pole of what the work that goes on in this area, you do not get to be an expert at anything unless you engage in what Erickson's called-- this is the end of that Erickson calls deliberate practice and it most likely took our more than 10,000 hours to get that level. So, so what this is have to do with psychotherapy cuz I trained people to become more expert so that means that if you are going to become an expert you need to have a lot of knowledge, about various forms of psychopathology, you need to have a lot of knowledge that's procedural in nature. So, if you have a woman who is clinically depress and suicidal like the one I showed, you need to know that they're maybe a significant other in their life like a husband or a partner, okay, who is high critical, high emotional and that there's a lot of marital distress. You need to know that if you get marital distress that you need the stress conflict tactic skill to see if there's domestic violence. You need to know that if she is the press that you need to have risk and protect the factors. You need to know a whole series that makes you an expert, okay, and you need to translate that in the last piece that I wanna make address is that is what's the difference between knowing and realizing, okay. So, so the first point that I, I wanna highlight that I say Jeff, this serves a lot of credit on has to with raising our awareness about the role of verbal and non-verbal cues and how we make request and social influence with or without inductions. The field we clearly benefit from that. The second thing that he's highlighting whether he use the art or, or other metaphors for this is the degree to what characterizes excellence or expertise and in terms of knowledge, procedural knowledge, deliberate practice and alike and how this translates into the therapeutic activity. So, ah, you, you can't become that second soprano unless you have a good deal of knowledge about musicality, about how to embellish, okay. You can't do this induction thing unless you're gonna get a lot of deliberate practice and as he says need to have a model who you could then emulate. Let's take the last item and he has-- at-- I mean, this is a wide ranging kind of presentation that deserves, ah, more attention than a 15 minutes I have. There has to do once we deemed between knowing and realizing and one of the things we know is that giving people information is insufficient to change behavior. So the key question is how do you access that knowledge and how do you get them to come up with the idea that somewhat my therapeutic best when the coins I see at one step of having me offering the suggestion I would otherwise to offer, okay, and there's a whole set of tools that you could use to art of questioning in, in prompting, in cueing and the like but the difference between knowing and realizing that means by me by realizing means that you actually put it into action that you change it means that you cannot just train and hope as a therapist. You can't just do an induction with Pat and think she is going to want and change her life, okay. From my perspective, the one of the thing that was wonderful when I, I use to read Erickson, okay, and it's a great set of case studies and, and you see these unbelievable manipulations. You like the one with you know, the guy who think he's Jesus and so forth, a sense of down to the woodwork, okay. Now, from my average and not only that the next page it always works. I never had any failures in Erickson's case studies. I mean, if I said this guy down to the woodwork, they would say, "We don't wanna any kind of crazy here." This guy would bang his head, split nail open, okay, not it always things at this law jamming that Erickson we talk about you know, has the potential go over and help this woman water her flowers. Okay, go to the, you know, so what happens is Erickson was brilliant in setting the contextual basis where it would permit these other things to happen but in all honesty if we try that, there's a hard probability it would fail or maybe that's why it had it adequate, okay, but you should least be open to the possibility that these maneuvers do not work. To get from knowing to realizing you need to incorporate in your therapy all the literature we know on generalization. You cannot just train and hope, not just doing induction and think people will spontaneously employ this. If the guy who is going to the library has poor social skills, okay, hugs all the books, is intrusive with other people tries to make advances on this ornithologist wife who's there, okay. Okay, "Hey, you have a great chime, I think, Can we go together?" Okay, okay, so one of the things that becomes interesting is this the whole role for what interventions you go into provide so that he could access and use that social network and one of the things that becomes really interest and this gets the last point and that is we know to get generalization that I've written about. I have a 357 page handout, that's part of this conference but we are as different as psychologist that you could imagine. The fact that I though I come on and play music, okay, and blow in tool pipe, okay, and I can get away with that, I figured I would never get invited again to an evolution to psychotherapy conference. I'm gonna get invited back, okay, right, I just want issue, okay. So, but one of the things we now know is that we have a set of guidelines to get from knowing to realizing. So you need to have a good therapeutic alliance, you gonna have collaborative goal setting, you gonna make sure that people have skills in their repertoire that you train at the metacognitive executive level and most importantly and if you need generalization, you need to have people in a consultative mode. They're gonna take ownership of the skill and they have to explain back to you, this is where we different which would be really interesting debate, they have to explain back to you what it is they got to out their treatment take credit for and then talk about how they're going to use this in your day to day experience, what barriers they might have, what self-efficacy. So when you get to my hand out you will see an entirely different approach cuz we put-- keep in a consultative mode, okay. So, so imagine for instance that you are working on your computer and you get stuck and you go to someone for help. Now, some of the people you go to may know a lot about computers but they're not very good teachers so you finally find someone who is really quite good in knowing about computers and helping you. Now, they help you and you're about to leave and you say to them, "Don't go anywhere. Put your ass right down here. I know that when you leave here, okay, I'm gonna loose the whole goddamn thing, I'm gonna screw up the program. And so, so let me walk you through what it is that I just learned, okay." Okay, so you need to put into either verbal, behavioral or teaching mode that you do not own that skill and can apply it until you've gone through that step and we've done a lot of research on teaching kids, to teach other kids to be in a helping mode and that, that is an important element to get generalization. Now, this is an empirical question. Empirical question is what I'm arguing correct or could Erickson have told me to go walk a mile, find a computer group and join them and spontaneously someone would see my inadequacies, okay and as a result to that I would become part of the social network. So, since I have four broken ribs and I can't walk a mile, I have a wife and home who helps me with my computer and not only that I have a mentor who you all can learn from. Thank for your contributions. If you want a little religion and spiritually, stick around it's the Sabbath. 

01:25:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, so we only have-- I only have a moment to react back and, ah, I-- 

01:25:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM I didn't know you had that option. 

01:25:05
JEFFREY ZEIG I do especially as the organizer and, ah, you know, I was listening this morning as telling Don at breakfast that I was listening to him doing a clinical demonstration in the Orlando Brief Therapy Conference a number of years back, part of the way that I education myself is that I get the tapes from all, all of the conferences and for this conference it will take me six months to go through all of these tapes and to learn everything that I can and what Don was doing in this particular demonstration is he was asking questions and he was exploring one facet of how you could do therapy by asking questions in the most interesting way and I'm you know, listening to this and I'm you know, trying to understand his art and his structure and does he ask questions what kind of questions and how does he formulate them and how does he present them and it was beautiful, it was artistic, it was that 10,000 hours of expertise. And so, okay, great, well, I've got Don Meichenbaum now I'm picking something that he did this excellent and then, I was watching him and I-- is you know, humor and how he does this incredible one-liners and he modulates his voice when he's doing that, I'm thinking okay, well, ah, how can I take something over here and how can I use that when I'm doing teaching and so, this idea of modeling excellence, I you know, just something that now becomes endemic to me and I want to do it. Now, the only thing that I would disagree with is, ah, the point-- the only point of contention would be about explaining back, you know, there some things that need to be explain back like, like computers but if you asks somebody, you know, can you explain back why you love me? Well, you can't do that, it just doesn't work. So when the experience is an evocative emotional experience explain back doesn't have the same valence to me as when it is technical in experience and that's when I want to have the explain back experience but, ah, I think that you know, life is so much charming its live and modeling expertise is something that can be dangerous to the experet because if you ask the expert a modeling question, you know, if I say it on how specifically will using humor and how specifically your constructing that and suddenly I make him really consciously aware of all of the facets I think he would lose some of the impact of his humor. I would gain but he would lose because I have demonstrated this you know, in some of the workshops that I do so it's in-- it really, ah, interesting process and my, my regret is that we don't have more time to go back and forth and to really explore, uhm, some of the areas where we have profound agreement because we, we don't have much disagreement except perhaps for that one, one area. So we don't have any more time we really need to-- 

01:28:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Do I get a rebuttal? 

01:28:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. I'm your organizer. 

01:28:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM I'm very strategic in humor. I had its planned out in terms of which story, when to tell it. 

01:28:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm-mm. 

01:28:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And as you're doing it I'm trying to figure, give me my limit of time when one example from. So I can, you know, and I'm, I'm very as I showed demonstrated my work and presentation a remarkable deliberate. I come out at the therapy sessions very tired. 

01:28:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Absolutely. 

01:28:55
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And I figure out what the pluck, when to pluck when am I doing things like that and I think all of these kinds of skills are teachable. 

01:29:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Yup. 

01:29:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM You know, I, I, you know, I, I think or I wouldn't be in this business and you know, I, I wish we had more time maybe, I got an idea in four years. 

01:29:10
JEFFREY ZEIG It's a promise. 

01:29:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Let's continue that in discussion. 

01:29:15
JEFFREY ZEIG It's a promise. Thank you so much. Thank you.
