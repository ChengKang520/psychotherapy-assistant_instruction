TRIANGLE PRODUCTIONS Presents LEARNING & TEACHING THERAPY with JAY HALEY a film series by JAY HALEY and MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY 

00:00:35
JAY HALEY This is one of the series of training films on learning and teaching therapy. It is unique perhaps and that the clients are not shown nor are they heard. This is for reasons of confidentiality and the protection of privacy. What is presided is the planning and carrying out of therapy by a supervisor and a training group. It shows a supervisor at work and the trainees expanding their ideas and skills hopefully. The goal is to change therapists as well as to change clients since they must learn on how to change people in distress. The films offer valuable material for discussion since ideas differ about how to do therapy and how to train. The therapy being taught is brief and problem-focused and the trainees have not been taught the particular approach. The supervision is live with the trainees watching from behind a one-way mirror and taking turns going in to do therapy. Suggestions from the supervisor to the therapist are sent to a computer monitor in the therapy room. The therapist can see the messages said on the monitor but the clients cannot. 

00:01:45
The Boy Who Can't Stop Fighting 

00:01:50
JAY HALEY The therapist had been seeing this case in individual interviews for a year. She brought the family in for a brief family consultation, because of dissatisfaction with the lack of improvement of the fighting boy. The first step in starting a case is to formulate the presenting problem as we all know. The problem should be in the present, not in the past. It should include what colleagues as well as what family members are involved. It should consider interventions previously tried. 

00:02:25
Ah… It’s another boy that fights. He can't stop fighting. He cries and he wants to stop but can’t seem to stop. He’s driven. We have had him in therapy for a long time. 

00:02:35
(Inaudible ). 

00:02:39
And we’ve… Yeah, well, hey you know. 

00:02:40
Mike Tyson! 

00:02:40
JAY HALEY Does he win the fights? 

00:02:40
Yes he does. But he also doesn’t get… You know, he doesn’t stay in any school very long, he keeps getting bumped out of schools. So he’s a little African-American kid and has a twin brother who doesn’t fight, but they watch wrestling pretty much around the clock. Ah… 

00:03:00
JAY HALEY (inaudible ). 

00:03:01
Yeah, and now we’ve… you know we’ve taken him out of the last school and put him in this class where there’s a bunch of other kids just like him, and they’re understaffed. They have one teacher to eight of these wild kids, and they… they pounce on the teacher. So, they have been through eight teachers in this class this year. 

00:03:25
JAY HALEY One for each kid you mean? 

00:03:25
Yeah, well, they get frightened, they leave, they quit, because this class is so unruly. And they don’t have enough funds, I guess, to have enough aides to handle the class. I don't know. But we thought that this would solve the problem and it's not. He's continuing to get suspended. His mother works, and he’s home alone when he’s suspended. He is a very nice kind of depressed kid. Ah… We put him on antidepressants, that didn’t seem to work, so we were looking at doing Ritalin. He is not ADHD but Ritalin has been shown to do something for aggression to help reduce aggression. And since we’ve done so much else, and it’s not working… I’ve had the family in once before. And there are, the boys, it’s the two twins and then an older brother, ah… and they were… didn’t like talking about the personal business at all, you know, balance of up and down, I'm on the stir, it’s Springer(ph) show, you know I like this. And… But mom wants to get them all together and try the family route again. Mom works full-time, step-dad works in the mornings. He only has one arm. So… And he's kind of… She describes him as kind of a dependent personality. He doesn’t drive. Ah… She takes care of him. 

00:04:45
JAY HALEY It’s not hard to drive with one arm. 

00:04:45
Well, hard but not possible. He gets worried that he'll get lost and he seems to be very dependent on her. 

00:04:55
JAY HALEY The presence of a stepfather brings the possibility of the integration of a stepfather approach. This can be a new stepfather or one in the family for years. In this case, it has been eight years. If the stepfather is inadequate or ailing in some way, he might be focused upon for improvement with the problem person. In this case he is depressed and handicapped with one arm. The fact that mother talks about throwing him out makes his presence more relevant. 

00:05:25
His father died when he was two. And he ah… had lots of issues around that - not really knowing the identity of who dad was, and not feeling connected to the stepfather. Dad was murdered, I think. The males in this family die by the age of 25 for the most part. And so part of his issues when he came in, very depressed was, it doesn’t matter anyway, I’m not gonna live anyway. 

00:05:55
JAY HALEY The fact that all the men in the family were murdered must influence the boy. 

00:06:00
The last session ah… I said, are we expecting too much from you? You know, if what's going… what’s going on inside, are you incapable of not doing this? And again he started to cry, and he said, I can’t help it. So, I don’t know. So, what… 

00:06:25
JAY HALEY What's your hypothesis? 

00:06:25
Well, my… Well, it seems to me that he’s acting out the family's anger. The family has a lot of racial stuff and they have a lot of ah… an eye for an eye, you done me wrong, you know mom buys into this and she starts defending him from the school bus driver and… and you know they did this to… He has gotten rewarded for this kind of behavior, because they did him wrong type thing, and so I've been working with her on that and the twin. I've had the twin in, and I've worked with the twin a little bit. Ah… 

00:07:00
JAY HALEY The twin behaves himself, right? 

00:07:05
The twin holds it together at school. They’re in different schools. When they were in the same school, then they fought with other kids - they would gang up on other kids. 

00:07:10
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:07:10
And she moved them out of there into another home of her sister’s, which they hate. It’s an all white neighborhood. But at least she was worried that… was gonna get killed by somebody’s older brother, you know, for beating up on these little kids at school all the time. And that is a real danger. 

00:07:30
Well, that his mother in the structure and what she expects from them? Because I don't… I don't agree. Do you Frederick(ph), about it being cultural that there is no structure in the home? Is it… Some of the friends I have who are African-American, boy you better listen to mom or you’re gonna get it, you know. It’s pretty… 

00:07:45
JAY HALEY They have a hierarchy there. 

00:07:45
Ah? 

00:07:50
JAY HALEY There is a hierarchy, you know usually in there. 

00:07:50
Yeah! 

00:07:50
JAY HALEY Yeah! 

00:07:50
So, I'm wondering why she's not owning(ph) some structure. 

00:07:55
The sense of something other than a… an empty hose, which is what he felt like to me. And so we resurrected this dead uncle, and made him kind of the guardian angel along with dad. You know, we had all these dead relatives helping… and then… found out that this uncle had been gay and just… He just lost it, and then he was really upset. But the other twin is larger, he’s healthier looking, he was born second to… both premature. Ah… So… doesn’t have the impulse-control that his brother has. 

00:08:35
JAY HALEY I don’t care for the hypothesis. 

00:08:35
Okay! 

00:08:35
JAY HALEY That he’s expressing the anger toward the family. 

00:08:40
Okay! 

00:08:40
JAY HALEY I… I wouldn’t know where to go with that. I would assume that ah… he’s helping somebody by the misbehavior. 

00:08:50
Protection Theory is Described 

00:08:55
JAY HALEY And that person who he’s helping should be the one who helps him get over it. Because as he gets over it, if that person isn't needed the kid would get over it. But anyhow, it sounds to me like he’s very involved with his mother and that he helps his mother by giving her something to think about, besides her misery with her husband. I’m not saying this is true but it’s a hypothesis… 

00:09:25
Yeah! 

00:09:25
JAY HALEY …that you can emerge(ph) with. 

00:09:25
Yeah! 

00:09:25
JAY HALEY I would also think that if he fights like that, that he should be in a karate class, that he should be in a disciplined place where he can fight. If the mother would go along with that. 

00:09:40
They've done that. 

00:09:40
JAY HALEY To him? 

00:09:40
And he doesn't like the structure. And mom said he just wasn’t able to keep up with the different moves and so he dropped out. Ah… 

00:09:50
JAY HALEY Everybody behaves like he’s serving a function of some kind. 

00:09:55
Right! And that is serving a function. It’s keeping them from having to… to deal with their stuff. He doesn't (inaudible ) and that is a protection function. 

00:10:05
JAY HALEY Is that the only thing he does? 

00:10:05
That's the only thing he does. 

00:10:10
JAY HALEY That's good! 

00:10:10
And he’s obsessed with it. He says that he sits in his desk, and if somebody bumps him or trips him, he'll for the next several minutes visualize what it’s… the fight that he could get in with them. He works it out all in his head. And I said, then do you act on it? And he said, no, not always. And I said, does it come out the way you imagined? Sometimes! He loves it. You know, he… and then he goes home and watches wrestling. And he’s not a mean, vicious kid. He’s not vindictive… I mean, he’s vindictive, but he's not… he’s a very gentle soul. When you see him in there, he cries and he’s a very gentle soul. So, I wonder if he's here. 

00:10:50
JAY HALEY The boy can express a range from temper tantrums to weeping. This range influences the therapist. Part of the problem is that improvement doesn’t stabilize. 

00:11:00
JAY HALEY Usually, what it sounds like, is a stepfather who never got integrated into the family. 

00:11:10
Okay! 

00:11:10
JAY HALEY And he is on the perimeter, and one of the ways you usually integrate him is by putting him in charge of something and having the mother support him instead of negating him. 

00:11:20
Integrating stepfather by giving him authority 

00:11:20
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:20
JAY HALEY And your… your task is to introduce him as a… as a biological father, really – to get him to act that way. And whether you’re good with this one, I don’t know. I’d hesitate about it, if she was just about to kick him out. It doesn’t sound like you can integrate him in. 

00:11:35
I know. 

00:11:35
JAY HALEY But he should be either in or out, they should think. 

00:11:40
Yeah! And I was gonna take her aside before the session and find out the status on that, because I did try to do that at the beginning when I… The first time I finally got him in, I got him in for one session, and ah… he never came back. I tried to get him to take him fishing just to… go out fishing because the stepfather loved to fish. 

00:12:05
Yeah! What does the stepfather do with the other kids as… that he is not doing with…? I mean, do they get along? Do they… 

00:12:15
Yeah! Well, mother says that they do get along and that the other boys have accepted him and look to him as dad. 

00:12:25
JAY HALEY Apparently, you know the mother hasn’t quite accepted him in some area. 

00:12:25
Hmm… 

00:12:25
Yeah! 

00:12:30
Well, I think, yeah. I think that is true. 

00:12:30
JAY HALEY And therefore the boy represents that? 

00:12:35
Could be! Could be! 

00:12:35
JAY HALEY Is there a… Is there is a wrestling bout held in this area? 

00:12:40
Well, not at all. 

00:12:45
JAY HALEY Well, not on TV. 

00:12:45
Yes, they just had a… You mean regular… like the wrestling he watches? They just had a big ah… convention. He… It feels like an addiction. You know I work with drug and alcohol, and he’s like, he cries and has remorse and he… he can’t control his thoughts, he thinks about it all the time. I mean, I look at him and say, you need rehab! Yeah! 

00:13:05
Wrestling rehab? 

00:13:05
Yeah! I think wrestling. So many of the kids that I work with that have violent problems are wrestling fanatics. It’s a very bad thing for these boys. So, I mean… 

00:13:20
JAY HALEY It’s a very exciting thing if they go to it. 

00:13:25
If she was successful getting him off a bit I wouldn't want to do that. But if she was unsuccessful then. 

00:13:35
JAY HALEY Well, it's just you need something for the stepfather to do… 

00:13:35
Yeah! 

00:13:35
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:13:35
JAY HALEY …that gives him some interest and authority in the home. 

00:13:40
That’s if he staying. 

00:13:40
JAY HALEY In the search for something positive in a problem person, some ability or a talent or a helpful behavior is useful. In this case what the boy loves is wrestling. The adults don’t approve. 

00:13:55
JAY HALEY So when they come what are you gonna do? 

00:14:00
I don’t know. What should I do? Ah… 

00:14:05
JAY HALEY I’d start with the mother first. 

00:14:05
Ah… Okay! I’ll start with the mom first, ask her the status of dad. And ah… 

00:14:10
JAY HALEY Well, he’s halfway. And then one of her problems is if she is accepting him or not. 

00:14:20
She probably has some reason why she couldn’t do it right then. 

00:14:25
JAY HALEY And you go to get the others, come out for a few minutes and we’ll discuss what do you like. 

00:14:30
Okay! Ah… Okay! What was I gonna do? I was gonna push on the boys to find out what they think about what’s going on with… and what have they done about it? What they… What they think it is? 

00:14:40
JAY HALEY I would start with what changes do they want. 

00:14:45
What changes do they want from the family? 

00:14:50
JAY HALEY From the family. 

00:14:50
Okay! 

00:14:50
JAY HALEY You know, one possibility is that twins complicate everything. One possibility would be to getting the twin who’s behaving himself to stop behaving himself and take the place of his brother for his sake to see if he can get in a fight or be hostile. You could get them talking about what… does and what does other twin do. 

00:15:15
A Most Ingenious Paradox 

00:15:20
JAY HALEY I mean, Twin A shouldn’t carry the load. The other guy should carry some of it. So, could he begin to misbehave the way his brother does. 

00:15:30
But then… stop because his brother is been there done that too? 

00:15:35
JAY HALEY Well, he'll have to stop, because where this thing has to go. 

00:15:35
Okay! 

00:15:40
JAY HALEY They’re passing it back and forth. Or you may, if you decide to, I don’t know the kids involved, one of the other people might replace him. 

00:15:50
…high-functioning 13-year-old, I’d like to see him to do something here. 

00:15:55
JAY HALEY Well then, you could get him to take over. 

00:16:00
Oh yeah! 

00:16:00
JAY HALEY More than just fighting, getting mother upset, he’s bringing her into therapy. 

00:16:05
She might, you know, she… it threatens her job, the livelihood. 

00:16:10
JAY HALEY Sure! 

00:16:10
JAY HALEY A summary of the interventions already tried were 1. Move to another neighborhood. 2. Suspend the fighter from school and place him in a special school. 3. Individual therapy, and with the mother at times. 4. Get(ph) to imagine resurrecting dead relatives. 5. Place the boy in a karate class. 6. Object to boys watching wrestling. And give the boy various medications. The therapist begins by seeing the mother alone to find out if she wishes to maintain the marriage. The mother says she feels sorry for the stepfather. 

00:16:55
So, I guess, I wanted to ask, if you wanted me to pull him into things? I think he’s kind of pivotal in what’s going on. If he’s gonna to… If you are gonna to have him around, but if you are… I mean are you interested in couple’s counseling? 

00:17:10
OBSERVING THE FIRST LIVE INTERVIEW 

00:17:15
I’d like to get him more involved in what’s going on, but I don’t wanna pull something in that's unstable. Do you know how you’re feeling about it? Do you think you’re having a hard time because you feel bad for him? 

00:17:35
Bad, yeah! 

00:17:35
This thing, he sends(ph) me things, observations and stuff to say, so if you see me looking at this and then saying something then… 

00:17:45
Okay! 

00:17:45
And I think you’re… You know we’ve been doing this stuff for a long time. We need to do something different. 

00:17:55
JAY HALEY What… What would she like her husband to do with the boys? 

00:18:00
[sil.] 

00:18:20
For confidentiality reasons video and sound have been obscured 

00:18:20
JAY HALEY The twins and older brother are brought in. Stepfather did not come. The plan was to assist mother. 

00:18:30
…doing here. They’re watching us there. And then you might see, we're looking at this sometimes (inaudible ) to say on that, okay. (Inaudible ). 

00:18:45
No, I don’t see it. 

00:18:50
JAY HALEY Therapist acknowledges an expert presence behind the mirror. 

00:18:50
Here we are. Why are we here today? 

00:19:00
Ah… I think this is it. This is a pretty strong family. 

00:19:10
[sil.] 

00:19:10
…tells you what needs to done and you guys do it? 

00:19:15
[sil.] 

00:19:40
So did you guys ever change places? One bad guy and another one is a good guy and then again the other one is the bad guy? No! 

00:19:50
I don't think so. 

00:19:50
How is it? What are you guys now? Do you ever get fights… 

00:20:00
JAY HALEY Maybe the older brother could have a bad week, next week. 

00:20:05
I know that he's wanting to do it. 

00:20:10
He changed places with you? 

00:20:15
[sil.] 

00:20:15
(Inaudible ) if you’ve changed places with me. And you won’t be fighter anymore. I mean… would have a bad week next week? Would that help you? 

00:20:30
No! 

00:20:30
No? 

00:20:35
He doesn't know how. You don’t know how to be bad. 

00:20:40
JAY HALEY The bad twin says he is embarrassed because older brother takes a beaten boy home and apologizes to the family for what he did to the victim. This is what a father might do. An older brother here replaces him in the hierarchy. 

00:21:00
JAY HALEY What they can do (inaudible ). What if one of them is bad? 

00:21:10
I think it’s time for you to give it up. I think your brothers… What do your brothers think about you? So… 

00:21:25
JAY HALEY In response to the suggestion that someone do a bad act, the good twin was mad by turning off the microphone. The fighter would not let him take over and be bad. He then came up to the microphone to do something bad. 

00:21:40
Can you show him you wanna be bad? 

00:21:45
No! 

00:21:45
He’ll have to show you, because you don’t know. What would you have to do to get him to be bad? You wouldn’t know how? Which one was the most bad with the microphone? 

00:22:05
Because I touched the mike. 

00:22:10
Do you usually have to teach him how? 

00:22:15
JAY HALEY Well, one of them I don't know, you got the name. 

00:22:15
Could you practice being bad? What would you have to do to get him to be bad? 

00:22:20
Are you okay? 

00:22:25
[sil.] 

00:22:40
JAY HALEY For hierarchical reasons, mother should be in charge of the children in general and of this paradox. 

00:22:45
[sil.] 

00:22:50
What did we just do? Who’s in charge here? 

00:22:55
(Inaudible ). 

00:22:56
He's not going to have to be bad. 

00:23:00
Oh no! 

00:23:00
But in this family somebody has to be bad, so you know what? Who’s going to be bad for the next week and you are giving that up for one week. And I guess what? He’s going to be it and you're going to have to teach him. 

00:23:10
JAY HALEY If he's a bad boy being good, he will be punished for not doing what he should, which means he will be punished for being good. 

00:23:25
And I asked mom as we were leaving, I said, they’re like this at home? And she said, oh yeah! 

00:23:30
JAY HALEY You did very well. 

00:23:30
You think so? 

00:23:30
DISCUSSING THE FIRST LIVE INTERVIEW 

00:23:30
JAY HALEY I know it’s a complex interview. 

00:23:30
Yeah! 

00:23:35
Yeah! That was not… I didn’t know where I was, what I was doing. But… 

00:23:40
JAY HALEY If the good boy is bad you can really punish him the next time. 

00:23:45
Yeah! But they said a lot of other things that were good for me to know, I felt. Ah… It just brought out that one of them has to be bad. 

00:23:55
JAY HALEY Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:55
You know, I had heard the… 

00:24:00
JAY HALEY And they said it’s a sacrifice. 

00:24:00
Yeah! And I… They were talking about the embarrassment thing, that he’s too embarrassed to not fight, that's always been the personal issue of his. But if can bring in the system and force out the embarrassment through, you know, it was good. That was… That was good to bring that part out. And mom, you see how she just kind of advocates. She just… 

00:24:25
JAY HALEY She sits and admires those boys. That’s what she does. 

00:24:30
Yeah! 

00:24:35
JAY HALEY I think we should have brought father into it sooner, or wove him through it or something, because he's really been left out of everything now. 

00:24:40
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:24:40
JAY HALEY I mean, they will go back and having joke about this and so on and he… he won't even know what they're talking about. 

00:24:45
After the boys beat somebody up… apologizes to him. 

00:24:50
JAY HALEY No! 

00:24:50
And did you hear that? 

00:24:55
JAY HALEY I didn’t hear that. 

00:24:55
And I said, wow! Well may be you could do that. No that embarrasses me. He always walks out and takes them back to their house or… and apologizes and sees if they're okay. 

00:25:05
JAY HALEY Interesting! And beat him up and take him home, and he nursed, right? 

00:25:10
So somebody needs to be the good guy and somebody needs to be the bad guy. So, they don't usually do that with kids, but I'm more nervous in this situation, I think. 

00:25:20
JAY HALEY Did you think it was the boy said he would have to be bad and then he went over to the microphone, and you think that was related, that that was a bad act he was demonstrating? 

00:25:35
Oh! Well, I think the other twins are really bad, he just was better at it. You know. 

00:25:40
JAY HALEY He's secretly bad. 

00:25:40
Yeah! He's just smarter. Ah… And I don't know… for tomorrow. You heard that! So, he's… They're like crossing their fingers and then shaking my hand and… 

00:25:55
JAY HALEY It would have been nice to have the time to have him teach his brother of the setup by (inaudible ). 

00:26:01
Yeah! I thought about something like that. Is there anything else you saw in that that I was kind of overwhelmed with the whole thing? But… 

00:26:10
JAY HALEY You kept to see (inaudible ). 

00:26:16
Yeah! 

00:26:16
JAY HALEY No, I thought it was a (inaudible ). Anybody else would have done it differently? 

00:26:21
Well, (inaudible ). 

00:26:26
JAY HALEY That’s right, he was recommending that. 

00:26:30
Ah… Two devils? 

00:26:30
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:26:30
Well, you got, practically have two devils. 

00:26:30
Yeah, I mean… 

00:26:30
(Inaudible ). 

00:26:35
We got excited for a while about it. 

00:26:35
Oh Lord! 

00:26:35
JAY HALEY Yeah! You know, usually when you do this, you have a mother who gets indignant saying, you mean you want my child to be bad. 

00:26:45
I thought she would! 

00:26:45
JAY HALEY And she had no reaction like that. It was all a game. 

00:26:45
She even volunteered to be bad then she… 

00:26:50
JAY HALEY That’s right! 

00:26:50
Well, then she confessed. Did you hear the confession? She said, I didn’t tell you what I did to a coworker today. And I went, what! I said, so, we’re all bad in this family. Raise your hand who… I said, raise your hand anybody who’s bad in this family. And they all did. 

00:27:05
Moving around. It’s like when you asked… get out of the chair and sit between them, they were kind of flip-flopping back and forth and that how I actually wanted(ph). 

00:27:15
JAY HALEY But when they're in the same school, it’s so hard for them to individuate at all. 

00:27:20
Exactly! 

00:27:25
JAY HALEY Why did she do that, do you know? 

00:27:25
Because they fight. They would ah… They became a dynamic duo. After everyday at school the two of them would go back and beat up whoever had done something wrong to somebody. 

00:27:40
JAY HALEY (inaudible ) problem and parents go to different extremes. I mean, help them individually by giving them different clothes. And others, just dress him alike and teach them alike and they develop a private language in their home. It’s ah… We had a pair of twins that they even had twin girls… boyfriends… no girlfriends. 

00:28:05
Oh god! 

00:28:05
JAY HALEY They had a (inaudible ) they were working together. They got the same grades. They did everything. And the parents had always been so pleased, because they were so cute, you know. But this mother doesn’t seem to treat them. She doesn't hit one if the other misbehaves. They must have a hierarchy, if they can do chores. 

00:28:25
Yeah! 

00:28:30
They never had before. They never… This is the first time. 

00:28:30
JAY HALEY Well, let’s be creative on that now. 

00:28:30
Yeah! That's right! 

00:28:35
JAY HALEY Because somebody has to say you have to do this or you have to do that or it’s time to clean or she won’t let us go if we don't clean up. 

00:28:40
And she was surprised that they did it. I mean, did you hear her say, aren't you surprised? I'm surprised! She said, yeah. 

00:28:50
JAY HALEY Forty-hour week and coming home and cooking and cleaning and organizing. 

00:28:50
She's having them do nothing, nothing. 

00:28:55
JAY HALEY Because he was angry that the fact that somebody else was gonna have to be bad. His whole expression was, this is inappropriate. 

00:29:00
This isn’t fair. That makes me worse. And I would rather be the fair than the worst. Yeah! 

00:29:10
But often you can have kids to pass the symptoms. And what it does was, I’ve seen most of the kids, they water to cleanse it out. This becomes a much more minor symptom when… when they have to do it and they have to do it at certain time and they… they have to do because the brother agreed not to do it. It works out a hierarchy among the family members. But usually you get indignant parents. You mean, you’re telling my kid to steel again? 

00:29:45
Were you expecting that? Were you expecting the mom to… 

00:29:45
JAY HALEY I thought she get indignant and say, he’s making enough trouble, you don’t wanna make him do more. But she got right into the (inaudible ). 

00:29:53
Yeah! 

00:29:55
JAY HALEY I think it’s partly in your manner was cheerful about it and she picked them up. 

00:29:55
Oh really! Also… But she was glad that they were talking, I think, so that’s why she jumped in. She said, well these are talking. 

00:30:00
JAY HALEY That right! 

00:30:05
Yeah, she did say it. 

00:30:05
JAY HALEY She must have been. When they came in they were so quiet, she must have been concerned of that. 

00:30:10
Oh! Well I was concerned. I was, oh my god! So… No when… came in the first several sessions were of me looking at him. I mean, he… he wouldn’t speak. It’s not that… We can do this (inaudible ). But I liked this. I mean, it's hard in front of everybody to… I would have… I was conscious of that. Ah… 

00:30:35
Everybody (inaudible ). 

00:30:38
You guys! 

00:30:40
Oh! 

00:30:40
Ah… 

00:30:40
We’re glad we weren’t in there with you. 

00:30:40
But I like the family, because I can jump into it and really get into it. I like that rather than working just with the… the kid. And… 

00:30:50
It’s something very natural, right? 

00:30:50
Yeah, yeah! 

00:30:55
JAY HALEY But in that way if you think this family, it could have been good if you just sat there and said nothing. But it was a… 

00:31:00
But that’s what I was worried about. Hmm… 

00:31:05
JAY HALEY To bring him out and get him that active is not… is not accidental (inaudible ). 

00:31:08
I always sit down on the floor with him and you know play cards and do the sand tray thing and stuff and… Yeah, it’s attention that they haven’t… And I… They have my full attention for an hour. 

00:31:20
JAY HALEY They’re also letting to play. 

00:31:20
Right! 

00:31:20
JAY HALEY Playing with metaphors. 

00:31:25
Right, right! So, you’re right. And then I… 

00:31:25
JAY HALEY One of the great studies of Bateson was whether animals know that play is play. And they have to differentiate between a bite of combat and a bite of play. And every once in a while they don’t differentiate and they bite each other and get… get into a battle. But he was interested in the fact that you have to be able to communicate at two levels in order to play, you have to indicate this is a bite of play… 

00:31:55
Alright! 

00:31:55
JAY HALEY …and not a bite of combat. And I think kids must have to learn that. 

00:32:00
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:32:00
JAY HALEY They learn how to establish a… a relationship and then begin to play within the relationship. 

00:32:05
Oh yeah, that was exhausting, that was good! Well, thanks for your input. And I… Yeah, I'd like to bring them back. And… …gonna be here. 

00:32:15
Alright! 

00:32:20
Ah… 

00:32:20
Oh we’re gonna bring that sense of a beat up the bigger brother and make him the bad person? 

00:32:25
PLANNNING THE SECOND LIVE INTERVIEW 

00:32:25
Yeah! We’ll see if they follow the rollover switch. 

00:32:30
JAY HALEY Sure! 

00:32:30
I don’t think they did. 

00:32:35
JAY HALEY Why you heard this… the boy did something wrong? 

00:32:35
No! I haven’t talked him at all. 

00:32:40
JAY HALEY Well, he… he shouldn’t have done anything wrong and his brother should have. 

00:32:40
Well, the next day he had a fight that he was going, he was supposed to attend. Ah… 

00:32:50
JAY HALEY To be in or attend? 

00:32:50
Be in! 

00:32:50
Any follow through? 

00:32:50
I don’t know, we'll see. 

00:32:55
JAY HALEY We’ll find out. 

00:32:55
He's a planner, he plans! 

00:32:55
Oh yeah! 

00:32:55
Why? 

00:33:00
JAY HALEY Who are you gonna see first? 

00:33:00
Ah… I was planning to see them all. 

00:33:05
JAY HALEY I would start with the father. 

00:33:05
Okay! And? 

00:33:10
JAY HALEY And… Because he… he doesn’t know what everybody has been saying about him and he hasn’t had equal time, if ah… if he's really part of the family. What… What's his position now? 

00:33:25
Ah… I don’t know, it’s pretty shaky. Remember I told… I talked to her about, she was going to kick him out, but she hasn’t done it yet, because she feels sorry for him and she doesn’t know too well and she's real wishy-washy. So, I said, well do you want me to pull him into this? I mean, you need to let me know which way you want me to go? And ah… she asked him to come. So, that… 

00:33:50
JAY HALEY I would… I would treat him like a biological father and… 

00:33:55
Yeah! 

00:33:55
JAY HALEY …and have him alone. Just say to him you want to talk to him a few minutes alone to explain what you been doing with the family. Because ah… he's… he's down at the bottom at the moment. 

00:34:10
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:34:10
JAY HALEY And spends his time sleeping instead of doing anything. 

00:34:15
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:34:15
JAY HALEY And to ignore him, would put him down further or to just make some mingle(ph) with the crowd. If we give him special treatment, he has a fair chance of getting some authority in the family. 

00:34:25
Okay! 

00:34:25
JAY HALEY But I would keep it to ah… what's his understanding about the boy fighting and what’s has he tried to do and then what he thinks how the family is doing. 

00:34:40
Yeah, okay! 

00:34:40
JAY HALEY But it shouldn’t be more than five minutes. 

00:34:40
Okay! I just wanna ask a question. 

00:34:45
JAY HALEY Then when you bring him in, you gotto say to the boy, did you do what you're supposed to do? 

00:34:50
Oh, what happens when he says no? 

00:34:50
JAY HALEY Then just say how could this be possible? I am very disappointed in you, you know. Yeah! And then you say to the… to the brother who was supposed to be bad - if you’d have been bad enough, he would have been able to be good, and blame him for not being bad enough. If you want to play with this, that’s what I mean, you know. And ultimately, you blame the mother and say perhaps she… she could have done something about this. 

00:35:20
Tell her to supervise it. 

00:35:20
JAY HALEY And get the boy to be bad and the other boy to be good. You might… You might tell the… the father that that’s been part of what was planned, so he isn’t just bewildered by it. 

00:35:35
Right! What about ah… I'm still getting the sense that the family is supporting him in this behavior. They outwardly don’t think it’s okay, but inwardly they have a lot of rage. They have a lot of anger. And they’d love to smack somebody beside the head, because they looked at him wrong, you know. I… How do I get them to acknowledge that that they're really feeding this? This is just a very sensitive not very bright kid. 

00:36:15
JAY HALEY I wouldn't. 

00:36:15
But that's what’s the heart of it. Okay! 

00:36:20
JAY HALEY No, that maybe the heart of it, but I… I wouldn't ah… educate them about it. 

00:36:25
Okay! So, how do I mobilize them to change that support of that? How can I do without them knowing they're supporting it? 

00:36:35
JAY HALEY When you can’t… Once you’ve given him… Once you’ve expressed your disappointment, although you might not have but the kid may have been behaving, okay this week, then you have to worry whether it happens accidentally or not. 

00:36:45
Well, when he does that… 

00:36:45
JAY HALEY Yeah! 

00:36:45
…and he gets better from it (inaudible ) and he… 

00:36:51
JAY HALEY That’s right! So, I would end it there if it’s appropriate to have the bad one, the now bad one do what go another week bad. 

00:37:00
Okay! 

00:37:00
JAY HALEY Because he hasn’t had enough yet. 

00:37:05
So how do I rally the family? How do I get the family to do something about this? Because that’s the only thing I can’t do it. He's not gonna do it on his own. 

00:37:15
JAY HALEY You’re talking now about him hitting a kid out in the street. 

00:37:15
Or daily if he had his chores. 

00:37:20
JAY HALEY But not in… 

00:37:25
It’s pride. He said I don’t wanna be a wimp. It’s… It’s better to hit than to feel like, you know, he's embarrassed. 

00:37:30
Like his dad! 

00:37:30
He's like dead-set(ph) against making this change that we're asking him to make. So the only way he's gonna make it is that if he gets extreme pressure from the family and he's not getting that. 

00:37:40
JAY HALEY Well, maybe… maybe he can from the father. I'd give him a try. 

00:37:50
The father is… is (inaudible ). 

00:37:55
JAY HALEY What you could do is, is get the family coordinated, if you see him alone first… 

00:38:00
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:38:00
JAY HALEY …then you see the whole family and there is where you… for his sake you outline what’s… what the plan was last week. 

00:38:05
Okay! 

00:38:05
JAY HALEY So he learns it there and that gives him some authority, because he's respected enough to be told what happened, you know. But you’re trying to empower him in life to stop the way they're handling the boy. And ah… it’s an empowering parent’s problem, when… when they're divided to the point of almost splitting up, which is hard. 

00:38:30
So, just kind of support their getting together and agreeing on something and doing something. 

00:38:40
JAY HALEY And you can have them all explain whether they should be taking turns not being bad. 

00:38:45
Instead of why does somebody have to be bad. 

00:38:50
JAY HALEY If somebody… Somebody has to suffer by being bad. But I'm trying to think of how to phrase it for them. But it… it started last week. One… One of the ways after you see the whole thing is to ask what happened this week? Or did it work this week? And see if they even remember, you know. 

00:39:10
They don’t remember. 

00:39:15
JAY HALEY They might. 

00:39:15
Ah… How weak he is, because of his disability. He won’t drive, he's afraid. I asked them to take him fishing and, oh I’d get lost! 

00:39:25
JAY HALEY Well, you know, if you think about how to handle them, if he complains to you, depending on your relationship with him, you can say it’s really important now not that you complain but that you do something, ‘cos this boy is really getting hurt out there, you know. He's getting bigger. 

00:39:40
Right! 

00:39:40
JAY HALEY But I would be a little firm with him, that’s what I mean, from the way you described him. 

00:39:45
Maybe he'll be totally different, you know, that’s my one session, (inaudible ) this guy was Hercules. 

00:39:51
JAY HALEY Anybody want to bet whether the boy was good this week? 

00:39:55
I don’t think he was good. 

00:39:55
JAY HALEY I think he was. 

00:39:55
You think so? 

00:39:55
JAY HALEY Yeah! 

00:40:00
He'll do anything you ask him to do. 

00:40:00
No, he tried it. He wants to make me happy, but he can’t. 

00:40:05
(inaudible ) follow through, even that fight, I don’t think he was bad. He got enough fight. He did what you wanted to do. His temptation was (inaudible ). So I'll bet… I'll bet… I'll bet against. 

00:40:15
You have the energy for this tonight? 

00:40:15
JAY HALEY Well, they'll give you the energy I think. 

00:40:20
The family did not appear for their appointment 

00:40:25
JAY HALEY In this consultation a variety of interventions were made. One was to interview the whole family, not just the individuals. Two was to integrate stepfather into the family by giving him some authority. Three was to get stepfather to take the boys to a wrestling match, a live one, which is their favorite show on TV. Previous therapists opposed such wrestling. Number four, rather than resurrect father and uncles, he should visit the grave and acknowledge them gone. Number five, propose a paradox to let the boys take turns being bad. This paradox requires a bad boy, a good boy, and a peacemaker with authority. The good boy is asked by the therapist to do something bad, because the bad boy is overloaded with being bad. The good boy goes and fools with the microphone being bad, and so he has been good as he should. When the bad boy sees the good boy being bad, he also goes and fools with the microphone to be bad, not wanting the good boy to be bad alone, since he, the bad boy, is accustomed to being bad. So the bad boy is not obeying. The good boy is obeying by being bad. If the good boy is being good, he will be punished for not doing what he should, which means he will be punished for being good. This is a type A paradox. A type B paradox is when the therapist tells a client, disobey me, he disobeys whether he obeys or not. Type C paradox is when the therapist asks the client to resist when the client is already doing so. The therapist saw the fighting boy and his mother in one final session. After that they were not in therapy. The brothers did not successfully trade places, but they talked and giggled about it for some time that week, as if they had discovered play and not combat. They began to recognize that they encouraged one another to escalate the violence. The fist fighting was reduced and became more verbal rather than physical. Mom said that things were better. Stepfather was more integrated into the family and we’ve suggested took the boys to a wrestling match. The boys’ relationship with dad improved, and they treated him with more respect. The mother focused on her career, where she was promoted.
