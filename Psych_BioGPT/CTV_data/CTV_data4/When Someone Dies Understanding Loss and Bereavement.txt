"Do Not Stand At My Grave And Weep" 

00:00:55
Mary Elizabeth Frye 1905-2004 

00:00:55
UNKNOWN Do not stand at my grave and weep. I am not there. I do not sleep. I am a 1,000 winds that blow. I am the diamond glints on snow. I am the sun on ripened grain. I am the gentle autumn rain. When you awaken in the morning's hush I am the swift uplifting rush, of quiet birds encircled flight. I am the soft stars that shine at night. Do not stand at my grave and cry. I am not there. I did not die.

Jan Mojsa - Psychotherapist 

00:01:45
JAN MOJSA This film is about loss. About the loss when somebody dies. Now why make a film about what happens when somebody dies. Well I guess it's often at that time when we can feel so – so ill-equipped and ill prepared in order to – to even support others, let alone even begin to – to deal with ourselves. Or maybe it's also because at those times it is so intensively private, and deeply personal that it can be hard to begin to find the words to describe the experience. And I guess it's no surprise then that we often turn to poets and to poetry in order to give words that begin to describe the feelings that are – that aren't deeply unique to us. And yet somehow it's common to us all.

00:03:05
JAN MOJSA In this film we'll hear from three people. Who tell us what it's like to lose someone they love. We'll understand through their experience the grieve, and loss and what it was like for them to go through their own veil of darkness. And using their wisdom we can maybe begin to find helpful ways beginning to deal with our own experiences of loss and grieve. And also how to yet, sit alongside another person as they experience their sorrow. First we'll hear from Mary. Mary began telling me about John, her husband. Who died of an epileptic fit, aged 42. 

00:04:05
MARY PRIEST-COBERN You know, initially, when it first happens you're in absolute shock. And, um, I just remember when John did die um, I was working, um, for a newspaper. I was – I was – it was bank holiday. And, um, I was on the early morning shift. And, um, I had, um – and about six – or about five o'clock in the morning John had a seizure. I – because he suffered from epilepsy. And, um, so it was a regular occurrence. But he didn't have them – well he at least one a month probably. And he was on meds for it. And the usual process if he had seizure, you know, you kind of – you know, you turned him over. And then he would just sleep it off. And, um, I – you know, so I was – you know, that happened. He had a seizure. You know, turn over, make – sit with him for awhile. Car waiting outside. Have to go to work. Um, bank holiday. Nobody's in, hardly. Didn't think he was going to die. Going back to the feelings of loss and actually to engage with the feelings of loss I have to engage with the moment of my loss. And when I engage with the moment of my loss I engage with the scenario that happened, uh, that day. And, you know, I engage with, um, the fact that I did – you know, I left him. And I got in the car and I went to work. And then I – I woke up my son and said, you know, um, check him out in a half an hour. And it was about seven o'clock I went to work. And I rang at eight o'clock. And, you know, he didn't check him. And he was asleep and he woke up and he went in and he was unconscious. And they called the ambulance. And I had to leave work. And, um, yeah, and I just had to – I just remember the panic of trying to get to the hospital before he died. 

00:06:35
JAN MOJSA So – so I guess there's something about engaging with – with what was an ordinary day. But then became extraordinary. And I'm just noticing both the panic and the shock. 

00:06:50
MARY PRIEST-COBERN And the anger too. Like, why did he die. Why did he die. He was only 42. And then the guilt kicked in. Because I couldn't save him. And, um, then you just kind of, you know, I just can see him still there dead. And in that place you just have to pause and just kind of know that it all, um, it's part of life. You know, it's part of life. It's part of life. And you have to just hold it. And you never forget it. Because you can – when you tell the story you journey back to that moment in time. Which is still in the fabric of who you are. It's still part of your story. And, you know, it's – it's a powerful story. Because it shows me so much about, um, who I am. And it tell – shows me about, um, you know, uh, intimate loving relationship is you know, so much a physical thing. But it's, you know, that kind of heart world doesn't leave when the person leaves. And that's – you know, that's actually, um, helped me to know that he's safe wherever he is. And that wherever he is in the world or in heaven, or in the cosmos, somewhere, his spirit is still with me. Because it's – it's carried in love. And, um, the journey of loss and – and there's so much around loss because you know, it's like, we've got loss and we've got gain, you know. We've got loss is bad. And gain is good. And it's like sitting with – well this is bad. But it – it's like really I've had to sit with that it's – it is. It's part of being living. It's part of being human is that you experience loss. And intellectually and philosophically, you can think one thing. But in your feelings you have to just kind of sit with them and you have to be in them. And you have to go the rollercoaster of that. And it is a rollercoaster, grief, bereavement, loss. And you try to fill your days with other things, you know, to, uh, but yeah. You get home from work and they're not there. You know. There's like a big empty space. And you try to fill that space. And you – you're too scared. You – you're just – there's nothing that will fill that space. So you have to sit with the space. And sit in the space. And let it be. Bless him. He had a wicked sense of humor. A really soulful person. He had bad health for a long time, so you know, in some ways it was a real relief for him to take off. You know, because the body wasn't well. Bless him. 

00:11:15
[sil.] 

00:11:20
MARY PRIEST-COBERN Actually he's free, you know. It's like – he's okay. It's not him. It's like, you know, it's picking up the pieces. It's like getting on, you know. Chopping wood, carrying water kind of stuff, you know. It's just like picking up and carrying on with a big vacant space in your life. Because, you know, when you're together with somebody they – you kind of merge. You become one, you know, you just have a life that's – that's shared. And then when this – when it's gone then it's – it's like realigning yourself. And, um, it's okay. It's okay. And I'm feeling better now. Because I know that everything is actually okay. And I feel like I've had to kind of journey into a part of myself that these feelings are still contained. But they're – when I go to that moment in time it's like I'm not – that moment in time is still real. You know, and I started going for long walks you know. And I just felt like I just wanted to be on the earth. And I just – and I work in the garden, you know. You just really want to connect with the earth when that happens. And listen to music. But – and I couldn't actually look at a picture of John for ages. Couldn't have any pictures around because the pictures were too painful. 

00:12:55
[sil.] 

00:13:00
MARY PRIEST-COBERN So I planted a tree for him. A bush actually. Honesty. He's an honest person. So I thought oh, I should just – I've still got some seeds here actually, at the garden. So I planned a – I planned honesty. I thought, yes, he likes it. He was simple, you know. And then I had two weeks off work and I had to get back to work. And actually that was good. It was actually really good to, let's carry on with life. Let's do, you know – let's do. It's, you know, everybody gave me a bit of space. And it's kind of awkward, you know, because, you know, people want to help you but they don't know how. And it's, oh, it's difficult. But, you know, weekends were the worse or weekends I wasn't working were the worst. Nighttimes were more difficult. But, uh, yeah, the strategy is you just keep busy. And you sit with the feelings. And time heals them. It's like, it takes time. You can't force it. You got to – and you never get over it as we've seen in my journey today. Because it's 14 years. It's long time. But, you never get over that moment as, you know, I never realized the emotions that are still behind telling the story. But in the same time, the distance, the time distance actually helps you to, um, learn to live with the feelings.

JAN MOJSA Mary describes her loss as a rollercoaster. And as you watch you can see her move in and out of – of touch with her thoughts and feelings as she recalls the dreadful events of John's death. And the way she managed her grief in the months and years afterwards. In the chaos and madness of the rollercoaster, there is a shape and pattern that we can draw on. And that tells us something about the passage of mourning. But let's first look at what Mary tells us. First, she describes the actual moments leading up to John's death. She has total recall of the events. And notice that she remembers the exact time that she left the house. And the time of her phone call. Such total recall is characteristic of trauma. Mary is traumatized by what happened. She describes the shock and the disbelief. The unreality of the reality of his death. And as she tells us about what happened she experiences the feelings as if they are now, with absolute immediacy. Ancient teachings say that death is inevitable. And that loss is inevitable. But this never prepares us for the shock of when someone dies. Mary describes all sorts of feelings at different times. She speaks of her feelings of guilt, of anger, sadness, emptiness, confusion, loneliness and pain. At the beginnings she's deeply in touch with these feels. She describes how she physically coped day to day. Grinding through each hour. Coping with the mundane. Going to work. The business of surviving. And later as she continues to talk and remember, it is as if she's able to view what happened to her from a greater distance. And as she does this, the intensity of those immediately felt feelings lessens. And then that gives way to her struggle to find meaning in her experience. And finally to find a place to be with her loss. And to reflect on her new identity. Many theorists have studied the passage of grieve. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross worked with dying patients, and their families for many, many years. And she identified some common themes, both for those who were dying and for those coping with the loss of a loved one. Although our understanding of loss has moved on considerably from this early work, much of the substance remains helpful in understanding what happens in grief. The whole idea of their being stages of grief which a person experiences has given way to a more fluid sense of moving between different moods and moments. But whatever the pattern of this journey it is likely that some of these elements will be present at different times. One, shock, denial and isolation, especially at the beginning. Two, anger both at the world and at the dead person for leaving. Three, bargaining. A sort of please let not this be true and I will be a much better person. Fourthly, depression. Prolonged low blank moods and overwhelming sadness. Fifthly, and finally acceptance. Finding a way to be with the loss. It seems that although every single person's experience of death is different, there are shared themes and patterns which are a part of the journey of grief. Sometimes it helps to see this visually as the loss curve. We can hear the echoes of all of these themes in Mary's story. When Mary lost John, her experience of his death was not like anybody else's experience. Because we're all unique. And bring all our life history and the history of that relationship to that moment. But death itself cannot be escaped. And in that there is something about our shared humanity which means we are not alone.

Bill Hawkins - Counsellor 

00:19:45
BILL HAWKINS Perhaps it would help if I was to tell you a story that the Buddha once told. It involved a woman by the name of Goat Tommy Tissa. She was not a very good looking woman. In fact she was from a poor family and she was rather skinny. And her husband's family really did look down upon her because of this. But as fortune would have it, one day she gave birth to a son. And this changed everything. They finally gave her some sort of respect that she wanted. Unfortunately, a little while later the son died. Needless to say, the woman was beside herself with grief. And she went to all her friends in the city and asked is there some sort of medicine that you can give me that will bring my son back to life. And the people said no, they were sorry, but there was no sort of medicine that they could give that would bring anyone back to life. So in her desperation she went to the Buddha. And she asked the same thing, was there some sort of medicine that he could give that would bring her son back to life. And he said to her, if you would go into every house in the city, and when you get there, ask the people who lived in the houses to give you a mustard seed if they have not experienced any death. And when you have collected all the mustard seeds from the people that you visit, bring it back to me. Well she went back and she spoke to the many people within the city. But everyone had experienced death of some sort. So when she got back to the Buddha she told him, she said, everyone has felt – experienced death. And I have no seeds. And the Buddha explained her to, that this was the way of life. That death was part of living. And it was something that would happen. And the woman began to understand that even though the people had experienced death, they still seemed to get on with their life. And maybe there was hope for her to get over her grief. So she gathered up all the mustard seeds in her house she placed them around her son and she buried him.

JAN MOJSA Most deaths fulfill the natural order of things. But the death of a child is particularly unbearable because it upsets this natural order. For a mother, this is especially difficult. For she's the one who's obviously carried the child in her womb. And often been the one who spent time nurturing it in infancy. But any parent who's lost a child will tell you that they're lives are changed forever. And finding the words to describe such grief is pretty near impossible. 

00:23:05
"There is a pain – so utter" 

00:23:05
Emily Dickinson 1830 - 1886 

00:23:05
EMILY DICKINSON There is a pain so utter it swallows substance up. And covers the abyss with trance. So memory can step around across upon it. As one within a swoon goes safely. Where an open eye would drop him, bone by bone. 

00:23:20
JAN MOJSA  Clare's story of her daughter Emily's death is recorded in a dairy which she began two days after she died. And wrote right up until 10 years later. Emily died after open heart surgery at Guy's Hospital. Following an attempt to repair a congenital heart defect. She was five and a half years old. Clare's diary entries are at first very frequent, almost daily. And then gradually focus on the anniversaries of the death. Which can be an acute time of remembered grief. Her story is very different from Mary's. But you will hear echoes of the same themes which help us to chart the process of mourning. 

00:24:15
CLARE July the 26, 1993. At three, 35 in the morning on Saturday the twenty-fourth, my darling little Emily died in my arms. The doctors and nurses moved her over on the bed so that I could get up beside her and hold her. Somehow in the tangle of wires and tubes and probes and monitors I gathered her little boy into my arms. And held her as close as I could. The struggle was about to end. All those years of struggle and these last ghastly hours of monumental invasion. Her little body broken open down the middle. Her beautiful, soft, long blond hair matted with sweat and blood entangled around the taps of the lines going into the side of her neck. The fight was lost. Although she tried so hard and fought so long. Slowly, her tiny hands and feet grew colder. My little girl, my beloved daughter, my beautiful loving child was going to die. I didn't think I could bear it. I, her mother, could not make her live. Couldn't mend her broken body and yet longed and longed for her. Before, I had had moments, even after the doctors bleak and hopeless words when I looked for miracle. A reprieve, a chance to keep my most precious child. But by this time all this was past. And I knew I was watching the last moments of her life. It was so painful. So unbearably painful to watch her fight. I longed for the end to come quicker. And we both whispered in her ear that she could let go. And now what? How do I move on from here. What is there in life that has any meaning at all. How can I ever be happy. How can I live without her. I loved her so much. So much and she gave it all back and more. Just giving and giving. Part of what I am today is because of her. And it's the best bit of me. Possible because of her love and strength. Possible because she crept so quietly into my world. And shook it up so violently that nothing will ever be the same again. 

00:27:10
JAN MOJSA Clare's description of the early days after Emily's death are full of the physical pain of loss. The difficulty of facing each day. And trying to cope with the reality of her being gone. It's import to her that she visits the grave every day to be as close as possible to her child. Her ability to engage with outside world, even the demands of her other children are almost nil. 

00:27:40
CLARE I go to bed with sleeping pills. Numb and dry eyed. Too tired to cry any more. Just aching inside. But when I awake such a wave of misery and longing suffices me. As the gray light of dawn tells me that another day has dawned. And Emily is still dead. And I must somehow get through it without her. Then the tears flow and deep racking sobs from my loss and my pain and the sense of finality and emptiness. Twenty-seventh of July 1993, this morning utter desolation. Waves of sadness and misery and a deep aching pain in my gut, make me curl up into a ball and crushing Tom Kitten to my breast. You'll never walk through that door again. And the pain and emptiness is unbearable. What desolation and sadness and sadness and sadness. 

00:28:55
JAN MOJSA Four months later Clare is still struggling with the reality of her Emily's death. But her desolation has given way to angry questions about the unfairness of it all. 

00:29:10
CLARE August the tenth, 1993, last night my sister Molly and I cried together. Why did it have to happen to you of all people, Molly asked in her sadness. You didn't deserve it. Why you. I felt renewed sorrow for myself. Yes, why me. Why. Why, why. It didn't seem to make any sense. And faith was nowhere and god was nowhere. And Emily's needs were nowhere. Just the utter desolation of the loss and the unfairness and the destructiveness of it all. November the eighth, 1993, I've stopped wearing black. Today, at her grave where I sat in the dark crying the emptiness was so bleak and so huge. I feel every day that I am failing her. Failing to be that better person that I aspire to be. To lose my child, my little darling. How can I get over it. How can I remember watching my child die and ever be able to live again. I have strange fantastical ideas that god will make her rise again. That would really show people. I dream of the clock going back before all of this happened. Why do other children come through surgery against the odds when she didn't. Why us? Why me? Why did it ever happen at all? So many questions and no answers. Sometimes I think about dying. It can never have the fear that it would have had for me before. There will be a sense of going to her, being with her. Sometimes I wish for that now. Just to shut off from all the feelings and be with her. I don't feel like killing myself but I feel the hopelessness that longs for death. 

00:31:30
JAN MOJSA This seems to be a common experience that when things at their most bleak, and the grieving person is split open. Some other dimension we might call it the spiritual, the transpersonal helps to answer the questions in the search for meaning. 

00:31:45
HOLY BIBLE 

00:31:45
CLARE  February the seventh 1994. I needed help. I opened the Bible just making sure it was somewhere in the New Testament. I read this, our brothers, we went you to know the truth about those who have died so that you will not be sad as are those you have no hope. We believe that Jesus died and rose again. And so we believe that God will take back with Jesus those who have died believing in him. Never have I asked so directly and received so clearly a message of hope and deliverance. I believe and trust in him. What else have I got. How if not through my weakness and helplessness could I open my heart enough to let Jesus into my life. Thank God. Thank you. 

00:32:55
JAN MOJSA As the years move on, Clare records her feelings and thoughts. You will hear the spiral, the moving in and out of grief and towards a less acute and painful place. 

00:33:10
CLARE July the twenty-fourth 1994, the overwhelming feeling is disbelief. It cannot be a whole year since the pain and loss began. If I had known how much it will still hurt after all these months I would not have got through it. There is an element of having survived. But the rawness and aching and longing is still there. Not so often, perhaps, but just as acute. Strange echoes of this time last year with the phone going nonstop. Cards and flowers arriving, the doorbell ringing. Each contact renews the sadness. But the sense of loving and reaching out to us is extraordinary. It's a kind of wonder, not that some people don't understand how painful this anniversary is, but that so many people do. For me, it has never gone. Not for a moment or two. It's hard to explain how the coping with the loss and the aching and missing and loving have been underneath everything. Both sad and happy at a conscious level, constantly since Emily died. It's the ultimate doing two things at once. It is always there. 

00:34:45
[sil.] 

00:34:50
CLARE July the twenty-second, 1995, this year the anniversary has crept up on me. Despite my attempts to push it away. My new baby is due in two and a half weeks time. I'm large and heavily pregnant. The feelings are difficult. Unlike last year I feel no compunction to relive every moment of summer 93. I'm allowing myself the choice of not drowning in the pain. I could still. But I chose not to. If anything, in the months preceding today, I had reached a new calm. Emily, far from being distant, its more around than ever. More part of all that I do and say. But in a less agonizing and painful way. Strange development. More around but also further away. I began to feel moments of absolute joy with the other children. I felt again the pure joy of my children. And the precious fleetingness of their lives. 

00:36:05

00:36:35
JAN MOJSA In the next film, Michael talks to Fiona about his journey after the death of his wife, Kaisa from cancer. In it, he describes their first meeting and his feelings. He also reflects on the meaning of her death. About his understanding of this idea of acceptance. And the choices that we have in responding to grief. 

00:37:00
MICHAEL VINCENT We first met in 1969 when I was a student at, uh, Chelsea School of Art in London. I met her one afternoon, one Sunday afternoon, um, we had both been invited to tea. Mutual friends. And I remember falling in love with him on that afternoon. Um, thinking what a beautiful woman she is. She is from – or was from what we – what's known as the Karelian Fins. I mean, that – it's a small – smaller group of Finish people who used to live on the Karelian Peninsula before it was overtaken by the – or given over to the Russians at the end of the war. So in effect she began life as a refugee. And was traveling all her life. And came over to England, um, as an au pair. And I met her when she was working in an office in – in Tottenham Court Road. And I just fell in love with her. And that was six months. That was in February 1969. In October 1969 we were married. There was a depth in her. There was a strength in her. There was a sweetness and a charm. Um, she had everything actually that – that I would desire in a woman. And I was very young at the time. I mean, I was – I was – we celebrated my twenty-first birthday together, after we were married. And she was older than me, five years older. Um, she had a maturity and a wisdom. She was also very unhappy. And in some ways quite angry. Um, and I came to understand the reasons for that as we got to know each other over many years. And I think she recognized that ultimate at the end of her life that her resentment and anger, particularly related to her refugee status and the sense of belonging nowhere, that was at the root of her cancer. 

00:38:55
FIONA How long were you married. How long were you together as a couple? 

00:39:00
MICHAEL VINCENT Well we – as I say we met in 69, 1969. We were together six months before we decided to get married. So we were together for 32 years. 

00:39:10
FIONA 32 years. I really want to ask you if you can talk about it, about perhaps how you felt immediately after she died after that long, long struggle with cancer? How did that affect your feelings and your thoughts and how you just lived day to day? 

00:39:25
MICHAEL VINCENT Well, as – as with everything else it's something that – that you can't understand unless you've experienced. And I – I did think that I had – I had prepared myself. Because I had – we had many years together of – of illness and – and talking about death. But I realized within seconds of her passing that – that I hadn't – that – that something really changed in me profoundly. Um, there was that sense that I was dead – dead too. Um, there was that sense of – of total deadness within. Um, that I – I just didn't – I felt – well, I just didn't feel alive anymore myself. That I had also passed away. And that – and there was that desire too to pass away. 

00:40:15
FIONA Part of you in that really tough period wanted to just give up? 

00:40:20
MICHAEL VINCENT Oh yes. 

00:40:20
FIONA Just -- 

00:40:20
MICHAEL VINCENT To let go. 

00:40:20
FIONA -- to give into it and -- 

00:40:20
MICHAEL VINCENT Very much so. I – it doesn't surprise me that – it – when you do visit graveyards or grave places where people are – that rest, there's the – there's the wife and there's the husband. 

00:40:30
FIONA Yes. And there's no gap between. 

00:40:35
MICHAEL VINCENT No. And if particularly if you've been in love and you've been together for so long. Um, and – and so often I thought, yeah, just – just give me the – please. But then I checked myself. 

00:40:50
FIONA Yes. 

00:40:50
MICHAEL VINCENT And – and one of the reasons I stopped was that, you know, if I go now Kaiser won't be happy. She'll be – she'll be quite ashamed of me that I gave up so easily. 

00:41:00
FIONA So she was still -- 

00:41:00
MICHAEL VINCENT Oh yes. 

00:41:00
FIONA -- there, exerting her -- 

00:41:00
MICHAEL VINCENT Absolutely. 

00:41:00
FIONA How to live. 

00:41:05
MICHAEL VINCENT Absolutely. 

00:41:05
FIONA Yes. 

00:41:05
MICHAEL VINCENT I mean it was, um, how we shared things. Just that I would be there for her and say come on, you know, this – and we'll work on this together. She was with me. And I – and I could not – of course I couldn't, I mean, I said this to my daughter many times, um, no, there's no way I'm going to go and meet Kaisa yet. I mean, I've got a lot more to do in my life. And she'd be telling me off if I came so early on anyway. 

00:41:30
FIONA Can you say what happened next in terms of the journey. 

00:41:35
MICHAEL VINCENT Yes. I mean I had a number of health problems myself. Um, my heart – my blood pressure, um, became a real problem. Um, asthmatic attacks, and migraine headaches. Um, lethargy, lethargy and depression. All these challenges. Lots of skin problems. Scratching, itching. Um, all as a consequence of an undermining of my inner health system. I mean, the immune system. Very vulnerable to colds and flu. I ended up in hospital with a sort of combination of aspirin pneumonia. And had – of course, was offered drugs for everything. 

00:42:05
FIONA You mentioned anniversaries as – as being a really difficult time. And you were just about to come for one, aren't you? 

00:42:15
MICHAEL VINCENT Yes. 

00:42:15
FIONA So tell – can you say a bit about what they've been like for you? 

00:42:20
MICHAEL VINCENT They – they have become, um, less painful. I mean, obviously birthdays and wedding anniversaries. Um, but particularly the – the time of death, the passing of Kaisa. Um, but it has changed. I mean, I've noticed how my feelings have not changed. And how – how less painful those days are. And as I say, that as – that now I – I simply by flowers and celebrate, um, those days. I – the – the next will be the second of April which will be the sixth – six years since her death. And I'll make a journey to her spot over in Walton and – and place flowers as always. And – and look at her photograph and say what a wonderful woman. You know, and – and how – what a privilege it was to be with you. And to still have you with me. Um, so it does change each – each year. Um, it's the first year that's the most difficult. And – and then it does ease, it does change. And one does understand that the light at every tunnel there is light. Um, no matter how dark it might – might be at the time. It's -- the state of acceptance. Um, a link to surrender. And surrender not in the terms of giving in, but it – surrender in terms of okay, I've got this problem but can't deal with it now. So, let's just hand it over, to the divine, to God whoever – whatever name you want to use. So, there will be an answer. And it's accepting that everything has a purpose. That there is a reason for this. Um, there's a lesson to be learned from every experience. And there are choices to be made. Um, I accepted I actually – I worked to go down a certain path. I could have gone down another path towards my own death and a very quick one. But that junction in your life, that – that crossroads if you – whatever you want to call it, I chose to go down a certain other road. Which was – reaching that stage of acceptance and learning from in a very positive way from this experience. So it's a very, very important word. Um, we use it often in – in everyday life as – as our lives change. Our lifestyle changes as our bodies change. Instead of demanding or wanting plastic surgery, as – to keep our bodies as they are, to accept that they are going to be changing as we get older. It's working with all those things in life that, um – not just the bad. I mean the good, not the bad but the challenging. Um, accepting that the state of happiness is a good thing. We have every right to be happy. To have the courage to be happy. Wonderful. 

00:45:00
FIONA And you were given a word to help you with this, weren't you.

00:45:00
MICHAEL VINCENT Well the – it was the name Tatigat. Um, and there isn't a western translation of that. Um, it means suchness, isness. I mean, in the Buddhist sense of, the – this is as it is. And we can use the word acceptance. I mean, that's the nearest – as far as I understand. This is as it is. Um, and rather than kicking it, it's that rather than resisting it, rather than repressing it, rather than pretending it's not there, to work with it. Um, this is as it is. This is as I am. I mean the first thing I did was to write – write this book. Um, which was about Kaisa's journey. But it was also about her – the program she developed. Um, in dealing with cancer from a complementary standpoint. But I've used my – I am a painter. And I've used my creativity. There are a number of paintings which are on the show in the center here, which do, reflect on that journey. Particularly from the years 96 when she was re – re-diagnosed with cancer. Um, and be – this became a very challenging time. To the time when she died and beyond. 

00:46:15
FIONA So you were painting right through the period. 

00:46:15
MICHAEL VINCENT I have recorded this journey. 

00:46:20
FIONA Yeah. 

00:46:20
MICHAEL VINCENT Particularly in a – in a series of four oil paintings. Um, which have titles, uh, very relevant to this. Um, they are essentially about life, death and resurrection. Um, and they are very important paintings to me. But I have noted also that they do tend to have quite an impact on other people. Um, in a way that – in way we're talking that, um, so I did use my own creativity. Um, and I mean, a lot of creativity is such a – a life energy. I mean, being creative can change how we are in a very positive way. So I used my creative energy to help transform how I was. Uh, whether it's through writing this book or painting pictures, dancing, music, whatever. I have now moved into a period of celebration. Um, and realizing that the – the grief has been a great teacher. Um, and that my body has been, uh, also, um, fantastic at teaching me a number of very, very important lessons about life and death. And the whole journey that we're on.

Task of Mourning 

00:47:45
1. Accept the reality of the loss 

00:47:45
2. Work through the pain of grief 

00:47:45
3. Adjust to the environment 

00:47:45
4. Find an appropriate place for the person 

00:47:45
in your heart and re-invest in life 

00:47:45
1. Accepting the reality of the loss 

00:47:45
"The Spirit Files" 

00:47:45
JAN MOJSA Some people have seen the loss curve as a very passive model for understanding grief. In other words that the person suffering grief is passive and powerless as the rollercoaster carries them along. William Worden in his book, Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy offers a different way of looking at this journey. He suggests that it can be helpful and empowering to consider that there are certain tasks of mourning. Which are essential to reestablish equilibrium. He sees the tasks of mourning as, firstly accepting the reality of the loss. Secondly, to work through the pain of grief. Thirdly to adjust to the environment. And fourthly, to find an appropriate place for the person in your heart and to reinvest in life. Worden is careful to explain that these tasks do not happen neatly in and in some kind of order. He embraces the idea of moving in and out of each phase. And the inevitability of revisiting of the early pain and feelings. It's also significant that the idea of acceptance as the final hurdle has given way to a different sense of finding a way to keep the person as part of who you are, and with you, but in a less acute and painful way. He adds something new to our understanding of grief in his emphasis on the need to look ahead. And to take the risk of reinvesting in life and in loving. How have we seen these tasks in the films we've seen. You can hear the difficult in believing that the person is dead. And the impossibility of being prepared. Clare talks about expecting a miracle. About strange fantastical ideas about Emily coming to life again. Even while she knows that this is not possible. One way that we can deal with the reality of someone being dead is by having rituals both public and private. Funerals and ceremonies offer the opportunity to say good bye. And to be with others who knew and loved the deceased. Mary for example took John's ashes to the Ganges River. And she planted a bush called Honesty. Clare also planted flowers. She planted the baby Emily flowers from the seeds that Emily herself grew the previous year. And Michael transformed his daytime painting of rural Summerset into the Spirit Flies. Ashes have even been blasted into space. There seems to be something about connecting with the earth, the elements. And the natural world. 

00:50:55

00:51:00
2. Work through the pain of grief 

00:51:00
JAN MOJSA Working through the pain of grief. This is the biggest and hardest part. Mary Parks says it's necessary for the bereaved person to go through the pain of grief. And that anything that continually allows the person to avoid or suppress the pain is likely to prolong the course of mourning. Mary for example calls it the rollercoaster. She speaks about the conflict between the rational thoughts and the irrational feelings. Common feelings are feelings like sadness, anger, guilt, self-reproach, anxiety, loneliness, tiredness, yearning, relief, and numbness. And the physical sensations of grief can include hollowness in the stomach, tightness in the chest and throat, weakness in the muscles, exhaustion, and fatigue. Dry mouth. Michael for example also records his health problems and weakened immune system. Anger and guilt can be the hardest to bear. Because it feels more complicated than sorrow and sadness. Let's listen to Mary explain her experience. 

00:52:15
MARY PRIEST-COBERN Yeah. The feeling of guilt was the hugest feeling I had. It was because I couldn't – I wasn't there to fix it. Obviously which I had mentioned before. And, um, guilt is a really difficult one because it – it's like you're not doing your remit, you know. You're – you're not – you're not actually fulfilling your duty. You're, um, abandoning ship or, you know, you're – and it's – it's like a really difficult one, guilt. Because – and it – and it's real. It's real being guilty, you know. I mean, on one side it's be – it's real. But on another side, philosophically, you know, oh gosh, well this is time to go. Why am I feeling guilty, you know. I mean, it's his journey with his demine torse, you know. And it was his time. And release him and allow him to go. And, um, it's something primal about that as well. And about anger as well. It's something that just gets you down there and you just want to – you just want to scream. And you – you just can't – you can't do anything about it. It's beyond your control, you know. And you just feel like consumed by oh my God why did you do that, you know. You've kind of – you know, and it's like why has this happened to me then, you know. What have I done wrong that is, you know, I'm getting punished here. You know, like oh my God, what have I – you know, what's this all about. What I have done to deserve this. And it's like, these feelings really kind of – kind of consume you. And you just think, why. You know, you go into this big question mark. And this question mark is – you can't answer it. Because it's not logical. And – but you're looking for – you're looking for something to target. You kwon, to blame. And then you're – then the guilt is blaming yourself. 

00:54:25
JAN MOJSA Worden also lists some of the behaviors. Sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance, social withdrawal, restless over activity, crying, visiting places or carrying objects that remind one of the dead person, and dreams of the deceased. Clare records a particularly vivid dream that she had on the first anniversary of Emily's death. 

00:54:55
CLARE July the twenty-fourth 1994, last night I had my second dream about Emily. It wasn't nearly as long as vividly recalled as the first, some months ago. But I woke quite suddenly in the early hours of the morning. All my senses alert and aware. Not sleepy at all, and with the overwhelming feeling that Emily had been with me. She wasn't still there. But it was as if she had just left and had been there. Emily held in her hand a child's purse or wallet and was taking bits of paper out and spreading them on the bed. She was absorbed in a private game. She turned her head towards me as I came up behind her and smiled. She looked happy and relaxed. Again, a little older than the child who died. She was calm and pink. Serene and self contained. I felt a sense of huge relief that she was safe. She seemed to be alone but she was quite happy. And out of the dreaded rat race. I'm all right her face seemed to say. I felt a quietness and peace that she was safe and happy. Playing her own game, not trying go keep up with everybody else. I woke up. She seemed in that moment when she looked round at me, to be there. I had just missed her. 

00:56:30
JAN MOJSA  The desire to be dead and to be with a loved one echoes through all three stories. 

00:56:40
3. To adjust to the environment 

00:56:45
[sil.] 

00:56:50
JAN MOJSA When a person dies, you lose not only them as an individual but all the many things about them that both define their role and your identity. A partner may also be a best friend, an accountant, the family decision maker, the babysitter, the joker in the family. All social and family interactions are profoundly affected. A couple becomes a single person. A mother loses contact with the parents and children in her child's class. She may no longer be a mother of daughters, or sons. She may not even be a mother at all. This list is endless. And in every case has a profound impact on the identify of the bereaved person. And on their sense of self and their purpose in life. 

00:57:50
4. Find an appropriate place for 

00:57:50
the person in your heart and 

00:57:50
re-invest in life 

00:57:55
[sil.] 

00:58:00
"a mourner never altogether forgets the 

00:58:00
dead person who was so highly valued 

00:58:00
in life and never totally withdraws his 

00:58:00
investment in his representation. 

00:58:00
We can never purge those who have been 

00:58:00
close to us from our own history except by 

00:58:00
psychic acts damaging to our own identity." 

00:58:00
Volkan, V (1985) Complicated Mourning 

00:58:00
Annual of Psychoanalysis, 12, 323-348 

00:58:00
JAN MOJSA Acceptance is not an easy word to deal with. Many bereaved people revolt at the idea that acceptance suggests that mourning is over. And that they should move on. This space to grieve seems to shrink as the weeks pass. Many widows and widowers say that they feel that there comes a moment when they can no longer talk about their loved one. They're expected to be over it or moving on. All three speakers seem to have a much more complex and rich understanding of what this particular stage is about. In every case it seems to have strong links with a need to find meaning in what happened. And to carry the sense of the dead person with them, but in a less painful way. It seems to be less about acceptance and more about finding a place to hold the memory and meaning of the dead person. Volkan said, a mourner never altogether forgets the dead person who was so highly valued in life and never totally withdraws his investment in his representation. We can never purge those who have been close to us from our own history, except by psychic acts damming to our own identity. More recent research has identified the notion of chronic sorrow. Which accepts that after particularly traumatic losses a person can both re-engage with life and still at key moments be flung back painfully to moments of loss. And the associated feelings. And this is normal. As Mary said, it never goes away. But you – you learn to live with it. And Clare's thoughts 10 years after Emily's death describe this very vividly. 

01:00:05
CLARE July the twenty-fourth, 2003, 10 years on. I am alone in the house. Tonight everyone is expectantly out. I've cooked out of date chicken bits and burnt them. I'm not hungry. My throat closed. It never goes away. It's not the same, except in that moment when the pain slices into consciousness. But it never goes away. I feel sad and close to her again. And sadder than I felt for a very long time. For all that pain and loss and her short life. And I'm going to go to her grave in a minute, to sit in the dark and smoke and think about her. And I'm so glad to have the time and the space. No mother should have to watch her child die. I did it. I will never be the same person that I was. And a lot of what I have become I value. I am proud of. And I have things still to do. But I would give everything I have not to have gone through this. And to have spared my whole family what we went through. I love you, Emily. I feel it strongly tonight. I hope you are happy. And that if there is a heaven that you will be there. God bless you my little darling. Be well. Be well. 

01:01:40
JAN MOJSA  The hardest part is to dare to love again. And to reinvest in life and living. Michael tells us about this. 

01:01:55
MICHAEL VINCENT The last thing that – that came alive within myself and that's only just in the last few months is – is my – my whole sexual awareness. My – my ability to be able to relate to other women now. Um, that was the – the very last and the deepest. Um, I mean, I – I went through a period of time thinking no more relationships, no more contact with women. I can't bear this. Uh, if it happened again in my life. Got through that. I've met many lovely women through this center here. And I now have a very good friendship with one particular woman. And it's great. And I've come alive completely. 

01:02:30
FIONA And that was the last bit of you to waken. 

01:02:30
MICHAEL VINCENT But that was the last – because it was the most – it's – it's in this – the sacral chakara area that's in the – the life energy area. The life force area that your sexuality, your life energy which had died and which will – needed to be reborn in myself. And it was actually achieving that. And that could only be achieved largely through contact with other – with women. 

01:02:55
FIONA Being in relationships? 

01:02:55
MICHAEL VINCENT Yeah. Being in a – another relationship. Um, that was something I couldn't do on my own. And I – only a few months ago I wondered how on earth am I ever going to bring that back. But it's happened. But you're talking of a journey of six years. It's six years now since my wife died. And it's still not over. I don't think it ever is. But, um, it's an amazing thing. And it's a great learning experience. And, um, there are many, many aspects to it. 

01:03:20
MARY PRIEST-COBERN  For me it doesn't end when we die. And that there is a connection I chose to believe between all beings. And that I can close my eyes and I know that, um, that relationship is still alive. And it's not alive in a sentimental place. It's alive in a -- in a deep inner space. And it's really taught me that every heart connection is, um, is real. And it allows – it gives me the strength to see the loss as not an emotional event. But part of life. Part of the journey of being human.

01:06:30
MARY PRIEST-COBERN When I agreed to – to share my story I was amazing, the feelings that came up around this loss. And I just was really aware of the feelings, um, were very much within the fabric of who I am still. Even though I wasn't, um, you know, even though it's – it's a long time away. Um, when I go to that place, that place still has the – the emotions, the pain, the anger, disappointment, guilt. That they're all just kind of you know, and just kind of agreeing to talk about it, I could see them, these feelings, really bubbling up on the surface. So it's like I've – you know, like that roomy poem, the Guesthouse where, you know, um, a guest comes to your door and you are gracious. And you invite them in. And you show them to a room. And you leave the door ajar. So – so there in your space but they're not in your face if you know what I mean. And I think that was one of the ways of – of me, um, helping to deal with the loss of my husband. Um, and that I actually found a place within myself that I could, um, sit with those feelings. That those feelings were contained but they weren't destroying me. They weren't in my face all the time. You know, initially when it first happens, you're in absolute shock. And, um, I just remember when John did die, um, I was working, um, for a newspaper. I was – I was – it was bank holiday. And, um, I was on the early morning shift. And, um, I had, um – and about six or about five o'clock in the morning John had a seizure. I – because he suffered from epilepsy. And, um, so it was a regular occurrence. But he didn't have them – oh, he had at least one a month, probably. And he was on meds for it. And the usual process if he had a seizure, you know, you kind of – you know, you turned him over and then he would just sleep it off. And, um, I – you know, so I was – you know, that happened. He had a seizure. You know, turned over, make – sit with him for awhile. Car waiting outside. Have to go to work. Um, bank holiday, nobody's in, hardly. Didn't think he was going to die. Going back to the feelings of loss and actually to engage with the feelings of loss I have to engage with the moment of my loss. And when I engage with the moment of my loss I engage with the scenario that happened, uh, that day. And, you know, I engage with, um, the fact that I did – you know, I left him. And I got in the car and I went to work. And then I – I woke up my son and said, you know, um, check him out in a half an hour. And it was about seven o'clock I went to work. And I rang at eight o'clock. And, you know, he didn't check him. And he was asleep and he woke up and he went in and he was unconscious. And they called the ambulance. And I had to leave work. And, um, yeah, and I just had to – I just remember the panic of trying to get to the hospital before he died. 

01:10:40
UNKNOWN So – so I guess there's something about engaging with – with what was an ordinary day became extraordinary. And just noticing both the panic and the shock. 

01:10:55
MARY PRIEST-COBERN And the anger too. Like why did he die. Why did he die. He was only 42. And then the guilt kicked in. Because I couldn't save him. And, um, then you just kind of, you know, I just can see him still there, dead. 

01:11:30
[sil.] 

01:11:35
MARY PRIEST-COBERN And in that place you just have to pause and just kind of know that it all, um, is part of life, you know. It's part of life. It's part of life. And you have to just hold it. And you never forget it. Because you can – when you tell the story you journey back to that moment in time. Which is still in the fabric of who you are. It's still part of your story. And, you know, it's – it's a powerful story. Because it shows me so much about, um, who I am. And it tell – shows me about, um, you know, an intimate loving relationship is, you know, so much a physical thing, but it's, you know, that kind of heart world doesn't leave when the person leaves. And that's – you know, that's actually, um, helped me to know that he's safe wherever he is. And that where ever he is in the world or in heaven, or in the cosmos, somewhere, his spirit is still with me. Because it's – it's carried in love. And, um, the journey of loss and – and there's so much around loss because, you know, it's like we've got loss and we've got gain, you know. We've got loss is bad. And gain is good. And it's like, sitting with, well this is bad. But it – it's like really I've had to sit with that it's, it is. It's part of being living. It's part of being human is that you experience loss. Yeah, I mean, obviously there was guilt because I couldn't be there. And I – you know, he was always on about – you know, he wasn't pleased I was, you know, working on the weekends. You know, because he – and it was bank holiday and I had to go in, you know. So, it was like – and he really wanted to move to the country. And we were in London. And, you know, so it was, like, he was doing it for – for my son and for me. Because, you know, it was just – we had to do that at this time in order to manage. And there was a lot of anger as well. Which -- anger about, you know, how could you leave now. Like why? You know, and – and it wasn't – it wasn't rational anger. It was just, like, oh bother, you know. You know, like, you've abandoned us. You know, you've abandoned us now. And – and it's not like rational. It's something that just kind of sits there and you just saying, oh my god. You know, now we're on our own. Now we're on our own. Now we – you know, now this, it's over, so to speak. And intellectually and philosophically you can think one thing. But in your feelings you have to just kind of sit with them and you have to be in them. And you have to go the rollercoaster of that. And it is a rollercoaster. Grief, bereavement, loss. And you try to fill your days with other things, you know, to – but, you – you get home from work and they're not there. You know. There's like a big empty space. And you try to fill that space. And you – you just can't. You – you just – there's nothing that will fill that space. So you have to sit with the space. And sit in the space. And let it be.

MARY PRIEST-COBERN And, um, as time goes by sitting there, you learn to cope with that.

MARY PRIEST-COBERN It never goes away. But you learn to live with it. John was beautiful person. Wise, and he was from Summerset. Sounded American, you know. So he was – he was from Summerset. He loved the west country. He used to make jokes, you know. About, you know, he used to speak and sometimes he'd do his Summerset Rs, you know. Cider. He liked his – his pint of cider. Bless him. He had a wicked sense of humor. A really soulful person. He had bad health for a long time. So, you know, in some ways it was a real relief for him to take off, you know. Because the body wasn't well. Uh, bless him. Actually he's free, you know. It's like he's okay. It's not him. It's, like, you know, it's picking up the pieces. It's, like, getting on, you know. Chopping wood, carrying water kind of stuff, you know. It's just like picking up and carrying on with a big vacant space in your life. Because, you know, when you're together with somebody, they – you kind of merge. You become one, you know. You just have a life that's – that's shared. And then when this – when it's gone, then it's – it's like realigning yourself. And, um, it's okay. It's okay. And I'm feeling better now. Because I know that everything is actually okay. And I feel like I've had to kind of journey into a part of myself that these feelings are still contained. But they're – when I go to that moment in time, it's like I'm not – that moment in time is still real. It's helped me to really, um, listen more. To sit with my feelings. Yeah, the feeling of guilt was the hugest feeling I had. It was because I couldn't – I wasn't there to fix it. Obviously which I had mentioned before. And, um, guilt is a really difficult one. Because it – it's like you're not doing your remit, you know. You're – you're not – you're not actually fulfilling your duty. You're, um, abandoning ship or, you know, you're -- and it's – it's like a really difficult one, guilt. Because – and it – and it's real. It's real being guilty, you know. I mean, on one side it's being – it's real. But on another side, philosophically, you know, oh gosh, well it was his time to go. Why am I feeling guilty, you know. I mean, it's his journey with this divined, source, you know. And it's was his time. And release him and allow him to go. And, um, it's something primal about that as well. And about anger as well. It's something that just gets you down there. And you just want to – you just want to scream. And you – you just can't – you can't do anything about it. It's beyond your control, you know. And you just feel like consumed by, oh my god why did you do that, you know. You've kind of – you know, and it's like, why has this happened to me then, you know. What have I done wrong that is, you know, I'm getting punished here. You know. Second husband dying. You know, like, oh my god. What have I – you know, what's this all about. What have I done to deserve this. And it's like these feelings, really kind of – kind of consume you. And you just think, why. You know, you go into this big question mark. And this question mark is – you can't answer it. Because it's not logical. And – but you're looking for – you're looking for something to target, you know. You – to blame. And then you're – then the guilt is blaming yourself, ultimately. It's – it's a funny little table or, uh, a plate of emotions that you experience in going through a bereavement and a loss. And it's something that, um, I'm – from my journey I've found that I just have to kind of detach from it a little bit. To survive from it. And in that detachment I kind of, look at it from another angle, you know. I kind of – I kind of step back from the feelings a little bit. And this is a survival technique. I step back from the feelings and I just kind of go to my breath. And I just watch. And I kind of watch, like, when you meditate or something like that. You just kind of watch the feelings. And you don't hook on them and engage with them. But you just kind of breathe with them. And, you know, they're part of the fabric of – and you try to kind of step back from the emotional relationship with it. And it's not that it's not real. Because it is real. But at the same time you're – you're more watchful. You're – you're not coping an attitude about your feelings if you know what I mean. You're actually, you're in them. And you know, I started going for long walks, you know. And I just felt like I just wanted to be on the earth. And I jsut – and I work in the garden, you know. You just really want to connect with the earth when that happens. And listen to music. But – and I couldn't actually look at a picture of John for ages. Couldn't have any pictures around because the pictures were too painful.

MARY PRIEST-COBERN So I planted a tree for him. A bush actually. Honesty. He was an honest person so I thought, oh I should just – I still got some seeds here actually at the garden. So I planted – I planted Honesty. I thought, yes. He likes – he was simple, you know. And, um, it's not even a perennial, is it. Well it does come back. It reseeds easily. Yeah. It's about – and then I just have to do something, you know. You can watch and be detached a bit. But just – it's been helpful to – to do something. So it's okay. Everybody loses. And I have a loss too. But that's okay. Because I have so many gifts that I've received from this loss. And that's not just twee gifts. But it's actually I've -- insights come through the journey of loss. And those insights are like kind of flowers in my life. No, I mean, when you plant a tree or a bush or a flower for somebody you plant it with an intention. And that intention is, it's a living intention really because you're pushing – you're gifting, um, the memory of that person. And you're connecting it with the earth. Which we're, you know, so much part of the earth. And – and, um, and so you know, as you do kind of that ritual of planting a tree or a bush or a flower or just doing something, um, and then you sit and pause. And I think the pause is an important thing because that's one of the gifts. That's one of the flowers. Is to pause and to just kind of breath. And to just give thanks for the gift of that friendship and that affection and that – that wonderful person that you – you shared some really beautiful moments with. And that's one of the flowers, is the memories. The memories and – and the walks in the park. And the music. And, um, the silences as well. Death is something that's not talked about. And it's – it's always a tragedy and it's always – and it's something to be feared. And, um – and because it affects our own mortality as well. And through the journey of living with my loss I've had to see that, you know, I don't want to get too philosophical, but I've had to see that, um, it has brought, um – it's changed my relationship with my environment. It's changed my relationship with myself. It – the loss has brought new life. And that new life is, um, for me, and this is maybe – this is one of the things that I live with it has brought that, um, it – for me it doesn't end when we die. And that there is a connection I chose to believe between all beings. And that I can close my eyes and I know that, um, that relationship is still alive. And it's not alive in a sentimental place. It's alive in a – in a deep inner space. And it's really taught me that every heart connection is, um, is real. For me. And, you know, that's – that's actually been a massive gift. Because when you – when I feel that it's more than just what it is on one surface, then it gives it more meaning for me. And that meaning allows it to be. And it allows – it gives me the strength to see the loss as not an emotional event but part of life. Part of the journey of being human. And, uh, and I'm still on that journey, you know, I just – I haven't fixed it. But I have strategies that help me to really honor and that it's, uh – that I – that there's mystery there. And that mystery is like a bud, opening, flowers again. It's like the – you know, it's like when a bud is closed you don't know what the flower is going to look like. But as it opens it starts revealing itself and the fragrance. It starts coming out and it – it's alive. It has a story. And, uh, so it's just connecting with the story and allowing it to be. Without judgment. My strategy of coping. Well, you know, for about – for about four months I didn't, you know, do much – well I had to go back to work. And I had a child. Well, he was 17 but he was still a child. So, you know, when you have a child you actually can't just wallow. You actually have to get on with life. So I came back. And then I had two weeks off work and then I had to get back to work. And actually that was good. It was actually really good to, let's carry on with life. Let's do, you know – let's do – it's, you know, everybody gave me a bit of space. And it's kind of awkward, you know, because, you know, people want to help you but they don't know how. And it's, aww, it's difficult. But, you know, weekends were the worst or weekends I wasn't working were the worst. Nighttimes were more difficult. But, um, you – the strategy is you just keep busy. And you sit with the feelings. And time heals them. It's like it takes time. You can't force it. You got to – and you never get over it as we've seen in my journey today. Because it's 14 years it's a long time. But you never get over that moment as, you know, I never realized the emotions that are still behind telling the story. But in the same time the distance, the time distance actually helps you to, um, learn to live with the feelings.
