00:00:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB You don’t wanna draw, huh? 

00:00:00
TRAY Ah…huh… I don't wanna do nothing. 

00:00:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB You don’t wanna do nothing. Well, what are we gonna do? 

00:00:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB Like adults, children can experience psychological distress in response to crisis events in their lives. They may feel helpless, confused, sad, and angry. 

00:00:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB You have some troubles and worry sometimes? No. You don’t? I never knew anybody who never has any troubles or worry. 

00:00:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB Some will require therapeutic intervention, but most do not have a vocabulary sophisticated enough to describe their feelings. 

00:00:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB Here comes the bus and you’re gonna wave bye-bye to mummy. 

00:00:45
NATALIE Bye-bye. 

00:00:50
NANCY BOYD WEBB Bye-bye. 

00:00:50
NANCY BOYD WEBB However, children in therapy can communicate their concerns, feelings, desires, and fears quite powerfully through the metaphoric language of play.

00:01:10
Techniques of Play Therapy A Clinical Demonstration with Nancy Boyd Webb, DSW Registered Play Therapy Supervisor 

00:01:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB Oh, you got six, you’re gonna go way ahead of me. 

00:01:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB Because many children with difficulties are unable to communicate their needs verbally. Mental health practitioners need to use the nonverbal communication method of play therapy to engage and help these young children. 

00:01:40
KATY Mmm… 

00:01:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB Someone ever stopped being friends with you? 

00:01:45
KATY No. 

00:01:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB No? You're lucky because that would be make you very sad, I’m sure. 

00:01:50
NANCY BOYD WEBB In this program, you will see several children working with a variety of play materials, Natalie, Tray, Willey, Katy, and Joanna. Each is a different age and each came to therapy for different reasons. These case examples will demonstrate a range of play therapy techniques and also illustrate the role of the therapist in enabling children to reveal and cope with their problems through the symbolic communication of play therapy. 

00:02:30
What is Play Therapy? 

00:02:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB Children play out their feelings just as adults talk out theirs. 

00:02:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm…Hmm… Mom tell you what kind of a doctor I am? Do you know I’m a doctor, but I don’t give shots or anything like that? I help kids with their worries. You know what a worry is, hmm? 

00:02:55
NANCY BOYD WEBB In order to help children deal more directly with their traumatic experiences, the therapist has to understand and use their method of communication, namely the language of play. 

00:03:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB, D.S.W. Professor, Fordham Univ. Graduate School of Social Service Sometimes when kids come here, they talk, and sometimes they play. They can do whatever they want. Play therapy is a form of therapy that we use with children, because children don’t have very good language ability and whereas adults in therapy will speak, children speak, but they, since their vocabulary is limited. It’s important to communicate with them in the manner in which they're comfortable, and in which they can convey their feelings, and this happens through play. Play is the child’s natural medium of expression. 

00:03:50
NANCY BOYD WEBB Who do they say over here? 

00:03:55
WILLEY A lion. 

00:03:55
NANCY BOYD WEBB And what are… what are they gonna say to him? 

00:04:00
WILLEY Hello. 

00:04:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hello Mr. Lion. 

00:04:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB In trying to understand play therapy, it is important to note that while the process may look very simple, there is a great deal going on in addition to play. 

00:04:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB Play therapy is at the same time very simple and it’s very complicated. And the simple part is that almost anyone can play with a child if you like children and you have any ability to empathize with them, but the play therapist in addition to being involved in this interactive process with the child, is simultaneously trying to understand the meaning of the child’s play, and to analyze that and then to play back something with the child that will communicate a therapeutic response. 

00:04:50
NANCY BOYD WEBB Now, what kind of a person is this? 

00:04:55
KATY A robot. 

00:04:55
NANCY BOYD WEBB A robot. 

00:05:00
KATY Yeah. 

00:05:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB Okay. 

00:05:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB Play therapy is complicated because the analytical process is going on in the therapist's mind while the actual play with the child is taking place simultaneously. 

00:05:10
Goals of Play Therapy Bring about some relief for the problem Facilitate the child’s optimal development 

00:05:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB There are two basic goals of play therapy. The first and foremost goal is to bring about some relief for whatever problem the child has come in with. The second equally important goal is to facilitate the child’s optimal development. In other words, to let the normal growth process proceed by removing any obstacles that might interfere with that process. 

00:05:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB Oftentimes this comes as a side benefit to play therapy insofar as the child through the therapeutic process feels better about him or herself, but has improved self-esteem and therefore is better able to function in his or her life. 

00:06:00
KATY What is the worst thing you can do to someone? 

00:06:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB The worst thing you can do to someone. 

00:06:05
KATY Break up friendship. 

00:06:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB Break up a friendship, yeah. Did that ever happened to you? 

00:06:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB The point to remember is that most children come to the attention of a therapist because of a specific problem. Helping the child overcome that problem is of primary importance. What is equally important; however, is the opportunity to help the child become more self-reliant and confident through the process of helping. In other words, alleviation of symptoms represents only part of the benefits of successful play therapy. 

00:06:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB Tell about something you did that made you feel good about yourself. 

00:06:50
NANCY BOYD WEBB Many times the ripple effect of a positive outcome proves to be more significant as a long-term benefit. 

00:07:00
Role of the Parent 

00:07:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB We talked on the phone, you have some worries about your daughter and her name is Natalie. 

00:07:10
Right. 

00:07:15
NANCY BOYD WEBB Yeah. 

00:07:15
Right. 

00:07:15
NANCY BOYD WEBB And how old is she? 

00:07:15
She is four… 

00:07:15
NANCY BOYD WEBB Four? 

00:07:15
…and she is going to be five in August. 

00:07:20
NANCY BOYD WEBB So, she is almost five. 

00:07:20
Almost five. 

00:07:20
NANCY BOYD WEBB And would you tell me what you’re concerned about. 

00:07:25
Well, umm… she’s going to be studying kindergarten in September. 

00:07:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:30
And I’m concerned about a lot of changes that she has to go through. 

00:07:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB Ah…Huh… 

00:07:35
Ah… for example, the bus. 

00:07:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm… hmm… 

00:07:35
She has to be taking a bus to school, and although she is going to be with her older brother, umm… I think that it’s gonna be a little… 

00:07:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm… hmm… 

00:07:45
Anxiety producing. 

00:07:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm… hmm… 

00:07:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB The role of the parent in play therapy is critical, because parents are often the therapist’s strongest allies in the child’s treatment. 

00:07:55
NANCY BOYD WEBB Has she told you that she is a little worried? 

00:08:00
Well, she hasn’t, but I’m, I’m worried and… 

00:08:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB The work with the parent or guardian is critical to the success of the work with the child, because the child is with the therapist for very short time in the course of their week whereas they’re living with the parent and it’s essential for the parent to feel included and to feel respected by the therapist. What I generally do, I mean you’ve given me a good idea about what your concerns are. And now, I would like to ask you some questions about her development, what she’s been like as a young child and her growth. 

00:08:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB If the child is under 10 years old, I generally see the parent or parents together first, and the reason for that is really two fold. The first purpose is to get a complete background about the nature of the problem and the child’s developmental history, how they have developed up to the present, if the parent has had concerns about the child all through their life, or whether this is a recent, very easily identifiable problem. The second major purpose of seeing the parent is to help the parent prepare the child to come to see me and we talk about what they would say to the child and how they will prepare the child to come. 

00:09:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB But it’s important for her to have some understanding about why she’s coming to see me. So, umm… what do you think you could say to her that would make her interested and not afraid? 

00:09:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB It’s very beneficial when the parent has met with me first, because then they can give the child a verbal description of the office or what I’m like so that they can convey a level of comfort to the child. 

00:09:55
What can I say to her? I could say that, that we’re going to see umm… a lady that, that works with children… 

00:10:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm… hmm… 

00:10:05
…and, that's um… and sometimes the children have difficulties with, with different things. They have worries, they have concerns. 

00:10:15
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm… hmm… 

00:10:15
I may ask her “what is a worry?” She knows what worry is… 

00:10:20
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm… hmm… 

00:10:20
…so I have to concern and try to get a sense of to her what a worry is. 

00:10:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm… hmm… 

00:10:25
And basically, the… what the lady does is basically plays… 

00:10:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm… hmm… 

00:10:30
…with a lot of toys… 

00:10:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm… hmm… 

00:10:35
…and may helps those the worries go away. 

00:10:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm… hmm… 

00:10:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB Another really important outgrowth of this initial session with the parent is that it permits the therapist to form an alliance with the parent to help the parent feel that the therapist wants to hear from them, to be in touch with them, and to include them in the child’s therapy. 

00:10:55
When Working with Parents 

00:10:55
NANCY BOYD WEBB There are several matters that should be included in the initial discussion with the parents. These are… 

00:11:05
1. Encourage their involvement 

00:11:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB First to encourage their involvement. 

00:11:05
2. Explore in detail the nature of the child’s problem 

00:11:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB Second, to explore in detail the nature of the child’s problem. 

00:11:10
3. Obtain a full developmental history of the child 

00:11:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB Third, to obtain a full development history of the child. 

00:11:15
4. Help them prepare the child for his or her first visit 

00:11:15
NANCY BOYD WEBB And fourth, to help them prepare the child for his or her first visit. 

00:11:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hi… 

00:11:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB Once the child has been prepared by the parent for the initial visit to the office, the process of play therapy begins. 

00:11:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB And you must be Natalie. Come on, let me see. How nice. Did you make it? 

00:11:40
Techniques of Play Therapy 

00:11:50
NANCY BOYD WEBB Can I go for a ride on your back? You take kids for rides? What's you say? It’s your dragon. 

00:12:00
TRAY Yes. 

00:12:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB You must answer. Yes! Oh thank you. Okay. 

00:12:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB When talking about play therapy, technique means more than simply the manipulation of materials. Far more important is the nature of the therapeutic relationship and the attitude of the therapist that facilitates open communication with the child. 

00:12:25
TRAY What’s(ph) in the home? 

00:12:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB Let's in home? Okay… 

00:12:30
TRAY Hmm… 

00:12:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB This is where he lives. 

00:12:30
TRAY Hmm… 

00:12:30
Encouraging Attitudes & Behaviors 

00:12:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB Some of these encouraging attitudes and behaviors include: 

00:12:35
Showing a positive regard and respect for the child 

00:12:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB Showing a positive regard and respect for the child… 

00:12:40
Taking a non-judgmental stance 

00:12:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB Taking a non-judgmental stance. 

00:12:45
Expressing interest in understanding the child’s feelings 

00:12:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB Expressing interest in understanding the child’s feelings. 

00:12:50
Helping the child to verbalize and clarify feelings 

00:12:50
NANCY BOYD WEBB Helping the child to verbalize and clarify feelings. 

00:12:55
Working at the child’s pace 

00:12:55
NANCY BOYD WEBB Working at the child’s pace. 

00:12:55
Presenting alternatives and choices to the child 

00:12:55
NANCY BOYD WEBB Presenting alternatives and choices to the child. 

00:13:00
Using and maintaining a sense of humor 

00:13:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB Using and maintaining a sense of humor. 

00:13:05
Joining in the child’s fantasy play 

00:13:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB Joining in the child’s fantasy play. 

00:13:05
Responding to the underlying meaning of the child’s play 

00:13:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB Responding to the underlying meaning of the child’s play. 

00:13:10
Praising positive achievements 

00:13:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB And praising positive achievements. As we explore the techniques of play therapy with these children, look for and take note of how these attitudes and behaviors are employed to encourage the children to use the materials of play therapy in ways that are meaningful and helpful to them. 

00:13:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB Oh… I’m really glad you came to see me today. 

00:13:35
NATALIE Yeah. 

00:13:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB Mummy said um… you like to do some drawings and some things like that. Yeah? 

00:13:40
NATALIE Yeah. 

00:13:40
Yeah. 

00:13:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB Natalie is not quite five years old. She came because of her mother’s concerns about her starting school and riding the school bus. Her mother feels all of these transitions and new experiences might put too much pressure on her. 

00:14:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB And I'm wonder if you could draw a family. 

00:14:00
NATALIE I can. 

00:14:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB You can? 

00:14:05
NATALIE Easy. 

00:14:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB Oh, it’s easy. 

00:14:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB One technique for finding out more about Natalie and any problem she may be experiencing is through drawings. 

00:14:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB Oh! I can hardly wait to see it. 

00:14:15
NANCY BOYD WEBB Although I have already spoken at some length with Natalie’s mother, it is important to determine if Natalie shares her mother’s concerns and whether her play will reveal that. 

00:14:25
NATALIE The feet. 

00:14:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB The feet. 

00:14:30
NATALIE The hands. 

00:14:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB Wow! And who is that? 

00:14:35
NATALIE Ah… my brother. 

00:14:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB Your brother. Okay. The first time I see a child, I usually ask them if they will be able to do some drawings and I will typically ask them to draw a person and one can learn a great deal from the manner in which the child does the figure drawing and there are all kinds of books related to analyzing children’s drawings. That is a terrific family. Mmm… we never make any assumption or conclusion based on one drawing, but they draw person is a very useful technique as is they(ph) draw a family. I also often will ask them to draw anything they want to and ah… that in and of itself is interesting, what they will select and the type of drawing they will make. 

00:15:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB Drawing activities enable the therapist to evaluate a number of aspects of a child’s development such as his or her small muscle ability, judgment about relative size, and placement of family figures, and knowledge of colors. 

00:15:50
NATALIE Red. 

00:15:50
NANCY BOYD WEBB Red. 

00:15:50
NANCY BOYD WEBB But its greatest value is an opening a window on the child’s emotional state. 

00:15:55
NATALIE You know, I’m going to draw of a colorful head. 

00:16:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm…hmm… okay. The drawings permit the child to say in a non-verbal way what they're feeling inside and they will express what they cannot say in words on a piece of paper and often just the choice of colors, the feeling tone of the drawing, whether it’s colorful, happy, or very morose. One color… 

00:16:30
NATALIE Yellow. 

00:16:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB Yellow. 

00:16:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB Can really convey a child’s inner world in a way that they could not. If you ask them how’re you feeling today? They’d say “okay.” Well, then how would you like to draw something?” And frequently after a child had said something very noncommittal about how they’re feeling, they may draw something that really suggests something very different. Let’s see who else do we have here. 

00:16:55
NATALIE The sister. 

00:17:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB The sister. 

00:17:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB After Natalie completed some drawings, I introduced a doll family letting her select which of an array of family figures she would like to include. 

00:17:10
NATALIE Ah… 

00:17:15
NANCY BOYD WEBB Could it be the grandma. 

00:17:15
NATALIE Yeah, grandpa. 

00:17:20
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm… Hmm… 

00:17:20
NANCY BOYD WEBB I wanted to see if the anxieties her mother noted would show up in her play. 

00:17:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB I’m looking to see whether she is going to convey the same kind of anxiety in regard to entering school as her mother had conveyed, because frequently, the entry to school is very anxiety producing for parents as well as children, and sometimes more so for parents than for children. 

00:17:50
NATALIE Time for breakfast. 

00:17:50
NANCY BOYD WEBB Time for breakfast, okay. 

00:17:55
NATALIE She brings it out. 

00:17:55
NANCY BOYD WEBB She brings it out and she places… 

00:17:55
NATALIE She places it on the table. 

00:18:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB And she says “Come on children, you better eat your breakfast.” 

00:18:05
NATALIE Yep. 

00:18:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB Because you’ll be going to school pretty soon. 

00:18:10
NATALIE Yep. 

00:18:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB She is moving from a rather sheltered background to one where she is going to have to ride the school bus and stay in school ah… not only for half a day, which most kindergarteners do, but… but she is going to be moving to a full day for a different program in the afternoon. The mother is very anxious about that umm… because she feels that Natalie is very young and she feels that Natalie has had some trouble with new experiences in the past. So, in the session with Natalie, I had made the decision to have a school bus available and to enact a kind of leaving for school scene to see how she would deal with that. He’s gonna come in. What’s his name? Is that Johnny? 

00:19:00
NATALIE No, my brother. 

00:19:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB That’s your brother? And what's and that is this his? Is he going to kindergarten, your brother? 

00:19:05
NATALIE No. 

00:19:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB He doesn’t go in this class. 

00:19:10
NATALIE No. 

00:19:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB No. 

00:19:10
NATALIE No. 

00:19:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB No, So why is he in there? He is gonna go in a different class for big boys. 

00:19:15
NATALIE Ah, yeah. 

00:19:20
NANCY BOYD WEBB She was able to very fully engage in the process of going to school, but the one thing that did come up umm… in her play was the repeated references to an older sibling being with her and being with another child friend ah… in her classroom with her both on the bus and in the classroom. Now, Natalie’s older brother is nine years old and there’s no way he’s gonna be spending the day in kindergarten, so this was the one place where I noticed in her play that she maybe feeling some anxiety. 

00:20:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB To play out a going-to-school scenario, a combination of the school bus, family dolls, and blocks were offered to Natalie. 

00:20:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB Let’s see what they’re gonna say to their teacher. 

00:20:10
NATALIE Hi. 

00:20:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hi. And what’s the teacher going to say to them? 

00:20:15
NATALIE Hi. 

00:20:15
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hi, I’m glad you came to school today. We have lots of fun things to do. 

00:20:20
NANCY BOYD WEBB Blocks are a useful play therapy medium, because the child can create an environment that is important to him or her and imbue in with meaning. 

00:20:30
NATALIE Anne, here comes brother. 

00:20:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB Okay, Natalie and Danny. 

00:20:35
NATALIE My brother just coming to visit. 

00:20:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB Yeah, he's just coming to visit. 

00:20:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB In Natalie’s case, she sets about constructing her imagined future school setting including classrooms and playground. Being able to make her way successfully through this created environment will hopefully enable her to make a positive adjustment to the actual school experience. 

00:21:00
NATALIE She didn't (inaudible ) now. 

00:21:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB That’s good… I feel that the session with her was not only helped with my assessment of the situation, but it also was therapeutic for her because she, we were able to enact the leaving from home, the going to school, and the return home in a way that ah… I think she will be able to remember and talk about with her mother, and her mother also I think will feel good about Natalie’s ability to involve herself in this kind of play. We made a very nice going to school and coming back from school story. 

00:21:45
NATALIE Yeah. 

00:21:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB Did you like it? 

00:21:45
NATALIE Yeah. 

00:21:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB What do you think it will be? Do you think it will be good like that when you go? 

00:21:50
NATALIE Yeah. 

00:21:50
NANCY BOYD WEBB Natalie’s initial visit provides an example of a very positive beginning to therapy, but that is not always the case with such a young person. 

00:22:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB Can you draw a person? No? Will you draw whatever you want to? One never knows how a particular child is going to respond to a new situation. Tray has had a lot of experience in full-time daycare since his mother works and his mother had told me that he engages very easily and he is a very verbal child. That in fact was not true. He was not happy to be here and really wanted to go. Can you make a circle? 

00:22:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB I was asked to evaluate Tray, because he had been acting very aggressively toward other family members and in his daycare program. Because his demeanor was in contrast to the background information his mother provided, I was not sure what to expect from him in terms of his interest in play. 

00:23:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm… You don’t want to draw, uh? 

00:23:00
TRAY Hmm… Hmm… I don’t wanna do nothing. 

00:23:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB You don’t wanna do nothing. You can never really predict how a child will behave and it’s important to have a variety of materials available because if they’re not interested in doing one activity, ah… you may, they may become interested in another. Do you know how to use scissors? You do? 

00:23:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB Sometimes it is difficult to engage the child in play. This may be related to the child’s anxiety about being with a stranger or it may be relate to the child’s developmental immaturity, which could make it difficult for the child to focus. 

00:23:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB You wanna cut my picture? 

00:23:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB In situations like this, the therapist can suggest a number of alternatives until the child comfortably settles into one activity. 

00:23:55
NANCY BOYD WEBB I thought he might like to draw. He was not interested at all. Very good. We attempted some cutting activities. He was more interested in that. We then moved into play dough, which really he enjoyed, and he was able to act out some of his, ah… I think, conflicts through the play dough whereas it had not, there had not been any evidence of anything earlier than that. 

00:24:25
TRAY Look what I made. 

00:24:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB Oh, what is it? 

00:24:25
TRAY I don’t know. 

00:24:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB It could be anything you want. 

00:24:30
TRAY It’s a dragon. 

00:24:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB It looks like a dragon. And what’s the dragon gonna do? Is he gonna come and see this person? 

00:24:35
TRAY Yes. 

00:24:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB And what’s he gonna do with this person? 

00:24:40
TRAY Eat it up. 

00:24:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB Eat it up. 

00:24:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB Plastic materials like play dough and clay provide a rich opportunity for younger children like Tray to communicate feelings they cannot verbalize. 

00:24:55
NANCY BOYD WEBB Here comes the dragon. Oh, poor person. 

00:25:00
TRAY He ate them up… 

00:25:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB He ate them all. 

00:25:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB As with drawing, plastic materials have no inherent structure that might suggest specific forms or outcomes. By offering them without instruction, the therapist allows the child to use his own imagination to project his emotions on to the play material. 

00:25:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB Is this, is this a little boy or a little girl? 

00:25:25
TRAY A little boy. 

00:25:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB Here’s a little boy. 

00:25:30
TRAY That’s the mama. 

00:25:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB And here’s the mama. We always look for themes and the themes in his play dough activity were those of ah… the little boy being hurt, being eaten up, being attacked. 

00:25:45
TRAY He ate them up. 

00:25:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB He… 

00:25:45
TRAY He ate this one up. 

00:25:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB He ate this one up. Those look as if he is feeling very small and vulnerable and not too safe in his world. Now, I would never jump to that conclusion based on 20 minutes of playing with play dough, but I would wanna see him a second and a third time and see what happens next time. Certainly, he moved from being a child who didn’t wanna be in the room at all to one who really wanted to stay. So, I would expect a second and a third time he would participate much more fully. This one goes with the rest of the red. 

00:26:25
TRAY Put the red in. 

00:26:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB Yeah. 

00:26:25
TRAY I’m silly. 

00:26:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB Why? Why is it silly? 

00:26:30
TRAY Because I’m funny and very silly. 

00:26:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB You’re very silly and funny. 

00:26:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB During these initial visits, what has the appearance of an emotional problem may be the result of other factors. In Tray’s case, his reluctance to engage may have been developmental in nature. With other children such as Willy, social or cultural factors may be operative. 

00:27:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB Maybe you could start by drawing a person. You… I saw you draw that other picture. Willy's play was quite constricted. Ah… by that I mean although he said he loves to draw that I asked him… his one… some of his favorite activities, ah… and he mentioned drawing right away. He instead of selecting something spontaneous to draw, he chose to copy the cover of the marker box. It was in fact meticulously executed and I think he was proud of it. Hmm…, looks just like him. However, it’s interesting to note that he does not show his feelings of pride and when he’s complimented, does not seem to respond. He has a rather flat affect and again, I’m a stranger and it’s a strange situation, so I've no way of knowing whether his response is typical or whether umm… he is guarded because he doesn’t know me as most children are in the early sessions. 

00:28:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB Willy spent at least ten minutes making his drawing. He was nonverbal and responded only minimally to my questions and comments as he drew. 

00:28:20
NANCY BOYD WEBB You’re not in the same house anymore. Is that right? 

00:28:25
WILLY I'm in the same house. 

00:28:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB You are? Ah… Hah… You gonna stay here today? Yeah. 

00:28:30
WILLY I’m gonna stay there. I'm gonna to stay there. 

00:28:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB You wanna gonna stay here. Okay, that’s good. I knew you had to go someplace today. 

00:28:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB I believe it was important to move at his pace and wait patiently until he finished. This patience hopefully demonstrated to Willy my respect for how important it was for him to complete his drawing. After the very slow and controlled drawing activity, Willy evidently felt comfortable enough to spontaneously ask if he could play with the puppets. 

00:29:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB He certainly warmed up tremendously when we started with the puppets and he very eagerly involved himself with umm… some of the puppet play involving a lion and some family figures and had the lion attack them. The lion’s big and he’s strong. And what is the man gonna do? I don’t think he showed a lot of emotion during the play, although some rather scary things were happening, and this is one of the things that the play therapist would observe and take note of. In… does the child’s emotional expression match what they are playing out, and if not, you know what could this mean, as he afraid to show his feelings for some reason? They’re jumping on the lion, oh. 

00:30:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB The successful use of puppets relies on the ability of the child to make some form of identification with the characters. 

00:30:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB You wanna be the lion? No? Okay. Is the lion going to run away again? 

00:30:20
NANCY BOYD WEBB This type of play then allows the child and therapist to talk about feelings and emotions that belong to the puppet rather than to the child. 

00:30:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB They’re clapping their hands. Maybe they can hug each other. Ooh, because they are proud of themselves and they’re happy. 

00:30:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB This makes the communication more open since the child is not required to take ownership of the problem. 

00:30:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB They’re very happy, hmm. Hello! Is anybody home? You think anyone’s home? I know you were peeking through the window. Who is home in this house today? 

00:31:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB Another technique of symbolic play is the use of dolls. 

00:31:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB And who is that? 

00:31:05
WILLY The sister. 

00:31:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB The sister. 

00:31:10
WILLY And the other sister. 

00:31:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB Other sister. 

00:31:10
WILLY And the mother. 

00:31:15
NANCY BOYD WEBB Although older boys like Willy have been socialized to think of dolls as girl toys, he was willing to use family figures to express his feelings. 

00:31:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB Willy is a child who has been in foster care. He is currently in residential care and the most poignant part of his play comes at the end when he does, ah… I do introduce a doll house ah… with some little family figures and doll house furniture, and he puts them all in one room and wants to keep them all in that room as if that is the secure place. So, do they all, they like to be in the same room all together? 

00:32:00
WILLY And they’re still together. 

00:32:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB They are still together. And I subsequently learned that in fact his family lives in one room and his concluding statement is they're all still together, and I do think that this was his fantasy and his wish for himself and he really wants to be reunited with his family, which would be a very understandable wish and he was able to express this in his play and finally in words in a displaced way through use of the dollhouse. 

00:32:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB Even though these initial encounters are essentially evaluation sessions, a great deal of information can be extracted from them that is important to identify and review. 

00:32:45
Initial Evaluation Information Does the child’s developmental stage and ability seem age appropriate? 

00:32:50
NANCY BOYD WEBB For example, does the child’s developmental stage and ability seem age appropriate? 

00:32:55
Is there any sign of separation anxiety? 

00:32:55
NANCY BOYD WEBB Is there any sign of separation anxiety? 

00:33:00
How well does the child relate to the therapist? 

00:33:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB How well does the child relate to the therapist? 

00:33:00
How well does the child focus on an activity? 

00:33:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB How well does the child focus on an activity? 

00:33:05
Is the quality of the play creative or constrictive? 

00:33:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB Is the quality of the play creative or constrictive? 

00:33:10
Is the play age appropriate? 

00:33:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB Is the play age appropriate? 

00:33:10
Are there any significant themes which may indicate possible areas of conflict? 

00:33:15
NANCY BOYD WEBB And finally, are there any significant themes that arise, which may indicate possible areas of conflict? 

00:33:25
Play Therapy in Follow-Up Sessions 

00:33:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB The techniques of play therapy are also essential in follow-up sessions. These sessions are like periodic checkups after a period of treatment has been successfully concluded. The purpose is to see how the child is faring in meeting new circumstances and challenges. Such is the case with Katy. 

00:33:55
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hi, Katy. I haven’t seen you for a while. Remember, umm… when you used to come here? 

00:34:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB Katy is almost eight years old. I had not seen her for six months. Originally, Katy came to me because she was experiencing some social awkwardness among her peers and conflicts with her siblings. 

00:34:15
NANCY BOYD WEBB And this was the third one when you made all these paper plates and I even have a few. 

00:34:20
NANCY BOYD WEBB One of the play activities Katy enjoyed was making faces on paper plates. 

00:34:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB You took some home too. 

00:34:30
KATY I took. 

00:34:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB Because I realized that she enjoyed it and that it seem to be meaningful to her, I started taking Polaroid pictures of her drawings ah… so that in the event that she won't decided to take the masks home, I would've a record of them for my own files, and that is important when you’re seeing a child in treatment to be able to save some of their work or to see examples from the early phase of treatment and to compare them with later drawings that they may do. 

00:35:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB I remembered Katy’s interest in this activity and used it here since it held some significance to her in her past. 

00:35:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB Is this gonna be a surprise or you’re gonna tell me about it? 

00:35:15
NANCY BOYD WEBB This is an example of a child focusing on a technique, because it serves a psychological purpose. 

00:35:20
NANCY BOYD WEBB It’s a face, a little face. 

00:35:25
KATY A little face. 

00:35:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB A little face of a little person? 

00:35:30
KATY Little person. 

00:35:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB I do believe that this child had difficulty with her own sense of who she was and how she looked and the drawing of the mask-like face enabled her to experiment with different kinds of expressions and different kinds of feelings and occasionally, she would put different figures on the masks. You get to go first. Oh, one. 

00:36:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB Another play therapy technique that is interesting to a child of Katy’s age is the use of board games. 

00:36:05
KATY What is one of this. 

00:36:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB Read it loud so I can hear. Even in playing a board game with a child it may look to the uninitiated observer as if the therapist is just playing a board game. The conversation that goes on during the game and around the feelings of the child ah… is really very important. 

00:36:30
KATY What is the worst thing you can do to someone? 

00:36:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB The worst thing you can do to someone? 

00:36:35
KATY Break up friendship. 

00:36:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB Break up a friendship. Yeah, did that ever happen to you? The talking feeling, doing game is a, is a board game that involves structured activities with cards indicating requirements to respond in a talking manner to a feeling, with a feeling response or in a doing manner. The players roll a dice and move a piece around a board and depending on whether the piece lands on white, yellow, or red spot, the corresponding color card is chosen and players alternate, and they've to respond to what the instructions are on the card. Tell about something you did that made you feel good about yourself. Unless you set it up ahead of time, you never know what the cards are going to be, and I did not set it up ahead of time. So one of the significant cards that Katy got was “what’s the worst thing you can say about another person?” 

00:37:45
KATY Saying they’re stupid. 

00:37:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB If someone said they were stupid. What else? That’s one. If they said what? 

00:37:55
KATY Saying they didn’t know anything. 

00:38:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB If they’re, If they’re, If they’re dumb or they didn’t know anything, and what else? 

00:38:05
KATY Weird. 

00:38:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB That they’re weird. Okay. These I think were adjectives that she was, may have been afraid that other kids had applied to her in the past and so we, I used the therapeutic moment there and this is an example of therapy during play to umm… help her figure out what she could say back in a situation like that. What would you like say back to her? 

00:38:35
KATY That, that he(ph) was meaning(ph). 

00:38:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB You’re mean and I'm not stupid and goodbye. I don’t like you. How is that? Is that good? Could you say that? 

00:38:50
KATY You’re mean and I don’t like you, I don't know (inaudible ). 

00:38:56
NANCY BOYD WEBB I wanted her to repeat back an assertive statement that would indicate that she feels okay about herself and that those things should not really apply to her at all and so I felt that the session did give that opportunity. Do you remember when you used to tell me about sometimes you lose your temper. 

00:39:20
KATY Hmm… get mad a lot. 

00:39:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB You get mad. 

00:39:25
KATY Hmm…hmm… 

00:39:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB Yeah, does that still happen sometimes? 

00:39:30
KATY Hmm…Hmm… not mostly. 

00:39:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB Not mostly. So you’re, you, you're getting older or you’re controlling it better or what? 

00:39:35
KATY I’m controlling it. 

00:39:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB Good, congratulations. I’m proud of you. I think it was an interesting session for her and I hope helpful in addition to umm… giving me a chance to see how she is managing in a follow-up. 

00:39:55
NANCY BOYD WEBB By the time a child reaches the age of 12 like Joanna, he or she is much more comfortable with and capable of expressing his or her feelings verbally. 

00:40:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB Yeah. Remember the reason why we started to meeting together? 

00:40:10
JOANNA Yeah, it was first my parents separated, and my dad moved out. 

00:40:15
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm…Hmm… 

00:40:15
JOANNA …and then uncle died. 

00:40:20
NANCY BOYD WEBB Yes, you had a rather…. 

00:40:20
JOANNA When matters got the worst. 

00:40:20
NANCY BOYD WEBB That was a rough year. 

00:40:25
JOANNA Yeah, it was, it was pretty bad. 

00:40:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB Joanna came to me several years ago in the throes of a real crisis in her life. I was also seeing her sister who was two years older. 

00:40:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB Yeah, I remember you and your sister used to come together sometimes. 

00:40:40
JOANNA Yeah. 

00:40:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB And what… when it was so hard, do you remember what it was like and how you used to react? 

00:40:50
JOANNA Yeah. 

00:40:50
NANCY BOYD WEBB Joanna and her sister in response to both of these events were fighting with each other in an extreme way and so the focus of Joanna’s therapy was to help her learn ways to manage her anger. 

00:41:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB Joanna represents the child who can both talk and play, but for whom at age eight and nine talking would not have been adequate to have helped her. So we had used clay. 

00:41:20
NANCY BOYD WEBB Clay like play dough, provides the child with a lot of choice about how to use the material to express feelings, and since the clay has to be worked vigorously, it has the secondary benefit of providing a physical outlet for feelings of anger. 

00:41:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB I know why we used to do this together, but I don’t know if I told you. I used to think that, you know, if you having feeling angry, that when you do this, you know it’s a good way to get your tension released. We had used clay very productively because she would really work on it and clay is a wonderful releaser of tension. Joanna had been very interested in pottery in school and she had actually made some pinch pots that won awards. So she was very interested in using the medium for an artistic expression outside of therapy, but we utilized it extensively in therapy to help her ventilate and get release from her feelings of anger. 

00:42:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB Joanna’s life was very complicated and confusing to her, but over the course of two years, she was able to make great strides in coping with the circumstances that were making her so angry, issues I wanted to review with her once again. 

00:42:50
NANCY BOYD WEBB So did you tell your mom about your fight with your sister? or did you not want to tell her because she was sick? 

00:42:55
JOANNA Oh… ha… ha… the stupid thing that we always did which was why we stopped as we called her and we have a fight… 

00:43:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB Oh… 

00:43:00
JOANNA And upset her. 

00:43:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm…Hmm… but you're trying to get her to help you. 

00:43:05
JOANNA Yeah. 

00:43:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB Stop it probably. 

00:43:10
JOANNA Right, hmm… hmm… 

00:43:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB This follow-up session was dramatically different than our earlier ones. Instead of an angry, confused girl, I found a confident, preadolescent with a much more positive outlook on her life. 

00:43:25
NANCY BOYD WEBB She obviously has gone beyond the frustration level that she used to umm… have and she reports being very happy in her present life in having had only one fight with her sister during the past year. Are you making a sun? That’s nice. It’s very creative. The card game I played with Joanna was one we had played in the past therapy sessions. It’s called the feelings in hand and it's, it umm… provides the opportunity again to you to have a structured way to talk about feelings with a child in a way that’s fun for them and that they enjoy. It’s basically like playing a game of fish except that instead of collecting numbers or suites, one is collecting feelings of a variety of ah… of emotions such as jealousy, hate, sad, angry, the whole range of feelings. 

00:44:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB In the process of playing, there is the opportunity to discuss with the child different alternatives to handling various emotions. This is valuable for children who have trouble identifying or managing their feelings. 

00:44:50
JOANNA And do you have any ashamed? 

00:44:50
NANCY BOYD WEBB I think so, yeah one. Okay. 

00:44:55
JOANNA okay, I felt ashamed when we called our mom in the hospital, she was sick and we upset her. 

00:45:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm… hmm… Okay.. 

00:45:05
JOANNA I really… 

00:45:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB Well. 

00:45:05
JOANNA Very bad. 

00:45:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm…hmm… 

00:45:05
JOANNA Ashamed. 

00:45:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB But I’m sure she’s forgiven you for that. 

00:45:10
JOANNA I hope so. 

00:45:10
NANCY BOYD WEBB You’re gonna have to ask her on the way. 

00:45:15
JOANNA She could turn around… she could turn around someday. 

00:45:15
NANCY BOYD WEBB I don’t think exactly… 

00:45:20
JOANNA (inaudible ) 

00:45:21
NANCY BOYD WEBB The particular feelings that Joanna identified with regard to ashamed was being ashamed at calling her mother in who has been in the hospital at the time that she had a fight with her sister. So there is still a lot of feelings around that she shouldn’t ever fight with her sister and that, you know, it’s really not acceptable way to handle her feelings. And umm… the other thing she mentioned in the card game was with regard to feeling sad when her uncle died. 

00:45:50
JOANNA I’m just kind of sad. 

00:45:55
NANCY BOYD WEBB Oh. 

00:45:55
JOANNA I was sad when my uncle died. 

00:46:00
NANCY BOYD WEBB Hmm…Hmm… the two issues that she originally came about, which were her anger around her parents’ divorce and her uncle’s death are still with her, and of course therapy never completes anything. I mean that they always will be with her, but she is doing very well with her life and she is able to talk about it and put those things in her past for the most part. 

00:46:20
NANCY BOYD WEBB Follow-up sessions on a regular basis provide an opportunity to see how well the child is maintaining the gains initially achieved during therapy. 

00:46:30
Follow-Up Session Information 

00:46:35
NANCY BOYD WEBB Some of the questions that should be addressed in these follow-up sessions include the following: 

00:46:40
How is the child progressing from a developmental standpoint? 

00:46:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB How is the child progressing from a developmental standpoint? 

00:46:40
What is the child’s degree of comfort with the therapist? 

00:46:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB What is the child’s degree of comfort with the therapist? 

00:46:45
Does the child have a realistic sense of his or her life? 

00:46:45
NANCY BOYD WEBB Does the child have a realistic sense of his or her life? That is a view which is neither too idealistic or too negative. 

00:46:55
Does the child have a sense of achievement about overcoming past problems? 

00:46:55
NANCY BOYD WEBB Does the child have a sense of achievement about overcoming past problems which led to therapy? 

00:47:00
Have the dual goals of therapy been maintained? 

00:47:05
NANCY BOYD WEBB And finally, have the dual goals of therapy been maintained? That is of the problems which help was sought and brought under control and does the child’s development seem to be progressing normally. Play therapy is simple and it is complex. While it is easy to see the play part of play therapy, it is not as easy to see the therapy part. 

00:47:30
NANCY BOYD WEBB Play therapy is the treatment of choice with children under 12 years of age in my opinion. Ah… it provides the opportunity to communicate with the child in the language in which they are comfortable. It umm… helps them feel understood in a nonverbal way and it also provides them with interest and entertainment and if you think about it, children aren’t gonna wanna come back, keep coming back for therapy if it’s not something that they’re enjoying and getting some pleasure from. So, play therapy meets the child at the child’s level of communication and it also does provide the opportunity for the gradual learning of feelings, learning the names of feelings through the process of talking with the therapist as they would be… as the play is evolving. 

00:48:40
NANCY BOYD WEBB Sometimes therapists working with children do not have access to a fully equipped playroom office. Fortunately, many of the play materials and supplies are easily transportable, for example, in a large canvas tote bag. The portable playroom enables the therapist to bring the materials of play therapy to the child when necessary.
