JANINA FISHER Have you noticed that many of your most stuck, most embattled couples uh… one or both have a history of trauma, neglect, and… and those are often the ones who are hardest to help, umm… because of the way the trauma affects the attachment system, right. Attachment is not just meant to make us feel safe, feel loved. It's also meant to protect us against danger that is really the evolutionary purpose of attachment. But when the parents when the attachment figure is the danger, Wow, a little feedback there, sorry about that. What happens is the kids are caught in a bind. They have the same yearning that any child has to be held, to be comforted, to be loved, but the person to whom they want to flee is also the person who's hurting them. And so the source of safety instinctively is actually the source of danger and that sets up a terrible… terrible conflict, a longing to be safely loved, coupled with fear, hyper-vigilance, and a quickness to fighting and flee. Now one of the things that… that most of us were not trained uh… to know is that the nervous system, our autonomic nervous system, which drives all of our emotions, all of our actions, the autonomic nervous system develops in the context of attachment. So failed attachment failure leaves lifelong affects on the nervous system and… and by the way this is one of the things that my clients are very familiar with you'll… you'll see this is a very… very simple way of representing the nervous system and it's deliberately simple, because we want clients to understand. I explained to them that they have bodies capable of high activation, ready to leap tall buildings at a single bound, to run for miles, to fight off an attacker twice as big as you are, and they also have a parasympathetic system, a system that allows us to have very low activation, as in a medically induced coma. And… and we need… Sorry, we're having up some trouble here? 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN I'm yes. 

00:03:50
JANINA FISHER Yeah, could we… 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

00:04:00
JANINA FISHER Okay. All right, I'm gonna look at you guys on the size with my peripheral… Okay. I'm… My eyes will roam, my head will stay straight. So am I explaining that most of the time our… our nervous system activation fluctuates within what Dan Siegel calls the "Window of tolerance," what Pat Ogden calls the "Optimal arousal zone." And… and that by the way represents bandwidth not… not kind of Zen like calm. You want a window of tolerance that allows you to tolerate intense anger, intense hurt and sadness, but also allows you to tolerate feeling disconnected, bored, tired and… and allow you to think and feel at the same time. And when I first used that language with my clients they said "Really, people think and feel at the same time, really." But, you know, all of our psychotherapy methods are based on the assumption that people can think and feel at the same time. So here's how you get that wide window of tolerance. When you're very… very… very upset, uh… when you're bored, tired, lonely, sad, someone picks you up, comforts you, hold you, uh… makes you laugh, and restores your little body to that optimal state. And… And even when that happens day in, and day out, those of you in the room who are parents know how hard it is to provide this, this is not easy. Uh… And if your children are still young each time you do it, think I'm building my child's window of tolerance. I'm its testing my window of tolerance, but I'm building his or her window of tolerance. Now when a parent is frightening something very different happens. There is no opportunity for the window of tolerance to expand, because that's dependent on good attachment. Instead, children are in… who live in chronic states of high arousal, fear, readiness to flee or fight, impulsive, quick to anger, quick to reactivity. One of my pet peeves I have to say is that these children get diagnosed oppositional defiant, which seems like a very cruel punishment on top of whatever environmental cause of their nervous system being so dysregulated. And this group, the parasympathetic group, the kids who give up and just endure in a disconnected state, going through emotions, not able to care about anything. Can you see how self protective, how the nervous system protects children who have to endure and tell they can leave and so if you have to endure years and years and years of abuse, uh… doing it in a parasympathetic state makes it more viable. Unfortunately, this young man, Oh, I can't turn my head, I forget… This young man at the bottom, first he gets diagnosed as underachieving as a kid, having no motivation, not working hard enough, and then years later in… in a relationship or in couples therapy, he gets labeled avoidant and we have to remember that avoidance is not a choice that it's a function of whether your nervous system allows you to connect to your feelings whether your feelings are like a tsunami or whether your feelings exist in some other plane that you can connect to. Our researchers for 30 years have studied an organization… Attachment style that was labeled first type D or disorganized attachment and what researchers noted was that children, one year old children with this attachment style had parents, mothers, because most attachment researchers on mothers who were either frightening or appeared frightened. And the researchers noticed that when mothers appeared frightened, the children looked frightened. Of course, when the mothers appeared frightening, the children were frightened. And… And what happened then whether, you know, the beauty of this research is that it says you don't have to lay a hand on a child in order to traumatize that child, in order to frighten that child, make that child feel that life is at risk, because after all how do children know they're going to live, how do they know they're not going to be killed. Judy Hammond writes at the moment of the trauma, at the moment that a parent is frightening, the child is utterly helpless, unable to defend herself, she cries for help, but no one comes to her aid. The memory of this experience pervades… Excuse me… All subsequent relationships. The greater the child's emotional conviction of helplessness and abandonment, the more desperately she feels the need for an omnipotent rescuer. But because she feels as if her life depends on her rescuer, she cannot afford to be tolerant. There is no room for human error. Think about the clients that… that describes. And…. And all… And the clients whom you have tried to help, to be able to tolerate the failure of the partner to be there when he or she needs them. So this is what we call an implicit or feeling memory. The desperate need for somebody to get it, for somebody to be there, and a sense that he or she cannot afford to tolerate the slightest disappointment. So traumatic attachment creates in the body and mind, an unspoken question, is it really safe to be attacked, right. If our parents offer us some degree of safety, it only has to be good enough. Uh… We have… We grew up with this felt sense that it's safe to be close to people. And it's also safe to be by ourselves. When we're exposed to danger, it exacerbates the impulses to connect the sense of a desperate need to connect, but it also increases the impulses to flee or fight. And again often unconscious, it's the… it's the body that says no… no, don't let him in, don't trust her, it isn't safe, keep a safe distance, keep your mouth shut, and make sure he knows how you feel, uh… because otherwise uh… you are in danger. Now one of the things that brain scan has researchers taught us is that we don't remember trauma as an event, we don't create a narrative as much as we encode physical and emotional memories. Uh… We think that was an evolutionary uh… uh… development, because it was safer if you were a cave man or a woman to have the sense of danger in your body, so you didn't have to think. Umm… and let's see what… what kind of animals do I have to look out for, if I walk outside the cave, is not as efficient as putting a foot outside the cave and having your body begin to freeze and look very carefully around. So when we remember trauma with our feelings and our bodies, we're more vigilant, we're more attuned to danger cues, but we don't know we're remembering. You know, when you remember, oh, when I was five such and such happened or like couples do, you always say that. You know, when we remember verbally and narratively, it feels like we're remembering. When we have a sudden feeling, a fear, a sudden feeling of terrible searing hurt, we don't know that it might be memory. As Dan Segal says "Non-verbal memories do not carry with them. The internal sensation that something is being recalled." And so often our couples fight over non-verbal implicit memories, right. Their responses to each other are driven by the nonverbal memories they trigger in each other. This phenomenon of triggers and triggering, you know, we've been talking in the trauma field for 30 years about triggers. Uh… And then when we have neuroscience research to say "Oh, yes, the body becomes sensitized to stimuli that bear any relationship uh… distant or identical to the original danger." And… And because these are non-verbal memories, we don't know that what's being stimulated is memory. And when non-verbal implicit memories are stimulated and they're stimulated now over the breakfast table, they're stimulated while talking about who's gonna take out of the track, who got the trash, in that moment it feels like the other person is the threat. Right, the body is saying danger… danger, red alert and… And there's nothing happening that tells us "Oh, you're remembering" that refusal of your husband to take out the trash is triggering he implicit memories of the parents who didn't do their jobs and as a result it wasn't safe. So implicit traumatic memories are not always straightforward, sometimes as you all know it's a very… very clear connection, but sometimes its not. Sometimes the feelings of desperation, despair the impulses I'm out of here that many couples have, those can always be implicit memories. I think the I'm out of here, forget it, its over. I… I think those are generally implicit memories. Uh… A feeling, a minimized feeling invisible, feeling powerless, helpless, shamed, those are often implicit memories. And all kinds of body sensations that your clients may or may not be aware of uh… a look crosses the face of the other and the client's body goes Uh! Or goes Uh! There we go again. And again how would your client know its memory. Here's the other complication, we have the same defensive responses to danger, as any other mammal. We're better at crying for help, because we have words, we're not so good at fighting, unless we have weapons unfortunately, umm… we're not as good at fleeing, but we flee, uh… we can freeze and try to become invisible, and we submit and play dead. In human terms it might be described as I floated up to the ceiling, I pretended to be asleep, I just shut down and I couldn't talk. And each individual develops a particular pattern of nervous system reactivity geared to adapt to the early attachment environment, now brought into the marriage. I used to joke, sometimes I told my couples this, "I say, you know, the marriage ceremony should include I take you and your history and your unresolved issues," right. Because otherwise suddenly we get married in this bliss of euphoria, turn around and look at who we married and say, Ewe! right. Right, and depending on our nervous systems, we're gonna be more likely to react to some things rather than others. So some individuals develop a pattern of sympathetic hyper-arousal symptoms, uh… they are impulsive, they're quick to anger, they're quick to tears, uh… they are hyper-vigilant, they have, what I call post-traumatic paranoia, which is a kind of chronic suspiciousness. You don't think about… about couples in which one partner is always certain, the other is cheating, right. And… And, you know, if there's a… a factual basis for that fear that's… that's different when there is actually no data that suggests it to be true, but there is a conviction no… no, I know she or he is cheating calmly. Uh… Flashbacks, nightmares, a tendency to obsessing and ruminating cognitive schemas about danger or about worthlessness. And then we have some clients who develop chronic hyper-arousal patterns, they're numb, they're flat, they're shut down. Uh… Their thinking is slow, their access to verbal information, even you know, I don't have to tell you guys, but, you know, our… our hyper-arousal client comes in and starts talking a mile a minute, its like machine gun fire, right. And the other client can maybe get two words out. Umm… the hypo-arousal client tends to have no energy. You know, if you think about a medically induced coma, the point is that we don't move. The parasympathetic system is designed to stop us from action. So the hyper-arousal spouse says "Say something, see he doesn't care, look at him he can't even say a word," right. And his brain is processing like this and maybe if there were space and time a word or two would come, but in that moment that he's kind of a deer in the headlights, the words don't come and… and then he gets labeled avoided uh… or she, because if it is not uh… just a male gender phenomenon. Julie Herman writes "When neither resistance nor escape is possible." the human system of self-defense becomes overwhelmed and disorganized. Each component of the ordinary response to danger having lost its utility tends to persist in an altered and exaggerated state. So again think about the couples you see, think about the couples whose… whose survival response is always fight, but it's all (inaudible) exaggerated, it's not adaptive anymore. Uh… Think about the clients who shut down or the clients who say "I'm out of here, I'm not doing this." These are ordinary responses to danger that are now altered and exaggerated. And… and what happens is that the wish to or the really the instinct to attach becomes… becomes to coexist and to conflict with defensive responses. So you have some clients who are chronically oriented to danger, right. Always looking for the signs that she doesn't care, that she's cheating, that he uh… doesn't get or doesn't love her. There's some, they're expecting the worst, is a classic trauma related uh… defensive response. Uh… I don't have to tell couples therapist about flight or fight responses, you know, all about those for sure. But what you may not know is that as a subset of the fight response comes self judgment, right. So you have the… the fighters, who judge the partner and then you have the fight response turned against the self. Uh… Chronic despair and self loathing is part of the submission response. You know, I see this when… when both partners agree that one is at fault, don't you hear that. You know, I'm much more comfortable when they're duking it out, "no, it's her fault, no, it's his fault." Uh… When they both agree that one is the problem that makes me actually much more concerned. And often there is, you know, the cry for help is a very important animal defence. Baby… It's the baby's first defence, you know, all animals make noises to single members of the species that they're in trouble. So that defensive response can be altered and exaggerated also. So some of our couples uh… Some members of our couples are chronically searching for the person to love them in the right way, but the right one has never there, because they're driven by memory, driven by that… that impulse I've got to find somebody to take care of for me, to keep me safe. Now don’t you go… need of the wonderful… I always say that relationships are not for sissies. I'm very clear with couples upfront. You know, this is tough, but relationships are not for sissies, uh… which is really a challenge to their belief, this should be easier. He or she should get me, he or she should be able to compromise. Umm… I'm clear that actually that's not part of human nature. So when the… When partners uh… behave in ways that maybe clearly within normal limits, but they're triggering, those moments get interpreted by the body as danger signals. You know, when he says "I'm not you're, you know, I'm not your house boy, I don't have to take out the trash." Uh… And that feels like a parent who says I don't have to take care of you, right. It there isn't… uh… there isn't any reality testing possible, because the memory of some of the attachment failure is so emotionally powerful that it's hard to have any perspective. And the client feels "I'm all alone with no help, with somebody who doesn't care." And that's the memory that was true. So traumatic attachment in adults looks like this, see if you recognize it in your client's. Uh… A nervous system that is chronically dysregulated, clients alternating between uh… hyper-reactive responses and hypo-shut off responses, proximity alternating with fleeing and fighting. Internal conflicts about closeness and distance. Uh… It's amazing how… how right we all know this. Uh… One says you're too far away, right. The other comes toward "Oh, now you're too close," right and vice versa or this one who's approach says this is getting really uncomfortable and I don't like being demanded to be closer, right. Because think of that parallel trauma, there's a demand. You have to behave in a certain way or else. Clients with trauma histories have huge deficits in object permanence and object constancy, and that too is part of what makes relationships so triggering. Here's the classic paradigm of disorganized detachment. I don't wanna treat you like dirt, but I don't wanna lose you either, right. You know, there are very few people who want to treat the other person like dirt. Lots of people who don't wanna lose the other person, right. And that so often the dilemma our embattled couples are in, right. They're treating each other like dirt, but they don't wanna lose each now. Now there were two flavors of disorganized or traumatic attachment that it's good to know about. The first is disorganized or traumatic attachment with preoccupied tendencies that describes people who are very outgoing, they make relationships easy, they can approach even pursue, but they are hyper-vigilant and on guard. So they can get close quickly, but they're quickly triggered to feeling in danger, neglected, invisible. Uh… And… And so their relationships tend to be very… very tumultuous. Then we have another flavor of traumatic attachment. This… the client yearns for closeness, but keeps a safe distance. There the longing is there as opposed to the attachment style called dismissing, where there is no longing, where there is avoidance without yearning. This attachment style, the avoidance partner yearns for closeness, but… but keeps an emotional distance and often a physical distance. And often keeps the therapist at bay too, right, which is difficult for us. And we have to be very careful with that… with that second type of disorganized attachment, because if we start to feel that this person, you know, when… when we start to label the person who doesn't feel and doesn't express uh… as… as the problem, when we… when we start to try to pull the feelings out of that uh… individual, they become more avoidant and they really do best when the therapist says "Well, of course… of course, she would keep your feelings close to your chest." Do you even feel them? I mean, I… I wanna know it's it often these are clients who don't feel their feelings. It isn't that they're feeling them and refusing to express them, they actually don't feel. So here's the first, "Honey, I got you some flowers to complain about." I need say no more. And the latter "my preference is for someone who's afraid of closeness like me." But she knows the thing that's so sad is. These two people married each other, these two people came together, and they've… they've been duking it out ever since. Now part of the problem and that's what we're going to explore in the workshop I'm doing uh… called "Beyond Words" is that when your memories are non-verbal, when your responses to the other reflex trauma as encoded in emotional and physical reactions, words can't really do justice to it. It doesn't… You know, the couples in which it doesn't work to try to… to talk about it, right. I mean, I've had couples where I've said "No, we're not talking about any issues. You guys can't even talk about the weather without fighting." So we can't address issues. And they say "We're in therapy, you're supposed to help us address the issues." And I say "I would love to help you address the issues." But first, I have to teach you how to have a conversation. Uh… And because each time they try to have a conversation in words, the emotional and body responses immediately turn into conflict. I mean, you… you know, the couples, one says "It's a nice day," the other says "What do you mean, it's cloudy." So already they're arguing. So I'm working beyond the words uh… is something that uh… is very important to me as a trainer and practitioner of sensorimotor psychotherapy, which is a body centered talking therapy uh… including the body without touch, without body work as part of our conversation in any kind of therapy. So in… in from a sensorimotor perspective, the difficulty in couple relationships comes because as soon as people get close, they become capable of triggering each others wounded places and often without any intention to… to hurt the other. And, you know, I say to my clients, I say "If you were traumatized in the context of a home, your closest relationships, your neighborhood, your community that's where you're gonna get trigger." So when you have clients who have had relational trauma and I actually yet to find a type of trauma that isn't relational, you know, war trauma, somebody shooting at me, car accident, somebody was driving a car, right. Think if… if anybody comes up with a type of trauma that doesn't involve other human beings, be sure to come up and tell me about it, because I've struggled with all types of trauma one way or another involve human beings. So some triggers abound for couples. There is very little that they can do discuss, that doesn't isn't like a landmine field. And so we have to teach them about triggering, uh… because triggering it's no fault… uh… it's a no fault system, so I helped them to notice that… that partner A is a hyper-arousal client, right. That this is what drives partner A. And then, I and I actually show them, well, it's my flip chart has gone. But I have an autonomic arousal diagram in my flip chart, I take it out, I show it to the clients and I say, "Which one are you." I ask them each to identify their nervous system style and I say "No wonder, you guys are having trouble," because just think as enormous percentage of the time one has hyper-arousal one has hypo. You know, a match made not in heaven, right. But when they look at the diagram, and you can just draw it on a piece of paper, they get it, oh, when she shuts down, I get angry and… and when… When I get angry, she shuts down, right. And now we're tracking the process. And not the process of words, the process without words. Now each client is gonna demonized the trigger, right, which is my term for the first time. Umm… the first time partner A shuts down and doesn't speak. When partner B says "I am really upset with you," right, that shutting down response that's now triggered Partner B is gonna get demonized it's gonna come, it's gonna become uh… partner A doesn't care about me. Partner A is cold and indifferent. Uh… Partner A is inhuman, you… you know, the language that couples use, right. They demonize the trigger. So they… you're looking at two reasonable people sitting in your office, each labeling the other as inhuman. Neither party knows that the relationship is not the issue. So I say to them, you know, you're two very reasonable people, your relationship is not the issue, there are no bad guys here. The… the bad guy in your relationship is the trauma and how it's still affecting you, right. So I create a new bad guy and we can demonize that, I don't mind demonizing the trauma, right. That becomes the bad guy and I say "You can either let the trauma destroy your relationship or you can band together and say no, we're not letting this determine how we live our lives as a couple." Uh… Sometimes an easier sell than others, right. Uh… Competing survival responses are a big part of the problem. She wants to talk about it, but that triggers his flight responses, because in his experience, a parent wanting to talk about it was about the most dangerous thing you could imagine. Umm… When he flees it triggers her fight response and she starts to pursue. And when she pursues, his fear I'm being chased, I'm being hunted down, gets triggered and he shuts down or withdraws, right. And she experiences the withdrawal as aggressive. And that triggers more anger. And then maybe she submits in order to maintain the connection, but blames him for having made her submit. Each feel is unsafe. So the other thing, besides, uh… you know, I see couples therapy as in part an education in relationship. And… and so my… I educate clients, relationships are not for sissies. Your common enemy is not each other, it's the trauma. And guess what, when you fight with each other, the trauma wins. Uh… Triggering oh, you guys are triggering each other to beat the band no wonder, it's so hard. And… and I redefine the relationship, I say "For you to have the closeness, you want," each of you has to feel safe with the other and each of you has to be committed to ensuring that the other feels safe too. So uh… we're gonna talk more in the workshop about non-verbal approaches to… to couples work, but one of the other things that uh… I may again be preaching to the converted, the other thing that's a very… very important part of therapy for traumatized couples is to cultivate play and fun. One of the things trauma does is it eliminates fun, play, and pleasure, right. You don't get to be playful when you're an abused child, you don't get to stop and play if you're running from the wolves. So I… if couples homework to surprise each other, when the key is I have to find homework that doesn't trigger either partner and… and, you know, because a lot of our homework assignments are really triggering. Uh… But the one thing I found that never ever triggers anybody is the homework assignment to surprise each other, to find fun surprises. Uh… Look as the couple's therapist at your (inaudible) to help them by providing an optimal level of safety and arousal in the room. Umm… You know, Sue Johnson talks about it as the couple's therapist titrating the risk for each partner, because if the therapy is too risky for one or the other, it's gonna breakdown. So we have to also pay attention to not only how they're triggering each other, but to how we are triggering each of them. Uh… Now that means using your voice, your body language, your energy uh… the degree of empathy versus challenge, you know, often the avoidant partner is challenge more than the… the fight/flight partner. I have to really… I find it works much better to empathize with the avoidant partner that that's much more likely to create communication. Uh… Notice the effects of education. You know, what I love about working with the flip chart, is I get both partners to focus on a neutral object, instead of focusing on each other. I remember I had a couple who came in a terrible argument and I said "Oh, I get it, you know, the problem is that she's an external regulator and you're an internal regulator, right. You're like the bear who goes into the forest to lick his wounds, you know, you like to do it inside. She likes to regulate through interaction. And then I said to him "What is it that you love most about your wife." And he said "What I… what I love about her even though she makes me crazy." Uh… What I love about her is how affectionate she is. How… how… how much she expresses love, how much she says nice things about me. And I said I gotta… "I've got bad news for you, "only an external regulator would be that affectionate and that a positive and verbal with you. And I said to her what is it that you love or admire her about your husband. And she said "he's strong, he's competent, he always knows what to do." And I said "Oh, gosh I got bad news for you too." Only an internal regulator would have that kind of ability to not have to stop and talk with somebody about what to do, but adjust to it, right. So remember to that expecting the best in individuals brings out the best in them. Oops, did I move around too much? I love this quote from (inaudible), because it expresses beautifully what the way I… the way I embody my practice. I don't accept people as they are. I treat them as though they are already capable. You know, I treat that shutdown avoidant partner as brilliant, right. How… What a brilliant way of defending against abuse and neglect to hunker down, and disconnect from feelings that would have been overwhelming. And… and… and my unspoken messages if you were smart enough to do that as a kid, you're not gonna have a problem learning how to connect. You might connect your way. You might not connect the way she wants you to connect, but if you could learn to save yourself by disconnecting its not gonna be a problem, right. And if I say to her, you learned that if you didn't cry help, nobody noticed and that was brilliant, because it was true. Nobody was gonna notice, unless you kept saying there's something wrong… there's something wrong. And… And now uh… it's not working quite so well with your husband, but it was brilliant. And so I'm really saying if you could learn to do that, you can learn to communicate to him in ways that instead of triggering him, invite him. Honor the defensive strategies, right. I… I truly honor them, because I think it's a miracle that young children develop these adaptive responses to trauma, even though it may harm them years later, right. Staying at a distance, smart, if you have abusive parents. Phobias of pleasure, of affection, of closeness, smart in a world where any positive effect or expression would get punished. You or you may not know this, but if abusive parents seem to be triggered even more by children being happy than by tears or anger. And so our clients often don't feel comfortable feeling safe and close or happy, because it was never safe. Remember that in attachment the… the attachment researchers say "Secure safe attachment is not about alleviating distress. It's about cultivating positive states," right. I tell my clients look, you can do what you're doing right now at home for free, since you're paying me the big bucks, let's do it differently, right. So I don't allow them to fight the same old fight. I say let's pause "Is this working." When you say blah-blah… blah is your husband getting it or is he getting triggered. With you shut down is she getting it or is it triggering her, right. So you wanna maximize positive effect, right. I think couples therapists are inherently good at that. We laugh, we keep, you know, we can create lightness in the midst of darkness, but know that each time you do that and you even help the couples laugh with you, you're actually helping to heal their attachment systems that's the beauty of him. Dan Hughes says the "Primary therapeutic attitude that needs to be demonstrated by the therapist throughout a session is one of playfulness except his curiosity and empathy," right. He told… He was talking, the day I wrote this down, he was talking about kids. And I thought wait a minute what about grownups, right. We can do use of playfulness, acceptance, curiosity, and empathy too can't we. So I'm gonna end with this quote from Martha Graham that… that to me is a very… very important and guides my work. She writes "I believe that we learn by practice whether it means to learn to dance by practicing dancing, to learn to live by practicing living, the principles are the same. Practice means to perform over and over again in the face of all obstacles some active vision a faith of desire. Practice is a means of inviting what is desired.
