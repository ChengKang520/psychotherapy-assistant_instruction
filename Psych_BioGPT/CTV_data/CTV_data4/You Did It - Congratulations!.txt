ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is You Did It! Congratulations! Fantastic! Your perseverance got you all the way through to Day 30. I'm completely impressed and delighted for you. Let's practice together. Well, today is really about doing anything at all that's new, normal, interesting, enjoyable, something that has a new twist and allows you to stretch and celebrate. And really, it's only just the beginning. That's all, that's the task. Also of course if you're ready for this, start from day one again and continue. Recognize, did you notice how 30 days of practice has changed you? Did you allow yourself to truly practice each and every day? Try it again so you can really deeply integrate each and every practice using it as a growth opportunity. Remember day 30 will always be your celebration day. Practice this again throughout the day whenever you need to recapture feelings of comfort or calm. Take the time right now to form a new healthy practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky, from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
