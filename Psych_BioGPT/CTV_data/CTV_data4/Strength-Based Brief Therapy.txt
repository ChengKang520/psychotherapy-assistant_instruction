Strength-Based Brief Therapy Bill O'Hanlon, MS 

00:00:35
BILL O'HANLON Okay. Thank you for being here in a timely manner. I like to start on time. We're starting a minute or two late, um, just so we have the full time to be together. Um, and I'm gonna say a few things then we're gonna do some stuff together. Um, I, I they asked what would you like to demonstrate on, and I have many things that I'm interested, in which I'm interested, in which I do. And I wanted to demonstrate strength-based therapy because that's what for me came out of the legacy of my work with Dr. Erikson, my time with Dr. Erikson, is I recognize people's resources and strengths and abilities. In fact the first case that I heard from was a woman who was suicidal and she had a gap in her front teeth, which she saw as disfiguring, and one of the first things that Dr. Erikson says to her is, "I want you between now and the next session to practice squirting water through that gap in your teeth 'til you squirt it with an accuracy of 10 to 12 feet." And this totally, you know I was in psychology undergraduate school at the time. I thought, "They're not teaching me this in psychology school." Whatever he's, whatever he's up to, and it took some years to articulate it, but I finally kinda realized he was interested in using even what seem like liabilities, as assets, as resources. And of course the famous story that I tell fair amount that to me illustrates this is the woman that he meets is also depressed and she's withdrawn from the world because she's had some physical problems, and she used to be really active in her church. He goes to visit her in Milwaukee because he knows her nephew, and he asks, uh, he asks Dr. Erikson to visit her because she's been really depressed and withdrawn and , Erikson sees her and she has a great interest in plants and he suggests that she takes an African Violet plant out to people in her community, and her church community and her local community. Bring an African Violet plant to them, uh, whenever there's a birth, a death, a graduation, an illness, a sad or happy event in someone's life, with her human and Christian presence. And 20 years later, or 15 years later, they can't fit the people in the memorial service after she dies because she touched so many people's lives. And I was thinking, you know I'm in graduate school and they're teaching me how to assess depression and they're not talking anything about this stuff. They're talking about fixing the depression and assessing the pathology, and where it came from and maybe treating with medications or cognitive therapy, and Erikson's talking about something entirely different. It took quite a bit of time to articulate it because he wasn't very explicit about it. But I came up with my own version of this and other people came up with their versions of it. But for me, I'm really interested in a couple of things. One is when people tell me the problem. I have this zen-like interest in when is the problem not happening. What's happening around the problem? And exceptions to the problem. So I once read a book on zen and art, and I'm not much of an artist, and the art, the zen guy was saying about art he said, "You know, regular people try, if they see a tree they try and draw the tree, but a zen you know, an artist person, they draw the space around and between the leaves and the branches, and the tree shows up." I thought, "Well that's why I'm not an artist 'cuz I'm trying to draw the tree and I'm not very good at it." But when I do psychotherapy and hypnotherapy, I'm really interested in the space around and between and not in the problem. The second way of thinking about this is, people come in and they tell you their story about the problem, and it's really something they're struggling with and suffering. And I think, "Well there's more to the story." I'm really interested in the rest of the story. I'm interested in what's more to the story. There's a human being there with all sorts of other possibilities and other things going on. There's a life there with a bigger story, and I'm interested in discovering that story. So for me, psychotherapy was leaning a lot towards pathology with the DSM and problem orientation and pathological orientation and trauma orientation. And I wanted to lean a little more on the other side and say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah that's what brings them in and you gotta attend to that." And I also wanna represent this other side of it, the what's working? Where are your resources? Where are your abilities?, Have you handled something like this before? So that's in the 25 words or less, or 80 words, or whatever I used or several sentences. That's the essence of what I, the kind of background for the conversation that I wanna have with you. And you have to remind me of your name, I'm terrible with names. 

00:05:30
MAGGIE Maggie. 

00:05:30
BILL O'HANLON Okay. And , so, I said somebody's struggling with something, some issue. What might that, what have you been dealing with and just give me a little background. I don't need to know everything about it, partly we don't have the time, but partly I just wanna know what you think is important for me to know about what you've been struggling with and also, given the fact that we're in front of a whole group and there's a video camera on, only say the things that you're comfortable with saying and having on tape. And you take care of yourself in whatever way. I, I can work with whatever you bring I guess is what I'm saying. 

00:06:10
MAGGIE I've been struggling for years now, with, um, I go to bed too late. Right? 10:30 comes around, um, I could go to sleep, but I don't. I start doing other things and I got to bed 12:00, 12:30, 1:00. Ttrying to get up at quarter 'til six to go to the gym doesn't work so I pay for lots of training sessions that I don't attend. 

00:06:30
BILL O' HANLON Yeah. 

00:06:35
MAGGIE Um, even here at the conference I was, um, missing all the early ones because here I don't make myself get up. I slept through. But, uh, so it's a problem in many ways, right? It, it's a problem for my um, sense of doing the right thing. It's a problem for, um . .. 

00:06:55
BILL O' HANLON So, what, just let me interrupt for a second. So you get a little self-critical. I'm, I keep messing up, why do you keep doing this? That kind of stuff? 

00:07:00
MAGGIE Oh, every day. 

00:07:00
BILL O' HANLON Okay. great all right 

00:07:00
MAGGIE Yeah. Um, it's a problem for my weight. I, I've been putting on weight because I don't sleep enough. Um, and I don't exercise enough because I . . . 

00:07:10
BILL O' HANLON Right. 

00:07:10
MAGGIE . . . didn't sleep enough. It's, uh, it's a problem for my sense of self mostly. All right. How come I'm an accomplished woman, I'm 62-years-old, I have children, grandchildren. Um, I've done well for myself. I have a good marriage. 

00:07:30
BILL O' HANLON You've done all these great things and it's like "ooh" in this area . . . 

00:07:35
MAGGIE And I can't do this one. 

00:07:35
BILL O' HANLON I just haven't been able to do, or I haven't yet consistently . . . 

00:07:40
MAGGIE No. 

00:07:40
BILL O' HANLON . . . done those things that I think, wow , if I could get this area together it would be consistent like some of the other stuff I've done. All right, good. 

00:07:45
MAGGIE Yep. 

00:07:50
BILL O' HANLON And so a couple of curiosities that I have. I again, you heard me talk about this, but I'm really interested in the moments or the times, or the phases even, if there have been these phases , when you have gotten to sleep or stopped doing things by 10:30 or a little earlier, a little earlier than 12:00 or 12:30 or whenever you've been typically doing it. Tell me about another night like that, a moment like that, a phase like that. Tell me about the kind of the exceptions, not the usual rules. 

00:08:25
MAGGIE Yeah. As you were talking, I was thinking when, when do I not do this staying up so late. And what came to mind is when I, I'm originally from Colombia in South America, but I've lived in the States 45 years. So when I go visit my family and we've had a full day of family, um, I'm satisfied, I think. 

00:08:50
BILL O' HANLON Ah. 

00:08:50
MAGGIE So that then I can go to bed when everybody else goes to bed instead of staying up and trying to fit more into the day. 

00:08:55
BILL O' HANLON Mm-hmm. So it's like there just hasn't been enough in the day. Either I haven't accomplished enough or I haven't experienced enough. I need a little more before I can let go of the day. But when your your day has been more rich and filled and, and almost always that's when you've been in visiting back home. Um, and any times that you can remember in here, in the states or even other places, if you've traveled, that you've been able to let go of the day a little more readily or gone to sleep a little more early or just not tried to fit so many things in at the end of the day? 

00:09:30
MAGGIE I think if I've had my grandchildren visit . . . 

00:09:30
BILL O' HANLON Uh-huh. 

00:09:35
MAGGIE . . .then, um, or if I've . . . 

00:09:35
BILL O' HANLON But, but, so don't go on too quickly from that. Wh-,..wh..why? I mean, what's different about that? Again, like visiting your family back in Colombia, that you're, it's more rich or, you're more exhausted from the grandki, I don't know. What, what? 

00:09:50
MAGGIE (laughing) Um . . . 

00:09:50
BILL O' HANLON How do you explain that, I guess? 

00:09:50
MAGGIE Well . . . 

00:09:50
BILL O' HANLON (inaudible ) 

00:09:55
MAGGIE There's a feeling coming up, um, I think because it, that feeds a part of me that doesn't get fed with just work, and, and . . . 

00:10:00
BILL O'HANLON Oh, so a lot of the days are work and duties and exercise, do the things you should do. 

00:10:05
MAGGIE Do the right thing. 

00:10:10
BILL O' HANLON And being with your family, maybe even when you go back to your original country, with your grandkids feeds what? What? Can you put a name on that? 

00:10:15
MAGGIE It, it's . . . me? 

00:10:20
BILL O' HANLON You. 

00:10:20
MAGGIE It feeds me. 

00:10:20
BILL O' HANLON You, your heart's absolved . . . 

00:10:20
MAGGIE As opposed to me giving . . . 

00:10:25
BILL O' HANLON Feeding other people. 

00:10:25
MAGGIE Others, yes. 

00:10:25
BILL O' HANLON Well, I mean, this is the woman thing often, isn't it? It's like, you know, I've had clients, female clients, who've said, I fall into bed exhausted and I haven't attended to one of my needs. I've been so focused on taking care of other people's needs, which is sorta how we're socialized, men and women a lot. And, and as therapists, (laughing) you know, we're taking care of everybody else. And so, a lot of times you're focused out and taking care of other people, but occasionally when your grandkids visit, when you go home . . . 

00:10:55
MAGGIE Mm-hmm. 

00:10:55
BILL O' HANLON . . . you're getting that nurturing, satisfaction, fulfillment, some of your personal heart, soul needs, interpersonal needs, are being met. Any other situations besides the grandkids that you can think of that does that, you know, not just work, duty, take care other people's stuff and you really feel like, wow, this day has been satisfying? 

00:11:20
MAGGIE I, I think anytime that I do something like, if I have, um, if I have a party at my house and I have company and I really enjoy myself, then I don't have to do anything else when it's done. I can go to bed. 

00:11:30
BILL O'HANLON That's nice. Yeah. That's really nice. So, so far the ones I've heard, but I'm curious . . . 

00:11:40
MAGGIE Mm-hmm. 

00:11:40
BILL O' HANLON . . . 'cuz I wanna find maybe another one or two, but maybe there won't be, um, are interpersonal ones. You get filled up with that wonderful interpersonal interaction. And the joying of relating, I guess. And exchange. Um, there would, I do some stuff with trauma and I just finished a book on trauma and there's a study that was done in, uh, Armenia, where they found that people who are with other people during earthquakes, develop PTSD at a much lower rate . . . 

00:12:10
MAGGIE Mm-hmm. 

00:12:10
BILL O' HANLON . . . than people who are alone. So there's something about that social connection that helps it feel like a satisfying day where you say, that's enough. I can let go and I can go to bed. Anything else you can think of that feeds you or nurtures you or satisfies you that , and maybe, you know, like I play music. And I used to say to people, "If I didn't play music, I think I would be insane." It, it feeds a diff- . . . 

00:12:35
MAGGIE Mm-hmm. 

00:12:35
BILL O' HANLON . . .you know, it speaks to a different part of my soul. My guitar, my piano, singing, playing it's totally non-work as you say. It's non-duty. I do it for the joy of it. And it does nurture me in a particular way. So, anything that you can think of besides people, other people? And that may be enough but . . . 

00:12:55
MAGGIE When, when I, I, I did a pilgrimage the way of Saint James, El Camino de Santiago it's called in Spain, and um . . . 

00:13:05
BILL O'HANLON Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I live in Sante Fe and Shirley Maclaine went on it so I know all about this. 

00:13:05
MAGGIE Okay, so you know about that. (laughing) 

00:13:10
BILL O' HANLON Tell us all about going on that trail. Sorry. 

00:13:10
MAGGIE It's a little different experience than hers , but . . . (laughing) 

00:13:15
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, I'm sure it was. I'm sure it was. You didn't have extraterrestrials and past lives visiting you. 

00:13:20
MAGGIE No, no I did not. (laughing) I did not. But I had a, um, I am not an athlete so this was a challenge physically, um, for me. And that was the idea, right? Um, it was my 60th birthday gift to myself, to do this. Each day, um, as time went on the, the challenge was not less. It was more even, because you're tired . . . 

00:13:45
BILL O' HANLON Because the road got harder? Or because you were tired? Or both? 

00:13:45
MAGGIE . . .and the road . . . yeah, you're tired , the road get's harder. You know, you know more. But each evening, um, I had accomplished something very concrete, right? So many miles. And I had done it on my two legs, right? (laughing) 

00:14:05
BILL O' HANLON (laughing) 

00:14:05
MAGGIE Um, and it was me and the, and the trail. Um, and it was me and this, this spiritual connection that began to happen, that wasn't about God so much. Of course, it was about God, but it was more about, about connecting to myself. And I think that that's what happens when I'm with my grandchildren, when I'm with my kids, when I'm with friends, my family is that I can be me. 

00:14:25
BILL O'HANLON You can be you and you connect to yourself? 

00:14:30
MAGGIE Yep. 

00:14:30
BILL O'HANLON Great. So, this is just a nice pause place for me. Given this discussion, here's the question I have for you. If you had a client sitting here and you are the therapist and you heard this from them, or you had a friend that you were advising, and based on what you know, based on what you just told me, what would you advise them then about finding that nurturing and connecting with themselves and being able to let go of the day based on the data that you have so far and the knowledge that you have so far? What would you say to that person? What advice would you give 'em? 

00:15:10
MAGGIE To find ways of creating, um, a space for themselves. For, for their own needs during the day. Which, of course, I don't do. 

00:15:20
BILL O'HANLON And if they said, if they said I have so much other stuff to do and I have so many other duties. I don't do that everyday or I'm gonna find it hard to do. What would you say to them if they . . . 

00:15:30
MAGGIE I would say well volunteer, it builds presentation and have it help you . . . (laughing) 

00:15:35
BILL O'HANLON (laughing) You're so wise. Um, and a wise acre, too. (laughing) And so, you know, and so if I just said that back to you and say, "Okay, you know it's not like this is a mystery that we've, you know, like, where does this deep, you know, underlying pattern of not going to sleep come from. I don't actually have that much interest, maybe you do. But I don't have that much, I have a really interest in what would help you shift this. So, if I said to you it's gonna be really, really important for your weight, for your health, for your mental health, for you not being so self-critical or down on yourself, for getting to those exercise appointments more consistently, that you build in, you make an appointment with yourself to do one of those nurturing things. Especially develop as a habit. Maybe I'd say, for the next month, it's like you know when they say exercise six days a week, but not seven. You can take one day off, but six days a week you deliberately schedule in, or build in, time with your grandkids, dinner party, um, whatever nurtures you. One small or larger thing, 'cuz some of them are gonna take a little longer. Every day for the next month, and then you can figure out what to do after that. Maybe you've developed it as a habit. Maybe you've connected to yourself enough so that the habit of staying up will be broken. If I said that to you, number one, would you do it? Number, and if not, what would might be the barriers? Or maybe just do it. And number two, do you think it would work? And number three, do you think it would last? Those are three questions. I guess, I should ask them one at a time, but you can answer whatever one you want. I don't remember all three. 

00:17:15
MAGGIE Would I do it depends on how much I believe that it would help. 

00:17:20
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, well how much do you believe . . . 

00:17:25
MAGGIE Right? Um . . . 

00:17:25
BILL O'HANLON . . . it would help? 

00:17:30
MAGGIE I think there's this, this Maggie that is so, um, driven by duty . . . 

00:17:35
BILL O'HANLON Yes. 

00:17:35
MAGGIE . . .that to take, to, to do those things takes time, right? Dinner party? Well, I can't do a dinner party. But maybe I can wh-, wh-, it's not practical to have dinner parties during the week. 

00:17:50
BILL O' HANLON Right. 

00:17:50
MAGGIE But maybe it's practical to have a phone call with my sisters, my, my, my parents, my . . . right? 

00:17:55
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, that's the kind of stuff. I'm saying you gotta find something really fairly short. . . 

00:18:00
MAGGIE Mm-hmm. 

00:18:00
BILL O' HANLON . . .and that aren't so labor intensive or time intensive, 'cuz you do have other things that you feel you need to do or you feel obligated to do or you want to do. So, small ones like that. So that's, so you just came up with one. 

00:18:10
MAGGIE Okay. So i can do that. I can do a, a daily phone call to, I've, I have, there's six of us kids, right? I can find somebody, I'm sure. And my parents are living so I can talk to them. And . . . 

00:18:25
BILL O'HANLON And then sometimes longer times with your grandkids. 

00:18:25
MAGGIE Yep. 

00:18:25
BILL O'HANLON Sometimes a dinner party, if it's a weekend or you know. 

00:18:30
MAGGIE Yeah. 

00:18:30
BILL O' HANLON Maybe, maybe you could schedule one a week or one every other week, for the next month. Just to sorta break this old habit and pattern of staying up late and to do some of that self-nurturing. And as long as you can find small things that wouldn't be so overwhelming . . . 

00:18:45
MAGGIE True. 

00:18:45
BILL O' HANLON . . . or another duty or whatever it may be. All right, so calling them on the phone. 

00:18:50
MAGGIE Mmhmm. I can do that. 

00:18:50
BILL O'HANLON All right. And any other things you can think of that might be short or medium or bigger, that aren't dinner parties or spending time with your grandkids or walking the Camino Trail. 

00:19:00
MAGGIE (laughing) 

00:19:00
BILL O' HANLON This might take a little longer. 

00:19:05
MAGGIE Yeah, um . . . Yeah, I, I can, I can walk with a friend in the morning. I can do that. I can create a challenge for myself at the gym. 

00:19:20
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. Would that, but I'm challenging this a little. Would that be nurturing for you, or not? Or would that be another duty? (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
MAGGIE (crosstalk)It would be stimulating for me. It would be stimulating, for me. 

00:19:30
BILL O'HANLON Stimulating? But enough to let you let go at night. I'm not sure. 

00:19:35
MAGGIE I don't know. 

00:19:35
BILL O'HANLON I don't either. You might have to experiment with that one. But I don't, I wanna make sure it doesn't, that those aren't more the Maggie duty things. Because you have enough of those already. 

00:19:45
MAGGIE Yeah. 

00:19:45
BILL O' HANLON And you're good at that. As you say, you've succeeded and you've worked hard, and you've done these things and you, you know, that's great stuff. And I don't wanna take that away. That's great. It's one of the things that's moved you forward in life. And I'm trying to find this little pieces that you're saying, these really help me feel like, wow, this day has been satisfying. I've had, I've nurtured me rather than done all that I have to do . . . 

00:20:05
MAGGIE Mm-hmm. 

00:20:05
BILL O' HANLON . . . and nurtured everybody else. So, that may be enough. The phone calls, the time with your grandkids. The, uh, the dinner parties on occasion, and, calls. Okay? 

00:20:20
MAGGIE I can do that. 

00:20:20
BILL O'HANLON All right so that's possibility. Okay, so that's one thing. So, I wanna ask another, it's sort of a different . . . 

00:20:30
MAGGIE Mm-hmm. 

00:20:30
BILL O' HANLON . . .direction I'm curious about. And that is, have you ever had another habit that didn't serve you well like staying up too late at night, but in a totally different realm, like smoking or something else that you made a change in? 

00:20:50
MAGGIE (laughing) I, I stopped smoking 37 yearsago, but I did it with hypnosis. 

00:20:55
BILL O'HANLON Yes. She did it with hypnosis. They, they all go, wha-, what. You did it with hypnosis? 

00:21:00
MAGGIE Yeah. 

00:21:00
BILL O'HANLON And what did the hypnosis do? How do you think the hypnosis worked? What, what about the hypnosis, because some people, get hypnotized they don't stop smoking. Some people do. 

00:21:10
MAGGIE Mm-hmm. 

00:21:10
BILL O' HANLON What do you think moved you in terms of that? 

00:21:15
MAGGIE I think, I think I wanted to stop. And I think I believed that I needed a little extra help. 

00:21:20
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:21:20
MAGGIE Because I had done it, I had stopped before on my own, but it, it you know, a year or two years, but I kept going back. But, but I think I believed that that, uh . . . 

00:21:30
BILL O' HANLON That gave you that extra little . . . 

00:21:30
MAGGIE . . . that would do it . That that would lock it. 

00:21:35
BILL O'HANLON You were on your way to it but, eh, it wasn't clear it was gonna succeed. 

00:21:35
MAGGIE Mm-hmm. 

00:21:35
BILL O' HANLON But you sought that extra little help. So two things about that. One is, you know some people don't seek help they just try and power through it. But what was it that gave you the idea, I need a little booster here, I need a little help, something extra? 

00:21:50
MAGGIE Then or now? 

00:21:55
BILL O'HANLON Then. 

00:21:55
MAGGIE Then it was, um, I really wanted to stop and I had, I had, uh, I mean I knew I could do it I just didn't know that I could do it forever. That i could really stay a non-smoker. I didn't know that. 

00:22:10
BILL O'HANLON So you're pretty committed. 

00:22:10
MAGGIE Mm-hmm. 

00:22:10
BILL O' HANLON If I'm gonna do this I really want it to last. 

00:22:10
MAGGIE Yeah. 

00:22:10
BILL O' HANLON And I'm gonna get as much extra help . . . 

00:22:15
MAGGIE Mm-hmm. 

00:22:15
BILL O' HANLON . . . and stack the deck into succeeding as best I can. And hypnosis seemed a good way to do that. Okay, good, good. That's pretty good. All right, so you wanted a little hypnosis with this, too? 

00:22:25
MAGGIE I would love to. 

00:22:25
BILL O'HANLON All right, good. So, now just get yourself in whatever comfortable position you do. And, um, just warning the audio people my voice drops a bit so you may have to do some adjustment, dynamic adjustments of that. Um, and so I'll say to you the first thing is just to let yourself be exactly where you are. To just tune in to where you are. Because my kind of, you've probably seen some of this around here, you know this tradition. I was trained with Erikson and had a different approach than the traditional stuff that maybe you experienced back then or maybe you had this kind. That there's no right way or wrong way to do this. It's really permissive and gentle and that you can keep your eyes open to go into trance. Or they may close. And you may prefer to have them close, it's up to you and something inside you. As you may have an idea about it but something inside you may have a different idea. And you only need to go as deeply as you need to go to do two things really: One is to access some sort of experiential memory of what it was like to make that shift hypnotically all those years ago. You don't have to remember that consciously. Your body can remember. That's right. The non-rational aspects if you can remember. So you can remember it physiologically, neurologically and even the affect. So that you really wanted to make this shift. And you are hedging your bets to get a little more support to do what you already wanted to do. What you've already knew you could do at some level. And you made that change, it's been a long-term change. And it'd be nice if I were talking to you, maybe not 37 years from now, but a year from now, and you were telling me when I saw you in another context, maybe at another conference, how most of the last year you'd been going to bed in a timely manner and you'd been really nurturing yourself, caring for yourself in this way. And what other effects happened from that shift. So you only need to go deeply enough to access whatever resources need to be accessed to do that. It might be the resource of letting go. It might be a resource of holding on to yourself and connecting to yourself. It might be a resource of finding some sort of sense of satisfaction within. It might be another resource altogether that I haven't even put a name on that you don't need to put a name on maybe or maybe you'd like to. That'll help you get to sleep in a timely manner. To get a really good night sleep that nurtures your health, your well-being, your sense of peace, satisfaction, your goals. That you can trust yourself that you know all that you need to know. That you have the resources within and around that you can draw upon in whatever way is right in the moment. And you can go deeper if you need to, want to. Some people, while they're in trance, notice other changes --changes in the body, changes in the perception, changes in the mind. Changes in the breathing, the swallowing, changes in the legs, changes in the arms. Sometimes when I go into trance I lose track of my hands. I know, I know intellectually where they are, but experientially they start to disappear, go numb. And that's usually one of my signs. I don't know what it is for you. All I know is that you can find a way to connect yourself and find within yourself the experience of enough. One time I met a woman who'd studied with Dr. Erikson. I was teaching and she came up to me and told me the story that she went to see him during one of those teaching seminars that he did near the last years of his life. And she was very pleased that during the week he invited her stay after the class, after the group because she'd expressed an interest in plants. And he brought her out to his garden. He gave her a garden shears and he directed her to go to one plant and take some cuttings off that plant that she could take home and grow, sprout, make her own plants. She was very honored that he would be giving her something from his own garden. After she took two or three cuttings he said, "That's good enough." And then he directed her to another plant. She took two or three cuttings and he said, "Okay. That's good enough." Then he directed her to another plant. All in all she had about 12 or 15 of these cuttings. And many years later, she was going through a really difficult time in her life. And as usual she was kinda down on herself for her failings, for not doing it right. And all of sudden that voice came back to her. She heard Dr. Erikson's voice saying, "That's good enough." And she realized he wasn't just talking about the plants. That he had recognized her self-criticalness and he was giving her that gentle permission to know that she was good enough. And she was able to let something go at that time. That self-criticalness diminished and she was able to say, "I've done it well enough. I've been good enough." And I think that would be nice. For you to have the sense of that's good enough. I heard a story the other day on the internet. I watched a video. There was this man telling a story about our national excess of debt and everybody wanting everything and charging their credit cards. He said it reminds me of a story of Kurt Vonnegut, the author. One time attended a party in the Hamptons with Joseph Heller, the other author. And the party was held in the home of a hedge-fund trader who made millions of dollars every month. Fabulously wealthy guy. They were standing in his living room which was bigger than both of their houses combined. And Kurt Vonnegut was teasing and chiding Heller. He said, "Joe, doesn't it make you jealous that this guy probably earns more in a day than you earned from your best-selling book, Catch 22?" Joseph Heller said, "No, I'm not jealous at all." And Vonnegut said, "C'mon tell the truth." And he said, "No. I'm not jealous because I have something this fella doesn't have." "What could you possibly have this fella doesn't have? He has everything." He said, "He doesn't know the meaning of enough." And it's nice to know the meaning of enough. That you've accomplished enough. That you're good enough. That it's enough. That there's been enough. And that you can rest in who you are, what you've done, what you've experienced, where you are right now. 

00:33:05
[sil.] 

00:33:10
BILL O'HANLON So now I just invite you to take a moment or two, maybe a minute or so of clock time. As much inner time as you want to do what you need to do to finish up inside. Knowing that according to me that what you've done has been enough. And then when you're ready to reorient to the present time, present place, to come all the way back in a way that's right for you, that's comfortable for you and stay connected to yourself in a way that's right for you. 

00:34:00
[sil.] 

00:34:05
BILL O'HANLON And when you're ready to come all the way back just open your eyes and reorient all the way. 

00:34:15
[sil.] 

00:34:45
BILL O'HANLON That's right. 

00:34:50
[sil.] 

00:34:55
BILL O'HANLON Okay. Ground control to Maggie. So, uh, can you say a little about that? Or you wanna just sit with it? What would you prefer? 

00:35:05
MAGGIE I think I wanna sit with it. 

00:35:05
BILL O'HANLON Okay, great. All right, so that's all I have. Um, can you, are you willing to stay up here and, we've got a few minutes, um, that we could entertain questions from the peanut gallery or comments from the peanut gallery. And they may have some questions for you or comments for you and they may have questions for me. Uh, so we have a microphone, least, uh on that, that I got, yeah, over there as well so if you have a question or comment on what you saw, um, you're welcome to come up to the microphone and either Maggie or I or both of us will endeavor to speak to or respond to that question or comment and it can be either one question or comment. And you can come out of trance, as well. Now. 

00:35:55
MAGGIE (laughing) 

00:36:00
BILL O' HANLON Just go to the mic and if there's a line just take turns. 

00:36:05
UNKNOWN I have a question (inaudible ) 

00:36:10
BILL O'HANLON He's coming to turn it on right now. I took 'em by surprise. 

00:36:15
MAGGIE Thank you. 

00:36:15
BILL O'HANLON Thank you. It was great. Thanks for being so open and so willing, too, nice. There we go. Sorry 'bout that, thanks. 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN Okay. Now I don't, I, I guess my hesitancy in asking the question is because I don't want to, um, saying it's a negative suggestion. So , so, but I had a que-, because when, when you were talking about making phone calls to your various relatives and and that being nurturing for you, my, I was wondering if you, somehow you weren't doing that now, I, I, I guess (inaudible ). 

00:37:05
BILL O'HANLON So that went off there. The last thing was that would be something new you would be doing. Have you do that a bit now but not as . . 

00:37:10
MAGGIE Yeah. I don't do it daily. I do it usually on weekends. Um, because that's when I have time. Um, but I can, I can do it during the, the week, as well. 

00:37:25
BILL O'HANLON So that would be a bit new to have it more often. Maybe a shorter call but during the week because if it's gonna be important for this goal, for this shift, she's willing to take that time and invest that in because it might help her get to sleep a little quicker. Get up a little better, that kind of stuff. So it's new and not new I guess is what, is what we say. The, the newness would be doing it more consistently and maybe during the week. 

00:37:50
MAGGIE And also the intention. Because now I call if I have something to say, not because I want to connect necessarily, but because I have something that I need to know. Or in response to something they, they want. 

00:38:05
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. Good. All right, thanks. 

00:38:10
UNKNOWN Thank you both so much for what you did. That was really, really worth our learning from. And thank you for your courage in going. My question, and I may have misunderstood, um, the learning at the beginning about your history. Did you say you were marriage, married? 

00:38:30
MAGGIE I am. 

00:38:30
UNKNOWN Then Dr. O'Hanlon, I have a question. I was interested that you did not go toward any part of the relatedness with her husband. 

00:38:45
BILL O'HANLON You know that's good. I mean, you know, I could've and if you were up here speaking in my ear I might've asked about that. Um, uh, truly and I'm not being sarcastic. I, you know, It's just what occurs in the moment. I'm very, very, I mean, I have curiosities and I'm very much go with what she speaks about. And again, this is this maybe radical idea. Maybe not so radical for some of you, but it's especially in this Eriksonian tradition. I'm really interested in what she's interested in and what she has to say. And I don't have so much of an agenda. I have a vague agenda, like I wanna be able to be helpful and find out what the resources and possibilities are for her. But I don't have any of these, like, oh the marriage, and I should check that out. I don't have any of that stuff. I just have this curiosity of what's the bigger story. What's an exception? What is the resource? What's an ability? What does she know about this? Much more than what I know about it. I may have all sorts of theories and ideas like everybody else going through my head, but when I'm up here I try not to think as much as possible. Just to attend and be curious and let the conversation flow where it will. So another conversation might of gone into the relationship. And it just didn't this time and I was totally fine with that because I don't think there's any right or true conversation. It's just a conversation we're gonna have right now that's either helpful or not. So, that's my response to that. Wait, wait. We should let Maggie respond to that 'cuz she may have a perspective on it as well or not. You have anything? 

00:40:25
MAGGIE I think that my husband is as dutiful as I am. (laughing) So he, he's . . . 

00:40:30
BILL O' HANLON Is he . . 

00:40:30
MAGGIE . . . loving and there and makes coffee and, for me, if I need it, and takes me to the car in the morning with all my bags and things that I have for the whole day. So he's present, he's very present, but but that's I guess not the type of connection that I, that keeps me up. 

00:40:50
BILL O' HANLON Yeah. 

00:40:55
UNKNOWN While you were in the trance state, do you know how you, uh, accessed the Erikson story? How did you do that? How did it come to mind? 

00:41:00
BILL O'HANLON By association, I guess. That's how I remember most of my stories. Um, and how, and I don't know, I mean the first answer's I don't know because I go into a place of not thinking. I was, you know, done (inaudible ) here at this conference and we were once on a panel together and we would show our work. Each of us--there were four of us--we'd show our work and then we'd talk about it for 15 minutes and then we'd have comments from the other panelists and then had questions and comments from the audience. And I showed mine and someone came up after the discussion and said, you know, from the audience, and said, "What are you thinking during that." I said, "I don't think during that." And then, you know, i just am with the person absolutely not thinking and Don leaned forward to the microphone he said, "Having watched that tape, I recommend you start thinking, Bill." 

00:41:40
MAGGIE (laughing) 

00:41:40
MAGGIE Um, so Don always there with the support. But I am truly not thinking and I am just, I have a sense that she's telling me what to say. That sounds quite mystical. But I have a sense I'm supposed to get out of the way. I had some, I went to Arizona State University and I had some friends that had a little folk-rock group and they had a line from one of the songs, Woodlark Haven, they had a line from one of the songs and it was, "We are all flutes through which the breath of God shall past." And I still remember that line because my task I think up here, is to make my flute as clean and clear as possible by doing training before, thinking about this, practicing all the skills that I have and then getting out of the way and letting the breath come through me. I have a sense I didn't say one of these words and I said every one of these words. That is, they were spoken through me. And I have a sense she was telling me, this is what I need to hear right now, by her responses and by what she told me before. I try to give it back as, as healing poetry, if you will. So I don't know, is my answer. And I think by association. She was saying, It's not enough. I can't go to sleep because it hasn't been enough yet. And so that story just came to me in whatever way stories come to people. 

00:42:55
UNKNOWN Just interested in that cue. But you were able to find, uh, uh, almost without thinking about it, but (crosstalk)(inaudible ) 

00:43:04
BILL O'HANLON (crosstalk) Not almost. Without thinking about it, yeah. Without consciously, deliberately thinking about it. I'm sure something is thinking in me, through me. Don! (laughing) Yeah, go ahead. 

00:43:15
UNKNOWN Got an indirect story that speaks to your point. My, uh, two daughters are here and the eldest is almost seven. She just, uh, was in downtown Disney and did this beautiful drawing, beyond what I thought was her capacity. Uh, she was just looking around seeing the other, uh, artists sort of doing things. And I said to her, I said, "Where did you, where did you get the idea to this?" She said, "I don't know. It just started coming from me." And I said, "But, but where?" And she said, "I guess my brain." (laughing) 

00:43:45
BILL O'HANLON (laughing) That's it. That's the ticket. She and I, I'm about at that seven-year-old level. Yeah, definitely. 

00:43:50
MAGGIE By the way, the, I, I wanna say that the the story, both stories, um, went very deeply in and and, um, this, this knowing that was not cognitive at all about, um, I am enough. I am enough. Not just the day was enough, but being enough. 

00:44:15
BILL O'HANLON That's nice. That's great. Good to hear. Thank you. 

00:44:20
UNKNOWN Bill, if I could ask you a question. 

00:44:25
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN What guided your decision to move into trance work, uh, and . . . 

00:44:30
BILL O'HANLON She said she found it helpful before. 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN And how frequently do you do that in sessions, or stay a little bit more conscious, uh, conscious work? 

00:44:40
BILL O'HANLON A third and two-thirds. I think a third trance. 'Bout two-thirds, I, it's ju-, it's, but it's individually variable. But I mean, she just told me. I didn't think it was like, you know, brilliant strategy. I, I just, she, I did hypnosis before when I changed a habit. It was really hard habit to change it and it really helped. I say okay, well, you know, what am I? I'm just, uh, let's do if it works, why do something different? Just do something the same. If it doesn't work, do something different. 

00:45:15
UNKNOWN That was similar to my question. Had she not mentioned that she had done hypnosis and it had been successful before, how might you have done the session differently? 

00:45:20
BILL O'HANLON I probably wouldn't have done hypnosis, wouldn't have occurred to me. 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN Right, but how would you have dealt, how would you have brought out her resources and strengths in a way that would be suggestive or that would bring them to her? 

00:45:35
BILL O'HANLON I might've asked her once she was through this and she was sleeping well and, you know, exercising the way she wanted to and getting up in the way and having a good night's sleep, what life would be like then? That's the sort of a future orientation. That's one thing I often do. I might have asked her a little differently, if you had a client that came in with this struggle, what would you say to them? That was a little different than the question I asked her. There a multiple ways to get to resources and solutions. And what, and strengths--and what happens for me is as we're talking, she'll mention something. And I'll go with that thread because all a sudden I hear . . . I go like a heat-seeking missile for possibilities, strengths, and solutions and exceptions to problems. And so, they often emerge during the conversation so I couldn't say where I woulda gone. I might've asked a few questions to open some lines of inquiry. But more than that, just in the conversation she tells me pretty much everything I need to know. And so I would've followed that, whatever that was. And she was telling me some great stuff. I learned a great deal in a fairly, really relatively short amount of time, about what worked and what didn't. Much more I could've learned if we had a longer conversation, but this seems enough. 

00:46:50
MAGGIE (laughing) 

00:46:55
UNKNOWN Do you have to believe in hypnosis for it to work for you? 

00:46:55
BILL O'HANLON I don't believe in hypnosis. 

00:47:00
MAGGIE (laughing) 

00:47:00
BILL O' HANLON I don't. I don't think there's such a thing as hypnosis. We were just on a panel and it's, you know, Jeff was saying, "It's this interagonal (ph) thing," and Steve Gilligan (ph) says, "It's this interactional thing." It's just a conversation we're having which is a slightly different format. And we have these words for it called trance and hypnosis. But it's a, it's a special kind of conversation I guess, which, in which I'm mainly dominating a conversation with my words. But I have a sense that your body is speaking to me in a wei-, that's a weird way to say it, and speaking to my body your heart is speaking to my heart, your soul and spirit are speaking to my spirit and telling me what to say. And so even though I'm mainly doing a lot of verbalizations and I'm not asking you a lot . . . 

00:47:45
MAGGIE Mm-hmm. 

00:47:45
BILL O' HANLON . . .I think you're speaking volumes to me. So I just have a sense of it's a slightly different conversation. And we call it trance for a good shorthand. And it's an altered state, but so is this conversation, and so is this conversation. I'm in an altered state definitely. Because most of the time I have that yada yada going on in my head, and I'm just here not thinking again. Um, thank you. 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN So I'm wondering where you got the self-critical story? Um, did she tell you she was self-critical or did you surmmize that? Wha, how did sh, did she tell you that in the beginning? 

00:48:20
BILL O'HANLON I believe you told me that. 

00:48:20
MAGGIE I did. 

00:48:20
BILL O' HANLON Yeah. 

00:48:20
UNKNOWN At the beginning? 

00:48:20
BILL O' HANLON Unless I hallucinated it. I seem to remember . . . 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:48:25
BILL O' HANLON . . . That she said, yeah, you know I haven't done it, you know, I get down on myself 'cuz I'm not exercising. I get down on myself because I'm not sleeping enough. 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN Okay, yeah. 

00:48:30
BILL O' HANLON Yeah. I think she said it pretty explicitly. It wasn't like major interpretation I had. All right, so, you know, we gotta couple of minutes. So can you tell us about this experience a little more now that you've had a little time to sit with it? You said a little but if there's anymore that would be helpful. 

00:48:55
MAGGIE Um, (laughing) 

00:49:00
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. Very articulate. 

00:49:05
MAGGIE I am. I'm a Gemini. I, I'm supposed to be. 

00:49:10
BILL O'HANLON I can ask a few questions or you can just . . . 

00:49:10
MAGGIE Well . . . 

00:49:10
BILL O' HANLON . . . wait for those words to come out. 

00:49:15
MAGGIE What I'm going to remember in my body, is this idea that, um, that I'm worth, I'm worth resting. I'm worth going to bed early. That, that I, that, um, I've done enough, right? And up until now I'd been doing more than enough. I don't need to go that far, right? 

00:49:40
BILL O'HANLON Right. You don't need to earn that enough. (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
MAGGIE I don't need to earn that, no. Um, that, that's, that is what's resonating now. Right? Since, since the experience and through the conversation is that sense of, um, um, I am truly (laughing) enough. You know. 

00:50:05
BILL O'HANLON I'm convinced of that, then yeah. Hoo hoo. yeah. Um, good. And so, out of curiosity, you know, it's hard to tell I think, sitting here, but maybe you have a sense of it. You know, on a scale of 1 to 100, how confident are you that that sense can stick with you, and that it, these are two questions, One is that it stick with you. And I guess the second one, on a scale of 1 to 100, you know 100 being I'm totally confident and 1 being, ahhh, I don't think it'll happen at all. Somewhere in between there maybe. Um, how likely do you think this is gonna make a difference in the time that you go to sleep? So those two, two curiosities. One is how much that sense will stick with you. The other one is how much it'll make a difference in that specific thing we've talked about. 

00:50:55
MAGGIE When I quit smoking and I left her office, um, I didn't think that it, that it was going to work. 

00:51:05
BILL O' HANLON And it made the big difference 

00:51:05
MAGGIE You know, I didn't feel different, differently. She asked me to change something about myself and I moved my watch from my left to my right. And that, that was my change, which remains. (laughing) Right. Um, so it took time to believe. Right? And um, I don't know, three days later I went to a party and people were smoking and I was like, hmm. So, I'll let you know tomorrow. 

00:51:35
BILL O'HANLON Time, time will tell. Yeah. 

00:51:35
MAGGIE Time will tell. Um, if I, if you must have a number, I'm gonna give it high 70s for the confidence that it will stay. And, um, 80s that I will go to bed at a reasonable time. 

00:51:50
BILL O'HANLON Right. Yeah, and time will tell as you, I don't know, you don't know. And, you know, think back to the Maggie sitting there before we started this. Anything else you can give me or you or us a sense of, you were sitting down there one kind of way and one kind of feeling and one kind of sense of things about this issue and then when you came up here now as you walk down and, you know, take your chair or go out into another session or go out, w-, could you say , in 25 words or less, what do you think shifted? It may be what you've just said. May be something else. I'm not sure. 

00:52:30
MAGGIE I feel different in my body. 

00:52:35
BILL O' HANLON Okay. 

00:52:35
MAGGIE I, I feel, um, more centered. It's not a new feeling that I've never had but it's a nice feeling to remember, to, to have again, to experience again of confidence, right? Of, um, good as I am. 

00:52:50
BILL O'HANLON That's great. Now, you know, I guess I would echo what a few other people said and just my reading of the tenor in the room, that I was really absolutely impressed with your clarity, your will , your vulnerability, willingness to come up here and be so authentic and you, the Maggie, you know Maggie showed up here definitely. It wasn't some sort of performance of Maggie. It was Maggie. And I really got a sense of you and, you know, you contributed to the, to my life and to these people's learning. So I just want to express my gratitude and thank you for that. 

00:53:25
MAGGIE Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. 

00:53:30
BILL O'HANLON Thank you so much. All right. 

00:53:30
