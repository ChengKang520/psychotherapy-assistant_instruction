CLIVE JONES Okay, now we're going to look at the interpersonal one. Ah, a lot of theorists have, that moved from Freud's ideas are still considered in, in a psychodynamic perspective, they consider that the ego was the more important part of the intrapersonal area of, of concern. They thought that it was the ego, that was in the conscious part of the person, is the part of major concern. And not only the ego, but how the ego interacted with others. Cuz how that individual, and that part of us that we're very aware of, and that part of us that's in our conscious mind and thought, um, how that part of us interacts with others. And so, we're, we're going to have a look at a couple of ideas in, in how, uh, anxiety can develop in the context of our relationship with others. Uh, I'll just move on to one person and that's, uh, Alfred Adler. And he moved away from Freud's, some of Freud's ideas and, and started to focus on, on the interpersonal. And so, he sort of links the intrapersonal with the interpersonal and, again, it, it's very significant. He suggests that, um, that often young children, uh, being vulnerable in a world and being so dependent on others, could potentially develop a feeling of inferiority. And, and it was Alfred Adler that coined the term "inferiority complex." And, and in that, whereby we, we start off feeling insecure, and that's at an intrapersonal level. But then it's how we interact with the world around us that will determine whether or not we can build a sense of, what he called, not so much, uh, superiority in the sense of lording it over somebody, but whereby we feel a sense of achievement and personal growth and satisfaction. The opposite of that is, is feeling, uh, inferior and vulnerable and unsafe and scared and frightened in a hostile world. Okay? So, that sense of inferiority while moving to a sense of self-fulfillment, achievement. Some things that, uh, he, he would suggest that would have a person move from feeling so vulnerable and inferior, being a little baby having to depend on, on, on everybody else, and then growing into somebody that was a lot more interdependent and being able to function and, and deal with matters themselves. He would suggest that it's social involvement that's important. Healthy social connections, uhh, whether it's interaction and mutual assistance and helping and sharing with each other. Uh, he also suggested to build on strengths, which is very important. Uh, some children can feel very inferior in the context of schooling where everything is competitive and rated. And, and often, uh, it's important to encourage teachers to help children find their strengths, and where they find a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment in their strengths. Uh, otherwise, it could be that if a person isn't feeling capable in anything, that could be potentially a place of anxiety where they are feeling inferiority, where they're feeling helpless and hopeless in situations where they feel that they're unable to deal with things without having to depend on others, uh, and that can certainly snowball into a whole range of things that can have somebody in dependent, anxiety-causing relationships and, and, and network into a whole range of, of horrible things for the person. So, uh, but the feelings of infer-, of inferiority can develop through a child not finding their strengths, through not finding, you know, the things that they can achieve and grow and flourishing. And it's also if a child, uh, Adler would suggest, if, if overprotected and, and not allowed to, you know, to grow and experience the world, but where they're always encouraged to feel that they can't make decisions for themselves, that they're unable to, uh, take responsibility for themselves. And so, how a child is nurtured. And so, that's the first interpersonal aspect. A lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, post-Freudian or neo-Freudian theorists looked at the, the relationship that children had and saw that as a very important place where we started to lay the foundations of that, the way we felt in the future as adults. And again, we're looking at the developmental trajectory. We're looking at how things developed across a lifespan, and where it ends us up as adults. And so, in that sense, we do have to look at childhood and see where that may lead us. Not saying that we are trapped in the consequences of what happened in childhood, but we're going to get to see the part that it played in, uh, in encouraging us to feel, think, and behave in a certain way when we're adults. And so, Adler, uh, would encourage the, the process of relationships to encourage within the individual a sense of personal fulfillment and achievement and value, uh, and connection, uh, in a, in a social way.

Video Lecture 2: Part A: Interpersonal Considerations in Personality and Anxiety Attachment Theory 

00:05:25
CLIVE JONES Therapists and theorists continue to look at, you know, various causes of our emotional state, uh, at different times. And attachment theory is something that still continues to get a, a lot of research and a lot of focus, uh, in counseling psychotherapy and, and psychology. And attachment theory, uh, springing from the concept of object relations, the, the important relationship between the primary caregiver and the child, uh, in, in the initial stages of upbringing. Attachment theory looks at that same sort of thing. It puts it under the heading of the attachment or connection between the primary caregiver and, and the child. And how secure the attachment is is going to influence greatly, uh, the emotional state and well-being of the individual later on in life. Okay? There's a developmental trajectory that is shown through research that insecure forms of attachment could potentially have a negative influence on the person's state and disposition as an adult. And it can also have a significant influence on how the person will function in relationships later on in life as well. Which, in turn, can be a place for encouraging anxiety within itself, within the present relationship that an adult might be in. That might also be a place where in, in, in, anxiety is encouraged because of the type of relationship that is. And so, the, the attachment concept is whereby, if a child, uh, is, is developed in the concept of a, of, of a environment that is safe, that is fulfilling, that is considerate and loving and concerning for the infant, well, then, that is going to give what, uh, attachment theorists would consider a secure base, uh, from which to develop and grow. Uh, and it, and it, and it testifies to the importance of, uh, the child's relationship with primary carers where there does need to develop a sense of security and safety and, and a sense of, uh, hope for, uh, the fact that the world can be a place whereby needs are fulfilled and relationships can be healthy and constructive. And then, in the context of that secure attachment, uh, there, there are feelings that are, that are constructive and, and healthy. But in insecure attachment, there is certainly the development of anxiety.

Video Lecture 2: Part A: Interpersonal Considerations in Personality and Anxiety Erikson's Stages of Psychosocial Development 1-4 

00:07:55
CLIVE JONES And now we're, we're looking again at the, at the development of theories relating to the interpersonal that are stemming from an understanding of the intrapersonal. And so, moving from Freud's fundamental theory of the intrapersonal conflicts, but then moving from that into the social interaction and the interpersonal reaction with significant others, we've got a, a, a key theorist and therapist here, uh, in, in Erikson and his stages of psychosocial development. And as the name implies, psychosocial, that term is linking the 'psych' with the 'social' and the interaction between the two. So, he would suggest, he's calling the 'psych' focus in his theory, uh, the 'ego'. Okay? That part of the intrapersonal aspect of personality that we are consciously aware of and that interacts and dialogues with others. Okay? And so, the psycho being that part of the intra, which is the ego, and the social being the interpersonal relationship with others. Now, interestingly, Erikson considered the trajectory of development in the context of the lifespan. And so, he said, look we, we need to look beyond just childhood, in terms of the interpersonal reaction and how this affects our state of being. And so, what Erikson has proposed is a trajectory course which charts specifically different areas of concern and focus across the lifespan. These elements can be quite useful in the context of counseling, uh, in, in a range of issues, but certainly in the context of anxiety that has resulted from certain interpersonal relationships. Okay. So, we're going to have a look at some of these stages now. We've got quite a few stages here, and, uhm, I'll, I'll put up the first issue or stage. And this relates to when the child is, is very, very young in infancy. And it's a developmental stage where he's saying that there is a point of conflict, and the point of conflict is in how the relationship is going to turn out, and what the baby is going to conclude about life and about others in the context of that psychosocial interaction. Really important stuff here. And I'll just, I'll just put up what he says the first stage is in infancy: trust versus mistrust. One thing about these stages is that they start at certain times, as Erikson proposes. They start at certain times, but then, once they start, there is something that we always need to negotiate throughout our life. When we're on this side of the coin, uh, you'll start to see something unfolding that's going to encourage negative emotions, hurtful emotions, of anxiety and despair and hopelessness. And so, a whole link between anxiety and depression actually. And then on this side, uh, you'll see, as the stages unfold in a positive way, that it's going to develop within an individual a sense of hope and purpose and, and a sense of significance and, and value, uh, and an appreciation of life and a joy of social interaction. So, you can see this psychosocial interaction between the individual and the ego state and the other person. This is how we'll look, then, at this trust versus mistrust area. What Erikson is suggesting here is that in the initial stages of the relationship that a, a child has with their primary caregivers, they're getting to understand whether or not the world is a trustworthy place. When I cry, as babies do, what will be your response? Can I trust that my needs are going to be looked after? Can I trust that it's going to be okay for tomorrow? Can I, can I trust the world? That's what Erikson is suggesting here. Where there's mistrust, there is despair and a sense of hopelessness. Where we feel that we cannot trust, and where we feel that there's not necessarily going to be any hope for tomorrow, how does a baby conclude that? What Erikson suggests is that when we're feeling that our needs are never going to be met, if a baby is crying and laying there, they'll start to get a perception of, nothing's going to change. Nothing's going to be different. My tummy pain for hunger is going to stay. If a baby's crying because it's cold and it doesn't get wrapped up, then a growing perception of, no matter what I do, it's not going to change anything. No matter how much I cry, no matter how much I kick up a stink, no matter how much I try to make someone realize that I need my nappy changed, that I need to be wrapped up, that I need food. If the connection is not caring and is not responding to the baby in a positive way, well, then there is the potential of this growing sense of mistrust in the world and a growing sense of helplessness and hopelessness and vulnerability in the world. Whereby, uh, the child will start to grow and develop feeling that they don't have any control in life's circumstances. And having a sense of not being in control and having a sense of not being able to influence your own life, that is certainly a significant place for anxiety to develop and grow. When we're feeling out of control and not able to do anything about anything, uh, then that's where we can get anxious. So, when we're looking at here, trust versus mistrust, uh, Erikson is saying, "This is a vital time where primary carers need to fulfill the needs of, of children and babies." Ah, and what, we need to have that sense that, if we make a noise, it will have an influence. Uh, basically, that's, that's an important element of trust versus mistrust, and that continues on. Now, we have here the, the, the concept of either autonomy versus shame and doubt. Now, this is an area that Erikson suggests develops in toddlerhood, and what happens here a lot of folks say that's like the terrible twos. And the terrible twos is a place where a child starts to establish their autonomy, and it's often where they really get to understand the word no. And a lot of folks suggest that, that that's where the child is exercising their autonomy, where they're starting to see they are different from other people around them. Now, when a child starts to do that, starts to assert their autonomy, and starts to communicate that they are different; No, mommy, I don't want to do that. No, daddy, I don't want to do that. Now, all that that in regard to healthy discipline and, and guiding and encouraging the child on to behaviors that are constructive in a loving way, that needs to be dealt with. But on the other side of the coin, if a child starts to feel that who they are as an individual is wrong or something they should be ashamed of or something that is bad, well, then they're going to start to develop within themselves a sense of shame or doubt. They're going to start to feel that who they are is wrong, what they do is inappropriate. And so, how a child is disciplined and how a child is guided through that stage of their life is very important to encourage a sense of autonomy, a sense of them understanding that they are a unique individual and feeling comfortable with that and safe in being that and accepted in being that. Or a sense of shame in regard to who they are, and a sense of doubt in their capacity to live life and experience life. And so, in that sense, it's, it's a, a child will explore outside the primary caregiver. It's where the child gets mobile as well. So, it sort of links in with the, with the physical, where a child is able to walk around a lot more. And so, in, in the context of that experience, they start to see that they're separate from, from their mum and dad or their primary caregiver. And so, that, that experience within itself starts to develop that sense of autonomy even more, when they can start to walk in the opposite direction of, of their primary caregiver and, and they to realize, wow. I have made a choice within myself to go over there instead of there. Now, often it can misinterpreted as being defiant. And it's very difficult to work out in developing children, you know, when is it defiant and when is it an expression of autonomy? And being able to respond and discipline and put boundaries in place in order to have the child feel that sense of autonomy, but without feeling threatened or concerned about, uh, exercising that autonomy. If a child, for example, walks in the opposite direction and they're made to feel ashamed about that, they're made to feel very doubtful about their choice of that, then that could encourage a growing level of anxiety within the child. What we're looking at here is a continuum of degrees. Okay? And when we're looking at this, often parents can start to feel guilty, oh, my goodness. You know, I, I, I'm making my child feel ashamed and doubtful and mistrustful. You know, we've, we discipline in the wrong way. And the aim is not to be a cowardly parent and, and, and establish our own forms of anxiety. The aim is, in this context, it just helps us to be aware. And it is on a continuum of degree. And what we're looking at with high levels of anxiety, we're looking at very severe cases of mistreatment and so forth that's happening in order to have a child feel shameful, doubtful. And, and what this does, in a sense, it charts the course of abusive relationships in childhood and how that can end up causing significant levels of anxiety in adulthood. Uh, that's what this is looking at. Not normal issues that happen between children and parents. Those sorts of things can generally be worked through. We're looking at, at, at intense cases of, that can encourage severe levels of shame and doubt and mistrust. And it is on a continuum of degree as well. And I know, as a parent, there's times when I've had my kid feel shameful and doubtful about themselves, uhm, just being a parent, you know, it can happen. Uh, now, we're looking at the third, and this is in middle childhood. Uh, actually, the third one is, uh, uh, early childhood and then the fourth one is middle childhood. And we're looking at initiative versus, versus guilt. Initiative is when a child is not going to dig a hole. They just want to take the initiative, so they're going to shovel and start digging a hole in the backyard. One of my children took the initiatives of sawing the leg of one of our antique pieces of furniture that was handed down from my, uh, from my wife's great-great-grandmother, and he took the initiative just to saw the leg off. There was not a reason for it. He just took the initiative. Okay? At early childhood stage, children take the initiative. How the psychosocial relationship is with the child, it could have, how we responded as parents to that could have the child feel very, very guilty. Now, for sure, the child has to realize that you don't go doing that, but the degree and intensity of guilt. A child has the initiative. Okay? It might not be defiance. It just might be that response of initiative. Another child just might decide, as I said before, dig a hole in the backyard. They might have gone past a building site and seen some, some builders digging a hole, and they thought they'd take the initiative to do the same. The concept of initiative is where we just try things out without any nec-, without, it's not goal-directed. It's not aiming to achieve anything in particular. It's just about doing it. Taking the initiative to start something to do something. And often what can happen is, uhm, when working with adults with anxiety, it can often be where a person is anxious over taking initiative. Where a person is anxious over taking the initiative to start up a conversation with somebody. Feeling too guilty about what they might say and what they're going to do. Where a person might be feeling anxious over taking initiative in starting a new job or taking the initiative to go for that job interview in the first place. Ah, where there might be people in a team talking about ideas and strategies, and there might be some people in there that are feeling anxious about taking the initiative to speak up about an idea. Okay? To, to just start doing something. And so, in seeing their health from this, if, in the context of relationships, we get this sense of feeling guilty about taking the initiative on things. Uhm, I can give the example, uh, we had to discipline our child when he sawed the legged off, but, my goodness, we weren't going to give him a bash over the ear, and we weren't going to push him, and we weren't going to slam the door in his face and tell him that he's a stupid idiot. And, you know, that sort of thing, uhm, is definitely going to have a child feel unnecessarily guilty. And it's going to have them feel anxious about taking initiative in the future because they're going to presume that, if they take initiative, people are going to respond like that. Okay? And so, it's that cognition. It's a perception of the world that starts to develop in the context of the psychosocial relationship. So, that's the initiative versus guilt. And now we're going to the, uhm, to the middle childhood stage, industry versus, we have industry versus inferiority. This is the shift moving from the initiative whereby the child then starts to take some industry. Industry is where it's goal-directed. So, it's not just about digging a hole. It's digging a hole for a reason or a purpose. It's giving meaning to the action of the initiative, uh, and starts a development from there. And this is where, uh, children really start to become productive, and, and they, they do want to do things that have end results. My child, at the industry stage, actually said, after we got together and we built the dog a dog kennel, uhm, he actually said, "That was the most productive thing I've ever done in my life." And I thought, wow what a sense of industry he felt there. Um, and what it also made him feel was a sense of achievement, a sense of satisfaction, as opposed to feeling inferior. Okay. If we are to squash industry, if somebody is to move towards something, if I had a, I'll tell you, it can be hard as a parent. You know, if a nail's not nailed in straight, if the sawing's not done to our liking, if the paint had a few drips on it, we could potentially be tempted to really squash that industry of purpose, uhm, and have the person or the child start to feel inferior. Uhm, and, and that inferiority can go back to Adler's concept of an inferiority complex, and it can feel like that. But it can also, you know, in the context of the present situation that the child might be in, have them feel inferior and have them feeling, uh, anxious in the context of not being able to deal with life properly. You know, that when they actually, uh, button down to do something, it doesn't work out right. People are unhappy with it, people are angry about it, people don't like it. And so, in that sense, a person can start to develop a, a, a feeling of anxiety and are threatened if they're asked to do something and, and produce something. They can feel scared about having to be asked to do that because they will feel, it's only going to end up in me feeling inferior. What's the point of trying? And so, we've got anxiety and also depression that often go close together, and you can see where it could go either way with that. But we're just sticking with the anxiety in this case. So, that's the industry versus the inferiority. Now we're looking at, uhm, we're moving into areas of adulthood.
