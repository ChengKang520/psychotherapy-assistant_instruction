DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Stress. Just hearing the word can sometimes conjure up different images and feelings. And because it can affect our clients like that, we, in the helping professions need to be able to help them understand what stress is, as well as be able to work with them to create personalized lifestyle changes to aid in stress reduction. Now, because stress affects our clients differentially, an event that may be stressful for one client such as giving a presentation at an international conference may actually be exciting for another client. They're really looking forward to it. So, a major goal is to help our clients learn to recognize their own unique sources and symptoms of stress, so they can create personalized lifestyle changes that work for them. Hi. I'm Dr. Edna Brinkley. I'm a Psychologist in Independent Practice and I also do training and consulting in stress management and cultural competence. Now, over the years, I've worked with a variety of clients who either presented with stress or others who said, "Just make all my stress go away". For example, university students, faculty and staff, librarians, dentists, business people, and even inmates at a federal prison. Now, what this says to me is that a lot of people, myself included, want to understand how to cope and better manage the stressors of your lives. And since it's well known that negative stress effects can decrease our quality of life, I'd like to share with you some research inform, information and techniques put together in a straightforward format that I have found effective. I hope it will help you in you work with clients who present with stress. Also, our clients, no matter how they self identify, see the world through their own cultural lenses. Some clients may prefer information or techniques to allow them to understand the work within the stressors and they don't consider them to be an issue to be overcome or explained. You'll need to find out and adapt to how your clients want to approach stress management. Now, my style. I'm very active because I, I'm sharing a lot of information. I also take a more solution-oriented and practical application approach because I found that clients want a relevant and user-friendly information that they can start using immediately. For those reasons, I incorporate three major areas in my treatment plan. I emphasize psychoeducation; that is a big one. I want my clients to have good information. Physiological understanding and management; that's number two. And cognitive restructuring; that's number three. I include these three areas because I think it's important for clients to know what's happening in their bodies, as well as in their minds. So, we'll be focusing on educating your clients so they can make good choices as they go about creating their own personalized stress management lifestyle. And yes, this is a different way of life. It's like if someone has diabetes, you have to change the way you live to manage and improve its symptoms to keep yourself healthy. It's the same with stress. A couple of more things. I want to mention that these are truncated and accelerated parts of sessions. And your work, you'll need to allow more time in your sessions; maybe a lot more. Now, that's going to allow you to make sure you have adequate time to explain and explore all the information that will be presented here. And last. The main purpose of this video is to show you how to work with someone who presents with distress, which is acute or chronic stress, which are the harmful types of stress, especially chronic. We will not focus on new stress, the positive and less harmful type. Now, this is what we'll be doing. I'm seeing four clients tomorrow and all of them presented with stress and they're all in different stages of change regarding it. Each client is also at a different stage in treatment. As you review the vignette, you will learn how to create a shared frame of reference about stress, how stress affects the body, the effects of chronic stress, how to identify clients' unique sources and symptoms of stress, and some stress reduction strategies. Well, it looks like I've got a lot of planning to do for tomorrow. So, I need to get back to my office and get started. I'll see you tomorrow.

PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA  My name is Emiko Hasegawa and I'm 53 years old. I'm a Professor of Educational Psychology at the local university. I was born and raised in Sapporo, Japan and moved to the United States to attend university in Chicago, which is where I met my future husband, Ignacio(ph). When I was a senior in college, my parents asked me when I would be returning home, and then told me they had arranged an omiyai for me, that's an arranged marriage. First, I told them I wasn't returning to Japan and then I told them I couldn't go through with the marriage. To this day, I don't think they've ever forgiven me and especially when I married Ignacio(ph). He died, he died a couple of years ago and my parents didn't really acknowledge that either. Over the past year, my stress level has really increased. I went to see my doctor and she wanted me to put, she wanted to put me on medication but I asked what else I could do. So, she suggested seeing someone. Here I am with a degree in Psychology and I don't know what to do, but I'm willing to consider something different right now, especially since I needed to figure out what to do when I go visit my parents back in Japan in a couple of months. 

00:05:50
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  In this section, I'll be working with a client, Dr. Hasegawa. She's a Psychology Professor at the local university. Part of what we're working on today is to create a shared frame of reference. Now, what that means is that we'll be discussing how she thinks about stress and how psychologists think about it and then together we'll come up with a working definition of stress. So, that when we talk about it from now on, we'll be using the same meaning. One more thing, it's critical at the outset to find out from your clients whether they want to understand stress in the broad sense, whether they want to learn some coping strategies or a combination. Now, join me as I work with Dr. Hasegawa to create a shared frame of reference. 

00:06:35
Third Session Contemplation Stage Ask for client's definition 

00:06:35
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Well, Professor, let's go to the second topic at our agenda for today. In our session last week, we discussed spending some of our time together today looking at stress in your life. I'd like to start off by asking, " When you think about stress, how do you define it? Wa, what kinds of thoughts come to mind when you think about it? 

00:06:55
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA Well, when I think about stress, all I can think of is pressure, pressure from everywhere, from a job, the department chair, all the committees I am on and then there is my parents. You know, they are much older now and want me to be closer to them. Well, there's more, but just even starting to think about it now, my body feels so tight and, well, stressed. Sometimes, I just want to run away, go somewhere and have a good cry. I guess at the end of the day, all I can think of is, "I want to relax" and then I try, but my mind won't shut up. I keep on thinking about all the things I still have to do, well, what I have to do the next day. 

00:07:40
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Sounds like overwhelm for you right now. 

00:07:45
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA That's a good word for it. 

00:07:45
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY And also, your ideas about stress, they're really right on target. You mentioned how your body feels all tight, and then you mentioned wanting to run away, wanting to go some place and cry. Ah, and then you mentioned that your mind won't shut up. Now, those are all indications of some symptoms of stress. And it also sounds like the way you're thinking about the stresses in your life, it's also affecting your body, your mind, (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA Hmm. 

00:08:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY and, and what you do. Let's see if we can come up with a working definition that's gonna be helpful to you. So, bear with me just a little bit here. 

00:08:15
Explain stress vs. stressor 

00:08:15
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  I wanna start off by saying when most people talk about stress what they're actually talking about is, is what's called stressors. 

00:08:25
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA Stressors? That's different. So, what are stressors? 

00:08:30
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Well, stressors are simply ah, internal or external conditions or situations. Ah, internal, because for example, you said your mind, it won't shut up and you end up feeling pressure. It's not anything going on outside of you. It's your mind that's precipitating the stress symptoms. (crosstalk) 

00:08:45
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA Hmm. 

00:08:45
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY So, it's what you're thinking and saying to yourself. But for external, now that's something in our environment. It's something outside of us. So, stressors can be negative thoughts, ah, events, ah, people, situations, traffic, like that. 

00:09:05
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA It sounds like you are saying, stressors are like the different sources or causes of stress in my life. 

00:09:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Right. Right. 

00:09:10
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA So, there are stressors and stress, too; kind of confusing. 

00:09:15
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Yeah. You're right about that, too. It is a bit confusing especially when you start trying to define stress. I mean, ah, a lot of what we read and hear today it's still says stress is really only about what happens to our bodies and how under stress, they get thrown out of homeostasis or, or balance. But stress isn't just about our bodies. We also need to pay attention to, and, and you've already mentioned this, to our mind. 

00:09:40
Offer "working definition" 

00:09:40
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY So, one way to think about stress, is that it's how the mind and the body, so, so you as a total being, how you respond or react to a new or constant demand or thought, ah, situation, event or person and it's a based on your perception of those. So, if you think about it it's a mind-body experience in response. 

00:10:05
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA Mind-body huh. On the face of it, that make sense. 

00:10:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY And, and what's key here, it's our perception. 

00:10:10
Introduce perception 

00:10:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Sometimes, when our perception of a demand, or something that needs our attention, outweighs our perception of our ability to cope, we start to experience in different symptoms of stress. So, stress is based on our perception, the meaning we give to different situations. 

00:10:25
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA  My perception huh. And what do you mean I give meaning to these situations? 

00:10:35
Explain "giving meaning" 

00:10:35
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Well, uhm, we give meaning to situations by, ah, hmm, ah, for example, ah, drawing on past experiences with a similar situation, ah, maybe some beliefs and values from our family or, or cultural background, (crosstalk) 

00:10:45
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA Hmm. 

00:10:45
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY ...maybe even some fears about the future. Basically, what we're trying to do, we're trying to make sense of things. And so, we try to frame it ah, make the new situation make sense bakes, based on what we already know. And by the way, we're the only ones that can give meaning to those different situations. 

00:11:05
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA So, are you saying I'm giving meaning to it by trying to understand the situation and using my life as a guide so I can then do something about it? 

00:11:15
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Yes. That's right. Uhm, I know you like examples. Have you ever heard the story that there are some people who love public speaking while others, they get weak in the knees just thinking about it? 

00:11:30
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA Yes. I've heard of that. You know, teaching needs public speaking and I love teaching. I really enjoy being in front of a class and seeing students' eyes light up when they get it. I couldn't do my job well if I couldn't get up in the front of the class. 

00:11:45
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Exactly. So, for you the meaning you give to giving lectures, its excitement. You love it. It energizes you and you look forward to it. Right? 

00:11:55
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA Yeah. I do. And even after class, I'm still excited. I have ah, all this energy. So, I use that to write my next lecture and get some other work done. 

00:12:05
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Hmm. So, for you, being in front of a crowd energizes you. But for others, well, they'd rather have a root canal with no anesthesia than give a lecture. So, the meaning they give to this situation is based maybe on past experiences of having to do this and their fears about having to do it again. So, their belief becomes, "This is gonna be stressful and I don't wanna have anything to do with it". 

00:12:30
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA Let me think about this a minute. 

00:12:30
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. 

00:12:30
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA  So, here is my example, so I can make use, ah, you sure I understand what you're saying. 

00:12:40
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. 

00:12:40
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA You remember I had to put my car in the shop a few weeks ago? 

00:12:45
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Yeah. 

00:12:45
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA And I mentioned how worried I was about it. Well, you know, money is a little tight these days, and I wasn't looking forward to a new expense. I remember my mind was going crazy with all these thoughts and fears about how I was going to pay for this and hay, how I was going to get to campus. But then, I realized there's a bus, bus stop near my house. And with my university ID, I can ride the bus for free. 

00:13:15
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Hmm. Alright. 

00:13:15
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA So, I decided to start riding the bus a lot more. Later, I found out, the repairs weren't that expensive. Things didn't seem so bad then. 

00:13:25
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  Precisely. So, let's add your perception of a situation and your belief and whether you have the ability to take care of it in a timely, efficient manner. Let's add that to our working definition of stress. If you believe you can take care of it, you're less likely to suffer the stress effects. But, if not, well, the stress reaction, it's gonna kick in, which means that you now begin to experience the physical and the psychological effects. How is this sounding to you? 

00:13:55
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA It makes sense right now. Later, I'm not so sure. 

00:14:00
Assign homework 

00:14:00
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. I hear ya. Uhm, let's make this an outside assignment moment. Your outside assignment for next week is to continue thinking about your own definition of stress. Ah, the working definition you'd come up with and the idea that your mind and your perception are involved. And also, now, now this may seem a little different. I want you to think about how when you were growing up in Japan, how did people around you express and deal with stress? Was stress even a part of the way they thought about stress, (crosstalk) 

00:14:30
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA Hmm. 

00:14:30
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY uhm, and a thought about life? Sorry. I also want you to think about that in comparison to how you think about stress today. How does that sound to you. 

00:14:40
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA  Sounds okay. I can do that. Interesting. I've never considered a Japanese aspect to this. 

00:14:50
Explore any cultural beliefs 

00:14:50
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Well, it's not really a Japanese aspect per se. I ask all my clients to think back to where they grew up. And the reason I ask them to do that is because much of what we learned it's really informally transmitted to us from significant people in our lives, whether we're raised in Japan, Mexico City, Chicago. And what we learn can influence the way we see and think about things. I just want you to reflect back, see if anything is there. There may or may not be. 

00:15:15
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA  Well, I'll think about it and see what's comes up. 

00:15:20
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY It's fair enough. Ahh, would you be willing to try and experiment with me as a way to get you started on your outside activity for next week? 

00:15:30
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA Ahh, okay. What do I do? 

00:15:35
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. Ah, I like you to get comfortable. Uhm, shake your body out a little bit if you need to. Okay. Uhm, tell me, how are you feeling right now? 

00:15:45
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA Well, I was feeling okay, but as soon as you say we are going to do something different, I started feeling a little nervous, a little anxious. I'm not sure what you want me to do. 

00:15:55
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Of course, you're being asked to do something different. You're not sure what it is so, it makes perfect sense that from that uncertainty, you might be feeling a little nervous, maybe a little anxious, which are two symptoms of someone experiencing stress effects. 

00:16:10
Practice scale activity 

00:16:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. I want you to visualize in your mind's eye a scale that's balanced and even. Okay. Now, I'd like you to think about some of the life skills, ah, some of your strengths and some coping strategies the helpful ones, mind you, okay, ah, that you already have and ah, well, can you name a few of those for me, please. 

00:16:30
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA  Well, I'm a pretty good professor. I've won several student-nominated awards. I speak four languages. When I see something I want, I create a plan to get it. My checkbooks is always balanced. I know how to do basic repairs at home, so, I don't have to call someone every time I need something. And I have a several close friends that I see regularly. How's that? 

00:17:00
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Sounds great. Uhm, how are you feeling right now? 

00:17:05
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA I'm feeling pretty good, less nervous now. 

00:17:05
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Good. Now, I want you to continue thinking about the scale. Okay, right now, it's probably tilted to one side with your life skills, your strengths, your coping strategies. Okay. So, you've got some strengths and abilities in your favor, and that's really great. Now, I want you to tell me about some of the things that have been going on in your life lately. 

00:17:25
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA Well, my car needed some repairs recently. I've got to write two exams after I leave here today, plus, have office hours I'm chairing a new committee that has its first meeting tomorrow. So, I have to prepare for that. I pulled a muscle exercising last week and it's still giving me a little trouble. My younger sister, Mia, called and wants to borrow money again. And she hasn't even paid me back from the last time. And yesterday, I found some extra charges on my credit card and I didn't make them. So, I have to deal with that. And remember, I'm planning on visiting my parents in Japan in a couple of months. 

00:18:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY How are you feeling now? 

00:18:10
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA  Well, not as good as before; feeling kind of heavy and anxiety has kicked back in. 

00:18:20
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Yeah. If you think about the scale now I'll bet it's tilted to the other side and weighed it down. Ah, to let you know, this arm of the scale represented your sources of stress right now and what you experienced are some of the classic symptoms of stress. The first arm of the scale that was coping strategies, some skills and some strengths. Was that the way it looked to you in your mind's eye? 

00:18:40
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA  Yeah. The first arm came down some but when I talked about what's causing my stress, the second, second arm kicked in and went all the way down. 

00:18:55
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Well, you definitely had that image down. What do you think happened? What do you think caused the arms to shift like that? 

00:19:00
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA Well, I guess, No, not I guess. It's obvious. I'm not handling my stress right. I know that's why my family doctor suggested I see you. She thought it might help. Apparently, how I've been coping isn't working for what's going on in my life now. I remember you said something about that last week. What was it? Something new comes along and challenges the strategy I usually use. I think that's what you said. So, I guess what I have is in, im, imbalance between what's going on and how I usually cope. And so, of course, I start to feel different symptoms of stress. I get off balance, I lose my homeostasis. That even makes sense to me now. 

00:19:50
Suggest mindbody connection 

00:19:50
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY You got it. And something you may not have noticed, this all happened in your mind, yet you had a physical reaction. See, your body doesn't know the difference between something real and something imagined. But it will react and different symptoms may appear. And that's what I want you to continue thinking about for the next week. 

00:20:15
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA Yeah. Okay. There may be something to this. That was good. That make sense. I've never thought about that before. 

00:20:20
Suggest bibliotherapy 

00:20:20
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. I'm also sensing that it's time to move on to the next topic on our agenda. So, what I'd like to do is to give you a couple of books and some handouts about stress before you leave today. And I want you to read as much of it as you can for next week. Ah, I also want you to think about what we've talked about earlier. 

00:20:40
PROF. EMIKO HASEGAWA Okay. I think it even might be helpful for me to meet some more and I'm definitely going to make time to do it. 

00:20:45
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Good. In this section, I worked with Dr. Hasegawa to create a shared frame of reference about stress by asking her definition of stress, sharing some psychological definitions of stress, providing a working definition of stress, explaining the difference between stress and stressor, introducing the concept of perception and meaning making and their relationship to stress, exploring some of her current strengths, giving her an outside assignment so she will continue to think about her current definition and whether it has any relationship to how stress was thought about while growing up in Japan, plus, some bibliotherapy in the form of handouts and a couple of books. 

00:21:30
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Stop and role play creating a shared frame of reference. Use the handout provided for suggestions and questions to use during the role play. 

00:21:40
TAYLOR GAERTNER My name is Taylor Analise(ph) Gaertner. I'm 18-years-old. I was born on a military base in Germany when my mom was stationed there and she met my dad who is German. My dad taught me German, but my mom still only speaks a little. Right now, I'm a first year undergraduate majoring in Chemical Engineering. I think I want to go into pharmaceuticals, but I haven't decided yet. I have a girlfriend named Chelsea. We've been together three years and we see each other pretty regularly especially since we're on the same campus. But she's a sophomore and has a different major, so, we don't have any classes together. My university is predominantly white, and lately it's become more difficult to be here. All of my professors, except for one, is white, and most of my classmates are, too. I started to feel very visible and exposed, and I've never really felt that way before. I wanna make friends but it seems like the White students are in cliques. This semester has been tougher than last. A few weeks ago, one of my white male professors told me I didn't belong in his department. But it's a required class, so, I have to stay in it. In general, going to see professors for office hours has been really stressful, and I don't know what to do. I'm so stressed from school and I wanna understand why my body is having all these feelings when I have to go to office hours. 

00:23:05
[sil.] 

00:23:05
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  In this section, I'll be working with a client, Taylor Gaertner, who just happens to be an undergraduate at the same university that Dr. Hasegawa teaches at. Taylor and I will be exploring how stress affects physiologically. The reason we're doing this is because Taylor has a lot of physical symptoms and wants to understand where they're coming from. Plus, she says, "How do you get rid of them?" I've also suggested to her that by being able to recognize when and why she's experiencing stress symptoms, later it will be easier for her to also learn and use relaxation techniques, because she'll know the difference between how feeling stressed feels versus how feeling relaxed feels. Now, join me as I work with Taylor to discuss how stress affects her physiologically. 

00:23:55
Fourth Session 

00:23:55
TAYLOR GAERTNER  Dr. B, I think I'm getting a better understanding of stress and how it's affecting my life. 

00:24:00
Preparation stage 

00:24:00
TAYLOR GAERTNER  But I wanna know what's going on inside me. I mean the stuff you gave me last week was interesting to read and it said that stress is related to all sorts of diseases like diabetes, ulcers and high blood pressure. My dad just told me last month that my mom has diabetes and high blood pressure... (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Hmmm. 

00:24:20
TAYLOR GAERTNER ...and that she has been on medication for the past two years. 

00:24:20
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  Wow. 

00:24:25
TAYLOR GAERTNER Well, we've kind of talked about how my mom doesn't exactly share our family's medical history with me. So, I've gotta be proactive and do something on my own. I figure that the more I know about how stress is affecting my mody, body, the better. Right? 

00:24:35
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Yeah. Okay. Ah, let me share something with you that I found working with others, from, from working with others who have also had diabetes and high blood pressure, and it also might relate to your mom. I found that what's going on for them, part of what's going on for them is that in the beginning, they were actually trying to find ways to deal with the stressors in their lives and, and that's a good thing. But, but something went wrong. For example, I've had a clients who said, they had a lot of job stress and they tried to cope by going the happy hour with their co-workers. They said it was to unwind. And when some of them later realize was that they're gaining weight. Happy hour seem to extend later and later into the night and after a while, happy hour, it wasn't as happy as it used to be. (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
TAYLOR GAERTNER Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
Suggest wise strategy choice 

00:25:20
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY So their initial strategy to cope was not as effective it could've been because now, in addition to the job stress, they've got some big extra; the weight gain and the extra drinking to deal with. So it can become a vicious cycle if you're not choosing how to strategize at the outset. So, Dr. B's words for the day, "choose your strategies wisely or else you may unintentionally create a new stressor". But you wanted to understand more about stress physiology. 

00:25:45
TAYLOR GAERTNER Well yeah, not to ask you... (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Oh! Okay, okay, okay. 

00:25:50
TAYLOR GAERTNER ...but so what's going on with my body. I remember that fight or flight thing you were talking about where you see a bear in the woods and you either fight it or run away. And now I remember somebody from school and I'm taking a bio class this semester too. So help me figure out what's going on? 

00:26:05
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Uh! Okay. Where to start. I wanna mention there's two ways to think about what's going on. Ah, so let's start off and talk about the more traditional one, the, the one you've already mentioned us, "see the bear in the woods" one. 

00:26:15
Review basic biology 

00:26:15
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  And since you are members on biology, we're gonna skip over the central nervous system and jump right to the autonomic nervous system, where the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems are. How about that? 

00:26:30
TAYLOR GAERTNER Yeah, yeah. This was finely(ph) familiar. The sympathetic nervous system is where the fight or fight thing happens, right? 

00:26:35
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Right. 

00:26:35
TAYLOR GAERTNER And the parasympathetic is the counter to that. 

00:26:40
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Right on both. And remember, the parasympathetic nervous system responses are under our control. And that's what we'll be influencing when we do some relaxation techniques later. 

00:26:45
Use open-ended questions 

00:26:45
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  Okay. You were in class earlier today, did anything happen? 

00:26:50
TAYLOR GAERTNER  Not in class, but I did go see Dr. See(ph) for office hours after class. Like I said before, she's a really good professor, but I get so nervous and tongue tied around her and I feel so embarrassed. Looks like I forget everything from class... (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Uhm. 

00:27:05
TAYLOR GAERTNER . . .and I fumble with my notes. She must think I'm an idiot. 

00:27:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Dr. See(ph), that's Dr. Jena(ph) Paulie(ph), right? She's your intro to biology professor, isn't she? 

00:27:15
TAYLOR GAERTNER Yeah. Good memory. 

00:27:15
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Oh! Thanks. Since we're sticking just with physiology right now, here it goes. 

00:27:20
Remind: perception/meaning 

00:27:20
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  You're going to Dr. See's(ph) office and be perception, and meaning, you give to the situation is that it's gonna be stressful, and you'll end up embarrassing yourself. So you've already set those thoughts in motion before you even go to her office. With those thoughts, you're setting yourself up for the stress response to kick in. Now with that perception, the autonomic nervous system is gonna become more active. I mean, it's active anyway because of the involuntary functions like regulating the muscles, our heart, our lungs, and glands. But now, it's becoming a lot more active, and mainly, the sympathetic nervous system, part of it. Are you with me. 

00:28:00
TAYLOR GAERTNER Yeah. 

00:28:00
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. So what I mean is once your mind perceives something as a stressor, it only takes a few seconds for the stress response to kick in. It's like a hormonal cascading waterfall. It is automatic and we cannot control it, because remember, your mind has perceived something as a stressor. And the body, it doesn't know the difference between something real and something imagined, but it's gonna react. So with your sympathetic nervous system, a lot of things are gonna happen very quickly, just like on this handout here. I brought a handout for you here today, and- 

00:28:30
Discuss sympathetic N.S. 

00:28:30
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY - why don't you take a look, ah, we have some of those on the stress part. 

00:28:35
TAYLOR GAERTNER Okay. Well there's an increase in my heart rate and my blood pressure... (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. Yeah. 

00:28:40
TAYLOR GAERTNER ...in the chest area.(crosstalk) 

00:28:40
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Right. 

00:28:40
TAYLOR GAERTNER  And muscles will contract and arms and hands... (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY All right. 

00:28:45
TAYLOR GAERTNER ...and then the adrenals will release epinephrine, nor epinephrine and cortisol into the blood stream. So I know epinephrine and nor epinephrine, it make my heart rate and my blood pressure go up and give me extra energy. (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:00
TAYLOR GAERTNER And I've heard of cortisol, it's called the stress hormone, but what does it do? 

00:29:05
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Cortisol. Uhm. Basically, what it's doing, it takes the fats and the carbohydrates that we have stored in our body's and it sends them along with blood from our stomach and our kidney's to our brain, our muscles, and our lungs, so that basically, we're ready to, well, ah, beat up on something or somebody, or we can run away from them. But you know, it's a good thing that we have the cortisol because even though it is the stress hormone, it is also an anti-inflammatory because, well, we might get some scratches or cuts if we decide to beat up on something. 

00:29:35
TAYLOR GAERTNER And all these is happening when I go to see Dr. See(ph). Yeah, all those symptoms are just like me when I go see her. Well actually, this happens when I see all my professors not just her. 

00:29:50
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Yet there is not physical threat here. 

00:29:50
TAYLOR GAERTNER So what's going on? 

00:29:50
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  Good question. You want to go see your professor to get help with your classes, which is what a good student does. And you've already had, one professors say you don't belong in the department. Plus, you said last week, one of your professors who what, what did he say again? 

00:30:10
TAYLOR GAERTNER It was an American Government class. It's required and we were discussing public policy. The professor, his wife, and you know, as always, everybody else in the class too. Well anyway, he made a statement and he said, "let's hear what African-American students have to say about this." And then he looked straight at me and stood... (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Hmm. 

00:30:30
TAYLOR GAERTNER ...there like he was expecting me to say something. What's he looking at me for anyway? I didn't say anything. I just stared back at him and looked around the room at my classmates, and... (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Hmm. 

00:30:40
TAYLOR GAERTNER ...they were all staring at me too. I think I see what you're getting at, in that class and in the others too, there aren't any physical threats, but sometimes I feel like I'm being attacked in class verbally, sometimes body language too. So it sounds like even when there's not a physical threat, I still felt that to me, to who I am, how I think about myself. And so I feel I have to depend myself against all these negative images, the stereotypes. Huh. It's so tiring, and then the stress reaction kicks in. 

00:31:15
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Precisely. 

00:31:15
Affirm self-reflection 

00:31:15
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  Most of women makes the stress response kick in nowadays, it really is threats to us since yourself, our self esteem, our self-worth. So, it's a lot more psychological than physical. There's no physical threat here but the body is still reacting as if there were. And when your professors make a racist or a prejudicial statement, plus you're being in a hostile environment at the university. Well yeah, your body might react to that. So we're gonna need to revisit and spend more time talking about what you can do to survive and succeed in your classes and on your campus too. Because sometimes, you may have to put on heavier armor and inoculate yourself until you figure out what's best to do. 

00:31:55
TAYLOR GAERTNER Yeah, I'd like that. 

00:31:55
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. Good. 

00:31:55
TAYLOR GAERTNER I gotta think about this more too. I hadn't realize 'til I felt threatened and attacked by others before. Yeah, I gotta think about this more. 

00:32:05
Monitor understanding 

00:32:05
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. So how, how is all this sounding to you? 

00:32:10
TAYLOR GAERTNER Well it makes a lot of sense. All these physical symptoms. That's definitely me. I feel all those things on the handout, especially from the sweaty hands and heart rate going up. I don't know about my eyes dilating and the other stuff like... (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. 

00:32:25
TAYLOR GAERTNER ...the other stuff, definitely yes. 

00:32:25
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. 

00:32:25
TAYLOR GAERTNER And I do think I forget to breath sometimes. I guess this is because I'm just so wrapped up with everything else that's going on with the rest of my body, that the breathing just didn't happen. 

00:32:35
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Well, since you're recognizing that, that's gonna make it a lot easier for you to start monitoring it which is what I'd like you to start doing. Ah, and that's also gonna help us when we start practicing some abdominal breathing later. Ah, by the way Taylor, before you leave today, I wanna give you a handout on identifying you symptoms of stress, and it's gonna go into more detail about how to identify when you're experiencing stress symptom, especially the physical ones. So, ah, when you see it, you'll have a better idea of what I mean, and I'm gonna give that to you before you go. 

00:33:05
TAYLOR GAERTNER Dr. B, I think you mentioned another way, a new way of thinking about all of these, and that's gonna help me better understand and deal with my stress level. I definitely wanna know about that too. 

00:33:15
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. Basically, it's another way of thinking about the stress response, especially as it applies to women. 

00:33:20
TAYLOR GAERTNER I'm all for that. Maybe its something I can share with Chelsea(ph) and my mom. 

00:33:25
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Oh! Good idea. Now, we've been talking about fight or flight, and when you look at it, like this basically a battle. It's all fist-n-cuffs(ph). Where you encounter a new situation, you have physiological reaction and then if you're stronger or bigger you beat up on the new situation and if you're smaller, well you run away form it. The new thinking is that, although women and men both have a physiological response and, you love biology's, so I have to mention this. Our hormones, primarily oxytocin for women, testosterone for men, those are gonna influence what we do after that physiological reaction. So, the question for you is,- 

00:34:00
Query specific strategies 

00:34:00
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  -after you've seen Dr. See(ph) or another professor or... What do you usually do? How do you deal with having going to see them? 

00:34:10
TAYLOR GAERTNER Uhm. Well, I usually go back outside her office. . .(crosstalk) 

00:34:15
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Outside. 

00:34:15
TAYLOR GAERTNER . . .and meet a friend, and we talk about it. And then maybe we do some studying. That's about it while until later when I get home. I'll call Chelsea(ph), tell her all about it and we leave it again. I just promise myself it'll be better next time. 

00:34:30
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. Well let me say a little bit more about it and tell me what you think. Now, you've heard of oxytocin, right? 

00:34:35
TAYLOR GAERTNER Yeah. We talked about that in bio class a few weeks ago. It's the hormone involved in child birth, makes you feel more calm afterwards... (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Uh hmm. 

00:34:45
TAYLOR GAERTNER ...and calm in general. 

00:34:45
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Right. It's also what's called a bonding and social hormone. So you're still getting the physiological reaction, but what you're doing afterwards, it's not sounding like fight or flight to me. It's sounding more like what's called. "tending the friend". 

00:35:00
TAYLOR GAERTNER Tending the friend? 

00:35:00
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  Yeah. Ah, what that it is, you experience your stressor, sometimes it's not in your best interest to run away or engage the stressor. 

00:35:10
Importance of social support 

00:35:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY So, what you do is you're seeking out others to help you through it. You are drawing on your social network; Chelsea(ph), your friends, you parents, your favorite aunt Casey(ph), and you're using that support to help you. That's the befriending part. And the tending part is actually, you're nurturing yourself. Well, and if you two have kids.(crosstalk) 

00:35:30
TAYLOR GAERTNER Wait, we are not even thinking about having kids yet. 

00:35:35
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay, okay. Just an example. If you did have kids, and if you two had kids, you might notice that after a hard day, you might hug them a little tighter. You, you spend more time with them. You read them an extra bedtime story. You tend to them. And you might also notice that you're doing something extra special for yourself. So, tending the friend, a woman's response to stress. 

00:35:55
TAYLOR GAERTNER Oh! This is really interesting. I've never heard of this before. 

00:36:00
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Uhm. I wonder, since this is related to biology, I wonder if Dr. See(ph) knows about this. I mean- 

00:36:10
Encourage agency 

00:36:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY - you could go in and see you're about something unrelated to class. It's kind of like turning the tables and meeting her more on your own terms. I wonder how that would be for you? 

00:36:20
TAYLOR GAERTNER Go see her? Yeah. I guess I could do that. She might know something about it. 

00:36:25
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Well let me know how it goes. 

00:36:25
Assign homework 

00:36:25
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Also, Taylor, before you leave today, I've got a couple of books and some more reading for you that I wanna lend you. Ah, they go into more detail about, "tending the friend" plus stress physiology in general. 

00:36:35
TAYLOR GAERTNER Great. 

00:36:35
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  In this section, I worked with Taylor Gaertner to explore how stress affected her physiologically by reviewing the autonomic nervous system, identifying two of the major hormones involved in the stress response, explaining the difference between the "fight or flight" and "tend and defend" models, and assign the bibliotherapy. 

00:37:00
News Flash! Effects of the Chronic Stress 

00:37:00
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  There's a growing body of research that implicates stress and many disease and disorders. Some of which you can see here. 

00:37:30
Heart Disease Autoimmune Disease Vascular Hypertension Neurodegeneration Deficits In Spatial Memory Chronic Heart Failure Hypertension Hippocampal Atrophy Anxiety Major Depression Earlier Deterioration in Physical/Mental Functioning Diabetes Tension and Migraine Headaches Stomach and intestinal Problems Cardiovascular Disease Rheumatoid Arthritis Pains In Neck & Back None Mineral Loss Cancer Stroke Fibromyalgia Allergies Ulcers 

00:37:30
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  Earlier, Taylor and I talked about what's called acute or everyday stress. Something happens, you handle it, and then your body goes back to homeostasis or normal. What, what happens when the body is under chronic stress. In long term, going to down kind of stress. We've already seen some examples in the preceding list. So what I'd like to do now is share some more information you may want to discuss with your clients. When a person experiences chronic stress, for example, living in poverty, never having enough money to buy the basics or have healthcare, staying in an abusive relationship, being unemployed for a long time, or taking care of a parent with Alzheimer's disease. Well several things can happen. While your body is going to stay aroused, it will not return to homeostasis, so it continues to have elevated levels of adrenaline and cortisol, the stress hormones. Elevated cortisol levels in particular no longer act on the body to do certain things; damage the nerve cells in the hippocampal area of the brain such that your memory becomes effective, production of new hippocampal cells can also stop. By the way, the hippocampus, that's the part of the brain that indexes the context of different incoming events and helps you turn off the stress response after the event's over. Elevated cortisol levels could also put a lot more fat at your waist, which is going to put you at an increased risk of heart disease, cancer, and some other diseases. It can also lead to a weakened immune system. So you may be sick more often. Plus, leave yourself open to some opportunistic germ or virus to take up residence in your body. For example, an upper respiratory infection. It can also lead to the development of insulin resistance, and that's gonna put the person at risk to type II diabetes. Plus, it can interfere with serotonin levels, leaving the person vulnerable to developing; bingo! you got it. Clinical depression and anxiety disorders, with elevated adrenaline or your blood pressure will stay elevated. And that can lead to the blood vessels in the brain and the heart becoming damaged. Now this turn could lead to atherosclerosis, which puts the person at a major risk for strokes and heart attacks. And last, I want to mention telomeres. Because I want clients, I believe clients need to know the impact, the true impact of chronic stress. So, what are telomere's, these are the sections of DNA that are found at the bottom of our chromosomes. One way to explain it to your clients, individualize it yourself is that telomere's are like the plastic in parts on a shoelace. Under chronic stress, researchers have found that on a cellular level, telomere's, these caps on our chromosomes began shortening at an accelerated rate. This means, they don't fully replicate themselves, and as they get shorter and shorter, and shorter, that reach a point where they're short enough that their cells begin aging prematurely and then they die. Now what this looks like in layman terms, that's about a ten-year difference in the cells and the physical appearance of someone who has low stress or versus a high stress individual. One more thing. In addition to premature aging, shortened telomere's are also related to various cancers, like pancreatic, lung, prostate, and bone. 

00:42:20
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Stop and role-play discussing how stress affects us physiologically. Use the handout provided for suggestions and questions to use during the role play. 

00:42:30
LIAM CAMPBELL My name is Liam Matthew Campbell. I'm 65 years old and I have loved plane since I was a little boy. I've been working for Level(ph) Plane Rising International for almost 40 years. I worked myself up through the ranks, and now, I'm a flight desk inspector for military and business acquisition, disposal, and pre-practice for small cargo transport aircraft. I love what I do, but sometimes work with planes was a lot easier than working with people, and this people is starting to get to me. I lettered my company's EAP to talk about this but they said they had to refer me to the doctor, because what'd they say, because they didn't have the appropriate clinical staff. Anyway, I think I'm going, doing okay, otherwise, my wife and I celebrate our 40th wedding wedding anniversary recently. She has her own car dealership business and pretty good right now. She has been thinking of selling this so both of us can retire at the same time. We've got four kids, three grandkids that we don't see often enough. We're planning a trip to see our older grandkids in a couple of months. 

00:43:55
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY In this section, I'll be working with a client, Liam Campbell. He's a flight test inspector. He's told me that lately, his work situation has become more stressful and he's concern that since his job involves passenger safety, he better take a look at what's underlying his stress and do something about it. We'll be working together to identify the sources and symptoms of stress that are unique to his work and his life situation. That way, we can then decide what strategies or techniques will be the most appropriate to address his particular stressors and symptoms. For Liam's sources of stress, we'll look at areas such as physical, social, work-related and negative self talk. For stress symptoms, we'll look at areas such as physical, cognitive, and emotional. Now last week, I asked him to complete two checklist, and to add on any sources and symptoms that weren't listed on the sheet. You'll find the copy of the same checklist in the handouts for this section. Also, since some of his symptoms sounds similar to depression or a possible medical condition, we've started exploring those, and whether he needs to be referred for medication evaluation or to get a more recent physical. Now, join me as I work with Liam Campbell to identify and explore his unique sources and symptoms of stress. 

00:45:10
Fifth Session 

00:45:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  We finished the first few things in our agenda for today. So I think we can now start taking a look at your outside activity from last week. How was it to go through? Were you able to finish it? 

00:45:20
Preparation stage 

00:45:20
LIAM CAMPBELL  I'm used to doing check listing my work, but you said a lot of things I've never even thought about, and you got me to thinking. So I spend a lot of time with it. And I got to both of them. 

00:45:35
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. Ah, good. Let's, let's take a look at them. Thank you. 

00:45:45
LIAM CAMPBELL  (Sighs) Okay. By the way, I made you an extra copy so we can do it together. (laughs) 

00:45:50
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Thank you. Okay. Ah, well, looking at this, I noticed that you have something checked in just about every category. Hmm. 

00:46:00
LIAM CAMPBELL Yeah. I looked at it. It got me to thinking. But not everything is on your list doc. 

00:46:05
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  All right. Liam, it wouldn't be too much to list. So if there is anything that will apply to you that wasn't on the list, I, I hope you wrote it in. Hmm.- 

00:46:15
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY - What I'd like to do know is to go through each category and I like you to give me some examples of when these happened. Let's start of with the physical. 

00:46:20
LIAM CAMPBELL  Okay. Well the hangar I work in, pretty noisy all the time, very cold because they keep the air-condition going full blast night and day. And then sometimes I have to get up on these ladders to reach engines on these ladders are, was hydraulic once like firefighters use. That's not so bad but sometimes they're jerky. (crosstalk) 

00:46:45
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Hmm. 

00:46:45
LIAM CAMPBELL  And then I have to bend backwards a lot to look up for a long time. When I'm in the nose (inaudible ), yeah, sometime I had to contort myself to come get a good look at everything I need to look at. 

00:47:00
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. Liam, which one of these do you have control over? 

00:47:05
LIAM CAMPBELL The physical stuff is not much. I can do about that but I usually wear some sound proof head gear and in the hangars that keeps the noise, they're constant and hangars are cold, but I keep my office nice and comfortable, and its quiet. I've got a fridge, coffee machine and a little stereo system set up that plays my music for me. 

00:47:30
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  What kind of music? 

00:47:35
LIAM CAMPBELL Old country and western mostly, but I like Scottish and Irish music, 'coz that's how I grew up. So I know some of that. 

00:47:40
Affirmative effective strategies 

00:47:40
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Well, sounds like you already have some good ways to de-stress yourself after working in your cold and noisy hangars but I also hear you saying you, you don't this comfortable on the high ladders, and all that contorting you have to do to see everything. That that's starting to get to you. And I also see that you've checked aging on your list. 

00:48:00
LIAM CAMPBELL Yeah. That's beginning to bother me. I hate to say it but I'm not as young as I used to be, and I think I'm starting to feel it. 

00:48:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. Let's go to the next one. But I wanna circle aging for us. Because remember, we talked about premature aging and how it can be related to the, to chronic stress. So let's keep that in mind as we go through the rest of this. Okay, let me circle aging right here. Social stressors. I noticed you have disagreements and difficulty with your colleagues or supervisors and employees. Can you tell me what's going on there? 

00:48:35
LIAM CAMPBELL Well, we're to even start. You know, it's getting harder and harder to find and keep good mechanics. I told them when I hired them they'd be randomly drug tested every week so they know exactly what they're getting into each week. I did it. I had to let someone go last month, and she was really good. She knew her stuff but I guess she wanted something else more than she wanted this job. By the time I go to my bosses and tell them we need to do something about this, maybe some counseling in them, for them or something. But the big boss has just turned a blond eye and say, "Go hire somebody else." Don't they realize I can't meet my deadlines as I don't have a large enough crew. 

00:49:25
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY So Liam, what I'm hearing is that you're finding it more difficult to find and keep not only good mechanics, but good mechanics that are drug-free? And if you don't have enough of them, you don't have enough people to work. So it's hard to meet deadlines. 

00:49:35
LIAM CAMPBELL  That sounds about right, Doc. 

00:49:40
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. We'll probably talk more about this when we get to work stressors. So let's go on, you've got births and retirement checked, is retirement type of aging? 

00:49:50
LIAM CAMPBELL Yeah. I started thinking about it. And what I wanted to do, my wife and I wanna do some traveling. Go Ireland, and see where my ancestors are from and spend some time there. Her people are from Scotland so we wanna go there too. We know we're getting older so we wanna start doing some things before we're too old to enjoy them. 

00:50:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. Births? 

00:50:15
LIAM CAMPBELL I got another grandbaby and we went down to see her. And my daughter, they're doing pretty good now. There was difficult pregnancy because she is older and the doc wasn't sure if she could carry the term. Well she did. She still need a little extra help and rest. I'm worried about her because she lives in another state. 

00:50:35
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Hmm. Okay. That's something more first to keep in mind then. Uhm. What about the negative thoughts you checked. You've got high expectations of self and "if it's not perfect, it's not worth doing? 

00:50:45
LIAM CAMPBELL  Well, if me and my crew make a mistake, that plane is coming down or it won't go up. Either way I to, I hold myself and my crew to very high standards because its peoples lives at stake, and I don't want some catastrophic to happen on my watch. Maybe I'm a little perfectionist, but in this job you have to be. 

00:51:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  I hear you. Actually, the way you put this, it does put a different twist on things because for you, you really have to be concerned about people's lives here. And I'm sensing that we're gonna have to spend a little bit more time talking about this. And that leads us back to the work-related stressors that you checked of. Can you tell me more about the "how things are at work"? 

00:51:35
LIAM CAMPBELL Well, as like I said before, it's getting harder to find and hire drug-free mechanics, and my bosses don't seem to care. And then to top it off, now the big bosses are starting to talk about laying some of my crew off. If they do that, there's no way I can meet my deadlines, especially if I have to fire somebody too. My crew is coming to me all scared, but I don't do anything. I can't do anything. Don't get me wrong, doc. I love what I do. I love airplanes and being around them all day. But I'm starting to wonder how much longer I wanna do this. 

00:52:15
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. That does sound like a good question for us to talk about.- 

00:52:15
Summarize & assess accuracy 

00:52:15
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY - I mean, what I'm hearing out of this is ah, four things; uhm, getting and keeping good drug-free employees is getting more difficult, and your supervisors, they don't wanna do anything to help people change things. Uhm, your crew, they're becoming aware of the possible downs, downsizing, so understandably they're very anxious, and they're coming to you, with your, with their concerns and you're taking them on. But you told me this before, you're powerless. You can't do anything about the lay offs. And something you mentioned earlier that you're starting to think about retirement because you say your body and your energy level, they're changing. And there's some other important things like travel that you wanna with your life. And one more thing, even through all the stress that you're going through, you still love your job. You still love being around airplanes. Does that sound about right? 

00:53:05
LIAM CAMPBELL Yup, that sound about right. 

00:53:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. So I think we have a good idea of what's precipitating the stress. So now, let's talk about how all of these is affecting you? 

00:53:15
Review "symptoms" handout 

00:53:15
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Hmm. Let's, Okay. It looks like you've got some things in list of the categories here too. Hmm 

00:53:25
LIAM CAMPBELL  Yup. I thought it was just my body but it seems like I got lots of symptoms. I may not feel so tired lately, I'm tired a lot. I've been having trouble sleeping, headaches. I never used to have headaches. Then I've been eating a little more than I used to. Now the other doctors get me on medicine for my high blood pressure. And then my mind seems to wonder too. It's kind of hard to concentrate on what I'm doing. I found myself thinking about it. Will I ever get to do something that I wanna, like visit Ireland, go back to Australia, Fiji. Lately, people have been telling me, I've got a sense of humor. I've got no sense of humor. I always thought of myself it's a lot harder to tell a good joke and laugh at one 'til lately. Not much is funny. Everything is serious. And speaking of serious, you know that's why my wife started calling me Mr. Serious. And sometimes I get sort of in a hurry. For no reason, you know, we used to go out dancing every week and sing a while since we've been out dancing. I wanna get back to my old self. I miss going out with her and seeing friends and dancing. She's a real good dancer doc. I don't know why I get irritable. And the time and short with her and my crew, so what are we gonna do, doc? 

00:55:00
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Yes, Liam. What are we going to do? I have a question for you.- 

00:55:00
Encourage self-efficacy 

00:55:00
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  -Looking at the categories where your symptoms are, which one do you think is the most important to address first? And by that I mean, which one do you think, if you could get a handle on it would start making you be your old self again? 

00:55:15
LIAM CAMPBELL  You know, doc, I was thinking, remember the last time I had any fun and enjoyed myself. I think probably, if I did something enjoyable, I might feel better. What do you have on this sheet again? Physical, cognitive, emotional, behavior? That behavior on sounds about right. I guess if I did something different, I'd feel better and less stressed. So I'm thinking behavioral. 

00:55:55
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Well, that sounds about right for you. I mean it really, what we're talking about its self care, valuing yourself. It like on a plane, when the flight attendant tells you, if the cabin depressurizes you put on your oxygen mask first. Why do you think they tell you to do that? 

00:56:05
LIAM CAMPBELL  Well, so you can then assist others, of course. If you're dead, you can't help anybody. Well, I think I've seen where you're going over this. I guess we're saying I need to take sometime out for me, to do things I enjoy, I guess. 

00:56:25
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Yeah, you're right. Unless you take care of yourself, you're no good to anybody else, like your family, your friends, your community. And I mean, all that volunteer work you do with the kids from the local schools. You're doing something that gives you joy. I mean, you can put it ah, more jingle in your spore in. Figuratively, of course. 

00:56:40
LIAM CAMPBELL Yeah, doc. I'd certainly like that. 

00:56:45
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay, Liam. I think I have a better idea of your situation now, and some ideas on which strategies might work best for you. But I do agree, it would be a good idea for you to start by doing something you find enjoyable. Now, what would that be? Think for a moment.- 

00:56:55
Encourage behavioral change 

00:56:55
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  -Can you tell me three things that you enjoy doing? That you like to do? 

00:57:00
LIAM CAMPBELL  Well, dancing with my wife, playing golf, playing with my grandkids. 

00:57:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Well you came up with those pretty fast. 

00:57:10
LIAM MATTHEW CAMPBELL Yeah, these are things I've been thinking about the past couple of weeks. I know I wanna do them. And now I think it's time to start doing them. 

00:57:20
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay.- 

00:57:20
Assign homework 

00:57:20
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY - Then this is your outside activity for next week. I want you to make a commitment that you will do one of these over the next week. Just choose one, don't tell me what it is. Surprise me and tell me next week. If you wanna do more, that's great. But you have to do at least one.- 

00:57:35
Assess commitment 

00:57:35
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY - Do I have a commitment from you? And commitment means on a scale from zero to 10, with zero being, "no way am I gonna do this," and 10 being, "Yes, ma'am. I'm doing it." Which commitment, what kind of commitment level will you give yourself? 

00:57:45
LIAM CAMPBELL  I'm a 10++ (laughs). 

00:57:50
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY 10++, I like that. Well so, what I wanna do now Liam, is to start talking about some of the ideas I have to address both to your sources and your symptoms. And here's what I'm thinking. In this section, I will work with Liam Campbell to identify his sources and symptoms of stress by having him complete handouts on his sources and symptoms based on different categories, asking him to identify any current effective coping strategies he already uses at work, asking him to identify three activities that bring joy to his life. Assigning him an outside activity of choosing one of those activities and making a commitment to do it sometime during the next week. 

00:58:35
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Stop an role-play helping clients identify their unique source and symptoms of stress. Use the handouts provided for suggestions and questions to use during the role-play. 

00:58:45
CECI HSU My name is Ceci Hsu. I'm 32 years old and I've been as certified fine art appraiser and art consultant for about 8 years. People usually call me when they wanna buy art for investment or to add to or sell their collection. Sometimes, clients can be difficult and a little temperamental. I recently married but kept my maiden name for professional reasons. My husband, Ansel(ph) teachers arts at the local university. I finally found a relationship that works with Ansel(ph). He's very supportive and funny too. It's a much better relationship than the last one. But even though my husband is very supportive, I started to have panic attack again with lots of physical symptoms. My doctor prescribe something for the panic attack, but I'm taking a lot more of it than I want to. Also, about six months ago, my grandmother was diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer's, and I really worried about her. On the positive side, my business has picked up over the last year, with a lot of referrals and I almost have more clients than I can handle. I'm starting to feel a little overwhelmed though, and I think that's why the panic attacks are coming back. Plus, next month, I have to attend the International Society of Appraisers Conference; I'm one of the keynote speakers, and then I have to give a workshop too. This is so not me. I don't like being a star attraction, but I know I have to do it, and I will get through it. 

01:00:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY In this section, I'll be working with the client Ceci Hsu. She's an art appraiser and another one of my clients referred her. One thing about Ceci is that, in addition to stress, she also has a history of panic attacks. So the treatment plan we came up with includes working on both concerns, sometimes simultaneously. One of the struggles has been to disentangle what was stress related and what was panic attack-related because so many of her symptoms overlapped, for both concerns. There were physical and cognitive symptoms. Also, she has a tendency to misinterpret physical symptoms related to stress. And that's been sometimes precipitating the panic attacks. What will focus on today are some techniques that work for clients who have both panic attacks and a variety of stress symptoms. Based on Ceci identifying her own unique sources and symptoms of stress in her last few sessions, we've agreed to initially focus on addressing those physical and cognitive symptoms. That means we will practice diaphragmatic breathing, imagery, progressive muscle relaxation, and a cognitive restructuring technique. Now, all of these can help her with the panic attacks too. We'll also discuss social support and the importance of exercise. Now even though we go over these, what's key here is going to be her commitment to trying out each one of the strategies for us to find out which one works best. Now join me as I work with Ceci Hsu as she learns different stress-reduction strategies. 

01:01:40
Diaphragmatic Breathing Tenth Session 

01:01:40
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  Well Ceci, the next thing in our agenda today is to start talking about the different strategies that are gonna help you with some in your stress symptoms and also help you cope with the panic attacks.- 

01:01:55
Action stage 

01:01:55
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY - Now last week, we decided to focus on learning physical control to your breathing as well as a muscle relax, muscle relaxation technique.- 

01:02:05
Offer starting point choice 

01:02:05
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY - What's your preferences the way we start? 

01:02:05
CECI HSU Ah, Well Dr. B. I think we should start with the breathing. If it's suppose to relax me and might make it a little easier that I get through the rest of the things that we got to do. 

01:02:15
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. Sounds good. But before we get started on the breathing, I wanna remind you that since we've been working together, we talked mainly about the sympathetic nervous system. And just a little bit about the parasympathetic nervous system. Now, starting out with this particular type of breathing, we're starting to engage the- 

01:02:35
Review parasympathetic N.S. 

01:02:35
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY - parasympathetic nervous system because that's the part that we can control. So what we'll be doing is to basically what we'll gonna counter as the stress response. And what that means is that: Ah, well your heart rate will slow down, ah, your blood pressure, that will go down. Ah, your muscles will feel loose, there'll be less tension and then your body, like that. And this is the same information in the handout that I gave you a while back. 

01:02:55
CECI HSU  Yeah, I saw that ah, copy in the folder at home. 

01:03:00
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Well, good. Well, ah, let's get started. First, I, I just want you to get comfortable. Shake yourself out a little bit if you need to. (breathes)- 

01:03:10
Show diaphragmatic breathing 

01:03:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY - The type of breathing we're gonna be doing is called diaphragmatic breathing. It's how we breathe when we're asleep. It is smooth and even breathing. And we'll be using your thoracic diaphragm, and that's the large muscle that's right about here. 

01:03:25
CECI HSU You mean right here. 

01:03:30
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Yeah, right about there. Uhm, let's say, uhm, think about a dinner plate. Okay, you take the dinner plate. You flip it upside down, that is your thoracic diaphragm. What its doing basically, it is separating your chest area from your stomach area. And diaphragmatic breathing, it's breathing more fully and it's very different from what's called a military or chest breathing. Chest breathing. Shallow. It's rapid. And sometimes when we're anxious, we, we actually hold our breath. And remember we talked about how the shallow breathing can sometimes precipitate a panic attack. 

01:04:00
CECI HSU  Yeah, I remember. 

01:04:05
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY (laughs) Okay. Good. Now, one way to know that your breathing diaphragmatically is to place your hands. I'm gonna, take a look at me right now. I'm gonna take my hands in to release my fingers just like this, and I'm gonna place them on my abdomen. Okay. (crosstalk) 

01:04:20
CECI HSU (inaudible ) 

01:04:23
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY And simply notice what happens when I breath in and out. Like this. 

01:04:25
CECI HSU  I noticed your fingers moved apart. 

01:04:30
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Right. Good. Yeah, they did. Yeah. Let's practice this a little bit to get it for a few seconds here. Okay. And what's happening is as you're breathing, you start to breath deeper. You're fully inflating your lungs and that's gonna flatten out your diaphragm, and that's what's making this area moves right now. You're breathing more fully. That, that's the diaphragmatic breathing. Now, I want you to practice breathing in and out to a count of four. Notice what happens to your abdomen and how you feel. Okay. Breathing in; one, two, three, four. And out; four, three, two, one. And do that a few more times on your own. And you can close your eyes or you can keep them open. It's your choice. 

01:05:20
[sil.] 

01:05:20
CECI HSU  Ah, I'm starting to feel a little lightheaded. It feels different from how I usually breathe. At least, I think it did. 

01:05:30
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. Don't use the numbers then. Just make sure that each breath, in and out, is even and deep. And make sure you aren't struggling to get a breath. Also, simply notice is that your chest is moving more or is it your stomach that's moving more. And also, sometimes when you're doing this, you might notice a negative or some judgmental thoughts coming up. If they do, try not to engage them. Simply be a witness to them. See them like, like credits, passing by on a screen, going away. Also, the feeling "different" you mentioned, it might mean that you've been breathing with your chest most of the time. And when we do that, we're not breathing deeply. So you might have been trying to breathe faster to trying to get in enough air. And remember, that along with some nonconstructive thinking, like maybe some fears or some, or maybe misinterpreting a feeling in your body, that is what can precipitate the panic attack. 

01:06:25
CECI HSU  Yeah, I remember they started when I was dating Ray(ph). Also you think those could be related? My breathing and the panic attack? 

01:06:35
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Yeah, they could. But we also need to look at some other things such as. 

01:06:40
CECI HSU Ah, no, wait don't tell me again. I know what you're gonna say. (crosstalk) 

01:06:45
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Okay, okay. (laughs) 

01:06:45
CECI HSU Uhm, I have to consider my thinking, what else is going on my life, might denote physical health and probably some other stuffs too. 

01:06:55
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Yeah, you're right. You do need to consider several things. Ah, I do wanna mention why this type of breathing is important. 

01:07:00
Role of nitric oxide 

01:07:00
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY There is a chemical, it's a gas, and it's located in our lower lungs and in our nasal passages and it's called nitric oxide. 

01:07:10
CECI HSU Nitrous oxide? That's the stuff the dentist uses? 

01:07:10
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY  Yeah, they do sound alike. But it's nitric oxide. It's an anti-inflammatory. So it's gonna relax the blood vessels in your lungs so that more blood and more oxygen can get into them. 

01:07:25
Inhale through nose 

01:07:25
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY And when we start to breath more deeply and through our noses, what we're doing is actually activating the beneficial effects of the nitric oxide. 

01:07:30
CECI HSU  Okay. I hear you. I think I'm starting to feel nice and relaxed. And I don't wanna loose the moment. Can you give me a few minute? 

01:07:40
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Enjoy. 

01:07:40
Diaphragmatic Breathing with Calming Words and Phrases Query strategy/effectiveness 

01:07:40
CECI HSU  Three(ph). 

01:07:50
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY How are you feeling? 

01:07:55
CECI HSU Good, I think. Quiet, I think that's a good word. Quiet. I like this. Ah, I should be able to feel like this all the time. 

01:08:05
DR. EDNA BRINKLEY Good. Now, I'd like for us to add something on to the breathing. For some people, a special word or an image, it can be very meaningful. And I remember you told me that you are already saying something to yourself before you see a client. Now, what was that again? 

01:08:20
Query strategy/effectiveness 

01:08:20
CECI HSU I say peace and calm...(crosstalk) 

01:08:20
EDNA BRINKLEY Ah, that's it. That's it. 

01:08:25
CECI HSU ...and then I take a deep breath. 

01:08:25
EDNA BRINKLEY Okay, okay. So you are already doing this. And, and that's really good. Has it been helpful to you? 

01:08:30
CECI HSU Well, I'm not sure. Ah, okay, but then, well I wish it work better. 

01:08:35
EDNA BRINKLEY  Maybe we could twick it just a little bit. Okay? Here's a suggestion. Hmm. Ah, do the diaphragmatic breathing, as you normally would, but then try saying the words when you inhale and exhale. And what I mean is that you could inhale with peace and exhale with calm. And practice that as often as you can remember to do it. Like in the elevator, at the stop light, before you see a client. Ah, also, ah, if you notice any negative thoughts puffing up, try not to engage them, try to refocus on your breathing. 

01:09:10
EDNA BRINKLEY  Ah, would you like to spend some time right now, practicing that just to get a feel forward and- 

01:09:15
Eyes open it trauma history 

01:09:15
EDNA BRINKLEY  -you feel you eyes open or closed, it's your choice? 

01:09:20
CECI HSU Yes, I like to practice that a little. 

01:09:25
EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. 

01:09:30
[sil.] 

01:09:30
CECI HSU  It feels different when I did it the this way. Ah, you know, I've got a potential client later this afternoon, she has many collections she wanna appraise and I would love to do it. Uhm, I'm gonna try this before I see her. 

01:09:50
EDNA BRINKLEY Sounds good. Ah, good luck. 

01:09:55
CECI HSU By the way, how long should I practice this? 

01:09:55
EDNA BRINKLEY Start out with what feels comfortable.- 

01:09:55
Encourage agency 

01:09:55
EDNA BRINKLEY  -You decide. Ah, then make it just a little bit longer. Ah, I also want you to note how you feel and any type of thoughts that might have occurred and bring that next week. 

01:10:05
CECI HSU  Well, good. 

01:10:10
EDNA BRINKLEY  Ceci, I wanna share something with you, that's something else that you can try, and it's called "Progressive Muscle Relaxation." And basically, it is tensioning your muscles like this. Like tensioning my hands like this, holding the tension for a few seconds, and then releasing the tension just like that. 

01:10:30
CECI HSU  Okay. You mean like this. 

01:10:35
EDNA BRINKLEY Yeah. Exactly. Okay. What we're gonna be doing is we're gonna start at the top of our head, of your head really. And work ourselves down to your feet or you could do in a reverse. And after we're finished, I'll ask you to give a body scan and see if there is any areas of tension left. And if there are, we're gonna go back and redo it. 

01:10:55
CECI HSU  So you want me to start with my face? You mean tight up my face. That's gonna make me look weird. Could I do this at home? I think I might feel a little embarrassed making faces and tightening up body parts in front of somebody. I promise I'll try it at home though. 

01:11:15
EDNA BRINKLEY That's fine. Ah, by the way, I have a handout for you on this. I was gonna give it to you after we finish practicing it, but I'll give it to you right now. 

01:11:20
CECI HSU Okay. 

01:11:20
Normalize and support 

01:11:20
EDNA BRINKLEY  And by the way, a lot of people feel really uncomfortable doing this and they prefer to do it privately. So whatever you need to do is fine. It's fine with me. All I ask is that you give yourself plenty of time and do it over. Practice it over in the next week and then let me know how it goes. 

01:11:40
CECI HSU I can do that. 

01:11:40
EDNA BRINKLEY Good. 

01:11:40
Cognitive Restructuring 

01:11:40
EDNA BRINKLEY  Ceci, remember earlier when you mentioned we also needed to look at your thinking process, about events and people in your life. 

01:11:55
CECI HSU Yes. Ah, you mentioned that when we first started meeting. And again, last week. I think you said we should look at how my words, my thoughts, my perceptions, situations can influence how I feel, and then what I do. 

01:12:10
EDNA BRINKLEY Right. And from last week, we talked about continuing to self-monitor your triggers for the panic attacks. Because we've identified that there were physical sensations and some thoughts too that were going on. And today, I wanna add something to that about thoughts and about a choice of words.- 

01:12:25
Review cognitive triad 

01:12:25
EDNA BRINKLEY  -We've talked about how our choice of words could influence how we feel. And that in turn can influence what we eventually do. And our choice of words can make us feel good or not so good. And one way most of us feel good is when we think we have possibilities, choices in our lives. 

01:12:45
CECI HSU Yeah. I felt good when I have choices. I really hate feeling boxed in. 

01:12:50
EDNA BRINKLEY Hmm. Since you say you hate feeling boxed in, I got a question for you. What do you think about the possibility that sometimes the word we say to ourselves can decrease the choices we see for ourselves? 

01:13:05
CECI HSU  I'm not sure I ah, I follow what you mean. 

01:13:10
EDNA BRINKLEY Well okay. Uhm, for example, I've- 

01:13:15
Note use of "absolutes" 

01:13:15
EDNA BRINKLEY - noticed several times today that you've used the word it should to describe things. Did you notice that? 

01:13:20
CECI HSU  Ah, well, no. 

01:13:25
EDNA BRINKLEY That's okay for right now. But I do have another question for you that's related to our choice of words and using the word should. What do you think of the possibility that some of your thoughts may not be as truthful as your mind tells you? 

01:13:40
CECI HSU You mean what I think real may not be really be real? 

01:13:45
EDNA BRINKLEY Well, yes and no. No because ah, sometimes what we think is happening, it really is happening. Like when you are worried about your grandmother's forgetfulness. And you and your mom, you took her to be evaluated and you found out that she was an early stage Alzheimer's, you- 

01:14:00
Mention prior accuracies 

01:14:00
EDNA BRINKLEY - checked it out and it was true. But for other times, Your thinking might not be as accurate. And we've talked about how the body doesn't know the difference between something real and something imagined, but it will have a reaction nonetheless. Like ah, when we do that scale activity several weeks back. So because we talked to ourselves a lot, and if what we mostly say to ourselves is negative or in absolutes like ah, using the word always, or never, or I should, or I have to. Well pretty soon, those messages, they can become automatic and we may begin to believe them and think they aren't true for our lives. 

01:14:40
CECI HSU So you mean that's like, I used to think I was having a heart attack when I felt that pain in my chest. But then you had me checked with the doctor and she told me the pain, actually it wasn't a pain, it was, this is embarrassing with chronic indigestion. And that my heart was fine, it wasn't even involved at all. 

01:15:00
EDNA BRINKLEY Right. Exactly. So we break that cycle. We started looking at and we started monitoring your words and thoughts. Ah, and today, I wanna add a little bit more to that. And I also have a handout about that, by the way. This is the handout. Ah, for example, you're looking at the handout right there, if we say words like should or always or never, those words, that's what's called absolutes. They are either or with no gray area. Yet ah, is life really full of absolutes, no middle ground, no possibilities? 

01:15:35
CECI HSU  I haven't thought about that before. I guess not. 

01:15:40
EDNA BRINKLEY I mean, basically what you're trying to do is you're trying to create possibilities with your word. You're giving up the have to, the should's, and one thing you may notice is that when you change the words, your emotions may change and things may seems ah, a little easier. And by the way, that's also related to your panic attacks. Ah, now, usually our thinking is so automatic. We don't monitor our thoughts. And we end up feeling, well, not so good. But if we take a few extra seconds. begin to notice our words and our thoughts, and start creating openings or possibilities instead of absolutes and closures, we may begin to notice, we feel differently. And this is like when we talked earlier about using words that were meaningful to you to help you relax, you gave yourself an opening, a possibility. 

01:16:30
CECI HSU  So are you saying that I should ah, or I could change some of the words and thoughts, and that may change the way I feel. 

01:16:45
EDNA BRINKLEY It's something I want you to consider and try out over the next week, see if you can catch yourself when you either say or think the absolutes, on the handout right there. And try substituting in the possibilities, those words, right there on the other side. Notice, if you feel different or if your outlook is different. 

01:17:05
CECI HSU I can do that. 

01:17:05
EDNA BRINKLEY Good. 

01:17:05
Social Support 

01:17:05
EDNA BRINKLEY Ceci, you've mentioned several times how supportive Ansel(ph) has been. You said, sometimes just knowing he's in the next room gives you a sense of comfort. And we've been talking about making sure you have supportive people in our life, as one of the ways to keep you going. 

01:17:30
[sil.] 

01:17:30
CECI HSU  Yeah. Ansel's(ph) great, and I've got, I'd say about five really close friends that I know. No matter what, they've been there for me. And one of them was in England now, so just knowing I have them keeps me going. 

01:17:45
EDNA BRINKLEY You're so right. Simply- 

01:17:50
Importance of social support 

01:17:50
EDNA BRINKLEY - knowing we have close friendships and supportive people in our lives. Even if they're not physically present, simply knowing we have them, that, that's what can keep us healthy in a lot of different ways and, the main one being that you'll be better able to cope with the stresses of your life than if you were trying to go with it alone. 

01:18:05
CECI HSU You're right. I cannot do this alone. I need my friend. Hey! I remember reading something about that in one of my magazines, uhm, what did it say? Uhm, I remember now, that article called it " social support" and said it was supposed to help decrease how I responded to, to stress in general. Also, something about having a lot of support can help me live longer. I'm less likely to get depression but it reduces my chance of having a heart attack and that I'm less likely to get sick, even though I'm stressed out. 

01:18:45
EDNA BRINKLEY Right. Well, that sounds like a really good article. That's good information. 

01:18:45
CECI HSU  Yeah, I think that's part of why my previous two relationships didn't work. Both of them just weren't there for me when I needed them. And I moved to be with the one, uhm, with one of them. And when I moved. I gave up my friends, my social support for him, and this time I stay put. I've made a lot of good friends here and I either see them or talked to them pretty regularly. And Ansel's(ph) very nurturing. He is not like a lot of men. He listens to me, he makes me laugh, he ask me about my day, I can share my fears with him and he doesn't judge me. 

01:19:25
Challenge "absolutes" 

01:19:25
CECI HSU  Uhm, like Ray(ph) and Lee(ph) did all the time. 

01:19:30
EDNA BRINKLEY All the time Ceci? 

01:19:30
CECI HSU  Huh. Oh! Yeah. Well, most of the time. 

01:19:35
Exercise 

01:19:35
CECI HSU  By the way, I forgot to tell you, after the heart thing with my doctor, I went ahead and signed up for (inaudible ) at the community center near my home. I even started jogging on their upside road(ph) track. 

01:19:55
EDNA BRINKLEY Good. (crosstalk) 

01:19:55
CECI HSU I'm definitely feeling better. I don't feel as tensed and I can take stressors a lot better nowadays. They've also got personal trainors after you, so I'm thinking about going to key sessions with one of them to get a good program going. 

01:20:10
EDNA BRINKLEY Well glad to here you followed up on that. It sounds like you surely will get some physical benefits of exercise and some psychological ones too. 

01:20:20
CECI HSU Right now, I'm looking more for the psychological benefits that helped with my mood. And while stress, panic attacks and anxiety. I'm glad we put exercise as part of the treatment plan. And at first I was skeptical, but now, since I've started doing it, it's like how was I surviving without this. I've also started to read more on the benefits lots of exercise. You know, how it helps me physically and psychologically. 

01:20:45
EDNA BRINKLEY  You're right that the exercise is going to help you with your mood. You've heard of endorphins, right? 

01:20:50
CECI HSU  Yeah, I heard of them, they are those natural opiates in my body and they kick in when I exercise and make me feel really good. (crosstalk) 

01:21:00
EDNA BRINKLEY That's them. 

01:21:00
CECI HSU It's like that runner high, I get when I'm out driving. 

01:21:05
EDNA BRINKLEY Yeah, and ah, your remember cortisol too, right? 

01:21:10
CECI HSU Oh! Yeah. I remember that as well. 

01:21:10
EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. Good. Well exercise is gonna help us decrease that. So there's gonna be a lot less of that stress hormone running through your bodies. And exercise is really great for ah, decreasing depression and anxiety symptoms, and chronic pain too. I guess, I think I'd put exercise as maybe the top three stress relievers for all the benefits that it gives us; for stress relief and good health in general. I mean, think about what it does for us. And, Oh! By the way, I've got a handout of that for you. What do you see? I've got a list of, what do you see as one of these psychological and the physical benefits? 

01:21:45
Mental Physical benefits 

01:21:45
CECI HSU  Uhm, it helps regulate our blood sugar, lowers our blood pressure, strengthens our main functioning. So even if we're under a lot of stress, we're less likely to get sick. Uhm, increases mental alertness. I gain social support through working out. I'm starting to feel some of these benefits, both physical and psychological, so you don't have to convince me. Uhm, and you know, that conference I have to go to... (crosstalk) 

01:22:15
EDNA BRINKLEY Uh hmm. 

01:22:15
CECI HSU ...I even called the head to find out what kind of gym equipment the hotel have. Come to think of it, I feel like I have a lot more energy now. I feel a lot more alive and a lot less anxious about the trip to. 

01:22:30
EDNA BRINKLEY Good. 

01:22:30
CECI HSU A part of me says I'm gonna sail through this conference with no problem. So what do you think of that Dr. B. 

01:22:35
EDNA BRINKLEY Yeah. I think its great Ceci. You know, I've seen such a tremendous change in you since we started working together. And it also sounds like you found another stress strategy that works really well for you. So from now on each week, I'm gonna start asking for a progress report on how your more athletic lifestyle is going. Uhm, hmm. Ah, I'm sorry but it seems that we're running out of time for today, but we do have time for one more thing. 

01:23:05
Imagery with Diaphragmatic Breathing 

01:23:05
EDNA BRINKLEY  Well Ceci, to finish out our session today, I'd like to do something that will incorporate diaphragmatic breathing and some positive imagery. So we'll be using an image that's meaningful to you, and combining it with breathing. I remember from our first session, you told me that ah, when you're growing up in the northwest, that you love the beach and you love the water. So I wanna use that image for you. And by the way, I'm gonna give you scripts so we can make an audio copy for yourself and feel free to change it, make it fit you more. Ah, are you willing to try it? 

01:23:40
CECI HSU Yeah, sure. What do I do? 

01:23:45
EDNA BRINKLEY Okay. Well, I'd like for you to close your eyes or leave them open if you feel more comfortable. Take a deep breath and hold it for several seconds down deep in your belly, then let it go. Breath in ones through your nose and then breath out through your mouth. 

01:24:05
EDNA BRINKLEY  Now I want you to start breathing in and out through your nose to a mental count of four. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1. And do this a few more times. Notice how cool the air feels as you breath in and how warm it feels as you breath out. As you continue to relax more and more, I want you to imagine yourself on a warm sandy beach where the air is just the perfect temperature. You could see and hear the seagulls and looms in the distance, and smell the salty water as you continue to breath deeply. As you walk along the beach, you notice, you can feel that your feet sink lightly into the warm sand. As you turn and look towards the water, you notice the wave roll in one after another with the strong warship sound receding wave upon wave. You then begin to notice the setting sun painting the sky and water with reds and gold's. You feel safe and a sense of wholeness and completeness. And right now, as you hear the waves and view the sun, you have no fears, no anxieties, you need nothing else, being here is enough. The setting of the sun reminds you of the things happening for you today. The abilities you now have and all the strategies you're learning. You feel assuredness and a confidence in who you are becoming. You know that you can handle new situations with these. As you continue to look out over the water, you notice the sun is sinking deeper and you remember that a little later, you'll be joining some friends for dinner on the waterfront. There will be laughter, closeness and the support of people who care about you. And you know that when you need no people, you'll be able to choose those that are good for you and send the others away. You'll be able to have warmth and friendship in your life whenever you want them, and you carry that knowledge with you. The sound of the return of the waves reassures you that these things will always be there for you. Now the sun has set and the stars are out. The site of the moon near the horizon reminds you that your friends are waiting for you, so you know it's time to move on back into life and into joy. But before you leave, you take one last look at the moon, take a long deep breath, turn around, and walk towards the living sounds of your friends. I want you to take a few more moments and when you're ready, open you're eyes and come back to the room.

EDNA BRINKLEY  In this section, I worked with Ceci Hsu to learn about and practice different stress reduction strategies such as diaphragmatic breathing, using meaningful words and phrases to induce relaxation, using positive imagery and music to induce relaxation, progressive muscles relaxation, the importance of exercise and social support and reframing absolutes into possibilities. 

01:28:25
EDNA BRINKLEY  Stop and role play one or several of the stress reduction strategies. Use the handouts provided for suggestions and questions to use during the role play.
