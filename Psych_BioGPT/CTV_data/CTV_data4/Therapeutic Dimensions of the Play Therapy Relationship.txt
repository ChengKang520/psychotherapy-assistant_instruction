THERAPEUTIC DIMENSIONS OF THE PLAY THERAPY RELATIONSHIP 

00:00:00
Dr. Garry Landreth Distinguished Contributor to Play Therapy 

00:00:00
NARRATOR This hour long training session was a part of one of Dr. Landreth's two day workshops on making contact with children through play therapy. In this video, Dr. Landreth explores what he considers to be the essential dimensions in facilitating the play therapy relationship and topics such as the four healing messages, the necessary conditions for helping children grow and helping children discover their own resources. Dr. Garry Landreth is a regents professor and founder and director of the Center for Play Therapy at the University of North Texas, the largest play therapy training program in the world. Dr. Landreth is internationally recognized as one of the foremost spokesman for and developer of the child centered approach to play therapy. He has pioneered child center play therapy training in international settings such as China, Korea and South Africa and is a frequent conference speaker and workshop presenter throughout the United States. Dr. Landreth's over 100 publications and videos include his book, Play Therapy the Art of the Relationship, which is widely considered to be the authoritative source on Child Centered play therapy and has been published in Chinese, Korean and Russian. His video, Child Centered Play Therapy a Clinical Session demonstrates his approach to play therapy. 

00:01:25
GARRY LANDRETH And in this relationship with the child we focus on the person rather than the problem. 

00:01:35
The Play Therapy Relationship is focused on: PERSON....rather than....Problem 

00:01:40
GARRY LANDRETH Folks if we set out to solve the problem then the emphasis to the child is my problem is more important than I am. If that is our major concern, attempting to solve the child's problem, then we're doing what the rest of the world is doing and that is the message to the child, "You're not very important. You're problem is what is important." But we can never know enough about the child to know exactly what the problems are. We should always be attempting to discover what the causes of the problems are and in the relationship with the child it's much more important to me to focus on the person of the child rather than any problem this child may be referred for. That keeps, I think for me, the proper perspective about the relationship that I don't want to get so caught up in other people's concerns that I lose sight of this child but yet I do want to pay attention to their concerns. I do need to be concerned about what their concerned about but I also want to maintain an openness and to allow this child to take me and this relationship to where this child needs to be not where somebody else thinks this child needs to be and not where perhaps I think this child needs to be. I'm just not wise enough to know where a child should be in their life or what they should be working on. 

00:03:20
The Play Therapy Relationship is focused on: PRESENT....rather than....Past 

00:03:20
GARRY LANDRETH I would much rather focus on the present than the past. I cannot do anything about the past. I might wish that I could go back and change that awful happening in this child's life but I can't go back and correct that. I can help to soften the blow of what happened in the past. So I'd much rather focus on the present. I don't need to find out a lot of information about the past because I can't do anything about that. I can't change it, I can't reconstruct the past or restructure the past to make the past different. I can only deal with the present in this relationship with the child and in this relationship with the child I can help to soften the blow of what this child has experienced. 

00:04:15
The Play Therapy Relationship is focused on: FEELINGS....rather than....Thoughts or Acts 

00:04:15
Garry LandrethI would much rather focus on feelings rather than thoughts or acts. Children are emotional creatures. They don't deal well with the facts. The facts do not govern their behavior or change their behavior or change their life. A child's feelings will be projected and portrayed in the play and that's what I would like to know more about. This child's reactions, this child's feelings to that happening in their life. 

00:04:50
The Play Therapy Relationship is focused on: UNDERSTANDING ....rather than.... Explaining 

00:04:50
GARRY LANDRETH I would much rather focus on understanding rather than explaining. How many of you would agree that there are enough other people already trying to explain things to the child, I don't want to be one more on top of all the others trying to explain something to this child and my experience is that children are not greatly influenced and not greatly impressed by what I think about it anyway. I've never had a child say to me in all the experiences I've had in play therapy, I've never had a child say, "Oh Dr. Landreth, I'm so impressed with your insight." They simply could not care less about my insight. What impacts the child is this relationship, how I feel, how I portray myself to the child, what we do together in this relationship, what I'm like as a person. That is what they will carry away with them, not some profound insight I have about this artwork that they just created. 

00:06:00
The Play Therapy Relationship is focused on: ACCEPTING ....rather than.... Correcting 

00:06:00
GARRY LANDRETH I would much rather focus on accepting rather than correcting. There are already enough other people in this child's life correcting this child or attempting to correct this child's behavior. I would like to accept this child. Someone has said that acceptance is neither to condemn nor condone. I won't condemn you for that, I don't necessarily condone that behavior but I can accept you and I can accept that as being true for you, not necessarily true for me. If I set out to change this child, if my major focus, my major goal is to change this child, then how can I accept this child? If my objective or wish is that this child would do something differently or be differently, how can I be accepting of the child? I think if I am wanting this child to be different in some way, the child will sense that and they sense it as non acceptance of the person they are. Acceptance does not have an if, there is no qualifier in acceptance. Acceptance is now. If my thinking is I would like this child a lot better or I'd feel a lot better about what we're doing if this child would begin to change there's that big if, I'll accept you more if, and that's non acceptance. Can I accept this child the way this child is now? I don't believe children are free to change until they are safe enough not to change. Ponder that. Fact I believe that dimension is true of all people, not just children. That I can't change until you accept me the way I am and then I am free to change but if you're wishing that I were different you cause my defenses to stay up and then I'm not safe to change. 

00:08:30
The Play Therapy Relationship is focused on: CHILD'S DIRECTION....rather than....Therapist's Instruction 

00:08:30
GARRY LANDRETH I would much rather focus on the child's direction rather than my instruction. I believe this child knows where he or she needs to go and it's their direction that I trust and over the years I have come more and more folks, to trust that dimension in play therapy. That the child will take this relationship to where this child needs to be. 

00:09:05
The Play Therapy Relationship is focused on: CHILD'S WISDOM....rather than....Therapist's Knowledge 

00:09:05
GARRY LANDRETH I would much rather focus on the child's wisdom rather than my knowledge. I can interview a lot of people, I can read all the reports, I can do a lot of testing, I can gain a lot of knowledge and information about this child but none of that is as important as the wisdom this child possesses. Whatever a child becomes in the play therapy relationship with me, the child was already capable of that before they ever came to me. Ponder that, folks. That when a child is born into this world, barring some catastrophic developmental problem, disregarding those few isolated cases, when a child is born into this world, they possess at birth all they will ever need for normal growth and adjustment. I can't add anything to it. Whatever they become they were already capable of becoming. All I can help to do is to release what already exists within the child and I see that as my major focus and my major task is can I relate to this child in such a way that I will help to release what this child already possesses? I'm not like God, I can't create anything in this child. Let me shift gears a little bit now and continue our theme of looking through the child's eyes and what children see. There was this little boy, five years old, looked out his window one morning and promptly announced, "There's a great, big, huge lion out in our yard." Mother looked out the window real quick, big yellow cat but no lion and so she said to Warren, "Warren, you know we don't tell lies at our house." And there's a bridge club meeting here and all these ladies are watching this interaction so the mom is adding more than she normally would and so she added, "Warren, you go back to your room and you think about that and while you're back there you have a talk with the Lord about what you just did." Warren goes back to his room, almost immediately he's back. One of the ladies in the group said, "Well Warren, what did the Lord say about that?" and this grinning youngster said, "He said, "Don't worry Warren, when I first saw it I thought it was a lion too."" We need to be sensitive to how children see the world. Folks we just need to take a lesson from children's literature about what's important to children. There's a great lesson about what's important in the Wizard of Oz. You've all read the story or seen the movie and you remember in the movie there's the scene where the tin man is coming along and the straw man comes along and they meet at this juncture and they strike up a conversation and they discover in their conversation they're both going in search of the wizard of Oz and when they find him they're going to ask him for something special and do you remember what the tin man said he was going to ask the wizard for? He was going to ask for a heart and can you see in the movie the straw man's reaction to that, "Hahaha," he thought that was the funniest thing he'd ever heard of. "A heart, who wants a heart? I'm going to ask for brains," he said. "Now brains, that's what's important." and do you remember the tin man's response. He said, "Once upon a time I had brains and a heart and having tried them both I would much rather have a heart." Children are much more impacted by what's in our hearts than what's in our minds, folks and we need to keep that in mind in terms of building a relationship with the child. As we relate to the child there are four therapeutic messages that we should always be working hard to communicate to the child in our relationship with this child. These four healing messages make a difference in how the child perceives us and perceives themselves. 

00:13:55
4 FOUR HEALING MESSAGES 

00:13:55
I am here 

00:13:55
GARRY LANDRETH The first message is, I am here. I want to be fully here for this child. I would like to sense what this child senses, feel what this child feels, I would like to enter so fully into this child's world that I have no need to evaluate this child. You see if I'm working hard to understand this child, to be with this child, to sense what this child is feeling, thinking, wanting to do, if I'm working hard to be in that kind of relationship with this child, I have no time to evaluate this child in any way to think about whether that's good or bad or right or wrong, if I'm looking through the child's eyes, if I'm fully here for this child and I would like for the child to know that, that I am fully here for you. I'm not going to be thinking about something I need to do. I'm not gonna be thinking about something that happened just before this session started. I want to leave all of that outside. I'm not gonna be thinking about the fact that managed care hasn't paid for five months now or that there's a major report that I've got to finish as soon as I get out of this session. I want to leave all of that aside and be fully present for this child. I'm here. 

00:15:30
4 FOUR HEALING MESSAGES 

00:15:30
I am here 

00:15:30
I hear you 

00:15:30
GARRY LANDRETH The second healing message is I hear you. I'm here, I hear you. I would like to be so secure within myself that I can hear everything about this child. I would like to be so secure within myself that I can allow this child to be separate from me, that I have no need for this child to be like me. Nor do I have any need for this child to like me. That I'm secure enough within myself, that I can tolerate this child hating my guts right now, wishing he were with somebody else and I don't feel badly about that because I'm secure enough within myself. Folks, the play therapy relationship and the dimensions of play therapy begin with us. We must take care of ourselves first. There's a great example of that every time you get on an airplane and they go through the instructions about the oxygen mask and they always say if you have children with you, when the oxygen drops out of the ceiling, you put it on yourself first and then you put it on the child. You take care of yourself first so that you're then in a better position to do what the child needs and that's a good lesson for us. That we take care of ourselves, of our emotional needs, our needs to be in control or to be wanted or whatever our needs are, we meet those needs in other relationships so we can be fully present for the child, secure enough in ourselves to allow the child to be separate from us. 

00:17:35
4 FOUR HEALING MESSAGES 

00:17:35
I am here 

00:17:35
I hear you 

00:17:35
I understand 

00:17:35
GARRY LANDRETH The third healing message is I understand. I want this child to know that I understand this child. Can I understand the hollowness of failure? What it feels like to have just flunked out of kindergarten and now I'll never get into the college of my choice? Can I understand that? Can I understand the grief this child is experiencing? Can I understand the loneliness this child experiences everyday out on the playground when no one asks this child to participate in play? And if I can then communicate my understanding of that I think that will make a difference in this child's life. To know you're understood is therapeutic, its freeing, it's healing to know you're understood. That there is somebody who cares and I would like for the child to know I am a person who cares and I think that will make a difference in the child's life. I was just reminded of that dimension, several years ago there was an item on CNN TV news about an elderly lady who was hooked up to a life support system and she was in a coma and the decision was made to disconnect and in the process of disconnecting her from the life support system they called in a young intern to help and as he was taking one of the tubes out of her arm he just unconsciously began to stroke her arm and rub her hand just out of compassion for this lady and her eyes opened and he continued to rub her arm and stroke her and she said, "I didn't know anybody cared." I would like to be that kind of person in the child's life, a person who cares. I want this child to know there is somebody in this world who values you, who prizes you as a person, who would never do you harm and that has become a mission for me. I used to wonder, I spent some time struggling with, surely God has some intent or purpose for me in life to be on this earth that extends beyond eating some good food and breathing air. That surely God has a purpose for me and I have concluded for me that God's purpose for me is that I should work as hard as I can to help to make this world a safer place for children and then the next step for me was I began to realize the safest place for children in the world is in a play therapy relationship where there will be no harm, there are no negative words, there are no putdowns, there are no discouragements, only support and acceptance and encouragement and understanding and love and compassion and concern. An absolutely safe relationship and that's a part of the therapy for the child to experience that kind of relationship. 

00:22:00
4 FOUR HEALING MESSAGES 

00:22:00
I am here 

00:22:00
I hear you 

00:22:00
I understand 

00:22:00
I care 

00:22:00
GARRY LANDRETH Well, I think if I'm successful in communicating to the child I'm here, I hear you, I understand then I think the fourth healing message comes along automatically and that is the message I care. I think this kind of caring that I'm trying to communicate to you releases the dynamic potential that already exists in the child, that the child is capable of healing self. It's not something I do to the child. I don't create anything, I can only help to release what already exists in the child. I think folks, in terms of our relationships with children, we just need to take a lesson from the bean seed. How many of you have ever planted a bean seed? Oh my, this is an uneducated group. Folks, this is the southern belt of states here, everybody gardens. If you have never planted a bean seed, when you get home this afternoon, an assignment for you, when you get home this afternoon, you get a little cup, you put some soil in the bottom of the cup, you get a bean seed, stick down in the soil, pour a little water on top of that, set the cup in the window so the sun's rays will warm that spot and do you realize that's all you can do? You can't make the bean seed grow. You can only provide the conditions necessary. Well for those of you who have planted a bean seed and the rest of you will just have to listen in, the deprived group. For those of you who have planted a bean seed when you stand above ground, what is the first indication that the bean seed is growing? What do you see that lets you know the bean seed is growing? 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN The soil cracks. 

00:24:25
GARRY LANDRETH The soil cracks and in the crack appears a little greenish white crook. Now imagine what would happen if you stand above ground for three hours watching that little greenish white crook and you finally conclude, "Bean, you're not growing fast enough. Let me help you." And with great tenderness and proper intent, you kneel down and you very carefully begin to straighten up that little greenish white crook. What will happen every time? It will break. When will it straighten up? When it's ready. Lesson learned, let's go home. You cannot make children grow faster than they are developmentally read to grow in spite of what managed care says. We must wait for children to grow. It is a slow process, you cannot make it happen faster, you can only wait. Play therapy requires persistent patience, not just patience but persistent patience. We should be equally be patient with the child who bursts forth with things overnight like mushrooms out in the yard that just suddenly appear and some children are like that, they just burst forth with things and we must be persistently patient with the child who moves like they're walking through molasses, slowly doing everything. Growth is a slow process and children will grow if we provide the proper kinds of conditions for them. If we will listen to the lessons in the bean seed that will help us in our relationships with children and to be sensitive to the child's needs. What is in the child needs to be recognized and appreciated. There's a great lesson for us in the life of 14 month old Jessica McClure. Do you remember 14 month old Jessica McClure who fell down the well shaft in West Texas? Think about what that would be like, you're walking across your kitchen floor, you don't watch where you're going, you've done this thousands of times, you walk across your kitchen floor and suddenly it opens up and swallows you and you fall forever. You don't know what has happened, it happened too quickly, suddenly you're falling and when you stop falling you're wedged into this tight little place. You can't hear anything, you can't see anything. You would not know where you were, you would not know what happened and that happened to this 14 month old and do you remember what they heard form that 14 month old when they finally got a microphone down to her 42 hours later? They heard her singing instinctively, intuitively she knew what to do to comfort herself in the midst of that awful, awful circumstance. She was not singing because someone yelled down the well shaft, "Jessica sing to yourself, it will comfort you." That didn't happen, she knew to do that. Children have an inner wisdom, children possess an inner direction children will take us to where they need to be to heal themselves if we will provide the proper kind of relationship for them. We cannot make them change, we cannot make them grow we cannot control growth for people. If we were able to that would scare me to death. We must persistently be patient in our relationships with children and how we respond to children identifies for the children the uniqueness in us. The kinds of responses that we were working on yesterday afternoon, how to respond therapeutically to children, to let children know, we understand. That makes us a different person in the child's life. I had a doctoral student several years ago, who had a wonderful relationship with this eight year old child named Bobby. In my setting, we start working with the children in September and we're able to get in about 14 sessions, 15 sessions and we have a Christmas break and my center for play therapy confirms to the University calendar so we have a full month off for Christmas, from middle December to middle January. That is a terribly long time in a child's life. I love it, it's a great month off, but it's a long time in children's lives. Well during this month's time off, my doctoral student cut her hair, changed the color, not from black to blonde but she did change the color of her hair and changed her make-up accordingly and she did look some different and she'd had 14 sessions with Bobby and I happen to be out in the waiting room in January and she came out of her office after this Christmas break, greeted Bobby with, "Good morning Bobby, we can go to the play room now." And he looked up at her and said, "Do I know you?" and she said, "Oh Bobby, quit kidding around, you know who I am," and they went back to the play room. I'm back watching the session. About halfway through the session, Bobby's moping around about, "Got sent to the principal's office, I was down there for three hours," probably 30 minutes but it seemed like three hours to this child and he was talking about his morning there and what had happened and just really kind of discouraged and down about the whole happening and right in the middle of this interaction somewhere, the doctoral student responded to Bobby with, "Sometimes it just hurts deep inside when nobody seems to understand." And he jerked around and he looked at her and so, "Oh, now I know you're you." He could not be sure of who she was by the way she looked but when she touched him with that empathic response, in his heart he suddenly knew, it's her. He felt it, he felt it. I'd like to have that kind of relationship with children, that they would feel the caring. That will make a difference in children's lives. I prefer not to engage children in sword fights and that is a personal issue for me. I'm just, it bothers me tremendously that a child might think I would do them harm, even in play and that I would take up the sword against them. So for me, if the child wants to engage in a sword fight you can pretend the Bobo is me and fight the Bobo. I feel the same way about a child asking me to shoot them. I would never pretend to shoot a child, never. The child says, "I'm the bank robber. I just robbed the bank and you're the policeman and I come running out the door and you shoot me." I am not going to shoot that child, I'm not even going to pretend to shoot the child. If the child insists on that then I would again say that you can pretend the Bobo is me and have the Bobo do that, but I choose not to do that and if the child pushes the issue and wants to know why, I would share with the child because that bothers me to even think about doing you harm. I would not even want to, in play think about harming you. 

00:34:15
UNKNOWN What if they ask you [inaudible] 

00:34:17
GARRY LANDRETH If the child asks me to handcuff them, I will assist as I will in something else helping them get the handcuffs on but I would not tie them up, if they want to tie themselves up and they have trouble tying the knot I would help with the tying of the knot if they have trouble, or if they have trouble getting the handcuff on I would assist but I would not do it to the child. I'm just very sensitive to the fact that, I don't want to do anything that would harm this relationship. This is a very special relationship, I've worked hard to build this relationship. I feel kindly toward this child, I feel warmly toward this child. I don't want to do anything to change that part of my relationship with the child. I was just thinking of some other related issues there, a child, a child, lines up toy soldiers in two rows, one in front of him, one in front of you, hands you a dart gun, child takes a dart gun, child shoots one of your toy soldiers and then says, "Now it's your turn," would you shoot the child's toy soldier and before you answer that question think about what we know about child development and how children view their possessions. Children view their possessions as an extension of their person. You see we just fall back on what we know about children and child development and apply that to the play therapy relationship. We should not disregard what we know about children. That governs, should govern what we do with children in the play room. Children view the possessions as an extension of themselves. Now if I shoot this child's toy soldier that can be internalized by the child as an act against his person. I would not want to do that. I would not want to even, again, risk the possibility of tampering with this relationship that I've worked hard to build up with this child. If the child insists that I shoot the toy soldiers, I would hand him my gun and you can pretend you're me and shoot for me but I would never shoot a child's toy soldier. I would never pretend to shoot the child. A child, extending that scenario, a child may suddenly pretend you're the bad guy or you're the bank robber and he pretends to shoot you. Be careful that you not add to the child's drama. Don't anticipate that you know what should happen next. The child shoots you and you grab your chest and go, ugh, and fall on the floor. Maybe the child didn't intend for that to happen or what if this is a child that has been traumatized by such an experience in his own home, sitting in his living room one night and somebody bursts in the door and blew his father away and now the child comes into the play room and turns and shoots at you and you grab your chest and fall on the floor and the child suddenly is traumatized because he thinks he has done to you what he saw done to his father. Do you see the risk that you take by entering into the drama without knowing or without intending to do harm you can do harm to a child so I would be cautious about adding to the drama? Well I know just before the break for lunch there were a number of you who had questions, I would like to take some time to respond to several of those right now. Would you like to ask your question again? 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN Can you help them with toys or in situations like when they come to you and ask you how to do it or... 

00:38:50
GARRY LANDRETH OK the question is what do you do if a child wants help and I think the help with completing a task or taking a jar lid off. A lot depends on the child what the child is capable of so we have to consider the child's age and the child's developmental level as well as the child's needs as well as is this a manipulative child, is this an overly dependent child, all of those things we must take into consideration in deciding whether or not we will directly interact with the child and assist them. I think we always have to fall back on what is our objective with the child and one of our objectives is always to help this child to discover his or her strengths. If you do it for me, how will I ever discover my strengths? None of these situations in play therapy are real clear cut, simple kinds of situations. They may seem kind of simple but they are very complex issues. Rule of thumb, if you do for the child what the child can do for himself or herself you teach that child he or she is weak. There's not a one of us in this room that would ever write into our case notes, my objective is to teach this little girl just how weak she is but the tendency is, especially for little girls or dependant little boys, to do it for them if they ask for help or if they're struggling a little bit, we rush in and we offer help or we just do it for the child and if you do it for the child, then you've deprived the child of the opportunity to struggle, to complete it and to discover in the process, I'm capable. We're always concerned about empowering the child. We're already empowered, or should be. That's one of the things you should have accepted, discovered and accepted about yourself so we don't' need credit for doing more, the child does. Now to try to specifically answer your question, if one of you will volunteer to role play with me, I will demonstrate how I would respond to a manipulative child and how I'll respond to a child who truly needs help, is there somebody who'll, if you'll just step up here then. Marybeth if you will pretend that you are five years old and you're goal in life is to get Garry Landreth to open this can to find out what's inside there, there is something in there and you're not even gonna try. You're whole objective in life at this moment is to get me to open it. Looks like you're trying to get that lid off. 

00:42:30
MARYBETH Will you get it off for me? 

00:42:30
GARRY LANDRETH I know you'd like for me to open that but in here, if you want the lid off, you can get the lid off. 

00:42:35
MARYBETH But, I can't do it. 

00:42:40
GARY LANDRETH Just keep telling yourself you can't do it but if you want it off you can get it off. 

00:42:50
MARYBETH But I need you to do it. 

00:42:50
GARRY LANDRETH Oh so you need me to do that for you. 

00:42:55
MARYBETH Uh-huh, I can't do it. 

00:43:00
GARRY LANDRETH I know you just keep telling yourself you think you can't do it. Oh so if I won't open it for you you'll just throw the can down on the floor. I can, I can see you're pretty mad about that and I guess you're mad at me for not opening the can for you. 

00:43:20
MARYBETH Yeah, open it. 

00:43:20
GARRY LANDRETH I know, I know you want me to. 

00:43:25
MARYBETH Open it. Open it. 

00:43:25
GARRY LANDRETH I know you'd really like me to open that can and if I won't open the can you'll just cry. Thank you, Marybeth. Hold on a minute. Folks, do you get the idea that no matter what I'm not going to open this can? If you got that idea, you're accurate because you may not have been able to see it very clearly, she didn't even try. She didn't even try, how does she know she can't open this can? She didn't examine the can, she didn't see, "Oh let's see, this is what's coming up, hmm," she didn't even try. Her whole objective was to get me to open and there's a lot of children like that, to get you to do it and I could easily say, "Oh sure, let me," and what have I created? I've reinforced her dependency. People will do it for you. You either ask or plead or whine or cry and eventually you will get what you want. I don't want her learning that in this relationship with me. I would like for her to discover, "Oh, my old behaviors don't work in here." Now once you come to that point the child is then freed to go in another direction but she must first come to that point and then after that to discover this behavior didn't work I'm going to have to go searching for a new behavior and then to discover a strength in the process. Now let's look at the other side of this issue. Suppose you're three years old, you've got little bitty fingers, you discover there's something in here you want to see and you try to open it and you ask me for help. I can see you're trying to get that, boy that lid looks like that's hard to get off. 

00:45:20
MARYBETH I can't do it. 

00:45:20
GARRY LANDRETH It is hard. 

00:45:25
MARYBETH Will you do it? 

00:45:25
GARRY LANDRETH Well let's see, if you hold that right there and I can see you know, put your finger right there. 

00:45:30
MARYBETH Yeah right there. 

00:45:30
GARRY LANDRETH You know that's supposed to come up right there. If you put your finger right there, let's see what happens if you put your finger right there. Oh there you got it open. Thank you. 

00:45:40
MARYBETH Thank you. 

00:45:45
GARRY LANDRETH You make a great child. Now do you see the difference? We're always headed towards this end. Who gets credit? Who gets credit when the interaction is over, I should be able to make a self esteem building response. We build self esteem in little bitty increments, not in some giant something that we suddenly to, it's in little bitty ways, like giving credit. She asked for help, she gave it a good effort, she's trying, she asks for help, I'm going to readily interact with her and help but the end result is I was able to say to her what? 

00:46:25
UNKNOWN There, you did it. 

00:46:25
GARRY LANDRETH There you did it. We started to open the can, it cracked a little bit, I took my finger away, she opened it she gets credit then. There, you did it. That is the way we help children. We don't help children by, "Oh you want, here, let me open that for you, here." And we give it back. That does not help children, nor does it help the first child for me to open that can simply because she either cries or whines or pleads without trying. Were there some other questions I can respond to? Yes. 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN I had asked a question about interacting with the child through play. 

00:47:10
GARRY LANDRETH OK, yes basic, a basic question in play therapy that many play therapists struggle with is whether or not to participate in the child's play and again we need to go back and examine why we're in the play room, what our general objectives are with all children in the play room regardless of their presenting problem and what we're trying to accomplish there. If you enter the play room, introduce the child to the play room and you sit on the floor, what is the message to the child, now before you answer that let's go back again and examine, children who come to play therapy generally have poor self esteem. That's almost always true. A child with poor self esteem will read your behavior of sitting on the floor to mean what? They are supposed to invite you to play. There's only one neutral place in the play room. Where is it? 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN In the chair. 

00:48:30
GARRY LANDRETH The one neutral spot in the play room is the chair you usually sit in. The rest of this room is the child's territory so if you sit on the floor initially, I'm talking about the first session or two, if you sit on the floor that is to sit in the middle of the child's territory and many children who would never invite you to participate in their play will look at your seating yourself on the floor and read that as, I'm supposed to invite her to play and they will dutifully invite you to play, that's one caution. Now never, I'm not saying never sit on the floor. I'm talking about the first few sessions and how that message will be read by insecure children before the relationship is established. Another consideration is a child who maybe you're sitting in your chair, who invites you to play. The child is now in the lead and that follows the premise of let's keep the child in the lead to participate in the child's play at their request but I was hesitating there because I quickly thought of a number of cautions. Just because we want to keep the child in the lead doesn't mean we're gonna do anything this child asks us to do. The child says, "Here, you eat this sand." I am not going to eat a tablespoon full of sand or the child says, "Balance this cup of red tempura paint on top of your head and run around the room." I am not going to do that. Do you get the point that just because the child asks you to do it, doesn't mean we acquiesce simply because there's this premise of the child's supposed to be in the lead? There are still appropriate cautions. My experience is in supervising play therapist that many children, this is not a hard and fast rule, many children who've begin to feel the play therapist is not fully involved with them will invite the play therapist to play but that's not a guarantee that that is the message but I think that's one thing to consider. It is not a guarantee that just because you are directly interacting with the child in play that you are more involved with them. Just because you're participating in the play doesn't mean you're automatically now more involved with them, you may actually be less involved because you get caught up in your own participation. You can sit in a chair, work hard at projecting yourself into the child's play, lean forward, be consumed by what the child is doing, interact verbally with the child and the child feels your presence and they know you're a part of your play and so they don't feel the need to say come play with me because they already feel you're a part of the play. Now would I ever participate in children's play? Absolutely, a child says, "Come over here and sit on the side of the sandbox," or "Come watch me play in the sandbox." I'll get up and go sit on the corner of the sandbox or a child says," You be the daddy." and hands me the father doll, I'll hold the doll but I will only do within boundaries what the child prescribes. I do not assume that I know what the role should be. The child should prescribe the drama not me. A child says, "Go to the store and buy some eggs." And so you get up out of your chair and you head to the store, you're already in the lead folks. Number one, you don't know where the store is that the child has in mind. Number two you don't know how many eggs to purchase. I know how many you will buy. You will buy one dozen. Why? Because that's what you always buy. But you ask the child how many eggs should I buy and the child says, "100." You would have never thought of that. Because how many of you have ever bought 100 eggs? Probably no one in the whole room so we tend to project our own experiences into the play. Do you hear that point? So with caution, with caution we participate in the child's play but within boundaries, within boundaries. Did that answer that question? 

00:53:55
UNKNOWN Get a detail on that, and so the child says, "Go to the store and buy eggs." What is your reaction? 

00:54:05
GARRY LANDRETH What store? 

00:54:05
UNKNOWN Do you ask the details? How many? What store? 

00:54:10
GARRY LANDRETH Absolutely, that's the one time we would ask questions. When we're in this kind of interaction with the child and the child's giving directions. My experience is that if you will change from tell me what you want me to do to show me what you want me to do makes all the difference in the world. Child says, hands you a doll and says, "Tie this." Show me what you want done and in the process they do it. If you say to the child, "Tell me how you want it tied." Then the impression that's given to the child is wy don't you tell me then I will finish that up and do it for you but show me, the child does it.
