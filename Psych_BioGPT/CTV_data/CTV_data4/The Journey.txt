The journey, A review of intimate relations through role reversal Speaker: ZERKA MORENO 

00:00:45
ZERKA MORENO My name is Zerka Moreno. I do not intend to run a full psychodrama here in this setting or in an hour. One can run a session in an hour, but it's extremely intense and cut to the bone and fast. And we do sometimes have to do that with patients but I wouldn't, um, presume to do that in a group of this size in an hour. Uh, so I thought what I would do, would ask y-, I wanna lec-, lecture about psychodrama either. What I'm gonna tell you is that role reversal is, in our opinion, the sine qua non of psychodrama. It helps us to in the, um, self-presentation when the protagonist says, "Uh, my problem is with my mother, or my husband, or with my child, or whatever, my lover." In the old days we used to let the protagonist describe that other person so that the auxilliary ego could pick up the clues, the necessary clues, to portray the role. In fact, at one time, uh, in Beacon, Moreno would say, "Go behind the wings". There were wings infront of the, uh, in the back of the stage, and you would retreat as an auxilliary ego and get necessary clues. That's possible with people who are fairly well intact. That's obviously not so well possible with the psychotic patient. When you were then trained, Moreno would snap his finger when a role came up, and you came up and you did the darndest to, to represent the role to the best of your ability. For the protagonist, however, in order to feel that this is really their life, their space, their perceptions that are being affirmed, it's very helpful to say, "Why don't you become . . . take the role of, uh, your lover". And, um, I, I find it helpful to move them from one position to another. If they've been standing over here, say, "If you come over here". See if you can bodily get into the feeling. Uh, not only the feeing but onl-, also the body tone, the body language of the, of the, of the other person who's not here, the person you're going to represent, your lover. Try to use all the sense memory you have about this person, and I want stress sense memory. You know, (inaudible ) has these wonderful descriptions of sense memory. For instance, in childhood scenes, uh, smells are very important. Do you remember how strongly you responded to smells as a child? We're much closer to our animal origins when we're children, and much more sense of tastes, sounds, touches, all right? These are all important in psychodrama. Um, I wonder how many people did what I did when I was a child. I had a lot of bodily aches and pains and I used to translate them into tastes. There were sour pains and bitter pains and salty . . . did anybody else do that? Um, I'm sure other children must do that. They, in other words, use the whole sensorium to get a sense of what the sense they're experiencing in their body. Well, we forget that when we get older. So if you're treating someone in a dire situation and you want to use role playing, teaching your protagonist to role reverse with the absent other and become the absent other is extremely instructive. It, they may tell you the story about this other person while they talk about this other person, it's not until they take the role of this other person that that fleshes out and deepens and intensifies. The experience of the other, as well as the relationship. Now, remember we are relationship therapists. Moreno thought that he could not influence the psyche directly as well as through a relationship. I'm sure you've all had the situation where you've tried to do suggestion therapy or made a recommendation that patient carries out something after or between the sessions. They don't do it. Why? It isn't that they're resistant. It's simply that yours, it's your suggestion. Well, suggestion can or cannot work. There's resistance to suggestions that come from the outside. However, Moreno thought if you could work through the relationship then maybe you . . . suggestions could come through and come forth from the other role. And a very curious fact is that we often get more information about the protagonist from role reversal than we get from them in their own role. Have, how many people have discovered that in role reversal. Very startling. Real clues that you really need come forth all of the sudden. Well, theoretically this means, of course, that people are often stuck in their self system and more pro-, more spontaneous when you take them out. Do you remember the, what's, like, big cube with the nine dots? The mathematical problem of how do you line up all of these dots with four lines? You can't do it if you stay within the system. You can only do it by going outside the system, and I think that's a good image setup for people who want to realize that if you take, if you're blocked, if you're contained within this block, this square, and can't get out. Get outside. And the idea outside is in terms of role reversal. I have to have a, um, a volunteer for this. Someone who's will- . . . oh, please, not all at once. Well, why not (inaudible ) you? Um, maybe we can get more done. I don't know. We'll try, but it's, um, I was worried if I was going to get any volunteers today. I would like to do a family structure. Is that suitable for you? That's what was announced on the syllabus. Is that what you're aware of? 

00:06:45
LORI That's fine. 

00:06:45
ZERKA MORENO That's fine. 

00:06:45
LORI That's fine. 

00:06:45
ZERKA MORENO And we need a release from you. Is that all right, too? Because you know what . . . 

00:06:50
LORI Sure. 

00:06:50
ZERKA MORENO . . . I believe they're videotaping this darn thing, too. I have to tell you that I have a great horror of these electrical gadgets, these umb-, umbilical cords that connect us with a machinery. I also have some resentment, and it's probably totally personal, towards having you in the dark and me in the light, and the protagonist. You are just as much in the light. This is your drama. To it's, it's protagonist-centered, but, uh, you know, Harry Stuck Sullivan says we, we, uh, have our, we're all more human than otherwise. We're also more alike than otherwise. It's true the differences stick out and that's what we deal with, but we're often also more alike than we are different, the commonalities enormous. Wait, how many people have never been born in a family here? Or have produced themselves? Good. Now th-, that's not to say that our families are the same, but we have the, or as you begin to work over a period of years, you see certain structures recurring. There are patterns in families. Okay, let's find out about your patterns. What is your name? 

00:08:00
LORI Lori. 

00:08:00
ZERKA MORENO Lori. I tell you what our problem's gonna be, Lori. That you and I are going to get knitted in so many ways here with this cord. We'll do the best we can. 

00:08:05
LORI Okay. 

00:08:05
ZERKA MORENO And if we get very much enmeshed we won't have to individuate again. 

00:08:10
LORI Okay. 

00:08:10
ZERKA MORENO All right. How old are you, Lori? 

00:08:15
LORI I'm 25. 

00:08:15
ZERKA MORENO 25. Are you living with your family now, or where, where are you living? 

00:08:20
LORI I'm living with my husband. I'm away from my family of origin. 

00:08:25
ZERKA MORENO Do you want to bring your family of origin into the picture or do you want to stick with your husband? 

00:08:30
LORI Well, right now I feel that my difficulties more center around my husband and I. I, my parents are in Minnesota and I've, haven't dealt with some, those issues for awhile. So I would prefer to . . . 

00:08:40
ZERKA MORENO To what? 

00:08:40
LORI To focus on my husband and I. 

00:08:45
ZERKA MORENO Okay. Well, are there children? 

00:08:50
LORI No. 

00:08:50
ZERKA MORENO Are there children planned? 

00:08:50
LORI That's an issue. 

00:08:50
ZERKA MORENO Very good. Okay. In other words we have, first, we have a dyad here. The smallest unit of social interaction is a dyad up here, right? But remember that what we're dealing here is, uh, with our three entities. By the way, not entities in the, uh, you know, f-, uh, um, mediumistic sense or the psychic sense. Uh, units. Two people and the relationship, and we're as concerned about the people as we are about the relationship, but that's where we start right now. Okay. What's your husband's name? 

00:09:25
LORI Baron (ph). 

00:09:25
ZERKA MORENO How old is Baron? 

00:09:25
LORI He's 24. 

00:09:25
ZERKA MORENO 24. How long have you been married? 

00:09:30
LORI About, little over two years. Two and a half years. 

00:09:30
ZERKA MORENO Little over two and a half years. What do you do for a living? You are Ph.D. candidate. Are you working in psychology now . . . or just studying? 

00:09:40
LORI Uh, well I am working in that I see clients as part of my training. 

00:09:45
ZERKA MORENO Right. Okay. And what does he do? 

00:09:45
LORI He is beginning law school. 

00:09:50
ZERKA MORENO Ah. Who's paying for all this? 

00:09:55
LORI Loans . . . and we both work as well. 

00:09:55
ZERKA MORENO Are the loans piling up on you? Are they burdening you a bit? 

00:10:00
LORI Um, we, we're not too concerned because they're low interest loans and . . . 

00:10:05
ZERKA MORENO Okay. 

00:10:05
LORI . . . and we're . . . 

00:10:05
ZERKA MORENO You have low interest loans in Nevada. Move to Reno, Nevada to get low interest loans. Okay. Good. Where would you like to begin, Lori? What would be for you a significant moment? For instance, is that, um, an area of concern, obviously, or you wouldn't be coming up. 

00:10:20
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:10:20
ZERKA MORENO What is the area of concern for you? By the way, did you sign the blank already? 

00:10:25
LORI Yes. 

00:10:25
ZERKA MORENO Okay. You definitely should. Let me make also, uh, say a word of caution here in the group. Please remember that although this is not a therapy session you are responsible with me, co-responsible with me, for Lori's welfare and for all the people she brings in here. So whatever happens here today should not go beyond this room by you. You're not to carry it beyond this room. Is that clear? Yeah? It's not the hypocritical, it's the extension of the hypocritical. It often happens that people are so enthused about what happened in this session that they need to, want to share it with someone. Uh, I would recommend that you just don't do that. Uh, if you w-, want to think about it and talk with someone about it that hasn't been here, change all the facts like we do when we write up a case history for publication. All the names, all the facts, all the whereabouts, everything. But, preferably, no. It is better if we don't. Okay. That make you feel a little better? 

00:11:30
LORI Yes, thank you. 

00:11:30
ZERKA MORENO Is there anything you need to say to the audience, Lori? It's a group, it's not really an audience, it's a group. It's a large group, I grant you, but they're still a group. 

00:11:35
LORI Yes, yes. 

00:11:35
ZERKA MORENO What would you like to say? 

00:11:40
LORI I actually can't think of anything. 

00:11:40
ZERKA MORENO You feel all right? 

00:11:45
LORI I feel all right. 

00:11:45
ZERKA MORENO Okay. When's the last time, what I, uh, what we do in psychodrama, we take dramatic license. For instance, scenes in life are often attenuated. They may repeat themselves, right? Like meeting for dinner in the evening, what is your day been like. Right? Kind of thing. 

00:11:55
LORI Mm. 

00:12:00
ZERKA MORENO They repeat themselves and then little pieces come out on Tuesday, another one on Thursday, another one on Saturday.In psychodrama we take the essence of many of these similar scenes and contract them into one. It's very much like I always say, Hamlet, the story of Hamlet covers four, about four and a half hours, right? The play. But within that period Hamlet has been to England and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. And, goodness, there's all kinds of things that happened, hmm? Well, that's what we do in psychodrama. We take the essence and make a scene out of it. So you think of the scene that, for you, represents the emergence of whatever concerns you have between you. When does that happen? 

00:12:40
LORI A scene? 

00:12:40
ZERKA MORENO Mm-hmm. 

00:12:45
LORI Okay. Um, well actually the scene I'm thinking of is I'm from a family of 10. 

00:12:50
ZERKA MORENO Yeah. 

00:12:55
LORI And at holidays we always had . . . actually my parent's house and grandparents house, I have 18 nieces and nephews and everybody . . . 

00:13:00
ZERKA MORENO I'm glad I didn't ask you to put them all in here. 

00:13:05
LORI Right. But, um, there, it was a circus. Everybody came home and, and it was, I remember wrapping paper all over the floor and . . . 

00:13:15
ZERKA MORENO So this is Christmas time you're talking about. 

00:13:15
LORI Yes, at Christmas time. And that's the thing, the scene I've been thinking about lately, and I've been very much missing my family, and mostly children. 

00:13:30
ZERKA MORENO So it goes beyond Baron then? 

00:13:30
LORI Yes. 

00:13:30
ZERKA MORENO We are actually dealing with the family of origin . . . 

00:13:30
LORI Yeah. 

00:13:30
ZERKA MORENO . . . in some way. Would you prefer to deal with that and, sort of, confront them all? Uh, do you plan to go and see them at Christmas? 

00:13:40
LORI No. 

00:13:40
ZERKA MORENO Well then, we can have our Christmas party here. That's exactly . . . now it's very curious that in psychodrama very often the, the deepest catharsis comes from re-doing those scenes that have happened. That is doing them and then doing them in a more satisfactory integrated . . . 

00:13:55
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:13:55
ZERKA MORENO . . . way for us. But another aspect is doing those scenes, those relations, those interactions that re-, that cannot happen for whatever reason, may not happen, and are unlikely to happen because these people may have been deceased. Hmm? Or dead perhaps, passed away, or, or, died out of your social atoms . . . 

00:14:15
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:14:15
ZERKA MORENO . . . and disappeared from your life. And still you need them here to complete something. So that's fine, that's, that's, but let's not make too many because we've got an hour's time. But that's an excellent way to start. Let's take the people who are really essential to you here, all right? Let's step up on the stage. Are we, we including Baron in this? 

00:14:35
LORI Well the reason that I, it's an issue for us is that that scene, um, to me, has created a longing to have my own family and to have, start . . . have children. 

00:14:45
ZERKA MORENO Do we need to have a conversation with Baron about that? 

00:14:45
LORI Um, I think that would be helpful. 

00:14:50
ZERKA MORENO Okay. Shall we go on up? We've had the steps removed here to the front. Now let's see what we're going to be doing here. Why don't you go on up. 

00:14:55
LORI Okay. 

00:14:55
ZERKA MORENO And take your little . . . all right. We've got it, I think. Good. 

00:15:05
LORI Okay. 

00:15:05
ZERKA MORENO It's really quite a mystery, this business with the cords. I don't usually work this way as you can imagine in my own theatre, or anywhere else for that matter. All right. Where, what time of day are we? Could it be tonight, tomorrow night? When do you anticipate having this particular confrontation again? 

00:15:25
LORI After he gets done with finals. 

00:15:30
ZERKA MORENO Which is when? 

00:15:30
LORI Actually, when I get home from this conference. Shortly thereafter. I would say next week. 

00:15:35
ZERKA MORENO Give it a time. A specifici time. 

00:15:35
LORI Um. 

00:15:35
ZERKA MORENO It doesn't have to be . . . we, we won't check up on you or anything. 

00:15:40
LORI Okay. 

00:15:40
ZERKA MORENO Time. Putting, placing in time anchorages us in reality, too. Otherwise, time is a flowing thing. It just goes on endlessly. Well, it doesn't. 

00:15:50
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:15:50
ZERKA MORENO We don't have endlessly, okay? You place it somewhere. 

00:15:50
LORI Okay. I'd say in the evening. 

00:15:55
ZERKA MORENO Yeah? What day will you anticipate? 

00:15:55
LORI Um . . . 

00:15:55
ZERKA MORENO Will it be immediately after you get home, or when you have a day or two to, to think about, integrate what you've learned here? 

00:16:05
LORI I would probably wait until things . . . 

00:16:05
ZERKA MORENO Calm down? 

00:16:05
LORI . . . calm down a little bit, yeah. 

00:16:10
ZERKA MORENO Okay. Next week sometime. 

00:16:10
LORI Yeah. 

00:16:10
ZERKA MORENO Tuesday? Wednesday? 

00:16:15
LORI Um, Tuesday. 

00:16:15
ZERKA MORENO Good. Okay. 

00:16:15
LORI Okay. 

00:16:15
ZERKA MORENO And what time? 

00:16:15
LORI Um . . . oh, 7:00 in the evening. 

00:16:25
ZERKA MORENO Are you sitting down at the dining room table? 

00:16:25
LORI Um . . . 

00:16:25
ZERKA MORENO Or have you eaten already? 

00:16:25
LORI We'll probably be in, sitting on the couch. 

00:16:35
ZERKA MORENO Not probably. 

00:16:35
LORI We will be sitting on the couch. 

00:16:35
ZERKA MORENO Life is not probably, it is. 

00:16:35
LORI Okay. 

00:16:35
ZERKA MORENO Hmm? Okay. You're sitting on the couch. 

00:16:35
LORI Okay. 

00:16:35
ZERKA MORENO See, we mingle the as if and the reality, because if you, if you don't do that you don't get a sense of what the bridging is between these two dimensions of experience. Life is full of that. I mean, you already have all kinds of schemes in your head, but not many of them do not come to immediate realization, all right? They're sort of postponed, especially now. All right. In the living room. Now normally, Lori, we would go through setting up of the scene . . . 

00:17:00
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:17:00
ZERKA MORENO What does your living room look like, what does it feel like to you, what do you like about it, the colors, the shapes, the sizes, and so on. But I'd like to cut it short, otherwise we don't have time to get to the action. 

00:17:10
LORI Okay. 

00:17:10
ZERKA MORENO I hope that's all right with you. Some protagonists are ready the minute they step foot in, um, on the stage? Are you ready? 

00:17:20
LORI Sure. 

00:17:20
ZERKA MORENO Now, don't say to please me. You know, it's not ending . . . the point of . . . 

00:17:25
LORI Well, let me share with you. I just have one concern, and that is I didn't consult my husband about sharing this kind of thing . . . 

00:17:35
ZERKA MORENO That's correct. 

00:17:35
LORI . . . with a group. 

00:17:35
ZERKA MORENO Why don't we focus on the family and your relationship because you, there is a pull. 

00:17:40
LORI Uh-huh. 

00:17:40
ZERKA MORENO Huh? And, in fact, what I had planned on today was to put some kind of, uh, role reversal with members of the intimate family. Now, it is true that once you're married they're not quite as intimate, but they're still there with you. You bring them with you invisibly also into the marriage, right? And it, it's also part of the desire to have a family. By the way, just, what, when do you think you'll be able to have that? 

00:18:05
LORI Well, we had basically set up that we, we would work on a family when I got, after I got my Ph.D. 

00:18:10
ZERKA MORENO Which would be when? 

00:18:15
LORI Which should be, um, depending on when I get when I my dissertation done. 

00:18:15
ZERKA MORENO Yeah, all right. 

00:18:15
LORI I would say about three years. 

00:18:20
ZERKA MORENO Okay. And Baron will be through law school by that time? 

00:18:25
LORI Yes. 

00:18:25
ZERKA MORENO And have a job? 

00:18:25
LORI Maybe. 

00:18:30
ZERKA MORENO Yes, how is it with getting a job for lawyers? There seems to be an, an over-, a terrible glut of lawyers right now. 

00:18:35
LORI Definitely. 

00:18:35
ZERKA MORENO That's a concern of yours, too? 

00:18:35
LORI Well, through my experience I've always had to make money myself and . . . 

00:18:40
ZERKA MORENO Mm-hmm. 

00:18:45
LORI . . . I've never been really worried about it. I know that . . . 

00:18:45
ZERKA MORENO Ah, but if you get pregnant and have a baby, who's gonna earn the money? 

00:18:50
LORI Well, I realize that that's a practical issue . . . 

00:18:50
ZERKA MORENO Right. 

00:18:50
LORI . . . and I haven't been focusing so much on that. I think because . . . 

00:18:55
ZERKA MORENO It's still in the future. 

00:18:55
LORI Yeah, I haven't focused on the practical issues because I don't feel that it's an option to me. 

00:19:00
ZERKA MORENO Mm-hmm. 

00:19:00
LORI And I haven't even really been thinking about it, because . . . 

00:19:05
ZERKA MORENO But the yearning is there. 

00:19:05
LORI . . . our deal was to wait . . . the, the yearning is there. 

00:19:05
ZERKA MORENO All right then, let's travel. Where do we go to the family? Do we go to mother and father's house, or whose house do we go to? Your house . . . 

00:19:15
LORI Yes, mother's . . . 

00:19:15
ZERKA MORENO . . . of your family of origin? 

00:19:15
LORI Yes, mother and father's house in Minnesota. 

00:19:20
ZERKA MORENO Whereabout? 

00:19:20
LORI Um, it's in the country, next to a church. 

00:19:25
ZERKA MORENO Right. 

00:19:25
LORI Well, that's, that's the home that I remember. 

00:19:30
ZERKA MORENO Okay. I want to say the houses we have lived in are very dynamic, uh, things. They're, they are not just things, they are part of our life. Rooms we have created for ourselves, houses we have created. In other words, our living space . . . 

00:19:45
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:19:45
ZERKA MORENO . . . the nests we have had to leave. Uh, these are all very important and significant to us, and sometimes we have done a, a complete psychodrama on one room with every detail in it. The room you have created that's most important to you, and we get an awful and tremendous amount of information. Also we let, uh, some protagonists do the spirit of the house. For instance, if you, do you think about the spirit of your house sometimes? 

00:20:10
LORI I think so. 

00:20:10
ZERKA MORENO Uh-huh. 

00:20:10
LORI I have a feeling when I think about . . . 

00:20:10
ZERKA MORENO All right. Let's start with the r-, role reversal with the house. Can you be the house? 

00:20:15
LORI Okay. 

00:20:15
ZERKA MORENO Okay. 

00:20:15
LORI Okay. 

00:20:20
ZERKA MORENO How big are you, house? 

00:20:20
LORI I'm quite large. 

00:20:20
ZERKA MORENO You are? 

00:20:20
LORI Yes. 

00:20:20
ZERKA MORENO Could you show us, sort of, the roofline with your arms, and are you square roof, are you pointy roof? Look at yourself. Close your eyes a minute and, and visualize. 

00:20:30
LORI Okay. 

00:20:30
ZERKA MORENO What are you like? 

00:20:35
LORI Okay. I'm not . . . 

00:20:35
ZERKA MORENO Role reversal with significant objects because they are not really objects, they also become personalized in some way to us. Yeah. 

00:20:45
LORI I'm not . . . 

00:20:45
ZERKA MORENO This is, are you the house that Lori grew up in? Excuse me. 

00:20:45
LORI Uh-huh. 

00:20:45
ZERKA MORENO Are you the house Lori grew up in? 

00:20:45
LORI Yes. 

00:20:50
ZERKA MORENO Okay. All her life? 

00:20:50
LORI No. Um, I moved to a different house when I was a junior in high school. 

00:20:55
ZERKA MORENO Ah, you are now the house. 

00:20:55
LORI Um . . . 

00:20:55
ZERKA MORENO Good. 

00:20:55
LORI Okay. 

00:20:55
ZERKA MORENO Let me teach you role reversal. 

00:20:55
LORI Okay. 

00:20:55
ZERKA MORENO House, how long did Laura, Lori, live in you? 

00:21:05
LORI Lori lived in me 'til she was, um, in the middle of her junior year of high school. 

00:21:10
ZERKA MORENO Then what happened? Where did she go? 

00:21:10
LORI Then she moved to a different . . . I'm a parsonage. 

00:21:15
ZERKA MORENO Ah. 

00:21:15
LORI And she moved to a different parsonage that was smaller and, uh, was not as, um . . . 

00:21:25
ZERKA MORENO The master of the house is a minister, then? 

00:21:25
LORI Yes. 

00:21:25
ZERKA MORENO Yes, but this house is in particularly important to Lori. Is this why she brought you here, or should she have brought the, the house she moved into later? 

00:21:35
LORI Well . . . 

00:21:35
ZERKA MORENO Or is this family back in this house, in you? 

00:21:40
LORI No. The family's in a different than both of these that I've described. 

00:21:45
ZERKA MORENO Step out of this again. 

00:21:45
LORI Okay. 

00:21:45
ZERKA MORENO If you were to go home to Minnesota, which house would you go to? 

00:21:50
LORI I would go to a house that I never lived in. 

00:21:50
ZERKA MORENO So you don't know it? 

00:21:55
LORI I know a little bit . . . 

00:21:55
ZERKA MORENO You know a little bit. Uh-huh. 

00:21:55
LORI It . . . 

00:21:55
ZERKA MORENO It's not important to you. 

00:21:55
LORI Right. 

00:21:55
ZERKA MORENO So you feel that this house next to the church, the bigger one, is important to you? 

00:22:05
LORI Yes. 

00:22:05
ZERKA MORENO There were things in your life that were also important that were happening at the time? 

00:22:10
LORI Yes. 

00:22:10
ZERKA MORENO Back. Go back to that house. 

00:22:10
LORI Okay. 

00:22:10
ZERKA MORENO Can you show me a little bit about the shape. You, you are large. How many rooms do you have? 

00:22:15
LORI Oh, boy. I, I don't think . . . 

00:22:15
ZERKA MORENO Well, look inside of yourself. Look inside yourself, you know? 

00:22:20
LORI Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:22:20
ZERKA MORENO First floor, second. How many floors are you? 

00:22:20
LORI Okay. there's a big basement . . . 

00:22:25
ZERKA MORENO Uh-huh? 

00:22:25
LORI . . . that was always messy. 

00:22:25
ZERKA MORENO Ah-ha. That is always . . . 

00:22:25
LORI That is always messy. 

00:22:30
ZERKA MORENO Okay. 

00:22:30
LORI And then there's, there's the main floor. 

00:22:30
ZERKA MORENO How many rooms there? 

00:22:35
LORI And I have a big living room . . . 

00:22:35
ZERKA MORENO Mm-hmm. 

00:22:35
LORI . . . and a guest room. 

00:22:40
ZERKA MORENO Mm-hmm. 

00:22:40
LORI And a bathroom and a l-, little, what we called the little hallway which was a place . . . 

00:22:45
ZERKA MORENO Oh, no, you don't call it, that house. 

00:22:45
LORI What, what? 

00:22:45
ZERKA MORENO Do you call it, the house? 

00:22:45
LORI Oh, no. What . . . 

00:22:45
ZERKA MORENO The family calls. 

00:22:50
LORI What the family called the little hallway. 

00:22:50
ZERKA MORENO What I'm teaching you is removal from the self, objectification and removal from the self. In role reversal you're not speaking as yourself, although it is your perception of this space. As much as possible it's to teach the distancing between this, this object, this important house, and oneself. Yeah. 

00:23:05
LORI Okay. So, okay. There's . . . the family calls this little, um, cubby hole, the little hallway . . . 

00:23:15
ZERKA MORENO Okay. 

00:23:15
LORI And then . . . 

00:23:15
ZERKA MORENO We don't, not going to have time to go through all the house. 

00:23:20
LORI Okay. 

00:23:20
ZERKA MORENO I would like to have the sp-, you're, the spirit, and I would like to have the shape. 

00:23:25
LORI Okay. 

00:23:25
ZERKA MORENO If we have time we can go through all the rooms because the living space is also a dynamic category. The space you live in, your territory, but we don't have time for this today. Um, what's the most, where's the room where this family's going to gather? 

00:23:40
LORI The living room. 

00:23:40
ZERKA MORENO The living room . . . 

00:23:40
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:23:40
ZERKA MORENO Let's stick with that, then. 

00:23:40
LORI Okay. 

00:23:40
ZERKA MORENO And how many people have lived here? 10 people? Eight? Seven? 

00:23:45
LORI Um . . . 

00:23:45
ZERKA MORENO Before, Lori mentioned eight. Is that eight siblings, or is that six siblings and two parents, or the grandparents involved? How many generations are here at this time that we're looking at? 

00:23:55
LORI Oh, okay. It's, it's the mother and the father and, um, I started out holding, I think it was seven . . . 

00:24:05
ZERKA MORENO Uh-huh. 

00:24:10
LORI And then the older ones starting going to college. 

00:24:10
ZERKA MORENO Okay. So that's with the parents, five children and seven, and two adults, or how many . . . 

00:24:15
LORI Um, seven children and two adults. 

00:24:15
ZERKA MORENO So it's nine people. 

00:24:20
LORI Nine at the . . . 

00:24:20
ZERKA MORENO Okay. 

00:24:20
LORI . . . at the most. 

00:24:20
ZERKA MORENO Okay. 

00:24:20
LORI Actually it was probably eight. 

00:24:25
ZERKA MORENO Cuz of people leaving? 

00:24:25
LORI Yeah, seven people were, had already gone off on their own before . . . 

00:24:30
ZERKA MORENO Okay. 

00:24:30
LORI . . . um, they moved to this . . . 

00:24:30
ZERKA MORENO Good. What's your shape of your roof. I still haven't seen that. Can you, um, portray that? Is that possible? 

00:24:35
LORI It's ki-, it's, it's . . . 

00:24:35
ZERKA MORENO Do you spread out your arms? Are you sort of spread or are you high? 

00:24:40
LORI I'm very solid and chunky. 

00:24:45
ZERKA MORENO Solid and chunky. Let's see that with your arms. Yeah, (inaudible[00:24:51). That's good. 

00:24:50
LORI Um, like this? 

00:24:50
ZERKA MORENO Like that. 

00:24:50
LORI And . . . 

00:24:50
ZERKA MORENO You have wings on both sides? 

00:24:55
LORI Um . . . 

00:24:55
ZERKA MORENO Is one wing different from the other? 

00:24:55
LORI It's all very solid and rectangular, although it's, um, so com-, exactly rectangular. 

00:25:05
ZERKA MORENO I am very solid. Okay, very good. 

00:25:05
LORI I am very solid. Um . . . 

00:25:05
ZERKA MORENO What's your roof shape like? Do you have a peak or not? 

00:25:10
LORI Yes. 

00:25:10
ZERKA MORENO Can you show us your peak? 

00:25:10
LORI I have a peak and then I have a little window that comes out, and then there's, I have a chimney on this side. 

00:25:20
ZERKA MORENO Okay. What of the things we learn is how difficult it's for a person to be an object, right? We don't have the right shape, so we have only to, you know, indicate it. Hmm? And make outlines. All right. Fine. Now we're going to go to that living room, and we're going to assemble the family, all right? Uh, let's keep this space, this stand-up space here for Lori. Step out of this house, you're now Lori. See, we project you into the room and we pr, probably going to malform (ph) this room a little bit cuz we need to get everybody . . . I want it so that people can see you as you are dealing with these people or . . . 

00:25:55
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:25:55
ZERKA MORENO . . . keep them on the side. Uh, and then we'll turn them around again. Who do we put in here, for example? Here you are as Lori. Who is the first person you see sitting here? 

00:26:05
LORI Um . . . 

00:26:05
ZERKA MORENO And, again, we don't have time to go into the living room space as it should be, which is it, regular psycho-, in, in this role reversal type thing as we're doing now in an hour, we cut, we're short cutting a great deal. 

00:26:15
LORI Yeah. Um, the first person I saw there was my father. 

00:26:20
ZERKA MORENO Ah, okay. Now, I don't want you telling about father. 

00:26:25
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:26:25
ZERKA MORENO I'd like you to become your father. Can you do that? 

00:26:25
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:26:30
ZERKA MORENO All right. I'd like, uh, very much to meet you. Uh, Lori brought you here today. Uh, can you tell me, first of all, in the ranking of the family, where does Lori rank, sh-, among the seven children or eight children? The eighth? 

00:26:50
LORI It's 10, it's 10 children . . . 

00:26:50
ZERKA MORENO 10 children, excuse me. 

00:26:50
LORI . . . and Lori is number nine. 

00:26:50
ZERKA MORENO Number nine. 

00:26:50
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:26:55
ZERKA MORENO There's one younger than she. 

00:26:55
LORI Yes. 

00:26:55
ZERKA MORENO Mm-hmm. How many boys and how many girls? 

00:27:00
LORI Five and five. One for each commandment. 

00:27:00
ZERKA MORENO Well you did really well, didn't you? 

00:27:05
LORI Yes, I'm very proud of my family. 

00:27:05
ZERKA MORENO What denomination are you? 

00:27:10
LORI Lutheran. 

00:27:10
ZERKA MORENO Lutheran. You didn't hear my joke that I gave the other day about Moses coming down from the mountain? 

00:27:15
LORI Uh, no. 

00:27:15
ZERKA MORENO The children of Israel met Moses coming down from the mountain as he was carrying these two plaques. Huh? 

00:27:25
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:27:25
ZERKA MORENO And they said, "Well?" And Moses said, "Well, I'll the good . . . there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is I kept the old man to 10." Yes, I know you're laughing, "but the bad news is adultery stays in." We use humor, too. All right. Very good. To you we have the 10 commandments here. Wait, what commandment does she represent? I've forgotten the order. Which is the ninth? 

00:28:05
LORI Nine. Um, it's something about do not covet, um . . . 

00:28:10
ZERKA MORENO Uh-huh. 

00:28:15
LORI . . . thy neighbor's something. 

00:28:15
ZERKA MORENO You don't know it yourself, father? I'm surprised. I'm sure you know it, the 10 commandments. 

00:28:20
LORI I do know it. 

00:28:20
ZERKA MORENO Uh-huh. Could you tell us what it is? 

00:28:30
LORI Um . . . 

00:28:30
ZERKA MORENO Can someone prompt? 

00:28:30
UNKNOWN The wife. 

00:28:35
LORI The wife? 

00:28:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:28:35
LORI Okay. 

00:28:35
ZERKA MORENO I picked . . . 

00:28:35
LORI I know it's not the man servant and the maid servant. 

00:28:40
ZERKA MORENO . . . I picked the right joke, right? Um, are you in good health, sir? 

00:28:45
LORI Oh, excellent health. 

00:28:45
ZERKA MORENO How old are you? 

00:28:45
LORI I'm 65. 

00:28:50
ZERKA MORENO 65. Are you going to go on working? 

00:28:50
LORI Oh, I'll probably work 'till I die. Um, although I'm, I've retired from the ministry. 

00:28:55
ZERKA MORENO You have? 

00:29:00
LORI Actually, at this time I'm, I'm in the ministry and I haven't thought about retiring. 

00:29:05
ZERKA MORENO You're still working? 

00:29:05
LORI Yes, yes. 

00:29:05
ZERKA MORENO Do you love your daughter Lori? 

00:29:10
LORI Very much. 

00:29:10
ZERKA MORENO Have you ever had any conflict with her? 

00:29:10
LORI No. Lori's always been very good. 

00:29:15
ZERKA MORENO Yes. Good in what way? 

00:29:20
LORI Well, she's, she does what she's told to do. Um, she's also, um, helps her mother, looks out for people. 

00:29:35
ZERKA MORENO She's living far away from here. Do you miss her? 

00:29:40
LORI Yes, we miss her very much. 

00:29:40
ZERKA MORENO I understand it may be difficult for her to come at Christmas time. Is that correct? 

00:29:45
LORI Yes, we wish she could. 

00:29:45
ZERKA MORENO How do you feel about that? 

00:29:50
LORI I feel a sense of loss. 

00:29:50
ZERKA MORENO I'm sure you do. I'm going to bring Lori here today and let her confront you. 

00:29:55
LORI I'd like that. 

00:30:00
ZERKA MORENO And tell you, maybe, about her own sadness. Hmm? About not being able to be here. It's quite hard on her, you know? Okay. Take a minute to come out of the . . . there we have tears. It's very, very quick that that happens, you know? Lori, it's okay to cry. You think your dad would cry, or is this Lori crying? 

00:30:20
LORI Lori. 

00:30:20
ZERKA MORENO Yes, of course. Where are our tissues? We always have some tissues. Here. Thank you. Okay. Thanks so much. Yeah, let's leave them here. Thanks so much. Yeah, you're lonely for them, hmm? Yeah, sure you are. Okay. Do you need to cry some more, or it's just the shock of recognition how lonely you are that did this? 

00:30:45
LORI It's okay. 

00:30:50
ZERKA MORENO Yeah. Okay. Let's stand up, then. 

00:30:50
LORI Uh-huh. 

00:30:50
ZERKA MORENO And would you like to sit down in front of him and talk with him? And would you like someone to represent him or would you like to leave this chair empty? We have these riches here that I don't have when I work in an (inaudible ) situation. Namely, a lot of people who are available. And you can, if you like, have a stand-in for your father. Would you like that? 

00:31:10
LORI Sure. That's . . . 

00:31:10
ZERKA MORENO Would that be useful? 

00:31:10
LORI . . . that sounds good. 

00:31:10
ZERKA MORENO Or would you prefer to keep the chair empty? The choice is yours. Can you see him better if you leave the chair empty, or can you deal better with him if there's someone there? The advantage is for having someone there is, of course, you can have, have a hug or something like that if you need to. 

00:31:25
LORI I would like to try it with someone. 

00:31:25
ZERKA MORENO Good. Can you see people here? Can you see their faces and . . . 

00:31:30
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:31:30
ZERKA MORENO Can you . . . 

00:31:30
LORI Yeah. 

00:31:30
ZERKA MORENO Yeah? Would you . . . 

00:31:35
LORI The first part, yeah. 

00:31:35
ZERKA MORENO Okay. Would you, would you like to indicate someone? It is hard against the lights here, by the way . . . 

00:31:40
LORI Yeah. 

00:31:40
ZERKA MORENO We're a bit, little bit blinded by the lights. 

00:31:40
LORI Well I can describe my father and (crosstalk ). 

00:31:45
ZERKA MORENO Yes, you can describe your father and then, see, if someone feels, he or she, by the way, uh, we often have a male, uh, represent a female and, and female by a male. Uh, that's not true, of course, if there are sexual connotations involved, but we're concerned about the personality and the kind of contact the person can build. So who, how, what does your father look like? 

00:32:05
LORI He . . . 

00:32:05
ZERKA MORENO No, let's not do that. Let's go down the steps. You go down the steps (crosstalk ). 

00:32:11
LORI Well, I see someone over there that . . . 

00:32:11
ZERKA MORENO Oh, you see someone over there. 

00:32:11
LORI Yeah, that looks similar to my father. 

00:32:15
ZERKA MORENO Where? 

00:32:15
LORI The white shirt and the red tie. 

00:32:15
ZERKA MORENO Ah, the gentleman over there. Yes. 

00:32:15
LORI Yeah. 

00:32:15
ZERKA MORENO Correct. 

00:32:15
LORI You. 

00:32:20
ZERKA MORENO You see how quickly the conne-, the communication takes place? 

00:32:20
LORI Uh-huh. 

00:32:20
ZERKA MORENO All right. Very Good. 

00:32:25
LORI My father's a good looking man. 

00:32:30
ZERKA MORENO What's his name? 

00:32:30
LORI Art, Arthur. 

00:32:35
ZERKA MORENO Arthur. What do you call him? 

00:32:35
LORI Dad. 

00:32:35
ZERKA MORENO Dad. Very good. Sorry about these little interruptions, all right? 

00:32:45
LORI It's okay. 

00:32:45
ZERKA MORENO Who do we put next to dad when we go on. In order to save time, do we put mom there or who should be there next to him? 

00:32:50
LORI Well, I think because my scene, the way it relates to children . . . 

00:32:55
ZERKA MORENO Uh-huh. 

00:32:55
LORI Um, I'd probably like to have a niece, um (crosstalk ). 

00:33:03
ZERKA MORENO Very good. And you're washing your hands. What's the mat-, matter? Are you nervous about this? What's happening here? Look at your hands. What are you doing with your hands? 

00:33:10
LORI Yeah. 

00:33:10
ZERKA MORENO Yeah. What do, uh, your hands giving you a message? 

00:33:15
LORI Um, I think so. I'm not sure what it is. 

00:33:20
ZERKA MORENO What could it be? 

00:33:25
LORI I think I'm scared of having dad here. 

00:33:30
ZERKA MORENO Ah, yes. Why? What does he, is he imposing to you in some way? Is he intimidating? 

00:33:35
LORI Well, it's hard for me to be me with him. 

00:33:40
ZERKA MORENO Right. I understand that he's very restraining, hmm? Yeah? 

00:33:45
LORI Yeah. 

00:33:45
ZERKA MORENO Correct? Hmm. Is this the way father sits? Why don't you sit for a moment and show us how father sits, so that the, these auxiliary (ph) can, can take the role. 

00:33:55
LORI Okay. 

00:33:55
ZERKA MORENO How do you sit, Arthur? 

00:33:55
LORI I sit very straight. 

00:34:00
ZERKA MORENO I sit very straight. With your back . . . 

00:34:00
LORI And . . . 

00:34:00
ZERKA MORENO . . . against the chair? 

00:34:00
LORI Um, I think so. Yes. 

00:34:05
ZERKA MORENO Yes. Do you sit . . . 

00:34:05
LORI And . . . 

00:34:05
ZERKA MORENO Uh-huh. 

00:34:05
LORI I, I s-, sometimes cross my legs. 

00:34:10
ZERKA MORENO Cross your legs. Mm-hmm. What do you do with your hands? 

00:34:20
LORI I think I leave them free to talk with. 

00:34:20
ZERKA MORENO You move them? 

00:34:25
[sil.] 

00:34:30
LORI Um . . . 

00:34:30
ZERKA MORENO It's very interesting that we know people intimately and we still, we're so used to them that we don't even record anymore what they do, right? All right. 

00:34:40
LORI I think so. 

00:34:40
ZERKA MORENO You think so. Good. 

00:34:40
LORI I'm a very dynamic parent. 

00:34:40
ZERKA MORENO You are? Mm-hmm. Are there any questions you have? 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN No. 

00:34:45
ZERKA MORENO Let's try it then. Thanks so much for coming up. This is a conversation that may never take place. We would like it to be, feel, not only to have the kind of difficult conversation you have with your father, the kind of conversation you might not have with your father. That's the whole point. The free you . . . 

00:35:00
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:35:05
ZERKA MORENO To expand your communication with him. They never have to happen . . . 

00:35:05
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:35:10
ZERKA MORENO . . . but the fact that you can have it here will help you in some way in relation to, to your father out there. 

00:35:15
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:35:15
ZERKA MORENO Okay? 

00:35:15
LORI Okay. 

00:35:15
ZERKA MORENO Sit down. How f-, distant do you want to be from him? 

00:35:15
LORI Um . . . 

00:35:20
ZERKA MORENO Would it be this far away? Is there a table between you as you see it? 

00:35:25
LORI Yeah, I see . . . 

00:35:25
ZERKA MORENO Uh-huh. 

00:35:25
LORI I feel more comfortable having something. 

00:35:25
ZERKA MORENO Okay. Some, some kind of barrier between you. 

00:35:30
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:35:30
ZERKA MORENO A square table, oblong one? 

00:35:35
LORI Um, I don't see any furniture . . . 

00:35:35
ZERKA MORENO Okay. 

00:35:35
LORI . . . in front of us. 

00:35:35
ZERKA MORENO Just, uh, b-, some, this, this is comfortable for you? 

00:35:40
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:35:40
ZERKA MORENO Okay. Go ahead. 

00:35:45
LORI Well, first of all, I want to tell you that I really admire the way you . . . you are with little children, and I can understand why little children call you Jesus sometimes. 

00:36:05
[sil.] 

00:36:05
ZERKA MORENO It's all right. Let the tears come. Quite all right, let it happen. 

00:36:25
LORI I mean, I don't often miss you as much as I miss the little children . . . um, because I'm not sure if you've ever accepted the parts of me that are actualizing now, and actualizing now that the good little girl that you knew is only a small part of who I am. And I really feel very strongly that you don't want to know those other parts of me, especially the strong woman. 

00:37:05
ZERKA MORENO Mm-hmm. Can you tell him something a little more specific about what you've discovered about these other parts of you, the strong woman, professional person, a married woman, potential mother? Hmm? And other areas of your life that you discovered that he can't possibly share? 

00:37:25
LORI Well, you always say that you're proud of me and I understand that, that to be proud of me for my academic achievement, and, and my ambition, and in a sense you're inspiration has helped me to be ambitious and, and even helped me to actualize the masculine, quote stereotypical masculine, side of me. And, and so I don't feel like you restrained me in that way and yet there's another part of that, the strength, the, um . . . the thinking for myself. But I . . . 

00:38:05
ZERKA MORENO Does that part ever get angry at father, not just sad? 

00:38:10
LORI Yes. 

00:38:10
ZERKA MORENO Isn't it? Okay. 

00:38:10
LORI Very angry. 

00:38:10
ZERKA MORENO Okay, let's take another chair for that angry voice that's, um, we don't always get a chance to express. So let's get over in this other chair here that's . . . that's one part of, um, you, Lori, that you haven't been able to express because afterwards you don't want to injure him. He has been a good father. You know, good parents are far more problematic in a way than bad parents. The trouble is is that good parents you can't really be angry at and the fact is that they interweave goodness and badness, the good parts and bad parts. Now if you can deal with the bad . . . 

00:38:45
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:38:45
ZERKA MORENO . . . parts separate from the good parts, hmm? It's a little bit easier. Otherwise, if we, if we just do away with them altogether we lose mom or pop altogether, and we don't want to do that. But we would like to get o-, over some of these difficult hurdles with them, wouldn't we? And so people who are, are really good are so guilt producing because, yes, because, uh, children, how can you reject a parent who's so good, right? So let's separate these (inaudible ). Is that okay with you, dad? 

00:39:16
UNKNOWN You bet. 

00:39:16
ZERKA MORENO Okay. 

00:39:16
LORI That's a perfect man's sudden statement. 

00:39:20
ZERKA MORENO Yes, indeed, and he isn't even from Minnesota. only from Pennsylvania. See, we're far more alike than we are different. Okay. good. Go ahead. Tell him about . . . when you're angry is the voice loud in you, the angry voice? Or is it subdued? 

00:39:40
LORI It can be very loud. 

00:39:40
ZERKA MORENO Yeah, I would like it to be loud that . . . and I tell you what I'd like you to do. I'd like you to get up and stand on this chair. He won't look quite so big. And now I'd like you to use . . . the high chair and the low chair are very, very useful levels. We used to have a bal-, we have a balcony in the theatre in Beacon. Man, that makes you powerful. Okay? See, he doesn't look quite so intimidating now. Does he or doesn't he? 

00:40:05
LORI Even more . . . well, I don't fe-, he doesn't feel as intimidating. 

00:40:10
ZERKA MORENO Good. Okay. 

00:40:10
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:40:10
ZERKA MORENO Now let's hear that voice. 

00:40:15
LORI Okay. 

00:40:15
ZERKA MORENO This is not your father, hmm? That gives you the freedom. He's not gonna get a heart attack, or get upset, or hold it against you. He's just like I am in this reluctant (ph) chair. We are neutral instruments to the extent that these emotions are not really related to us. They're related to the role you are portraying, hmm? 

00:40:30
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:40:30
ZERKA MORENO If they upset you then we'll have to deal with that at another ti-, another session. Do you have a daughter, too? 

00:40:40
UNKNOWN No, I don't. I have sons. 

00:40:40
ZERKA MORENO Would you like to have a daughter? 

00:40:40
UNKNOWN Sure. 

00:40:40
ZERKA MORENO Well, here you are. 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN Just like her. 

00:40:45
ZERKA MORENO Just like her. Splendid! You have the license to go ahead. 

00:40:50
LORI Okay. I'm angry with you for . . . teaching me . . . 

00:41:00
ZERKA MORENO Is there a stronger voice you can produce? Don't forget you're in Reno, Nevada and he, he's in Minnesota. 

00:41:05
LORI I'm angry . . . 

00:41:05
ZERKA MORENO And I want a real loud voice. 

00:41:10
LORI I'm angry with you for, for teaching me to be such a good girl, and for stroking me so much for being what you wanted me to be. And I'm angry that you're not, w-, would, never willing, or rarely willing to lov-, to listen to me when I was strong, when I had an opinion, when I maybe knew something more than you did. And there were plenty of those times, and I remember you laughing or saying how cute I was. 

00:41:50
ZERKA MORENO That diminished you in some way. 

00:41:50
LORI Yes. It diminished me in many ways and I still have visions of that. 

00:42:00
ZERKA MORENO When you get angry which, uh, apparently you don't allow yourself very often overtly, do you feel it in your stomach somewhere, in your body? What do you feel? 

00:42:05
LORI I'm just feeling tension around . . . 

00:42:10
ZERKA MORENO Uh-huh. 

00:42:10
LORI . . . my arms. 

00:42:10
ZERKA MORENO Okay. All right. In order to release that tension I'm going to take you a little further away. Let's take off this chair here and, um, in space go far away from him, because you really are far away from him. Go as far as you can get with that umbilical cord. Okay. Can you get further? Okay, and get on a chair there. Okay. You can get further than I can apparently. Okay. And now he is a little hard of hearing. Parents are often hard of hearing when it comes to children especially the most, and I'd really like you to let go. And really be a bad girl. It's hard to be a bad girl when you've been a good little girl. Haven't you ever wa-, haven't you ever wanted to . . . 

00:43:05
LORI Yes. 

00:43:10
ZERKA MORENO Of course. Do you wanna do it on this chair or from the, do you want to do it on the floor? Is it better on the floor? All right. Now, give, let, let, give it a go! And, and jump around and you'll . . . you like children. You know how children do it. They have no hesitance, do they? Okay. See if you can do just as much as you can. 

00:43:30
LORI It's scary. 

00:43:30
ZERKA MORENO It is. Would you like some help . . . 

00:43:35
LORI All right. 

00:43:35
ZERKA MORENO . . . with it? 

00:43:35
LORI Yeah. 

00:43:35
ZERKA MORENO Or do you think you wanna do it alone? 

00:43:35
LORI I think I'd like some help . . . 

00:43:40
ZERKA MORENO We sometimes use a double, a person who will double for you, helps warm you up. Can we have, uh, have a double? She'll help you be looser . . . 

00:43:45
LORI Okay. 

00:43:45
ZERKA MORENO . . . about it. And I'd like my double to stand on this side and you need a mic, too. The double should as much as possible i-, t-, establish identity with the protagonist. She will not take over for you and she'll not, I don't wanna talk to her, I wanna talk to you. Her to talk to you. So let's hear some of those inner voices and you can correct, but don't correct too much. Just pick it up and carry it on and carry it to him. 

00:44:15
UNKNOWN How angry are we really at him? 

00:44:15
LORI I'm, think I'm afraid to even realize how angry I am. 

00:44:20
ZERKA MORENO Right. 

00:44:20
UNKNOWN Shall we try it out? I'll try it out, okay? 

00:44:25
LORI Okay. 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN Ooh! 

00:44:30
ZERKA MORENO C'mon. 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN How's that feel? 

00:44:30
ZERKA MORENO Can it, will it help if the group will help you, too, start yelling at him? That's often very helpful. We . . . 

00:44:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:44:40
ZERKA MORENO Take the what down? 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN She's saying father may be behind the pulpit. 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:44:45
LORI That's a good suggestion. 

00:44:45
ZERKA MORENO All right. Go ahead. 

00:44:50
LORI Now I'm in the pulpit. 

00:44:55
ZERKA MORENO Right. Right. 

00:45:00
LORI And I think you can learn something from me. I think you can learn that I'm okay the way I am. I'm okay when I'm not good. In fact, I'm better when I'm not good! 

00:45:20
[sil.] 

00:45:20
ZERKA MORENO Tell him why you're better. 

00:45:25
LORI I have personality, I have richness. I have a lot more love there because when I loved because I had to and I had to do it in the way you wanted me to, I didn't feel it. 

00:45:40
ZERKA MORENO It wasn't honest. 

00:45:40
LORI It wasn't honest. It was acted and I felt so guilty because I didn't think I knew how to love. I didn't think I knew how to really be good or be Christian because you told me exactly how to do it, and I was too afraid not to, to explore anything else. And I need permission to be bad in order to be good. And I . . . 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN Sometimes it feels like I need that permission from you. 

00:46:10
LORI Yes, I need that permission from you. 

00:46:15
ZERKA MORENO Okay, let's get that permission from him. Thanks so much. You've been very helpful. Let's role reversal for a moment. Can you be, pick up the last few sentences here. Can he be you for a minute? 

00:46:25
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:46:25
ZERKA MORENO Sometimes we pick a woman, if not a girl, to do that. But let's see if you can go to the pulpit there and your queue is . . . 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN Um. 

00:46:35
ZERKA MORENO . . . just the last two words. I need your permission to be good. 

00:46:40
LORI To be bad. 

00:46:40
ZERKA MORENO Be bad. And, yet, that's good. You said I'm better when I'm . . . right? I need your permission to be bad. 

00:46:50
UNKNOWN I need your permission to be bad. 

00:46:55
ZERKA MORENO Louder! 

00:46:55
UNKNOWN I need your permission to be bad! 

00:47:00
ZERKA MORENO Now take your, take your time, father. And respond to that. 

00:47:05
LORI I don't understand what this psychology stuff has done to you. 

00:47:15
ZERKA MORENO Would you let her know what way you don't understand her? You don't understand what she's asking for, is that it? 

00:47:25
LORI Yes, that's true. I don't understand. I don't understand how I could condone badness or evil. 

00:47:35
ZERKA MORENO I understood Christ to be quite, uh, have a quite a different position in that, in that he loved, that you couldn't, only sinners can become saints. 

00:47:45
LORI That's true. I would agree with that. 

00:47:45
ZERKA MORENO Mm-hmm. 

00:47:50
LORI And yet that ideally should be goodness. 

00:47:50
UNKNOWN Sure. 

00:47:50
ZERKA MORENO How can we transform that badness into goodness in your terms? 

00:48:00
LORI Forgiveness. 

00:48:05
[sil.] 

00:48:05
ZERKA MORENO Ah. Would you ask for forgiveness? 

00:48:15
UNKNOWN Could you forgive me like Jesus forgave all of us? 

00:48:20
LORI Of course. 

00:48:20
UNKNOWN Will you? 

00:48:25
LORI Yes. 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN Why don't you do it? 

00:48:30
LORI It sounds like you're asking for two different things. 

00:48:35
ZERKA MORENO Do you still need something from your daughter, Arthur? 

00:48:40
LORI Yes. 

00:48:40
ZERKA MORENO What do you need from her? 

00:48:45
LORI I need to know . . . 

00:48:45
ZERKA MORENO Can you show her? 

00:48:45
LORI . . . she loves . . . I need to know you love me, and that you respect me, and that you've learned something from me. 

00:49:00
ZERKA MORENO All right, let's reverse roles. Thank you. 

00:49:05
UNKNOWN 

00:49:10
ZERKA MORENO It's all right. Okay. Are you hearing what he's saying? He needs something from you. Will you, uh, will you listen to that? Hold it a minute and let me tell you. You need to have something from her. You need . . . 

00:49:30
UNKNOWN I need to know that you love me, I need to know that you learned something from me . . . what was the other one? 

00:49:40
ZERKA MORENO Need to know that you respect me. 

00:49:40
UNKNOWN And I need to know, above all, that you respect me. 

00:49:45
[sil.] 

00:49:50
ZERKA MORENO Now that's his need. 

00:49:50
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:49:55
ZERKA MORENO What do you do with that? 

00:50:00
LORI You know, dad, I love you and I love you . . . 

00:50:05
ZERKA MORENO Do you want distance when you tell him that or do you want to come closer? How distant do you want to be? 

00:50:10
LORI I wanna be distant right now. 

00:50:10
ZERKA MORENO Fine. Good enough. 

00:50:15
LORI And I love you for being human and I don't think you've been willing to show me that as much as I would like you to. You tried so hard to always have all the answers . . . 

00:50:30
ZERKA MORENO To be perfect. 

00:50:30
LORI . . . to be perfect. And I love you for what I know is true, that you're human and you're vulnerable, and sometimes you get very scared. 

00:50:50
ZERKA MORENO In fact, he's so vulnerable he lets you know he needs to hear from you that you love him. 

00:50:55
LORI Yes. 

00:50:55
ZERKA MORENO Mm. He probably needs something the same, the same thing from you that you need from him. 

00:51:00
LORI I wanna love you but I don't wanna have to take care of you. 

00:51:05
ZERKA MORENO Okay. Do you want to be taken care of by him? 

00:51:10
LORI Yes. 

00:51:10
ZERKA MORENO Come. We're gonna give you the reformed father. That's all right. Maybe you don't even need to get (inaudible ) with you. We've used the reform of the auxilliary ego.. So a long time since you've had this girl on your lap. You both need to look, to love, give, give to each other and love each other. And be the little girl inside that needs to be loved, to be good. It's true you need to be loved as an adult, but it starts also this way sometimes, does it? Do you feel nice? Is it, is it nice for you this way? 

00:51:45
LORI It's scary. 

00:51:45
ZERKA MORENO Yes, of course, it is. 

00:51:45
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:51:45
ZERKA MORENO Right? Put your arm around (crosstalk ). And Maybe dad should take his glasses off. That's another, sometimes another barrier. And now let him know how much you love him, how much you need him to show his love to you in all your dimensions. 

00:52:00
LORI I need to know a couple things. I need you to take care of me instead of me always feeling like I have to take care of you. I need you to be strong enough to love the bad in me, and to accept me and have faith in me. You're always talking so much about faith and I often don't feel that. 

00:52:40
[sil.] 

00:52:45
LORI I not only want you to accept the whole me, I want you to try and, I want you to want to know it, know me. And . . . 

00:53:00
ZERKA MORENO Before it's too late. 

00:53:00
LORI . . . before it's too late. 

00:53:05
[sil.] 

00:53:10
ZERKA MORENO Look at him. You want to get to know her, too, don't you dad? This dad does. Mm-hmm, very much. What would you like to say, dad, from your heart? 

00:53:30
UKNOWN I'm sorry to have caused you so much pain. 

00:53:30
ZERKA MORENO Mm-hmm. 

00:53:35
UNKNOWN I failed as a father. 

00:53:40
LORI Mm. I don't think you failed as a father. 

00:53:40
UNKNOWN I didn't make it safe enough for you, where all this pain you're feeling, all this hurt, comes from. Am I not being good enough? 

00:53:50
LORI No, it's from you being too good. 

00:53:55
ZERKA MORENO Ah, yeah. Uh-huh. Not human enough, maybe. Hmm? 

00:54:00
LORI Yeah. 

00:54:00
ZERKA MORENO Not fallible enough. 

00:54:00
LORI Although you, you're very human . . . 

00:54:00
ZERKA MORENO Mm-hmm. 

00:54:05
LORI Your temper tantrums . . . a lot of . . . sometimes you're like a little child. And . . . 

00:54:10
UKNOWN So how can you think of me so perfect when I screw up in so many ways? 

00:54:15
LORI I don't know. Maybe sometimes I resent you for not being more perfect . . . 

00:54:20
UNKNOWN And I . . . 

00:54:20
LORI Maybe I'm doing the same thing to you that you're doing to me. 

00:54:25
ZERKA MORENO Maybe we need to have this out together on some level at some time? 

00:54:30
LORI Yes. 

00:54:35
ZERKA MORENO You trust enough in each other's love so we can show it. You think you can eventually? Not now, obviously. There's time to work that out. Well, what are you going to do? You ever hug him? Yes, that's feedback. Now that's feedback, that nasty noise. There's something you'd like to say from your heart, other than from the role? 

00:55:05
UNKNOWN You're a nice person, kiddo. You've got nothing to worry about at all. 

00:55:10
ZERKA MORENO Thoroughly healthy. Lovely. Thank you, very much. Very kind of you. Before you go, you have sons, you said? 

00:55:25
UNKNOWN Two. 

00:55:25
ZERKA MORENO Two. Do you feel that you have anything like this in your life with your sons, or is this very different? 

00:55:35
UNKNOWN Yes, I . . . 

00:55:35
ZERKA MORENO I think it'd be good for her to have you share that. That's something that she needs to hear, right? 

00:55:40
UKNOWN I guess I'm, uh . . . 

00:55:40
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:55:40
UNKNOWN I'm very much aware of how my sons, uh, hold me in awe, and it drives me crazy that they hold me in so much awe. 

00:55:50
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:55:55
UNKNOWN Um, I'm just, um, I'm just struggling along as well as I can, and, uh, I make a lot of mistakes and I know it. And, they're, I think they're both doing a real good job, you know? 

00:56:05
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:56:05
UNKNOWN And I don't want them to be afraid of me or, or to be threatened by me, or to think that I'm, don't think they're doing well. And, you know, I'm so big, you know? 

00:56:10
LORI So's my dad. 

00:56:10
ZERKA MORENO How old are they? 

00:56:15
UNKNOWN Uh, they're, uh, seven and three. 

00:56:15
ZERKA MORENO Ah, is your dad big too, Lori? Yeah, that's right. 

00:56:15
LORI Yes. Yes, 6'1". 

00:56:20
ZERKA MORENO You get on their level with them? 

00:56:20
LORI Yeah. 

00:56:20
ZERKA MORENO Yeah, you have to. 

00:56:20
UNKNOWN I get under 'em.

ZERKA MORENO I'm sure. Um, I think what we don't, what, what we have a hard time realizing is our parents are learning to be parents with each one of their children, and it is different for each one of the children, and it's developmentally very complicated. 

00:56:40
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:56:40
ZERKA MORENO Because there's only one person but there are so many children, right? So there is . . . a father role is not a single role. It is a multiplicity contained within that father complex and it's really hard to know which child needs what. So we have to teach our parents who we are. We really do, don't we? 

00:57:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, and although I don't know your father I would be willing to guess that he'd be willing to listen, because he can't be all that different from you, you know? 

00:57:10
ZERKA MORENO Right. 

00:57:10
UNKNOWN I mean, in some ways you must be very much like. 

00:57:10
LORI We are, very. 

00:57:15
ZERKA MORENO That's part of the problem, too. 

00:57:15
LORI Yes, definitely. 

00:57:15
ZERKA MORENO That it's often easier to talk to people who are not so alike and not so identifiable. 

00:57:20
LORI Yeah. 

00:57:20
ZERKA MORENO Good, thank you. You're, you've been very kind. Yes, thank you. (inaudible ). I want Lori, I would have liked to have gone into much more of your family. I thought this was a, a crucial beginning, but certainly the business of the child and the little niece whom we missed. It's our sad loss, m-, more perhaps than yours . . . 

00:57:45
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:57:45
ZERKA MORENO . . . that we couldn't bring that to fruition, too. I want to tell you something about myself. In the psychodrama usually, by the way, we do sharing with a group, and people come up and share from their own life. Not your life, but talking about themselves, our daughters and sons and mothers and fathers, and grandparents and God knows what, brothers and sisters. I learned the first time I had to play my mother's role in the psychodrama with my sister, I found very, very difficult because I was still very enmeshed with her. And although I had come to the other end of . . . she lived in England, I came to this country, I was 20-some years old, I found it very hard to define the areas of my distinction. This is me and this is you. And very much had the same kind of . . . 

00:58:30
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:58:30
ZERKA MORENO . . . enmeshment that you have. We learn to separate that and psychodrama helps us to do that. 

00:58:35
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:58:35
ZERKA MORENO In fact, you can go home and use this for yourself any time you need to. You can bring dad and you can bring all the members . . . 

00:58:40
LORI Mm-hmm. 

00:58:40
ZERKA MORENO . . . of your family. And try and produce for yourself not only what you think he would respond, but what you need from him, because in learning what you need from him, you can convey to him what you need. And I'm getting to the stage, a little older than your father, when I don't want to leave unfinished in my life if I can avoid it. I'm sure he doesn't want to do that either, right? You've been beautiful and refreshing and honest and courage and we love you. Good luck to you. 

00:59:25
[sil.] 

00:59:30
ZERKA MORENO And may you have that beautiful baby you want. (inaudible ). I'm going to be, I'm in the process of being a grandmother myself and I can tell you that it's a great joy, also for your parents. Good luck with Baron. 

00:59:40
LORI Thank you. I enjoyed working with you. 

00:59:40
ZERKA MORENO Yes.
