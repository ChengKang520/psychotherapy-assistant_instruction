CHERISH Welcome to the natural environment series on teaching verbal behavior presented by Establishing Operations, Incorporated. 

00:00:05
HOLLY Because we recognize the importance of teaching communication through motivation, this natural environment series will focus on teaching language to your child based directly on what motivates them. 

00:00:15
CHERISH This initial DVD is focused on teaching your child the very first requests or mands. You'll learn what to teach, how to teach it correctly, as well as many important problem-solving strategies. 

00:00:30
HOLLY It's our sincere hope that through watching these DVDs, you're able to teach your child how to effectively use language to communicate their wants and needs. 

00:00:35
Natural Environment Teaching. 

00:00:35
CHERISH Before getting into the details of natural environment teaching, we want to review with you what verbal behavior is. BF Skinner is the author of the book, "Verbal Behavior". In his book he looked at the function of words rather than their form. For example, the word "ball" is just one word when you look at its form, but when you're looking at its function it has several different meanings. If a child wants a ball and says the word "ball" this is called a mand. It means I want that ball. With the mand, you are asking for the thing you want. The function or reinforcer for saying ball in that situation is that the child gets the ball. Of all the functions we will mention in this video, this is the only one that directly benefits the child. And it's also likely the only one in which the child is going to talk first. Another meaning of the word "ball" can be as a label or what Skinner referred to as a tact. This is when someone says ball when they see a ball, but they don't really want it. The function or reason they say it is to get social reinforcement from another person. Someone could also say ball as the answer to a question. We would call this an intraverbal. So, if I said to my child, "Hey, what bounces?" And he said, "Ball" that would be an intraverbal and yet another function of the word ball. What about when someone reads the word ball? That's yet another function. Now, if I said the word ball, and my child immediately said the word ball back to me, this would be an echoic and another function or meaning of the word ball. If I asked my child to go get their ball and they did, that would be what we would call receptive and is another meaning of the word ball. Skinner believed that you didn't truly understand the meaning or have the concept of the word until you could use it for all of its possible functions. But for this DVD, we are focusing on one meaning of the word ball, which is the mand or request. Hopefully, that brief tutorial on the meanings of the word will help you understand the rest of the information presented. Now we would like to explain what we believe natural environment teaching is. We'd like to clear up some misconceptions about what it is and what it isn't. The first misconception is that natural environment teaching is determined by where you are when you're teaching. This isn't true. It's defined or determined by what you are talking about. We believe that when you are talking about to the thing that has value to the child you're working with in that moment, that is natural environment teaching. When all the responses the child is giving to you are related to that thing that they like a right then, that's natural environment teaching. So, you can see it doesn't matter where you are but rather what you are talking about in that moment. You could be at the table talking about things they like. You could be on the floor talking about things they like. You could even be in the swimming pool or anywhere as long as you and the child are talking about things that the child likes. Let me give you a few illustrations. Let's say Joey is at the beach having a great time. I've got a bucket and a shovel. Joey really wants the bucket and the shovel. So, I sit down with him and show him the shovel. And I say to him, "What's this?" And he tells me, "shovel". Then I say, "That's right. Now you can have it." And I give it to him. Now I hold up the bucket, and I say, "What do you put sand in?" And he says, "A bucket." And I say, "Yes, what do you want?" And he says, "Bucket." Then I give him the bucket. This is an example of natural environment teaching because Joey is motivated for the bucket and of the shovel. All the things Joey just said were related to the bucket and the shovel. Now let's do another example. We are still at the beach with Joey, and he still wants the bucket and to the shovel. I'm holding the bucket and shovel and say to him, "Clap your hands." And he claps. I say, "Give me a high five." He gives me a high five. I say, "What's your name?" He says, "Joey." Then I give him the shovel. Then I say to him, "Hey, tell me a color." And he says, "Blue." Then I give him the bucket. This particular example demonstrates intensive teaching. None of those responses that Joey just gave were related to the bucket or the shovel. Let's do one more example to make this point more clear. Joey is still at the beach, and now Joey is in the water, and I have a raft that Joey likes. He wants to get on the raft. So, I say to him, "Hey, tell me something that helps you float on the water." And Joey says, "Raft." And then I say, "where do you want to go?" And he says, "Up." So, I pick them up, and I put him on the raft. This is another example of natural environment teaching. I want to give one more scenario that to an untrained observer will look like natural environment teaching, but really it isn't. I'm giving this example as a warning for you to make sure that it's not happening within your teaching. You may have a situation where you are still at the beach, and you have the bucket and the shovel. Your child is sitting in front of you, and he's picking up sand and dropping it in front of his eyes over and over again. You hold out your shovel, and you say, "What do you dig with?" And he says, "Shovel." So, you give him the shovel. But, he continues to drop sand in front of his eyes. Now, you hold up the bucket and say, "What do you put sand in?" He says, "A bucket." And you say, "What you want?" He says, "Bucket." And, you give him the bucket. Now he has the bucket and the shovel, but he's ignoring them while still dropping the sand in front of his eyes. This is not natural environment teaching. It would actually be intensive teaching without a reinforcer. The reason is, the reinforce for that child in that moment is dropping sand in front of his eyes, not to the bucket or the shuffle. You can see how someone watching you would probably think that's natural environment teaching because you are talking about a bucket and a shovel. But in that moment, they were not to the thing that had value. Natural environments teaching should be all about the child's motivation in the moment. This is what makes it so difficult to do. You have to think about what to teach, how to teach it and keep the motivation high for the items you're using. You also need to look for shifts in motivation levels. You don't want to them to stop enjoying the activity because then it's no longer natural environment teaching. Let's move on now and start talking specifically about how to teach the first mands or requests to our early learners. For our purposes we classify early learners as children who are limited in the number of things they are able to ask for or mand for appropriately. Even if this child is able to label a thous items and answered loads of questions, if they cannot ask for things that they want we would still consider them early in the natural environment. We believe without the ability to mand for items, actions, attention and ultimately information, the child may never become conversational. When we teach our early learners in the natural environment, we want to teach them that communicating, whether it's sign or focal, then it's fun. We want to them to learn if I talk or sign, good things happen. If I talk I get. If I sign I get. We want to get to their rate of talking or signing much higher. We recommend that early learners spend a larger proportion of their therapy time in the natural environment setting. The exact percentage depends on how weak the mand repertoire is. If they are not able to ask for any items or activities they enjoy, we might even recommend that they spend all of their time in the natural environment learning to ask for things that they want.

00:08:00
Teaching the First Mands Using Sign Language 

00:08:00
CHERISH Let's now talk about all the manding skills you'll need to teach to your early learner in the natural environment. For the purposes of this DVD, we are limiting our discussion to children who are unable to consistently echo what you say. Now this can vary from children that don't even try to echo what to say to those that attempt to echo but their words just aren't quite clear enough. Let me give you an example of this. Let's say that Joey makes vocal attempts for different things that he wants. Now a couple of people around the Joey say that they can understand him, but not everybody can understand him. Now because of this, the team isn't sure if they should use sign language or vocalizations as his response form. This example is not uncommon. When you are trying to make a decision as to which response form to use, there's a couple of things you can do. The first thing is if you think the vocalizations are pretty good but you're just not quite sure, you can run a little test with unfamiliar listeners. What you would do is bring someone in who is not familiar with the child, give them a paper and a pen, and then just have them turn their back to the child. Then you want to get mom, dad, a therapist, whomever just to try to get that child to say some words. When the child talks, the listener will write down everything that they think that that child is saying. Then you can compare what was actually said to what was heard by the unfamiliar listener and find out if they were able to understand your child. If that person did understand what your child was saying, then we would definitely go with vocal. 

00:09:30
1. Unfamiliar Listener Test 

00:09:30
2. Echo Mand Trials 

00:09:30
HOLLY If the unfamiliar listener was not able to understand that child out of the context that they were talking, it doesn't mean we are automatically going to use sign language. What we want to do at this point is take a couple of things into consideration. Now, one thing to consider is whether or not that child has ever had any formal mand training before. If they've never had practice being taught that if they say what you say good things happen to them, we are going to start by doing some echo manding trials to see if we can get some improvement on their vocals. Now, we don't go into detail on this DVD about what the echo mand procedure looks like. This is typically a vocal procedure, and you will find more details about it on the vocal manding DVD. But, to clarify with the echo mand procedure, we typically wait for the motivation for something to be present then before we give it to the child we say the name of the item and we wait two seconds to see if they will echo us. If they don't echo what we say, we continue in this manner for up to three presentations of the word, and then we deliver the item regardless of whether or not they say the word. If they do echo what we say after any one of the three times that we said the word, we give them the item right away and we end of the trial. The version of this procedure that you will use with your nonvocal child will vary from the original procedure that I just briefly described because now we are going to reinforce that child on the best articulation of the word. So here's an example. Let's say we have a piece of candy. My child really wants the candy, so I come to my child and I say, "Candy." The child says, "Ka." I say, "Candy." He says, "Kuhkuh." That was better, so I'm going to deliver the candy for that one. Then what I can do is over time and across subsequent trials is to keep delivering on the best approximation I got of the word and then reassess the vocalizations after one week. Did the articulation improve significantly? If so, we will probably keep using that procedure and keep reassessing it on a weekly basis. If there wasn't a significant improvement, we recommend immediately going to sign language as the response form for that child. Here's why. What if your child walks into the kitchen and says, "Kah." You of course, you want to reinforce their vocalizations. So, you're probably going to start trying to think of anything in the kitchen that starts with "Kuh". Cracker, cookie, candy. You might even begin opening up cabinets or the refrigerator just to see if you can try to figure out what he wants so you can reinforce that vocal attempt. But what if that same child walked into the kitchen and went like this, and says "Kuh". He doesn't even want anything in the kitchen. He wants to go in the car. Without that sign, you would have not been able to reinforce that vocalizations specific to the motivation because you wouldn't have known what the motivation was for. Now, if we can get the sign in there, we can better figure out what it is that they are trying to say and then we can directly reinforce that vocalization. Once the signs are strong, we can really focus on the vocalizations and sometimes we can shape up the vocals to where the child doesn't even need sign anymore. When we decide to use sign language, it's never under the belief that the child will not talk. We want all of her children to ultimately talk, and this is why we are motivated to use sign language as a bridge to get the vocalization s. 

00:13:05
How to Teach Sign 

00:13:05
HOLLY Let's talk more now about how to teach sign. When you are ready to teach sign language to an early learner, you don't need to start by taking a sign language class. You just need to get a book or a good website where you can look up what the signs are supposed to look like as you're ready to teach them. Make a list of your child's favorite things then look them up in the book or online. Learn how to perform the signs yourselves and then come to your child ready to teach them. Now, before I show you the procedure, I need to tell you that if your child has no motor imitation skills whatsoever, they can still learn sign language. In the beginning we might modify some of the signs that we teach so that it's easier for them to learn. So for example, instead of teaching the sign for water like this, I might teach it like this, which is an approximation of the sign for water. We want our modifications to look similar to the actual sign whenever possible so that later we can shape them into the exact form if necessary. Now we also want to make sure that when we are modeling the sign exactly as we want our child to perform it. If you have a child that doesn't like to be touched, you're not going to be able to prompt them right away using this procedure. First, you have to just pair touching their hands with good things. When they are happy for you to touch them and shape up their hands into various positions, then you can start teaching the sign. Now, when you are teaching a child with little or no motor imitation at all, then you have to start at the level I'm about to show you. Let's say I'm trying to teach the sign for candy. I know that this is the sign for candy because I looked it up. So now all I have to do is remember three keywords. Model, prompt and give. 

00:14:55
Model Prompt Give 

00:14:55
HOLLY If you can remember those three words, that's all there is to it. You are also going to see the name of the item with each one of those steps. Let me show you this with Cherish. Model, prompt and give. Try to prompt the child to sign using their dominant hand. Every time I do this, I should be saying candy, candy, candy so that she here's what it's supposed to sound like. Here's what that looks like. Candy, Candy, Candy. You want to be very quick. If you do it really slowly, you could end up in a physical battle with your child. Your child is trying to get to the candy. Now you're trying to figure out okay, I have to model. Then I need to sign, prompt. Next thing you know, you're in a physical battle with your child right here. That's not good. Your child is trying to get the candy. You're trying to push their hand away toward their face. You don't want that. In some situations it's best to actually cut out your model prompt altogether. Just physically prompt your child and then give them the item. You want to make sure you do this fast so the next thing they know, they've got the candy right there in their mouth. They don't even realize how it got there. After a few trials, your child starts to realize oh, this happens right before the candy goes in my mouth. This movement starts to get correlated with the reinforcement. Let me show you some videos of this. The first video I'll show you is Thea, who is an excellent therapist and mother working with her own child in this video. Her son, Suray(ph) has learned a lot from her. In this first clip, Thea is teaching Suray how to ask for a brand-new item he's never asked for before. When you watch this clip, I want you to pay particular attention to how she models the sign, prompts Surey's hands to form the sign, and then she gives him the item. 

00:16:50
Model Prompt Give 

00:16:50
THEA Suray want beads? Beads. Suray wants beads? Here you go. Some beads. All right. 

00:17:00
HOLLY She models, prompts and gives it. 

00:17:00
Model Prompt Give 

00:17:00
THEA Yogurt. Yogurt. Yogurt. Good. Nice. Pudding. That's good, good. Good stuff. 

00:17:15
HOLLY Now, she was a little slow on the give here. You want to make sure that as soon as he signs, the yogurt is right there in his mouth. That's what's going to closely correlate the sign with the item. Let's watch some more. 

00:17:30
THEA What's this one here? 

00:17:30
HOLLY Now she held up the drink. Maybe he wants a drink now. Drink is already a mastered sign meaning that she she has already taught him that one. So he goes like this, and she gives him the drink. It's important if possible to mix in those mastered signs while you are teaching the new ones. Sometimes we will wait until we're able to fade our prompts just a little bit on a new target mand. We will then get some independent attempts from that child and then we will immediately start bringing in some mastered items so we can contrive the motivation for those while we are teaching the new targets. When we do this it helps your child to discriminate between the different signs right from the beginning. You want to be ready to prompt if it's needed so that you are doing errorless teaching. 

00:18:20
Errorless Teaching 

00:18:20
HOLLY This means that you are preventing errors before they can occur. When this is done correctly the procedure can prevent some problems that we will discuss later. 

00:18:30
THEA What's this? This is a slinky. Remember the slinky and ball? That's a ball. Ball. Ball. All right. You get to the ball. 

00:18:40
HOLLY What happened right there is great. Thea grabbed the slinky which had a ball all tangled up in it. Now, she's trying to contrive the motivation for the slinky. But Suray saw the ball. He was reaching for the ball not the slinky. Many therapists I've seen would have prompted Suray to ask for the slinky regardless because that's what they've were focused on. But Thea's focused on Suray. She sees that he's reaching for that ball so she forgets about the slinky, and she prompts the sign for ball. And did you notice how she gave him the ball immediately after he signed it? Even though it was still tangled up in the slinky it didn't matter. Suray doesn't care. He just wants the ball right away and it's important to follow his motivation. If Thea were to make him wait he would leave. The motivation would completely die. But now, while he is playing with the ball via can then untangle it. 

00:19:30
THEA Ball. All right. That's a colorful ball. Yeah. 

00:19:40
HOLLY Most of the examples you just saw were full physical prompts. Thea modeled, prompted and then gave Suray the items. Notice that it was varied as well. It wasn't just the same item over and over and over again. By mixing it up she's helping to keep motivation high for Suray. Now it will be important for Thea to start fading her prompts. 

00:20:00
[sil.] 

00:20:00
Fading Prompts: Fade Physical Prompts First. 

00:20:00
UNKNOWN With children using sign it so important that you fade your prompts quickly. The first prompt we want to fade is how much we physically touch that child. If you continue to prompt a signer after they don't need prompts anymore, they might become prompt dependent. What they might do is they might walk up to you and just give you their hands, almost like they're saying to you, "I want something. Prompt my hands." You don't want that. On the same note, you can get prompt dependency if you don't start to fade the amount you touch their hands before they are independent with the sign. So while you are teaching, always be aware of what your child is doing. Now, start to be aware of the pressure you're using to prompt the child so you can be aware of your child's hands when they move underneath your hands, even just a little bit when you prompts them. The second you start to feel their hands move under yours, that's when you start to fade your prompts. Let me show you this in Suray's video. Now, the slinky here is the new target. This is the sign for Suray. Now, Thea is still working at the full physical prompt level with this, where she models it, prompts his hands, and then gives the slinky. Take a look. 

00:21:10
THEA Yeah. Slinky. 

00:21:15
HOLLY Now right here she shows in the slinky. He puts his hands up to grab it, and see how his hands are up like this just to grab it? That's an independent movement for Suray. That's a big deal for him. He made an independent movement. We want to capitalize on those movements. So what Thea could have done right there is one his hands came out like this, she could've taken her pointer fingers and put them on the outside of his hands and then maybe just put pressure to push them together. Maybe even she could have just tried tapping on the back of his hands with her pointer fingers. She could see if by doing this she could get him to sign a slinky a little bit more by himself by touching him a little bit less. Now, Thea does this in the next clip. She's going to feed her prompts a little bit by putting a little less pressure and then by touching his wrists instead of his hands. Let's watch it. 

00:22:05
THEA Slinky. Slinky. Here you go. Nice. Slinky. 

00:22:15
HOLLY That's your goal. Can I touch him just a little bit less and get some independent movement from him at all. If Thea tried fading this way and it worked, she would then want to differentially reinforce. 

00:22:25
Differential Reinforcement 

00:22:25
HOLLY Now, differential reinforcement is an important concept that you'll hear us talk a lot about. When a child engages in a behavior that's better than their previous attempts, you'll want to make sure that that child gets more reinforcement for that response. One way of doing this could be to give a little bit more of the reinforcer. So maybe, give two chips instead of just one. Another way would be to give the reinforcer for a longer period of time or longer duration. So if the reinforce was a movie for example, you could let him watch it for a little bit longer than you normally would. That might help increase the future frequency of the better responses because the child contacts more reinforcement. Another way to know that you can start to fade your prompts is if your child starts to sign independently. Now sometimes your child will sign independently, but the sign won't look perfect. In those cases, as long as it's close reinforce. We want to reinforce independence over accuracy in the very beginning. So, if for example, I'm teaching the sign for water like this, and the child goes like this, I'm going to reinforce. Once I get them making that independent approximation more consistently then I can start to shape the sign into what it's supposed to look like. I'd rather have a less-than-perfect independent sign then have the child not learn or become prompt dependent. 

00:23:55
One Way to Fade the Model Prompt: Fading by Time 

00:23:55
HOLLY Another way you can fade your prompts is to wait by time. Only run this procedure after you've done enough teaching trials and your child is starting to either sign independently or requires significantly less touching from you. When you're ready to do this, you'll contrive the motivation and then wait. You can wait for up to nine or ten seconds. Then when they sign for the item, give them the item immediately. Now, teaching in the natural environment is different than teaching in the intensive teaching environment. You can wait up to 9 or 10 seconds with a mand. Sometimes we have to do this with the mand in order for the child to learn to mand independently. There are three times when you would not want to run this procedure. Number one is if you haven't done enough teaching trials. Number two is if the child is gonna get frustrated or upset. And then number three if the child is going to form the wrong sign and make a mistake. 

00:24:50
When NOT to fade by time: 1. Not enough teaching 2. Child gets frustrated 3. Child will make a mistake 

00:24:50
HOLLY If you've done enough teaching and the child will likely be successful with this procedure, that's when we will use it. Let's watch some video of this procedure. On this video you will see Denise teaching Andrew. Now watched Denise teach the mand to using full physical prompts, and then she gradually fades by time after she's taught enough trials. 

00:25:10
DENISE Bubbles. Bubbles. Bubbles. Bubbles. 

00:25:30
[sil.] 

00:25:30
HOLLY These were both full physical prompts. Denise signed bubbles. She prompted Andrew's hands to sign bubbles, and then she blew the bubbles. You saw this twice. In this next part, you're going to see Andrew sign more independently. Denise is ready to prompt, but Andrew beats her to the punch, and he signs bubbles. Now even though Denise touches him here, you can see that she doesn't really need to. 

00:26:00
DENISE Bubbles. Bubbles. 

00:26:10
[sil.] 

00:26:10
HOLLY Now, Denise realized that she didn't need to touch him so much here. She noticed Andrew's independent manding for bubbles. So this time, Denise is gonna try to fade by time to see if he can do it all by himself. 

00:26:30
[sil.] 

00:26:30
DENISE Bubbles. Bubbles. 

00:26:40
HOLLY Did you notice how Denise had her hands up while he was signing? She was ready to give that model prompt just in case he needed it. Another point I want to make about this video is that during the part you just saw, Denise left the DVD playing while Andrew was asking for the bubbles. This brings up a good point. Sometimes during your session you'll see this. The child will ask for one thing, and then the therapist will remove everything else before they reinforce the mand. That can actually punish the child for asking for things. If Andrew were to ask for bubbles and then Denise immediately stopped the DVD player, the value of the DVD player would increase in that moment because he just lost it and now he wants it back. Now, if Denise prompted Andrew to sign bubbles in that exact moment that the value of the DVD player was high, she may actually be prompting him to ask for them when he doesn't want them anymore. Now he wants the DVD player. This could result in the therapist's unintentionally prompting a mand when the child is not motivated. That's a huge mistake that can cause problems and resultant errors with this sign later. Another thing that could happen from this is that she could be punishing the mand for bubbles. So basically you're saying to the child, "If you ask for bubbles, I'm taking your DVD player away." So instead, it's just best to do what Denise did here and do leave the DVD player going while Andrew asks for the bubbles. He can have more than one thing. That's okay. 

00:28:05
Fading the Motor Imitation Prompts 

00:28:05
HOLLY At the point where you are ready to fade, we fade out the physical guidance first like you saw in the previous clips. Now, after you are able to touch the child less and less, you'll have completely faded out the physical touching. You'll usually be left now at the level of the motor imitation. So now when you sign it, they can sign it, and then you can give them the item. When you get to this point where they can sign it just because you did first, stay at this level for a little while. Try not to be hasty to move on from this prompt level right away. You want to make sure that the mand is strong at the level of the imitation before you move on, especially if it's a brand-new skill. Now here's another video clip of fading by time. This is Andrew again, and you'll see in this video that the sign for french fry is at the level of the motor imitation. Denise signs fries. Andrew signs fries. No problem at all. 

00:29:05
DENISE Fries.Fries. 

00:29:15
[sil.] 

00:29:15
DENISE Fries. Fries. Fries. 

00:29:30
HOLLY On each of those previous trials, he signed because she signed. Now watch Denise fade that by time. 

00:29:35
DENISE French fry. 

00:29:40
HOLLY He signed it on his own. She didn't even have to sign it for him before he signed it right there. He did it all by himself. She could've used to differential reinforcement by giving him more fries or even by letting him stick his entire hand in to get his own. 

00:29:55
DENISE French fry. 

00:29:55
HOLLY She had to go back to the model prompt. 

00:30:00
DENISE French fry. 

00:30:05
HOLLY He did it with her that time. That counts as independent, and Denise differentially reinforces. 

00:30:10
Second Way to Fade the Model Prompt: Mimetic to Mand Transfer Procedure 

00:30:10
HOLLY Another way you can fade the model prompt is by using what we call a mimetic to mand transfer. With this one, what you're doing is requiring your child to sign twice before they get to the thing that they want. So if I was running this procedure, and I wanted my child to learn to ask for water without me signing it first, I would provide a mimetic prompt. So, I would sign water, and my child would imitate and sign water back to me. But before I give the water to him, I would try to get my child to sign it one more time by himself. If he signs it one more time by himself, then I would give it to him. What I'd be reinforcing here would be the child signing the new word independently. This procedure is called the mimetic to mand transfer. Let me show you what this looks like with Cherish. Make sure your child wants it. Water. Water. Water, and I can give her the water. Notice that every single time she signed, I said the word water. Now, there's a few variations of this procedure. Another way you can do it, it looks the same but it's actually a little bit different. And this would be if I said something to her on the transfer trial. Here's what that would look like. Water. Water. What do you want? Water. And now I can give her the water. This might look a little bit more natural than just waiting, but the problem is is that if you always say something first, like what you want, the child may actually learn that they have to wait for you to say something first before they can mand. It doesn't matter what you say. Instead of saying, "What you want", you could say "huh?" Or "pardon me?" Or "What?" And it wouldn't matter because your child might still learn that they have to wait for you to say something first before they can ask. It's okay to say something sometimes on the transfer trial. Asking what do you want isn't a bad thing. Just make sure you don't always say it. Maybe even set up a percentage for yourself so that you're sure not to say it more than maybe 50 percent of the time. With some children you might get a negative side effect from the mimetic to mand transfer. What some children learn is that they have to sign the word two times before they can have the item. This can produce double signing. The child starts to sign it twice every single time. Water water. Candy Candy. Movie movie. You don't want that to happen. If this happens, we will treated as an error and we'll discuss in detail a little bit later how to handle this. Now here's a video clip of Suray again with Thea. Suray is now able to sign for popcorn if you sign it first. So now, here Thea is gonna do a transfer trial and try to get him to sign it on his own one more time. 

00:33:00
Model Prompted sign 

00:33:00
THEA Popcorn. Popcorn. Nice. What do you want? Good. Popcorn. 

00:33:05
HOLLY That was a perfect mimetic to mand transfer there. You can see that Thea was ready to get in there and prompt if she had to so that it would be an errorless trial, but he didn't even need it. Now, be sure that you are aware of also fading that readiness to prompt because that can also become a prompt. That child can actually become dependent on it to be able to ask for things. 

00:33:30
Fading the "What Do You Want?" Prompt 

00:33:30
HOLLY Let's now talk about how to fade saying what do you want for those children who need you to say that in order to be able to mand. If you followed our recommendations, and you haven't always talked first when you're teaching initially, you probably aren't going to have this problem. However, sometimes you meet children who are already dependent on this prompt. Now, if that's the case you have to fix it or they might never be able to truly mand independently. So what you can do is actually use the procedure of fading by time to fade the "What you want?" Prompt. You'll need to come to your child with something they want and that there's a lot of. For example, I could come to my child with maybe some potato chips. And he wants a lot of them. So now, I hold out my very first chip, and I know he's not able to ask for this chip unless I ask, "What you want?" Or if I actually show him the sign for chip. But, I'm trying to get rid of the what do you want prompt so I'm not going to say it. I go back to the model prompt, and I sign chip. He signs chip, then I give him the chip. Now on the next one again I sign chip. He signs chip. I give him the chip. After he eats that chip, and now he wants another one. Now I might try partial prompt and just start to model the sign for chip, but not do it all the way. He signs chip. I give him the chip. Now, on the next trial I can try waiting and not saying anything at all to see if he can sign chip. If he signs chip, I'm going to give him a couple of chips, to differentially reinforce him asking independently. Maybe I'll even let him stick his whole hand in the bag and get his own chips. After this you probably are not going to have to prompt him again for any more of the chips that are in that bag in that moment. However, please don't think you've completely fix to this problem. You'll likely need to prompt him again when he wants chips in the future. 

00:35:25
Fading the Presence of the Item (or Fading to the Motivation) 

00:35:25
HOLLY Now let's talk about the last kind of fade. At this point we have a child who when he wants something and he actually sees it, he can ask for it. No problem at all. Now we need to fade out the presence of the item itself. We want our kids to be able to mand under the same controlling variables that we mand, which is just because we want things. We don't have to see pizza to be able to ask for pizza. When we want it, we ask for it. We want our children to be able to do this as well. So we have to teach them to ask for items when they are not present. To do this, you really can't just take everything away, put it in the closet, and then expect them to ask for things. They can't make that big of a jump. We have to systematically fade out the presence of the item. Let me show you a video of this. This is going to be David, and he can ask for french fries when they are present. Now, here he's going to be using vocal as his response form and not sign language, but we wanted to show you this video because with it you can see what the procedure is supposed to look like. Now David's therapist is sitting with them, and she has the whole container of french fries. When he sees a fry, he can easily ask for one. So she's going to start there were it's easy. When he asks for a fry, she'll give him one. And then she's going to give him some time to eat it, and then for the motivation to build again. 

00:36:50
DAVID Fries. 

00:36:55
THERAPIST Nice. 

00:36:55
HOLLY Did you see what she did with her fry container? He asked for the fry when it was present, and now that therapist pulled the fry container off to the side of her body so that he can't see it as well. And now she waits. 

00:37:10
DAVID Fries. 

00:37:15
THERAPIST Okay, fries. 

00:37:15
HOLLY He asked for it. You can see that she gave him the fry, and then now watch where she puts the fries. She's going to move them even further out of sight so that she's gradually fading them away completely. 

00:37:35
[sil.] 

00:37:35
DAVID Fries. 

00:37:50
THERAPIST Fries. 

00:37:50
HOLLY He asked for the fry, so she gave him a fry. Notice that the latency was a little bit longer this time, but that it was harder for him. And it's hard for our kids to make this big of a jump from asking for the item when it's present to asking for it when it's gone as well. You really do have to systematically fade it out like this. Let's see what she does with her hands now. 

00:38:15
[sil.] 

00:38:15
DAVID Fries. 

00:38:25
THERAPIST Fries. 

00:38:25
HOLLY Just having your hand behind your back like that becomes a prompt, and that child may actually need that prompt to be able to ask for the item. That's why the therapist left the fries behind her back and then she brought her hands in front of her self into a neutral position. If you don't fade to natural conditions, your child may not be able to ask for anything in the natural setting. After it's easy for David to ask for fries in this setting, the therapist is going to fade even further so that he can ask for fry one he's two steps away from her. And later he can ask for a fry when he's in another room. Every single fade though has to be systematically chosen. It can't be too hard of a jump for that child. We want our kids to be successful. Now when the therapist was fading, if it's any point David wanted a fry, but he couldn't ask for one, the prompt would be to either flash the fries or just go back to an earlier fade where David was successful. For example, if he can't ask for the fries when her hands were in front for body, she could've moved to the last stage where he was successful and see if just putting her hands behind her back would evoke the correct mand. The important thing is that you want to rely on the item or your hands to do the prompting for you and not on your voice. It's harder to fade out your voice then these other types of prompts. Now one last important note about this procedure is that if at any point in time the child loses their motivation for the item, you have to stop teaching it. Remember, it is only a mand if the motivation is present. If the child isn't motivated, move on to teaching something that is motivating and then just come back and work on fading to the motivation at a later time when he does want it. 

00:40:15
Scrolling and Error Correction 

00:40:15
HOLLY The last thing we want to talk about is what you do if the child signs the wrong sign or does double signing like we mentioned previously. We call this scrolling. Or in some cases we simply call it an error. An example would be if the child clearly wanted french fries, but he signed movie. When scrolling occurs, we are going to run what we call the scrolling procedure or error correction procedure. First, we will push the child's hands down to a neutral position for two seconds. We will prompt the correct sign, and then we will deliver the reinforcer. Let me show you what this looks like with Cherish. Now Cherish is indicating she wants the candy, but she's scrolling. So, I want to push her hands down into a neutral position, model the sign, prompt her hand if necessary and then give her the candy. If you are running this procedure and while you are modeling the sign, they are scrolling again, then you are forced to change your plan a little bit. Let me show you what this looks like with Cherish. She really wants the candy, but she's scrolling again. So, I push her hands down. I model the sign, and she is scrolling again. I push her hands down , I model the sign. She's scrolling again. If that happens with your learner, you have to cut out your model prompt completely. Just push her hands down to a neutral position. You might want to even keep holding them and then just prompt the sign and give her the candy. Notice how I'm holding this hand down with my other hand? That's on purpose. Some kids will try to sign something different with their free hand while you are trying to prompt the correct sign with the other hand. If they do that, for example they sign fish while they are eating the candy, I try to get to the candy back. People might think that that is mean, but here's the issue. If he's eating the candy and signing fish, then that child is correlating the fish sign with the candy. This will likely make it take much longer to teach this mand if you allow this to happen. Now some people ask us, "Well, if he signing for fish, then why wouldn't you just give them the fish?" You don't want to do that because that is not errorless teaching. Clearly he doesn't want the fish. He wants the candy. Just get the error out of there, prompt the right sign and then give the item. That's what's going to help them learn faster. Let's watch a video of the scrolling procedure. 

00:42:40
Model Prompted Sign Error on Transfer Trial 

00:42:40
THEA Popcorn. Popcorn. That's what Ray wants? 

00:42:45
HOLLY Right here, we just saw that Thea signed popcorn then Suray signed popcorn. Thea then tried to get a transfer trial. She said, "What Ray wants?" And Suray rubbed his hands together, and that was the sign for movie. So now Thea's got to push his hands down and prompt the right sign. 

00:43:00
Push hands down. Popcorn 

00:43:00
THEA Hands down. Popcorn. Popcorn. 

00:43:05
HOLLY She got it right there. Right there she should give him the popcorn. This brings up a good point. If your child made a mistake on the transfer trial the last time like Suray did, don't go for the transfer trial when you are fixing the error. If you do that and you go for that transfer trial, they are likely to make the same mistake again. So, give them the popcorn right there. Now here's another clip of Thea running the scrolling procedure for Suray. 

00:43:30
Error Push hands down Prompt Sign Transfer Trial 

00:43:30
THEA Popcorn. Good boy. That's popcorn. That was nice. Would you like some more? Hands down. Popcorn. That's right. What do you want? Popcorn. Good. 

00:43:45
HOLLY Now remember, the best way to stop scrolling is to use errorless teaching and prevent it from happening in the first place. If you even think that your child is going to scroll, be right there to prompt them and fade your prompts as quickly as possible. 

00:44:00
Sign Guidelines 

00:44:00
CHERISH Now let's talk about some guidelines and other information that's very important to know when teaching sign language. The first of these we've already discussed to some degree. 

00:44:15
Say the name of the item at least three times with every mand. 

00:44:15
CHERISH You always want to say the name of the item at least three times with every mand. Ultimately, we want our children to talk. This is why it's so important that they frequently hear what the word is supposed to sound like. You also want to make sure you say the name of the item while they already have it and they are enjoying it. This helps us gain even more of the effects of automatic reinforcement. 

00:44:40
Say the word the way you want your child to say the word. 

00:44:40
CHERISH When you are saying the name of the item, make sure you say the word to your child the way you ultimately want your child to say the word to you. Avoid over emphasizing certain parts of the word. For example, the child might be saying canny, and we want them to say candy. So, we overemphasize the D sound, and we prompt candy. If you do this, it's likely that when your child starts to speak, they will say candy. This is very difficult to correct. You also want to avoid sing songing words to your learner. When we were saying the word at least three times with every mand, this can feel kind of awkward. So, sometimes to compensate people singsong the words. For example, they might say candy, candy, candy. If you do this, what you are pairing with reinforcement is the singsong version of the word and this is likely how it will sound when the child starts to say it. You may end up with a child that sings at you. So, just say the word the way you want them to say it, pausing about a second or so in between each presentation. For example, you could say, "Candy, Candy, Candy." While you are prompting them. 

00:45:55
Prompt levels change from moment to moment. 

00:45:55
CHERISH Remember that your prompt levels might have to change from moment to moment. Sometimes you will have a child who can walk in the room and sign cookie no problem at all. But five minutes later, they might need a prompt. If this is the case, prompt if they need it and then just try to figure prompts again. When this kind of thing happens, usually it's related to motivation. Watch for this. If your child is manding really well for cookies when you first brought them out, and after they've had a few the mand gets sloppy, chances are good that although they still want to them the motivation is getting weaker. This is usually a good time to switch to something else. You can always come back to the cookies later. 

00:46:35
Use differential reinforcement. 

00:46:35
CHERISH Use differential reinforcement when teaching sign. If your child science independently or requires less prompting than usual, give them more of the item. Nothing reinforces them as much as giving them extra of the item that they are already motivated for. 

00:46:55
Reinforce independence over accuracy. 

00:46:55
CHERISH We talked about this a little bit earlier. Remember to reinforce independence over accuracy in the beginning. So if you are teaching your child to mand fridge candy and his very first independent attempt looks like this, reinforce. Once he's doing this a few times, you can easily start to shape it into this. What is difficult is when you are constantly prompting to make it look perfect, and the child starts to get prompt dependent. We need to differentially reinforce those independent signs even if they aren't perfect in the beginning. 

00:47:30
When teaching the first signs, try to choose signs that do not look alike. 

00:47:30
CHERISH When choosing your first signs to teach, try to choose signs that look different from each other. If the signs look alike, they are what we like to call signs that rhyme. For example candy and apple look-alike. They are both right here by your face with a twist of the wrist. If your child tries to sign candy, they might easily slip into signing apple by accident. If you teach signs that rhyme, you are likely to get scrolling. 

00:48:00
When teaching the first signs, avoid choosing signs from the same motivational category. 

00:48:00
CHERISH Try to avoid teaching signs from the same motivational category. Examples of categories might be all things you eat, all toys with wheels or all toys that go in the bathtub. If your child is going to err, it's usually more likely to happen within the same category. We also may error within the same category. We might walk into a restaurant and say, "I'll have a hamburger. Oh no, wait, I'll have a cheeseburger." But, we wouldn't walk into that same restaurant and say, "I'll have a shoe. Oh wait, no, I meant a cheeseburger." These are very different categories altogether. If you have to teach all food items because this is all that motivates your child, it's okay. Just be prepared with the error correction procedure. And above all, make sure you are using errorless teaching. This means preventing errors before they can occur. 

00:48:55
If your child does weak motor imitation, teach between 3 and 5 signs at one time. 

00:48:55
CHERISH When you first start teaching sign language, the number of targets you choose really depends on your child's motor imitation ability. If your child has really weak motor imitation or maybe even no motor imitation skills at all, avoid teaching just one sign it is time. If you do, it's likely that that child will use the one sign for everything they want. On the same note, if the motor imitation is weak, we don't want to teach them too many signs because we might set them up for failure if we do. We want to the learner to be successful. We recommended teaching anywhere between 3 to 5 signs at a time for these children. 

00:49:35
Children can learn to sign even if they cannot imitate. 

00:49:35
CHERISH Let's now clear up a common misconception. You do not have to teach a motor imitation separately prior to teaching your child to mand using sign language. Many people think that you do. However, if you analyze the procedure we recommended for teaching sign, you'll see that you're actually teaching your child to imitate at the exact same time you're teaching them to ask for things. With our procedure, we first model the sign. Then we prompt the child's hands. And then we deliver the reinforcement. This is exactly how you teach motor imitation. However, when teaching the mand, the reinforcer is specific to the motivation. This is the best type of reinforcement that there is. Our children learn to imitate while they are acquiring those mands. 

00:50:25
If your child has good motor imitation teach between 5 and 15 signs. 

00:50:25
CHERISH If your child has fairly good motor imitation ability, meaning that he can imitate some gross motor movements like clapping hands, putting his arms up and maybe even some fine motor movements, you can start teaching at least five signs and maybe even up to 15 signs depending on how good that motor imitation actually is. 

00:50:50
[sil.] 

00:50:50
If your child has excellent motor imitation, you can teach over 15 signs at a time 

00:50:50
CHERISH If your child has excellent motor imitation ability, you can often start teaching with even more than 15 signs at a time. 

00:51:00
What to do when your child wants something you are not currently targeting as a mand with sign. 

00:51:00
CHERISH While you are teaching your target signs, it's likely your child is going to want other items that you are not currently targeting. If your child comes up to you and they want to chip and you're not targeting chip, go ahead and give them a chip if they are allowed to have it. And then simply pair the word chip with the item. If you know the sign, you can show the child what that sign looks like as long as they are not going to think you are prompting them to sign for it. If they are going to take your model as a demand , you don't even want to show them. Otherwise, you accidentally end up teaching 50 or so signs at one time when you really only have a few targets. Don't forget to say the word so that you get those effects of automatic reinforcement. 

00:51:45
Make a sign language dictionary showing all of your child's signs. 

00:51:45
CHERISH We sometimes make a sign language dictionary specific to the child we are teaching. If they have modified versions of signs, we will include what those look like in the book. The important thing is that their book holds all the signs that they know. You can use these for different reasons. These can be used to give to the new teacher for next year so that she can prepare and learn those signs or to the babysitter so she can interact with your child while you were out. Maybe to train the new therapist. Or for grandma, grandpa, mom, dad, whomever. We only do this though if it's necessary. 

00:52:25
Manding Guidelines 

00:52:25
CHERISH Now let's talk about some guidelines to teaching the first mands. 

00:52:35
Manding is Natural Environment Teaching. 

00:52:35
CHERISH The first thing to know is that when you are teaching the mand of repertoire, you are teaching in the natural environment. Remember, that when a child is manding they are asking for the thing that they want. So this is talking about the thing that has value to your child in that moment. So it doesn't matter if you're at the table, on the floor or wherever. It's still natural environment teaching. 

00:52:55
Motivation must be present before prompting the mand. 

00:52:55
CHERISH This next point is a very important one. Make sure your child is motivated before you prompt them to mand. If you prompt your child to mand and they are not motivated for the item, that's actually the opposite of manding. You also want to make sure the motivation is high. So watch for those shifts in volume and latency. 

00:53:20
Practice teaching mands before you teach your child. 

00:53:20
CHERISH Be sure to practice teaching mands before you go in and start doing this with your child. If you don't practice, you are likely to make your mistakes on the child and they might get upset. While you are trying to figure out what you are doing, you might actually be delaying their reinforcement. Practice with other adults or with typically developing children who are more able to tolerate your mistakes. Then come to your child knowing how to teach. 

00:53:45
Teach mands in a variety of locations. 

00:53:45
CHERISH You want to try to teach each mand in different places. If you teach your child to mand for all their favorite things in one room of your home every day and never leave that room, your child will be able to ask for all kinds of things in that room. But some kids, when you leave the room, they won't be able to ask for anything. This happened with a client Holly works with in Bermuda named Michael. When we did his beginning manding, we did all of his teaching in the basement of his home. That's where his therapy room was. Well, his manding came along really well. And he was able to ask for all kinds of things that he wanted. One day, Holly was in their home working with Michael's brother Richard, who is also a child with autism. Well, they were in the living room, and Michael walks upstairs from the basement. He sees a piece of chocolate sitting on the counter. He starts to reach for it, but he can't reach it. Well, they didn't think anything of it and kept working with Richard. Well, Michael keeps reaching and reaching. And finally they hear him start going, "Eh! Eh!" And making all these noises trying to get to his chocolate. But, he can't get it. Suddenly, he throws himself down and has a full-blown tantrum on the kitchen floor. This is a huge red flag because Michael could ask for chocolate when he wanted it. Don't you think it would take a lot less effort just to say chocolate than it would to throw this huge tantrum? That takes a lot of effort. So, Holly went over and grabbed to the chocolate and walked down the stairs to the basement. Of course, Michael followed her. He really wanted that chocolate. So, as soon as they hit the basement floor, Michael said, "Chocolate.", clear as day. This was a signal that there was a huge problem. At that moment they actually put Richard's consult on hold and started to address this manding issue with Michael. They had to set it up so that his teaching occurred in many environments. I know that many people are limited in the space they have to do their teaching. Just be aware of this issue and to do your best to make sure that all people in the child's life are teaching these mands across environments. 

00:55:50
Capture and tries many opportunities each day to teach mands. 

00:55:50
CHERISH Next, be sure to capture and tribes as many opportunities a day as you possibly can to teach this man's. You do not want to sit around and wait for these things to happen. If you just sit around and wait for your child to be motivated, you might get 20 or 30 mands in the whole day. That's not enough. If we want to catch our children up with their typically developing peers, we have to get them talking at least as much is that peer. Most children without delays talk thousands of times per day. Don't we know it? If we want our children to talk many times per day, we have to set those situations up. We have to contrive motivation at least hundreds of times per day. It's not as hard as you might think. Let's say your child enjoys playing with puzzles. You can take out a puzzle, take the puzzle pieces out and lay that puzzle board on the floor with just a few of the pieces. If your child likes puzzles, they'll likely come running over. You've just contrived motivation for your child to put the puzzle pieces in. Another example. You might walk into the room with a bag of their favorite chips, open it and shake it. Now they want those chips. Two seconds ago, they didn't want chips. But now they look up, and they want them. You contrived the motivation. After they eat some chips, now they are likely to be thirsty. Bring up that drink. You just contrived another motivation. We recommend between 3 to 800 mands per day depending on the amount of time you have to teach. The number you target each day will also depend on the strength of that child's motivation. Remember that we prefer quality over quantity. You can get thousands of mands where the child really doesn't care and those aren't as good as just getting hundreds where the child is highly motivated. 

00:57:40
Track the number of mands each day. 

00:57:40
CHERISH Now, since we are targeting so many mands per day, there's really no way to keep track of this in your head. So we recommend using tally counters or this frequency counters to track as you go along. Some people wear them around their neck, other were them on their belts. The way we take frequency data on our mands depends entirely on what the mand target is. If we are teaching beginning mands, we are probably going to be counting prompted and unprompted mands. But, at some point we might change our data and start tracking mands without the item present or mands with more than one word. But, all of this will depend on the level the child. This next guideline may be the most important one. Be a giver, not a taker. 

00:58:30
The a giver and not a taker. 

00:58:30
CHERISH Being a taker would be if I gave a child of the whole bottle of juice and then took it back to get another mand. Being the giver would be giving her a small amount in a cop. Then she has to come back to me to get more. Here's another scenario for you. What some people might to do is put out a bunch of different toys on the floor for their session. They've got the bus over here with all the little people. They have a puzzle here with all the pieces out. And over here they have a bunch of blocks. So now they go in to start their session. The child runs over to the little people on the bus. So, the therapist comes running over. "Oh, you want to play with the little people." They take the bus, dump all the little people in their lap. They give the bus back to the child and start making that child ask for all those little people. This kid is like, "Wait a minute. Things were good before you came along. I had all the little people, and you just took them from me. I'm leaving." So, off he goes running to play with the puzzle that's laying out. He starts putting the pieces in. So, the therapist comes running over. "Oh, now you want to play with the puzzle." And they dump the pieces on their lap, and now they start making the child ask for all those puzzle pieces. This is the same thing again. This kid is not sticking around. Now, he's off to the blocks. You can see in this scenario that the therapist is a taker, not a giver. If someone didn't know any better, they might actually say to you, "This natural environment teaching stuff just doesn't work." But really the problem is that the therapist is killing the value of the items by it being a taker. You can take that same situation, but now you can be a giver. Put the bus on the floor, but only leave out one or two little people. Put the rest of the little people in a bag of pie were only you can get to it. Get your puzzle out and take all the pieces out before your child gets there. Put them in a bag on the shelf, maybe without one or two pieces. And with the blocks, just put out one or two blocks. Now when your child comes in and runs over to the bus and puts in the little people, you can come over and say, "Oh, you want to play with the bus." Because now you have all the little people, and you can have the child ask for them. Here you are a giver of the little people. He couldn't get them without you. Same thing with the puzzle. He runs over and puts in the pieces that are out. And this signals to you that he wants to do that puzzle. You contrived the motivation, so now you can come over with the rest of the pieces. You are a giver. Same thing with the blocks.

Sanitize the environment so that you can control the reinforcers. 

01:00:55
CHERISH This example brings us to our next point which is to sanitize the environment. Now, what we mean by this is that you need to set up the environment strategically so that you are not going to be a taker. Have things set up so that you know what's out and how you can make each activity better when you come over. In the meantime, whatever is not being used, keep it out of reach of that child. Because let's say you have the pirate ship out and there are other things out too, but you're not planning to use them for that session. Well, if a child sees it, they may run over and start playing with it. If the environment isn't sanitized, you will not be able to control your reinforcers during your session. And this is not conducive to teaching. 

01:01:40
Avoid killing the motivation. 

01:01:40
CHERISH Another point is to avoid killing motivation. With some children, if you make them ask for every little thing, that is enough to kill the motivation. Even though this child may want all the little people for the bus, if you make them ask for each one that might just be too many demands for that child. Too much effort is required. You might have to set it up with some children so that when they ask for one thing, they always get another one or two for free. Always be watching that you are not killing the motivation. Sometimes you're not even sure what you're doing that's killing motivation. That can happen. You think you are doing everything by the book, and you might be. But suddenly, your child to previously loved that pirate ship doesn't like it anymore. You might be tempted just to think, "Well, he just changes his mind a lot. He might like it one day and not the next. I guess he's just tired of the pirate ship." But what might be really happening is that the value of the toys are being killed. You may be killing the value of that item. You're not intending to. You don't mean to. But sometimes whatever it is that you're doing with those toys is just too much response effort for your child. It makes it so the toy is not fun anymore. The child may not want to go near them. If that's the case then you think that might've happened, what you can do is give those things for free for a while with no demands at all. Sometimes if you do this over the course of a couple of days, they start to enjoy the toys again. If that happens, then we know it was something we did that killed the value of that item. That's half the battle, just knowing that you killed the value. The second half of the battle is figuring out how you killed it, because however you did it you don't want to do it again. 

01:03:25
Remember to feed your prompts. 

01:03:25
CHERISH Next, try to get the best quality of response with the least amount of prompting. You should always be trying to fade your prompts. If you try to fade too soon, you will know because the child will increase their errors. If this happens, just go back a step and prompt some more. As we mentioned, we prefer errorless teaching. When fading, remember to differentially reinforce. Remember, the less prompting we have to do the more reinforcement we are going to get. Keep in mind if your child needs more prompting than usual or maybe they are making more errors than usual, check to see if this is a motivation issue rather than a prompt fading issue. It may just be that they don't want the item or the activity as much, and you need to move on to another activity. 

01:04:15
Avoid placing unnecessary demands on your child while teaching mands. 

01:04:15
CHERISH When you are teaching mands, don't ask unnecessary questions to your child during the activity. This includes asking them to label things, give you items or even suggesting they play with their toys a certain way. Sometimes we don't even realize we are placing these demands on her child. But even just saying, "Hey, Joey, why don't you put your car on the ramp?" That's a demand to Joey, and it might actually kill the value of that car. If you are teaching Joey, certainly your intention wasn't to kill the value of the car, but these types of things are all demands that can kill the value of items that you are teaching them to ask for. So, prioritize the skills you are trying to teach. And remember, if the items aren't valuable, you can't teach a mand. 

01:05:05
When teaching the first mands, avoid teaching: "yes," "no," "more," "help," "please," "give me" and "eat," or anything else that can turn into a generalized mand for many things. 

01:05:05
CHERISH When you are teaching the first mands, we recommend that you avoid teaching yes, no, more, help, please, give me and even eat. These can become generalized mands for everything. Your child might walk up to you and mand more. Well, more what? It just turns into a generalized mand for everything. Or they might come up to you and just say, "Yes." Well, yes what? You still don't know what it is that they want unless the item is present. They are just basically saying to you, "I want something. Figure out what it is." The same thing can happen with eat. They walk in the kitchen. They mand eat. Well, at least you know they want food. But you still don't know what kind of food. It's just too general. We recommend teaching the individual food names instead. Cookie, chicken, apples. And then when they mand, you will know exactly what they want. You can also later teach these mands across other functions such as intra-verbals, syntax a lot more easily. 

01:06:10
When teaching the first mands, avoid teaching mands for the removal of something aversive. 

01:06:10
CHERISH In the beginning, you also want to avoid teaching mands for break, all done, move, bye-bye, leave, etc. In order to prompt him of mand, the motivation has to be present. When we are teaching our early learners, we don't want to contrive motivation for them to want us to leave them alone. We want them to want us to be near them and to give them things. If they are motivated for us to leave them alone, give them a break or goal way, we won't be as successful in teaching them to ask for things. Also, talking under the control of that function doesn't lead to conversation. We want our children to learn that when they talk good things happen and they get things. We don't want them to only learn that when they talk, bad things go way. 

01:07:00
When teaching the first mands, avoid teaching toilet." 

01:07:00
CHERISH You also want to avoid teaching potty or toilet as a first mand. Remember, in order to prompt that mand, the child has to be motivated. We find that even typically developing kids don't always want to go potty even when they need to. 

01:07:20
If necessary, keep number of mand targets low to maintain motivation. 

01:07:20
CHERISH As you know, when we teach the first mands, we choose those things that are child cares the most about. These are the items that you would consider to be their favorite things. The number of targets you choose depends on their ability to imitate you, either vocally or with sign. For those children with excellent vocalizations and signers with superb motor imitation, you can usually start teaching mands for all things the child likes as long as you don't kill the motivation. For those children who have fragile motivation, we might limit the number of items we are teaching as mands to help keep us from killing their motivation. So it's possible that less than 10 items will be targeted at a time regardless of the child's vocal or motor imitation ability in order that the motivation be maintained. When any of those specific targets are mastered, you just add new targets right away. This might ensure that the child continues to progress. 

01:08:20
Consistency across therapists is important. 

01:08:20
CHERISH After you've determined which target you are teaching, next you want to make sure all therapists and teachers are consistent in their teaching methods. Sometimes you'll have within a program some really ambitious people who want to move on to another procedure. For example, you might be working on echo manding only, and that's what the team is supposed to be doing. But, you might have one therapist who starts using the echo to mand or mimetic to mand transfer. Or another that might think they are ready to feed to the motivation. You cannot have people just arbitrarily making decisions. Everyone needs to be consistent. Another important note to make right here is to make sure everyone is calling things by the same name. We had a situation like this happen at a consult. I went into a home for the first time. I talk to them all how to run the manding sessions. During this consult the child learned to ask for these 10 things, just in the time I was there. When I came back three months later and asked them what he could ask for, he could still only ask for 10 things. Guess what, they were the same 10 things we taught him the last time I was there. Of course, the first thing I thought was they must not be teaching correctly or else he would've learned more mands. So, I asked everyone to spend some time teaching him mands so I could observe their procedures. Well, everyone did a really good job with the procedures. Based just on that, he should've been learning mands. So I was really baffled. So I pulled down a pirate ship that this child liked to play with and that they had all been working on manding with. In a last attempt to figure out this problem I asked the team, "What are you calling this toy?" And one therapist said, "Pirate ship." Another one said, "Boat" and the third one said, "Ship." Then I held up a sword, and asked again, "What are you calling this?". I heard knife and I heard sword. Then I held up the barrel that you find on the pirate ships, and I asked them, "Well, what are you calling this?" I heard barrel, beer barrel and beer, because that third girl thought the beer was easier to say than barrel. Now, I did this with toy after toy and found that they were all calling things by different names. One therapist was consistently teaching two words mands. Another therapist was making up names that she thought were easier for the child to say. And the third therapist was always teaching one word that was the actual name of the item. This child did not learn anything as a result. When we fixed this problem, he started to learn. It just goes to show how subtle the problem could be that will prevent mands for being acquired. 

01:11:00
Use a variety of activities for each target mand. 

01:11:00
CHERISH Try to use a variety of activities that involve your target mand. For example, if your child is learning to mand ball, to put it to down a ball ramp, try to think of other activities you can do with the ball so that you are not always just ringing out that the ball ramp. You might have an activity where you roll the ball. You might have a big ball that they can bounce on. Or, you could get a bat and have them hit the ball if they enjoy it. Maybe this is a child that likes to knock things down. If that's the case, I could stack some blocks and have them kick a ball tonight was down. Now we have four activities were they can mand for ball. Hey, maybe this child likes water. You could have them throw the ball into water to see it splash. That makes five activities. Now you get an idea how you are actually going to be able to get those hundreds of mands each day that we recommend. You have to get creative, and it does take planning time. But, this is what we want to do. 

01:11:55
Tracker the mand activities used to prevent satiation. 

01:11:55
CHERISH When you are teaching your target mands across a variety of activities, it's often necessary to create a date last played with data sheet so that you can keep track of what your child has played with already that week. Tracking what they have played with already should allow you to know how to continually rotate through those activities that the child hasn't seen for a while. This helps to prevent satiation, because you can control how frequently the child gets each activity. For example, sometimes we set up a child's program so that each activity can only be done once maybe every three days. So, if you play with those balls going down that ramp on Monday, you wouldn't be allowed to do that that variation of the activity again until a least Thursday. This helps to keep the motivation high for the different activities. 

01:12:50
Plan ahead. 

01:12:50
CHERISH Preventing satiation of an activity isn't the only thing you can do to help keep that motivation high. Planning ahead within your session is also very important. It's, common that a therapist will be teaching in the natural environment and would run a full manding session for just one activity, such as the balls going down the ramp. When the child shows that they are no longer interested in playing with that activity, sometimes the therapist will be uncertain of what to do next and will take that time to go and get a new activity. In the time that's lapsed between the end of that ball ramp activity and the beginning of the next one, the child is often off stimming or doing something else. If time lapses like this, you lose momentum in your session. Is the momentum you had in the first activity to your advantage. Think of at least two or three activities to play with before you start so that the point where the child is starting to get say satiated on the first activity, you can immediately bring out the next one. See if you can morph from one activity straight into the next. If you can, you will maintain momentum and keep the motivation strong, and you're likely to get more teaching opportunities as a result. When we were thinking of all the activities we will play with during a session, it's often helpful to create a lesson plan. Each lesson plan can consist of several different activities and can list all the possible mands that you might try to get when conducting each activity. 

01:14:15
Restrict free access to reinforcers when the children are not being taught. 

01:14:15
CHERISH You can have the best activities and lesson plans in the world, and if you can't prevent your child from getting free access to reinforcers when not being taught, it can still be very difficult to keep the motivation strong enough to keep teach those mands. Think about it. If you allow free access to the reinforcers when they are not in a session, why would they work for them during a session? For example, if someone just gave you money all the time, would you really work hard for it? No. Not unless you enjoyed the work. Now, we do understand that parents need to be able to give their children some reinforcers, like movies or other things, during non-therapy time just to be able to get things done around the house. For this, what we recommend is that you still restrict the best reinforcers for therapy and just allow the less preferred ones for free time. Sometimes we will even recommend that the therapist actually take the best reinforcers with them when they leave. This may be necessary, for example if you have a child who is amazing at finding anything you've hidden, including the key to the door that leads to the restricted toys. Another benefit to this, besides preventing the child from getting constant access, is that the child is really happy when that therapist comes back.
