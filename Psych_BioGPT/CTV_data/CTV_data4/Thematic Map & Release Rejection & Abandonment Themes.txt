DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY So we are now filming, you know, I just want to just confirm, uh… Sebastian, that you're totally okay with me filming this with the camera and down you can see that we're being captured right now. And we're gonna talk about feelings and I know that thing that we have talked about is attachment and that you've given me a very, very specific uh… memory. 

00:00:35
SEBASTIAN Yeah. 

00:00:40
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY But, it, it actually illustrates the, the theme itself and for you it's about being uh… rejected or kicked out and somehow, these kinds of thoughts come to your mind, when it comes to your mind they can be very powerful. You are given this sentence, you're afraid being kicked out, abandoned or afraid of abandoned that we're being forced to leave. And because there's a lot of historical Trauma that goes along with that. You know, this becomes a theme. So a lots of things can happen in your life which give you kind of what we would call as evidence. 

00:01:15
SEBASTIAN Yeah. 

00:01:15
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY That this theme is happening once again and you're telling me that even today. You could see that uh… things that are happening in your personal life with your wife… 

00:01:25
SEBASTIAN Yeah. 

00:01:25
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY …reignite that same thought. So it's kind of like, what I would call a story line. 

00:01:30
SEBASTIAN Yeah. 

00:01:30
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY So we know the story line like that can be a powerful motivator in your life and what we want to be able to do is focus on this very precisely using an exercise could be called the Thematic Map And Release. 

00:01:40
SEBASTIAN Okay. 

00:01:45
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Now, I wanna walk you through a few of the steps before we even start and I know you're, you've already said that you're giving us permission to film this, this is going to go to a professional audience that it will be also posted online as well as they watching you and you are okay with that. 

00:01:55
SEBASTIAN yeah, I'm okay with that. Yes. 

00:01:55
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Excellent! Okay, that's great. So what, we're gonna to do is umm… look at uh… what happens, when we have a theme like this is it almost gets caught. Not only in our bodies but our minds and it drives everything. It drives all over interactions, it drives how we feel about certain situations that undermine our ability to actually deal with a situation that ignites that theme. 

00:02:20
SEBASTIAN Okay. 

00:02:20
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY This is a release exercise. It's also focusing exercise and we're going to go through a number of different points in which you're gonna focus. now, what we do is, we're actually trying to intentionally draw the theme up, so you can reflect on it and actually sit and be more of an observer to that storyline. See, what happens is usually when you have a storyline that's that powerful is, you bring it up and then you just feel upset and frozen or overwhelmed or whenever you go to places, angry or confused whatever it is. In this situation, we, we focus on it. You allow what ever comes to the surface to surface and you'll become kind of a compassionate observer of that storyline. No judgment, no suppression. We go through that, we focus on it. I'll have you think about your thoughts, emotions and body sensations that any of the thoughts that might along with it. 

00:03:20
SEBASTIAN Okay. 

00:03:20
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY And then I'm gonna how you do the release portion. Now, think about this. We've all been to some place where there's a sandy beach and you know what it feels like to have a hand full of warm sand. 

00:03:30
SEBASTIAN Yeah. 

00:03:30
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY You know that feeling? You know, how Nice that is? 

00:03:30
SEBASTIAN Yeah. 

00:03:30
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY And then, you also know that feeling of having that sand's feeling through your finger, how nice that feels? 

00:03:35
SEBASTIAN Yeah. 

00:03:35
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY You just close your eyes for a minute and just imagine yourself doing that and tell me when you have that. 

00:03:40
SEBASTIAN I do. 

00:03:45
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Well, okay. So, you can picture the feeling of the movies that goes along with that. 

00:03:50
SEBASTIAN Yeah. 

00:03:50
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Now, the next piece of release is, I want you to imagine inside of yourself that you're an empty vessel filling with sand from the top of your head. And sand fills in like an hourglass slowly filling up, going into the front and back of your face, down here neck into your shoulders, down your arms into the core of body, down your legs, passed your shins and calves into your feet. Now, when it gets to the tips of toes and the tips of your fingers, I want you to actually picture that the sand is being released. Just fading out and away from you. And tell me, when you have that feeling. 

00:04:30
SEBASTIAN I do. 

00:04:30
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Good, okay. Now, bring your awareness back into the room. We're gonna start again. 

00:04:35
SEBASTIAN With my eyes close? 

00:04:35
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Umm… No, I mean, have your focus outside right for now. Thank you, for asking that. Yeah. So, what we're gonna do is, we're gonna start with the theme. 

00:04:45
SEBASTIAN Okay. 

00:04:45
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY That, you're gonna be kicked out abandoned threatened, look abandonment or forced to leave. Right? That's the big theme for you. 

00:04:55
SEBASTIAN Yeah. 

00:04:55
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Right? I mean, actually have you move your chair just a couple of inches forward. 

00:05:00
SEBASTIAN Forward? 

00:05:00
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Closer, yeah, exactly, 'cause I'm gonna have you, uh… track where I point the cap of the pen. 

00:05:05
SEBASTIAN Okay. 

00:05:05
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Okay? And all I want you to do, when you focus on the cap of the pen, it's hold your attention there. 

00:05:15
SEBASTIAN Okay. 

00:05:15
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY As you hold your attention, I'm gonna ask you to recall that theme of being kicked out, abandoned or threatened of abandonment or being forced to leave. You told me, when you're here at the last time that it felt pretty bad on scale one to ten like a seven, right? 

00:05:30
SEBASTIAN Yeah… yeah. 

00:05:35
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY So, even in eight now. 

00:05:35
SEBASTIAN Oh, yeah. 

00:05:35
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Okay, good. 

00:05:35
SEBASTIAN When you think about it. 

00:05:40
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Okay, so now, I'm gonna have you just, so might hold back focus point and let everything that goes along with that come to the surface as best as it can. Just notice being a compassionate observer of that storyline. Normally, learning and being open to every need to know about that. And then close your eyes. And then allow whatever thoughts, emotions or body sensations that prolong with outwards surface, silently just being an observer. Keeping your eyes closed, help me to understand, what you're aware of, as you focus on that theme? What thoughts, emotions of body sensation go along with that? 

00:06:30
SEBASTIAN Uh… It's always uh… it's, you know, kind of pressure, surprise, always there… uh… let's say it's hard to swallow, but it's just such a shy. And then, just uh… some sensation that, whatever, down here you kept right, someway it's like, if you've heard a gunshot, right. I have to hear the gunshot. You know, I then hear is, the gunshot, right? But you know, you hear everything else in the room, you know, everything else. And this is the same feel, right, you suddenly vary like I have to show numbers focusing on the uh… the words and try to make sense out of it so… and then you trying to process the, the request itself, the… the, that uh… what do you mean by this? I'm just… get cold, but am I regaining cold? Right, if you know, someone get as if you are freezing. And uh… yeah, just… you know, very thirsty, a lot thirsty but you get a dry mouth, you get older, you know, all the symptoms are uh… you know, make a very uh… stressful of uh… 

00:07:55
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Yeah, absolutely, so now I'm gonna have you do is just notice, all of that and what you do harness your imagination, use your mind to your harness that powerful imagination. Open up your palms and let them rest on your lap. And I want you to picture that you've got two large warm, handy dry handful of sand and the sensation of the warmth, moves deeply into the centre of the palms of your hands and it feels soothing, as it moves up your arms and into shoulders. I want you to get the sensation of that warm being very comforting in the center of the palms of your hands. I want you to get the sensation of the grains of sand that's filling through your slightly part of, just down of the room, keenly sensation of the release. Just allow yourself to do that. And then, focusing inside of yourself again using your mind to harness to your imagination, picturing that you're an empty vessel, filling with sand from the top of your head, the sands fills you, filling in slowly moving into the front and back of the face down your neck into shoulders, down your arms, into the core of your body, down to your legs, through tips of the toes and tips of the finger tips, just release it. I want you just allow yourself to picture out for the moment. Now, I want you to get the sensation of all those thoughts, the emotions and body sensations of feeling being cold, sensation of surprise, pressure, words being shock. But all of that attached to the grains of sand, which are carried down and away swelling out to the tips of the toes and finger tips and just allow yourself to have that sensation. You still every need to do, air witness being compassionate observer to that storyline that you moves. 

00:10:25
[sil.] 

00:10:35

00:11:15
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Went to the original Trauma. 

00:11:20
SEBASTIAN We went to the original Trauma, right? And I mean, in the room and I can, I can, I already it like felt like but my hands getting cold, and I felt my… my shoulder are getting tense that was prime out, you know, and then now I can feel like, you know, my hands are warming, I feel like pants are warming. Yeah, I can feel the sensation of this room. I can feel that, the chairs are comfortable, you know that the, all the aspects of this room as I supposed to the aspects of that like policy for split like second, I was gone there. 

00:11:50
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Right, because that, that's like the, the old room, making itself known in present moment with the real day at to day to day events, right?

00:12:05
SEBASTIAN Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:12:05
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY We're gonna go on to the next point and that's just down and to the left and I want you to hold that focused point and I want to go back to the original theme of being kicked out, abandoned or threats of abandonment, being forced to leave and understanding that, that's the theme that we're going to focus on the line whatever faults, emotions, our body sensation to certain. Whatever they are, just bearing witness being a compassionate witness to that storyline. All we now focused point. Learning, what ever you need to learn from it and closing your eyes continuing hold that focused point. Being aware of thoughts, emotions, body sensations, like whatever comes to the surface to surface, just focusing inside yourself silently, feeling compassionate witness to this learning what you to like. And then how being understands about sure that you're aware of keeping your eyes closed. You can learn to let it all come to the surface and just help me to understand what thoughts, emotions and body sensation through your words now. 

00:13:25
SEBASTIAN Almost cold. Might on that feeling. In cold as if its now just letting about it and it's hard to describe but it's looking at I did from a top of this stairs that suppose to be. So instead of being me I'm kind like the, I can still, I'm close enough that uh… get a sense of Uh… You know, when you feel the tension through individual, started more of a tension in the room, might I'm not, I don't feel a cold, right? And I'm kinda looking at it as if… yeah, as if I was in the room. Let's think that people argue, the people seeking your feel attention in the room and you try to make sense. Uh… what's going on, it suppose to, but still five second we go where? You know, being done to me. So bring back into that moments from now on it's still a you know, I still feel that a little bit attention in a sense that, you know, and you keep hearing what they say people prinking on street to get attention but I'm not you know, a lot attention but I earlier… 

00:14:40

00:14:45
SEBASTIAN Umm… well, initially like you know, I was more hear it now as more uh… try to understand, right? Like why, not… I'm not, not sympathetic but end of that everyone sense I'm trying to do the situation more than feeling that situation now perusing just about moment right so… 

00:15:15
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY What else does you feel tension in your body, what other body sensations are you aware of? 

00:15:20
SEBASTIAN Well, it's like it's even on to my eyes closed like I was on a tendency to observe, you know, like when your, your eyes are turning back and forth, I can feel… and I can still feel the sensation of you know, when your eyes are scanning the room or they turning back and forth, they're like around the room, that's how that sensation. Whatever I don't feel as cold as I did initially when you just telling your story and then I saw the tension in my neck, right? Like this nothing that's, that's how did they have it, it's situation comes to tense I always, you know, like that… as if you're not raise your hand, we're right up here and ready to fight nothing but it otherwise it's like I don't like they still to now I feel the chair, when it still feels my pants. As that proves to you honestly previous time that not even you know, even close. Away from the room. 

00:16:15
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Now I want you to again harness, your imagination through mind, uh… can you focus inside of yourself. And I want you to picture you got two large warmed heavy dry handful of sand. The sensation of the warmth in the palms of your hands verse into your hands up through your arms and into your shoulders, giving the sensation of believe and the release. That's the grains of sands fill between your slightly parted fingers down on away from you. Just give me a sensation of release. You just Picture that as best as you can. Picture inside of yourself, you're an empty vessel, filling up with sand from the top of your head, sands fills into the core of the body, down your arms and leg. Through that the tips of your toes and finger tips. When the grains of sand spill down on the way from out tips of the toes and finger tips. Just release it. You picture of whatever thoughts, emotions, body sensations, are no longer useful to you. Tension in your neck, sensation of cold whatever suits it. Now all of that to attach to the grains of sand and now that be carried down on the legs filling out the tips of the toes and finger tips express as you can. In this moment observing that. 

00:17:50
[sil.] 

00:18:10
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Remember your awareness back into the room. Just notice in whatever it is you notice. What are you aware of right now? How do you feel?

Into just be able to go back to that situation made me inside my call. I kinda just freezing. Now I can feel like I have a forget that I just in this room I'm kind alone. 

00:18:45
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY So Even I have you go back, I keep having you go back to that theme and now you notice that you can go in and out of there. And it doesn't, it's not a jar, right? 

00:18:55
SEBASTIAN Yeah! 

00:18:55
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Okay, I'm gonna have you look down and to the right, unless you do, I want you do, hold that focus point. Hold the focus point and go back to the original theme of being abandoned, being afraid of being rejected, your own awareness of the threat of being kicked out, being forced to leave. But that come to the surface again just bearing witness, being a compassionate observer of that storyline, knowing whatever thoughts, emotions and body sensations go along with that. Closing your eyes, focusing inside of yourself and allowing all that come to the surface. Learning whatever you need to learn from that story. That's, that has lowered itself into your life so powerful. 

00:19:45
[sil.] 

00:19:50
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY And how could I understand, Sebastian, what you're aware of, what false emotions and body sensations go along with that now? 

00:20:00
[sil.] 

00:20:05
SEBASTIAN well, it's gonna interest enough now, cold, was if I just look right now it's just if I have to uh… physically walk towards the situation, I mean, it's, I know, it's, it's seems to metaphoric, but uh… so right now I'm looking for both I haven't focused on the way we did it, since it, but I'm having a tough time actually finding this situation, you know, uh… in my mind, and so now I have to, it's if I'm trying to own piece of you know, when you have somebody said, you remember I'm back to the story I'm trying to piece the, the situation. Umm… now uh… we went five minutes I could have tell only to you words fro being and watch the counseling right now of as if I can't hear it, right, I can't, I really just looking at it, I'm trying to make, trying hear and now it's, it's like kind of mean, I don't really understand what you're doing. 

00:21:20
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY What emotions are you aware of now? 

00:21:20
SEBASTIAN Well, it's actually my neck is stiff, this is… my shoulders right, like I just, and I'm still warm up side, I can feel the warm and now I can even hear you, attention in the move. Like which is like I could hear really well. And then uh… even with my eyes close this, this is not like I go back, you know, two step to the original first story that, with my eyes closing it, it surely dark. Now it's extreme little, it's more bright. And then it's just this you know, you have, yeah, but I can't, the story is there, I know I remember situation I can't please it well. 

00:22:15
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Okay, So, I should have harness your imagination again using your mind focusing inside of yourself opening up your hands, letting them rest. And allowing yourself to have this sensation of two large warm heavy hand fulls of sand, the warmth penetrates into the center of the palms of your hand, moving your palms that into your shoulder, give up your neck giving you a sensation of further release. And the relaxation. The grains of sands spill through your slightly cut out fingers down in away from you just releasing by let go. Imagine inside of yourself you are an empty vessel filling with sand from the top of your head. The sand spills in, filling up the core of the body. Moving down your arms and legs through the tips of the toes and fingertips. And release it. At the tips of the toes and finger tips, you just slowly let go. Picture inside of yourself, whatever emotions that still remain that are no longer useful to you. Whatever body sensations still remain that are no longer useful to you, both thoughts, let them attach to the grains of sand and they carried away. Just noticing of best as you can. As you release the story line. What ever you need to do in this moment to let that happened for you. 

00:24:00
[sil.] 

00:24:15
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Now you bring your awareness back into the room, open your eyes, what do you right now and what you notice? 

00:24:25
SEBASTIAN It's… I'm just, uh… it's just like I can hear what, what's going on like next door, I can hear… enormous voice in your (inaudible ), you know, even know if it's fine, even knowing I'm doing this intra section today, I think it even created attention. 

00:24:50
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY You were tensed kinda that you knew that already. Yeah, we're working on this. Yeah. 

00:24:50
SEBASTIAN That's right. I was tensed… 

00:24:50
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY This is like the worst part, This is like the… the core of so much of what we struggled with. So the fact that we were gonna focus on this piece, it makes the sense that you came in anticipating in a proper way, now you're surprised that how you feel. 

00:25:05
SEBASTIAN Yeah, yeah. I'm surprised like a just a little things that I know as right are usually like, like you know, some thing very, but he is on your cabinet, had (inaudible ) fight and honestly and I came in there was as if the thing this was like, you know, just very warm right? 

00:25:30
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY That's kind of a dissociates itself that we had been talking about uh… a while ago, and now it came back up with this theme. But now we're working through it, right? 

00:25:40
SEBASTIAN Tensions I thought thinking about trying to creates that. 

00:25:45
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Yeah, So this is hopefully got the piece that will give you relief now. I want you to look up and to the right and as you do, I want you to hold that point. To hold that focus point, go back to the theme again abandoned, forced to leave. That everything that still attached to that, come to the surface be an observer of that story line. Just know, Knowing whatever you need to know, bearing whatever you need to learn about that. Holding that focus point and closing your eyes. And again we coming aware of false emotions and body sensations. Being a compassionate observer, anything that you need to still learn about that. 

00:26:30
[sil.] 

00:26:35
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY And then help me to understand what you're aware of and she holds focus point on that theme. 

00:26:40
[sil.] 

00:26:45
SEBASTIAN Well. It's hard to go back, you know, it's coming at the point. This isn't forcing uh… I mean, it's like that, it's too black I don't uh… it's isn't for once in the room, all right, so, you know, if I ask you assist in a scenario like this. Here in the room and thanks to you. I mean, tough time paring, going back to the story. 

00:27:10
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY What do you aware of in terms of your body sensations? 

00:27:15
SEBASTIAN Well, so I was tense, right? And my hands and still warm, still I'm more of like (inaudible ) sense that. Uh… I'm sitting on a beach now, that how feeling. I'm playing with so much sand. No, what you know the feeling while you're and you're now. That leaves your, and I'm on a vacation, you don't feel, you can think about work, but you don't feel same. So that seems, you know, you're okay. I can, I'm trying to think about the situation, but I'm more just felt about it and few, I'm, I'm trying to force the issue more, but that I was probably, you know, 5 minutes ago, 10 minutes ago. And so it's still like, you know, it's felt like now I feel like warm, really feel sorry for observers. Like sometimes you see, as if you know, you see somebody crying on a subway and we don't know what the story, we don't why they are crying, but you get that feeling that, that crying must me sad, you know, like kinda personal attitude, but it's okay. It's that I'm the observing from, you know, the moment for, you know, I'm starting that's now I'm looking back uh… from we're sorry for myself, and that like, then that feeling that I told you, which was… the tension of that. 

00:28:50
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Once you get green, you should mine, the punisher, imagination, open up your hands, let them rest slightly on you for a while. You picture to warm happy hand full of sand. Sand spills where you slightly part of the fingers, just release them and the sensation of warmth penetrates deeply into the center of the palms of your hands moving up your arms and into your shoulders and neck, giving your sensation a comfort and then release. Again using your mind to furnish imagination, picture that inside of yourself, you're an empty vessel, filling with sand from the top of your head to sense, fill it's slowly moving down to the core of the body, down your arms and legs, where does tips of the toes and finger tips filling out, down in a way. Imagine whatever thoughts, emotions or body sensations that still exists that are no longer useful to you. Attached to the grains of the sand, which carried them down away, spilling out to the tips and toes and finger tips and just you think, your mind to help you with that as best as you can. Bearing witness. Allowing yourself to release as much as you can at this moment, even one. 

00:30:20
[sil.] 

00:30:40
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Remembering your awareness back into the room, just notice what you're aware of now. 

00:30:45
SEBASTIAN Well, I can hear with that, now I hear the conversation next door. It just, it just, pretty good relax now, like I'm not taking on that. 

00:30:50
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Okay.

Open your fingers and going back to the imagery of the grains of sands, two large heavy handfuls of sand, the sand is spilling through your slightly parted fingers, the sensation of the warmth moving into the centre of the palms of your hands, moving up your arms into your shoulders. Giving your sensation of release, pictures, inside of yourself you're an empty vessel. The grains of sands spilling from the top, moving to the core of the body down your arms and legs, through to the tips of the toes and finger tips. Just releasing. And as best you can gain, allow what ever is left of that theme. What ever thoughts, emotions, your body sensation, whatever it is? It's still no longer useful to you, allow that to touch to the grains of sand will be carried away, its spilling out tips of your toes and finger tips and just do that now as fast as you can.

00:38:15
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Maybe yourself to go back into your own body, in your own experience, in your own internal focus. And just allow yourself to know and to notice if there is anything left in that storyline that being kicked out, being abandoned that, threat of abandoned, being forced to leave and ask yourself is there anything else there that you need to see (inaudible ). Thoughts, emotions and body sensations. 

00:38:50
SEBASTIAN It sounds like a… I really feel, it's uh… now I drive on a highway, we pick a point there, actually it kinda crowd somewhere in the fields something or two cows or something like that… maybe you… you want the, the blew away and I came to see less details and it's kinda that feeling that have now. And bring it back I can still see, you know, where the outlines of the body is and uh… just push earlier window, who was nearly did there and talk like I could hold remain (inaudible ) and warm chips of pains to our… now it's more like it see and that kind of bodies and I just, just I can make the land glitch right through that, I have a sensation it's just uh… now I just uh… illusion about kind a that thing. 

00:40:05
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY I want you to go back, and you using your imagination of bring up your hand while when we resting now. Again the sensation two large one heavy hand full of sand. Sensation of warmth moves into the centre of the palms of your hands, up your arms into your shoulders, up your neck. Give me your sensation of relief and release, the sensations comforting to you, you should feel the grains of sands slipping through your slightly parted your fingers, down on the leg just release them. Picture that you're an empty vessel filling with sand from your top of your head, sands spills in slowly moves into the core of the body, down your arms and leg. Releasing through the tips of your toes and finger tips. And if there's anything else there's still no linger useful to you. Allow it to touch to the grains of sand and be carried away this final time. Allow yourself to do that as best as you can in this moment, just using your imagination. 

00:41:25
[sil.] 

00:41:45
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Now opening your eyes, bringing your awareness back into the room, what do you notice now? 

00:41:50
[sil.] 

00:41:55
SEBASTIAN Just… it's just uh… living room itself, a lot brighter, still, like even though, I'm just uh… pretty work that, I mean, that now this is setback from the, the point itself, right itself up and then moving and the sensation. Like now I hear next door voice though since constant as suppose to it enters, making it cool, I think so that part of. If I was thinking about, if I think about the situation that… like it's…. if the golf course, I can hear the noise where I look uh… through out now, I can hear the noise and problem itself is more just thought, right? 

00:42:45
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Yes, your thought. 

00:42:45
SEBASTIAN Same way when I think about picking groceries, sorry I mean, the voices back, you know, they're gonna in built, it's, its like kinda… 

00:42:50
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Now that's a powerful system. Now look straight ahead, with a much unfocused gaze. And you know, just kinda like your eyes are lazy and there's nothing much going on. And I just want you to just for a moment go back to the original starting point of that theme, you gonna be kicked out, abandoned of threats of abandonment or force to release and I want you to ask yourself on that same scale of one to ten. Where one is now a lot of disturbing and ten is worse feelings of distraction of just feel awful. How ignite about is that theme Right now? 

00:43:30
SEBASTIAN Not much. 

00:43:30
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Give me the number. 

00:43:35
SEBASTIAN Two. 

00:43:35
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Two. Now, I want you to have a take away, what new realization are you bringing with you? Are you gonna be able to leave this room with today? 

00:43:45
[sil.] 

00:43:50
SEBASTIAN No, it's so long ago. I think, its only thing I need picked up right? So long ago. You know, often its… my life is mystery in the sky. You know, if you… sometimes, we make decisions I hope, how can I describe it? We make the decisions in the moment, right? You know, sometimes, you're, I know you're driving, you know, in your left because maybe it's the shortcut right? We make the decision at the moment, based on the situation. I think, umm… I'm holding on to, momentary decision that was made 30 years ago, based on you know, an inability to uh… find a different solution, right? Make a decision that, just like I make decision till today, right? Consequences, right or wrong, but it's the decision to make, he can never really predict the consequences. I'm holding on to… and I'm just strange enough now and I'm don't feel it anymore. And it's okay, I'm like there is a moment that has to go through the other side in life say, I mean, how few like holding it on now. It seems, she even say to me say, all right, I can no longer like that. Like I just, I go, why am I still, why am I still stuck on this thing right? It's who cares, right? Like I there's a… there's that… 

00:45:20
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY That moment doesn't have to impact you anymore, today that theme that I believe that you could have been abandoned, kicked out. It doesn't have to direct, how you see the world see the world anymore. 

00:45:30
SEBASTIAN I was almost, almost want to live, it's a laugh right? Because I was saying, it'll be complicated to kick me out now, right? 

00:45:40
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Yes, the panting come really, yeah. 

00:45:40
SEBASTIAN You know, I don't shut a gym bag full of clothes right? Not… I just and that's like I got one point I was telling, I was saying actually how silly it is like to, to think of the, all right, it could be done instantly, right? I think, that is… well I'm kind of going to infusing us focusing all that it was, you know, when you are you know, 15 and you got a handful of, you know, goods it goes out easy, it since the day we frightened, our day it's, you know, welcome aboard, it seems it (inaudible ) is there a lot more property to the… I think you know, not luck, you know, and, and it's… 

00:46:15
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY But you, you also an adult, you've resources, you're not this 15-year-old child, who is left to his own dialysis, right? And that's never gonna happen again. 

00:46:25
SEBASTIAN And it's also diorite and it's all like uh… well, I can't another job or, or other place to live, right? It since… So there's a moment where I'm, like time was one of lack for myself, right? For… 

00:46:40
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Wow, you ever think you'd saying all this? 

00:46:45
SEBASTIAN No, no, no. I mean, it's funny because I go back to that as soon as you brought the story obviously I couldn't, I have trouble breathing right. 

00:46:50
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Right. That was like, that was 40 minutes ago. 

00:46:55
SEBASTIAN Yeah, in that situation, I mean I can… I was in that room, I could remember the call of the trumpet and I know that chocking feeling that you get, you know, and you, uh… for me it's always a chock down here that you got trouble solving, you got trouble breathing. 

00:47:10
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY But now, when I, when I go back to this theme, you gonna be kicked out, abandoned or there's a threat of abandonment, and you forced to leave. 

00:47:20
SEBASTIAN I'm laughing, I'm, I'm kinds say, I was silly, you wanna be there. Like it's, do not share it's, give our brain. Yeah. 

00:47:25
DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY But look at how this is shaped, your life, Sebastian, and all of the sudden your telling me after 40 minute meeting that it seems laughable, this thing that has distressed you for so many years. like, so, you start to understand how powerful a theme could be and how you can shape your every decision, how you can shape, how you function in the world and how you feel that your life and what you really afraid of it and it triggers and all of a sudden you do 40 minutes and you go it. That storyline is not what it was. 

00:47:55
SEBASTIAN But it's fine, 'cause I went… I went away this weekend and I just like… I was for college football interpret. You know, I came back Sunday night I had that fear that the large should have been changed. You know that… that and I go, I don't do anything, you know, from the last three days I was really bored, but I guess it still have that, some feeling, you know, yesterday, last night, I'm going maybe, oh, what's that? The feeling, now when I'm saying that was it was (inaudible ). So and it fun, funny feeling.
