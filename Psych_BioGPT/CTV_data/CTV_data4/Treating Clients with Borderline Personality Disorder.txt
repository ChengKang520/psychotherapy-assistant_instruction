00:00:10
RICH SIMON Welcome, everyone. Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker. Welcome to this Networker webcast: the Six Biggest Challenges Therapists Face. When you ask many therapists what's the most challenging kind of client that they have, I think many of us know what the answer, well, of course, it's treating the borderline client. So, today, we have, uh, the, as our guest, fortunate to have, um, someone who's, uh, been a contributor to Networker for many years and, uh, present, frequent presenter of the symposium, developer of the Internal Family Systems model, and, uh, someone who believes that the main issue in treating the borderline client is a set, is, really, the therapists own Internal Family System and reactivity. And, uh, that's what we're going to be talking about today, so let's get right into it and welcome Dick Schwartz. Hey Dick. 

00:01:10
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Hey Rich. 

00:01:10
RICH SIMON How are you? 

00:01:15
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Good. Good to be with you. 

00:01:15
RICH SIMON You're all, all bundled up for, for summer weather up in Boston. 

00:01:20
RICHARD SCHWARTZ I'm in Boston and, uh, I hope to move here at some point, but it's not a big draw today. 

00:01:25
RICH SIMON All right. 

00:01:25
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Yeah, low 50's. 

00:01:25
RICH SIMON All right, well, I'm glad you took off your overcoat for us. So, uh, let's, uh, let's get in here. So your, well, so, talk about your ex, experience as a, a young therapist working with clients who are diagnosed as borderline. Was it this, this, uh, this was a, uh, did you find this particular treatment population, if I may use that term, challenging as a, as a younger therapist? 

00:02:00
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Yeah, of course, and part of the reason was that I was, uh, thinking about what was going on in a way that many therapies do, which is that I had to try and control all the out, out of control symptoms. And, and I also would take personally a lot of the challenging aspects that, the ways that clients would challenge me or try to manipulate me or control what happened or want to invade my life in different ways, or... 

00:02:30
RICH SIMON So, for example, what, what kinds of things that taking personally, what, what, what sort of behaviors are we talking about? 

00:02:35
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Well, uh, for example, I would have a client who, whenever I would look distracted, would have a big reaction, like I was abandoning her totally. 

00:02:45
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:02:45
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And, as you know, I'm not the best at, at always looking like I'm paying attention. 

00:02:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:02:55
RICHARD SCHWARTZ So, uh, sessions would, would be, would be going along fine, and then, suddenly, she'd be enraged at me. And, of course there's a part of me that rises to the, to the occasion... 

00:03:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:03:05
RICHARD SCHWARTZ (inaudible ), you know? 

00:03:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:03:10
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And, uh, and so we would get into it around whether or not I did it and, often as is true with a lot of these clients, the content of what she's saying is so exaggerated, in terms of what I did to her, that I would argue around that content. And... 

00:03:30
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:03:30
RICHARD SCHWARTZ It would just escalate, and... 

00:03:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:03:30
RICHARD SCHWARTZ to the point where there was, potentially, a rift in our relationship. And then would come sympoms like cutting and suicidal threats and so on. 

00:03:45
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:03:45
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And that, that would scare me more, and I would get more coercive or threaten more hospitalization or, um, and it would escalate to the point where authorities would have to come in at some point and... 

00:04:00
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:04:00
RICHARD SCHWARTZ What I know now, that I didn't know then, is that everything I was doing then was just simply scaring her more and more because the biggest fear was being abandoned and... 

00:04:10
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:04:10
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Any little shift I would make would look like I was leaving her, abandoning her in the session, which would trigger one of her, what I call, protectant parts. 

00:04:20
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:04:25
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Who would try to coerce me into coming back. And then, I would react to the coercion because it was extreme, it is extreme. 

00:04:30
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:04:30
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And then I, and then that would escalate even more. And, uh, so, yeah, and I've, you know, subsequently, as I learned how to get out of those kinds of, of, uh, traps with such clients, supervise people who found themselves in a similar position all the time. 

00:04:50
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:04:50
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And, uh, so, yeah, that's, I guess, what I'd like to talk about. 

00:04:55
RICH SIMON So, okay, so, uh, I think people who, therapists listening to this, many of them, at least, will recognize what you're talking about; different, variety of different patterns or behaviors, but just, somehow, the sense of a, a hair trigger. Something as, uh, uh, uh, these are very intense relationships with clients, and it seems the stakes seem extremely high, and what seems like ordinary interaction, uh, and, and the give and take of, of human relationship, uh, leads to, uh, ex, extreme emotional response. So, moving, uh, from that; so, what made a difference? What's, uh, how, how is it that you began to, what is it that you learned and what is it that you began to do differently in your working with this sort of client? 

00:05:50
RICHARD SCHWARTZ I think what I learned, uh, the most was the futility of actually trying to, to, um, correct mis-perceptions of me or of the world or to try and control the, the symptoms that were out of, seemed out of control. To, to get into futility and power struggle, basically. 

00:06:15
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:06:15
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And learning, learning that the hard way a few times. Um, and, and a lot of how I learned that was as I shifted into this parts world, where I would talk to clients, not about their personalities but about the parts of them that were doing these things, and asking a lot of questions about why, rather than trying to get them to stop. What I learned was that these protective parts of them that would go after me or try to manipulate me or would cut themselves or would make them suicidal were really trying to deal with parts of them that were frozen in time and dreadful scenes in the past. And as long as that was there, these Protectors would have to do what they do. So, once I sort of got that, then the goal became, rather than control all this... 

00:07:10
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:07:15
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Uh, or even have them try to control it, um, instead it was to try to get to the parts, get permission to go to the parts that were in these bad places that they never wanted to visit again. 

00:07:30
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:07:30
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And, actually, begin to heal those and finding that as I could do that, the Protector parts would shift out, out of their extreme roles on their own and I wouldn't have to force them. So, it became a much more collaborative and, in addition, what happened was, as I got that, as I got that this wasn't about me, really, that anybody who would look, in any way, like they were going to abandon this client would get the same level of protection; sort of like the Mafia, you know, it's business, it's not, it's not personal. 

00:08:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:08:05
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Whoever's in my chair is going to get shot, you know. 

00:08:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, right. 

00:08:10
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Um, I wouldn't take things personally. 

00:08:15
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:08:15
RICHARD SCHWARTZ I would learn not to go with the content because it was exaggerated, and just, ‘okay, she's really triggered.’ Most of the border-lines I treated then, women also, most of them are survivors of sex abuse, which the research has shown is a high percentage of borderline clients. 

00:08:35
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:08:35
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Sex abuse below the age of seven, usually. So, uh, these, they were hurt really young, and their parts are still stuck back in some of those scenes. Uh, felt totally abandoned and betrayed and it's very easy for me to have even slight behaviors that are going to be reminiscent of that. And then their part would, would turn me into the, uh, the offender comes out. 

00:09:05
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:09:10
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Hence the level of charge directed at me. 

00:09:10
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:09:15
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Or, the opposite is I'm, I'm, either that or I'm the, the hero, who's going to make everything good and they want to move into my house and they want to, you know, call me six times a day, or... 

00:09:25
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:09:25
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Uh, so it's, it's, not to say that it's easy work, but if you're understanding it in this more, less pathologizing and more, uh, pain-based way... 

00:09:40
RICH SIMON M-hmm, m-hmm. 

00:09:40
RICHARD SCHWARTZ You don't take it personally, you know what's going on when the, the extreme reactions are happening and you can stay steady, yourself. And, uh, that, for me, is the key, it's the, the lack of overreaction in the therapist... 

00:09:55
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:09:55
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And, and the perception, the sort of perspective about what's happening and why. 

00:10:00
RICH SIMON And main, maintaining that. Okay, so, let, let's give people a sense of how you get the client to move, begin to move in this direction and to begin to see their issues from the viewpoint of different parts and, and what you've been describing for us in, in, uh, giving us the overview of how, how the, you, you begin a relationship with a client and then begin this sort of work with them. So, it's, in a very, in a first session, somebody is coming in and they're, um, uh, they're cutting, they're suicidal, they're displaying symptoms subtle, or may, or not so subtle, uh, uh, Borderline Personality Disorder. Tell us a little bit about what, how do you organize the session and the kinds of things what you might actually say to a client as you begin your, uh, the therapeutic engagement with them. 

00:11:00
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Okay, do you want to role play? 

00:11:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:11:00
RICHARD SCHWARTZ All right. 

00:11:00
RICH SIMON I'm always, all, all, always feel healed out of, out of one of our role plays, so just tell me what to do. 

00:11:10
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Uh, well, okay. You be this client, and, uh... 

00:11:10
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:11:10
RICHARD SCHWARTZ I'll just, how can I help you? 

00:11:15
RICH SIMON Uh, I just, uh, I'm, I'm up and down all the time, just, life's, just feels so dark. I don't know, I can't, I just, I've felt this way as long as I can remember and, uh, I, I'm, I feel suicidal, I feel, uh, sometimes I just don't know how I'm going to go on, I'm, uh, sometimes, I don't know, I just feel numb half the time. Other times, i just feel like I'm not, uh, I just can't make it and, and, sometimes, I don't even know why I do it, but I'll just start cutting on myself just, I don't know, to feel like I'm alive? Uh, I, I don't, I don't know what to do anymore. 

00:12:00
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Okay. So, it sounds like, for a long time, you've had parts of you that feel very desperate and, and upset a lot, and then other parts of you that'll try to get away by, 'okay, we can kill ourselves to go out of this,' and then other parts that will numb you somehow and make it so you don't feel anything. Maybe to get away from that desperation? And then other parts that sometimes cut. Does that sound true? 

00:12:35
RICH SIMON You know, I never thought about it that way before. What's this parts? These are just parts of me? That, I mean, that's how I feel. 

00:12:40
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Yes. Yes, that's the way I think about it; that it isn't all of you who wants to kill yourself, obviously not. 

00:12:45
RICH SIMON Huh. 

00:12:50
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Or you would be dead. So... 

00:12:50
RICH SIMON Maybe so. 

00:12:50
RICHARD SCHWARTZ There's you and then there's the part of you who tells you, 'maybe we should kill ourselves to get out of this.' Does that sound right? 

00:13:00
RICH SIMON Okay. I, yeah, I guess. I got, I think I'm going to have to think about that, but that sounds like, yeah, that's sort of how it is. Yeah, maybe. 

00:13:05
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Yeah. That's the way I think of myself and, and it's the way I think of everybody. We have all these little voices or impulses in our minds that are arguing all the time about the best way to handle things, and then we also have all these big, scary emotions inside that we can't handle, we try to get away from. 

00:13:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. I don't even know what I'm scared of half the time. Just, it just feels hopeless. 

00:13:35
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Yeah. So that, there's another part, maybe, that says, 'oh, it's just totally hopeless, you've tried everything; nothing seems to work, you're just stuck like this.' 

00:13:45
RICH SIMON Oh, yeah, okay, maybe so. 

00:13:45
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Yeah. So, the reason I'm talking this way is because I've developed a way of helping people like you get to know and, and, uh, help heal some of these parts that seem so intractable, seem so overwhelming and out of control. And it's, uh, simply getting to know them better. 

00:14:10
RICH SIMON Hmm, getting to know them better? 

00:14:10
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Yeah. So, it's a kind of an inner dialogue process. And when you do it... 

00:14:15
RICH SIMON So, this is like this thing of multiple personalities, or, you know, you, you see these things on television or something. You know, like, am I that, am I weird? 

00:14:25
RICHARD SCHWARTZ No. People who you've seen on television like that are like all of us, except that their parts have been much more blown apart and so they come out as full autonomous beings and often aren't even connected to the others. 

00:14:40
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:14:40
RICHARD SCHWARTZ The rest, most of us, who haven't been hurt quite that badly, ours interact and get along and, and sometimes, and sometimes don't, and, um, it, they don't make us feel quite so separate, but their, their parts (inaudible ). And I've got them, and it's my belief that everybody has them. It's, it's normal. 

00:15:00
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:15:00
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Just that people with those multiple personalities, theirs got blown apart more. 

00:15:10
RICH SIMON Huh. So, what, how can I, what can I do? I mean, I just, sometimes I feel like I just can't go on, so what, it, how can you help me? 

00:15:25
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Well, I can start by, you can identify what makes it the hardest to think about going on. And then, we, I can have you begin some work with that part that feels the worst. Now, before we get there, there's probably other parts of you that don't want us to go to that, so we'll have to talk to them and get permission. So, everything we do, you're in control of and, and you have, you're the boss in this process. So we never go places... 

00:15:50
RICH SIMON Huh. That, that, that'll be, that, that's, that'll be a new experience. 

00:15:55
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Right. We never go places that you don't give us permission to go. 

00:16:00
RICH SIMON Wow. 

00:16:00
RICHARD SCHWARTZ It's very collaborative. We, I'm always asking you, 'does this feel okay, or is this too much?' Sort of like that. 

00:16:10
RICH SIMON So, you, I don't even know I've got these selves, so does it, it matter that, uh, that what you're saying, maybe it's true, I don't really know, but I never really thought of it that way. Does that make any difference? 

00:16:20
RICHARD SCHWARTZ No, it doesn't. Um, we can jump in, just see how it goes for you. If it doesn't feel right, we won't do it, but if it does, then we'll just see how it goes. Uh, and we can start anywhere; we can start with the suicidal part, is often a good place to start. Or, is there a part of you that is hard on you, that is critical of you a lot? 

00:16:40
RICH SIMON Oh, yeah. 

00:16:45
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Yeah. So, that's often a good place to start. Um, the cutting part, it's up to you. 

00:16:50
RICH SIMON Uh, you know, well, you know. My family, they're, I mean, they're worried about this cutting part. You know, like, they, they're just always looking at me and seeing if I've done that or if I'm wearing a long-sleeve shirt or something. Um, so they're always, they're always bugged, it matters, you know, I mean, that's a big part of why I'm here is them. So, you know, maybe that's a good place to start. 

00:17:20
RICHARD SCHWARTZ That sounds good. I'm happy to do that. Uh, so do you want to step out for a second, Rich? 

00:17:25
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:17:25
RICHARD SCHWARTZ So, it's like that. I, I mean... 

00:17:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:17:30
RICHARD SCHWARTZ I would have done much more with history and current context assessment before I started right in like that, and... 

00:17:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:17:35
RICHARD SCHWARTZ (inaudible ). 

00:17:40
RICH SIMON Yeah, so. So, so, uh, and fill us in a little bit more, so, I mean, that's just staying with that for the moment. I mean, it, it feels on the, this end, here, it's very reassuring, whatever I'm doing is fine, uh, it is a, uh, uh, you're, you're giving me something that both seems very dramatically different than how I think about myself, and at the same time, it seems, you're making it seem absolutely ordinary, extremely safe, and that I'm in control of the process. And that, it's like, it's almost like I, what gets communicated is I, you know, I can do no wrong as long as, uh, uh, uh, and I, I guess that's a big part of what's, what you're trying to communicate in that, in that first kind of engagement. 

00:18:25
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Exactly. Yeah, and the, you were accurate in the concern about, 'do you think I'm like Sybil?' cuz a lot of clients with, uh, this diagnosis have been in other settings where they were treated very pathologically, and they often do know that they have little voices that, and they think maybe they are like that, but they're very defensive about it. 

00:18:50
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:18:50
RICHARD SCHWARTZ So that's, that's often a, that's a common first reaction. 

00:18:55
RICH SIMON That people want to bring that up. 

00:18:55
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Yeah. 

00:19:00
RICH SIMON So, it's, so, but, we're going to, I'm going to kind of move on and get a sense of how you, uh, work with people, but, what, uh, early on, what, uh, what other information? So you have that immediate engagement, you have, uh, all the things we talked about so far, and then, you were saying a moment ago that this, you, in this initial assessment. So, what else do you want to know before you move on in the work? 

00:19:20
RICHARD SCHWARTZ You know, I, I like knowing about all the, it's what I call scary Firefighter activities, so, um, it's, you, you first, right away, you mentioned suicide and cutting. 

00:19:35
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:19:35
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Often there are others. Um, it's touchy to ask about that right away, too early, so... 

00:19:40
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:19:40
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Ideally, it does come out in just the conversation like this. 

00:19:45
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:19:45
RICHARD SCHWARTZ But it is, it is some, I, I like to know the kind of minefield, the (inaudible ), the potential, uh, mines we might step on as we, uh, do the delicate work inside. So, I like to know that upfront. 

00:20:00
RICH SIMON So, how do you, how do you, how do you get that information? What kinds of questions do you ask? 

00:20:05
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Uh, you know, sort of, like I said, I asked, ‘is there this critic inside?’ You know, and you said, ‘yes.’ 

00:20:10
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:20:10
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And I might, at some point, say, ‘and you know, there might be, you might get desperate to the point where you might even think about killing yourself. Is that right?’ Or you might think about... 

00:20:20
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:20:20
RICHARD SCHWARTZ That most, a lot of people who feel this do this and try to keep it fairly normal... 

00:20:25
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:20:25
RICHARD SCHWARTZ But also, uh, just letting me know what I'm getting into, so... 

00:20:30
RICH SIMON How much history do you need, how, how much, how detailed do you, uh, go in, in, uh, in people's, uh, you know, psychiatric history, their previous treatment, or, uh, all the different, these kinds of details of people's lives? 

00:20:50
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Yeah, I like to know, uh, previous treatment; in particular, how it went and what kind of relationship and what, how, um, how much hopelessness there is because of their previous treatment. 

00:21:05
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:21:05
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Uh, how discouraged clients are coming in to this. 

00:21:10
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:21:10
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Um, I'm also very interested in the current context and how safe it is. So, if they're living with somebody, how reactive would that person be to them, uh, getting very vulnerable, for example? 

00:21:25
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:21:25
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Or, or how does that person react to their behaviors? Like, your family is looking at your sleeves all the time. 

00:21:30
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:21:30
RICHARD SCHWARTZ So, you know, I'm still a family therapist, I'm still trying to, to evaluate... 

00:21:35
RICH SIMON Get the context. 

00:21:35
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Context and, and how much space the client has to actually begin to change without triggering people around her. 

00:21:45
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:21:45
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Uh, so, and, I'll also, uh, again, it's a delicate question, so, if it feels okay, I might ask about abuse coming into the history. 

00:21:55
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:21:55
RICHARD SCHWARTZ But, uh, if it doesn't, I'll just wait on that cuz it'll come out as we get into the parts (inaudible ). 

00:22:05
RICH SIMON Okay. And so, in your experience, you're saying this, before, this isn't a universal, but it sounded like you were saying in the majority of cases that you're aware of and the research that you're, that you were citing, that people had an experience of being sexually abused before the age of seven that was, that was, that was related to being diagnosed as a borderline. 

00:22:30
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Yeah. Yeah, the, the research, I think it's up to, like, 80 percent, uh, and, you know, psychiatric patients, in general, there are a number of surveys that are in the 50 percent. So it's, um, for me, I don't, I don't know about, you know, I, I have a limited number of clients and I specialize in the treatment of severe sex abuse, so the clients that come to me often come for that reason and, and show this, this pattern and parts that is called Borderline Personality. 

00:23:05
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:23:05
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Uh, so, it's hard for me to say in any definitive, but the research that I've read doesn't (inaudible ) up to 80 percent have that in their background. 

00:23:15
RICH SIMON Wow. Okay. So, okay, so, so two things; let's, let's just, for those people who may not be familiar with Internal Family Systems, let's just, uh, uh, briefly, let's just get you, let's, let's talk about a few of your terms and, uh, what they mean and, and, uh, Exiles and Firefighters and so, and so forth. So, maybe you can give us a little cram course in Internal Family Systems, but, um, let, let's get that done first. And then, I'd like to give us an overview, here, of the different, how the, how this process works in your, uh, the, your, your work with borderlines and if there's kind of a, a overall pattern; we can get to that in a moment. But let's just, let's, uh, in, in Internal Family Systems in, in a, in a highly condensed form for those people who may, may not be familiar with it, if you, if you wouldn't mind. 

00:24:10
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Yeah, so, the basic idea is that everybody, like I was saying to you when we were role playing, has a multiple personality; that we all have these parts and that virtually every psychotherapy that's done in-depth work has run into that. My position is similar to a few other schools, but is different from most in that I see them as all valuable; I see them as a normal state of mind to have parts, to be sub-divided, and that we're born with these resources, but that experience, like sex abuse and a lot of other kinds of (inaudible ). Experiences force them out of their naturally valuable states, either into protective roles or, because they're so hurt, they become what I call ‘Exiles' inside, so they try to lock them away and not experience them anymore because they're stuck in these times when we got something, some can have the potential to overwhelm us and pull us back into those times. 

00:25:10
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:25:15
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And a lot of the protective parts are designed to try and keep that from happening, to try and organize and control our life in the outside world so these Exiles don't get triggered, or to control our bodies, numb ourselves, as you were saying, uh, so that we don't feel it if they do get triggered and you get upset. 

00:25:35
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:25:35
RICHARD SCHWARTZ So, so the Exiles are often young, uh, very vulnerable, sensitive parts of us that are delightful when they're not hurting, but when they do get hurt, they make us feel horrible. So, we all spend a lot of time trying to stay away from all that, and we don't realize that their delightful parts just hurt but can heal; instead we see them as something, like you were saying, desperate and scary and something you've got to really work to get away from. 

00:26:10
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:26:10
RICHARD SCHWARTZ So, borderline clients have that (inaudible ); they just have parts that are stuck in dreadful places that, uh, they never want to feel and whenever they do, and are very easily triggered by even comments in a relationship, or certain kinds of movements, as I was saying. 

00:26:30
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:26:30
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And when a Exile gets triggered, then a Protector comes out to try and change that person ; either get them to stop abandoning them or get them to look back at them or, you know, control them in some way, or another Protector will tell them to run up, run out the door, get the hell away. 

00:26:55
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:26:55
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Or go cut or go kill themselves cuz, or anticipate the abandonment and abandon the person first, or, you know, a whole variety of things like that. So, these are all what I call Protector parts, some of which, managing the outside world and the inside world, are on all the time and working hard; it's why they call them managers. 

00:27:15
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:27:15
RICHARD SCHWARTZ They're often critics cuz they're so, working so hard to control the client so they don't continue to get hurt, but they're also the ones that get, that, uh, well, they have that kind of chronic irritability and an anticipation of being rejected, uh, that we find in these clients. Then, there's a class I call the Firefighters because when an Exile gets triggered, it's like an explosion of flames inside and somebody has to do something immediately to put out that fire of emotion. So, that's all the impulsive kinds of behaviors; the, the rage, the, the, the suicide, the, um, cutting, uh, sexual acting-out, all those kinds of things are when an Exile, when a client feels so desperate they've got to do something to get away from that. 

00:28:10
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:28:10
RICHARD SCHWARTZ To, to get higher than the flames or to put out the fires, douse it with some substance... 

00:28:15
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:28:15
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Or distract or dissociate. 

00:28:20
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:28:20
RICHARD SCHWARTZ So, so all of those, the, that's the system of parts that comes into the office, and then the other piece of the model, that is really the centerpiece of it, is that, in addition to that, there is this, what I call Self, once these parts will separate is at our core and can, has the eight C-word qualities of calm, compassion, clarity, creativity, courage, connectiveness, and I think confidence, I didn't mention. 

00:29:00
RICH SIMON We can call Rick Perry and, and see if he remembers what the, what these are. Okay, yes. 

00:29:05
RICHARD SCHWARTZ So, uh, and, uh, even in clients who are so (inaudible ) and show no signs of any of those qualities that my experience, now, over 30 years of doing this, is that as I convince some of these parts to open space inside that state comes forward, which is now in the field we call mindfulness. And Marsha Linehan's work uses a lot of mindfulness kinds of work helping parts separate, in my mind, separate from these parts of them that are so out of control. 

00:29:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:29:40
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And observe them from a, a kind of detached, but accepting place, you know, a place of... so, to me that's a great first step. It's, it's helping clients separate out of all of that, get into this... 

00:29:50
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:29:55
RICHARD SCHWARTZ This place I call Self, but instead of just staying separate and, and passively witnessing them, I encourage clients to begin to get to know them and hear about why they're so crazy out of control. And inevitably, invariably, clients will hear what happened to make this cutting part do its job. 

00:30:15
RICH SIMON M-hmm, m-hmm. 

00:30:20
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And as they learn that, they shift, not, not only are they curious, but now, they feel compassion and kind of, uh, kind of uh, appreciation for how the part actually saved their life and it was necessary to do that. When it was necessary, in the past, to get them out of their body, the part actually stepped forward and did the job to get them out of their body. 

00:30:45
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:30:45
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And as the part feels that shift away from everybody hating it and fighting it, and instead appreciating it, it starts to relax more. But it won't give up its job until the parts, the Exiles, that it protects have been healed, and what it takes to do that, then, needs to get permission from this Protector to go to what it's protecting and clients who again feel, immediately, this, this younger part of their child and will, I'll ask how they feel toward it. And if I can get them into this, what I call Self state, (inaudible ) child, hear his story of how hurt, how it got hurt, which often involves a thread of overwhelm. They'll, they start to feel some of the feelings again and it's pretty scary. 

00:31:35
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:31:35
RICHARD SCHWARTZ So the ways we have of, of trying to deal with that, um, so they're not overwhelmed while they can actually be with all of the events, the history, of what happened, as well as the emotions, the sensations, uh, and be mindful at the same time they're with all of that. And once a client's part, Exile part, feels like they really get what happened, how bad it was, then we can actually have a client enter the scene and hold that child and bring her out of that time which is a separate place into a safe place. At that point, these parts are willing to, what I call heal, translates into unload the emotions and beliefs they've been carrying from those times, and then they transform. And then the Protector, the cutting part, in this case, doesn't have to keep doing that to them. 

00:32:30
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:32:30
RICHARD SCHWARTZ It's willing, it's willing to go back to its natural, invaluable state, which, uh, you never can predict what that's going to be, but they always want to leave these, these jobs they're in cuz they don't like having to do this to the client. 

00:32:45
RICH SIMON M-hmm. Okay. So, so, a way of describing this, and what you, last fall, uh, you wrote a piece about this process, one of any number that you've done for the magazine where you're talking about, uh, your work in the context of mindfulness and the kind of healing relationship between self and part that you were contrasting, at least, with certain traditions of, um, Buddhist meditation where there, there remains a distance between the parts and this central consciousness. So, what, uh, uh, and, and, uh, it seemed at that time, in that piece, and, and in talking with you then, you were describing, maybe this is more my language, here, and you tell me how, how this fits with you, is that a kind of internal attachment experience where this, this central consciousness, uh, is able to embrace and provide a kind of, for want of a better term, and attachment experience to this, these small, abused parts, in a way that one would hope for externally. An abused child might have, might find a caretaker in the world to, uh, give them love and security and with whom they can have some trust. Is, is, is that part of what this, of the, would that describe an aspect of this work that you do with the, with your borderline clients? 

00:34:05
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Yeah. You know, all of those clients have big attachment issues and, uh, traditional therapy, the therapist would become the good attachment figure and doing that. 

00:34:20
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:34:20
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And, uh, in I.F.S., we try to embody qualities of a good attachment figure, but not so that we, directly, are the ones who, um, become the attachment figure for the Exiles. 

00:34:35
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:34:35
RICHARD SCHWARTZ But instead, create, through our presence, the kind of safety that allows the client's Self to emerge, allows the Protectors to trust this is a safe person to be with... 

00:34:45
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:34:45
RICHARD SCHWARTZ You don't have to be so protective. You can relax and the Self can, spontaneously emerges, and then they become the attachment figure to these Exiles. So... 

00:35:00
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:35:00
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And many of the Exiles show the different patterns , it's very interesting, of, uh, the, um, insecurely attached children, inner children. There are avoidedly attached inner children and, and there are children that, there are children that alternate between those, which are called disorganized and attached. 

00:35:20
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:35:25
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And so, as self shows up in this very patient, consistently loving, uh, way, and, uh, proves to these parts that they, they can connect to this Self, then they aren't so desperately in need of relationships, which is why they're so reactive to the threat of abandonment and when all their relationships have gone south because they're so controlling of their partner (inaudible ). The other partners get sick of all of the acting out and a lot of that is simply because they're so desperate and so afraid of being, uh, abandoned because these parts feel that way. As their parts reconnect, are no longer looking for, maybe, the abuser to come back and, be it their father or their mother, or are, now trust that there's this person inside of them that they can get that from. 

00:36:25
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:36:25
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Then, they're no longer so needy of getting from the outside, whether it's a parent or a parent surrogate that they hook onto as a partner, intimate partner. 

00:36:40
RICH SIMON Yup, yup. Okay. So, we, you know, we have about ten minutes, here. Um, so, so, uh, this, this first part; let's just see if we can give people a sense of what's the process, what's the, the healing process in this, this way that you work with this sort of client? So, it sounds, it sounds, so far, it sounds like a big part of this early stage is your, the certain amount of education; you're offering a map, a different road map, and many people, first time they ever considered such a road map for themselves, um, and you're identifying and giving them a language of parts, of protective parts and Exiles and Firefighters, and then evoking this quality of Self, capital S. And, and it, when you, and, and, maybe you could say a little bit so that the first stage, and tell me if this feels right, at first stage is you're, is, is, uh, a lot of that; is you're trying to, you know, you have a shared model of the world with your client and you're showing them this Internal Family Systems world. In terms, it's experientially, you're, when you evoking this core Self, what seemed to be, really, uh, the, the center piece, here, there's a, it, there's, there is no core Self. I mean, that's really, that's the hope and that's the center of the therapy. So, what have you learned about the most powerful ways, the most effective ways; you're saying it emerges. Are there some ways that you've found that are better than others in helping this core Self to emerge in the client's experience? 

00:38:20
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Yeah. Um, especially with this population because there are populations, cuz there're a lot of therapists that will do it through skill-building or breathing exercises or, you know, various mindfulness practices to try and evoke Self. 

00:38:35
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:38:35
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Uh, what try to rebuild it somehow. 

00:38:40
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:38:40
RICHARD SCHWARTZ My assumption is it's there, it's there intact, it hasn't been damaged by trauma. 

00:38:45
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:38:45
RICHARD SCHWARTZ So, the goal isn't really to build it up and develop it, the goal is simply to help it emerge, help it be released. 

00:38:55
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:38:55
RICHARD SCHWARTZ So, uh, generally, I'll start by having the client get to know one or two parts. Maybe to start with, like, if we had focused on that cutting part we started to... 

00:39:05
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:39:05
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Then, I would have them, I would ask them, ‘how do you feel toward that as you notice it in your body?’ 

00:39:10
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:39:10
RICHARD SCHWARTZ (inaudible ) impulse. And that question, ‘how do you feel toward it?’... 

00:39:15
RICH SIMON Toward it. 

00:39:15
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Comes the, the gauge by which we judge how much Self is present. 

00:39:20
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:39:20
RICHARD SCHWARTZ If they hate it, then that's some other part, usually a manager, that's trying desperately to keep it under control; if it lies with the family, and that it doesn't like the scars or whatever. So, I might say, ‘could you ask, I understand why this part hates it, but, just so we can get to know it a little bit without hating it, could you ask that one who hates it so much just to step back a little bit?’ And, to my other amazement, to this day... 

00:39:50
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:39:50
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Most clients will say, ‘okay, let's step back.’ 

00:39:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:39:55
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Step back. And then if I ask the next question, ‘how do you feel toward the cutting part now?’ often, they'll say, ‘I'm just kind of curious about why it's doing it.’ And then we know, okay, we've got what I call the Critical Mass of Self to get some kind of a dialogue going in a good way. 

00:40:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:40:15
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And sometimes, it can happen just that quickly. Other times, you have to work with the one who hates it, first, for quite a bit to convince it that it's okay. You're not going to have it take over more, so on. And there's some of that I get involved in, in talking directly to these parts. Um, so it just depends. 

00:40:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:40:35
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And, but, I would say this; uh, to an amazing degree, given the literature on this population, many clients can get there quite quickly. 

00:40:45
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:40:45
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And, and when they do, then I'll begin that, you know, just ask the cutting part why it does that. And if the cutting part senses the client's Self, rather than this, the one who harass, harasses it all the time... 

00:41:00
RICH SIMON The judgmental or managing, or, carry on. 

00:41:00
RICHARD SCHWARTZ It'll start to give real answers about why it does it. And if those answers always go either to some parts polarize (inaudible ), then it's afraid I'll take over if it doesn't do this, or to what it protects, which is usually these Exiles. There's always these Exiles. 

00:41:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:41:20
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And they'll give that up: ‘What are you afraid would happen if you didn't cut her?’ ‘I'm afraid she would feel.’ That's a common answer. 

00:41:30
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:41:30
RICHARD SCHWARTZ ’What are you afraid she would feel?’ ‘I'm afraid she'd feel all the pain, she'd be overwhelmed.’ ‘If we can deal with that pain in a different way, would you have to keep cutting?’ ‘No, but I don't think you can.’ ‘Would you give us a chance to show you that we can?’ It's something like that. 

00:41:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:41:40
RICHARD SCHWARTZ So, in the process of doing that, not only am I bringing forth, even for a moment, what I'm calling Self, but I'm helping the client understand totally differently these parts that seem so crazy to them, often, or seem so crazy to everybody else. 

00:42:00
RICH SIMON Yup. 

00:42:00
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And begin to relate to them in a far less polarized way, which helps those parts relax more, now. 

00:42:10
RICH SIMON So, once you've done this, this, the, this early stage and, seems like what you're talking about is, is the, the critical stage, where you've helped the client to identify the Self and begun a, a different kind of conversation. So, there's a different kind of conversation, internal conversation, as well as a therapeutic conversation, that you're inviting and that you're, and, and so that therapy, essentially, is the, uh, that conversation evolves for as long as treatment continues. 

00:42:45
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Uh-huh. 

00:42:45
RICH SIMON So, it's, it, at the, at the later stages of therapy, once you've, it, it seems key to get that conversation moving, is it, in terms of giving us a sense of the process, is there other, other, some critical, is there a critical juncture, here, of how that conversation changes so that you become less necessary in the process? 

00:43:05
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Well, what happens is as clients become more comfortable working in this inner world in the way they, I've described... 

00:43:15
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:43:15
RICHARD SCHWARTZ They begin to take over more and more. So, and they're doing it more and more on their own between sessions. 

00:43:20
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:43:20
RICHARD SCHWARTZ So, a lot of clients, at some point, will begin the first part of the session by I'll just hear about everything they did for 15 minutes... 

00:43:30
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:43:30
RICHARD SCHWARTZ In, during the, the week before, and they're saying, ‘well, I found this one and this one got triggered and so I went to it and I held it and this other one, and then I learned about it.’ 

00:43:45
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:43:45
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Just, I'll just keep silent and listen to all this. I'll say, ‘that's great, now, let's do some more, okay?’ And, and we'll go on from there. It becomes... 

00:43:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:43:50
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And, so the clients feel more and more like they're healing themselves and that, that it's them doing it themselves. And I'm just, I'm a coach, or a supporter, or a, you know (inaudible ). 

00:44:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. Huh. 

00:44:05
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And, and, uh, that cuts down all the transcripts, too, because when you become the one all the parts are looking to... 

00:44:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:44:15
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Then you can bombard it by all the... 

00:44:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:44:15
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Extremes of the parts. But, I've got Self as my co-therapist, who lives with the client, so... 

00:44:25
RICH SIMON That's right. 

00:44:25
RICHARD SCHWARTZ It, it makes my job a whole lot easier. 

00:44:30
RICH SIMON So, when is, uh, and so, when do you, uh, when's this process over? It's, it's a lifelong process, so when is, when do you say therapy, as we've been doing it, or, or how does it get determined that, that, that the therapy does, is not necessary anymore for a particular client? 

00:44:45
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Yeah, it's generally not my call. I, I, I've got my door pretty open, as long as clients needs me. 

00:44:55
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:44:55
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Uh, and, uh, so, the client, at some point, will say, ‘I feel like I've kind of got this. I know I've got more work to do, but I feel like I can do a lot it and if I can't, I'm going to come back.’ So... 

00:45:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:45:05
RICHARD SCHWARTZ That's, that's the way it's left. Uh, I have lots of clients out there, now, who come back and, and check in with me, you know, every year or year and a half. 

00:45:15
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:45:15
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Just a session to keep it going, you know. 

00:45:20
RICH SIMON Okay. Um, and the, this, um, this is a great variable, the, the time variable, but, in, in order to really, that, it doesn't seem, from what you're saying, it's not like this is an endless process, and in some cases, the, the, this is something that can happen fairly expeditiously. So, can you give us some time-frame or how different people in your practice, how it kind of sorts out for you about who are the folks who need less or more of their direct engagement with you? 

00:45:55
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Yeah, as you're saying, there is quite a range, and a lot depends on how much clients can do this on their own, like I was saying, and... 

00:46:00
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:46:00
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And for some clients, I'll take it and run with it, and, I mean, short is always relative, especially these days, so, but it can be as short as a year and a half to, you know, three years. 

00:46:15
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:46:15
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Um, um, people come in with that kind of history and diagnosis. 

00:46:20
RICH SIMON M-hmm, m-hmm. 

00:46:20
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Um, some clients, uh, for various reasons, their, their parts won't trust them to do much of it on their own, so they do need a lot, do a lot in session with me. 

00:46:30
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:46:30
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And, their external context is a mess, or is very, very triggering all the time. 

00:46:35
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:46:35
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And when that's the case, it just takes longer, and I'll try to do what I can with the external content. As I've said, I'm still a family therapist, I still bring in other people. 

00:46:45
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:46:50
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Uh, but, it just takes longer and can take, you know, up to six, seven years. 

00:46:55
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:46:55
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And I used to, cuz I come out of the same place you do, in terms of, of therapy, used to think I'm a big failure if it goes for, you know, four months; that's way too long, a lot of times. 

00:47:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:47:10
RICHARD SCHWARTZ So, I've really had to work with the part of me that (inaudible ). 

00:47:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:47:15
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Just, it takes as long as it takes, and the more that impatient part of me interferes, the longer it's going to take, so... 

00:47:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay, so, um, before, uh, we're just about out of time, here, uh, let's, uh, people who are interested in this kind of, um, work, and they want you, resources, training resources, they want to learn more about Internal Family Systems or the way your work with borderlines, where do they go? 

00:47:45
RICHARD SCHWARTZ The website is selfleadership.org. 

00:47:50
RICH SIMON Selfleadership.org, okay. 

00:47:50
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And we run trainings all over the country and in six countries in Europe and Israel(ph). 

00:47:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:47:55
RICHARD SCHWARTZ So, uh, trainings are, um, level one training is about a years' duration, six three-day weekends... 

00:48:05
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:48:05
RICHARD SCHWARTZ And, uh, like that. 

00:48:05
RICH SIMON Okay. Great, okay, and that, that, if people can get to selfleadership.org and there's a link on our, on the Networker site, it's part of this course, we're, uh, where you can get information about Dick and, and, his, his Internal Family Systems and this whole, um, network of therapists thing that he has developed these last 30 years. Um, want to, as always, invite people to, uh, join the conversation through the comment board, so that will appear on, you can see, at the bottom of your screen, uh, even though Dick and I, at the moment, cannot see it, but it, it, it, it will be there. Uh, and, um, it, it, whatever thoughts you have, whatever insights, ask questions, Dick will take a look at the comment board; if, if he is so moved, he may respond, he may not. But, in any case, the important thing is that the conversation that began today continues, we share our perceptions with each other individually, it's a benefit to everybody who takes part in this to put their, their thoughts, and, and questions and observations into language, and also just for all of us to be able to see what other people responded. Sir, thank you so much, uh, I feel more centered, more in Self, as I often do in our conversations. Thank you very much for spending this time and being part of this webcast series. 

00:49:35
RICHARD SCHWARTZ Always great, Rich. Thank you. Bye, bye. 

00:49:35
RICH SIMON Take care, everybody.
