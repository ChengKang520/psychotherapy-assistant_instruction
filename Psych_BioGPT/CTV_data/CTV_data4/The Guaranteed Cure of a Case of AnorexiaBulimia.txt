00:00:15
The Guaranteed Cure of A Case of Anorexia/Bulimia 

00:00:15
a film by Jay Haley & Madeleine Richeport-Haley 

00:00:15
KAY And I ordered a cheeseburger, bowl of chili, french fries, and onion rings. And then when it was time to go, I ordered two cheeseburgers, grilled cheese sandwich, two orders of french fries. And then on the way back to the office, I stopped at this little liquor store which is like a little store on the front of the street, and I got four candy bars, Twinkie, bag for Fritos, and a diet Pepsi. 

00:01:10
THERAPIST Okay, so what did you have for lunch, again? 

00:01:10
JAY HALEY This is a therapy training film, where the therapist focuses on a problem, and offers directives to bring about a change. In the approach used here, the therapist tells the clients that if they do what he says, they are guaranteed a change. The guaranteed cure technique must be planned and proposed with care, which is what this film is about. Because of confidentially issues, this film was performed by actors. However, they don't improvise. They study and edited video of the actual therapy sessions and exactly reproduced what was said and done in the therapy room. The setting is a one way mirror room with a supervisor behind the mirror who plans the therapy with the therapist and telephones suggestions. The supervisor was myself, Jay Haley, and the therapist was Robert Kirkhorn, an experienced therapist who was in training in this particular approach at this time. 

00:02:10
THERAPIST The first thing I wanna do is introduce you to this room. Our sessions are videotaped and this is a one way mirror. I have a colleague behind the mirror, who sometimes calls to offer me some assistance. And at the end of our sessions, I'll ask you to sign a release of information if you wish to do so. First thing I wanna do is hear a description in your own words of what the problem is, why you came in. 

00:02:35
DON I've, um, anorexia, bulimia, whatever you wanna call it. Um, I eat and throw up, eat and throw up maybe 5 times, sometimes 25 times a day. I can't stop. Um, I've been doing it since I was 18 or 19, about 11 years. Um. 

00:03:00
THERAPIST Is it averaging 25 times a day now? 

00:03:05
KAY No. I'm sorry . Um, no. Um, I'd say my minimum is about 4 times. 

00:03:20
DON Is that the average now? 

00:03:20
KAY No, that's my minimum. I'd say the maximum is 3 times that. 

00:03:25
JAY HALEY When there is an eating disorder and the client is married, it can be best to bring in the couple. This is not blaming the husband or the marriage, but is making use of the marriage to solve the symptom. A contract with the therapist is with both spouses. 

00:03:45
THERAPIST Can you add your description to the problem? 

00:03:45
DON My description of the problem? 

00:03:50
THERAPIST Mm-hmm. 

00:03:50
DON Well, the eating and throwing up. That's a problem. Um, but the worst part of it for me is the fact that Kay needs to be secretive in order to cover up her tracks. Um, that's the worst part of it for me. 

00:04:05
THERAPIST Okay. Can you tell us a little more? 

00:04:10
DON Well she, Kay and I have a very open relationship. We share everything together. Um, this is the one thing that she feels like she can't share with me. Um, first part, because she doesn't want to, and secondly, probably because more than likely I, you know, show some sort of disprovement, you know, depending on my mood that day. 

00:04:30
THERAPIST Okay, you sometimes comment when she does it. 

00:04:35
THERAPIST Yes. Um, I do. It's not like I, I physically, you know beat her or anything like that, but I do reject her. 

00:04:45
KAY You don't reject me. You, you never reject me, but you do, you are disappointed. 

00:04:50
DON Yeah, will not being involved in the actual act, uh, it's, it's like a nagging headache, which sometimes I wanna ask her if she's having a good day or I don't ask her at all. 

00:05:00
THERAPIST What do you consider to be a good day? 

00:05:00
DON Not binging. Not throwing up. That's a good day. It's a perfect day. 

00:05:10
THERAPIST So, there's a difference between a perfect day and a good day? 

00:05:10
DON Oh, yeah, I mean, um, you know, a good day is a perfect day. With Kay a perfect is a good day. You know, where she doesn't throw up. Really, at least that's what you've implied. 

00:05:20
KAY Yeah, and that's true. That's true. 

00:05:25
DON And those, those days do occur. 

00:05:25
KAY They occur, I would say, less frequently now than they did before. 

00:05:30
JAY HALEY There are therapists who think of symptoms as unimportant and wish to focus on what's behind them. Yet, people's lives are built around symptoms. With all the pleasures possible, this couple defines a good day in their life as whether the wife throws up. Focusing on symptoms seems the best approach in therapy and win's the most cooperation from clients. 

00:05:50
THERAPIST This problem has been going on for 11 years. You've been married for 5 years. Perhaps you could start before the marriage and fill me in briefly. 

00:06:00
KAY Well, I can't give you details because there was nothing. There was no treatment. 

00:06:05
THERAPIST Not at all for the first 5 years. 

00:06:10
KAY No. 

00:06:10
THERAPIST Where were you? 

00:06:10
KAY At home with my family. Well, I live with my grandmother, and my parents live next door. Um, I was heavy. I'd been on a diet since I was 12. Um, and I was on this one diet where you get shots, and I discovered this really neat trick, that I could eat whatever I wanted and just throw up. So, I started getting thinner and thinner. Um, sometimes I would starve myself. I do that for long periods of time. And then, I would eat and just throw up. And so, it was continual. 

00:06:50
THERAPIST Your folks were pretty understanding of that? 

00:06:55
KAY They weren't aware of the number of times I was throwing up. I mean I tried to explain, it had to be something physical. I mean, I don't know. I was just really weird. I mean, I was concerned, but I didn't, I didn't know. 

00:07:15
THERAPIST You didn't know that a lot of young women who wanted to lose weight would do something like that. 

00:07:15
KAY I thought nobody did that. 

00:07:20
DON We'd been married for about a year, and she really went fast as far as weight was concerned. She was at 110, and she went down to 95 pounds. We lived in an apartment. We bought a house. We did all those normal things. 

00:07:35
THERAPIST You didn't know about the vomiting? 

00:07:35
DON No, not at all. 

00:07:35
THERAPIST Not in the courtship period? 

00:07:40
DON It was well into the marriage. 

00:07:40
THERAPIST How far into the marriage? 

00:07:45
DON It's hard to say. Um, I mean, it, it's actually at the hospitalization that I finally knew. I mean, even you said, "Finally, somebody else knows about this." You know, she went down to 70, 75 pounds. That's when I finally knew. That's when we had put her in the hospital. 

00:08:00
THERAPIST You went down to 70 pounds in one year, and then what? You were hospitalized? 

00:08:05
KAY Yes. 

00:08:05
THERAPIST Was it in an anorexic ward? 

00:08:10
KAY No. No. 

00:08:10
DON No, it was the local loony bin. I mean, you get out of the elevator, and press seven. And everybody would look away from you. 

00:08:15
KAY Well, I knew as soon as I got out that was not the way to go. And, I read everything I could get my hands on about anorexia. And, I found a hospital with a behavior modification ward. And I went in. 

00:08:30
THERAPIST How did that help you. 

00:08:35
DON It got your weight back up. 

00:08:35
KAY Yeah. 

00:08:35
DON I mean, at that point, she was dying. There was no question about that. 

00:08:40
THERAPIST What did you weigh then? 

00:08:40
DON About 79 pounds? 

00:08:40
KAY Yeah. 

00:08:40
THERAPIST Is it 70 pounds is your critical weight. Anything below 70 pounds and you have to be hospitalized? 

00:08:50
JAY HALEY Although these questions seemed casual, they're bringing out important information. When dealing with anorectics, it's important to have a doctor available and to find out what is the critical weight when there must be hospitalization. 

00:09:00
KAY Came out I called the American Psychological Association. And I called everybody looking for therapy. Um, I was referred here. 

00:09:15
JAY HALEY The therapist brings up what will be the theme of this therapy. Are the two of them committed to getting over this problem? 

00:09:20
THERAPIST I wanna ask is, are you truly committed? I want you to think about this for a moment before you answer. Do you really want to get over this problem? 

00:09:30
KAY Some days I do. But, some days I don't. 

00:09:40
THERAPIST What I'm asking for is a commitment now from this day forward. Do you want to get over this problem? 

00:09:50
KAY Right now, yes. Yes. But, I don't know a month from now, because I fluctuate between wanting to and not wanting to. It's such a nice comfortable habit. 

00:10:05
THERAPIST So, you're really not committed to resolving this problem. 

00:10:10
KAY No, I didn't say that. I, yes, right this minute I am. I just don't know how long that will last, because it's hard, and it's a lot of work, and there's a lot of pain and aggravation. 

00:10:25
THERAPIST Well, there's a lot of pain and aggravation, given the treatments that you've gone through. 

00:10:30
KAY Yes. 

00:10:30
THERAPIST Not knowing what the cure would be here. What if you gained? I mean, what if you went up to 300 pounds? 

00:10:35
KAY I'd start over again. I'd start throwing up. 

00:10:40
THERAPIST Um, 120? 150 pounds? 

00:10:45
KAY I don't wanna gain the weight. 

00:10:45
THERAPIST What do you weigh now? 

00:10:50
[sil.] 

00:10:50
KAY 100. 97. Maybe 95, maybe 97. 

00:11:00
THERAPIST Do you weight yourself every day? 

00:11:05
KAY More than once a day. 

00:11:05
THERAPIST The most recent that you weighed yourself today, how much did you weigh? 

00:11:10
KAY I weighed myself this morning, and I weighted 97 pounds. 

00:11:10
THERAPIST How about you? Are you committed? Do you wanna see your wife get over this problem? Are you ready to put in whatever amount of energy, whatever amount of commitment, whatever it takes to have your wife get over this problem once and for all? 

00:11:25
DON Well, I can give you a similar answer, you know. Commit to what it takes, but you know, after a while it wears down on you. You know, it's harder on Kay than it is on me, because I, I, you know, I haven't been assigned any roles except as, as a reward. 

00:11:45
THERAPIST So, when treatment has been such that she's been good, you've come in and... 

00:11:50
DON I've been allowed to visit. But, even then she has managed to lie and, you know, and secretly binge. You know, I would like to see this end. You know, I'm committed to that. 

00:12:00
KAY Well, to, up to a point, but, when it starts to get hard for you, then it, it does get hard for me too. 

00:12:10
DON Yeah, but I haven't been assigned any tasks. 

00:12:15
JAY HALEY When a therapist focuses upon the symptom, all the details are important. There will be an intervention before, during or after. Here, the therapist asks for the necessary details. 

00:12:25
THERAPIST Typical situation like around a meal. I mean, I want, you can pick any, any meal during the day. I want to know details of, well, think about beforehand. What your plan is. How you go about executing your plan. And, where do you go when you eat? 

00:12:40
KAY On a binging day? Okay. Well, when I get up in the morning. 

00:12:55
THERAPIST You know, take, take a real day. Don't take a fictional day. Take, say, yesterday. 

00:13:00
KAY Okay. When I get up in the morning, every morning, I think I'm gonna do well this day. So, I have planned where I'm gonna go, and what I'm gonna eat for lunch. And, I think about that all morning long. That's my plan. That's how I'm gonna do it. 

00:13:25
THERAPIST Okay, so you wake up in the morning, and you think, "Today's gonna be a good day, which means I'm not going to vomit today." 

00:13:30
KAY Right. And I think up tricks to help me not do it, like I'll only take a certain amount of money with me, like yesterday. Um, I had planned to do well. And I know have to do it myself. So, I took the exact amount of money that I needed for my lunch, and for the paper. I was gonna get my lunch, get the paper, bring it back to my desk at the office, read the paper, eat my lunch, do the crossword puzzle. So, I went to the store, and I got my little cup of cabbage, my little cup of cole slaw. That's my lunch. Um, and then someone said, do you wanna go to lunch? 

00:14:20
THERAPIST What did you have for lunch again? 

00:14:20
KAY Okay, well, first I had the cabbage and the cole slaw. 

00:14:25
THERAPIST Okay, did you eat that before you left? 

00:14:25
KAY Yes, because I was doing well. I was, um, then I went and I had the cheeseburger, bowl of chili, french fries, onion rings. Then when it was time to go, I ordered the two cheeseburgers, grilled cheese sandwich. 

00:14:45
THERAPIST So. 

00:14:45
KAY Two french fries. 

00:14:45
THERAPIST When you were ordering, did you, were you thinking in your head, "Okay, tomorrow I'll try."? 

00:14:50
KAY Yes. 

00:14:50
THERAPIST So you had already resigned yourself that today was gonna be like yesterday, and I"m not gonna try. 

00:14:55
KAY Yes. And I stopped off at the store, and I got the other things. And I brought them back to the office. And, I ate all these things at my desk. And, my stomach was out to here. I was like, um, and then I just went to the restroom and threw up. 

00:15:20
THERAPIST So, how do you make yourself throw up? 

00:15:20
KAY I just, I just lean over. 

00:15:25
THERAPIST So, you just throw up, just by leaning over? Does it take more than one time to get all that food up or does it take several times? 

00:15:30
KAY Do you mean is it just one massive outpouring or is it more than one? It's, it's more than one. 

00:15:40
THERAPIST Okay, so, you vomit, and then you rest for a few minutes and then you do it again? Or? 

00:15:45
KAY Well, no, I do it continual until I feel it's pretty much all gone. But, it's not just one movement, it's several. And then I'll stop and I'll rest for a few minutes, because in my mind it's giving whatever is left in there a chance to settle back down into a place where I can get it back up. 

00:16:10
THERAPIST Mm. So, how do you know when you're done? 

00:16:15
KAY Well, it's, it's not clear bile. It's still food. Um, and usually I just keep going until there's only the air coming out. And I figure there's probably got to be a little bit more left in there. 

00:16:35
THERAPIST So, is that when you take your break for a few minutes? 

00:16:40
KAY Yes. 

00:16:40
THERAPIST Okay. 

00:16:40
KAY This is really gross. I'm sorry. 

00:16:50
THERAPIST I, I've heard it all before. 

00:16:50
JAY HALEY At this point, the supervisor behind the mirror decided the prognosis was good for this therapy. It had not been decided what the directive or intervention would be, but still whatever was done would require the woman's full cooperation. The fact that she was willing to describe this gross and unfeminine behavior before two men indicates that she wants to get over the problem. 

00:17:15
THERAPIST Have you been in the bathroom with her when she's done this? 

00:17:20
DON No. I walked in a couple of times. 

00:17:20
THERAPIST How do you know when you're done? 

00:17:25
KAY I know generally what the heaviest thing that I've eaten is. Say, I eat a marshmallow. Marshmallow is light so it floats. So, it floats to the top, and the heavier things go to the bottom of the food. So, when I start to see the marshmallow coming out, then I know that I'm getting close to the end. And, if I haven't had anything like that, like I can usually tell if I've had a salad before dinner because lettuce floats. So, when I start seeing the lettuce, then I know I'm probably pretty close to the end. 

00:18:00
THERAPIST Don, Don, um, any questions? I'm sort of curious since you've never actually been there with her, do you have any questions as to the process that she goes through? 

00:18:10
DON No, I, I, I've heard this process before. 

00:18:10
THERAPIST Do you find, take pleasure in it? Is any part of this enjoyable? 

00:18:15
KAY No. 

00:18:20
THERAPIST Any part that's enjoyable? None? 

00:18:20
KAY The eating. 

00:18:20
THERAPIST The eating's enjoyable? 

00:18:25
KAY Yes. 

00:18:25
THERAPIST What's the most you've ever weighted? 

00:18:25
KAY 150 pounds. 

00:18:35
THERAPIST If you could think of a weight that you could go up to, knowing that this would be the kick off weight. That anything above that, and you'd begin to vomit again. What can you image that weight to be? I, I should think 200 pounds would be too much. 

00:18:55
KAY You want a really honest answer? It might sound weird, but 100 pounds. 100 pounds makes me really nervous. 

00:19:10
THERAPIST Well, what would you consider the normal weight to be for a woman your height, a woman your size? 

00:19:15
KAY Another person? 

00:19:15
THERAPIST What do you consider to be the normal weight for you? 

00:19:20
KAY 100 pounds. 

00:19:20
THERAPIST 100 pounds is the weight that you feel you look your best that you wanna look? 

00:19:25
KAY Well, I can say that now because I don't weigh 100. If I weighed 100, I would probably, I would probably say 95. 

00:19:35
THERAPIST Maybe you can help us. What weight do you think your wife needs to be at, where you can look at her and say, "That's her weight." 

00:19:45
DON Uh, I, I know it. It's 115 to 110, somewhere in there. 

00:19:50
THERAPIST That's where you think she needs to be to look her best. 

00:19:50
DON That's when she looks good. That's when she looks her best. That's when she's most capable of handling herself. 

00:19:55
KAY I never weighed 110. 

00:20:00
DON We once used a goal of 105. 

00:20:00
KAY Yeah, okay. 

00:20:00
DON And, even then you could, you could have stood to gain more weight. 

00:20:05
KAY Yeah, that, that last time weighed that much was when we first met. So. 

00:20:10
THERAPIST Do you have any children? 

00:20:10
DON I have two from another marriage. 

00:20:15
THERAPIST Um, do you have custody of those children? Do you have visitation? Do you see them? Okay. 

00:20:20
JAY HALEY Information about the families of the couple is necessary since they might need to be brought in. There's also a search for the function of the symptom in the relationship of the couple and with their families. In this case the therapist and supervisor were unable to find a satisfactory hypothesis of why the symptomatic behavior was happening and why it was so severe. 

00:20:45
THERAPIST Um, where is your family? 

00:20:45
DON Um, my mother, my father, my, my grandparents, they're all gone. They're all dead. 

00:20:55
THERAPIST How about you? Where are your folks? 

00:21:00
KAY My parents live in another state. My grandmother, as well. Her entire family lives back there. 

00:21:05
THERAPIST Do, do you have contact with them? 

00:21:10
KAY My mother comes down about once every three months. Um, we went back, we saw my family at Thanksgiving. Yeah, the last time I saw my grandmother was at Thanksgiving. And, my dad, did I see my, yeah, I saw my dad at Thanksgiving. 

00:21:25
THERAPIST Okay. 

00:21:25
JAY HALEY It's best to have a baseline, an estimate of the frequency of the symptoms. Ordinarily, one would ask the client with the problem to keep track. In this case, it was thought important to involve the husband in the solution of the problem. Therefore, he should be involved in counting the frequency of the symptom. 

00:21:45
THERAPIST What I'm thinking of asking you of doing, for doing for next week is, Don I'm gonna ask you to help me out. I want you to keep a chart , a list of how many times Kay vomits in a day. 

00:22:00
DON You're assuming she's gonna tell me, right? 

00:22:10
THERAPIST Well, I'm assuming you'll be able to get that information and so that you can bring it in here next Thursday when we meet again. 

00:22:15
KAY So, you are assuming that I'm gonna tell him? 

00:22:20
DON That's right. I mean, you're assuming that she's gonna tell me. 

00:22:20
THERAPIST I'm assuming you'll have access to that information. 

00:22:25
DON I guess you're gonna have to tell me then. 

00:22:30
KAY Okay. So, wait a minute, does that mean, do you think I can get over this? 

00:22:40
THERAPIST Well, I think it's really important that we keep track. You keep a daily log of how many incidences occur in, in a day. 

00:22:50
DON Sort of like keeping track of how many times a dog pees in the house. You know, like, make a calendar. We can do that. 

00:22:55
KAY So, does that mean you're gonna take me? Does that mean you sign me up for a patient? 

00:23:00
THERAPIST That means I'll see you next week, Thursday at 5 o'clock. 

00:23:05
JAY HALEY The main reason for this ending of the first session is because therapist and supervisor are uncertain whether they can solve this difficult problem which has failed in other therapies. It was three interviews before a plan was derived which might succeed. Therefore, they define the situation as a consultation, offer a relevant task to determine how cooperative they are, and set a next appointment. 

00:23:30
KAY Okay. 

00:23:30
DON Alright. 

00:23:30
KAY Thank you. 

00:23:35
THERAPIST Mm-hmm. 

00:23:35
KAY I think. 

00:23:40
[sil.] 

00:23:40
Session Two 

00:23:40
THERAPIST What I want you to do this week is I want you to spend a little bit of time together each evening making up a list of what some of the consequences would be if this problem were solved. Now, this list should be at least ten items. I say ten items as a bare minimum. If you can stop of 50, don't stop at 15. But, I want you to consider some of the consequences if this is solved. Now, this list is important for you, and it's important for me as to whether or not I wanna solve this problem. Okay? 

00:24:20
KAY Okay. 

00:24:20
DON Do you still want us to keep track of the episodes? 

00:24:25
THERAPIST I'll let you decide that, and I'll support your decision. 

00:24:35
[sil.] 

00:24:35
Session Three 

00:24:35
JAY HALEY In this third session, the couple came in with two single spaced type written pages of consequences of what will happen if they get over the problem. This discussion took the hour. 

00:24:45
KAY Stop being untrustworthy. Apprehensive. I wouldn't have to lie. 

00:24:55
THERAPIST What are some of the implications of that, if you didn't have to lie? 

00:25:00
KAY I'd be able to be honest. I mean. 

00:25:00
THERAPIST What do you think that'd be like, if she didn't lie? If she were honest? 

00:25:05
DON Well, I could trust her. I mean, and, and there's a whole undercurrent that goes along with that surrounding the you know, food and eating. If I leave the room, I don't trust her. 

00:25:15
JAY HALEY The young woman is constantly preoccupied with her weight, and she weighs herself many times a day. To break up this aspect of the symptom, she is asked to stop weighing herself. To keep the husband involved, and make it a game, he is asked to weigh her and keep the weight from her. 

00:25:35
THERAPIST One of the things I'm thinking of having you do this week, Don, is I want you to weigh Kay on a daily basis. Now, you should make a chart, like you did the first week when I asked you to keep track of her vomiting, of what Kay weighs daily. And, I want you to not let her know what it is, what her weight is. 

00:26:00
DON That would be tough to do. 

00:26:00
THERAPIST Well, what I'm asking you to do is try , try an experiment. Try something different. 

00:26:05
DON Okay. 

00:26:05
THERAPIST And, I would ask you to not weigh yourself. 

00:26:10
DON I mean, I, I'd have to get down and cover the numbers. 

00:26:10
THERAPIST Well, however you wanna do it. 

00:26:15
DON I mean, you couldn't weigh yourself once I leave the room. 

00:26:15
THERAPIST You think you can do that? 

00:26:15
DON She can weigh herself at work. 

00:26:20
THERAPIST Well, what I'm asking you to do is to not weigh yourself anywhere, to not know your weight for one week. 

00:26:30
KAY Okay. 

00:26:30
THERAPIST Have you ever told her to cut it out? Stop it? This is it? 

00:26:35
DON An ultimatum? 

00:26:35
THERAPIST Kay, no more. I'm not gonna stand the vomiting. 

00:26:40
DON Not in those exact words. 

00:26:45
THERAPIST How did you do it in your exact words? 

00:26:45
KAY Well, there was a threat made. There was a, there was a threat. 

00:26:50
DON A semi-threat. I mean, it was somewhere, somewhere down the road, I'm probably gonna leave if this continues. Not tomorrow, not now. 

00:27:00
KAY But, there was a timeframe. I mean, it was, if the plumbing backs up one more time, then... 

00:27:10
THERAPIST So, I take it there was a problem with the plumbing. 

00:27:10
DON That's true. We literally had a basement full of vomit. I mean, I'm not kidding. It was this thick. I mean, it was disgusting. I thought it was just, um, some sort of sewage problem, you know. Garbage and accumulated debris. I had no idea it was that. It was disgusting. 

00:27:30
Session Four 

00:27:30
JAY HALEY When the couple came in the next week, she had not weighed herself, and he had kept her weight secret. 

00:27:40
THERAPIST Uh, it'll be two weeks before we get together again. 

00:27:45
KAY Right. 

00:27:45
THERAPIST Okay. Now, there's two things I'm gonna ask you to do within these next two weeks. The first one is gonna seem pretty minor, pretty insignificant. The second one will in fact solve the problem. Do you feel twinges in your stomach? 

00:28:05
KAY Just like that? 

00:28:05
THERAPIST Okay. So, first thing I wanna do is talk about the first one. On Saturday, Don, I want you to go on a tour. I want you to go to the Giant. Go to 7-11. Go to McDonald's. And I want you to buy that same lunch. And I want you to take that home. I want you to go in the kitchen, and I want the two of you to discuss one of two options that you may have. The first thing, the first option that you can do is that Kay eats everything. And you see to it, Don, that she eats all of it, down to the last Snicker bar, last Snickers bar, um, the last soda, that everything is consumed. Now, then after that, Kay, you can do whatever you want. I mean, you can vomit, do whatever you wanna do. Or, the two of you can decide to take that food and just throw it away. 

00:29:10
DON Just throw it in the garbage disposal and just shove it down there. 

00:29:15
THERAPIST Yeah, you can use the garbage disposal. These are the two ways you can throw away the food. One is through is Kay. Through your body. And the second is through the garbage disposal, the trash can, the toilet, however you wanna do it. Now, this is, in fact, the minor of the two things that I'm gonna ask you to do. 

00:29:35
JAY HALEY This directive was paradoxical. The client was being asked to do what she was there not to do. By having this husband supervisor her, there was a chance she would rebel against him and not binge. That is why the therapist to ask the husband to insist she finish all the food. The couple returned and reported that she ate all the food in her husband's presence and then went and threw up. She left two candy bars, and he did not insist she eat them. 

00:30:05
THERAPIST And the second thing that I'm gonna ask you to do is in essence the foundation for solving the problem. Now, in laying this foundation, it's important to me to know that both of you are committed to do this, to having this problem solved. And what that foundation is, without getting too detailed into what the solution will be, is that Kay, the next two weeks, you need to be, be completely totally, without fail, wholeheartedly host to Don about how many times you vomit in a day. 

00:30:45
JAY HALEY By this fourth session, the therapist and supervisor had a plan. They decided to use the guaranteed cure. In this procedure, the therapist tells the couple that he has secured this guarantee, and then he postpones telling them what it is. He puts them off for two weeks to think about it. When they come back to learn what the cure is, he talks about other matters. He ultimately gets to the cure after he's had them committed to it. 

00:31:15
THERAPIST Now, this issue of honesty has to be agreed upon right now, up front. So, Kay, can you be completely, totally, whole heartedly honest? 

00:31:30
KAY Yeah. But, how's anybody gonna know but me if I'm telling the truth or not? 

00:31:35
THERAPIST How am I gonna know? I'm not gonna know. That's why I'm asking you now. Can you be completely honest to Don? 

00:31:45
KAY I can promise. 

00:31:45
THERAPIST Can, can you be a little more emphatic about that promise? 

00:31:55
KAY I promise I will be. 

00:31:55
THERAPIST Okay. And, Don, in these next two weeks, you're to be very kind and very gentle. Um, I don't want your eyes to bug out on her when she comes to you and reports each night, and she gives a really big number. I don't want your pen to go through the paper in shock. You're to be very kind, very gentle. 

00:32:15
KAY So, it's part of the deal that he does not get mad at me? 

00:32:20
THERAPIST Well, you're to be very non-judgmental. And, you're to be very kind. 

00:32:25
KAY I'll be honest. 

00:32:25
DON I can be non-judgmental. 

00:32:30
THERAPIST Now, the important thing for you to realize is I don't want either one of you to do this unless you're totally, completely committed to having this problem solved, because I will guarantee you a solution when you come back in two weeks. But, if you're not ready for a solution, then that's all right. 

00:32:45
JAY HALEY This directive illustrates how live supervision can be important. The therapist says that he will guarantee a solution. He needs to say if you do what I say, I will guarantee a solution. The supervisor telephones him to make that correction to avoid any misunderstanding. 

00:33:05
THERAPIST I will guarantee you a solution if you do what I say and come back in two weeks. Sort of curious as to why you're tearing now. 

00:33:15
KAY I don't know. 

00:33:25
DON Do I really get angry with you? 

00:33:25
KAY Uh, I don't know. I don't know. No. No. 

00:33:35
DON No, I know I do. 

00:33:35
KAY I don't know. I just, I find it really hard to believe that I would just stop doing it. And that's a little bit frightening. I know that's a terrible word, but it is. It's just a little bit frightening. 

00:33:55
THERAPIST What is, what is frightening? 

00:34:00
KAY I can't believe this. I, I wanna stop doing it, but I must get something out of doing it, and I don't know what it would be like not to do it anymore. I don't know. I just, I'm just nervous, I guess. 

00:34:20
THERAPIST Well, I, I know you're upset, but I wanna say is that I will guarantee a solution if you do what I say. But, if you're not ready for a solution, if you don't, if you're not ready to have this problem solved yet, then that's fine. 

00:34:35
KAY No, I mean, it sounds so simple. I won't have a problem following your instructions exactly. I... 

00:34:45
THERAPIST Okay, but you know if you're not ready to have this problem solved, that's okay. 

00:34:50
KAY No, I want, I want to do it. I mean, it sounds great. It sounds wonderful. 

00:34:55
THERAPIST Okay. So, if you do what I say, this will be solved. 

00:35:00
KAY I'll do it. 

00:35:00
THERAPIST Okay. 

00:35:05
KAY Okay. 

00:35:05
Session Five 

00:35:05
THERAPIST Yeah, on Thursday, when you left here two weeks ago, the count was one, two, up to four. On Saturday it went to seven. The highest was at, was at seven. Kay. Okay. On, the following Saturday, you went back up to four. I guess what I'm kind of taken aback by here, is you had no more than seven when the average before was around eight, up to 25 times. I mean, that's why I let you take the graph to 35 times so you could have that many. 

00:35:45
KAY Sorry to disappoint you. 

00:35:50
THERAPIST Have the two of you talked much about today? 

00:35:50
DON We talk about this all the time. I mean, this whole cycle problem, question, you know, whatever you wanna call it. That could come out of anything at all. And we talked about this almost daily. Regarding today, there was this hesitancy and concern. You know, there's a concern about being elated before this. I think to be elated, um, you know, we talked about, we'd like to say that we'd walk out of here and somebody would wave a magic wand. It's been around a long time and, and, you said it's been around a long time, but for someone to say that it's finally gonna be over. I mean, I hope to heck it is. 

00:36:35
THERAPIST Well, I certainly don't believe in magic. 

00:36:40
KAY No, I understand, and. 

00:36:45
THERAPIST There's no magic. 

00:36:45
DON No, I, we understand that there's no pill to take. I mean, there's no magic. 

00:36:50
THERAPIST Okay. Now, one of the things that I told you guys last time that you were here, is that if you do what I say, this problem will be solved. 

00:36:55
DON I know. I know. We danced in the parking lot. 

00:37:00
KAY And that passed. 

00:37:05
THERAPIST What passed? 

00:37:05
KAY We're not excited. I'm not excited. 

00:37:10
DON You mean, if I think it were really ending, I'd get a twinge in my stomach. 

00:37:15
THERAPIST Okay. I guess what I'm asking you to do here is, I'm asking would you be committed to do whatever it takes? 

00:37:25
KAY Well, I mean what's the problem is we have been. 

00:37:30
THERAPIST Up, up to now you, you've, you've done what I've asked you to do. But, I think what I'm, what I'm talking about here is something different. 

00:37:35
DON Uh, we don't know what you're talking about though. 

00:37:40
KAY I've been honest. Those are completely true. 

00:37:45
THERAPIST Okay. Well, this, this is an accurate account of the number of times you've vomited in this last week? 

00:37:50
KAY Yes. 

00:37:55
THERAPIST Okay. You're both committed to do what I say to get over this problem? 

00:38:00
DON Sure, I mean, we want this to end, and we're committed to do anything to do that, but I mean, if the solution is our friend jumping off a bridge, I'm not committed to do that. I mean, I'm committed to do anything that's reasonable. I, I'm not gonna do anything, anything that's unreasonable. 

00:38:20
THERAPIST Okay. Well, I'd like the two of you to talk about this for a minute. I'd like you to really clarify between the two of you that you're both positive that you want this to end. 

00:38:30
KAY Well, we've both, I mean, we have talked about it, and we do, you know, I don't see anything negative that could come from this. 

00:38:40
THERAPIST Okay, what are some of the positive, you think, things you see evolving out of this being solved? 

00:38:45
DON I mean, it goes on and on and on. 

00:38:45
THERAPIST Have you been weighing yourself? 

00:38:50
DON I hid the scale. 

00:38:50
THERAPIST The scale the Don just hid, is that the one that you usually use to weigh yourself? 

00:38:55
KAY Well, he hasn't hidden it. I ask, asked him to put it away so that I wouldn't get on it. 

00:39:00
THERAPIST Okay. 

00:39:00
DON You probably know where it is. 

00:39:05
KAY I don't know where it is. I, I haven't weighed myself since, I haven't been on that scale since you asked, you told me "Don't weigh yourself at all." That length of time. 

00:39:15
THERAPIST Mm-hmm. Okay. Don, did you have a hard time, um, trying to be kind and non-judgmental when she's reported to you each evening. 

00:39:25
DON Neutral to nice. I mean, I, I don't think I was ever angry or anything. 

00:39:30
KAY Yeah. 

00:39:30
DON It would usually be a matter of jumping in bed and, and cuddling up or something. 

00:39:35
THERAPIST Afterwards? 

00:39:35
DON Yeah. 

00:39:35
THERAPIST That sounds nice. Is that something new? 

00:39:40
KAY I think that's a part of this. 

00:39:40
THERAPIST Now, one of the things that I do want to make crystal clear about today is that you're not to discuss this with anybody. Um, whatever we discuss in here, you're not to discuss with anybody else. You can talk, you can say that the problem is solved, but you can't say how it is solved. 

00:40:05
KAY That's a deal. 

00:40:05
THERAPIST Okay. 

00:40:05
KAY I'll do that. 

00:40:05
THERAPIST Okay, that, under any circumstances, you will not tell anybody. Okay. Now, there have been times when you've had three or four days, episodes of three or four days of throwing, you know, one or two. Um, would you be satisfied, do you consider that normal now? For, for a day? Well, if the graph looked like this from now on, would you consider this problem solved? 

00:40:40
DON As compared to what? I mean, I don't think typically done three to five a day. 

00:40:45
KAY Answer the question. 

00:40:50
DON All right. No. I would like to see this problem solved. I mean, I don't think you can have a little bit of a problem like being a little bit pregnant. 

00:40:55
THERAPIST Okay. How about you, Kay? 

00:41:00
KAY No. I mean, what if I were to stay like that? 

00:41:05
THERAPIST Yeah. What if the graph was to stay like this from May, June, would you consider this problem over? 

00:41:10
KAY No, I would say no. My idea was , I would prefer to eliminate this completely. I, I'm not happy with it. I don't... 

00:41:25
THERAPIST Okay. Then, what I'm gonna ask you to do today is something that you both have to be committed to. I mean, this is, this is not your problem. This is not your problem. This is your problem. 

00:41:40
KAY Well, I'd be lying if I said I thought it was both our problems. I mean, it is just my problem. I mean, this is it, right? This is what I'm supposed to agree? No, no. I, I don't agree. I think this is just my problem. 

00:42:00
THERAPIST But, you think Don has affected... 

00:42:00
KAY Right. Greatly, yes. 

00:42:00
THERAPIST Okay, in an abnormal way? 

00:42:05
KAY Whatever that means, yes. 

00:42:05
THERAPIST Okay. And are you committed to wanting it resolved? 

00:42:10
KAY Yes. But, it does make me nervous. I mean, I know I get, I get apprehensive when I think about not doing anymore, but at the same time I don't, I don't want to do it anymore. 

00:42:30
THERAPIST Okay, so what I'm gonna ask you to do today, you're committed to totally. 

00:42:35
KAY I'd say yes, but I mean, if it's something totally crazy, I don't know. 

00:42:40
THERAPIST Okay. Well, what I'm gonna ask you to do today, I want you both to be committed to totally and wholeheartedly. I want you two to talk about this for a minute, cuz if there's any problems about this, I just want you to make sure you're both ready to have this problem solved. And, if you're not ready to have it solved today, that's okay. I'm not going anywhere. We can come back another day. 

00:43:05
DON Yeah. The fact is we both want it to end. 

00:43:10
KAY Mm-hmm. Why wait for another day? I mean... 

00:43:15
DON I, I think we're committed to that. We, we both want it to end. 

00:43:15
KAY Mm-hmm. But, I'm not, I'm not committed to taking off my clothes, you know, and running down the street or... 

00:43:25
THERAPIST I can assure you, it's not gonna violate any moral values you may have. 

00:43:30
KAY I'm not being critical or anything. I just, you just, you have a way, I mean, I'm half afraid, you know, of whatever it is that, that you want us to do. 

00:43:45
DON I mean, is it gonna be any worse than anything we've done before? 

00:43:50
KAY I don't mean to add it as a criticism. 

00:43:50
THERAPIST I certainly didn't take it that way. 

00:43:55
KAY It's just, you know, it's the same as, um, all the consequences from not doing it. After all the talking about it, it just started to sound so ominous and foreboding. I'm just half afraid that I'm gonna have to do something that's like really embarrassing. 

00:44:20
DON Uh, I mean, there's also a fear of it not working. 

00:44:25
THERAPIST Okay, well, secrecy(ph) is certainly a, an issue here. This is really just between the tree of us. 

00:44:30
KAY Or of the four of us. 

00:44:30
JAY HALEY She is referring to the one way mirror and to the supervisor behind it, who has made a number of telephone calls. 

00:44:40
KAY I mean, I'm very much committed to doing whatever it is, but I'm half afraid of what it is. I can't even talk. 

00:44:55
DON I mean, is it something we're capable of, of doing? 

00:44:55
THERAPIST Well, it's something you're both capable of doing, of course. 

00:45:00
KAY So, okay. Yeah. I think we both are completely committed, but I say we're also a little afraid of what it is. 

00:45:20
DON And concerned, apprehensive. I mean, what if I let down my end of it. I don't even know what we're gonna do, and I don't wanna let Kay down. 

00:45:30
THERAPIST So you're committed to doing what I say? 

00:45:30
KAY Yeah. 

00:45:35
DON Yeah. 

00:45:35
KAY Why, I can say yes, but if it's something terrible, then I might back out. I mean, so how can you trust me? I don't, I, um, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Yeah. 

00:46:00
THERAPIST Don? 

00:46:00
DON I feel like I'm buying a paper bag here. Um, sure, that's the biggest problem sitting here for the past few weeks is that I don't know what I'm gonna have to do. And, um, but, I, I'm committed to, to see this end. I'm committed to do whatever it takes. 

00:46:25
THERAPIST Okay. So, it'll be important that we get together again next Thursday. Any problems with that? 

00:46:30
KAY No problem. 

00:46:30
THERAPIST Okay. 

00:46:35
JAY HALEY The viewer might not approve the tasks given to these couples. The point of this film is not how to do a particular task, but how to motivate people to follow suggestions. This couple would now do almost anything asked of them. 

00:46:50
THERAPIST What I want the both of you to do is the next time that you vomit, both of you are to give me a penny for me to do with as I see fit. 

00:47:10
[sil.] 

00:47:10
KAY Okay. 

00:47:15
DON Okay. 

00:47:15
THERAPIST Are we agreed upon this? That the next time that you vomit, be it tonight, you can go out to dinner. You can go to McDonald's. The next time you vomit, you're to both to give me a penny to do with as I see fit. 

00:47:30
KAY Okay. 

00:47:35
THERAPIST Okay. One penny that you are jointly to give me. 

00:47:40
DON So, two penny. 

00:47:45
THERAPIST No, one penny the two of you are to jointly give me. 

00:47:45
DON Oh, I thought it was a condition. 

00:47:45
THERAPIST That I will, that I will do with as I see fit. The second time Kay vomits, the two of you are two give me two pennies. 

00:47:55
DON Okay. 

00:48:00
THERAPIST And again, I will use this money as I see fit. Now, the third time that you vomit, I want four pennies, and again this is for me to use. And I want cash. I'm not interested in checks. I want cash brought here next Thursday at six o'clock. Now, the fourth time that you vomit, you're to give me eight pennies. Eight cents. And again, this is money that I'm to do with as I see fit. As I said before, this is independent of your fee for coming here. This is not the institute's money. And you will not have any say in how I choose to spend this money. So, are we agreed upon that? Okay. Now, let's get definitions of, a definitions of terms here. Vomit is anything that comes out of your stomach, be it voluntary or involuntary, whether it's forced or not forced. I mean, you can get sick next week... 

00:49:05
JAY HALEY In this case, there was an interesting collaboration between therapist and supervisor. The supervisor had done this directive before, using dollars. He was concerned that the young woman might not be able to stop vomiting quickly enough, and it would cost a lot of money. The therapist suggested using pennies, since the principle was the same, and that was done. 

00:49:30
THERAPIST So, let's review. First time you vomit, you're to give me one penny. The second time Kay vomits, you're to give me two pennies. You're to double that. The third time Kay vomits, you're to double that two pennies to four pennies. And that doubling will continue on at that rate and you will bring that cash next Thursday here at six o'clock. 

00:50:00
DON So, it's just doubling and doubling and doubling. 

00:50:00
THERAPIST Right. 

00:50:00
DON Okay. 

00:50:05
THERAPIST Well, I'll see you at six o'clock next Thursday. So, we're both clear on this? Do you have any questions, Don? 

00:50:15
DON So, basically Kay has to be honest. 

00:50:20
THERAPIST Any questions, Kay? 

00:50:25
KAY Okay. 

00:50:30
THERAPIST Okay. 

00:50:30
KAY We'll do that. 

00:50:30
THERAPIST I want that money, whatever it is, in cash, brought here six o'clock, next Thursday. Now, I just, I just wanna say, I know you're both honest people, and that I'll see you next Thursday at six o'clock. 

00:50:50
DON Okay. 

00:50:55
THERAPIST Okay. 

00:50:55
DON We can do that part. Thank you. 

00:51:00
KAY Thank you. 

00:51:00
DON Thank you very much. 

00:51:05
[sil.] 

00:51:05
Session Six 

00:51:05
KAY Here's one dollar and 28 cents. 

00:51:15
THERAPIST That's all? 

00:51:15
KAY Well, we didn't realize how quickly it doubled, and so we went home and wrote it down so we would know. And then we figured it out. 

00:51:25
JAY HALEY As few as eleven vomits would cost them over a thousand dollars, and then two thousand, and then four thousand, and so on. If she continued to vomit, the couple would be bankrupt from doing what they agreed. One should keep in mind that the agreement was that the therapist could do with the money what he saw fit. If necessary, he could give it back. Fortunately that issue did not arise. 

00:51:50
THERAPIST You know that this doubling doesn't end today. 

00:51:55
KAY I know. 

00:51:55
DON Yeah, we know. 

00:51:55
THERAPIST Okay. This doubling is gonna continue. Life expectancy in the late 80's, that's another 64, 65 years. And I know one of the things that could happen in that time, is you could have a relapse. 

00:52:05
KAY I'm not worried about that happening. I mean, if or when that happens, then I'll worry about it. 

00:52:10
THERAPIST Okay. Because, I, I would look forward to that happening. There's a lot of things I'd like to do with that money. 

00:52:20
KAY Me too.

Session Seven 

00:52:25
THERAPIST Where's the chart? 

00:52:30
DON We didn't circle it because Kay just did it today. 

00:52:35
THERAPIST And this is the ninth one that we're up to? 

00:52:40
KAY Yes. Mm-hmm. 

00:52:40
THERAPIST Have you been? 

00:52:40
KAY Nope. 

00:52:45
DON She has a totally different outlook on her job, on the way she looks. Um, she's changing. I'm very happy with the way things are going. 

00:52:55
KAY Thank you.

Session Eight 

00:52:55
JAY HALEY The couple went over the list of consequences that would occur if she gave up the problem. 

00:53:05
THERAPIST It says Don would be more proud of Kay. 

00:53:10
KAY Are you? 

00:53:10
DON Actually, I am. 

00:53:10
THERAPIST Has that occurred? 

00:53:10
DON Uh, it has occurred already. 

00:53:15
THERAPIST Okay, because you were beaming last week. 

00:53:15
DON I, she's been to, she's been to Denver on a business trip. She got promoted. 

00:53:20
KAY My boss was wrong. And, um, I called him, and I told him I wanted to talk to him. And, we went over to his house. I was a hotshot. 

00:53:35
DON She had everything working properly. 

00:53:35
KAY My heart was going like this. 

00:53:40
THERAPIST And you were a hotshot. 

00:53:40
KAY A little. 

00:53:45
DON Well, unless I've been misled, I think we're 100 percent. 

00:53:55
JAY HALEY The therapist saw this couple once a month for six months to make sure the improvement continued. Then the therapy ended with an emotional farewell. Six months later there was a followup. And there had been positive results. The wife had stopped vomiting and was more self confident. The husband was more sure of himself and more substantial. The therapist had learned a new technique in therapy.
