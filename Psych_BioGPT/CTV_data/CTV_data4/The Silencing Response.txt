ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Just remember, the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in your Trauma Recovery right now. Those who spend time everyday to harness calm, do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is the silencing response. When I was a graduate student, I began to think and write about a little known phenomena known as the silencing response, which was based on some research conducted in the early '70s on psychiatrists who were meeting with Holocaust survivors. Apparently they concluded that the stories were so horrific, it would be best not to address the concerns. What we later learnt is that this sent a message that what the individual experience was not important to not to be addressed, that they were not believe(ph) or that there was nothing that could help to relieve them of their terrible burn. Working for your trauma and through our trauma history can free us up from the heavy load that trauma can leave(ph) us with. Expressing the story, sharing our life, being honest to others feelings can help us and those who are around as well. Although it might seem like the worst, we should talk about it. Not talking about it is like the worse. As we are then left with no outlet and can feel like we are living in a pressure cooker. Especially if the story is shameful, leaving us with the sensation that we are terrible or unworthy or unlovable or any other negative self-talk we might be struggling with. One client admitted to me that it wasn't until he began speaking about and truly admitting to his childhood abuse. Then he began to truly like himself and appreciate how strong he had to be to endure this tramautic history. He no longer felt shame, he no longer blamed himself, he no longer isolated himself and he became better able to focus up work and manage all of his personal relationships. This was his breakthrough point in recovery. Let's practice together. One, find one way to share your story for the trusted person. This might be a family member, friend, a therapist or maybe even a community that you gather with. Two, let out little at a time to test the waters. "Is this a safe place for me to express my concerns, my thoughts and my memories?" If yes, share a little bit more each day, ensuring that you can share safely and feel the support. If you notice that you need more skilled care, seek out a trained trauma professional to help you with the next steps in the journey of breaking through the silence. Practice this again throughout the day whenever you need to recapture feelings of comfort or calm. Take the time right now to form a new healthy practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky, from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
