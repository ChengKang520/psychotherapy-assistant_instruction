"Treatment and Intervention with Latinos" - Guilermo Bernal, Ph.D. 

00:00:00
State of the Art and Science on Psychosocial Treatments with Adult Latinos 

00:00:20
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Um, I've titled this, uh, State of the Art and Science on Psychosocial Treatments with Adult Latinos. So, I'm not going to be talking about kids, uh, at all. Um, and, uh, in the list of, uh, folks that are sort of co-presenters is the basically the research team that we've had operational since, uh, early in the summer working on, uh, on the reviews that we're carrying out. Um, so I'm gonna be talking a little bit about multiculturalism and Psychotherapy, some basic demographics which is going to be real quick because that's been discovered already by, uh, Alfonso (?? ). Uh, and then some of the reviews that have been conducted, um, in the past on Latinos and Latinas in treatment research. Uh, the early critiques, some of the method of how we developed the method of procedures for the review, and then we're going to move into the effectiveness and efficacy of psychosocial treatments, uh, and update on the state of the, uh, art and science with adult Latinos and some preliminary conclusions. 

00:01:25
Multiculturalism & Psychotherapy 

00:01:30
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. So, this is a quote that I like a lot from, uh, Julien Comas-Diaz, and she says that "Although multiculturalism has reached mainstream institutions, psychotherapy has been slow to respond to cultural phenomenon. For example, therapeutic themes such as family relations, interpersonal boundaries, emotional space, intimacy, relationships and identity are culturally embedded. Lamentably, mainstream psychotherapy seldom reflects cultural variability or analyzes power and privilege. Moreover, psychotherapy can be ethnocentric, decontextualized, ahistorical and apolitical." 

00:02:00
U.S. Racial and Ethnic Minorities 

00:02:05
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. And, uh, well, as you know, 33 percent of the US population identifies racial ethnic minority, uh, 44 percent of youth identify as racial or ethnic minority, the white population is increasing much slower than, uh, ethnocultural groups. They stopped using the term minority, I don't know how that got in here, thanks to Joseph Trimble, who convinced me after a long debate, that I should stop using that term. From now I'm using ethno-cultural groups. And there is considerable heterogeneity that exists between and within minority groups that we're already been discussing in today's... 

00:02:30
Latinos/Hispanics 

00:02:35
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Latinos, you know, um, there are 73 million Latinos , 21 percent of the population, that may be a little bit old. It's a rapidly, uh, growing population, and it's predominantly young, uh, poor health outcomes and treatment remains less likely to be, to obtain appropriate depression care. Most, most Latinos are less likely to get, uh, care. Now, this is a, uh, little experiment that I did that anybody can repeat with basically similar to about Joseph presented, I think, in one of his slides. But here I used, I paired two terms, effectiveness with psychotherapy or with treatment, and what we find for all groups, this is in the psych info database, is that when you pair psychotherapy with either, uh, with effectiveness, um, you get 10,396 hits. When you put the term minority in, you get 106 hits. African Americans, 63, Asian Americans 26, Latinos 48, and American Indians 14. When you do that for treatment, uh, then you get 40,000 hits for all groups, and you can see the numbers later on there. Um, so you see that, uh, and this is, this is just with any field, this is not that they're discussing in depth paper on treatment and on psychotherapy or on, uh, with Latinos. This is just anywhere in the, uh, in the article that these two terms could be paired. So, we have there's a dirth of literature in the area of treatment research. 

00:04:15
Minorities and Psychotherapy 

00:04:20
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. So, in 2001, there were two really, uh, critiques that were published, one was by myself, uh, Bernal & Scharron-del-Rio where we argued that, uh, contemporary psychotherapy lacked ecological validity and thus was unresponsive to the needs of ethno-cultural groups. And also, um, Nakayama Hall, um, published a paper, similar paper that same year in consulting clinical psychology, that no adequate evidence that empirically supported therapies are effective with ethnic, uh, minorities, and that was a really strong statement and was suggesting that psychotherapy codified for culturally appropriateness, with ethno-cultural groups, provided and, and he also provided a conceptual approach focusing on interdependence, spirituality, discrimination, uh, and in developing culturally sensitive treatments. Um, now, the issue about diversity in the trials have already been discussed, fortunately, by Alfy, and we have less than half of the studies provided complete. 

00:05:25
Diversity in NIMH Clinical Trials 

00:05:25
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Um, information about ethnicity and race, um, ethnic minority groups, except African Americans were underrepresented, and the representation was not, has not improved over the last decade. Subgroup analysis by specific ethnic groups were very infrequently reported with very small sample sizes from which you really cannot make any completions or determinations. 

00:05:45
Reviews of Treatment Research 

00:05:50
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Now, in terms of being Latinos, research on Latinos and the treatments studies with Latinos, there was one meta-analysis conducted in Spanish, um, by Ana Navarro, and that was published in the Journal of Inter-American psychology, 1993. She identified 15 studies between 1970 and 1986, 11 of the 15 worked with children and adolescents, and 57 percent of the studies conducted therapy in Spanish. The effect size of these studies, however, ranged from zero to 2.75. Um... 

00:06:20
Review of Treatment (cont.) 

00:06:25
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Then, uh, a few years later, uh, Jenie Miranda and myself, along with Ana Lau, uh, Kohn Hwand and LaFromboise did a narrative review n the literature on ethnic minority treatment studies and, uh, there were actually very few studies, uh, on Latinos, particularly on adult Latinos. Um, for depression there were two studies that were identified in that review, both studies were actually culturally adapted with the, uh, original, um, Comas-Diaz's paper in 1981 where she looked at cognitive behavioral therapy. Um, in group and individual form compares to a placebo, to a control group. And then a study by Spinelli and Endicott which I'll talk to you about later, no studies on anxiety were identified, and there was one study on psychotic disorders, and it was culturally adapted and that was the (?? ) study in 1995. Now, we were talking earlier about issues of spirituality and religion and you may not know that despite the literature or the psychotherapy or the treatment outcome, uh, research, uh, literature, we actually have a Bible for this field, and the Bible is the Handbook of Psychotherapy and Behavior Change. Now, this, this is a major, uh, volume that gets published around every, uh, seven or eight or sometimes 10 years, and the 204, uh, publication which was actually edited by Michael Lambert, uh, there was a, um, a wonderful article by, uh, Nolan Zane, who I don't know where he's in know because he stepped out of the room for my presentation interestingly enough, and um, so he, he did, he did a review with, uh, Stanley Su. He did a review of basically the literature for all of the minority groups. However, when the 2013 publication, the update of the handbook of our Bible, uh, there was no chapter on diversity, no chapter on ethnic minorities, uh, and what I've heard from the grapevine was that apparently Lambert believed that there was not enough progress made in, in psychotherapy research, uh, to warrant, uh, a, uh, a chapter on this theme, and I'm here to prove him wrong. So is Alfy. 

00:08:45
Progress, Challenges, and Hope 

00:08:45
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. ]So, so um, so there's been some progress in the past eight years, there are important challenges and there's hope, uh, in the generation of new knowledge, yet the research continues to lag behind, certainly it's not at all in proportion to the, uh, to the base rate of the population. 

00:09:05
Method 

00:09:05
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. So, our method was to, um, essentially do the computer searches on online bibliographic databases such as Psych info, uh, EBSCO host, PubMed, Web of Knowledge. Scielo is a database for, uh, Spanish, uh, Latin American and Spanish speaking publications, Dialnet, Cochrane and the Science Direct, and we used a number of key words to try to tap into the, uh, the um, the treatment studies that we're interested in. Um, and we also did some direct contact with some authors, uh, we identified 318 studies that met the initial criteria. We were also looking for intervention and prevention studies, for effectiveness trials, for studies conducted specifically with Latino or Hispanics, uh, examining psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, the combination. 

00:10:00
Method (cont.) 

00:10:00
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. We also included additional criteria for the literature review that presented a control or comparison group. We could have, we could, we were also looking for randomized trials, for open trials and also for the naturalistic analogs. Uh, they had to have at least pre-post measures, uh, there was also a second process of data cleaning and review of articles where we wanted to have at least, studies that had at least 40 percent of the samples be, uh, Latinos. Um, that reduced the number of studies to 34. Uh, and we had the team of graduate and undergraduate students that were helping me with the identification of data cleaning and setting up the databases. So now, I'm gonna go through, not in detail, all of these, unless we have until 6:00. But, um, here is the list of, uh, of the preliminary studies, uh, the blue is for, uh, of course depression, uh, and so I'll be changing the color for the different conditions that we... So we had a study by Araya who, actually is one of the articles that was very interesting because it was done with primary care context in cheating. 240 participants and they got randomized to a step care condition or a usual care treatment and they found, actually, very positive effects for the step care. So, this is more effectiveness study. Aleana and Miranda in 1981 did a very interesting study on low income minority primary care patients for depression, and they had, uh, phone CBT against a usual care condition. Um, no significant differences were found between the conditions, interestingly enough on the mean pre-treatment, um, scores, uh, of the demographic information. Um, there were, um, um, and that's, that's an interesting point because, uh, not finding that, those kinds of differences, uh, it, it's fully and fully 26 cases. But let me move on so that we can, this is the Comas-Diaz paper that I mentioned to you before which is, like, one of the first studies on CBT that was done with Latinos, and the Dwight Johnson and, and uh, their group, uh, did a study of Latino patients in a rural family medical center, who met criteria for MDD, and they used now, patients with phone, uh, contact and CBT and they found that the CBT in the phone was more likely, uh, to experience improvement in depression scores over the six month, uh, follow up. Um, the Ell study is a very interesting study because it looked at oncology patients with MDD. The conditions was a one year depression care manager and PTST and, uh, anti-depressant medication, and they found that patients in, in the interview group, in their intervention group improved significantly over the ones in the control group. Fernandez, Mendes, Lumgo, Garcia, this was a study, uh, with, uh, 216 patients, actually it was done in a Estudius, Spain where they, um, basically, uh, this is one of the only studies I've seen where they actually selected at random, the population from these clinics and then randomized two different conditions. Uh, they had a, uh, brief therapy, uh, and versus a usual care condition, and they found that the brief therapy was more effective than usual care. Uh, what we know from the psychotherapy literature is that something is usually better than nothing. Usual care sometimes is almost like nothing, um, so that's an interesting point. The Gallagher Thompson Gray study was middle aged older women uh, with non-Hispanic white and Hispanic, uh, women, uh, and they were working essentially with, uh, um, a condition called coping with care, and telephone support. The coping with care is they were working with, um, adult caregivers and they were working with Alzheimer patients. So, those in the coping with care showed greater improvement over the from pre to post intervention than those in the, uh, telephone support condition, which was their usual care. Then, uh, Alejandro Iterian did a very interesting study of basically 15 patients. This was a, um, an open trial with a culturally adapted CBT with one hour sessions on a weekly basis, and they found significant reductions from pre to post, uh, in this, uh, open trial study for both anxious and somatic symptoms, anxiety and somatic symptoms. Then another study, and these are all supposedly and hopefully in alphabetical order, uh, the Iterian, another study by Alejandro Iterian with 50 Latinos. Uh, this is in the Jersey area, uh, where they were looking at the SM diagnosis and they were examining, essentially, um, motivational enhancement therapy for anti-depressant medication versus a usual care condition. And again, they found that the, uh, motivational enhancement therapy was superior to the usual care. The Kantor study, this is out of, uh, Milwaukee, uh, Wisconsin, they're doing behavioral activation intervention, was one of the few behavioral activation interventions. Jonathan Kantor and, uh, Asara Santiago, uh, initiated this project, uh, with Latinos in Milwaukee. There's a large Latino community in Milwaukee. And they were essentially looking at 12 sessions of behavior activation for Latinos and was culturally adapted. Uh, the results provided some very important preliminary results. They've already completed an RCT on this, but the RCT is not published. Uh, it was culturally adapted intervention as well. The Le study is the Latina women with low SES level from Central America, and meeting certain demographic criteria, the condition was usual care. Or, eight weeks of group intervention during pregnancy and three individual booster sessions during post partum. Uh, so they intended to treat analysis and they shows that patients in CBT had lower depressive symptoms and fewer cases of moderate depression at post. The Lesser study, uh, is with, uh, African Americans and with whites and with Hispanics, and this was using the, um, this is basically the star D study. I don't know how many of you are familiar with the star D. The star D was a huge, um, investment from NIH about $40 million dollars, and this phenomenal study to look at the sequencing of, uh, different, um, um, medications in the treatment of depression in, I don't know how many sites, I forget how many sites they were in the United States. Um, and um, essentially, they, this is a secondary of the original database, of the original studies, which actually did not, there's a lot of controversy over the study. Uh, but they found measure differences at baseline demographics and clinical variables with the black and the Hispanic, uh, participants in this study. And they found them to be more social advantages with greater ability than whites. However, when they adjust it, uh, for for these variables, then the outcomes, uh, uh, equalized. It's interesting cause you have to adjust for the initial, uh, variance and then of course you find that they are the same at the, uh, uh, on the basis of outcome. But that's another story. Then we have Lewis, Fernandes who did a study very similar to what Iterian did on, um, on motivation for anti-depressant medication, and sure enough they found that patients stayed in motivational, uh, received the motivational stage longer in therapy and had better outcomes than the ones, and better quality of life, uh, than those, uh, from base, from the base line. Miranda, Azocar and Orgavista did a, this is a well-known study of 250 patients, uh, they had a CBT condition plus clinical care management, against a CBT condition alone, and they found that, uh, patients in CBT plus the clinical, uh, care management, uh, improved, uh, more in terms of, uh, symptoms of depression, uh, and other levels of functioning than the regular CBT alone. Um, they of course did a number of, uh, tweaking to the, uh, to the intervention because it was geared toward lower SES, uh, patients. Um, Miranda, Green, Krupernick. This is another large study of SES women who received, uh, county mental health service in the DC area, and here the additions as essentially medication versus individual group CBT versus community referral, and sure enough, uh, well we've been, women who were seeking treatment and screened for depression had rapid reductions in depression symptoms both ADM and CBT were superior to the community referral. And the Organista Marluz paper is a 1994 paper. This is essentially most an open trail that was conducted with, uh, at the, uh, hospital depression clinic with, uh, medical, uh, essentially medical patients. Um, and they were looking at, uh, dropouts and whether folks could really engage and remain in treatment. And sure enough, they found that those who were involved in the Latino clinic had good outcomes and reduced their, uh, were able to stay in therapy much longer than the ones who, who were not referred to the clinic. Uh, Spinelli, Endicott, Leon et al. This was an English and Spanish speaking women, uh, during, uh, between the 12th and 33 weeks of gestation, ages 18 to, uh, 45. It's a 12 week bilingual parallel designed control trial of IPT, interpersonal psychotherapy for anti-partum depression for, in comparison to a pair and control group, and they essentially, what they found was it replicated, or they say they replicated, uh, a report that replicated the findings for IBT, um, being beneficial for anti-partum depression, but they found no differences between the parent education control and the IBT in this one study. Uh, then this is a study by Veira out of the medical school at the University of Puerto Rico, and she did a very interesting study on patients with, uh, major depression. Uh, a large, they screened a whole lot of studies, patients, who were screened for depression. They were looking at the collaborative care model, and enhanced, uh, collaboration with physicians um, mental health staff and so forth, in comparison to the usual care condition. And sure enough, the uh, collaborative care condition significantly reduced depressive symptoms, um, and improved social functioning in six, uh, months after randomization. Then we have the large, uh, Wells, uh, et al, the partners in care at large study that was conducted with actually randomized clinics, uh, in two conditions of, uh, quality improvement, uh, medications. They basically had, uh, uh, usual care or one of two quality improvement programs, one of these was, uh, ADM, you know anti-depressant medications, um, with support. Or, quality improvement therapy, uh, and CBT. And they found, uh, impressive results in terms of the quality improvement for the medication and quality improvement for the therapy relative to the usual care. 

00:21:55
Criteria for Well Established of Efficacious Treatments 

00:22:00
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Um, so let me remind folks what's the criteria for well established, efficacious treatments. Uh, essentially at least two group test designs conducted by two different investigators, demonstrating efficacy in one of the following ways, superior to pill or psychological or placebo or another treatment, or equivalent to an already established treatment in studies with adequate statistical power. 

00:22:20
Summary of Depression Studies 

00:22:25
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. So, with that said, um, we have 20 studies on depression, uh, in terms of CBT efficacy, we have the Arean and Miranda paper of 1996. We have the Comas-Diaz paper, we have the Dwight Johnson paper, we have the Miranda et al paper abbout CBT plus case management versus CBT alone. There's also a psychoeducational paper by, uh, Araya. There's a combination anti-depressant medication and problem solving therapy. I thought I was going to forget some of these acronyms. With problems solving therapies in the El study, and the brief therapy by, uh, Fernandez-Mendez. 

00:23:00
Summary of Depression 

00:23:05
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. So, there's also the coping with care by Gallagher and a number of open trials, uh, here, which I think is very interesting because the open trials lead to the RCTs. Uh, so in terms of efficacy, uh, we have the Spinelli trial, IBT versus parenting education, both at equal benefits for post-partum, we have the effectiveness trial of Lesser, and then the Miranda et al ADM plus individual CBT, uh, group CBT. We have an RCT by, uh, Vera, uh, the collaborative care versus UC with depression and medical conditions, and we have the quality improvement study that had a large population or section of, uh, of uh, Latinos in that study. So, based on the criteria for determining well established or efficacious treatments, we can determine that CBT as a well-established efficacious treatment for Latinos because we now, we have at least, we have more that two studies from different research teams that meet the criteria that I mentioned before, and um, it's interesting to note that 14 out of 21 efficacy trials have been culturally adapted. That's not counting the two, the one study from Chile and the one study from Spain that we don't really consider to be culturally adapted, but it was, they're clearly done in Spanish and done by Spanish speaking providers, um, and so we're so, anyway. So that's something we can discuss later. So, there's strong evidence that combination of CBT and ADM yields positive result. We can't say that it's a well-established treatment, but and also promising treatments are behavioral activation and motivational intervening for, uh, for interventions. 

00:24:45
Meta-analytic Reviews on Depression 

00:24:45
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Here is a, uh, phenomenal or really nice, um, meta-analysis, one conducted by Culpers. He looked at CBT and adult MDD, had 150 studies and the meta-analysis was a .71 effect size, and they made a, what's nice about the paper is they make quite a point about the publication bias, and the quality of the study which they took into effect and rated that and took it into effect, which meant that they reduced the, when you do that, you reduce the effect size, uh, the size of the effect size to be redundant. Uh, they felt no evidence that CBT was superior to ADM rather psychotherapy when they took that into account. But this basically with the mainstream studies, uh, that have very little diversity in them. Um, but I use it as an anchor for we've been, for what we're finding. The second point of comparison had 10 RCTs, looked at ADM, looked at psychotherapy and their combination and found that the combo superior to anti-depressant medication or to psychotherapy alone. Just like what we were debating in the field about this. Then there's a whole Hollon, Steve Hollon's 2010, uh, study which is actually a, uh, delight to read, uh, with 125 randomized clinical trials. Um, they have, uh, basically there's, they're saying that CBT, IBT and behavioral, uh, therapy are, uh, efficacious for MDD. He's also concluding that emotionally focused therapy are possibly efficacious for MDD, and Van Loor's ABTs are efficacious or more enduring than, uh, anti-depressant medication. Now, this is another meta-analysis conducted by Van Loon. This is a, uh, team out of, uh, the Netherlands, and they're, this is the only study that has looked at, uh, published this year as well, they looked at nine RCTs, the effect size was .09, and they were looking at cultural adaptations of studies looking uh, at depression with adults. And the effect size was 1.09, 1.06. Uh, when you looked at it, we looked at that in comparison to the other, what we've seen with the other studies that have been culturally adapted, the other studies that have been culturally adapted range from .46 to .47 or whatever and the one with for adults, or for the general population. Uh, with the exception of adolescents, had a lower, in the 30s, uh, effect size. 

00:27:20
Treatment Research with Latinos 

00:27:25
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. So, moving on to anxiety, there are a lot less studies with anxiety. Here's the Hinton study for anxiety at 24 patients, and they were randomized to receive, uh, culturally adapted CBT or AMR. AMR is, uh, I forgot what the A is, but the other part is muscle relaxation. Um, so it's a muscle relaxation, uh, intervention. Um, and they found, uh, effect estimates showed a very large reduction for in PTSD, for symptoms, pre-treatment and post-treatments in favor of the, uh, culturally adapted intervention. And only modest improvements for the, uh, for the AMR uh, muscle relaxation, uh, it's like progressive muscle relaxation for Latinos with PTSD. The Jeffreys study is one that I really had my doubts whether to include or not, uh, because this is a large uh, it's, this is something like an analog to a, uh, to a clinical trial of sorts because they basically, uh, what's happened is that the VA has really revamped the way that they do their treatment and everything is computerized, uh, and their whole system is, uh, uh, they're doing evaluations pre and at post, uh, and they have this system, but what Jeffreys did is they looked at, uh, chart reviews. They looked, essentially we had a chart review study. When I think of chart review studies, I think nah, this is no good, don't even think about it, because it reminds me of the, uh, of the uh, original studies of, uh, of chart reviews of the, uh, Berlin done by, uh, um, that became such a controversy in the field of psychotherapy research. So, uh, but then when I looked at the study in detail, I realized this was really done with quite a bite of care because they had manualized, uh, prolonged exposure intervention. They had manualized cognitive processing therapy interventions. They had the very very careful procedures for evaluating from pre to post. What they, they found that they looked at Vets from 23-77, they had them in 43, uh, in all they had a large sector of Latinos involved in it, and they found no difference between Hispanics and whites in response to either CPT, cognitive processing therapy or prolonged exposure. Both CPT and prolonged exposure significantly reduced PTSD symptoms, prolonged exposure was more effective than CPT, uh, and the, the effect is there as you can see. The other study is Perez, Gomez et al, and these were patients, um, it's not eight to 65, that's, I thought I corrected that typo. Uh, but, um, I didn't, and I don't remember what the age is, but it's something in the 30s to 65. This is an open trial of CBT for PTSD and somatization. The treatment included 10 to 14 subjects of CBT uh, for both PTSD and somatization, and both treatments were effective small to moderate effect sizes were found. Um, the Rodriguez, Biglieri et al was also a small, uh, open trial, actually no, it was a randomized trial where, uh, they either got meta-cognitive therapy or prolonged exposure. And they found that both meta-cognitive therapy and prolonged exposure were effective in the treatment of OCD, and reduced significant, and produced significant decreases in symptoms, combined with depression. And here's another study by Mildred Vera out of the, um, medical sciences campus at UPR. And this was a, uh, small, uh, randomized trial of working patients, uh, for PTSD where they went either prolonged exposure or usual care and they found that treatment in prolonged exposure group demonstrated significantly greater reductions in PTSD symptoms than the usual care group. 

00:31:20
Summary of Studies on Anxiety & PTSD 

00:31:20
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Um, so we have five studies, and if you remember when we did the review in 205 there were no studies on anxiety and now we have five studies which is a really important advancement. There was an open trial by Perez in the RCT category, we have Rodriguez, we have Vera and we have Hinton, and we have what I'm calling the naturalistic study by Jeffreys. Um, so there really are no well-established treatments for PTSD with Latinos. There are promising avenues of research in the area of CE- PE and CPT, uh, for the treatment of anxiety disorders and PTSD, and there are two or five efficacy studies using some form of cultural adaptation. Um, which was also very interesting to find. 

00:32:00
Treatment Research with Latinos 

00:32:05
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Now we move on to research, treatment research with Latinos for psychotic conditions. And here we have, uh, think about we have four, maybe four or five studies. The first one, uh, is Kappellowitz out of Los Angeles. He's now at UCLA, correct? Or US- I forget where he is. But they essentially did a really interesting study and a very careful one with, uh, looking at, uh, skill training, uh, for a period of three months with individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. And versus the usual care condition. Uh, and there are followed for nine months and they showed a significant management in terms of the skills training over the usual care condition. Skill training had a direct effect on skill acquisition, generalization, um, and also a decrease rehospitalization. Okay, thank you. We have another study that looked at, uh, with 30 patients, uh, again randomized, culturally tailored skills training and equivalent treatment intervention versus community based support group and the Latinos received no culturally tailored, the culturally tailored intervention shows significant improvements in several outcomes. Uh, there are two more studies, the Telles, this is the Carno study in 1995 with Mintz, Paz. And they looked at a patient's less acculturated. They used extended care management for behavioral family management, uh, for six months for every two weeks, and they found that the less acculturated behavioral family management was significantly related to greater risk of exacerbation of, uh, symptomotology, uh, with the patients that were more acculturate. The Patterson and Bucardo, uh, McKibben, Mausebach et al, um, looked at, uh, again a culturally adapted, some of the panel, uh, which is the [non-English phrase] training program for the development of aptitudes with Latinos. Uh, versus a, um, support group, equivalent support group, and so they found significant effects in favor of the, uh, of the the intervention condition, the culturally adapted over the support group. 

00:34:20
Summary of Studies on Psychosis 

00:34:20
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. So we have four studies in psychotic conditions. We have the Kopellowitz study, we have the Mausbach study, we have the Patterson study. These are, these are essentially different, uh, treatment teams. And they Telles group, and there's evidence and support of skill training as a well established treatment for psychotic disorders with Latinos. Four of the three studies used, again, cultural adaptations. 

00:34:35
Treatment Research with Latinos 

00:34:35
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Now we have, um, treatment, uh, research with Latinos, uh, in other what I'm calling other treatment conditions or other health conditions, and we have the Alegria study which was, um, um, included 231 patients and this was called a right question project, uh, for mental health. It consisted of two four hour workshops, uh, where, uh, individuals were taught to ask questions of their, um, of their provider. Uh, and it lasted about 30 minutes, and the findings show that intervention were over twice as likely to be retained in treatment over three times more likely than comparison participants. Uh, and they have scheduled a visit, uh, for seeing their provider, uh, six, after a six month period. The importance of this is that it's something, it's not really like a motivational interviewing, but it's, it's sort of doing a, uh, dialogic intervention where you empower patients to be more assertive or affirmative, or uh, activate them in in asking questions of the provider and asking for treatment. The, the, uh, Anderson Stenton et al was a 12 week, um, study looking at Latino smokers, uh, using a, um, pharmacological intervention and they found that the, uh, varenicline reduced, had an impact on the base line rate of smoking, um, from pre to post. Then there is the Grilo study with monolingual Spanish speaking obese Latinos, Latinas, females, um, and they looked at, uh, orlistat plus culturally adapted behavioral weight loss for obesity with, uh, uh, BED, and for some reason I'm blocking out BED. Um, which is the, uh, Binge Eating Disorder versus placebo. And the other condition was the Orlistat plus behavioral weight loss for obesity without the BED, uh, without placebo. So, they were randomly assigned and they found that 78 completed treatment. Completion rates did not differ significantly by medication or BED and analysis, so I thought that was pretty good. Um, we have, I forgot we have more of these. We have the Penetto, Molton, Dahn and Bing-Jiun study. They had a, uh, cognitive behavioral stress management for half a day versus, um, control for half a day with educational seminar. And they found that, uh, cognitive behavioral management superior to the, uh, to the regular or to the educational seminar. And the other Penedo study was, basically the same study only that we analyze the Spanish, the Latino patients, and they found, uh, the uh, uh, culturally, uh, the cognitive behavioral stress management to be significantly superior to the other interventions the control intervention.

Summary of Studies on Other Health Conditions 

00:37:50
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. So, here's a summary of the studies on health conditions. Five studies on other health conditions, we have the Penedo, the two Penedo studies, the Grilo and White study of culturally adapted weight loss. In terms of clinical trials or the RCT, we have the Alegria, we have the Dios smoking nicotine replacement therapy, uh, and this is promising area for further research, five, okay. Um, more RCTs are required to establish the efficacy for treatments for other health conditions. So, this is the, uh, we have 20 studies for depression, 14 were culturally adapted, anxiety five, two of which were culturally adapted, psychotic disorders, four three of which culturally adapted and other health conditions, three of five are culturally adapted. 

00:38:35
Treatments in Spanish 

00:38:35
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. These are the treatments that were actually conducted in Spanish, which I was very impressed with that. Uh, for depression, here are the ones, Hinton and Perez and then the others are for the other conditions. 

00:38:50
Gaps in Treatment Research for Latinos 

00:38:50
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. So,we can say, uh, that there's some important gaps in the literature. No well-established treatments for anxiety disorders, treatment for smoking disorders and elimination disorders are lacking. There's limited research on non-CBT intervention such as, uh, behavioral activation. IPT, PST or culturally sensitive treatments as a research on the, uh, mechanisms of change are simply absent. We just don't know, we know it works, we really don't know how it works. 

00:39:15
Conclusions 

00:39:20
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. So, there's marked progress in treatment research with adult Latinos and Latinas. There's a huge disparity that remains between the number of studies with Latinos relative to the population. CBT appears to be a well established treatment for depression with Latinos. Many studies with Latinos continue to use some form of cultural adaptation, how that occurs varies a great deal. Um, and uh, CBT, prolonged exposure and, uh, culturally, uh, cognitive processing therapy, uh, are promising treatments for anxiety and uh, post traumatic stress disorder with Latinos.

Acknowledgments 

00:40:00
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. So, I want to acknowledge the, uh, members of the meta team and some of the colleagues that have been, uh, advising me on, on, on this project. Um, now, you may have noticed that, uh, in your packets, uh, you received a, uh, flier for, um, a wonderful book which is the AP Handbook of Psychology, but, um, my good friend, uh, Fred Leon is, uh, did not include another very good book that, uh, was recently published, which is Cultural Adaptations, uh, Tools for Evidence Based Pratice with Diverse Populations, with myself and Melody Dominez-Rodriguez. So, uh, gracias, thank you very much. 

00:40:45
[applause] 

00:40:50
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Do you want to take some questions now, how are we doing with time? We have a few more minutes? Okay. 

00:41:00
[sil.] 

00:41:00
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Fred, oh, I'm sorry. Over there. 

00:41:10
[sil.] 

00:41:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). So, I wonder if the (inaudible ) 

00:41:25
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Right. Yeah. Yeah. The issue of the homogeneity of Latinos. We have some that are more homogenous than others, certainly, and that will vary from study to study. What we were looking at is to simply to answer a much more first level question, is what, where are we now, what's missing in the literature, like for example, the studies out of LA are more likely to be with Mexican-Americans and Central Americans, uh, as the same as the studies in San Francisco, uh, or the studies out of New York are more likely to be Dominican and, and Puerto Rican. Uh, the studies out of Puerto Rico certainly are mainly, predominantly Puerto Rican. So, there's a great deal of, uh, homogeneity, uh, and that's something that we hope to look at uh, I have not looked at it as of yet cause we're really at a preliminary point. Eventually I think we're going to move into a meta-analysis of the information that we have, uh, which would mean coding for a lot of those kinds of variables. Yeah. 

00:42:30
[sil.] 

00:42:40
UNKNOWN We have successfully, uh, we have been successful in silencing you completely after, uh, I don't know how many hours of, uh, 75, 45 minute presentations. Well? We can leave the questions for- okay, Steven. Uh-huh. I knew you would save the day. 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible) 

00:43:15
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. You know, I was gonna, I was convinced that you're going to point out four of five studies that I missed. 

00:43:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible) but what, give us a sense of (inaudible ) 

00:43:35
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. You know, we have to, uh, I have to still look at that very carefully, uh, because we did include, I want to make sure that those percentages were made, I want to really include some of the ones we threw out because they didn't meet the 40 percent criteria of Latinos and maybe that's too stringent. 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:43:54
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. I just made it up. Uh, essentially because I, just made it up, that's why, um, I thought that was almost 50 percent, but I didn't want to put 50 percent as a criteria because I wanted there to be a sufficiently large number of, of Latinos in the sample. Uh, so I wanted to look at, I want to see the spread of it, how many were missing out of that, and then maybe come up, how do you usually do things, which is I get a frequency distribution and then when I look and see where are the natural breaking points and then make it a more, sort of data informed, uh, decision on that kind of thing. But at that point I can tell you that I just made it up. Yeah. But what we... 

00:44:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:44:37
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. There may be more, there may be more. So, I may need to what I'm planning to do, now, is to go back to all the ones that we excluded and then go over it very carefully. Uh, but I had to meet a deadline for a symposium I had a commitment to present the information here. 

00:44:55
[sil.] 

00:44:55
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Yes, Nolan? 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) diversity of the sample, do you (inaudible ) in terms of the trials, whether they actually (inaudible ) 

00:45:19
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Well, look at the, if we look at the, uh, the, the studies that, New Jersey, for example, the, the Latino population f New Jersey is going to be Puerto Rican, the Iterian studies, uh, the ones done with, um, um, a lot of the New Jersey medical school, uh, Howard, uh, Howard, I don't want to say Howard Johnson, Louisa help me out, here. 

00:45:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible) 

00:45:50
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. The New Jersey medical school, uh, that um, Robert Wood Johnson medical school. Robert Wood Johnson medical school, uh, the ones out of Columbia, they're going to be from really the, uh, uh, Washington Heights and, um, and uh, Columbia Heights are going to be Dominican and Puerto Rican and maybe some, uh, Cubans. Uh, we really didn't find any studies from south Florida. Contrary to what happens with the, with the um, Latino, the child, it's a whole other story, because there are many more studies from kids and adolescents, uh, out of the Chaposnic group and the Sant Estevan group. 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) So, our concern is that even (inaudible ) 

00:47:20
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. That's a great, great point, because I think that in many cases, they just get labeled as Latinos. Uh, and that doesn't help a whole lot, because then it doesn't mean much. Uh, I need to know nativity, as I think was being pointed out by, uh, by Martina and Francia and Ana Palia, uh, earlier in the morning. So, if I know nativity, then, then we can make some statements about, uh, uh, where they're from, um, in the. So, in the LA area, we know it's gonna be mainly Mexican-American, but that's changed so much. It's got a lot of Central Americans as you know, so that's the problem with, uh, with not, with what we find with many of the studies where it's very little attention is paid to the, uh, to the demographic, to the identification of, you know, uh, um, the ethnic categories that we're using, which, it's as, I think was said, they're basically political categories. Uh, and we need more, uh, sort of I think, categories that can help us with the research, and with the meaning of, of what the experience of is of being Latino. Or African American or Asian, etc. But I will certainly be looking at that, mm-hm. 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:48:42
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Larissa? 

00:48:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, I was (inaudible ) 

00:49:10
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Right. 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN Right now, (inaudible ) 

00:49:15
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Mm-hm. 

00:49:15
UNKNOWN ...and it's difficult to just have a sample of Puerto Ricans (inaudible) there's not that much you can say about (inaudible ) So, when you're looking, so, if (inaudible) 

00:49:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:49:45
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Yeah. 

00:49:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible) 

00:49:55
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Mm-hm. Yeah. 

00:50:00
[sil.] 

00:50:05
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Yes? 

00:50:05
UNKNOWN Um, (inaudible ) presentation (inaudible) Any suggestions for, um, graduate students who are researchers sort of thinking about (inaudible ) already marginalized in society?(inaudible ) 

00:50:35
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. Well, I would certainly not do more CBT study unless something very novel, okay. Or, you're combining with something else. I would do something that, uh, has not really been done, cause there's so many CBT studies. We have a lot of evidence that CBT works in the general population, we have a lot of evidence that it, well some mounting evidence that it works with, uh, uh, Latino populations. So, I would look at, uh, for example, problem solving therapy has not been studied a lot, behavior like (inaudible ) uh, a couple of papers are probably going to come out of that from the, uh, team at, uh, at the University of, um, Wisconsin at Milwaukee. Um, or, uh, combinations of treatments and certainly we know very little, if anything about mechanisms of change. The problem is I don't think and I mentioned is no longer interested in looking at mechanisms of change unless they are, there is a mechanism of change, uh, um, but from the biological perspective, um, um... 

00:51:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:51:39
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. I don't know. I don't know. Uh, it's, um, it needs to be, um, it needs to be focused on, it needs to be innovative, you know, it needs to be all those kinds of things, and you can't be doing the same thing all over again. Um, but I think they're not, that much interested, unless you combine it with pharmacotherapy and you do MRI, it will probably make it. If you do your baseline measures as being, you know, pre post follow up MRI study, then, then... 

00:52:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:52:11
GUILERMO BERNAL, PH.D. No, you can use the, uh, uh, the, uh, what is it called, domain research criteria. The domain, if you use domain research criteria then you have a chance. Instead of the diagnostic research criteria, the SM stuff, yeah. So, uh, yeah. But thank you, it was a very good question. I think we can talk more about other possible avenues that, uh, but I think process research, for me, is an important thing because it would help us establish whether or not I could fund it or not, I would do process research. And, um, uh, and then, uh, innovative treatments that we're doing, as I mentioned to a couple of colleagues here, we're doing a yoga intervention, now, with veterans, we're making a proposal. And that's going to a different institute, uh, to help deal with pain and PTSD in veterans at the VA hospital in Puerto Rico. And so, that's an innovative intervention for pain management. And then the idea is to see whether that will help engage folks, uh, in, uh, um, evidence based treatments, which are clearly available in the, uh, at the VA system in, in many VAs, now and in, in especially in Puerto Rico as well. So... Um, I see you're here. Thank you very much, I'm so glad to see you.
