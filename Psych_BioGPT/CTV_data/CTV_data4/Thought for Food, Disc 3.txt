00:00:05
JO Hello, Elaine. 

00:00:05
ELAINE Hi, Jo. 

00:00:05
JO It's nice to see you. Um, start as we normally start. Just to, sort of, a mood check as to how you're doing today. 

00:00:15
ELAINE Um, a little bit apprehensive. 

00:00:15
JO Right. 

00:00:15
ELAINE Mm. 

00:00:20
JO Right. And I know when we met just a couple weeks ago now . . . 

00:00:25
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:00:25
JO . . . there were some bits of, uh, some tasks to do . . . 

00:00:25
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:00:30
JO . . . between now and this week. And, uh, I wonder if you were able to, um, get any of those things . . . 

00:00:40
ELAINE Yeah, I'm . . . 

00:00:40
JO . . . done. 

00:00:40
ELAINE . . . I'm quite pleased. I wouldn't say that, uh, th-, there's one of them that I haven't mastered, but there's progress. 

00:00:50
JO Right. 

00:00:50
ELAINE And I'm pleased, um, I'm pleased with, uh, uh, how much I've stayed around for me to keep thinking about doing it. 

00:01:00
JO Right. So perhaps, if thinking about our agenda, if we can . . . 

00:01:00
ELAINE Mm. 

00:01:00
JO . . . talk about those on the agenda. Uh, I wonder if there's anything else you want to, to bring to today's session at all? 

00:01:10
ELAINE Yeah. Um, I'm pleased with progress so far, cuz it is sinking in more. But I, I'd like to find ways to up the ante a bit, um . . . 

00:01:25
JO Okay, yeah. 

00:01:25
ELAINE . . . to sort of, um, hmm . . . what do I mean by that? 

00:01:30
JO Yeah. 

00:01:30
ELAINE Um . . . get going or something or, um, cuz it seems I've been doing a lot of thinking about it. And some changes . . . 

00:01:40
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:01:40
ELAINE But, um, and I'm pleased with some of the changes. Yeah, up the ante. 

00:01:50
JO Right. So, so, sort of, moving from this other reflection about what you're doing, but actually now to start doing a little bit more. 

00:01:55
ELAINE Mm. 

00:01:55
JO Okay. So, so that's perhaps something that we'll look at as well. 

00:02:00
ELAINE Mm. 

00:02:00
JO Um, and there was something for me that, uh, from the last time we met that I, I, I, I, I might, if we have the time to put on the agenda today, around, um, monitoring, um, changes, uh, in, in, in yourself. You know . . . 

00:02:15
ELAINE Mm. 

00:02:15
JO . . . to monitor some changes. 

00:02:15
ELAINE Yeah, that's go-, that is a good point. Because, um, I think it's about change, and it, it's, um . . . I d-, I don't know if uncomfortable is the right word. It, it is. But, um, it doesn't feel uncomfortable in like a really negative, um, "I don't want this change," but it is uncomfortable to, to . . . cuz you've got to be so keyed into it all the time. Y-, you've, you've gotta be so . . . you gotta remember it all the time that you are on, are changing. So that could be uncomfortable. 

00:02:55
JO Right. Right. 

00:02:55
ELAINE Mm. 

00:02:55
JO So perhaps if we have the time . . . 

00:02:55
ELAINE Mm. 

00:03:00
JO . . . to talk about that as well. So, so monitoring change . . . 

00:03:00
ELAINE Mm. 

00:03:05
JO . . . and actually what change feels like for you. 

00:03:05
ELAINE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:03:10
JO Right. Okay. So, um, where'd you think we should start? Do you think we should we start with, with th-, the . . . 

00:03:20
ELAINE I suppose I'd like to tell you, since we've met, some of the things that, that has, um, you know, that have happened or come to the forefront. Um, I haven't brought anything back to show you but, and I, I got a filofax for work and, um, I've started to monitor on a weekly basis where there is some space . . . 

00:03:45
JO Right. 

00:03:45
ELAINE . . . and sort of starting to think, "Oh, you could go there or you could do that". So I, cuz, cuz there's your space . . . 

00:03:55
JO Right. 

00:03:55
ELAINE So for the past couple of weeks I've been, um, quite conscious really of looking at gaps . . . 

00:04:00
JO Right. 

00:04:00
ELAINE . . . cuz when we talked last time, I said there's no gaps. But, you know, that isn't really true. There is some gaps in the week and certainly some gaps on the weekend where I could fit exercise in. You know, um, and I, again, that fits with up the ante, because I'm not really sure . . . it's years since I've been in any form of exercise, like classes. I used to go a lot. So it's like, "Well, what do I really want to do?" 

00:04:35
JO Hmm. 

00:04:35
ELAINE You know, what really interests me? So, but there is gaps. And, also, um, the food changes are still going quite strong, and, cuz, last night I worked and I went out straight from work, and I was driving home about quarter to 11, starving, cuz I hadn't eaten all day. 

00:04:55
JO Mm. 

00:04:55
ELAINE Cuz I was, um, just, y-, couldn't fit food in. That, I know that's another thing, but anyway, um, I went to the Chinese on the way home, but I had boiled rice and, um, mixed veg. 

00:05:10
JO Right. 

00:05:10
ELAINE Curry mixed veg. So I thought, "Well, that's really good," cuz, you know, I probably would have had, um, Chips Curry. So I, you know, I was pleased about that, that type of shift. 

00:05:25
JO Right. So, if I can just pull that together a little bit. 

00:05:30
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:05:30
JO Um, because I know when we met last time, one of the things, I think, actually the first session I think you said, was that time . . . 

00:05:35
ELAINE Mm. 

00:05:35
JO . . . played a big part in not being able to eat healthily and look after yourself healthwise. But what you've discovered by monitoring it and, and writing it down, or sort of keeping some record, is that you have got time. 

00:05:50
ELAINE There is time, yeah. 

00:05:50
JO Yeah. It may not be a lot of time . . . 

00:05:55
ELAINE Yes. 

00:05:55
JO . . . but, but there are some gaps in there. 

00:05:55
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:05:55
JO So it's something about filling that time, what do to do in that time . . . 

00:06:00
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:06:00
JO . . . now you've discovered you've got it. 

00:06:00
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:06:00
JO But, uh, you also said that you're making some changes in what you're eating. 

00:06:05
ELAINE Yeah, like last night is an example. And . . . you know, it takes the same time to make a, make a, um . . . I don't know, like, cheddar cheese sandwich, as it does to make a salad sandwich with tuna. It takes the same, same time. 

00:06:30
JO Hmm. 

00:06:30
ELAINE And so, wh-, you know, when I was . . . you know, it's an avoidance. I was thinking, "Oh, well it'll take longer to slice a tomato, or it'll take longer to, you know, cut some lettuce up." But really, the same amount of time, cuz I've proved that. You know, I've actually consciously thought about how long does it take and, you know, sort of glanced at the clock to make, like, 'er, um . . . Yeah, and it's not . . . there, it's, it's no time, really. 

00:07:00
JO Hmm. 

00:07:00
ELAINE And something about having the, the right foods in the house as well. 

00:07:05
JO Mm. Yeah. So having that time is a, sort of . . . 

00:07:10
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:07:10
JO . . . an almost, almost sounded like it was a, um, an excuse. 

00:07:10
ELAINE Yeah. Yeah, it does sound, you know, I probably would have said that in the first session . . . That it, it, it is something about an excuse. It's an (inaudible ) syndrome. You know, it is . . . 

00:07:25
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:07:25
ELAINE . . . cuz, cuz, you know, I've really monitored that and thought about that a lot. 

00:07:30
JO Hmm. But there was also, uh, I think we identified there something about having the time for you . . . 

00:07:35
ELAINE Mm. 

00:07:35
JO . . . and I wonder if somehow that sort of connected there somehow. 

00:07:40
ELAINE Yeah. Yeah, it is. I mean, it is. That is a slower process than the other bits . . . 

00:07:45
JO Mm. 

00:07:45
ELAINE . . . but there is something sinking in about, um, you know, "Do this for you". Um, uh . . . 

00:08:00
[sil.] 

00:08:05
ELAINE . . . you know, put yourself first. And, um . . . that's odd to sort of explain that, but there's a shift in that. 

00:08:10
JO Mm. Mm. And you said you've said some of the food that you're keeping in the house. 

00:08:15
ELAINE Um, some, some of that started to happen, like I said about talking to people before I came. Um, just listening to what some people would call healthy food and it's not the fact that I didn't know that. I mean, I've, I've r-, I've run in my nursing job. I mean, I run healthy living clinics, myself, you know, um, weight reduction clinics. So I did know that, but I think it ties in with when you, when you don't wanna know or when you, um . . . cuz it's really ridiculous because I do know those things. 

00:08:55
JO Hmm. 

00:08:55
ELAINE But, um . . . yeah, so it's like going to the supermarket and then you'd spend a lot of time in the, in, um, the first and last aisles. Cuz I always find that fascinating that the food styles are usually about veg and, and, you know, um, um, fresh produce, and so is the last aisle. And it's those middle aisles in between that there's the processed, frozen, tin stuff. So, um, just consciously, you know, before I came on, since I've been coming, about, "Well, what's in these aisles?" 

00:09:30
JO Hmm. 

00:09:30
ELAINE You know, and, and, and having a look and, um, I guess, telling some mates in the office about, um, me eating an, um, an avocado. Um, I'd had it with friend before that but, you know, um, when I bought one I liked it to went off, cuz I didn't know what to do with it, but I thought, "Well, at least you bought it . . . " 

00:09:50
JO Hmm. 

00:09:55
ELAINE . . . cuz you knew it was good for you". 

00:09:55
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:09:55
ELAINE So those sort of things, you know? 

00:09:55
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:09:55
ELAINE And, opening the fridge and thinking, "Oh, yeah. There is loads of salad there." So, you know, I, I might not be completely shifting all the time to, to that would be my first choice, but they, I can't say they're not there anymore. 

00:10:10
JO Um, what it, sort of, sounds to me is if it's, it's coming into your mind . . . 

00:10:15
ELAINE Yes, that's . . . 

00:10:15
JO . . . a little bit more. 

00:10:15
ELAINE . . . exactly. More, more often than not. Like last night, it would've took the exactly amount of time, the same amount of thinking, the same price to go and get chips and curry. And when I went in there, you know, I thought, "No, what are the other options in here?" And, you know, I, I knew the boiled rice, obviously. I knew they sell boiled rice and that, that was the conscious shift. 

00:10:40
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:10:40
ELAINE And it, and it's exactly the same price, same time, same Chinese. But it's that conscious shift of saying, "Well, what would be better for you?" 

00:10:55
JO Mm. And how does that leave you feeling about yourself as a result? 

00:10:55
ELAINE Well, I was really chafed. I was. You know, when I, c-, cuz I, you know, it's a long day and I sh-, you know, on one level, you know, I, I should not have gone that long, but that's another story and I'll look at that. Again, you know, it's a long time to go from, you know, I left the house about quarter to 8:00. But it was, it, it was a lovely day, you know? And it all, th-, the day just molded into one and some things were unexpected. That's why I was so late. When I came out of the Chinese with the little bag thinking that there was boiled rice and veg, I thought, "That's really good." You know? And I got in the car and I went home and I, um, sat down and, you know, um, put it on a plate. And I thought, and I said, "Yeah, that's really good." And, you know, when I was eating it it was, like, it's no different if you had, like, special fried rice or it was no different if you had, um, sweet and sour. I mean, the, the taste and texture might be different . . . 

00:11:50
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:11:55
ELAINE . . . uh, but, no, I was pleased and . . . 

00:12:00
JO That, that seems to be a real shift . . . 

00:12:00
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:12:00
JO . . . and I can see from the way you're talking about it . . . 

00:12:05
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:12:05
JO . . . that there is a real shift there. 

00:12:05
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:12:05
JO I'm wondering how we can monitor that shift. What will tell us if that shift is actually paying off? 

00:12:10
ELAINE Hmm . . . Mm . . . There's something about that, that, um, I, I felt better that I'd eaten that, you know? 

00:12:30
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:12:30
ELAINE So, so that feel-good factor of "This is better for you." 

00:12:35
JO Right. 

00:12:40
ELAINE Um, I'd like to think that over a period of time that some weight would come off. 

00:12:45
JO Right. How would you be able to test that? Because I know you said, when we first met, you, you don't weigh yourself. 

00:12:50
ELAINE I know. And I still don't weigh, and I don't particularly want to weigh. Um, cuz that does freak me. Th-, th-, you know, um, the actual weight on scales. And, and I've learned that over a long period of time anymore. You know, when, when I was doing, um, uh, for the (inaudible ), when I'd run my own weight cl-, management. You know, you would see people in various sizes and shapes and things. And, um, those bloody numbers on the scale, and they don't really mean anything. I know they gotta be a measurement, but they don't really mean anything. So, yeah, I wouldn't like to weight. Um, you could tell by your clothes and things cuz, you know, your waistline and things. And, um, I think my waist and my hips are going to be the last place though, um, because they are carrying a lot of extra fat. I think my shoulders have gotten smaller over a period of time, though. 

00:13:50
JO Right. 

00:13:50
ELAINE And my jawline. 

00:13:50
JO Right. 

00:13:55
ELAINE You know, when I look in the mirror, I sort of think, "Oh, you know, you do seem to have lost . . . 

00:14:00
JO Right. 

00:14:00
ELAINE . . . this area." Um . . . 

00:14:00
JO If there was some tangible evidence of, of weight changes, how do you think that might an-, answer . . . let's assume that that, the changes would be . . . 

00:14:10
ELAINE Mm. 

00:14:10
JO . . . that the weight was coming off. How do you think that might help you overall? 

00:14:20
ELAINE Um, I don't want to fall into the cycle that weight is the only thing. 

00:14:20
JO Yeah. 

00:14:25
ELAINE You know, and I, I, I, I've shifted from that donkey years ago. You know, I wanna be size 10 . . . and the, the new craze is I wanna be a size 0 . . . um, but I do know that I'm overweight for my height from a healthy perspective. 

00:14:40
JO Mm-Hmm. 

00:14:40
ELAINE Um, I don't know. I don't really know if I'd be at a healthy . . . Hmm. 

00:14:50
JO I was just, sort of, wondering if when you are able to say, "Okay. I've lost an inch, or I've lost . . . 

00:14:55
ELAINE Mm. 

00:14:55
JO . . . two inches, or I've lost so many pounds". 

00:15:00
ELAINE Mm. 

00:15:00
JO It might actually help you . . . 

00:15:00
ELAINE Mm. 

00:15:05
JO . . . through the tough times. 

00:15:05
ELAINE Yeah, it's a good point. Because I'm saying that I don't want any sort of measurements, you know? 

00:15:10
JO Well, you're not gonna give yourself any credit. 

00:15:10
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:15:10
JO Um, it's all going to be based on how you feel. 

00:15:15
ELAINE Mm. So you're, sort of, saying that, cuz I, I guess you're saying feelings are good. But are you also saying that that might not be enough to sustain me, or, you know, or might, that might not be enough to, to gi-, keep giving myself praise? 

00:15:30
JO Well, I'm also thinking that sometimes if people feel down or fe-, people feel, uh, you know, anxious or depressed . . . 

00:15:40
ELAINE Right. 

00:15:40
JO . . . that sometimes how they see themselves might not necessarily be accurate. 

00:15:45
ELAINE Mm. 

00:15:45
JO So if y-, if there's a time when you're feeling, let's for want of a better word, say fat, it might not . . . 

00:15:55
ELAINE Mm. 

00:15:55
JO . . . actually be about your weight. It might actually . . . 

00:15:55
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:15:55
JO . . . be about how you're feeling about yourself. 

00:16:00
ELAINE No, that is a good point. Yeah. 

00:16:10
[sil.] 

00:16:15
ELAINE That is a good point because this, this month had been pretty challenging and, um, on some days that, that, that haven't been the best. Yeah, and I have sort of thought differently about myself. Yeah. So, um, I don't, I don't like weighing and measuring. How am I gonna get over that one, then? 

00:16:35
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:16:35
ELAINE I can see the point, yeah. 

00:16:40
JO What . . . 

00:16:40
ELAINE Cuz, yeah. 

00:16:40
JO How would it feel if, if somebody else monitored the weight and you didn't have to see the weight? 

00:16:45
ELAINE That wouldn't be so bad. I'm thinking I might be tempted to have a peek, which di- . . . you know what I think? That if, if, um . . . but they'd have to tell me that . . . so, yeah. Yeah, you're saying not that actual figure. 

00:17:00
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:17:05
ELAINE So they'd have to tell me whether I'd stayed the same or . . . 

00:17:05
JO Mm. 

00:17:05
ELAINE . . . or lost or gained, wouldn't they? 

00:17:05
JO Mm. 

00:17:10
ELAINE Mm. I'd prefer that, yeah. 

00:17:10
JO Mm. 

00:17:15
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:17:15
JO Well . . . 

00:17:15
ELAINE Cuz it, y-, yeah, cuz, cuz, yea-, um, I think, I think I know how roughly heavy I am. Um, but most people say that as well. But, um, uh . . . yeah, I see it in those big numbers. 

00:17:30
JO Mm. I mean, it, it, it could be something we could do as another sort of . . . 

00:17:35
ELAINE Mm. 

00:17:40
JO . . . experiment is to see how, how, how accurately your perception of yourself that day would be. You know, what, you know . . . 

00:17:45
ELAINE Mm. That's right. 

00:17:50
JO . . . do you, would you think you'd lost weight or gained weight as to, compared to the, to what's, the measure says. 

00:17:55
ELAINE Yeah, that's a good idea. Yeah, I quite like that idea. 

00:18:00
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:18:00
ELAINE Hmm. 

00:18:00
JO Hmm. 

00:18:00
ELAINE Because already I, I, I, um, I could give you a figure of how much I think I weighed, but I . . . 

00:18:05
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:18:05
ELAINE . . . I mean, I haven't been on a scale for about five years? So . . . 

00:18:10
JO Hmm. And what happens if that figure's actually more than you really weigh? 

00:18:15
ELAINE Mm. 

00:18:15
JO What would that mean for you? 

00:18:20
ELAINE Oh, well God. I wouldn't particularly like that. 

00:18:25
JO If it was more, if the figure in your head was more than the figure than you actually weighed? 

00:18:25
ELAINE Oh, right. Sorry, sorry, sorry. That, that would be, um, yeah, that would be good, yeah. I'd be chafed. If it was the other way around it would be like, "Oh . . . 

00:18:35
JO Mm. 

00:18:35
ELAINE . . . more work". 

00:18:40
JO Right. 

00:18:40
ELAINE Mm. 

00:18:40
JO Right. So it's a bit of a double edged sword actually knowing. 

00:18:40
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:18:45
JO Yeah. 

00:18:45
ELAINE Yeah, cuz I, I, I think, I'm thinking that I'm about, um, four or five stone overweight. That's what I'm thinking. So, like, if it was, if it was more I'd be thinking, "Aw," cuz it is quite hard to lose weight, and I think we have to acknowledge that it's not an easy task. But, yeah, and it'd be like, "Oh, my God. There's more hard work to do," and . . . 

00:19:10
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:19:10
ELAINE . . . that sort of deflation before you start. 

00:19:10
JO Mm-hmm. So perhaps finding another measure of change . . . 

00:19:15
ELAINE Hmm. 

00:19:15
JO . . . that's not necessarily, at the moment, around weight . . . 

00:19:15
ELAINE Mm. 

00:19:15
JO . . . or, or measurement size but, but some-, something's that telling you . . . 

00:19:20
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:19:20
JO . . . that things are, things are happening and things are changing. 

00:19:30
ELAINE Yeah. Um . . . 

00:19:30
JO I wonder if there's something that you'd want to be able to do that, that your weight is making harder for you to do at the moment. 

00:19:40
ELAINE Hmm. 

00:19:45
[sil.] 

00:19:45
JO I could give a . . . 

00:19:45
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:19:55
JO I'll give you an example. I mean . . . 

00:19:55
ELAINE Mm. 

00:19:55
JO For example, it might be . . . I had somebody once, um, who wasn't able to, to bend down to clean the bottom of their cupboards in the kitchen . . . 

00:20:05
ELAINE Yes. 

00:20:05
JO . . . because it was, it was a bit of a struggle to be able to do that. 

00:20:05
ELAINE Yes. 

00:20:10
JO So that the day that they were able to do that . . . 

00:20:10
ELAINE Yes. 

00:20:10
JO . . . you know, that it was a, a real measure that, that ac-, actually things had changed. 

00:20:15
ELAINE Yes, I'm with you. Um, I can do all things like that and, like, um, like the stairs are getting a, a lot better. That's already a measurement. 

00:20:25
JO Oh, right. Brilliant. 

00:20:30
ELAINE The, the stairs where I work. 

00:20:30
JO Yeah. 

00:20:30
ELAINE Um . . . 

00:20:35
JO So that's . . . 

00:20:35
ELAINE You know, that fe-, feeling, you know, you haven't got that sort of gaspiness at the end, at the end of the, um, fourth floor. You know, it, I still feel a bit weary, but it's not like the very first times that I used to do it. 

00:20:45
JO Hmm. 

00:20:50
ELAINE I mean, yeah . . . um, that has quite interested me, really, though. How to, how to measure, cuz that's, that links to upping the ante. Because I really do wanna . . . 

00:21:05
JO Hmm. 

00:21:05
ELAINE . . . you know, I've sort of got a bite for it now. And I do want to keep it up. Um, I, I, I just want that, like last night, that's a good example. It was in the moment that I had that choice, and I could've gone that way or that way and I stuck to, to the, the choice that I want to make, you know? So if I could capture that moment in every situation that would be great. 

00:21:35
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:21:35
ELAINE That would be really great. 

00:21:40
JO So how could we capture that moment? What was it that happened for you in that moment? I, I wonder if you can sort of . . . 

00:21:45
ELAINE I . . . 

00:21:45
JO . . . take yourself back there. 

00:21:45
ELAINE I, yeah, it was, um, it wasn't linked to the Chinese. I, it was, like, previous to that, the last couple of hours to the feel-good factor. I, um, had a real successful evening at my work and went out with, um, people for a drink, um, people that I, I respond to and admire. Um, that's what led up to the fe-, to going in, um . . . 

00:22:15
JO So it was something around being with people that you like and having a good time with them. 

00:22:25
ELAINE Well, just feeling good. 

00:22:25
JO Right. 

00:22:25
ELAINE Yeah, just feeling good. Yeah, just, um, in a good frame of mind. 

00:22:30
JO Hmm. 

00:22:30
ELAINE It was definitely something to do with that. Of course, there is that in the moment. You know, as the Chinese guy is saying to you, "What do you want, love?" You know, and you've got a split second . . . 

00:22:40
JO Mm. 

00:22:40
ELAINE . . . to say, "Oh, give me a bag of chips." And I, you know, and I said boiled rice. There is the split second, but it, it was a knock-on effect from a couple of hours before. 

00:22:55
JO So . . . 

00:22:55
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:22:55
JO . . . I wonder how you were seeing yourself when you were with those people, having the drink, having the good evening at work. 

00:23:00
ELAINE Huh. 

00:23:00
JO How were you seeing yourself? 

00:23:05
ELAINE On the whole, um, on the whole, you know, um, happy with myself. Confident. You know, um, people were, like, ask-, you know, picking my brain sort of thing. And, you know, and me remembering where, where, um, why they would be doing that. 

00:23:30
JO Hmm. Why would they be doing that? 

00:23:35
ELAINE Um, because I have been in that place that they've been. 

00:23:40
JO Right. 

00:23:40
ELAINE So they were, like, were interested and, you know, and, and hungry for some information and knowledge, really. 

00:23:45
JO And what would that say about you, the fact that they were . . . 

00:23:50
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:23:50
JO . . . they were asking you? 

00:23:50
ELAINE And that they, you know, appreciated and valued what, you know, what information I would give them. That they, they sort of rely, you know, they relied on me that, that, um, you know, a couple of people said, "Oh, thanks for being so honest." That type of thing. You know, "Thanks for, for not being, um, one way or another. You know? 

00:24:15
JO Thanks for being you, it sounds like. 

00:24:15
ELAINE Mm. Yeah. Yeah, a couple of people did say that actually. You know, that, um, yeah, that they'd often portrayed me as just being me. 

00:24:35
JO So there was something around that feedback that you were getting last night that gave you that, you said, that good feeling . . . 

00:24:40
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:24:40
JO . . . which then . . . 

00:24:40
ELAINE You know, I, I, I wouldn't have known that last night, but the more I've thought about that it, it added to keeping to the right decision about myself. 

00:24:55
JO Hmm. 

00:24:55
ELAINE And I'm surprised that I, I'm surprised that I've thought about that, really. 

00:25:00
JO Hmm. And I'm sort of thinking, "How can we capture . . . 

00:25:00
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:25:05
JO . . . the last night . . . " 

00:25:05
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:25:05
JO You know, what, what happened last night? So you always got that to hand. Cuz it, cuz that's what it sounds like. That that was, that really helped you. 

00:25:10
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:25:10
JO And make a healthy choice for yourself. 

00:25:20
ELAINE I don't know how I'm going to capture it. Um, I could think more about that. You know, I could, um, that's a bit sort of the stuff that I'm doing anyway. Um, it might need a little bit more thought, because I've only just thought about it actually . . . 

00:25:45
JO Hmm. 

00:25:45
ELAINE . . . talking to you about it, really. 

00:25:50
JO Yeah, I was thinking . . . 

00:25:50
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:25:50
JO . . . it wouldn't, wouldn't it be wonderful if we could sort or have a little, you know, you could pull it out . . . 

00:25:55
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:25:55
JO . . . and, and, and replay that . . . 

00:25:55
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:25:55
JO . . . that, that incident, you know, that evening? 

00:26:00
ELAINE Yeah. Hmm. Cuz it's in the moment, like, in all that was . . . but it was in the moment that, you know, I, I knew I was going to call for the Chinese, cuz I was absolutely starving. 

00:26:20
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:26:25
ELAINE And I was thinking, mind (ph), I was thinking, Elaine, you could go home and have a tin of soup. But I was thinking, "No, I really do want Chinese." So it was in the moment of getting out of the car, walking into the Chinese, and the, the guy saying to me, "Well, love, what do you want to eat?" 

00:26:35
JO Mm. 

00:26:40
ELAINE Mm. Yeah. I need to think about that really, and . . . 

00:26:40
JO Okay. Yeah. Cuz, cuz I'm, I'm wondering if, if there are an-, any other links as you see . . . 

00:26:50
ELAINE Hmm. 

00:26:50
JO . . . this linking with other things that we've talked around with regards to, to you and your relationship with food. 

00:27:05
[sil.] 

00:27:10
ELAINE Mm. I can't believe how clear it's becoming to me. Um, not so much, um, relationship with food. I love food and I love all sorts of food, but the relationship I have with myself. And then food is a, is the, either the punishment or the payoff for . . . 

00:27:30
JO Right. 

00:27:30
ELAINE . . . whatever you want to call it. So, um, it's a bit freaky. Wh-, you know . . . 

00:27:40
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:27:40
ELAINE . . . it, it, it's a bit overwhelming to think about the role food can play. 

00:27:50
JO Mm. Oh, and, and what really interested me, from what you just said then, was that there would be that need to punish yourself . . . 

00:27:55
ELAINE Mm. 

00:27:55
JO . . . involving food. 

00:27:55
ELAINE Right. Yeah. 

00:27:55
JO And where that would come from. 

00:28:00
ELAINE Yeah, because the knowledge, the, the knowledge, the, um, information that I have from various roles that I've done in life, I know that if we eat the wrong foods . . . not, not, not, I don't want to keep saying right or wrong . . . 

00:28:15
JO Mm. 

00:28:15
ELAINE . . . but, you know, food will have a negative impact on your well-being. And I know that. 

00:28:25
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:28:25
ELAINE Um, I don't know where the word punishment came from, though. 

00:28:30
JO Hmm. Yeah. 

00:28:35
ELAINE That was quite . . . yeah. 

00:28:35
JO Just cuz I'm interested why you would need to punish yourself. 

00:28:35
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:28:35
JO Period. 

00:28:40
ELAINE Yeah. That's, that's really mad. Cuz I, I hadn't brought them today, but my thought records. Do you remember when I put down about, um, the Welsh cakes? 

00:28:45
JO Mm. 

00:28:50
ELAINE You know, the, the beating up I did because I wanted a bloody Welsh cake? I mean, I love em. You know, and tho-, those Welsh ones. The Welsh, Welsh cakes. They're absolutely fab. It's crazy, isn't it? 

00:29:05
JO Mm. So that was . . . 

00:29:05
ELAINE Mm. 

00:29:10
JO . . . that sort of led us from your homework of sort of . . . 

00:29:10
ELAINE Mm. 

00:29:10
JO . . . just watching y-, your, your, your time, and it's sort of taking it a little bit about . . . 

00:29:15
ELAINE Mm. 

00:29:15
JO . . . how we're going to up the ante. But before we look at that in, in more detail, I, I wonder how you got on with the other homework task. 

00:29:25
ELAINE Yeah, the, um, the homework around the banana. 

00:29:25
JO That's right. 

00:29:30
ELAINE Yeah. That was, that hasn't been such a good experiment. Um, that hasn't been as easy to achieve as I th- . . . I thought that would be easy. Last time I sat here I was thinking, "Yeah, I can do that. You know, I can. It's a banana and you can do that." But it's the whole, you know, it's the whole, um, significance of that banana. 

00:30:00
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:30:05
ELAINE And that hasn't particularly happened be-, the, because, uh, um, Liam and myself have been, we've been a bit at, um, (inaudible[00:30:12), really, cuz he's 19 and he's just on his A levels, and he's changing, and so there's been a few arguments, which has left me feeling a bit out of sorts. And that took me down a few steps. I haven't managed to, to . . . cuz last night I was thinking, "I didn't do this, so this could be in-, instead of the banana." Cuz last night I was thi- . . . cuz he was out when I got home and I was thinking, "Well, I bet he'll be angry," cuz this was only the small portions from the Chinese, for one really, I guess. Um, and then I thought, "Now, shall I, shall I split off of this to keep for him?" And then I was thinking, "Oh, well he doesn't like boiled rice anyway." But it was the still, I first, that first thought, you know, I'll give him half. And, um, well, actually to tell you truth, I did, did start sharing it on two plates and then I thought, "Well, he doesn't really eat boiled rice anyway. So he probably won't eat it and he wouldn't want the vegetables on it alone." So eventually I ate the whole portion myself, but it was still that very first . . . 

00:31:20
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:31:20
ELAINE . . . first thought of, "Well, I bet he'll be angry when he comes in." Um, yeah. So the ban-, the banana didn't happen, which I thought would really be easy. And, um, still things have been . . . 

00:31:30
JO Mm. 

00:31:30
ELAINE . . . pretty all over the shop, which has made me think, "Oh, God . . ." 

00:31:35
JO Mm. 

00:31:35
ELAINE Am I doing this parenting thing right? And, um, and then, of course, last night, a first instinct. Although I didn't, but that was only cuz he didn't like boiled rice. If perhaps I'd got that other option, I probably would have split that as separate in two . . . 

00:31:55
JO Mm. 

00:31:55
ELAINE . . . even though it was probably just for one. And, and just, you know, um, put it in the microwave for when he'd come in. And then at sometimes, you know, I get up in the morning and, you know, he hasn't had his . . . "No." I ask him. "I was out. No, mom. I didn't feel like it." And I'm think, "Well, I could've had that." It's crazy. 

00:32:15
JO So that almost sounds as if it was a bit too risky this, this, these past few weeks to, to do that experiment. 

00:32:25
ELAINE Well, other things got in the way anyway. 

00:32:25
JO Yeah. 

00:32:25
ELAINE And it just . . . yeah, the focus wasn't on that experiment. 

00:32:30
JO Right. 

00:32:30
ELAINE Cuz all this upheaval was going on and it was quite, you know, it has been quite distraught. You know, we have been, um . . . I've felt really wobbly with it all. So the experiment wasn't uppermost in my mind. So . . . 

00:32:45
JO Yeah. 

00:32:45
ELAINE But, um, yeah, it's mad that even last night I was thinking, "Oh, I, I might it share with him." And then it was only cuz he didn't like it. 

00:32:55
JO I mean, what I'm struck with that, that's really interesting is that, that it sounds like what enabled you to buy the boiled rice . . . 

00:33:05
ELAINE Mm. 

00:33:05
JO . . . and the, and the, the vegetables rather than the chips . . . 

00:33:10
ELAINE Mm. 

00:33:10
JO . . . was that people, your work colleagues, had, had, had sort of made some really positive comments about you. 

00:33:20
ELAINE Mm. 

00:33:20
JO And, and one of the things that we were going to explore with regards to the banana . . . 

00:33:25
ELAINE Mm. 

00:33:25
JO . . . and Liam was about being good enough. 

00:33:25
ELAINE Yes. 

00:33:25
JO And I'm really struck with the fact that being seen good enough by your work colleagues . . . 

00:33:35
ELAINE Mm. 

00:33:35
JO . . . was a really helpful thing for you. 

00:33:35
ELAINE Yes, that is a good point. 

00:33:40
JO Yeah. 

00:33:40
ELAINE Yeah. No, that's a real good point. Cuz, um, yeah, cuz my lads on some occasions, they're just saying it to me. It's, like, just, "Oh, mom. Take no notice of us. It's part of growing up. We don't really mean it." But s-, sometimes they do say really horrible things and . . . which gives the interpretation of not being a good enough mother. 

00:34:00
JO Yeah. 

00:34:05
ELAINE You know, they, they do. And, and then they, they come back with, you know, "Oh, mom. You know, you know, we don't mean it." But, God, you know, how many times have I got to hear it to think, "Oh, well they don't really mean it?" 

00:34:15
JO Hmm. 

00:34:15
ELAINE You know, when you, when they, they, they're quite decent ages now (inaudible ). 

00:34:23
JO But . . . 

00:34:25
ELAINE Yeah, that's horrible. That is. 

00:34:25
JO . . . both incidents . . . 

00:34:25
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:34:25
JO . . . are from other people's view. 

00:34:30
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:34:30
JO And, and I'm really struck that, how you're, how you're, you and your relationship to food are, are sort of really, in some ways, dependent on other people's view of you. 

00:34:40
ELAINE It looks like that, doesn't it? 

00:34:40
JO Hmm. 

00:34:40
ELAINE Yeah, and, and, you know, overall I would say that, um, it's a continual work, you know? But I do know that judgement of others have played a big part in my life. 

00:34:55
JO Mm. 

00:34:55
ELAINE And although I continue to do work on that . . . but, yeah, that it, that is really highlighted there, isn't that? 

00:35:00
JO Hmm. 

00:35:00
ELAINE Hmm. I'm not sure I like that (inaudible ). 

00:35:10
JO What are the benefits you think for, for it? For, I mean, other people's view of you. So important. 

00:35:25
ELAINE Um, well, in the right sort of place and context it is, you know, like, in a work environment, or a teamwork, or, you know, a friendship, or something. It is nice to have feedback, you know, sometimes. Or, well, you know, you're okay, like, you're, you're working along the right tracks or, you know, you're, you're playing yourself to the right job or something. You know? I suppose it, it, um, becomes a difficulty is you solely rely on that. You know, that, that, um, that you forget about telling yourself, I guess. 

00:36:00
JO Mm. 

00:36:00
ELAINE That's what I'm thinking. Um, but it is nice to hear people say, "Well, that was a job well done," or, you know, or um, you know, um . . . 

00:36:10
[sil.] 

00:36:15
JO I s-, I suppose for me what becomes a bit of a, a, a downside to it, is that it does depend on are people remembering to do it . . . 

00:36:25
ELAINE Mm. 

00:36:25
JO . . . or people never, for getting angry, or . . . 

00:36:30
ELAINE Mm. 

00:36:30
JO . . . with you or . . . 

00:36:30
ELAINE Mm. 

00:36:30
JO . . . or, um, it would really be dependent on keeping everyone sweet. 

00:36:35
ELAINE Mm. Hmm. Yeah, and I think it links back to the session we had about, um, you know, my mother, sort of, only, uh . . . not only, but her comfort was feed. Have a nice meal. Uh . . . 

00:37:10
JO Hmm. Well, that would explain . . . 

00:37:10
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:37:15
JO . . . the, the, the eating when you're not feeling good . . . 

00:37:15
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:37:15
JO . . . but I wonder how it explains the eating when you're feeling good about yourself. 

00:37:25
ELAINE I don't know. I suppose it's a choice really, cuz it's all food, isn't it? It's a choice . . . 

00:37:30
JO Hmm. 

00:37:30
ELAINE . . . of what food you choose. Whether you're feeling good or feeling bad, really. 

00:37:35
JO Right. 

00:37:40
ELAINE Cuz even if you're feeling bad . . . I don't know. Yeah, it, it links a bit to that sort of, um . . . I'm reluctant to use the word punishment again . . . it links then, like, if you're feeling bad. You know, blow it off that or I don't know or, or it doesn't matter, or . . . 

00:38:00
JO Hmm. 

00:38:05
ELAINE You know, and, and have things that, um, have food that are not necessarily so healthy for you then. Cuz it doesn't matter anyway. Something like you don't matter, so the food don't matter, sort of thing. 

00:38:15
JO Right. 

00:38:20
ELAINE That's what I'm thinking and . . . 

00:38:20
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:38:20
ELAINE Hmm. 

00:38:25
JO Yeah, it might be interesting to, to, to watch your moods . . . 

00:38:25
ELAINE Mm. 

00:38:25
JO . . . and, and, and is there a, is there that, that link? 

00:38:25
ELAINE Yeah. I'd like to do that, cuz that, that is becoming more evident. Especially as we're talking that is . . . 

00:38:35
JO Hmm. 

00:38:35
ELAINE . . . that is making more links about mood and choice of food. 

00:38:40
JO Mm. Yeah, cuz we've looked at . . . 

00:38:40
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:38:40
JO . . . thoughts, but we didn't really . . . 

00:38:45
ELAINE Mm. 

00:38:45
JO . . . focus on the moods much. 

00:38:45
ELAINE Mm. 

00:38:50
JO Um, although we made . . . I think we made some sort of deduction, didn't we . . . 

00:38:50
ELAINE Yes. 

00:38:50
JO . . . from some of the thoughts . . . 

00:38:50
ELAINE Yes. 

00:38:50
JO . . . what your mood might have been. 

00:38:55
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:38:55
JO Yeah. 

00:38:55
ELAINE Yeah, definitely that is a good idea to actually . . . 

00:39:05
JO Hmm. I wonder what's going through your mind just now, Elaine. 

00:39:10
ELAINE Well, I can see my mother's cupboard. That's all I can see. I'm in my mother's kitchen and I can see my mother's cupboard. It's a pretty . . . it's . . . it's a pretty strong image. 

00:39:40
JO Where are you in the image? 

00:39:45
ELAINE Whew. Um, yeah, standing at the cupboard. Um, everybody meets in my mother's kitchen. It's italian style, so this is a side entrance. She's right on the very end. And, um, yeah, y-, you always go into the kitchen. You very rarely go into the living room. Um, and you tend to sit in the kitchen. Um, yeah, in this cupboard that I've got the image of is only where the goodies are. There is the, like, um, she's always bought, you know, she bakes and things. So there's always, like, fruit cakes and biscuits and, um . . . yeah, and that's what was so, was, took my, uh, took my attention there quite really quite strongly. 

00:40:25
JO Hmm. 

00:40:30
ELAINE I don't know what that was about. Yeah, I don't know what that was about. 

00:40:35
JO Hmm. 

00:40:40
ELAINE Quite emotive, too. 

00:40:40
JO Yeah, I wonder what that left you feeling about, that image? 

00:40:45
ELAINE It was quite overpowering, really. It was quite, um, it's really overwhelming. It fact, quite very emotional. Hmm. 

00:41:00
JO What do you want us to do with that image? 

00:41:05
ELAINE I, I don't know. Gorge? Eat everything in there? 

00:41:10
JO Hmm. 

00:41:15
[sil.] 

00:41:15
ELAINE I don't know why. I got a massive, um, hollowness in my stomach as we're speaking. I don't, I don't know why. I really don't know why. 

00:41:25
JO I wonder how old you are in that image? 

00:41:30
ELAINE Oh, yeah. It's not when I was younger. It's now. 

00:41:35
JO Hmm. What will happen, do you think, if you did eat everything in the cupboard? 

00:41:45
ELAINE I'd feel sick, that's one thing. Cuz there's, it's jam packed. There's always lots of biscuits in every description, and cakes, and . . . there's, there's two, two tiers in this cupboard and this, um, (inaudible ). What's interesting is, um, yeah, sometimes you tend to just go in there and open it without thinking. And I'm having a massive moment here. I'm thinking, "I wonder what it would be like to go in my mother's front door?" Cuz I've never been through my mother's front door? Cuz I, I can actually, it's, it's sort of come in more, a bit more real now. It, it, that would be . . . oh, I . . . that was a bit odd. Um, yeah, sometimes you just walk into my mother's kitchen, cuz she's mostly there. My father's in the living room sitting down watching a bit of tele or something, cuz they're quite elderly now. And my mother's in the kitchen. She's a very active woman. Um, and, um, so she'll be cooking full day anyway. Food is always on the going at my mother's house. She cooks for two people in the street, even. That type of thing. Um, and you tend to just walk in, grab a barstool. I tend to walk in and I'll, I'll open that cupboard. It's, like, the first thing I do. 

00:43:15
JO Hmm. 

00:43:15
ELAINE And, and I might not always. You know, depending, like, what we've been talking about. What sort of mindset or frame set I'm in. You know, I might alw-, you know, perhaps, shut it and . . . cuz she's got a lot of other things, you know? My mother's quite a healthy eater. There'll be fruit there. I might have a bit of fruit or say, "Is there, is there a yogurt here?" Um, but, yeah, that is . . . 

00:43:35
JO Mm. 

00:43:35
ELAINE . . . sort of, inst-, you know, instantaneous, you know? So . . . 

00:43:40
JO Okay. Good. Mm. And I know you've talked in the past about food being this was the language of love . . . 

00:43:45
ELAINE Yes. 

00:43:45
JO . . . that your mother would use. And it . . . 

00:43:50
ELAINE Yes. And what I'm thinking about now, is do I go to that cupboard, when really I'd like her to sit and hear my woes? You know, I don't know this yet. This is what I'm, uh, you know, sort of, thinking to myself. You know, do I wanna go there and say, "Oh, mom, I really need you to know this," in terms of emotional stuff? And do I do that? That would be good to monitor as well. 

00:44:20
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:44:25
ELAINE I don't know. I'm certain of that. 

00:44:25
JO Mm. 

00:44:30
ELAINE Or, you know, has it become a habit? You know, cuz we know habits can, can then . . . 

00:44:40
JO Mm. 

00:44:40
ELAINE . . . form. Cuz it, you know what? Of course I like sweet things . . . 

00:44:45
JO Mm-hmm. 

00:44:45
ELAINE I mean, I don't see why I'm not able to like sweet things. But there's been times where I prefer them to any other food. 

00:44:55
JO Mm. 

00:44:55
ELAINE And I have been known to choose them (ph) foods over other foods. 

00:45:00
JO And they're in that cupboard. 

00:45:00
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:45:05
JO Yeah. Elaine, I wonder if it's okay if we just leave that . . . 

00:45:05
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:45:10
JO . . . there for you to, to sort of think about . . . 

00:45:10
ELAINE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:45:10
JO . . . for the time being. I'm aware that our time's . . . 

00:45:15
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:45:15
JO . . . sort of cracking on. 

00:45:15
ELAINE Yeah. That, that's really interesting. I will look at that. 

00:45:20
JO Yeah. We need to, perhaps, look at what we've got left . . . 

00:45:25
ELAINE Mm. 

00:45:25
JO . . . on our agenda. And one of the things was about upping the ante . . . 

00:45:30
ELAINE Mm. 

00:45:30
JO . . . and, uh, I suppose, um . . . well, w-, what, what . . . 

00:45:35
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:45:35
JO . . . do you mean by upping the ante? 

00:45:40
ELAINE Well, to be honest, that's shifted some more in talking. Cuz I think it links more to monitoring. I think, I think, I was thinking upping the ante, "Let's go to a class," you know, or something. 

00:45:50
JO Right. 

00:45:50
ELAINE Or, you know, but I think a minute, upping the ante could also mean a need to monitor more. So that, you know, cuz that is still upping the ante. So the moods and to think about that real strong image that came to my mind . . . 

00:46:05
JO Right. 

00:46:05
ELAINE . . . about my mother's house. Um, that's upping the ante, I think. 

00:46:15
JO Okay. 

00:46:15
ELAINE And, and I like that idea about, um, you know, somebody else monitoring . . . 

00:46:20
JO Right. 

00:46:20
ELAINE . . . so that, that to me is upping the ante then. 

00:46:25
JO Okay. Who, who would you, who would you want to, to monitor? 

00:46:30
ELAINE Um, w-what sort, what do y-, or do you mean whoever, I get a choice? 

00:46:30
JO Yeah. 

00:46:35
ELAINE Or, you know, um . . . 

00:46:35
JO Is there, is there someone that you got in mind that, that . . . 

00:46:35
ELAINE Outside? 

00:46:35
JO Yeah. 

00:46:40
ELAINE Oh, gosh. Who would I ask? Yeah, well I got a friend. Yeah, I got a friend who would take that, that role seriously. You know, not seriously like, "You naughty girl," but, you know, would be supportive. 

00:47:00
JO Right. Okay. We . . . sounds like you got a fair bit of homework. 

00:47:05
ELAINE Yeah. It does sound a bit, doesn't it? 

00:47:05
JO Yeah, um, because the other thing that . . . 

00:47:05
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:47:05
JO . . . I, I, I wondered whether or not, um, t-, for you to think about is how you could capture what happened to you last night? If there's a way that . . . 

00:47:15
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:47:15
JO . . . that you could . . . 

00:47:15
ELAINE I need to keep thinking about it. That's one way. 

00:47:20
JO Yeah. 

00:47:20
ELAINE You know, I could write it down or something. But . . . 

00:47:20
JO What a good idea. 

00:47:20
ELAINE Yeah, but I, I need to, I need to really keep thinking about that . . . 

00:47:25
JO Yeah. 

00:47:25
ELAINE . . . and perhaps write it down. 

00:47:30
JO Yeah, and that, that would be really good. You've have it there . . . 

00:47:35
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:47:35
JO . . . then, wouldn't you? 

00:47:35
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:47:35
JO In black and white . . . 

00:47:35
ELAINE Yes. 

00:47:35
JO . . . this, this is what happened . . . 

00:47:35
ELAINE Yes. 

00:47:35
JO . . . on that night. 

00:47:35
ELAINE Yes. Yes. 

00:47:35
JO Yeah. Well, you're coming to the end of our session. 

00:47:45
ELAINE It's gone quick. 

00:47:45
JO And I won-, I wonder . . . we did a mood check at the start . . . 

00:47:45
ELAINE Mm. 

00:47:45
JO . . . uh, I wonder what you would say that the mood is that you left with now? 

00:47:55
ELAINE Um, the apprehension has shifted. Um, it's not excitement. It's, um, what could be similar to that? It's not, I'm not apprehensive about my future or about these tasks, but it's not like, "Oh, God. I can't wait to get out of here and do them." I don't know what word I'd use to say, um, it's not really excitement . . . it's energized, perhaps? 

00:48:25
JO All right. 

00:48:25
ELAINE Or motivated? Motivated? 

00:48:25
JO Right. 

00:48:30
ELAINE Yeah, motivated. 

00:48:30
JO Right. Good. 

00:48:30
ELAINE Hmm. 

00:48:35
JO Okay. Well we're going to draw it to a close now. 

00:48:35
ELAINE Perfect. 

00:48:40
