Exploring the Depth Dimension Way 

00:01:00
DAVID COLE Hi, I'm David Cole and I'm a therapist, teacher and senior trainer for the Seattle Hakomi Education Network. The depth dimension chart idea came to me at an international conference of the Hakomi education network in Puerto Morelos, Mexico in 2012. Prior to that meeting, my wife Caroline and I were exploring the, and snorkeling the reefs in the area. And I believe it was the beauty and wonder and mystery of those underwater landscapes that inspired me to think of Hakomi in terms of its depth dimension and thus the name the depth dimension chart. So, now let's turn to the depth dimension chart and see if it can help us to fathom the beauty and wonder and mystery of Hakomi. This is an example of a depth dimension chart. This one was created by our graphic designer with this video demonstration in mind. Ordinarily, we use a simple black and white version that's easier to change and less expensive to print. In either case, over the past few years, we've made various kinds of charts to accommodate different situations and purposes. While, they're usually filled out by hand, in this film, we use graphics and prints, so we can read them better. As you can see the processes of Hakomi are listed down the left side of the form. They're listed in the order that they appear in a typical session. They're also grouped with the names of the skills that belong to each process for example, under the process called tracking, we have the skills of loving presence, contact statements and acknowledgements and the mental skill of gathering hunches and ideas about the possible back stories and making a mental list of indicators. These are all part of the tracking process. The second process is about conducting experiments. It includes the skills of verbal offerings, using indicators, tension sequence, taking over and there is a category for other. Taken together, these skills comprise the Hakomi experimentation process. As we move down the list, it's important to note that the major processes and their skills are listed in the order that they occur in sessions. This is also the order in which they're usually taught and finally the order of psychological depth at which they're usually are best used to help a session unfold. The integration process is not included on the front of the chart. That would be difficult because it really belongs on the top of its page, since it returns the client to an ordinary state of consciousness. So, in this version of the form, we have placed it on the top of the back page. We've also added three processes from internal family systems below it which is where they should be since they deal with memory. These are alternatives or supplements to the Hakomi processes of memory work, missing experience and integration. While they're not used in this presentation, we've included them to show how processes from other methods can be integrated into a Hakomi training program that's organized around the depth dimension idea. The timeline is an important part of the form. You'll see it along the bottom of your screen. When the therapist uses one of the Hakomi skills, the observer places a check mark or a dot on the chart at a point above the timeline where the skill was used. For example, if the therapist used an acknowledgement two minutes into the session, the observer places a marker, horizontally across from a skill and vertically above the two minute mark on the timeline. Notes when we add it to job the memory later, even long after the session is over. To avoid clutter, notes are best keep brief. Also there is no need to be too precise. The relative position of events in a sequence is much more important than the exact time of occurrence. In this presentation, we'll use a chart with a 30 minute timeline. This is because the annotation videos we're using for our demonstration is in short session. It's more common to use 60 minute timelines on front and back. Since Hakomi sessions often take that long. The timeline is most useful in reviewing a recorded session. When working with students in a live session, a chart with no timeline is best. It's efficient to check off the skills as they're used and make a few notes at the end of each session. At the end of a session, student and trainer can review the chart. They can even fill out the chart together after a session. I like doing at the most. It's the easiest way I found to give feedback. It's not judgmental or critical and I think the student learns more and it helps a student internalize a map that can be very useful when leadership is called for in a session. On the right side of the form, there are group of skills that are frequently used in more than one process. Contact statements for example are often used early in a session during the tracking phase. But they're also frequently used when working with a child which is much deeper and usually occurs much later in the session. This also applies to the use of silence, comfort, acknowledgement and the skill of talking to the child. One of these skills have a characteristic depth and order in the sequence. They can also be used independently of depth and in any order. We call them floating elements and use the suffix F plus the abbreviation CF or contact statement, A for acknowledgement, S for silence, C for comfort and TC for talking to the child. F signifies that they're out of their usual process and depth. The depth dimension chart has a number of uses. As I've mentioned earlier, trainers use the simplified version without a timeline in live sessions. Also the depth dimension chart in combination with other forms is an excellent way to ground discussions between trainers and students about progress. Reviewing a stack of say 30 charts from a weekend level 3 workshop provides similar analytic feedback to trainers. Patterns emerge as to where sessions are getting stuck, what skills are not being used and what kind of help a training team can provide to improve their student's performance in the next training event. Finally the depth dimension chart facilitates a self-teaching process for advanced students using it with recordings of sessions gives a matter of fact, non-judgmental feedback about their own work. I think a perfect starting point for learning to use this chart is to practice with it while watching video sessions and specially the ones recorded by Ron Kurtz. Including his annotation series and there are other Ron Kurtz demonstrations available through Ron Kurtz Hakomi Educational materials. These provide a wonderful way to sharpen skills and absorb the feel of Hakomi. There are many levels of instruction in every session and the synthesis of both sources of reflection is a great learning experience for students at all levels from the level two to the seasoned Hakomi trainers. While the annotation sessions are very deep, I like to remind myself and my students that sessions need not be deep to be good Hakomi. A brief session for example may not include processes related to unconscious memories, going for meaning or a specific missing experience, need to provides much needed comfort and helps clients move through their grief with less suffering. Other exceptions include new clients and clients who have difficulty being mindful or naming their feelings and body sensations. Their sessions may call for more leadership or they may not go beyond the process of tracking or they may decide to use other methods with them like internal family systems or focusing before they're ready for experimentation leading to deeper work. Hakomi sessions can also be used to discover and embody positive resources. This style of Hakomi, an adaptation created by Donna Martin focuses more intently on somatic patterns. These patterns include clusters of indicators that represent implicit aspects of memory. This style of Hakomi calls for a modified skill list and a few processes that won't be found on the charts used in this demonstration. In using the depth dimension chart, it's important to remember that Hakomi is a flowing organic and intuitive right brain process. Ron Kurtz often compared Hakomi to the art of jazz. In fact I've come to think of the marks and notes on a chart as a kind of musical notation like sheet music or score that allows me to recreate the flow of themes in a session. Like jazz Hakomi has learnt mimetically through a right brain process of imitation that includes creativity and imagination and finding one's one authentic style. In speaking about their art, many master jazz musicians have emphasized the need to practice playing chords, rifts and scales and learning to read music. They also advice a lifelong practice of these basic skills so, that they can be accessed automatically and without effort. I found that practice with a depth dimension chart enhances this part of the learning process and makes it more interesting by inviting participation. It also engages the left brain and uses it to support what is basically a right brain, intuitive and creative process. That is the intimate and subtle music of Hakomi. This completes our tour of the depth dimension chart. Now, let's turn to its application as we demonstrate how to use it by charting the session from the Ron Kurtz annotation video collection. 

00:13:20
UNKNOWN In part two of this presentation, we use a depth dimension form to chart one of the sessions in the Ron Kurtz annotation collection. It is the second video in the annotation series and features Ron Kurtz working with a client named Claudia. For this demonstration, we replaced Ron's annotation comments with five brief pauses. During this pauses, we'll plot the processes and skills that were used in the preceding segment of the session. Because this is a very short session, we'll use a depth dimension form with 30 minute timelines on front and back in order to provide more space for notations and comment and a clear demonstration for the viewer. Now, let's listen to Ron Kurtz, the therapist and creator of Hakomi as he introduces Claudia in his second annotation video. 

00:14:20
RON KURTZ What would you like to tell me. 

00:14:25
[sil.] 

00:14:30
CLAUDIA I don't think I can, I can't exactly say why I, I'm crying. But, um, I can't. 

00:14:40
RON KURTZ So. 

00:14:40
CLAUDIA You know, it's, I don't know the reason. It was all right yesterday. I was, always, it was hurting a lot, here. And when she, when Sandra had her session. 

00:14:55
RON KURTZ Session. 

00:14:55
CLAUDIA Yeah. I was crying all the time. I don't know why. I mean, one topic is, I can't learn, I, I feel I can't learn. It's, I can't take it in and the other thing is I've always that feeling I'm not being myself quite. I'm always trying to be like others expect of me. So, my therapist said to me okay, what do you think, we go for a walk and I'll just take over. That, that everything is okay and we, we feel good and I tried to imagine being with her, or being any where but just being myself with another person and I couldn't even imagine what this would be like. So, umâ€¦ what I like best about my life is being in my bed reading a book and not being there at all and having nobody with me. This is when I really can relax. This is this rather boring to boring kind of life. And learning is, learning is, which is long part of all this bigger thing, I think. Learning would be get, getting in contact with the ideas of somebody else, taking it in, thinking about it. 

00:16:25
RON KURTZ So, you're, you're going to describe to me, sounds like you have a habit of setting down on people that are close on people. Yeah. 

00:16:40
[sil.] 

00:16:45
CLAUDIA Sometimes, it's really nice with other people but afterwards, the next day, I'm completely, um, exhausted. I'm exhausted. Although, I like being, this last year, uh, often like being with people and I'm more relaxed than I used to be. But still, I'm exhausted. 

00:17:05
RON KURTZ Mm-hmmâ€¦ so, you're using a lot of energy when youâ€¦ 

00:17:10
CLAUDIA Yes. Yes, I'm using lot's of energy obviously. 

00:17:10
RON KURTZ Let's do this, so much, aboutâ€¦ let's figure out, what, what you're doing with that energy and see if we can help you, see if we can, we'll do whatever it is you do for you when you're with people, okay. So, we have to explore what, what, what kind of, what motivates you, what kind of energy do you have to use to be with people and the way, possibly the way to do that is to just close your eyes and we'll just leave you alone for a while okay, just relax as possible and then when you're ready just open your eyes and to be with us and study how you do it. What, what comes up in your mind, in your body, you know, what, what kind of energy do you mobilize like to be with people? 

00:18:10
[sil.] 

00:18:45
RON KURTZ You're getting more energyized. Yeah. 

00:18:50
[sil.] 

00:18:55
UNKNOWN At five and a half minutes into the session, we paused to update the chart. As the session opens, we meet Claudia and then her sisters Sabrina who will assist her in the session. We are immediately aware of Claudia's present moment state and from her tears and other expressions we see that she has identified with her experience, an experience of sadness and frustration. With Ron's invitation, Claudia explains that she can't learn and take things in and that she's not able to be herself because of trying to meet the expectations of others. As she continues Ron makes two acknowledgements. The first pertains to shutting down and the second to her use of energy. 

00:19:45
[sil.] 

00:19:50
UNKNOWN We can add both acknowledgements to the chart in the tracking process with the notes shut down and energy as reminders. These are placed over the timeline at three and three and a half minutes into the session. Ron then sets up an experiment to explore the habits that consume Claudia's energy when she's being with others. To do this, he uses a be with exercise. We place this on the chart in the experimentation process using the skill called other. And we add a note at about four and a half minutes into the session. As Claudia engages in the experiment, she tears up and her trembling intensifies. Ron contacts this change of state with the words, getting more energized. This contact statement deepens her experience and we recognize that a transition has occurred and the session has moved from experimentation to the regulate and stabilize process. So we'll add it as a contact statement within that process at about five and a half minutes in. This brings us to the end of the first commentary so we can now return to the session and see how it unfolds. 

00:21:15
RON KURTZ Can you, can you be with this experience you're having and just talk a little bit to me why you, tell me what's going on? 

00:21:25
[sil.] 

00:21:30
RON KURTZ It's difficult. 

00:21:35
CLAUDIA It's difficult to, to, I'm, I can't describe it but I don't know what is going on. It's, ummâ€¦ I feel so sad and unhappy. 

00:21:50
[sil.] 

00:21:55
RON KURTZ I'm gonna ask you but don't try to do anything. Don't try to answer, just see what happens when I say, and I'd ask you. Claudia, it all violates to, why are you sad? 

00:22:20
[sil.] 

00:22:25
CLAUDIA It's going away. 

00:22:30
RON KURTZ Okay. Do it, just don't tell me, it's like a power, want to run away from that. Don't let them see us there. I have to make someâ€¦ kind of that's to work. I want to tell you, okay, you can be sad with me. You can show me your sadness. It won't hurt me. 

00:22:55
[sil.] 

00:23:20
UNKNOWN It's now seven and a half minutes into the session and time to update the chart again. At the beginning of this segment, in the wake of the be with experiment, Ron asks Claudia to stay with her experience and encourages her to talk about it. When she doesn't answer, he contacts her silence with the word difficult which we can note on the chart at six minutes along on the timeline. Claudia responds to the contact statement with the words, I feel so sad and unhappy. Attempting to fill out the meaning of Claudia's experience Ron asks, what happens when I say, why are you sad? And she replies that the sadness is going away. What follows is a series of acknowledgements by Ron starting with don't tell him and then it wants to run away and finally, don't let them see you sad. Here in this, acknowledgements deepens Claudia's sadness we'll add the acknowledgements with the single place marker at seven minutes into the session. When she hears the acknowledgements, Claudia nods with certainty. Now, Ron adds, you can be sad with me. You can show me your sadness. It won't hurt me. While a child part has not made an appearance so far in the session, Ron's tone of voice makes it clear that he's addressing a child. So we interpret these words as an example of the skill called, 'talking to the child' and we add this to the chart at about seven minutes alone and use the suffix F to indicate that it is used out of its usual place which is in the memory process. This nourishment goes deep and it releases an unrestrained expression of sadness and relief. The camera pulls back to reveal the use of comforting touch and a long silence. These two important skills are recorded within the process of regulate and stabilize at seven and a half minutes into the session. This concludes the second pause for updating the chart. Now, let's return to Ron and Claudia to see how the session continues. 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:50
RON KURTZ There's still a part that hold it in. Do you? That part, can you speak from that part as the part that wants to hide? Yeah. 

00:26:10
[sil.] 

00:26:20
RON KURTZ You're saying no to something, no. 

00:26:25
CLAUDIA I don't know why. 

00:26:30
RON KURTZ You don't know why you're hiding, want to hide? 

00:26:35
CLAUDIA Uh-huh. It's just clear, it's not a good idea toâ€¦ 

00:26:40
RON KURTZ Right. 

00:26:40
CLAUDIA Really cry. 

00:26:45
[sil.] 

00:26:50
RON KURTZ We're gonna pull back a little bit leading too far. 

00:26:55
[sil.] 

00:27:00
RON KURTZ So that the belief is, this is not a good idea to, to, to cry or to show them you're crying or to show. 

00:27:05
CLAUDIA Not to cry at all. 

00:27:05
RON KURTZ And don't cry. 

00:27:10
CLAUDIA Not, not, even when I'm alone. 

00:27:15
RON KURTZ Okay. So that, that believe is a habit, so, it was all habit of thought and maybe, if we take it over, maybe we'll evoke a little bit of the memory with it, where it made sense. Where it was something you wanted not to do because there's a part of you that's back there, is still running this and we can rescue her. Would that be nice? 

00:27:50
CLAUDIA Yes. 

00:27:55
RON KURTZ Okay. So when you hear the voice and Betina(ph) would you come. Yeah, I want to do it in German, okay. 

00:28:05
CLAUDIA Oh, no, let's do it in English. 

00:28:05
RON KURTZ You wanna do it in English? 

00:28:10
CLAUDIA Yes, I studied it, I, I understand pretty well. 

00:28:10
RON KURTZ It's not about understanding, it's about evoking. 

00:28:15
CLAUDIA It's about, oh, yes, okay, I see, what you mean. Okay. 

00:28:20
RON KURTZ So Claudia, what you want to do is, listen to this voice, listen to how it says it and if it doesn't sound quite right, adjust it. So that it sounds exactly like it acts in your mind, okay, let's try it once, you just listen to it very carefully. Don't, don't cry. 

00:28:45
SABRINA Don't cry. Okay. 

00:28:50
[non-English narration] 

00:28:55
[sil.] 

00:29:15
CLAUDIA Makes me angry. 

00:29:15
RON KURTZ Good, good. 

00:29:20
[sil.] 

00:29:30
RON KURTZ So, we're gonna say it again. Masha is just gonna hold your wrist, just in case, you wanna get movement. Okay, you're allowed to move if you want to. 

00:29:40
MASHA Yeah, uh, I'd back to. 

00:29:45
RON KURTZ Yeah, if it feels good? Soâ€¦ 

00:29:45
MASHA You can keep it there. 

00:29:45
CLAUDIA Okay, good. 

00:29:50
RON KURTZ Yeah. So when you're ready. 

00:29:55
[non-English narration] 

00:30:00
[sil.] 

00:30:15
[non-English narration] 

00:30:20
[sil.] 

00:30:40
CLAUDIA I'm getting a headache. 

00:30:40
RON KURTZ You're getting a headache. 

00:30:45
CLAUDIA Yeah, a little headache andâ€¦ getting still, it's like I'm getting. 

00:30:55
RON KURTZ It's like saying shut down, get quiet, don't move, don't do anything, suffering there after it's okay. So this is the habit, strong feelings come up. 

00:31:05
CLAUDIA I shut down. 

00:31:05
RON KURTZ You shut down, that's the whole general pattern. 

00:31:10
CLAUDIA Mm-hmm. 

00:31:10
RON KURTZ Okay, so we're gonna talk to you about that now, which is do it softly and if you want to have a good uh, emotional expression that's fine, that's totally fine, you tell us, we'll, we'll create that. But I wanna look for the situation that created this. The habit that you have of shutting down is what we want to look at. So either, you can have a great time exploring which is being far, perfect for all. 

00:31:40
CLAUDIA I've had that, I've had that so often. So boring. 

00:31:45
RON KURTZ Okay. 

00:31:45
CLAUDIA I do. 

00:31:50
RON KURTZ But only if it feels good, you know, keep that in mind. Whatever feels good. That's, that's when you're acting in your best interest and you're, you're being yourself, what it feels good. So we'll do this thing, we wanna look for, uh, yeah that's great, there is suffering ah! 

00:32:10
CLAUDIA Really. 

00:32:10
RON KURTZ Yeah, yeah, yeah. You face get soft, it was beautiful. 

00:32:15
CLAUDIA I like it, I like, like you said, if I feel good then it is myself, it is that. 

00:32:20
RON KURTZ Yeah, yeah. 

00:32:20
CLAUDIA This was nice. 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN At 14 minutes into this session, we pause for more updates. The segment, begin with Ron acknowledging Claudia's habits of shutting down. We'll mark this on the chart as an acknowledgement, we call it once more that the session is in regulate and stabilize process. We can place our mark at about eight minutes along on the timeline. Ron now invites Claudia to speak for the part that wants to hide. Then he contacts her long silence by saying, no to something, huh. We'll place this contact statement on the chart just past eight minutes in as well. This contact statement takes the process deeper as Claudia says, it's just clear, it's not a good idea to cry. At this point, Ron suggests an experiment. He asks Sabrina to take over the voice don't cry in German. A few minutes later, he adds to that experiment by having another assistant hold Claudia's wrist. We'll note the taking over experiment at ten and a half minutes in and add a second note for hold wrist at 12 minutes into the session. This is an example of evoking a memory with an experiment. Ron uses it frequently in the annotation video series and it points to the importance he places on accessing memory as an essential step in Hakomi process. On our chart the skill is included in the memory process. These experiments produce a headache and the shutting down behavior which Ron contacts with the words shuts down strong feelings. We'll place this on the chart at 13 minutes in as a contact statement with the F added to remind ourselves that it is out of its usual position in the list of processes and skills. A few minutes later Ron encourages Claudia with the words, if it feels good, it's yourself and her face spontaneously softens. When Ron contacts your softening face, she's profoundly touched by this moment of being unconditionally seen and accepted regardless of her anger and hiding. We'll add this as another contact statement and place it 14 minutes in on the chart with the note, face softens. Now, let us return to the session and see where it goes from here. 

00:35:10
CLAUDIA I like it, I like that when you said, if I feel good, then it is myself, is that. This was nice. 

00:35:15
RON KURTZ Yeah, right, superb Do you know what we're doing, we're looking for memory because a memory will make sense at a behavior and a memory will also tell us that, you don't need that behavior here. We'll just do this once again. 

00:35:35
CLAUDIA Okay. 

00:35:35
RON KURTZ Then you can tell me, what to say too if, you feel no other, what's more evocative but because not with this tip. 

00:35:50
[non-English narration] 

00:35:55
SABRINA Okay. Ready? 

00:35:55
CLAUDIA Yeah. 

00:36:00
RON KURTZ No more, no more feeling, I'm glad.

00:37:30
CLAUDIA I prefer doing it myself. 

00:37:35
[sil.] 

00:39:15
CLAUDIA What I feel like is a bit like when I was a little girl and I was little bad tempered. I was soâ€¦ I wasn't good but being a bad girl. I wasn't funny, I wasn't nice, I wasn't good girl. 

00:39:35
SABRINA You were not happy. 

00:39:40
CLAUDIA Not the happy kid, my parents would have. 

00:39:45
SABRINA Angry. 

00:39:50
CLAUDIA Angry, yeah, just a little bit, it's more like running around all the time withâ€¦ 

00:40:00
RON KURTZ Yeah. Put words, words, use words to that. I want, that's what I want. 

00:40:10
CLAUDIA I'm so fed up with that. I am, I just don't like it, you, it's you. I find it so disgusting with you. I find it hateful. You're so hateful. You're justâ€¦ 

00:40:30
[sil.] 

00:40:50
CLAUDIA I could never, I could never do it right, never, I'm never the right person, I'm always told, always doing things wrong. I can't ever be a good person and I hate it. 

00:41:10
RON KURTZ Yeah, louder, try it louder. I hate it. 

00:41:15
CLAUDIA I hate it. I just hate it being with you. 

00:41:20
UNKNOWN Here we are at the fourth break 20 minutes into the session. At the beginning of this segment Ron discloses in all we're trying to do, we're looking for the memory. We interpret this as an attempt to evoke a memory using suggestion. And mark it in at 18 minutes along. He then sets up an experiment to take over the words, no more feeling in German. Since, it's clear that Ron is using this experiment to evoke a memory and not to test the hypothesis. We'll stay in the memory process and mark it in at 18 minutes or with the timeline. In doing so, we're being faithful to where the session is with regard to depth. This experiment evokes a child part and it's clear from Claudia's tone of voice and body language that she's strongly identified with her angry and grumpy little girl. We will record this in the memory process as working with the child. It also contains other elements such as witnessing and going for meaning. All of these elements of memory work arise spontaneously and unfold rapidly. We'll place them in the chart between 19 and 20 minutes in before we turn in to the session. 

00:42:50

UNKNOWN Deal. 

00:50:00
RON KURTZ I'll reinforce it, yeah. 

00:50:05
[sil.] 

00:50:15
RON KURTZ Good. And we'll come back, if something comes up inside, if, you know, may not, just might be great, you know. Reinforc to happen, this is much, I don't need you to be happy, oh no. but if something comes up, you tell me all right. 

00:50:30
CLAUDIA Okay. 

00:50:35
RON KURTZ Because I wanna work on it. 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN The session has come to an end, so let's add what happened in the closing seven minutes. This segment begin with Ron offering Claudia a missing experience, as he talked to the child saying, I don't need you to be happy. I don't need you to be good. We can add this to the chart as an example of creating a missing experience. We'll enter this on the chart at 20 and a half minutes along on the timeline. Then Ron sets up an opportunity to intensify the missing experience while also shifting it to the context of play. To do this he stages the falling over exercise. This is also a way for Claudia to take back her power and to reconsolidate deeply her beliefs about pleasing others. The reconsolidating experience is one of her hilarity and joy and it's experienced first with Ron and then with the entire group. To record this we'll place a marker for the skill of using people in the room as part of the orchestration of a missing experience at 23 minutes in. At this point, it is necessary to turn our chart over in order to record the final skills which belong within the integration process. We'll start with the skill of using play to recontextualize which can be placed at 23 minutes in, on the new timeline. We'll also add the skill of practicing new responses at about the same time and involving others in the room a few minutes later at about 25 minutes in. In the final moments, Ron flittingly relates the session to real life situations, that is, her future interactions with the group. This occurs at about 27 minutes into the session and brings the session to its close. 

00:52:45
DAVID COLE I hope you've enjoyed this demonstration and that you'll continue your study of Hakomi or making full use of the many tools at your disposal, including the depth dimension chart and Ron's annotation series and other video demonstrations. I also hope that you'll try the depth dimension idea with video recordings of your own work as well. In doing so, you may want to modify the list of processes and skills to suit the style of Hakomi that you practice and teach. If you are a Hakomi trainer, you may find the depth dimension process useful in providing feedback to students. The chart shows students the skills, they can use to lead with their clients when leadership is called for in a session. I think, we all agree that Hakomi is a client led and client centered approach. Even so, a therapist gentle leadership is essential. It is very difficult to provide leadership if the therapist isn't familiar with the organic form of a deep session. On the other hand, I'd like to keep in mind that not all clients are ready for deep memory work. Within our counseling practice for example, many of our clients arrive without the ability to sustain mindfulness. Many people live in a world of their own thought. Often, they can't feel their bodies, much less name their present moment experience. So, we always want to meet our clients authentically and patiently, where they are in every moment. Often we'll draw from other methods and make up new skills and processes to meet our client's unique needs. Hopefully their trust and mindfulness will increase and they'll acquire the resources to help them discover deeper and more productive levels of embodied experience. Thank you for this opportunity to talk with you about the depth dimension process. I think, it fills a gap by providing a notation for a very creative and intuitive endeavor. I hope you'll find it useful too and that it will make your learning and teaching Hakomi much easier and more enjoyable.
