BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Okay, let's get started. The theme for this session is, uh, "The Union of Humanity and Technique," I believe. And, uh, it's curious to have to say there -- this is about the union of the two, because there's really no way to separate them; they're joined together, and, uh, we have to find some way of not allowing one to interfere with the other. Now, uh, what I mean by "humanity" -- uh, can you not hear me? 

00:00:40
UNKNOWN No. 

00:00:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER No? Um -- speak louder? Does that do it? 

00:00:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:00:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay. What I mean by "humanity" is simple kinds of engagements that we all participate in, just things like saying hello and, uh, being kind to each other, laughing and, uh, telling stories, conversational things. And those of course are very interesting but they're -- they're not going to do the job in therapy, because therapy calls upon certain knowledge about what makes experience count and what enables people to enter into their minds, in a way that ordinary conversation doesn't induce. So we have to combine the two, and much of what we do in our trainings is to develop techniques of one kind or another. And I could name a number of the techniques now, but I don't think we want to do that. I want to just speak very briefly to you, because the main part of this session is going to be my having an actual therapy session with somebody, for you then to observe some of the qualities that enter into the question of uniting simple contact, simple humanity, and the technical aspects of how therapy works. Now, one -- and I want -- I want, then, you -- for you to be able to tap into those issues when we discuss it afterwards. I'll try working for about a half hour, and then we'll be able to have a discussion about the concepts of, uh, simple contact and humanity and the technique. I'm reminded of a, uh, friend of mine who had a -- a guest. Can you hear me okay now? 

00:02:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:02:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Uh, I'm reminded of a friend of mine who had a guest who was a concert violinist, and she stayed with her while she was performing in San Diego. And, uh, she practiced all day long; she practiced simple phrases and would repeat them over and over and over. And finally my friend asked her, 'Why do you do that all day long?' And she said, 'I do that all day long so that when I'm performing I don't have to think about it; I can be a human being.' And I think that's what we have to do in therapy: uh, to work our technology in such deep and, uh -- and, uh, developed way that we can then leave it somewhat behind, enough behind so that what's left over is the personal quality that never interferes with the technology but evolves from it. So with that in mind, I would like to ask whether somebody would like to come up and work with me for such a session as I described. Okay, come. You have to sign a release; somebody here will do that. 

00:04:00
[sil.] 

00:04:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Boy, this is a vast space; I might dream of falling into it. 

00:04:45
[sil.] 

00:04:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Can -- can somebody help her with that? 

00:04:55
LETICIA  It's a smart (inaudible ), these guys. 

00:05:02
DR. ERVING POLSTER I can never handle those things. 

00:05:05
LETICIA Oh, here we go. It's this way. 

00:05:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:05:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Is that okay? You want to test it? 

00:05:10
LETICIA Okay, can you -- 

00:05:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER You want to test it? 

00:05:10
UNKNOWN Little closer. 

00:05:10
LETICIA Little closer? Is that better? 

00:05:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER Can you hear her? 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:05:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay. What is your name? 

00:05:20
LETICIA Leticia. Leticia. 

00:05:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Leticia. Yes, yes, yes. Hi, Leticia. Where should we start? 

00:05:30
LETICIA Well, I don't know. 

00:05:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, then we're on the same plane, aren't we? It's nice to start out equal. 

00:05:40
LETICIA Yeah, that feels pretty good. 

00:05:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. But it's not going stay equal very long, because it's going to be your thing. 

00:05:50
LETICIA Okay. Well, I guess -- 

00:05:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER But there's -- there's no rush. I mean, it doesn't have to be the first thing you think about. We have some time, a half hour. But you understand that we're just going to be working about a half hour, and -- and I think there might be some interesting illuminations for you, but, uh, that's what it is, yeah. Okay. 

00:06:10
LETICIA Okay. Well, I guess what I have talked to a therapist about before is the relationship with my father. So let's -- we could talk about that. 

00:06:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, we could, but do we want to? 

00:06:20
LETICIA Well, it's -- I would like to. I mean, it's something that I've been thinking about recently. 

00:06:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Then one -- you said we could talk about it, so I can't take for granted that you really want to. I think maybe you're picking any port in a storm. 

00:06:35
LETICIA Uh, yes. 

00:06:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay. 

00:06:35
LETICIA But it's a port I've used before, so -- 

00:06:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER I -- I know that. I'm not a sailor, but I know the phenomenon. 

00:06:40
LETICIA Yeah. It's something I've -- I've done before and I feel like it's an ongoing -- something ongoing for me. 

00:06:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Something you've done before in your own therapy, or in this kind of a situation? 

00:06:50
LETICIA Uh, not in this kind situation, but -- 

00:06:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:06:50
LETICIA -- in my own therapy. 

00:06:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER In your own therapy. Well, I'm open to whatever it is you want to deal with with -- in relation to your father. I -- I think fathers are important people. 

00:07:00
LETICIA I do too. 

00:07:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER I've been one, am one. 

00:07:05
LETICIA So I -- I think where I'm at right now is, rec -- or about a year ago, a little over a year ago, I decided not to have contact with him, by phone or written or see him. And that seemed like the -- the right thing to do for me at the time. And I am struggling with that still, if -- if -- if that's still the right thing. 

00:07:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, my dear, you seem so deeply, uh, feelingful about it, on the one hand, and it sounds like you're dismissing it all, like, 'Well, it's just any old thing I just happen to be bringing out. 

00:07:40
LETICIA Oh, well, I mean, it -- it is a big deal. 

00:07:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER It is, of course. Uh-huh. 

00:07:45
LETICIA Uh -- 

00:07:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER In what -- 

00:07:45
LETICIA I -- I have mixed feelings about it. 

00:07:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Well, tell me about it. 

00:07:50
LETICIA Well, on one hand I do want a relationship with him, cuz he's my father and that's a big deal. And on the other hand, that relationship is really painful and seems to evoke a lot of anxiety and sadness and anger and emotions in me that I don't -- that I'm not particularly happy about. 

00:08:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER A lot of stuff, yeah. Well, what is it that happens? What evokes all this? 

00:08:25
LETICIA Uh, well, before we -- before this past year, anytime we would talk on the phone or anytime I would -- even before I would see him, but especially when we were together; just spending time with him and sometimes, you know, now just thinking about him. 

00:08:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, but what do you do when you spend time with him? 

00:08:50
LETICIA Um, well, the last time we spent time together, we -- we went on a backpacking trip. 

00:08:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, backpacking trip. And how was that? 

00:09:00
LETICIA It was intense. 

00:09:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Intense in -- yeah. 

00:09:00
LETICIA It was just the two of us, so -- 

00:09:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Well, tell me about -- intense in what way? 

00:09:10
LETICIA Uh, well, I kind of -- you know, those -- the feelings that I've had about him that I've seen -- like I've had about him forever but of -- of course I haven't, uh, were all evoked in our trip together, and, um, the same feelings of frustrations and being angry and sad. 

00:09:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, what'd you get frustrated by? 

00:09:30
LETICIA Well, just to give an example, we were in the wilderness, and he had forgotten -- 

00:09:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER That was a very brave thing for you to do, to go off in a wilderness with a man you have a lot of trouble with. 

00:09:45
LETICIA Yeah. I -- at the time -- 

00:09:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER How'd you get up that kind of courage? 

00:09:50
LETICIA Well, I thought that it would actually -- at the time, I thought that it might be easier to go off with him than to spend time with him where I live in the city. Um, and looking back, um, maybe it was a decision that was made out of, you know, a little bit of fear and anxiety and -- and maybe some courage. 

00:10:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. And perhaps some determination too. 

00:10:15
LETICIA Determination to make it work -- 

00:10:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER To make -- 

00:10:20
LETICIA -- to have a good time with him. 

00:10:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Determination to make it work. But I wonder if you believe if it could or would. 

00:10:25
LETICIA I think I have some doubt in my heart that it -- that it would. I mean, I -- I did then, and I -- I certainly still do now. 

00:10:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. What is it that frustrates you about him? 

00:10:35
LETICIA I feel like he doesn't change the way I want him to. 

00:10:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, that's how fathers are. But your smile is a very knowing smile. Well, it's -- it's interesting how knowing you looked then and how perplexed you seem a -- a good bit of the time, when you may be a more knowing person than you know. 

00:11:05
LETICIA Sometimes it's hard to apply my knowledge to this particular relationship. 

00:11:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, I'd like to know what's hard about it. What is it that is causing you the trouble? 

00:11:15
LETICIA Well, I want to believe that he can change, because he's told me that he has changed. 

00:11:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Changed what? All this so far is very abstract. You understand? 

00:11:25
LETICIA Um-hum. 

00:11:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER And I think one of the problems in living is how you change some abstraction into the details and into the real events that, uh -- that guide your life. 

00:11:40
LETICIA Right. 

00:11:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER And I -- I think you're stuck in the abstractions. 

00:11:45
LETICIA So I think I -- he -- 

00:11:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, you smile about that, but I don't know that you really understood what I said. 

00:11:50
LETICIA Well, and I -- I mean, to get into specifics -- we have half an hour, so -- 

00:11:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER No, but did you understand what I said to you, that you may be more knowing than you know and that you behave perplexed when there's quite a bit that you probably know, and that you become abstract and then you can't really confirm anything you know? 

00:12:15
LETICIA So I need to be more concrete to know -- 

00:12:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER You -- 

00:12:20
LETICIA --what I know? 

00:12:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Indeed. You got it. 

00:12:20
LETICIA Okay. Thank you. 

00:12:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Now the question is can you do it? 

00:12:25
LETICIA I'll try. 

00:12:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER But I'm not going to -- I'm not going to crack the whip, but -- but, uh, okay. 

00:12:35
LETICIA So, to be more concrete -- 

00:12:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah? 

00:12:40
LETICIA -- I -- he -- he was an abusive father, and -- 

00:12:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER An abusive father. It's another abstraction. Now, this man apparently abused you. What did he do? Why would you call him an abusive father instead of telling me what he did? 

00:13:00
LETICIA He -- 

00:13:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER I'm not scolding you, you understand. 

00:13:00
LETICIA Yeah. 

00:13:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER But I think that we have to cut through the red tape in a short session. 

00:13:05
LETICIA He was -- he would say things on purpose to make me feel badly. 

00:13:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Like what? 

00:13:10
LETICIA Uh, he used to make fun of me crying all the time. He said I was too emotional and -- 

00:13:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh. Oh, what a fool he was. Your emotions are beautiful. I love it when you smile. Um, unfortunately, I don't know whether you really appreciate your smile, because it comes fairly automatically and I don't know whether you really realize what a blessing it is to be able to do that. 

00:13:40
LETICIA I've been told. 

00:13:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Have you been told? 

00:13:40
LETICIA Yes. 

00:13:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Did you believe? 

00:13:40
LETICIA Yes. 

00:13:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay. 

00:13:45
LETICIA I've been blessed to have other people that believe in my smile, other than him. 

00:13:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay. All right. But he says you are too emotional. 

00:13:50
LETICIA Yes. 

00:13:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER And -- and he would scold you, or what? 

00:13:55
LETICIA He would scold -- he would make fun of me. I mean, he would make jokes about it. He would call me -- 

00:14:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Like -- 

00:14:00
LETICIA -- uh, like the poor little bunny; I'm always crying about these things, and I -- 

00:14:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Poor little bunny? 

00:14:05
LETICIA It kind of sounds like it might be cute, but it wasn't cute. It was -- it was, um -- 

00:14:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER It's really derogatory? 

00:14:15
LETICIA It was derogatory and I -- he wanted me to be more tough. 

00:14:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER He wanted you to be tough? 

00:14:15
LETICIA Yeah. 

00:14:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Ah. Uh-huh. I'll bet he'd rue the day if you ever took his lesson. 

00:14:30
LETICIA I think so. 

00:14:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Can you be tough? 

00:14:30
LETICIA I am tough. 

00:14:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, you are? I wouldn't have known that. How -- in what way? 

00:14:40
LETICIA Well, I think, in my relationship with him. I mean, I reached a point where I -- I just drew the line in the sand and said, 'I don't like the way our relationship is, so I'm not going to have a relationship with you right now.' 

00:14:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, and how did you say that? 

00:14:55
LETICIA Uh, kind of what I just said to you. I called him up and I said -- 

00:15:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER That sounds, uh, like a -- a strong decision, but it doesn't sound tough. When I think of tough -- remember, I grew up in the days of Dead End Kids. 

00:15:15
LETICIA Well, I mean, I guess what we're talking about is what the definition of tough is. 

00:15:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. What were also talking about is whether you can experience your strength, irrespective of whether you call it tough or not, and whether that strength can support you with your father, without having to make him become somebody he's not going to become. Is it possible that your father is not going to change? 

00:15:40
LETICIA Yes. 

00:15:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Is it likely? 

00:15:40
LETICIA Yes. 

00:15:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes. So that's -- that's the reality, then. Do you mind a little reality? 

00:15:50
LETICIA No, not at all. 

00:15:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay. So what do you do? Knowing -- you've got a father you want a relationship with, and he is as he is. What do you do with a guy like that? 

00:16:00
LETICIA I think, if I want a relationship with him, I have to accept it. 

00:16:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, what does it mean to accept it? Does that mean you have to suddenly, uh, uh, be victim of his, uh, uh, uh, teasing you or such? 

00:16:20
LETICIA Well, that's my dilemma. That's why I'm perplexed about it. 

00:16:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, I'm glad we reached where your dilemma -- tell me -- put some words to that dilemma. 

00:16:25
LETICIA Well, because to negotiate a relationship with him where I say -- you know, when he does something that I don't like, when he teases me or -- 

00:16:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:16:35
LETICIA -- when he teases my profession, you know, when he calls me a shrink -- 

00:16:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Now you got an ally. 

00:16:45
LETICIA -- um, to say in that moment -- 

00:16:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER He teases your profession? That's a pretty big tease. What does he say? 

00:16:50
LETICIA Well, he's a molecular biologist, so he doesn't -- he doesn't think psychology is a real science. 

00:17:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER And do you need him to? 

00:17:00
LETICIA Well, no, because I have a lot of -- I would want -- I want him to. 

00:17:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER You want him to, yeah. 

00:17:10
LETICIA Yeah, of course. 

00:17:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Why? You say "Of course." Why? 

00:17:10
LETICIA Cuz he's my father and I want his blessing. 

00:17:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER That's no connection. Fathers don't always like what their daughter are doing. 

00:17:20
LETICIA He doesn't have to like -- 

00:17:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER My father never knew what I was doing. 

00:17:25
LETICIA He doesn't have to like it. I want him to respect it, though. 

00:17:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Why? 

00:17:30
LETICIA Because I -- I feel like my profession is who I am, and I want him to respect me. 

00:17:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Your profession is who you are? 

00:17:35
LETICIA Part of who I am. 

00:17:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Part. That's a big difference. Let's make a distinction. Yeah. How do you feel about the way I'm talking to you? 

00:17:50
LETICIA I like it. 

00:17:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER You like it? Uh, it's, uh -- um, it's calling some things in you into question? 

00:18:00
LETICIA I feel like it's a gentle examination. 

00:18:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER It's a -- 

00:18:05
LETICIA I feel like you're examining. You know, like, there's part of you that's really seeing things -- 

00:18:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, but -- 

00:18:10
LETICIA -- pretty clearly -- 

00:18:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- but this kind -- 

00:18:10
LETICIA -- and you're doing it -- 

00:18:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. But, still, I'm not being gentle, and yet you are quite up to what I'm being. Now, what so different? I mean, why can't you be up to your father being not gentle? 

00:18:25
LETICIA Because, he's -- I -- 

00:18:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER 'My father'. 

00:18:25
LETICIA Yeah. Because he's -- he's been, um -- to me he's not gentle in -- in making fun of me. That's -- there is no gentleness there for me. 

00:18:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:18:35
LETICIA It's malicious. 

00:18:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, but you are not a child anymore, and what the impact he could have on you then is not the same as it has to have now. How does that sound to you? 

00:18:55
LETICIA That's sounds -- it's -- it's the truth, and thank goodness. 

00:19:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:19:00
LETICIA I think that it's -- there's a part of me that's the principle of the thing. 

00:19:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Ah, there we -- 

00:19:05
LETICIA I have to fight, you know. 

00:19:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER That's -- 

00:19:05
LETICIA Like, I have to have vengeance for the five-year old who couldn't. 

00:19:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER It's incredible insight you just had. Do you realize that? If you could say it again so that you'd really know you said it? Say it again. Can you remember what you said? It's been 30 seconds. 

00:19:25
LETICIA I remember. Cuz I have to fight it. It's the principle of the thing. That -- 

00:19:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:19:30
LETICIA That's how I feel about it -- 

00:19:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:19:30
LETICIA -- that I -- I somehow am getting vengeance for Leticia, the child -- 

00:19:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Right. 

00:19:35
LETICIA -- in the present day. 

00:19:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Right. Boy, you hit it. Yeah. How does it feel to have said that? 

00:19:50
LETICIA It feels -- I mean, it's -- it's -- you -- it's a -- it's a big deal that I said it. It feels like something that bears thinking about. 

00:20:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER How big of a deal is it, on a scale of, let's say, one to ten? 

00:20:05
LETICIA I feel like it's probably about a nine. 

00:20:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, yeah, that's great. Yeah. 

00:20:10
LETICIA Because it's really at the heart of -- 

00:20:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Yeah. 

00:20:15
LETICIA -- our relationship. 

00:20:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER So then what do we have to do once we know that? 

00:20:15
LETICIA I -- I somehow need to figure out how to recon -- how to somehow not -- how to reconcile that, or maybe I don't really want to -- want vengeance -- 

00:20:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER There's -- 

00:20:30
LETICIA -- with him. 

00:20:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- something deep inside of you that wants it, and something that does -- that knows it's of no use to you, it's really old stale business. What I'm very interested in is not only whether you solve this with your father, because that's important but it's not crucial; what is more important is whether it's affecting you anywhere else, this need for vengeance, this sense of vulnerability to being diminished or such as that. That's a larger part of your life. Let's not make your father the whole of your life. What do you think? 

00:21:20
LETICIA I think that it has huge ramifications for my life. 

00:21:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Huge, yes, yes. Would you be willing to speak about that? 

00:21:30
LETICIA Well, I think in some ways, being able to -- um, to accept criticism, to accept feedback and to also -- when people in my life are -- are being mean or are -- you know, are -- are kind of treating me that way, to be able to kind of write it off and put it in the place that it needs to be. 

00:21:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, give it a conte -- 

00:21:50
LETICIA Not to give it too much importance. 

00:21:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, the right context. Yeah. Well said. 

00:21:55
LETICIA And I think also being able to accept the part of me that is somewhat like him, and by "someone like him", the part of him -- me that does want vengeance, and say it's okay to be a little bit of a warrior around this; like, it's -- it's okay to feel like you want vengeance. 

00:22:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER A warrior, yes. So there is a warrior in you. 

00:22:15
LETICIA Yes. 

00:22:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. My gosh, I'm discovering new people all the time right in front of my eyes. One would never know right away. But I like feeling the warrior in you. You know, the warrior in you makes me feel secure, because if you are the warrior, I don't have to worry about how I treat you. 

00:22:45
LETICIA  What do you mean by that? 

00:22:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Your laughter makes me think you know something of what I mean by it. What do you think I mean by it? 

00:23:00
LETICIA Well, my first thought was, 'Oh my gosh, is he going to start being really mean to me and see how I react?' 

00:23:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER No, no, I've been as about as mean to you as I'm going to be, you know, which some people would have found mean already, but you didn't. And there's something of the strength of the warrior that lets me know that you'll take care of yourself; you're not going to give a shit what I say to you every minute of the time; that you've got a being beyond me and beyond your father, even though you may want to be with him and be with me, which is quite possible. How do you think your father would feel if you were not so, um, vulnerable to his style? 

00:23:50
LETICIA If I was not so vulnerable to what he thought, you mean, or -- 

00:23:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER No, no. Not so vulnerable to his teasing or -- or -- uh, I've forgotten the word you used before. 

00:24:00
LETICIA Well, I think that there's a certain respect in him. I mean, I have a twin sister who got similar treatment, and -- 

00:24:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh. 

00:24:10
LETICIA -- she reacted in a much different way. 

00:24:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh. 

00:24:10
LETICIA And I saw a lot of respect for him towards her because she always stood up to him. 

00:24:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes. Yes. Yes. So you have to find some way of what you call standing up that's not just a class action but your individuated standing up. What would you like to say to your father that would represent you standing up to him? 

00:24:40
LETICIA I would like to say to him, 'I want to have a relationship with you. And now that I'm an adult, I want that relationship to be partly on my terms.' 

00:24:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Can you feel how your chin juts up and you reached up a little bit? Oh, if we could get that into your voice, it would help. That same quality in your chin, if you could say it and fit that chin quality, I'd like to hear that. Try it. 

00:25:10
LETICIA "I want a relationship, and I want it on my own terms." 

00:25:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Uh-huh. Let's try just a little more accentuation, if you don't mind. Say it and do something that would accentuate it, punctuate it. Like, stamp your foot or hit the -- hit the couch or -- or go like that, or something that would accentuate the feeling. I want you to feel it instead of just going through motions. 

00:25:40
LETICIA "I want a relationship, and I want it on my own terms." 

00:25:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER  And how did that feel? 

00:25:55
LETICIA It feels good. 

00:25:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Good in what way? 

00:26:00
LETICIA It feels powerful -- 

00:26:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Powerful. 

00:26:05
LETICIA -- in a way that I'm comfortable with being powerful. 

00:26:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. That you were comfortable with that. Lovely. Okay, now what next would you like to say to your father? 

00:26:20
LETICIA  What my terms are. 

00:26:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay. 

00:26:30
LETICIA And I guess I'm less certain about what those are. That's part of the problem. 

00:26:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, yeah, that's very important, because your terms are not, uh -- not reachable. Your terms are that he not be like he is. 

00:26:45
LETICIA Hmm. 

00:26:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER That's what you want him to do, to change what he is, and those terms -- they don't work. Let's see if we can find some other terms. Think of anything? 

00:27:05
LETICIA I feel like we could maybe negotiate my terms in specifics in terms of comments or -- I mean, he cries in front of me now, and that annoys me. 

00:27:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Oh, my God. What a reversal. You're complaining because he didn't let you cry as a kid, and now the guy comes around and he takes a lesson from you, the teacher, and he's crying and you say 'What are you doing? Crying?' 

00:27:40
LETICIA I don't -- I have never said that to him. I've never -- 

00:27:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER No, no, you didn't say it. He cries. What an incredible development. And what do you say to him while he's crying? 

00:28:00
LETICIA Well, usually I comfort him because it brings out this rescuer part of me. You know, someone's crying, and I go to try to make him feel better. 

00:28:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Rescuer part? I mean, that's got to be classified also, right? It's not enough to console him when he's crying, or -- 

00:28:15
LETICIA Well, I feel like it is more -- it's not totally based on our relationship, because I'm not being genuine, like I just said. Inside I'm thinking, 'What a hypocrite, and he's been manipulative.' But outside I'm saying, 'Oh, it's okay. 

00:28:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, but, uh, actually your sense of being phony -- or what do you call it? Manipulative, or -- no, you didn't say that. 

00:28:40
LETICIA Uh, being disingenuous -- 

00:28:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Disingenuous. 

00:28:40
LETICIA -- or insincere. 

00:28:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Well, but the thing is there are moments of authenticity that stick through the ingenuousness, and you mustn't knock em off just because it's not the whole story. So I want to know about your reactions to his crying. Now, what did you say? You -- uh, you talked about being the rescuer, but what did you do? 

00:29:05
LETICIA Well, the last time he cried in front of me, I went over and, you know, put my arms around him and -- 

00:29:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER You really did. Can you say that to me: 'Erv, you know, I really put my arms around my dad; I really did'? 

00:29:25
LETICIA I really put my arms around my dad; I really did. 

00:29:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Convince me. That was not convincing. 

00:29:30
LETICIA I put my arms around my dad; I did. 

00:29:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes. Yes. Yes. And did he receive you? 

00:29:40
LETICIA Yes. 

00:29:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes. How did he receive you? 

00:29:45
LETICIA He put his arms around me. 

00:29:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, beautiful. Do you know that in a million years, I would not have dreamed that this ever went on? And it did go on. It sounds quite beautiful. Can you encompass the beauty of that? 

00:30:00
LETICIA  I have a hard time doing that. 

00:30:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, because there's part of you that it doesn't fit with. Like, you won't feel whole. Like, it's a fragmentation; that so much of you is still indignant and angry that the love doesn't fit. And everybody wants to feel whole. Where did you put this? Where do you put this love? 

00:30:25
LETICIA That's really -- what you just said is -- 

00:30:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER  What? 

00:30:30
LETICIA I appreciate what you just said, because -- 

00:30:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes. 

00:30:30
LETICIA -- I -- that is something that I haven't realized before -- 

00:30:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes. 

00:30:35
LETICIA -- that there isn't a space for our love. 

00:30:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes. Yes. You can't change your whole being in order to encompass this thing that you have and want which doesn't quite fit your whole being. That, if you can receive it, will change the rest, in time; not right away. If you can allow that love to have its own reality, without requiring that it, uh, redo your lifetime -- yeah. Yeah. I think you would be good to have for a daughter, and your father must know it. 

00:31:15
LETICIA He does. He knows it. 

00:31:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER He does know it? Ah. Yeah. How does it feel to say that? 

00:31:30
LETICIA  I know that he knows it. 

00:31:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER You know that he knows it? 

00:31:35
LETICIA As you said, I mean, this part of me knows that -- 

00:31:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:31:40
LETICIA -- he knows it. 

00:31:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay. One part you knows it; the other part knows it. And now I know it. And now all those people out there know it. We all know it. Maybe that'll help you to know it even more fully. Yes. Try to say what's inside of you to say. 

00:32:05
LETICIA  I think I have, uh, some hard -- or some challenging things ahead of me with my relationship with him. 

00:32:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER The challenge is what? 

00:32:25
LETICIA To create a space for our relationship and for that love and -- 

00:32:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER  The challenge is to accept the love before you make the whole change, not after you make it. You know what I mean? The love that's there will build into changing the rest of you. But if you think you have to change the rest of you first, it's going to be a long, long journey. 

00:32:55
LETICIA  It has been. 

00:33:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. You can shortcut it right now. Can you say something that would fit the shortcut, even though it doesn't take account of the entire problem? If you can't, I'll help you with it. 

00:33:20
LETICIA My father is incredibly proud of the fact that I'm going to have my master's. 

00:33:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh. Yes. Yes. Beautiful. Uh-huh. And can you accept that? Can you feel it anywhere in your body? 

00:33:45
[sil.] 

00:33:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. It's almost making you cry. Yeah. Can you yield to the cry, say yes? 

00:34:05
[sil.] 

00:34:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Yeah. You do feel it, but it's not going to come out yet. It doesn't have to. It doesn't have to. But I feel the wetness in you. I feel the -- the wish for the openness, a wish to get rid of the grudge, to let the new enter into you. Yeah. Now, what would you like to say to me? 

00:34:50
LETICIA  Thank you. 

00:34:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER "Thank you." Yeah. 

00:35:00
LETICIA I'm, uh, really impressed that how many ever other sessions of therapy that I was in around him, which was useful, um, that you've helped me think about things -- 

00:35:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:35:20
LETICIA -- in a completely different way, and -- 

00:35:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:35:20
LETICIA -- I -- I think you know how much of a gift that is. 

00:35:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes. But you have to know that you're the one who's doing it. I just noticed it. You're already making the progress. Let it -- let it guide you. Thank you very much. 

00:35:40
LETICIA Thank you. 

00:35:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay. 

00:35:45
[sil.] 

00:35:45
LETICIA  Thank you so much. 

00:35:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes. 

00:35:50
LETICIA That was amazing. 

00:36:00
[sil.] 

00:36:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Okay, uh, anybody wanna start the discussion? Uh, I -- is it okay with us -- with you if we -- we talk about it now? Okay. If there's anything that we -- if there's anything we bring up that you don't want to deal with, just say so. Um, what about the combination of technique and, um -- and, for want of a better word, humanity, and it's not really quite the right word, but ordinariness - that's a better word for it - technique and ordinariness, like any two people having a conversation might -- might do? Yeah? 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:37:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, are we -- how do we work this about -- 

00:37:05
UNKNOWN Where's the microphone? 

00:37:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- the microphones? 

00:37:15
[sil.] 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN  Any questions, microphone is right here. And it's on the other side as well. 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN Dr. Polster? 

00:37:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah? 

00:37:35
UNKNOWN I was curious; how did you make the decision to go with working with the sadness as opposed to the aggression? 

00:37:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER I have never made that decision. 

00:37:45
UNKNOWN But you sensed that there were two routes that you could take? 

00:37:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Um, I think we went both routes. We dealt with the toughness. I -- the toughness came with, um -- I don't remember. Um, didn't she say that her father was tough? 

00:38:05
UNKNOWN Um-hum. 

00:38:05
UNKNOWN She wanted to cry. 

00:38:05
UNKNOWN Felt like she was picked on, so cut him off. 

00:38:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Oh, yeah, so she was tough with him. But her toughness with him was, uh -- it wasn't what I would consider toughness. It was, uh, in the arena, but it was intellectualized and neutralized. Uh, it wasn't a toughness that just stands up against the other person. It's a toughness that leaves the other person. There's a difference between standing up to somebody and leaving them. Now, leaving could be a representation of toughness in some circumstances, but I didn't feel like that was a good, uh, uh, way to describe it for her. And as far as the, uh -- the sadness, that just came, that came with her realization that the love was there. When she got past her abstractions about her father, into the details of her relationship with him and her activities with him, she came up with the idea that he really -- he cried, he, uh, received her consolation, he embraced her in return. A lovely experience. And I think there's something about the lost beauty that brings tears. People cry when they're suddenly in pleasure; and not always, but, I mean, there's something about, when you cry or something beautiful happens, you know that this has what not happened. So you have that pleasure but simultaneously you have a feeling, 'Well, this hasn't happened. I'm so glad to have had it, but why haven't I had it?', the sadness of never having had it. But the sadness was intermingled through her realization of the, uh, warmth and the love that existed. I think it's a good example of how, um, abstractions can, um, dilute experience; that once you have the abstraction of a person being such and such a person, then, if it's strong enough of an abstraction, you don't really notice or give -- pay enough attention to the exceptions to that abstraction. That's why it's so important to get to the details of what people do. Does that answer your question? 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:40:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay. 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN Uh, Dr. Polster, I don't have a question. I have a comment that your -- uh, from -- from my experience. Hello, I'm over here. 

00:40:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, okay. Oh -- 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN I just wanted to thank you for your -- 

00:41:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, yes, yes. 

00:41:00
LETICIA I want to thank you for being you and being the same humane person I knew many years ago, and your fatherly nature that you brought out with your warmth and heart, was able to engage her in her other aspect of how she viewed her father, because of your fatherly nature and your beauty. And I want to thank you for reminding me of that. 

00:41:30
[sil.] 

00:41:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, bless your heart. I -- uh, as far as being me is concerned, is there another option? 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN  Dr Polster, what a privilege. It's like -- 

00:41:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER I can't -- I can't -- oh. 

00:41:50
UNKNOWN What -- what a privilege to, uh, even be in your presence. And -- and my first thought was, are you available and willing for adoption? 

00:42:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER You mean am I to be adopted -- 

00:42:00
UNKNOWN No -- 

00:42:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- or do I adopt you? 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN -- would you adopt me? Yes. Um, I think a lot of -- of women have had some issue with fathers, whatever it would be. And -- and your -- as this woman just said, your kind -- woops -- kind and gentle nature is, um -- um, very -- it helps heal a lot of ills without even dealing with the father-figure issue, um, just because of who you are. And I also appreciate -- the question I really have for you is, I'm just finishing my first year of grad school. I'm just a baby, yeah, in this field, although I've worked for people for many, many years, um, mostly children, uh, adolescents. But I am struck at your ability, and I realized you've been doing this a very long time -- 

00:42:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER How long would you say? 

00:42:55
UNKNOWN Well I'm thinking probably at least 20 or 30 years, 40 years, (inaudible ) -- 

00:43:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Twenty or 30 years. 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN -- pushing it. Um -- 

00:43:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER That's -- yeah? 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN I'm struck at your ability to be present, um, listening-wise and be very present with your, uh, client, and also being able to notice and bring up the physical attributes, um, that you're seeing. And I'm wondering -- I have a difficult time doing that. I -- when I'm sitting in a session, I'm doing the best I can to be intent, um, on listening and hearing. And I have a difficult time being able to do the visual as well as the oral at the same time. And -- and I'm struck by your expertise at that. And can you give some guidance on how that might be done better? 

00:43:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER I don't know about that, but I can address the question. I think it's a very big question, because, uh, to combine different modalities, like verbal communication and bodily experience, and then the experiment of talking to your father, combining all of that, it can be very disruptive. And if you're talking to someone and suddenly you ask them 'What are you feeling inside?', my sense is, 'What are you asking me that for? Here I'm telling you something important, and you're going to ask me what's going on in my body.' Well -- so it's a problem how to coordinate them. And I can't tell you exactly how to do it, but to have a respect for the timing of it makes a difference. So if you're concerned with what's happening in her body and you don't feel the timing is quite right, you could say, 'Look, I'm listening to you very carefully, and I'm -- I'm -- I'm so interested in what you're saying, but I can't help being also, uh, involved with whether you're -- you know, you look like you're feeling something very deeply in your body. I don't know how to ask you that. And -- uh, so I don't want to interrupt you but, at the same time, I'm interrupting you. But can you understand? I'd like to know what's going in your body.' Well, by that time we'll both not be interested anymore. But you know what I mean? The -- the -- the -- the whole question of transition is crucial to a, uh -- a whole experience; otherwise it's very choppy, fragmented. And when your mind, which is presumably synchronous with another person's mind, and you're not quite sure that you're making it in that synchrony, then how do you -- how do you deal with it? Well, sometimes you deal with it, uh, awkwardly, sometimes you make a mistake, but always with an eye toward that doesn't mean that the range of a person's experience is both bodily, verbal, uh, experimental, whatever it might be, that they're all important and that you have to find a way of -- of integrating them. Now, if -- but if you develop a relationship with a person, they'll forgive you if you make a mistake. I -- 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN Thank you very much. 

00:46:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Okay. 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN  What were you feeling in the session? And -- I'm over here. 

00:46:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:46:15
UNKNOWN And, uh, is that -- was what you were feeling important, important in your work in the way in which you-- 

00:46:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, what I was -- yeah. What I was feeling was very important but not in terms of my describing my feelings. It was important in terms of, uh, uh, a very full absorption with her. I mean, it's as though I was drinking her in and she was all of my world. So the feeling of that -- I have some sense of, uh -- some sense of adventure, some sense of, uh, the pleasure of relationship, some sense of, uh, uh, this, uh, invitation to the depths of another person's mind, which is quite an invitation. So all of that gets registered in my union with her, but it's not a matter of, well, am I feeling, um, some sensations in my body, or am I feeling anger, or am I feeling love or -- those things are not what I become -- what I was aware of. But I was aware of this person looked to me like she had everything she wants, that she -- you know, everything that she needs to get what she wants, and doesn't know it and, if I could only introduce her to herself, I would be so grateful. 

00:47:45
UNKNOWN Um-hum. Thanks. 

00:47:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Let me say another word about -- you know, I said to the person over there something about 'If you're a little off, the person will forgive you.' Another part of that is if you're -- if you have a relational synchronicity with another person, you don't have to be that good, because they'll take it the next step. If they feel a yes-ness and of-course-ness with you, an invitation together, I'll say one thing and they'll pick it up and say the next. Now, we had some of that relationship but not a lot of it, in the sense that she doesn't know me very well and, you know, it's a strange situation. But I do remember one time when, uh, I was -- I was doing a workshop, um, and the people who invited me invited me -- they were exploring psychic experience. I said, 'I don't know anything about psychic experience.' They said, 'That's okay. You just do what you do.' So I came in. And when I started the group, there was this one guy. And I've said this in another group just a little while ago. I'm a little repetitive; I can't separate what I'm doing in one place from another. But the, um -- I -- I -- I looked at this guy, and here's this -- he's got this -- this turban that was about 18 inches high, white. And he's apple-cheeked, light hair, all-American boy. And I said to him, 'You look like you got caught in a rodeo, that someone had gauze instead of rope and wrapped it around your head and went like that and made a turban out of it.' And he says, 'How did you know?' Well, what -- what he meant was metaphorically. But he took it the next step and he said, 'Yes, I was lassoed into this cult. My wife is deeply embedded in it, and I didn't want to rock the boat. And they had me in an alley, talking to me about it, and I finally said okay, and here I am.' Well, all I'm saying is he made what I said work, because if you say something to somebody that has some merit, you don't have to be exactly right. The other person will know how it works, if you're in synchronicity with each other; if you're not, of course they'll just be -- it won't go anywhere. So it's important to depend on that kind of synchronicity and the idea that you don't have to do it all, the other person will take it a large part of the way. Any other -- 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN Over here. Excuse me. Over here, to your left. 

00:50:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, okay. 

00:51:00
UNKNOWN Hi. Um, in my experience with the field of therapy, I -- I feel, in ways, we've taken unconditional positive regard and distorted it and become soft. And you seem to have a real gift. And -- and when I was watching you, you -- you asked her what her experience was with you, and I -- and I felt adversity, and it was an adversity for her in -- in -- for her it was almost evocative in getting her to think in her terms, in her experiences. And it seems like you have a gift of helping people see the things how they don't want to see, in a way that they feel good about it. And so what -- what I'm wondering is -- I think I I kind of answered that with the synchronicity. Um, and I'm just wondering how you've managed to develop that and in what -- what process you feel you do. 

00:51:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER I think it's -- I have a poor memory, so I don't know what I was a while ago. But, uh, no, there is something very important. Somebody said how gentle I was. Well, yeah, I'm -- I'm gentle, but I can be a tough-ass guy. 

00:52:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:52:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER And, uh, I don't take it lightly, though. I don't do it indiscriminately. But there is something about combining a diversity of characteristics that gives you leverage, because then people can't classify you as easily; they can take your words easily just for their own sake. And that quality of taking anything seriously just for its own sake is principally what we're trying to lead people into, to be able to do that and transcend the classifications of existence. Okay. 

00:52:40
UNKNOWN  Dr Polster -- I'm -- I'm over here on your right. 

00:52:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:52:45
UNKNOWN At this conference, um, particularly in terms of trauma, what I hear a lot of people talking about - we all talk about this - is that in terms of cognitive behavioral treatment, that what we need to do is to help people to reorganize their cognitive schema and, uh, you know, this will help them to assimilate the experience that they've had and become habituated to it. And then on the other side I hear, uh, 'No, we should be using EMDR and this will help people get in touch with their feelings about it, and then they'll process it and work through it.' And what occurs to me is that this sounds like what gestalt therapists have been doing for years and years, but no one seems to be acknowledging that. And I'm wondering if you think that's true and why is it that no one's talking about it. 

00:53:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, I -- I can't give you the exact answer, but I -- I -- I know when I first came into gestalt therapy, which was in, excuse me, uh, 1953, and -- and there were a couple of, uh -- I -- I'd been in a couple of workshops, and one of my friends in town, who was also a psychologist, said, uh, 'This gestalt therapy thing, do you think it's a thing of the future?' And I said, 'Yeah, I absolutely think it's a thing of the future, but I don't think it'll be called gestalt therapy.' And the reason I felt that way was because it was composed of people who are organizationally disinterest -- I mean, disinterested in organization, disint -- there -- there was an -- there was a counterculture mentality that was very rich and that I benefited from greatly and enjoyed, uh, but it doesn't get into the swing of things. And then people began to take Fritz Perls as an example of gestalt therapy; so they take one particular thing out and, if I don't do an empty chair, people think I'm not doing gestalt therapy. There's never a moment when I am not doing gestalt therapy. Whatever you see me doing is gestalt therapy. Why do I say that? Because what you do is what emerges from the orientation you get from a theory, not from the copying of particular procedures or techniques. So the concept of the contact boundary, uh, enables me to be in connection with a person and to be joined with them in a way that a boundary -- which is always held in mutuality between one and the other part of that which is bounded. And their awareness is in a tremendous expansion from the concept of insight, because insight happens occasionally. Awareness happens every moment. And then the experiment, which means that you take something that's going on and you build it into an activity, a tryout you might say, is fundamental to gestalt therapy. Many people are doing it now in many ways, and rightfully so. And I -- I don't even know that it's influenced by gestalt therapy, because there's a parallel, there's -- in the -- in the community of psychotherapists and the culture at large on any particular issue, things happen simultaneously. The concept of empathy was held by Carl Rogers and Kohut. Simultaneously they were both in the same city and they don't even know each other. Or there's some confusion about that, but -- so I can't tell you the answer, uh, except that that's part of the answer. 

00:56:25
UNKNOWN Thanks so much. 

00:56:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay. We -- two minutes. One more question? 

00:56:30
UNKNOWN  I wanted to ask as a developing -- Dr Polster, hi. 

00:56:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Over there. 

00:56:40
UNKNOWN As a clinician still very new to the field, um, I find myself always wondering about the roads not taken by the masters and when I watch a session. And I was very intrigued by not following or not directly following what seemed to me expressions of anger. Um, and I so could be projecting in this situation, because that session was very familiar. But, um, like -- um -- 

00:57:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Well, that's a very interest -- I want to address that point in a moment. 

00:57:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, I could probably stop there. But, um, like, even when she mentioned her father crying, she experienced it, at least part of her, as manipulative and as not genuine, and that sounded just full of anger to me. And instead you took -- you moved and -- or helped her move towards resolution and towards experiencing the love. And I found -- I would -- I found myself wondering how I would have known which way to go. 

00:57:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, the fact is that every one of us doing a session would go in a different way; not meaning that one way is the way. So if I were to do the session again, if you could possibly imagine a situation where we start afresh from the beginning, I would do it differently. You don't do it the same way. And you can't do everything. But I'm aware of the anger underneath; she was aware of it also. And I'm aware of that anger; it was a part of the background of intrusion into her present experience. So sometimes you have to get rid of that background and get the anger out before anything can possibly happen. But here she is where it's happening already, and she needs the support of what she can already do for what she wants to do. So the main idea is, again, catch a person doing it right and build on it, and let them have the support from the success and the appreciation that they can't handle everything all at once. 

00:58:50
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:58:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay. Thank you.
