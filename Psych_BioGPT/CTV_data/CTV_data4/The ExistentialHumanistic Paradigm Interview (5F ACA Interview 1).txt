3rd Force: The Existential/Humanistic Paradigm Interview Mark B. Scholl, Ph.D., Associate Professor Eastern Carolina University 

00:00:00
INTERVIEWER Well, thank you, Dr. Scholl for taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with me to talk about, uh, existential humanistic counseling as the third wave or the third force in the counseling profession. I know you've been really active in sort of helping shape this particular, uh, wave in, in the counseling field by being involved as the Journal editor or the past editor of the Journal of Humanistic Counseling, Education and Development. And also with your recent publication of the book, "Humanistic Perspectives on Contemporary Counseling Issues". Uh, and also serving as president elect of the Association for Humanistic Counseling, uh, for the 2012? 

00:01:10
DR. MARK SCHOLL Yeah. That's right. 

00:01:10
INTERVIEWER Academic year. And so, you've really been instrumental, uh, from what I can see, in terms of helping to shape this particular movement, if you will, as a third force in the field. I'm pretty excited about being able to interview you and, and really getting some insight in terms of what existential humanistic counseling is really all about. Uh, what does it look like? How do you operationalize this third force in, in the counseling field in practice with clients? I have a series of questions I wanted to begin to sort of start this interview, to sort of give us a understanding of this third wave, if you will, in the field of counseling and psychology. I think I'd like to start by just sort of asking you a little bit in terms of, just if you can give us a little history about existential humanistic counseling as a third force. Sort of, how did it evolve? 

00:02:00
DR. MARK SCHOLL It goes back out, it goes back all the way to the beginnings of, of recorded time when people would ask questions, such as what, what does life mean? What is the meaning of life? Why are we here? You know, what is our significance? But, in terms of, uh, a more formal definition, it began with Kierkegaard right after World War II, uh, who wrote "The Concept of Dread". And in that book, Kierkegaard sort of, uh, rebelling against, uh, notions of people as being more mechanized, uh, and saying we needed to take more introspective view of humanity, a view that's more person centered. And certainly, Kierkegaard informed Carl Rogers' person centered counseling. And, uh, you can also see Carl Rogers person centered counseling as being a reaction to behaviorism, which is, which is very very mechanized, and, uh, psychoanalysis which is pessimistic and, and certainly does not emphasize by any means our, our freedom of choice and action. 

00:03:20
INTERVIEWER So, it sounds like you're saying the humanistic existential counseling perspective really takes more of a strength-based perspective, would you say? 

00:03:30
DR. MARK SCHOLL Absolutely. It's much more optimistic. It's much more emphasis placed on human potential. But, I think it's really, uh, important to, to draw a distinction between the American brand of humanistic psychology and the European roots. Whereas the Europeans, uh, were not quite as pragmatic as Carl Rogers would be viewed. Whereas Carl Rogers was interested in fostering, uh, human potential, the European tradition is more interested in looking at, uh, crisis and really deep existential themes like a death and meaning. And so it can be perceived as darker in some respects, more of an emphasis on existential anxiety, because you have this freedom of choice and this power to construct meaning and your own identity. It can be very, uh, overwhelming for person. 

00:04:35
INTERVIEWER Who would you say, you mentioned Carl Rogers as one of the significant figures in terms of helping to really put this movement on the map, if you will. Uh, are there other significant figures that, uh, you think you have really helped shape this particular movement in the field of counseling and psychology? 

00:04:55
DR. MARK SCHOLL Well, you know, somebody who comes to mind immediately is, is Victor Frankel in "Man's Search for Meaning", and his experience of, of being in the concentration camp and, and having the courage to put a positive spin on that and say, uh, I'm responsible and have the freedom to choose my response to this condition. And out of that came logotherapy and the idea that we can construct meaning in our lives. Someone else that comes to mind is Abraham Maslow and his descriptions of people who are self actualizing as kind of like a exemplars of what people are capable of becoming. 

00:05:40
INTERVIEWER What has your interest been in this particular movement? How did you get involved, because I know you're pretty active in this particular field. 

00:05:50
DR. MARK SCHOLL I started out, you know, in a Masters program at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. And I've always been a follower of Carl Rogers. I think a lot of us are. You know, when we first get started the micro skills and the therapeutic attitudes, a lot of us just gravitate towards Carl Rogers. Uh, and it's really really interesting because, uh, I guess it, it goes with my tendency to be very optimistic and forward-looking and I developed a technique almost by happenstance. And, it had to do with, uh, a lot of times in the field we are really preoccupied with their resumes, or as we call them our vitaes. And I started to just kind of play around with my vitae and say, what if I did this? What if in five years I've done these things, and this is who I would become? And what if in the next two years after that I did these things? This is what I would look like on paper. And I said, hey, this is kind of a technique. You know, this could be like a real, this could be like a real identity construction technique. And I created a, a cons, a card sort where people look at descriptions, values, interests, tasks and they sort the cards into "like me" and "not like me". And they use those cards to inform a futuristic vision of themselves in the, in the form of a resume. So they have this visual image of who they would like to be in five to seven years. And afterwards I said, that's really in a way, very very existentialist because you have the freedom to do that. You know, you have the freedom to be the author of your identity. And, and before I did that, that was a very. I mean, that was, that was kind of a novel concept for me, before I came up with that idea. 

00:08:10
INTERVIEWER Yeah, it sounds like you've taken sort of, I kind of look at existential and humanistic counseling and psychology as sort of abstract concepts in, in the sense, talking about freedom, meaning, choice, uh, and you've sort of taken those concepts and made them practical in terms of how do you actually apply it in practice. 

00:08:25
DR. MARK SCHOLL Yeah. To, to concretize it in the form of a technique can be very very elusive. Yeah, so, so that wasn't what I set out to do, but afterwards I said, well, this is what it looks like. 

00:08:40
INTERVIEWER It sort of evolved over time, it sounds like, from you as his graduate student learning about rogering(ph) techniques and principles to what it is right now. 

00:08:50
DR. MARK SCHOLL Right, and Maslow's concept of self-actualization, and this idea that you can do this card sort and you can pick and choose what you would include and would not include in your future self. And, what I added to that was, uh, the idea of action steps. So they have to create a plan, uh and action steps for how they plan on becoming that person they've depicted on paper. 

00:09:20
INTERVIEWER I'm interested in what you talked about in terms of action steps with, with this new concept that you have or, or framework in terms of how you implement existential humanistic counseling. It's interesting because when I read a lot about existentialism in humanistic psychology, one of the things that people talk about in terms of its limitations is that it's directionless. It's not really a technique. So I'm sort of interested in your take in terms of just how, uh, do you implement that. Does that make sense? 

00:09:50
DR. MARK SCHOLL It does. It makes sense, and I guess my response to that is when you read, for example, Kirk Schneider, uh, Rollo May. They talk about the different dialectical tensions in existential therapy. And one of them is, is freedom versus discipline. So, so the idea that you have the freedom through the card sort, and I include cards that are blank where you can just write anything you want on a card. There is nothing printed on it. So that sort of represents freedom, but there's also got to be discipline, because they're, they're two sides of the same coin. And so, I think without a genuine commitment, that takes courage, which is another key concept in existentialism. It takes courage, and you've got to commit to these action steps and have some discipline too. So if you air on either side too much, you know, you ruined the whole thing. 

00:10:55
INTERVIEWER So it sounds like you're saying there's a freedom within structure with this technique that you have. There's a structure or framework in place, but there's a freedom to sort of implement that within certain boundaries that I think, as I hear about it, I think for the emergent counselor, uh, that would be really nice for them. I can see where it can sort of alleviate some of their concerns in terms of how do you actually implement existentialism and humanism in my work with clients in a way that makes sense. 

00:11:30
DR. MARK SCHOLL Exactly. 

00:11:30
INTERVIEWER You talked about some of the major figures that have shaped existentialism and humanistic psychology. What would you say are some of the major or significant events, if you will, that you, you think sort of had an influence in, in shaping this particular perspective? 

00:11:50
DR. MARK SCHOLL Yeah, I, I guess you could think of it in terms of events or you could think of it in terms of trends that span long periods of history. But, uh, World War II is one that, you know, really really stands out because, uh, so many things happened in World War II. I mentioned early Victor Frankel's experience. But, there is the rise of Nazism and then in the aftermath people had to do a lot of soul-searching and think how could this happen? How could people be, uh, so cruel and inhumane, and what does this say about the, about human nature? You know, what does this say about the tension between freedom and responsibility? And, how can we underscore that, that people need, uh, to take greater responsibility for their actions. But also to, to own their actions rather than sort of saying in the, in the context of the chain of command, I was just following orders. You know, to say I'm responsible for the choices that I make. So that one really stands out. Uh, the atomic bomb, you know, the invention of the atomic bomb and how destructive that is and how reductionistic it is to say that we can all be reduced to atoms, you know, and elements. I think there's definitely, uh, a raling against that tendency when you look at people like Carl Rogers and saying that we, we can't reduce people to atoms and electrons and neutrons. We have to look at their, at their values and their sense of purpose and meaning in life and their power to create meaning for themselves. 

00:13:45
INTERVIEWER It sounds like what you're saying is often times it's external events that cause us to sort of look in word and really be reflective in terms of where are we act, where do we want to go, who am I. How do I make meaning of all this is a human being, as, as a person? Uh, and so when I think about that, I'm thinking or I'm wondering, is there a level of maturity that's required to really be able to understand existentialism and humanistic psychology and to be able to implement it? 

00:14:20
DR. MARK SCHOLL Yeah, I mean what, what really comes to mind for me is, uh, is a novelist I remember reading talking about the differences between, uh, the top ten books on the, on the American list and the European list and how you see a lot more of the classics on the top ten list in Europe than you do in America. And the idea that we, we tend to read, uh, more for pure enjoyment, whereas there is, I don't know if it's entirely fair, but the Europeans tend to read the classics, and they tended to read weightier, you know, authors. Uh, so in terms of maturity, another thing that comes to mind is this concept of the wounded healer. So the idea that to be an effective existential therapist, uh, you have to have had the crisis yourself and to have resulted in some way, but you are wounded in some way too as a result of that experience. So in order to have credibility and to be effective, you have to have gone through some of these types of experiences that your, your client is currently facing. 

00:15:40
INTERVIEWER I'm curious about what you said, because, or what you're saying, because, and I can see what you're saying in terms of going through an experience like death or crisis can really help you develop a deeper sense of empathy. Uh, my question is for those counselors who not gone through those experiences but really resonate with the existential humanistic perspective, uh, what is your recommendation or, or what thoughts do you have about, uh, folks who sort of fall in that category that want to develop, you know, and operate from an existential humanistic perspective? Does that make sense? 

00:16:20
DR. MARK SCHOLL Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. I think that's a really good idea would be for, for that individual, those individuals to go, go into therapy with an existential therapist because then they can see what it's like from the perspective of a client. But also, they could benefit from, uh, having an existential therapist guide them through the process and have an appreciation for how much courage it requires, you know, and what that crisis is like. And then they, they do in a real sense have credibility because they have gone through the process that they are now facilitating. 

00:17:10
INTERVIEWER I like that because they can sort of see how it looks, see how it's being modeled in the sense, and sort of figure out for themselves does this fit me. 

00:17:20
DR. MARK SCHOLL Yeah, exactly. And, and what's a crisis for this person versus this person, it depends on their subjective experience. So, a crisis could be a career change for them. It's, it doesn't have to be, uh, surviving cancer or something, you know, that serious. 

00:17:40
INTERVIEWER In terms of key concepts within this particular wave in counseling and psychology, what would you say they are? You mentioned some of them: meaning, choice, freedom. 

00:17:50
DR. MARK SCHOLL Let's see. One that comes to mind is the idea that each of us has an inauthentic mode and an authentic mode. And you can also look at this as, uh, you know, a tension between the two polarities. So the idea is when he you're in inauthentic mode, you're, you're conforming to conventional norms. And you might just do it automatically. So, you know, the existentialists are saying, "You're not even really alive. You just, you know, you're just an automaton going through the motions." And then when you're in authentic mode, well then you are exercising the courage and freedom to express your true inner self, even if others disapprove or disagree. You know, you're really having an authentic encounter with other people and being truly alive. 

00:18:50
INTERVIEWER Yeah, I hear what you're saying, and the thing that comes up for me is that sounds difficult to, to be in that authentic mode, especially for new counselors or even graduate students who are trying to develop basic skills. 

00:19:05
DR. MARK SCHOLL Right, it is. And I think what's helpful is, uh, is what I read from Kirk Schneider is just the thought that it's not really all or none. You know, it's not like flipping a switch, you know, and you're authentic. And you flip it this way and your inauthentic. It's, it's more like a continuum, and it's where you fall along that continuum. And the idea of progress would be, uh, becoming relatively more authentic more of the time. So, I think that makes it less daunting if you can visualize it that way. 

00:19:45
INTERVIEWER Do you feel like also helping to sort of be present allows for that authenticity to come out in terms of just focusing on the relationship, what's going now, being genuine. 

00:20:00
DR. MARK SCHOLL Right, the whole concept of being, being open, you know, in the moment to internal experience and not censoring. And you can see where, uh, that whole notion of the counselor providing unconditional positive regard, so key in that respect. Because when you're with somebody that you feel is, is judging you and giving you conditional respect, you feel the need to censor be more guarded. But you can see, you can see the influence of Kierkegaard on Rogers in that respect. 

00:20:40
INTERVIEWER Yeah. What would you say with respect to the client counselor relationship, sort of how existential humanistic counselors and psychologists sort of view the therapeutic relationship between client and counselor? 

00:20:55
DR. MARK SCHOLL What that makes me think of is, uh , is Martin Buber, "I and Thou" and the idea that the ideal being that two people in the relationship, the counselor and the client, are both being authentic together . Uh, and that is really what defines true meeting. For example, if I'm behaving in a way that I think you'd like for me to behave, uh, we are not meeting at all, are we, because I'm just trying to, uh, to meet your expectations or vice versa. But when you're being yourself and I'm being myself, there is a, there's an actual surface contact. And that meeting. And that's the place where healing takes place. 

00:21:45
INTERVIEWER Yeah, yeah. How do you, I hear what you're saying and, and my question is how do you articulate that to clients, especially clients who are either mandated or just don't want to be there? Uh, and, and, and they have their walls. And it sounds like from this particular perspective, authenticity and being in the moment is so crucial to therapeutic movement. 

00:22:10
DR. MARK SCHOLL Yeah, I can see where that would be extremely challenging. And I can just sort of go back to, uh, the facilitative conditions, Rogers core condition, and providing that unconditional positive regard. Uh, and I also think of the recent advent of motivational interviewing and the idea that there are stages of change were some people are, are pre-contemplative and some people are contemplative and some people are planful. And I think to a certain extent the counselor has to have some, uh, understanding and empathy for where that client is. And that would be very very helpful. But what you're saying is very challenging. 

00:23:00
INTERVIEWER Yeah. And it sounds like what you're saying is, is really therapists who operate from this particular framework ultimately need to meet clients where they're at. If they're ready for change, operate from that level or stage if you well. If they're not ready, versus, rather than sort of push them, sort of meet them where they're at, and, and, and go with the resistance in a way. 

00:23:30
DR. MARK SCHOLL And the idea of, uh, the skill, the micro skill of immediacy. You know, the idea that you can reflect the process as part of the process. You can make, you can make comments about what you think might be going on with the client. It might even include, maybe the client is, uh, is not feeling like cooperating or engaging might be a better way of looking at it, because of past experiences with the legal system or authority figures. And through immediacy you can reflect that that's kind of influencing where they are with you right now. 

00:24:15
INTERVIEWER I can see how that can help counselors not personalize things. 

00:24:20
DR. MARK SCHOLL Exactly. 

00:24:20
INTERVIEWER It's not them. It's the client's history with, with the legal system for example. 

00:24:25
DR. MARK SCHOLL Exactly. That's a great point. And that's something we do in role-plays in class, and it's, it's very helpful to do role-plays because through the role-plays the students become less and less defensive as they see it modeled by, by myself and classmates. 

00:24:45
INTERVIEWER How does the existential humanistic counseling perspective view client problems? How do they conceptualize client problems? For example, cognitive behaviorists will say that's due to irrational thinking or something related to cognition or behavior. That's why the client is stuck. 

00:25:05
DR. MARK SCHOLL Well, it's interesting because, uh, you know, it can be very very different from other perspectives in that if your quote normal, that can be a bad sign. Because that means you're fitting in. And what the existentialists say was you don't want to fit in because you're being inauthentic when you're fitting in. 

00:25:25
INTERVIEWER Yeah. You're not being your true self. 

00:25:30
DR. MARK SCHOLL That's right. So the problem could be, it could be disguised in people who are fitting in very well. But inside, what, what's going on inside is what's really key. 

00:25:40
INTERVIEWER Yeah, because that's needed to belong and that need to fit in, especially when you think about youth today and, and, and the cliques that are in schools and just wanting to fit in, whether that's wearing the appropriate attire and things of that nature. How do you help youth understand that being authentic and unique and genuine and true to yourself is, is really important in terms of being able to develop a sense of, a healthy sense of self? Could that, there's a lot of pressure out there. 

00:26:10
DR. MARK SCHOLL I think it's easier when you work with the person if you have the opportunity to work with the person one-on-one, explore their values. Do values clarification and so forth so that they can understand themselves when they are alone. Uh, that could be very helpful. And, and I think that is necessary, uh, for respect for diversity, diverse personalities, diverse values, uh. And if you have that, you can also explore how fitting in with this group one it might not be the right group. You might be trying to fit in with the wrong clique. Of course, ideally you're not trying to fit in with the clinic, because that's so stereotyped. Uh, but the idea is to try to figure out who you really are and to frame it as a problem of constriction, as opposed to expansion. So, you are this person, and you're being constricted so that you'll fit in with this clique. If we could take you outside of that context or you could develop the courage and act, you can expand and be your true self. 

00:27:25
INTERVIEWER And, and become self-actualized in a way. 

00:27:25
DR. MARK SCHOLL Yeah, absolutely. 

00:27:30
INTERVIEWER It sounds like it's, it's really a process, uh, and, and it can take time... 

00:27:35
DR. MARK SCHOLL Absolutely. 

00:27:35
INTERVIEWER ...with, with clients. How does the existential humanistic perspective sort of take that into consideration when you think about managed-care industries and, and, and how therapy has become really in a package or or limited in the sense? 

00:27:50
DR. MARK SCHOLL That's a real serious concern because of the, of the medical model. This is, this is not going to be, uh, the first choice in terms of cost effectiveness or efficiency, uh, or third party payments and so forth. But I think one bright side is that this is such a broad perspective that you can use a lot of different techniques in the name of existentialism. For example, if you were trying to help somebody expand where you could use systematic desensitization. You know, but in, in your mind you are conceptualizing it from an existential framework. But in terms of justifying it to the, to the providers, you know, the insurance company, well you are using systematic desensitization. So you can, you can pay for. You can justify it. 

00:28:45
INTERVIEWER Okay, okay. So it has a pragmatic sense to it. 

00:28:50
DR. MARK SCHOLL It does. It does. You just have to be able to, and I think that that's kind of a, of a misunderstanding is that existential humanistics are very eclectic. And they will, they will borrow from here and there to meet the client's needs. You know, with them, because it is such, such an all encompassing framework. Yeah. 

00:29:15
INTERVIEWER Yeah. In one sense, it's, it's, I think one of the of the advantages to being able to borrow and be eclectic if you will is, is you can sort of have different perspectives and tools, uh, to sort of work with clients. I wonder if you see as one of the disadvantages of being eclectic is, is you can have too many. Does that make sense? Where it's hard to be really in depth? 

00:29:45
DR. MARK SCHOLL I don't, I don't see it that way. You know, I just, I see it as a serious challenge. Cuz I gave that example of systematic desensitization, but you, I would say the majority of the concerns of clients, uh, are existential, and they are not easily defined from a behavioral perspective. And that's a real problem with our, you know, with our profession. One answer to that is that our profession is coming more and more to embrace experiential forms of counseling, and that is very compatible with existential humanism. 

00:30:30
INTERVIEWER How do you quantify that in, in, in the world we live in now where accountability is so important? 

00:30:40
DR. MARK SCHOLL I, I think that is, I don't really have an answer for that. That is a, a legitimate question and problem for this perspective. Yeah. 

00:30:50
INTERVIEWER Okay. 

00:30:50
DR. MARK SCHOLL Yeah, with the medical model, you're definitely at a disadvantage. 

00:30:55
INTERVIEWER Yeah. In terms of the role of the therapist or the counselor or psychologist, how does the existential humanistic perspective view the therapist role? 

00:31:05
DR. MARK SCHOLL It's, it's not that different from what you would see with Carl Rogers' working. I, I mentioned earlier the idea of, uh, you know, the wounded healer. That's an example. Another term that's used is, uh, the wise teacher, uh, or guide. But humble. The person is humble because how can you purport to be an expert on life experience? You know, it's, it's the idea that you're a respectful guide, and, and you're encouraging people and supporting them in making courageous choices. So, it's not, it's really not that different from what you would see with Carl Rogers. 

00:31:55
INTERVIEWER So, you use the terms wounded healer, guide, uh, and so it sounds like what you're saying is a therapist who operates from this paradigm is really a facilitator of, of the process versus always the expert that, that leads all the time or, or view themselves as, as all knowing if you will. 

00:32:20
DR. MARK SCHOLL Right. And the idea is that each one of us has within the the strength, uh, to be self-healing as, as the, uh, term wounded healer indicates, the person who was wounded somehow found a way to heal and so can the client. And you're, you're, as the counselor you're the catalyst for that process. 

00:32:45
INTERVIEWER And so you're sort of the tool that sort of helps that change come to place or to fruition if you will. 

00:32:55
DR. MARK SCHOLL Yeah. You provide, uh, the relationship and companionship in a sense, so the person isn't all alone and struggling with their, with their concerns. 

00:33:05
INTERVIEWER What do you see as some of the strengths of this particular approach to therapy? 

00:33:15
DR. MARK SCHOLL Well, for me personally, uh, I like the idea of these dialectical tensions. I have studied a lot of philosophy along with psychology, and I, and I see inherent truths in this perspective. I like the idea of emphasizing, uh, that people have the freedom. I see it as very empowering. That's definitely a strength. I like the emphasis on responsibility. So, uh, it's, it's difficult though because for some people they would like a more circumscribed concrete approach to working on the problem. 

00:34:00
INTERVIEWER Dr. Scholl, you've spoken about some of the strengths of the existential humanistic perspective in counseling or psychology. I'm wondering if you can talk about what you view as its limitations or what others may view as the limitations of this particular perspective. 

00:34:15
DR. MARK SCHOLL I mentioned before, it's the idea that everybody doesn't embrace this sort of expensive philosophical attitude. Some people want to be very pragmatic and concrete and just focus on how do I fix this problem and would really welcome a behavioral approach. And that's coming from the client's preferences. So I think sometimes you really have to think. It's imperative, and it's also one of the fundamental tenants of humanism is individualism. So you really have to think about is this really a good match for this particular client? It may be quite a poor match for some clients who are more inclined to think in terms of a reductionistic approach. 

00:35:10
INTERVIEWER So, it's not necessarily an approach that would work with all clients, in all situations. 

00:35:15
DR. MARK SCHOLL Absolutely not, yeah. 

00:35:15
INTERVIEWER Sounds like what you're saying. 

00:35:15
DR. MARK SCHOLL No, I think, I think with all these approaches, you know, that you use, you really have to think about the match and the fit with the client that you're working with. But I do think that, you know, introspection is, is important. And self-awareness, increased self-awareness has key fundamental principles is something that all clients can benefit from. 

00:35:45
INTERVIEWER Yeah. And it sounded like having a dialogue with clients in terms of is this going to be a bit, as is going to be match? This journey we're about to embark is really critical, would you say? 

00:35:55
DR. MARK SCHOLL Having that discussion and, and, and I think of it in terms of structuring, where you talk with the client about the process of counseling. But, the importance of checking with the client and, and seeing what did they think counseling is like and what their expectations are too, because this really isn't a time efficient process often. You know, it's something that can be long term. 

00:36:25
INTERVIEWER Yeah. Making sure clients are committed and are going to make it a priority it sounds like is really important to really be able to benefit from this particular paradigm in, in counseling it sounds. 

00:36:35
DR. MARK SCHOLL Yeah, absolutely. I talked earlier about the constructivist resume. And I want to talk a little bit about the, the idea of multiculturalism. You know, so for example, with the, with the constructivist resume you have the card sort, and some of those cards are values. And you have to think, where did those values come from? And when I look at those values, I have to say they come from kind of a Western perspective. And they come from, uh, American products such as Super's Value Scale. And so, they might not be multiculturally responsive to the extent that they could be. Improvements could be made. But at the same time, you'd have to, you have to think in terms of, I mean, going right back to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. If, if the client is dealing with, uh, basic physiological needs, and you're counseling them, you have to be considerate og that and accommodate that need. It's not the time for, uh, dealing with existential themes in their life necessarily. It's more about food, clothing, shelter. And they don't need the ideal job. They need a source of income. Yeah. 

00:38:00
INTERVIEWER Yeah. It's really about being able to meet clients were they're out, kind of what you talked about earlier. Being able to accurately assess clients in terms of where they're at and what their needs are. You know, one of the things you talked about was sort of multiculturalism and, and as you look at the field of counseling and psychology, the clients we're serving are a lot more diverse than they were before. How does the existential humanistic perspective respond to the changing demographics if you will of our clientele? 

00:38:30
DR. MARK SCHOLL That's a very good question. I, I think that is a question that is neglected. But, but I will say the, that existentialism is enhanced by the fact that we are a more globalized society because through the media, you know, through the Internet, uh, people see that there's, there's no one truth. There is no one reality. That there are different cultures with different realities. And so that brings home the point, I can't adopt somebody else's reality when there are so many realities that already exist. Uh, I'm responsible for constructing a meaningful reality for myself. But at the same time, an increased respect for the realities of, of different people. I don't know if that, if that's quite got to your question. 

00:39:30
INTERVIEWER It does in the sense of it sounds like what you're saying is, is this particular mode of operation if you will really respect people in terms of their world views, and the that there are multiple truths, not necessarily one truth. 

00:39:45
DR. MARK SCHOLL Absolutely. So that's a real sense in which it's compatible with multiculturalism. Yeah, absolutely. 

00:39:55
INTERVIEWER Okay. Dr. Scholl, you've talked a lot about where the field has been and where it's at in terms of its current state. Where do you see it going, the existential humanistic perspective in counseling and psychology? 

00:40:05
DR. MARK SCHOLL I think that there is a proliferation of techniques that are facilitating this process of constructing your future identity. And, and the very concept. Peavey's socio-dynamic theory comes to mind, the idea that by the choices we make and the actions that we perform, we are constructing our identities, our very identities. And we can be even more intentional about that and even more forward thinking. And I think we'll see more and more techniques along those lines. 

00:40:45
INTERVIEWER Okay. 

00:40:50
DR. MARK SCHOLL Another thing is, uh, therapies are becoming more and more individualized. So they're becoming, I think I see it is kind of a, a backlash against these, uh, behavioral protocols. For example, how you would deal with cigarette smoking. Uh, there is an increasing number of approaches that emphasize using the individuals growth edges, this concept of growth edges to construct a very unique approach to working with them and facilitating what they've defined as meaningful growth edges. 

00:41:30
INTERVIEWER And for those viewers who are wanting to learn more about the existential humanistic perspective in counseling and psychology, what recommendations would you have for them in terms of how they might themselves become more immersed in this movement? 

00:41:50
DR. MARK SCHOLL Well, there is, there is a couple of texts. There's Corsini's "Current Psychotherapy" and "Current Psychotherapies". And then there's, uh, "Essential Psychotherapies" and Kirk Schneider has chapters in both of those books that are very very good. Uh, and going, going back and reading some of the original writings of Heidegger and Kierkegaard, uh, Victor Frankel's "Man's Search for Meaning". Uh, there is, there's so many rich sources in philosophy. Yeah. It's hard to single out some as the ones that you, you must read. But, yeah. 

00:42:35
INTERVIEWER Yeah. But, some good recommendations. And it sounds like what you're really saying is for folks to really be grounded in those particular perspectives, they really need to read the classics, the original works. Uh, understand how it evolved, to, to understand how this particular perspective evolved to its present state. 

00:42:55
DR. MARK SCHOLL Them that, and that again goes along with, uh, if you're really interested in this perspective or this approach to counseling, it probably says something about, about your personality and your preferences or reading classics and reading philosophy. 

00:43:15
INTERVIEWER It takes a certain type of person in the sense. 

00:43:15
DR. MARK SCHOLL Yeah. And Carl Rogers is very philosophical. Books by, books by Carl, Carl Rogers are very good to read as well. 

00:43:25
INTERVIEWER I just want to thank you for your time. I know I learned a lot about existentialism and humanistic counseling and psychology and how this third wave in the field has really come to fruition and has influenced the counseling profession. I just want to thank you for giving your time to us, to me, in terms of just being able to articulate what your perspective is in this particular movement in the field. 

00:43:50
DR. MARK SCHOLL Thanks a lot. I enjoyed it. 

00:43:55
INTERVIEWER Thank you.
