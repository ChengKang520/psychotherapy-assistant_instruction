Part 1: The Initial Assessment 

00:00:00
THERAPIST So, here we are Mary Jane. It's good to see you. Um I'm gonna get you to tell me what's brought you here shortly, but before you do, I'd like to just tell you a little bit about the process. Have you seen a counselor before? 

00:00:40
MARY JANE No. 

00:00:40
THERAPIST Oh, you haven't. Okay. Um, what I'll do is get you to tell me, um, what's brought you here. Then, um, we'll look together at what are the, the most troubling aspects of what, what's brought you here. And then we'll work out a plan together that,that sounds like it might help. Okay? 

00:01:00
MARY JANE (crosstalk) Okay. Sounds good. 

00:01:00
THERAPIST Good. Okay, but before we do that, um, I wanna just tell you a little bit about confidentiality here. Because people sometimes worry about, what, where this information might go. Um, what you tell me here is absolutely confidential. So if we happen to involve anyone else at some stage, partner, parents, I don't know who's in the picture, um, I wouldn't be divulging what goes on here. Yeah? 

00:01:30
MARY JANE That's good. 

00:01:30
THERAPIST ...without your permission. Yeah? 

00:01:30
MARY JANE Yep. 

00:01:30
THERAPIST Um, there are a couple of sticky areas and that is, if, if I felt you were at risk or anyone else was, was really at risk, then I might have to, to talk to you about talking to somebody else. 

00:01:45
MARY JANE Okay. 

00:01:45
THERAPIST But that's (inaudible ). 

00:01:50
MARY JANE Yeah, I don't, I don't, Okay. 

00:01:50
THERAPIST Also, if you were, um, if you happened to be involved in anything that was pretty shady in terms of the law, you might think about what you told me today. 

00:02:00
MARY JANE What about like growing dope? 

00:02:05
THERAPIST That's, that, I wouldn't call that serious. 

00:02:05
MARY JANE Okay. 

00:02:05
THERAPIST Yeah? 

00:02:05
MARY JANE Okay. 

00:02:05
THERAPIST But we'll talk about that as we go along. Um, so does that, does that feel okay about in terms of what goes on between us? 

00:02:15
MARY JANE Yeah, that sound, that sounds fine. 

00:02:20
THERAPIST Good. Okay. So how bout you tell me then what, what's brought you here. Where, where, where would you like to start? 

00:02:25
MARY JANE Okay. Um, well I'm here because of my cannabis, my, you know, I smoke a lot of dope. 

00:02:30
THERAPIST Right. 

00:02:30
MARY JANE Um, I've been smoking dope for a long time. 

00:02:35
THERAPIST Right. 

00:02:35
MARY JANE I'm 28 now. 

00:02:35
THERAPIST Right. 

00:02:40
MARY JANE And I guess I've been smoking fairly heavily for about 10 years. 

00:02:45
THERAPIST Is it okay if I just take a few notes? 

00:02:45
MARY JANE Yeah sure. 

00:02:45
THERAPIST So that I can keep track of things? 

00:02:45
MARY JANE Yeah that's fine. Been smoking, I mean I started smoking when I was at school. 

00:02:50
THERAPIST Yep. 

00:02:50
MARY JANE And it was just like the usual kind of kid stuff. You know, we'd smoke on the weekends and get drunk. You know anything that came my way, I'd try you know. I was one of those sort of kids. 

00:03:00
THERAPIST (crosstalk)Right. Mm-hmm 

00:03:00
MARY JANE Um, but then, when I started University, when I, when I was 18, I guess it got really, it got more to be, I've looked back, you know, at this now like in retrospect, at the time I didn't even think about it, but I guess it got to be more of a habit. Because I was studying really hard, I was pretty stressed and I found that it helped me to relax and helped me to sleep at night. And basically, I've been really using it like that ever since. Um, I guess like I'm a pretty anxious person anyway, And it's always kind of chilled me out. 

00:03:40
THERAPIST (crosstalk) Right. Okay. Right. Yes. 

00:03:40
MARY JANE Um and its always worked quite well for me until quite recently, because what's happened recently is, well it's actually, it's, it's about, I don't know, three months ago now, I, it used to always really chill me out, like I'd smoke a joint, a cone, as much as I smoked, it would just relax me and I'd laugh and I'd have a good time, but about three months ago, I noticed when I, when I smoked, I got really paranoid. And I actually, like I felt like I was gonna have a heart attack. My heart was beating really, really fast. Then someone told me that that was a panic attack when I explained it to somebody and since that time, it's like I can't really smoke a lot of dope without having that. 

00:04:25
THERAPIST Right. So there's been quite a shift in how, how you've experienced it. 

00:04:30
MARY JANE Yeah, yeah. 

00:04:30
THERAPIST And that's been pretty uncomfortable. 

00:04:30
MARY JANE Yeah, really uncomfortable. Because now it's got to the point where if I do smoke, I feel uncomfortable, if I don't smoke I feel uncomfortable. 

00:04:40
THERAPIST So you're damned if you do, damned if you don't. 

00:04:40
MARY JANE Exactly. 

00:04:40
THERAPIST Right. 

00:04:40
MARY JANE And I guess that's why I came here. There's, there's other stuff as well like even before I had this panic attack. I've been thinking you know possibly that this isn't what I want to do with my life. Like I've just noticed that I'm... I mean I've got a pretty responsible job. I work as a computer programmer. 

00:05:00
THERAPIST (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Right. 

00:05:00
MARY JANE And like I need to think a lot at work like I need to use my brain a lot and I've noticed that I've been finding it really hard to concentrate and my boyfriend says that he thinks that it's the dope. 

00:05:15
THERAPIST (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Right. Okay, so you have a boyfriend? 

00:05:15
MARY JANE Yeah. Yeah. We've been together about five years. 

00:05:20
THERAPIST Okay. What? What's his name? 

00:05:25
MARY JANE David. 

00:05:25
THERAPIST So he, he's actually said to you he thinks it's to do with..? 

00:05:30
MARY JANE Yeah. 

00:05:30
THERAPIST Right. 

00:05:30
MARY JANE Yeah, I mean I, and then when I think, when I mean I think that I, I argued with him when he first said that, but I think, if I think about it, it is. 

00:05:40
THERAPIST Yeah. Well you've given me a lot of really good, a good kind of birds-eye view. What I'd like to do now is go back and pick some of the story a little bit and just get an idea of when the shifts occurred in, in your pattern of use. Is that, that's okay? 

00:05:55
MARY JANE Yeah. 

00:05:55
THERAPIST Good. So you said you, when you were a teenager, it was just kind of pretty normal kind of use, yeah? 

00:06:00
MARY JANE Yeah, I think so 

00:06:00
THERAPIST Yeah. And then when you went to Uni? It started to, that's when you first noticed a shift? 

00:06:10
MARY JANE Yeah. I mean and like I said at the time, I didn't really notice it, but it's only kinda now when I start to question my use, that I look back and I notice that, I notice I guess I started smoking more. Cuz when I was at school it was just on the weekends. When I uhm, when I started University, it was more like every night. You know, I started smoking every night and weekends as well. 

00:06:35
THERAPIST Do you, do you smoke joints or use a bong or what? 

00:06:40
MARY JANE Uhm, Gen, generally, if I'm at home I'll use a bong.But if I'm out I'll use joints. And sometimes it varies you know? Like I'll smoke joints at home sometimes depending on what I'm doing like if I'm cooking or something I'll smoke a joint. 

00:06:50
THERAPIST (crosstalk) Right. Okay. Yes. Right. 

00:06:50
MARY JANE Yeah. 

00:06:50
THERAPIST OK. But at Uni, uhm you noticed that the use crept up and you were smoking most nights. 

00:06:55
MARY JANE Mm-hmm. 

00:06:55
THERAPIST Um to, to go to sleep or to or was it before you studied or, or what? 

00:07:05
MARY JANE Um, both really. I guess like I'd have, I'd I guess I'm in this, and I'm still in this habit now like when I get home I'll have a joint. It's like the way for me to unwind. So I go home and have a joint and then you know as the night progresses I'll have a couple more or have a couple more cones or whatever. And then at you know before I go to bed, I'll have a big smoke because it helps me go to sleep. 

00:07:30
THERAPIST (crosstalk) Yes. Right. Right. OK. And was that alone? You were smoking alone? 

00:07:35
MARY JANE No, I had a flat mate then who I used to smoke with. I wasn't with my boyfriend then, but it was with a flat mate. 

00:07:40
THERAPIST (crosstalk) Right. Okay. 

00:07:40
MARY JANE Yeah, but I guess even if she wasn't there, I'd still do it. 

00:07:45
THERAPIST Right. Okay. 

00:07:45
MARY JANE Yeah. 

00:07:45
THERAPIST So it really has served quite a, a purpose for you in terms of relaxing you and chilling you out. That's been, that's been quite a long sort of pattern. 

00:07:55
MARY JANE Yeah. 

00:07:55
THERAPIST Okay. Um, but you were able to, obviously you were able to accomplish what you did at Uni. You, you finished your course? 

00:08:05
MARY JANE Yeah. 

00:08:05
THERAPIST And, moved in, into the job that you've got now. 

00:08:05
MARY JANE Yeah. 

00:08:05
THERAPIST and into the area. 

00:08:10
MARY JANE Yeah. 

00:08:10
THERAPIST So when was the next shift you noticed? 

00:08:15
MARY JANE Well, I guess like my boyfriend, when I got with my boyfriend, which is now about I think its five years ago, he's also a very heavy smoker and all of his friends smoke as well. And I think that then I opted, you know I opted it more because it was you know, he and I were kind of you know more so than my flat mate. It became a part of our relationship. 

00:08:40
THERAPIST It's easy for that to happen isn't it? When you're kind of just creating a life together and you both tend to do the same things. 

00:08:45
MARY JANE (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. 

00:08:45
THERAPIST I think it was probably understandable that that happened. 

00:08:50
MARY JANE Yeah. And I've also noticed that I find like that he, he's not really much of a talker and so when if he's not, if he's not stoned, he won't, he doesn't talk to me. So the only time that we actually talk about relationship stuff is when we're stoned. 

00:09:05
THERAPIST So when he's loosened up a bit. He's more able to be the kind of man you want him to be. 

00:09:10
MARY JANE (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. And I guess like both of us become like you know, I, he obviously trusts me more as well and you know we can talk together more. 

00:09:15
THERAPIST (crosstalk) Right. Right. So what, what's been your pattern of use when you work? 

00:09:25
MARY JANE Well its, it's actually it's not all that different to when I was at Uni but I guess now, I mean there's a few things that have changed like not only have I got more money but we also grow our own, so there's an unlimited supply in a way. Um, so it's just really gotten more I guess, one of the main differences is that now I'll smoke kind of all weekend. You know, like I'll spend most of the weekend stoned. Whereas before I would not and I think that I, I just smoke more. Um, I still smoke every night, but it's more. I mean I smoke depending on what's going on, I can smoke up to, you know, up to six cones a night. 

00:10:05
THERAPIST (crosstalk)Right. Okay. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Mm-hmm. Right. During, during the week? 

00:10:10
MARY JANE Yeah, that's probably a bit high. It's like usually more like four or five I guess. 

00:10:15
THERAPIST Okay. Yeah. 

00:10:15
MARY JANE Yeah. 

00:10:15
THERAPIST So it does sound like you're um, use has crept up over time hasn't it? And that, and that, one of the things is that you kinda end up chasing your own tail because the more you smoke the more tolerant you become to it, and you need a little bit more to get the same kick out of it. 

00:10:35
MARY JANE Right. Yeah. 

00:10:35
THERAPIST Um so maybe four or five cones during, during the week every night and how, how does that fit with your work? How are you able to, to work? 

00:10:45
MARY JANE Ah well that's sorta something that you know how I was saying about my concentration and stuff I, like I notice, I guess I've noticed, but also my boss has mentioned to me that I mean because I, I've been, my punctuality isn't very good. I find it very hard to get up in the morning. And, um, especially since, well it's, I don't know what ha-, came first, the panic attack or this other stuff, you know, that's gone on, but my boss actually, you know, called me into his office and said you know you're work's slipping. Y-, you're late a lot, and he's actually like you know, I've worked in this job for like four years. He's a really like a good boss a really like a friend as well and for him to have said that, that really really upset me. Um, I know that like I, and that really worried me and what's happened since I've had, since I found myself getting very anxious when I smoke dope. I've been drinking, as well, alcohol. And I've always drank a bit, but now I find that I'm drinking more because I have these panic attacks if I smoke too much dope, so I'm just smoking a little bit of dope, having drinks, and then having really bad hangovers in the morning. So, I guess yeah work's become difficult for me, where before.. 

00:12:05
THERAPIST (crosstalk)Right. Okay. Right. Hmm. Right. Okay. Right. Hmm.. You're trying to be creative and manage that yourself if you recognize that maybe your cannabis use is a bit high and causing and contributing to this which we can kind of tease out a bit more. But, uhm, it sounds like you've been trying to tackle it in your own way, but, but the methods you've been using haven't been working very well. They've actually had another round of problems with them. 

00:12:30

00:12:30
Part II: Motivational Interviewing iIf nothing changes I can't see a way out.." 

00:12:35
THERAPIST Hi again. 

00:12:35
MARY JANE Hi. 

00:12:35
THERAPIST How's your week been? 

00:12:35
MARY JANE Ah yea, It's been okay. 

00:12:35
THERAPIST Mm-hmm. 

00:12:35
MARY JANE Not much changed. 

00:12:40
THERAPIST Oh well, we didn't expect much change, you know. We said let's not try and do anything dramatic yet until we.. you, you feel ready and you've got a plan that feels clear. 

00:12:45
MARY JANE Mm-hmm. 

00:12:45
THERAPIST Um, so you gave me a lot of good information last time about some of the ,the kind of history of your use, you know, how it's changed over time, and it's got to a point where you're really quite concerned. What I'd like to do now is get, um, really clear between us you know, the things that you really want to address. But, you, you said you've had a relationship with this drug for a long time, yeah? So it's had a place in your life. I'd like to find out a bit more about what's attracted you to this, to this drug. What are some of the good things about using this drug? 

00:13:25
MARY JANE Well, I mean the main thing is, well was, you know it's not really such a, such an issue anymore but the main thing was the relaxation. 

00:13:35
THERAPIST Yes, yes. 

00:13:35
MARY JANE Uhmm, I think even as a child, I was quite anxious so you know, I found I always looked at other people and thought, how can they be so relaxed in social situations? And it's almost like smoking dope made me a normal person because I could relax and talk to people. 

00:13:55
THERAPIST (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. OK. 

00:13:55
MARY JANE I think that I'm pretty.. 

00:13:55
THERAPIST That's a, that's a pretty powerful reason to, to, to use it if it had that effect on you cuz it's not pleasant to walk around the world feeling pretty strung out and tense. 

00:14:05
MARY JANE (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. Mm-mm. Like I would never go up to someone at a party and talk to them, you know. And I didn't really, alcohol although lots of other people drank, that wasn't really, didn't do that much for me. Like I really love the way like dope didn't really change who I was, but it just made me more relaxed. 

00:14:25
THERAPIST Right. So it felt like you could kind of be more of yourself, the way you'd like to be. 

00:14:30
MARY JANE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:14:30
THERAPIST So that's how it was. 

00:14:30
MARY JANE Yeah. 

00:14:30
THERAPIST Okay. Well, what other things about using cannabis have been good or helpful or, or.. 

00:14:40
MARY JANE I think that like, this might sound really, you know, sort of way out and weird, but I like the way it kind of makes you think about things differently, and the way it makes you laugh, you know, like you see humor in the most stupid things, and I really like that. 

00:14:55
THERAPIST (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Right. Yeah. Yeah, well that's something I think a lot of people say. That it kind of gets them thinking about a whole bunch of stuff that's left field stuff, and uhm their minds just can, can tag along. Yeah, yeah. OK. Um.. 

00:15:10
MARY JANE It, it actually used to help me think, you know. Like I would, I would, like when I was at Uni when I would sit down to a study, it would actually help me to focus on what I was studying. Like sometimes I'd feel quite distracted. If I had a joint it would help me to kind of focus. Which now, I mean now, it has the opposite effect. 

00:15:30
THERAPIST (crosstalk)Right. Right. Okay. Hmm. Okay. You also mentioned that you moved with, with a lot people, who, who, for whom it's part of life. So I guess that's another good thing about it. 

00:15:40
MARY JANE (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. Hmm Yeah, it is. Um, like, my, my boyfriend's friends all smoke, and my boyfriend smokes dope. But you know my friends at work don't and that's also, I guess I'm starting to look at some of those people and go well, if they can live without it, why can't I? 

00:16:00
THERAPIST (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Right. So that has kinda of two edges to that. On the one hand, you..you kinda belong to this group with your boyfriend and the friends there, but on the other hand, um, you're getting a glimpse of the fact that you don't actually need it to kind of connect with people and enjoy people in another context. 

00:16:15
MARY JANE Yeah. That's right. 

00:16:15
THERAPIST Um, I want to make sure we've got an exhaustive list of the things that are attractive about it, because.. because it's, it's some of those things are the things that are gonna perhaps interfere or kind of make it a bit harder to change your pattern , so it's good for us to get clear about that. 

00:16:30
MARY JANE Well, I think that one of the main ones is the communication with David. 

00:16:35
THERAPIST Right. Okay. Yeah. 

00:16:35
MARY JANE Um, and I, I think that because we've been together since, you know like since I was 23, like I was actually pretty young when we got together and I knew him before we started , you know, as a couple as well. Um, I think that I never really realized that that was the situation in our relationship. It's not until now where I've started to question I'd like to maybe give up and that I've actually thought well how can I talk to him, like we don't even talk, we hardly even talk to each other when we're straight. 

00:17:05
THERAPIST Right, so that's a bit of an Therapist, isn't it? 

00:17:05
MARY JANE Yeah. and I really am committed to the relationship. 

00:17:10
THERAPIST Mm-hmm. 

00:17:10
MARY JANE I don't want to lose the relationship. 

00:17:10
THERAPIST Right. Okay. 

00:17:15
MARY JANE That's a bit of a fear I have. 

00:17:15
THERAPIST Yes. Okay. Well that's a pretty powerful set of attractions that it chills you out and relaxes you; that your mind kind of expands, you can think about things creatively. Uhm and I'm aware that you're saying that some of these things have faded a bit recently, but you know we'll still (inaudible ) being powerful draw cards. Uhm.. that it gets you laughing, and particularly, that it helps with the communi-, the more intimate kind of communication with David and that you're a bit fearful that without that you're not quite sure how you'd relate to him on that level. 

00:17:50
MARY JANE Yeah. 

00:17:55
THERAPIST OK. So now let's, let's shift the focus over to the other side and have, see if we can get really clear together about what are the not so good things, and one of them obviously is, you know, I don't know how it's going to be with David without it. 

00:18:05
MARY JANE Mm. Yeah, yeah, I don't know if I can talk to him or whether he'll talk to me. 

00:18:15
THERAPIST Yes. But, what are the, what are some of the things that are really, are really worrying you about your use? 

00:18:20
MARY JANE Well I guess um, I say that it relaxes me but it really doesn't anymore. Really. I mean I could have a little smoke, and it'll have a little effect on me, but then if I smoke a lot, I actually get a lot more anxious, and you know. Well I don't get panic attacks all the time, but if I smoke a lot, I'll have a panic attack. I'll get really paranoid, I, you know I can't even talk to, you know actually I can't even talk to David, come to think of it. I haven't told him about the panic attacks. 

00:18:50
THERAPIST Oh God. So you've been battling this alone. 

00:18:55
MARY JANE Yeah because he, I don't think he'd understand. I mean he's been on my case about the work th-, well not on my case but he, like my, when my boss pulled me to line, and you know he's like, it's the dope you know. You should cut down and I just don't, I don't know why I haven't told him, but.. 

00:19:15
THERAPIST Right. So it's not relaxing you now and in fact it seems to be contributing to, to quite an escalation in your anxiety. You're having panic attacks or, or panic episodes. Um, that you've become quite paranoid and worried about what other people are thinking or noticing. 

00:19:35
MARY JANE (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. Mm, yeah. 

00:19:35
THERAPIST And there is the work stuff that you mentioned last time that you're kind of rolling up a bit late, and you're not feeling that you're performing as sharply at work. Yep. So there's, there's um punctuality, there's performance at work. 

00:19:50
MARY JANE And I, I just I, I couldn't, I coul-, I just can't imagine if I lost my job. Like I'd just be devastated because we've bought a house, and we're paying off a mortgage, and I mean I'm the main money earner out of the two of us and I just, yeah, I can't imagine what would happen if I lost my job. 

00:20:05
THERAPIST (crosstalk) Right. Okay. Oh. Okay. So there's quite a lot at stake. 

00:20:10
MARY JANE Yeah. 

00:20:10
THERAPIST If, uhm if this problem continues and cannabis is playing a major role in this. Mm. OK. Um, it sounds like you, you are pretty concerned about some of these, these things. If you, if you were to continue kind of managing things the way you are and not change how much you're using or change how you're going about it, what do you think would be happening in a couple years' time? 

00:20:40
MARY JANE I just dread to think really, I mean we've talked about having, having a baby, like having children. And I just can't, I don't wanna be like this and have a baby. I mean I can't have a baby when I'm like this. I mean if I was to, if nothing changes and even though I saw you last week, like this week, I mean I thought about it but I just can't, I can't see a way out and I just don't think that work is.. I was late for work almost, you know like, I was, I think got there on time like one day. I did no work last week cuz I think now that I'm thinking about giving up, I'm quite stressed about that. And I'm just really worried about what I can't, I can't imagine what, you know. I feel like I'm losing myself. 

00:21:35
THERAPIST (crosstalk) Right. Right. Yes. Right. 

00:21:40

00:21:40
Part III: Problem Solving and Goal Setting: Exploring the Small Solutions 

00:21:40
THERAPIST Hi again. 

00:21:40
MARY JANE Hi. 

00:21:50
THERAPIST We had a, we had quite an intense session last time I think, you know we we really, um, picked what, what's troubling you and uh, I guess the next step in the process is to, to decide what it is you want to do about your cannabis use. Clearly you're very troubled about it, and there are a few options. One of which is to cut out cannabis entirely from your life. The other is to cut back in some way cuz I guess an option is not to continue as you are, but.. 

00:22:20
MARY JANE No. I mean I.. 

00:22:20
THERAPIST So what's your feeling? 

00:22:20
MARY JANE Well, you know, I've thought about this, and part of me would just like to, I just wish that I could continue using but it would work the way it used to work. 

00:22:30
THERAPIST Right. Right. 

00:22:30
MARY JANE Which is unrealistic because I know that I don't really wanna keep smoking the way I am. So, so I think that, I don't know whether I wanna like cut do- cut it like completely outta my life. Like I feel like the problems are with my work and um the sense that it's such a habit for me. Like I really wish I could choose to use at parties or on the weekends, but choose to use it? Not have to use it. 

00:23:05
THERAPIST (crosstalk)Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Okay. Part of that will be as we work together, teaching you some ways to manage your anxiety because there are heaps of other things we can do to help you manage your anxiety, which is a kind of constitutional thing, yeah? 

00:23:15
MARY JANE That'll be great. 

00:23:15
THERAPIST Okay. So, you're saying that you'd like to cut back, uhm particularly around your work performance. So does that mean you'd like to cut back your use during the week for now? 

00:23:30
MARY JANE (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah, I think that that would be, that would be great, if I could. 

00:23:35
THERAPIST Right, if you could. 

00:23:35
MARY JANE Yeah. 

00:23:35
THERAPIST Okay. So you feel a bit shaky about that. 

00:23:35
MARY JANE Oh, yeah. 

00:23:40
THERAPIST What, what might be useful for us now is if, if I take you through a process that, that is actually quite a good little general skill to have if you've got problems in your life that you can't immediately see a solution to and that is that we generate a few ideas together about how you might go about cutting back during the week. And what's important in this process is for us just to throw everything up in the air and look at anything possible that is going to help you accomplish that. And look at them, look at everything at the end of that process and see whether there're some things that stand out that might work better than others. So but for the moment really important that we just think of anything that's gonna help you um handle this problem of giving up during the week. 

00:24:20
MARY JANE (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:24:25
THERAPIST Um, then, we'll get you to, to pick maybe one or two strategies that you think will be manageable, and you'll have a shot at those in the next week. Um, bearing in mind that um if they don't work, if it doesn't happen the way we planned it that we go back to the drawing board and have another shot, hmm? It's not, because this is trial and error, yeah? So let's think about what might be some ways you could go back cutting back during the week. What could you do? You said you started, your first smoke during the week is usually when you get home right? Okay. So what, what might we be able to do to cut back? 

00:25:05
MARY JANE What I have been doing is trying to drink more. 

00:25:10
THERAPIST Right. Okay. 

00:25:10
MARY JANE Which isn't very healthy, unhealthy, but.. 

00:25:15
THERAPIST It's, you know, one strategy. Let's not evaluate it at the moment. Let's just write it down and, and see where it takes us. So you could drink alcohol instead, hmm? 

00:25:25
MARY JANE Which is I guess what I've done. Another thing that um, another thing that I um, I, I have done in the past which has kind of you know stopped me, like made me more healthy, but I don't whether I'm even able to do it anymore, is do sport. 

00:25:40
THERAPIST Right. OK. 

00:25:40
MARY JANE Like so, I mean I couldn't do that every night, but I remember I used to play net ball and when I went to net ball after I work, I basically wouldn't smoke on that night. 

00:25:50
THERAPIST Maybe, maybe one or two nights a week doing something structured straight after work. 

00:25:55
MARY JANE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:26:00
THERAPIST : Right. Okay. 

00:26:00
MARY JANE Yeah. That could work. 

00:26:00
THERAPIST Yup. That's another idea. 

00:26:05
MARY JANE Yeah. 

00:26:05
THERAPIST What else do you think? How bout you volunteer to do overtime and stay back until 10:00 every night? Hmm? 

00:26:10
MARY JANE Yeah, I could do that. 

00:26:15
THERAPIST You could do that? Well, let's put it down. 

00:26:15
MARY JANE I'd probably just like come home at 10:00 at night you know, smoke, smoke a bucket or something. 

00:26:20
THERAPIST Oh, Okay. Well, let's, let's you know (inaudible ) whether it's gonna be a good one or a bad one at the moment. So you could stay at work a bit later and that might get you to cut a couple of joints out. 

00:26:30
MARY JANE Yeah 

00:26:30
THERAPIST : Yeah? 

00:26:30
MARY JANE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:26:35
THERAPIST Okay. What else could you do? 

00:26:35
MARY JANE I could, I could like go and stay with my sister who doesn't smoke. 

00:26:40
THERAPIST (crosstalk)Okay. Right. 

00:26:40
MARY JANE Because I just think that with David, like David smokes after work and it's not really a problem for him, and so it's very hard for me in that house to go home and not smoke. 

00:26:55
THERAPIST :(crosstalk) Right. Right. Okay. So you're looking at a way that you might be able to be with somebody, but not, not smoke? 

00:27:00
MARY JANE Yeah. 

00:27:00
THERAPIST : So you might stay with your si-, so you might move in with your sister for a few days or? 

00:27:05
MARY JANE (crosstalk)I don't wanna.. Yeah. Just temporarily. Yeah. 

00:27:10
THERAPIST Okay. I guess one possibility is that you could, you could visit her, you know, you could actually. Maybe we could put that down as another one that you could visit her one night a week or maybe visit someone else so that again you, you're catching up with people you want to catch up with. So you could visit your sister or friend for one night. 

00:27:30
MARY JANE (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah I could, I could arrange with friends from work to do things. 

00:27:35
THERAPIST Okay. That's another, that's a separate one. 

00:27:40
MARY JANE Yeah, because they, they don't really smoke, so usually when I go out with them, I don't, I might have a smoke before I meet them, but I wouldn't smoke with them. So I could maybe arrange to go for a coffee or go for dinner with someone from work. 

00:27:55
THERAPIST (crosstalk)Right. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. OK. Well, that's pretty good. We've got six of them. Is there anything else that you, you think might help? 

00:28:05
MARY JANE I could go see a movie. Usually I get stoned before I go to movies, but I could, I think I could, I think that would distract me enough to not.. 

00:28:15
THERAPIST Right. Are you saying go and see a movie alone or, or say you might meet David at the movies straight after work? 

00:28:20
MARY JANE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:28:20
THERAPIST : Okay. It's important with this to sort of just kind of keep going until you, you think you've covered every, every possible option. So um, I wonder if there's anything else lurking there? 

00:28:35
MARY JANE Well.. 

00:28:35
THERAPIST This, this is a very creative list. 

00:28:35
MARY JANE That's good. Well because it is so much linked to coming home from work, I could take some time off work and go away. 

00:28:45
THERAPIST Wow. 

00:28:45
MARY JANE Somewhere. 

00:28:45
THERAPIST Mm. So really interrupt the pattern, really sort of shake things up. 

00:28:50
MARY JANE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:28:50
THERAPIST So take some time off and break the, the kind of going home from work link. 

00:29:00
MARY JANE Yeah, yeah. I could do that. Normally though you know if we, if I get leave, then David and I would take it together and we'll go away and smoke a lot. 

00:29:10
THERAPIST (crosstalk)Sure. Yes. Okay, well look, let's, the-, there are eight things on this list. What I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna hand you this list and hope that you can read my writing. And get you to, to look at the list and think are there some, are there one or two that stand out that you think you could really have a go at. 

00:29:30
MARY JANE Mm-hmm. 

00:29:30
THERAPIST And cross out the ones that you think are really not on at this stage. Yeah? OK? 

00:29:35
MARY JANE Mm-hmm. OK. 

00:29:35
THERAPIST I'll give you that; there's a pen. 

00:29:40
MARY JANE Thanks. 

00:29:40
THERAPIST So what's the first one? 

00:29:40
MARY JANE Well the first one is drink alcohol instead and I know that I can do that, cause..I've been doing that. 

00:29:45
THERAPIST (crosstalk) You know you can do that, but, yeah.. Right. 

00:29:45
MARY JANE But, um, is that, is that okay to say yes to that, or..? 

00:29:50
THERAPIST Well, when you, when you suggested that one, you said I can do this one, but I, I guess um, it's kind of, it's got its own difficulties, hasn't it? 

00:30:00
MARY JANE (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:30:00
THERAPIST But, well, it's got a question mark at the moment. 

00:30:05
MARY JANE And the problem with that as well is that, um, I think that in some ways the alcohol is affecting my work as much as the dope. 

00:30:15
THERAPIST (crosstalk)Right. Okay. So there might be better ones on the list. 

00:30:15
MARY JANE Yeah, I might cross that one out. 

00:30:20
THERAPIST OK. 

00:30:20
MARY JANE Although, I probably will use it. 

00:30:20
THERAPIST Yes, yes. 

00:30:20
MARY JANE To be honest. 

00:30:25
MARY JANE Do sports. I could do sport, but it might take me a while to organize um, a sport you know like a club or to organize someone to do it with. And I think that I'm very unfit at the moment as well. My lungs are like shot, you know. 

00:30:35
THERAPIST (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Right. Okay. So I wonder if under sport might come, you know, going for a walk with someone from, from work. (inaudible ) after work. So a port might be a kind of more general thing than a team sport. 

00:30:50
MARY JANE (crosstalk)Yeah, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, like ex-, just to exercise. 

00:30:50
THERAPIST Yes. 

00:30:50
MARY JANE Yeah, so I should take that, do you think? 

00:30:55
THERAPIST Well, it's sounding like it's something that is appealing to you and maybe the longer term thing would be to get into a team sport where you've got a regular commitment, but I guess if you could link up with someone from work and go for a walk straight after work two nights a week, that would actually be helping you get fit again andOe so, that sounds like it's..feasible. 

00:31:15
MARY JANE (crosstalk)Yeah, I think I could do that. I think I could do that. 

00:31:15
THERAPIST Yeah? Okay. 

00:31:20
MARY JANE Stay at work late. I could do that. I could do that and it would probably be good for, you know, my relationship with my boss in my office. 

00:31:30
THERAPIST Okay. Right. So maybe staying one night a week (inaudible )might, might help. 

00:31:32
MARY JANE Yeah, yeah. 

00:31:32
THERAPIST Well we're not talking about doing this every night, mm-mm. 

00:31:35
MARY JANE No, thank God. Stay with my sister - I do go and stay with her sometimes. 

00:31:40
THERAPIST Mm-hmm. 

00:31:40
MARY JANE But again I normally get stoned before I go there. 

00:31:45
THERAPIST Right. 

00:31:45
MARY JANE But if I went straight from work to her house then I could probably do that. 

00:31:50
THERAPIST Ok. Right. So there's a bit of a theme developing here isn't again about breaking the patterns straight after work? 

00:31:55
MARY JANE Yeah, yeah. Arrange to do things with friends from work. Yeah I can do that. 

00:31:55
THERAPIST Mm-hmm. 

00:31:55
MARY JANE Yeah. Cause sometimes we do that like on Friday night, maybe we'll go to the pub after work and you know, because I haven't gone home, sometimes I'll have joints carried, but I try not to carry stuff on me anyway. 

00:32:10
THERAPIST Okay. 

00:32:10
MARY JANE But yeah, that would work. 

00:32:10
THERAPIST Well, that's, you've got actually quite a few that you've ticked there and that's, that's amazing. I mean often when I do this with people, there's really only one or two things. So you've actually got quite a lot of choices here. And, um, with the coming week, I, I wonder which ones, um, you know if you just picked one or two to make a start with, rather than set yourself all of these. You said it might take a bit of organizing with the sport thing. Um, I wonder in terms of staying at work late, staying with your sister, arranging to do things with friends from work, seeing a movie, not carry dope. I want to pin you down a bit so you've got one, one or two that you're gonna try this coming week. Which, which do you think? 

00:33:05
MARY JANE I'd probably rather like do things with David. So I'd probably see a movie. 

00:33:15
[music] 

00:33:15
Later in the same session 

00:33:20
THERAPIST Okay. So we've agreed that two that will be good to have a go at this week in terms of cutting back, would be to stay at work one night and work a bit later. That will kinda help you send a message to your boss that you're really serious about pulling your weight at work. You've been worried about that. And the other one is that you're gonna arrange to do something with people from work, one night after work. So that'll be two nights that, that help you create a different breach between work and going home. You still happy about those two? 

00:33:50
MARY JANE Yeah, yup. Yeah I think um think that um working late is a good idea cause I think I owe it to my boss as well. 

00:34:00
THERAPIST Yes. OK. Um, so, uh, given that that's gonna change your life a little bit over the next week, what about David? Where does, what, I'm wondering what you might.. 

00:34:10
MARY JANE Um, I mean, I obviously have to, because although he knows that I'm seeing you and that I'm trying to do something about cutting down, I don't he think he really, I mean I haven't told him about the panic attacks. I don't know how serious he thinks I am. I think that I'm gonna have to tell him about the panic attacks. 

00:34:30
THERAPIST (crosstalk) Hmm. Yes. Yes. Right. Okay. You look a bit worried about that. 

00:34:35
MARY JANE Yeah. I don't know why. I just feel embarrassed. 

00:34:40
THERAPIST Yeah. It sounds like he's concerned about you, and he's supportive of you coming here and perhaps, like you, he didn't really understand the link between, um, some of these sorts of problems. And that if, if you give him a similar kind of explanation to the one that we've gone through about how cannabis can, can feed into this kind of anxiety problem, that might help, hmm? 

00:35:10
MARY JANE I'm just not sure that he'll understand like you do. 

00:35:15
THERAPIST Right. Okay. Well one possibility down the track is that, is that David comes in with you. Um, you know sometimes it can be helpful. So that's something we mightOe 

00:35:25
MARY JANE I don't think he would. 

00:35:25
THERAPIST OK. Well, it's an option. OK. So, um, how do, you feel okay about implementing those, those two things in the coming week? 

00:35:40
MARY JANE Yeah, I'll try. 

00:35:40
THERAPIST Mm. 

00:35:40
MARY JANE I mean, I think I'll be able to do it. 

00:35:40
THERAPIST Right. OK. 

00:35:45
MARY JANE Work's just pretty hard at the moment. 

00:35:45
THERAPIST Yeah. 

00:35:45
MARY JANE I think it's a good, it's a good way for me to, you know like, minimize that time that I'm gonna be home and you know, therefore smoking. 

00:35:55
THERAPIST It will be a challenge. You're gonna be doing something quite different, and I think you'd be unusual if you, if you weren't feeling a bit apprehensive about it. But it seems to me that you really, you really do wanna do something about changing what's going on for you. It's not been comfortable. 

00:36:10
MARY JANE Yeah. 

00:36:10
THERAPIST Yeah? 

00:36:10
MARY JANE Yeah, definitely. 

00:36:15
THERAPIST And however it goes, whichever way it goes, we'll talk again next week and, and see what happened. And if things got in the way, well we'll look at that together. 

00:36:25
[music] 

00:36:25
Part IV: Relapse "I felt like a failure.." 

00:36:25
THERAPIST Okay. So, you, you're looking a bit flat. Tell me how the week's been. 

00:36:35
MARY JANE Well, it started off okay. Um, I did what we planned. 

00:36:45
THERAPIST Right. 

00:36:45
MARY JANE I stayed at work late. 

00:36:45
THERAPIST You did. Right. Wow. 

00:36:45
MARY JANE Yeah that, I mean that was fine, and I came home and I didn't smoke. 

00:36:55
THERAPIST At all? 

00:36:55
MARY JANE Not at all. 

00:36:55
THERAPIST Goodness. 

00:36:55
MARY JANE Because it was really late. 

00:36:55
THERAPIST That wasn't part of the plan. 

00:36:55
MARY JANE  I know. 

00:37:00
THERAPIST Right. 

00:37:00
MARY JANE But I just, I, I don't know why. I just like came home and I thought, so tired and I was like so beat by the end of it and I got lots of work done. 

00:37:05
THERAPIST Okay. Okay 

00:37:05
MARY JANE And then the next night I went out with a girl from work 

00:37:15
THERAPIST Mm-hmm 

00:37:15
MARY JANE and we went and had dinner 

00:37:15
THERAPIST Right. 

00:37:15
MARY JANE and that was good. 

00:37:20
THERAPIST Yup. 

00:37:20
MARY JANE And I came home and I did have a smoke. 

00:37:20
THERAPIST Right. 

00:37:20
MARY JANE But only one. 

00:37:20
THERAPIST Goodness. 

00:37:25
MARY JANE But then, the next night was the first time I'd seen David. 

00:37:30
THERAPIST Right. 

00:37:30
MARY JANE And he was just really mad. He said, "What's going on, you know. iYou haven't been here." 

00:37:35
THERAPIST Right. 

00:37:35
MARY JANE ..and I realized that, well I realized that I should've told him. I didn't end up telling him what was going on like I didn't tell him like I'd had this plan, and everything then. 

00:37:45
THERAPIST (crosstalk)Okay. Right. So, he wondered what was going on. 

00:37:50
MARY JANE Yeah. I should've talked to him beforehand, but I was just embarrassed to tell him about my panic attacks and everything. It's like, then like, it was just, then we just weren't talking and for the next night, and I just smoked and I've been smoking ever since basically, and I feel like I'm a failure. 

00:38:10
THERAPIST Oh. Okay. Well let me tell for a start that your first week sounds very much like most people's first week of having their first pass at making big changes. It's usually a mixed bag, and I really want you to focus on the fact that it is a mixed bag and not ignore the fact that at the beginning of the week, it sounds like you did a really good job of putting into plan the, into action the plan what we had. Hmm? Hmm? But what struck me is that the thing that got in the way uhm was the thing about David. And when I think back, you did tell me that you were really embarrassed about this, and I think perhaps I should've spent a little bit more time with you on that issue and that we talked in more detail about how you'd, you'd broach the subject with David. I think I made the assumption that you'd, you'd kind of managed that and that was probably a bit much. So how about we, we look at that now, how you might talk to David and feel less shy and embarrassed about this issue. And, and then we look at, at where you go from there. Hmm? Cause I really don't want you to throw away the successes you had. I mean you were telling me that you , you didn't smoke at all one night and you had one joint the next night. Hmm? And when you told me about that, it's like you remembered and you looked really pleased. And then you had the wind taken out of your sails when, when David said, "What's going on here? You're not around." So tell me, um , what it is that you fear in David knowing about the panic attacks? 

00:39:50
MARY JANE Well, I've been trying to think about it you know and I don't really understand why, I mean he's my partner and you know I don't understand why I can't tell him. I mean when, when he, like the next night after you know when I saw him, he just you know he came home from work and he wouldn't talk to me. And then, you know, I told him that I'm doing this and he's like, "Well why didn't you tell me?" And, you know, "Where have you been?" And, and I guess his reaction maybe helps me to explain why, why I can't tell him everything. Like, it's like he's always gotta be in control, and I think that somehow, I, I also feel like I wanna be in control. You know like we're both sorta trying to be cool or something, you know? And I just, because of that, I don't wanna, you know I'm embarrassed. I'm not embarrassed to talk to him about some things, but I guess I'm not really, I don't really understand this thing that's happened to me. Like I don't feel like it's me. 

00:40:55
THERAPIST (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Hmm. Right. Right. Okay. 

00:40:55
MARY JANE Does that make sense? 

00:41:00
THERAPIST Yes it does. Uhm I, I'm wondering if the best way might be, to put some of what you just said to me which sounds very plausible and reasonable and, and a good explanation to David himself that you, that you put to him that you uh, wanted to see if you could do this yourself, you know without, cause that seemed to be part of your plan that you wanted to do this yourself without needing his support or his endorsement. Um, and that it's felt actually bad not to be sharing with him and you really want to share it with him now, hmm? I wonder how he might respond to that. 

00:41:40
MARY JANE Yeah, I think that he'd respond well to that. Yeah. 

00:41:45
THERAPIST Okay. I mean if he's someone who likes to be in control, and you're telling him that you also would like to be doing the same thing. It may be that he can understand why you hesitated. Um, it sounds also like he might need some reassurance about this not taking you away from him. That this is a completely separate issue. That you wanna do something about your cannabis use cause it hasn't been as pleasant for you, uhm but that you really care about the relationship with him. It's primary for you. 

00:42:15
MARY JANE Hmm. Hmm. I think that he thinks that I can give up, like just give up without anything changing. I mean that's not gonna happen. 

00:42:25
THERAPIST No, no. 

00:42:25
MARY JANE Like things have to change. I mean I was thinking about it, and thinking that I can't go on with him, with him smoking every night the way he does, and I mean I know I have to talk to him about that. 

00:42:40
THERAPIST Right. OK. Well.. 

00:42:40
MARY JANE (crosstalk)Do you think? Oh, I'm sorry. 

00:42:45
THERAPIST No, go on. 

00:42:45
MARY JANE Do you think I have to tell him about the panic attacks? 

00:42:50
THERAPIST Uhm. I guess I'd like.. Well what do you really want, um him to know? 

00:42:55
MARY JANE I don't know why, but I just don't feel like I wanna tell him about that. 

00:43:00
THERAPIST Mm. It seems like a pretty big thing to be carrying on your own thought with your intimate partner not knowing. Seems like a huge responsibility or perhaps even a burden for you. 

00:43:10
MARY JANE Yeah, that's true. 

00:43:15
THERAPIST Hmm. It sounds like he's been very supportive of you coming here to get help and perhaps he needs a chance to know the full picture and to provide you with the support. If he doesn't, I guess we, we regroup about that and look, look at what might be getting in the way of him under- understanding and being supportive. Perhaps that's the point at which it might be useful for him to come in with you. You know we have talked about this in the past. Hmm? 

00:43:45
MARY JANE Yeah. Maybe. 

00:43:50
THERAPIST So, talking with him sounds like something that you that you do need to do. So that, um, you involve him more in coming back to the plan that we developed. And the plan seemed to make sense to you, and you got quite excited about the fact that it seemed more manageable than you had thought, hmm? And um, I'd like to think that you can pick that, find that enthusiasm again. Pick up again and have another go next week, hmm? 

00:44:20
MARY JANE Yeah, I know I have to. I, I think that maybe part of the reason that I um, that things went a bit wrong as well was because I was feeling quite uptight about not smoking. 

00:44:35
THERAPIST Yes. It will have an effect on you. It's not to be minimized. When you cut back on something that your body's been used to uhm pretty regularly, the cells get disturbed, and you are gonna feel a bit agitated, a bit different, a bit edgy, a bit restless. Um, and knowing that that's part of the process, uhm is often helpful. Well, you know there it is again, this restlessness that comes with me trying to make changes. And using some of the strategies that we've been working on to help manage your anxiety apart from, from uh cannabis use. 

00:45:05
MARY JANE Yeah, I did that. I did the breathing and everything. 

00:45:10
THERAPIST Yeah, good. Yeah that's fantastic. I think you're a bit of a hard taskmaster. You're asking a lot of yourself in a short time, hmm? And how long is it since you've had three days, three days, free, you know, with such little cannabis use? 

00:45:25
MARY JANE Two years. 

00:45:30
THERAPIST Yeah. 

00:45:30
MARY JANE I couldn't believe it when I didn't smoke that day. 

00:45:30
THERAPIST Absolutely. Yeah. 

00:45:35
MARY JANE It made me think maybe I just need to stay out late every night because I kinda came home and I was like well it's too late to have a, I just wanted to go to bed, you know? 

00:45:45
THERAPIST Yes. 

00:45:45
MARY JANE I just didn't wanna think about anything and.. 

00:45:50
THERAPIST Right. 

00:45:50
MARY JANE I, you know, just thought well maybe I just need to stay out late every night. 

00:45:55
THERAPIST Well that, that's possibly a bit unrealistic, but, but I think what maybe what happened is that you got absorbed in something that actually entertained you, interested you, and got you not thinking so much about needing to have a cone or two. Or maybe that can be brought in more into your life with you and David. But that seems like a challenge.

Part V: The Final Session Reviewing the Journey "I feel like it is my choice now..." 

00:46:20
THERAPIST How ya doing? 

00:46:20
MARY JANE  I'm good. 

00:46:30
THERAPIST Yeah? 

00:46:30
MARY JANE Yeah. 

00:46:30
THERAPIST That's terrific. Well we said last time, that this would be our last session, our last kind of formal session. Um, because you know from my perspective, you've been doing amazingly well and I know you've been pleased with some, some aspects of, of what's changed. So let's do a bit of a stock tape. How are things different for you? 

00:46:50
MARY JANE Well, I guess like you know, as you know now really my smoking is basically restricted to the weekends. 

00:46:55
THERAPIST Yes. 

00:46:55
MARY JANE Um, yeah, I mean I still have a smoke during the week at certain times, but I feel like it's more my choice now. 

00:47:05
THERAPIST Right, right. 

00:47:05
MARY JANE Yeah. I'm not like, I don't feel like I have to have a smoke anymore. 

00:47:10
THERAPIST And that's exactly, I remember back to the very first session we had. That's exactly what you said, "I wish I could, wish I could get back to where I just felt like I could choose." So you've accomplished that. 

00:47:25
MARY JANE Yeah. And I guess the other good thing as well is that David's really supportive. 

00:47:30
THERAPIST Right. 

00:47:30
MARY JANE And um, that he, that all my worst fears about our relationship haven't been born out in real life. I mean because he still smokes a lot, but he, he's very sort of respectful of my space and the fact that I actually don't want to come home every night to him and a bunch of people smoking bongs. And that's really helped. 

00:47:55
THERAPIST (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Okay. Right. Yes. That's fantastic cause you were really quite worried about what effect it would have on your relationship if you changed your pattern of use. 

00:48:05
MARY JANE Yeah, yeah. 

00:48:05
THERAPIST Uhm. So this bond with this man's been strong enough to, to navigate that territory. 

00:48:10
MARY JANE Which has kinda surprised me in a way. 

00:48:10
THERAPIST Yeah. Um, so, so things are, are much better in terms of how much you're using, the conditions under which you're using, you're choosing, the relationship with David's, um, strong, yeah. 

00:48:25
MARY JANE  Yeah. 

00:48:30
THERAPIST Is there anything else that's, that's changed that you feel..? 

00:48:30
MARY JANE Well, I guess we're talking about having a baby. 

00:48:35
THERAPIST Mm-hmm. Right. 

00:48:35
MARY JANE Yeah. So that's something that, you know, I wouldn't have even.. I mean we had talked about it sort of theoretically, but now we're actually talking about within the next few years actually trying for that. So, I think that that will then change things again as well. 

00:48:55
THERAPIST Right. Mm. Right. So I'm kind of reminiscent, for some reason my mind's gone back to how distressed you were right back at the beginning when you were, you, the very first time you made some changes and you came in and you, I think you actually called yourself a failure, cause you'd, you remember back to that week? 

00:49:10
MARY JANE Oh. Yeah, yeah, when I, I wasn't talking to David. 

00:49:15
THERAPIST Yeah, and when you kinda wiped out those first few days where you'd made a really big change. 

00:49:20
MARY JANE It's funny because like looking back at that now, like at the time I felt really, really bad, but now, I mean I realize that that actually made me talk to him, like you helped me to talk to him. And actually communicate with him and tell him what was going on and what I needed, and I think that that really helped in a way. 

00:49:40
THERAPIST (crosstalk) Oh. Hmm. Right. Okay. That's a really good principle to take out of that. I'm really glad to hear you say that because that's gonna arm you well in the future. You know there are hiccups in the process, which sometimes there can be in any change that we make we can, we can find ourselves kind of hitting a, a bit of a spot where we feel stuck, and if you can go home to that kind of principle, and say now how, what can I make of this? What can I learn from this? How can I build on this? Rather than see it as a failure or a step back. That's gonna be good insurance for you I think. 

00:50:10
MARY JANE Hmm. Hmm. I remember at the time I felt like it was a huge step back. 

00:50:15
THERAPIST Yes. So, this has been um, an interesting journey for you. I'm glad to have been part of it with you and uh, I wish you well. And you know that the door is here, you can come back if you feel like you at a bit of a stock tape down the track. But my sense is that from here on its really just about you keeping on doing what you're doing. You've been very successful. 

00:50:40
MARY JANE I couldn't have done it without you. 

00:50:40
THERAPIST It's a pleasure.
