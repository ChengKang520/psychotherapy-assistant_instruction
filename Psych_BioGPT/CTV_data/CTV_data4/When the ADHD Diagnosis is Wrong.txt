When the ADHD Diagnosis is Wrong

PAUL SWINGLE As, I think a lot of you will agree ADHD is a wastebasket diagnosis. Every child that they can't figure out, gets thrown into that wastebasket and then medicated or something is done to them. And fully half of the kids that come in with that diagnosis to see me have some other issue going on. And it's completely messed when you play with the foolishness of top down, rather than bottom up. So diagnostic criteria for ADHD inattentive version. Uh… you need six or more of the following for at least six months. Mike made reference to this kind of silliness earlier this morning. What if you have four? Okay. 

00:01:00

00:01:05
PAUL SWINGLE And for hyperactive type, the one that I really like is runs and climbs excessively. 

00:01:15
[sil.] 

00:01:20
PAUL SWINGLE This is the whole nonsense of going from symptom down to a label and then once you have a label, uh… then it's uh… fair game. All right, I can medicate, I can do all kinds of things. The only reason for using something like this is to get insurance companies to pay money period. Other than that, it serves no purpose in my judgment. Laurie uh… gave me permission to uh… advertise here. So uh… we're hiring people in Vancouver, Canada, okay. We need folks who want to come to the most beautiful place on earth uh… who can do Neurotherapy. So uh… the reason, I bring this up at this point, I'm trying to pursued you to uh… send us your uh… your data is uh… 

00:02:30
[sil.] 

00:02:35
PAUL SWINGLE to uh… emphasize the uh… issue of bottom up or just top down that people seem to have a terrible time embracing. Now, we have a lot of folks who like to uh… to get into the uh… business of Neurotherapy but have a lot of difficulty not falling back into what they know or what they know is testing, labeling and then treating the label. Okay, to really embrace the bottom up, you don't rely on any of that. It's what is the brain telling you about why that person is sitting in front of you. So if you feel, you can embrace that and live in the most beautiful place in the world, rattle my cage, okay. This is uh… something that appeared in the uh… New England journal of medicine. I think it was and uh… this was a kind of like an editorial and it nicely captures the problem of, of uh… uh… going from symptom to uh… to treatment. Symptom the label. This is a kid who was a refugee, it was in a refugee camp in Rwanda and he uh… was sent to a uh… psychologist by the school system because of inattentiveness, walking around, stealing all those sorts of things and it's very interesting that uh… they wanted to start him on medication. But when this psychiatrist uh… learnt what the kids uh… uh… situation was uh… he uh… in his uh… home uh… uh… school in Rwanda uh… there was no such animal as private uh… property in terms of pencils and paper that sort of thing. You know, everybody had access, you know, they were walking around and uh… he was just behaving the way, he understood to behave in school, okay. Now here is just the marked example of the whole system being wrong. You know, the schools sent them, the uh… they wanted him uh… treated for ADD and they needed a behavioral program for stealing or things of that nature. ADD is no joke. Uh… although, it's overtly uh… the diagnosis is uh… thrown on every kid, nonetheless, if you look at the risk factors associated with ADD, they're substantial, very substantial in terms of criminal behavior for example. Uh… the uh… there are uh… arrested roughly twice as frequently as the general population. Convicted again more than twice. The imprisonment, I think is really interesting 800% greater than the general population. Okay and as I say, there are certain forms of ADD in which our prisons are just loaded with these young males who have that uh… form of ADD in which the harder, you try the worse it gets. Now Mike was talking about having some sort of evaluation process so that we could identify these things early. Uh… one of the things that I uh… always felt strongly about is we should have these kinds of evaluations in the school and I don't mean the kind of test all the kids, kind of operation. If you had it as a resource room uh… service. So if a child is sent to the resource room, so something has been identified as a problem with this child. You do the assessment and you can eliminate oceans of grief because if you can identify what, where the uh… ADD is coming from uh… treat the ADD and you can identify if there are other problems that are causing the behavior. Okay, very simple straight forward. We would save a fortune, and we would save a huge amount of lives with this procedure. 

00:07:35
[sil.] 

00:07:40
PAUL SWINGLE Okay, this is a nice healthy uh… spectrum and if you look down here, this is your frequency spectrum. This is the algorithm, I was talking about, the frequency is inversely related to amplitude. The slower the frequency, the higher the amplitude. And you can see it bounces around a bit and you remember that one form of ADD that violated the algorithm in which uh… the alpha frequencies were very high, higher than the theta and uh… much higher than the beta. Okay, so this is a nice healthy uh… uh… brain wave spectrum. This is the slide, I showed you earlier. This is uh… a child with common ADD as I call it and that's simply a theta beta ratio that's up in the three or four uh… range and uh… the problem here of course is the elevated slow frequency uh… interfering with the child's ability to focus but this when you, when you uh… data frequency is really high in amplitude, this is also contributes to hyperactivity and what the child is doing is self medicating. That's what the movement is. They're trying to uh… sitting down is painful for a child like that and they're moving around to keep that theta down. That's what they're doing. So the, the way you treat the hyperactivity is not by medicating the child but simply by decreasing the amplitude of that slow frequency. This is uh… you know, when you're doing a full map with topos uh… you can see the uh… very high levels of slow frequency uh… activity covering most of the brain. This again, I talked about my first the talk, and that is the accuracy associated with uh… doing a clinical uh… Q and again the effect it has on clients or when you tell them why they're sitting there. Okay, the only thing I know about this fella is he's 16. 13, 13 years old and he's a male and he's not at all happy about being in my office. Okay, like, you know, a 13 year old who comes in, sits slouches in the chair, tries to look as disinterested as possible. Looks out the window, starts yawning. Okay, so I had no other information about this young lad and there are 90 numbers here the and they boil down into 30 or so. Now at CZ, what we're looking at here is he does seem to have a uh… an ADD issue. If you look at the eyes open theta beta, it's 2.9. Okay, no 2.7. And that's a bit on the high side. We want it below, 2.2 or so. But look what happened on the test. 

00:11:25
[sil.] 

00:11:30
PAUL SWINGLE Now on the test when he's concentrating, he's reading and the theta beta ratio should drop. They should be more focused, increased beta activity, decreased theta activity. This should go in the opposite way. This is that pernicious form of ADD that I discussed uh… in the uh… the previous talk. This is the one in which the heart of the child, the heart of the child tries the worst the condition gets. Okay, so what else have we seen with this young lad? Okay. Okay and he's, if you look at the uh… uh… delta is a little on the high side and this is the low high alpha. This is the ratio of low alpha 8 to 9 cycles a second divided by high alpha, 11 to 12 and that's uh… correlates with uh… alpha peak frequency. Now the reason that I use a ratio is this lends itself to classical conditioning better than trying to work with an average frequency. Now remember an average frequency is not a response. It's an average and that's not a response. This is a response in terms of the amplitude of the low frequency and I can put that into a brain driving protocol by simply suppressing slow frequency alpha, increasing fast frequency alpha. Okay, so I know something is going on there. One other thing that uh… is an area of some interesting concern is you'll see that the theta beta ratio on the eyes closed conditions is quite a bit higher than the on the eyes open condition. And, and that is a warning sign. So what do I say to this kid? I usually uh… start by asking him, are you interested in sport and fortunately this kid said soccer. So I told him about the Milan team and the Manchester team both of which had Bruno Denechalos (ph) as their sports psychologist and he introduced neurotherapy to the sports world and Bruno started what's called the brain gyms. So it's just like when they do their workouts in addition to doing their workouts, they do Neurotherapy and uh… it was extremely successful in Milan? Of course now all of the major uh… clubs have Neurotherapy. So any of that, that was an intro and I was chatting with the kid about sports and that we see an awful lot of athletes in my clinic and then I uh… said to him uh… Johnny uh… you have a form of uh… attention issue that's really a very nasty form. Uh… you know, you have some trouble paying attention but when you try to, to pay attention uh… you're unable to do it, in fact it gets worst. The harder you try the worst it gets and I go on and I go on about this and the kid starts to cry, he broke down which happens a lot by the way in my office. So after we talked about this, I asked his mother, I said would you mind if I spoke with Johnny privately. So she left and I said to Johnny, I don't want you to say yes or no. I just want to tell you something. Stop smoking dope. Now in Vancouver I'm gonna be right 50% of time anyway. Another reason to come to Vancouver. 

00:15:50
[sil.] 

00:15:55
PAUL SWINGLE Whenever you see that pattern of a disparity in terms of elevated uh… theta beta ratio, eyes closed relative to eyes open uh… we find that uh… very often uh… these kids have started uh… dope smoking. And as it turns out I was correct. He uh… had just started actually. He hadn't been on it for a long time. He's only 13 for goodness sake. But uh… when he was through, he uh… said to me, he said, you're the only person, you're the one person on the planet who understood, right. Now that's what the brain told me. I didn't ask his mother anything, I didn't accept any of the testing that they had done in school, none of that. Based purely on what the brain was telling me. This was very simple and straight forward. This is a simple form of ADD to deal with because what you have to do is tasking so that while the brain is under treatment the child is actually reading or writing or performing some kind of cognitive activity. And you can blow this away 15 or 18 sessions. And he stopped smoking dope too by the way. Uh… this is an adult male with that same form of ADD. See now eyes open uh… you probably uh… you know it doesn't add any condition that looks like it's an attention issue. It's high, you know, we want it below, 2.2 or so. But again under challenge, it goes up and that's the critical element. This is the omni harmonic, the one that you can get a free download of and we always test it ahead of time to make sure that it's gonna do what we want it to do as an unconditioned stimulus. So I know, if I turn that on, I am going to suppress the theta beta ratio in brain driving. This is a little uh… eight year old girl who has that form of ADD. You see it more in males than females, the type that gets worst the harder you try but what's very important here is to make sure that the parents don't get married to the numbers and you can have a lot of trouble with people who want to know second to second what their numbers are that I do better at this time than last time etc. and I'm very, very emphatic about that with individuals. Now this is a very good example of that. Uh… she started off with theta beta ratio of 3.5 which is quite high but look what happens when she's under treatment. Now remember she's got the type that gets worst under challenge and uh… Neurotherapy, neurofeedback is challenging. Okay, you have to pay attention and try to focus. So if the parents were married to the numbers, they'd say, it's getting worse. Okay, then she gets it. Okay. And this is uh… a letter that was written by the parents of that child and the uh… what's very important here as she started in the new school and one week into the new school, she brought her violin, I think it was into class to play a solo for the class and it's the mother said, last year this time that would have been impossible. So one of the things that you find when you're treating ADD in children is you affect the self-esteem and if you fix self-esteem, you fix everything, okay so this child was just a changed child, okay. If they had been married to the numbers, they would have been out there and they would have medicated the child. Okay, so that's why it's very important to be very upfront with individuals and you know, I take my uh… uh… I take my lessons from the pharmaceutical companies. When they are advertising, the first thing they tell you it is, if you take this drug things like bleeding has occurred uh… your immune system compromise, and uh… collapse, potential for death, okay. Then after they go through all of that to get your attention, the fact that this is powerful stuff then they say, but if it doesn't do any of that, it cures this. Okay, so what I do with folks that come in is to point out that anybody that tells you that Neurotherapy is completely safe and there are no possibilities for any side effects is a moron, they don't know what they're doing. Because they're messing with your brain. Okay. The second thing is if I'm trying to balance the front part of the brain, let's say, you have a depression mark where uh… beta is much higher on the right lower than the left and I try to suppress that. I may trigger something. I may trigger an imbalance where let's say the left side of the brain uh… uh… develops higher levels of beta. Okay the person may become more anxious. And when a client comes in and says, you know, I, I uh… feel like I'm getting more anxious uh… very possible let's have a look. I might have overshot, okay. In other words, the person really understands the issue associated with fine tuning that is where you're trying to get the brain is in its most efficient functioning and when you're doing that, you have to be very, very cautious about any kind of uh… unintended uh… effects on the brain. Okay now I also tell clients, I rely very heavily on what you tell me. And I want to know what's changing and if things are getting worst, I'd rather they get worst than not change at all. And the reason for that is I know I have a handle on it then. Okay, and umm… I'll show you a slide, you know, this talk one that follows on a heavily medicated client. Very heavily medicated, what you get is flat lining. Okay, now… Is there anything magical about the concept of ADD? There are neurological patterns associated with attention deficit disorder. But this for example is a form of an attention problem that's not, doesn't fall into the usual category of elevated slow frequency, some place where the child has difficulty uh… sustaining attention. And this is what we're concerned with here is this area over here the anterior singular gyrus uh… we're looking at the frontal uh… portion of that. That's the area associated with uh… obsessive compulsive disorder. And what you guys a lot of perceptive thought process is when that's uh… hyperactive. But as I pointed out in the talk uh… earlier. That's a double edged sword because if negative stuff gets caught in there then of course, you spiral into higher levels of anxiety, depression, whatever it is. All right, often you can't sleep because as soon as you close your eyes, the brain feels that's a good time to go over your shopping list. Uh… and in a child the problem is you can't shut the brain down. There is just enormous amount of chatter going on. So the treatment of this, requires that you decrease the activity in that sub cortical structure and the area that you're trying to suppress is very high frequency uh… beta and gamma. So you're doing 28 to 40 cycles a second down to quiet off that quiet that uh… area of the brain. And this is uh… what the child said uh… the note says, I couldn't believe it uh… when uh… she heard her uh… son saying that having ADD which is what he was calling it was kind of like having a song caught in your head. You can't think. Okay now, is that, you know, do we put the label of ADD on that or do we put the label of perceptive thought process or obsessive compulsive, you know etc., etc. And the reason is, this was a problem to the child is the having a lot of trouble in school. He could not focus, he could not attend because uh… he couldn't get the chatter out of his head. High frontal alpha form of ADD. This is the one I again talked about earlier. Uh… and what we're dealing with here is marked elevation of alpha in the front part of the brain and here is what I mean by violating that algorithm. Uh… the theta and then alpha is much stronger than uh… theta. Uh… so you a, you know, an inverted uh… uh… algorithm here. Uh… this individual uh… uh… you know, everything else looks okay. So this is the one again uh… that went undiagnosed in females. Because of the chattiness and socialablity factors associates with it. And this is what it looks on the top of just marked elevation of alpha activity in the front part of the brain. This rotates and I was gonna rotate it and stop it at various points to point out, you know the different forms of ADD. But it's too cumbersome uh… the uh… fact is here uh… do I go over one just look at a regular uh… map in terms of location. Okay. 

00:27:50
[sil.] 

00:27:55
PAUL SWINGLE You all know a lot of the stats in terms of marked elevation in the diagnosis of ADD. Uh… tremendous increase in the amount of uh… uh… methylphenidate being prescribed in Aderol and so forth and uh… the uh… uh… what they're uh… pointing out here is that the uh… adult market was saturated so now they are going after the kids. They start Schwartz interpretation of what's going on and again why the labels are so valuable to the uh… pharmaceutical companies. Because as soon as you slap a label on something, it means they're game. Okay, uh… 

00:28:50
[sil.] 

00:28:55
PAUL SWINGLE This one was in child uh… academy of child and adolescent psychiatry. Uh… the diagnosis uh… about 11% of the kids uh… in the 4 through 17 year old had received a diagnosis of ADD and this represents a 40% increase over, you know, roughly an eight year period. Now lots of causes of inattention. You know, we have head injury, we have depression, we have anxiety, we have bullying, family problems, sleep problems and physical problems. One of the issues associated with treating depression in young children is very often, they don't present sadness. You know, they may have a lack of joy kind of thing. Umm… but, what you do notice is lack of motivation and interest. And there are a lot of uh… individuals, that's their response when they have depression markers. They wouldn't call themselves frankly sad, they are just, you know, what's the purpose of all of these, okay. That sort of thing. The case of chatter-head. Okay, this one again, I showed you earlier uh… this is the depression marker and this is the anxiety marker. Uh… no particular markers for ADD. Now emotional problems in, in children. And we're looking at the co-morbidity of uh… the uh… child that has a behavioral problem. Emotionally and emotional behavior problem. About 40% comorbid with anxiety and depression. Uh… learning disorder is very high. Uh… autism, conduct uh… disorders uh… 60% have or had a uh… physical problem of some sort, allergies and so forth. Okay, uh… the point is that children that legitimately have a form of ADD are very likely to have all kinds of other co-morbidities as well. Now uh… the question uh… is not how do we label all of these stuff, the question simply is let the brain tell you where to go to fix it. Okay, you can imagine the mess, you can get into trying to put labels on some of the stuff. And all of you who are in clinical practice have clients come in, they have a list of uh… various diagnostic, diagnosis as long as you're on. You know, Bipolar and depression and all kinds of crazy things. And there is a wonderful cartoon, I don't think, I have it in this slide present of two mothers pushing baby carriages, okay and one saying, my child has just been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. Okay, and so where we're using this slapping this label on very, very early and again what I find with Bipolar, those diagnosed with Bipolar, always, always, always have elevated frontal alpha. That's why kids rise that emotional volatility and then of course, there are other ratios of depression markers and anxiety markers usually. Uh… number of children with emotional behavior disorders and parental depression. 19% mother depressed, 11% father depressed, 23% both parents depressed. Depression in the parent is a huge, huge problem. Because the parent is unavailable emotionally to the child and if the parent is medicated they doubly are unapproachable emotionally and I have a nice case of that, that I'll show you in just a moment. Okay. Sexual abuse, 25% females, 18, I think, it's 16% males. And the data I presented earlier 60%, 50 to 60% of children uh… up to age of 17 have been exposed to a traumatic level of emotional uh… event. Okay. Post partum depression. We always used to think that it was a mother's only but it isn't and, and again depression means emotionally unavailable. Okay. 

00:34:30
[sil.] 

00:34:35
PAUL SWINGLE So let's see what's wrong with this guy. Theta beta ratios up on top of the head are okay, they are both below. Uh… 22, there is your alpha response. Uh… alpha response is the difference between alpha eyes closed relative to eyes open. So if you measure eyes open, close your eyes, this should be a big jump in alpha, open your eyes, it should drop like a rock. Okay. And we can tell a lot from the alpha response. And I'm gonna be going over that in my next talk uh… how do you identify trauma on the brain maps and alpha is one of the ways of doing it. So this kid has very strong alpha. Uh… we want it above 50% in the back of the brain. He's sitting at almost 300% and we want it above 30 here. He's a 115. Now, this is what I call artist signature and I'll speak more about that a little later. Okay, so uh… what are we looking at in terms of the theta beta ratios. Now, here, we have an inversion of the uh… uh… the algorithm. So we're sitting here with an awful lot of slow, uh… fast frequency up uh… in the right pre-frontal cortex and that's your big mark of a depression. So here it is right here. So this kid was sent then with a diagnosis of ADD and we had absolutely no evidence of any ADD any where here. What we have is a big mark of a depressed mood state. And that other area of the brain that we were talking about anterior singular gyrus, uh… is markedly elevated, so this kid is frightening and worrying a lot. Okay, if you medicated this child, the condition, we get will be much worse. Okay, so uh… when we are looking at the uh… front part of the brain, uh… in this particular case, there was elevated uh… fast uh… frequency over on the right side of the brain, so there is your depression marker. This was elevated here, so uh… the kid was frighting a lot. 

00:37:10
[sil.] 

00:37:15
PAUL SWINGLE I spoke with you about this, this morning and again uh… the way, identify the fact that it was bullying is the alpha response. Remember, we want it above 30%. So there is your marker for trauma and when the alpha is blunted at CZ, CZ, it's more likely that the uh… trauma is going on presently or was recent when it's in the back of the brain, it tends to be more historical. I don't have decent data on that, that's just a clinical observation and it's not unimportant in treatment anyway. But uh… that's what uh… I tend to find. Okay, so this is the bullying situation in which the child is showing the trauma and he's showing uh… reactive depression and he's showing the emotional uh… volatility. So, the uh… uh… theta in the right side of the brain, that's the uh… emotional volatility. The uh… uh… I can't read that myself. Oh, yeah, the uh… alpha in the left front that's your uh… marker for reactive depression. And then the trauma marker. And uh… an awful lot of data coming out now and the effects of bullying and uh… huge uh… implications in terms of uh… psychosis and other emotional, emotional disturbances. And it's not only for the uh… bully but it's, and not only for the uh… victim but also the bully. and it's pretty compelling data for that as well. Now oppositional defiance. The pattern that you look usually looking for there is the elevated uh… alpha in the uh… right side of the brain, front part of the brain uh… correlates with uh… that, that symptom, oppositional defiance. Now that's the same area that's associated with emotional volatility, so there is obviously a behavioral component associated with that. And you know, the uh… the drugs of choice for oppositional defiance includes off label antipsychotics, among other things. 

00:40:15
[sil.] 

00:40:20
PAUL SWINGLE Okay, this is a uh… seven year old child and I call it a child in crisis. And this child has a perfect storm going. So you can see at CZ, we have the trauma marker and let's see… (inaudible ). And at the back of the brain, similarly, another trauma marker and the theta beta ratio in the back of the brain is well under two, sitting at about one, both eyes open and eyes closed. So very poor stress tolerance and probably sleep disturbance. And we have uh… a pattern that's associated with hypervigilance and that's where alpha is considerably lower than your beta amplitude in the front part of the brain. So you have an inversion there of the algorithm. That's a marker we usually see when you see the two trauma markers and alpha in the front, that's the hypervigilance where it's looking over your shoulder. And finally if you look at the delta in the front part of the brain, often children who have been traumatized show marked elevation of delta in the front. My guess is that's an effort to uh… suppress the emotionality associated with the trauma and the uh… summation of high beta gamma uh… is very, very high uh… 42, we want it below 15. That's fretting. Something on your mind constantly. Okay, what we found out is uh… they were trying to keep an unkeepable secret from this child. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and, and uh… they did not want to tell the child. Uh… and this is a child that was brought in for, you know, she was just having a terrible time at school etc. And when we went through this and I reviewed with it with her mother. You know, there is no ADD here. It has nothing to do with ADD. And uh… you know, then they went through a proper kind of counseling that will help, you know walk the child through this. Okay, mother brings two children in, both diagnosed with ADD, oppositional defiance and something else. And this is the uh… first child okay and this is seven year old Jane and what am I seeing here? I'm seeing trauma markers, okay. What about the ADD factor? Well, there is a little bit of excess of theta, beta, up over CZ but I'm very curious about this. Major trauma markers. Okay. There is a couple of other things going on. But that's the biggie. So what about her brother? This is Martin, two trauma markers. 

00:44:25
[sil.] 

00:44:30
PAUL SWINGLE And uh… he also has a marker here for uh… some depressed mood state. Okay, so uh… I uh… asked the mother about this. Now you can imagine if you had trauma markers in a child, how do you bring this up and how do you discuss this with the parent? Okay, because the cause of the trauma marker maybe sitting in front of you. And you don't want to alarm parents, you know, if I say this child has been exposed to a severe emotional uh… uh… event uh… immediately the parent thinks of uh… pedophiles and all kinds of, of things. So this is a hot potato and how do you deal with it, so kids leave the room of course and I start to talk to the mother about you know, these markers for exposure to severe emotional stress and the mother started to cry and I said, let me brain map you. Okay, so, this is Mrs. Kelly's and Mrs. Kelly has trauma markers and severe depression. So I know this kids are really in trouble because The mother is unavailable to them emotionally. It turns out that the father is extremely verbally abusive. Not physical, verbally abusive and very volatile and he flips all over the place. He is on all kinds of medication and he's been in this kind of situation for years and years and years and she said, everybody walks around the house walking on eggs because he can pop it any time. Fortunately, Mr. Kelly uh… came in. And he recognized that he was really a problem. A problem in the family. Uh… he was causing all kinds of difficulty. He was on every conceivable cocktail of uh… medication. What's his problem? 

00:47:00
[sil.] 

00:47:05
PAUL SWINGLE High frontal ADD. So we're treating the children for an attention problem that daddy has, okay. Remember high frontal ADD, the one issue is inability to pay attention but the other is emotional volatility. That comes with the territory with high frontal uh… high frontal alpha and that's exactly what he has. He's also showing trauma markers. Because in the, they find themselves in that kind of circumstance, you know, they are victims as well. So here is a perfect example of the incredible power of the clinical Q. This told me that there was a family issue, issue going on here uh… and I didn't know what the source of the trauma was but I did know given the mother's profile that she was not available to the kids, okay. So this is a perfect storm in a family context and the way to take care of the child's ADD is to treat the father. Now there is always a behavioral component to all of these things. You take care of the neurology, the behavior can have a life of its own. Okay, so that's what I mean by this no such animal as one size fits all in Neurotherapy. Neurotherapy is not a stand alone discipline, you know, just the Neurotherapy and go home. Whatever your therapeutic metaphor is, is what you're adding Neurotherapy to. 

00:48:45
[sil.] 

00:48:55
PAUL SWINGLE I have to watch sleep quality and with ADD. Uh… sleep depravation or more importantly poor architecture of sleep can make a huge difference in terms of ability to uh… uh… focus. Uh… sleep uh… issues, the way you see this in the clinical cue is when they close their eyes uh… you get a big jump in data. Should, should be going the other way. Now when eyes close beta is elevated that's usually a marker for some sort of sleep quality problem. Now, there are a lot of people who disagree with me. But in my judgment, there are only two phases of sleep that matter. One is deep and you need about an hour of deep to take care of body toxin transfer and so forth and REM, you need two hours of REM and REM is where the brain does its own psychotherapy and it does its filing. If you are not getting adequate, adequate REM, you study something, the next day, it's gone and a lot of students will tell you that. I study, I knew it, the next morning, I couldn't think, it's gone. Either they didn't sleep or they did not, do not have adequate REM. So a lot of things we pay attention to. If we're working in the area of trauma, now I'll discuss this much more in the next talk. Sleep quality is a big, big issue when dealing with traumatic stress. And these are the monitors we use. So we're measuring brain activity, this is wireless to the device. And these are the outputs of the sleep monitors. Uh… we uh… take home by the way. They take them home and they measure uh… sleep for at least for four consecutive nights. So it's in their own environment and we have a full cycle of sleep, not like the sleep lamps in which they want to get one 90 minutes sequence and based on that 90 minutes sequence, they see the ratios of deep and, and uh… REM are okay. This is much more accurate to be in their own environment. And this is a problem with uh… deficient REM. So you need about two hours of REM and I think, I can't read it from here. Yeah, 90 minutes of REM is all that a person has. Okay, okay on deep but no, the REM is really a problem. Uh… here is deficient deep sleep, very little uh… deep sleep and a lot of awakenings, okay. And the way you treat sleep issues, once you know what they are, again it is Neurotherapy and you can identify the conditions that are giving rise to disruption in the sleep architecture. Then you getting the monitor to take home, show them whether they are sleeping fine? Uh… then you can tell them that your president only sleeps four hours a night. So he claims uh… and uh… but the fact of the matter is you can get away with lot less sleep than the traditional 8, 9 hours. If you have one hour of deep and two of REM. My daughter just wrote a book, I Mind and the problem we're having with our fascination with walking down on the street like this is incredible, just incredible what it's doing. Uh… we have a lot of uh… kids who, who's problem is eight to nine hours of gaming a day. They are also using computers in their school work. So it's very difficult to be able to monitor that and restrict the amount of online time they have? If you want to find a see a true addict, find a child that, that games five or six hours a day and take it away from them. And we've had circumstances in which the child just lays on the floor and screams, okay. So uh… how we come to terms with this is a problem because it's the reality of our, our life now. And you know, children don't sit down and talk with one another. They text one another, right even if they're in the same table. So all of that batter in terms of what goes into developing relationships is uh… in, you know, under real threat. Okay. We have a situation and this tends to be mostly males, I find unlaunched males sitting in the basement of mommy's house. Doing important work on the computer, okay trying to figure out what they want to do 40 years of age I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do. And gaming really helps me quiet down and think. 

00:54:50
[sil.] 

00:55:05
PAUL SWINGLE And this is something that been recognized and which if a child goes to school too soon, then the immaturity factor is misdiagnosed as ADD. Then they are medicated then they are uh… labeled and then we have a lifelong problem. So what parents are doing now quite a few parents is they are holding a child back and then starting them, if they feel that's a problem. 

00:55:35
[sil.] 

00:55:45
PAUL SWINGLE Now, this is another thing that we find and children of problematic parents have problems. And you get a real bias in terms of uh… of the reporting of the child's symptoms. Where that really came home to me was uh… I saw it, a child over an uh… when I was practicing in New Hampshire uh… ADD, kid had mild ADD treated the kid and the uh… uh… kids report card came back all Bs or As, one C. Child happy as a pig in mud. I'm ready to get out of the (inaudible ) and waiting for other referrals. I got a all from the mother, we're going to medicate the child. I don't think, that I think we can do about this. And I called her back and said, I'd like you to come in with your husband, okay and it turns out that the family was in a lot of trouble. Uh… there was talk a lot of talk about divorce, separation and the child's ADD was what it was holding that relationship together. The child could not get better because if the child got better, according to the mother, then it was curtains for the marriage. And both parents, the male recognize that and then the mother after examining her own behavior recognized that because as a kid, I know, we have all of the data indicating that he was doing perfectly well in school and the mother was just not able to see it and her behavior was hovering over the child while he was doing homework and talking to the child, I know, this is very hard for you, etc. 

00:57:55
[sil.] 

00:58:00
PAUL SWINGLE Okay, you will know all about these. This is just a game that the kids play uh… that spaceship moves when the brain is doing what we want it to do and then the tasking that I was talking about earlier, again, okay, so working with ADD brain driving to make a huge difference uh… for the reasons, I spoke about in my uh… previous lecture because the area of the brain associated with the problem can be under direct classical conditioning while the child is actually engaged in reading, reading and summarizing, of writing, an output problem and so forth. Extremely efficient, thank you. 

00:58:50
[sil.] 

00:58:55
UNKNOWN So what questions, might you have for Dr. Swingle? Anyone? Yeah, please. 

00:59:05
UNKNOWN Paul, uh… you know, in the U.S. uh… 35 years ago, there were about 40,000 children that had received a Bipolar disorder diagnosis, now there is about two million and about a million of those children are being given a psychoactive drug and antipsychotic drug. You see children that come into your clinic with a label given to them by psychiatrists. Often is the label is correct. How often do you think that this is a real problem because of cultural, other differences that are driving changes in the brains of children or do you think it's exaggerated and it's uh… in, intriguement by psychiatrists and other medical doctors? 

00:59:50
PAUL SWINGLE You know, uh… personality, uh… multiple personality disorder uh… is a North American condition. You don't see it any where else. Uh… with regard to the labels, uh… I don't think it captures anything. You know, I'm so antilabel that, you know, if a child comes in with the diagnosis of Bipolar, there is an implication that they are untreatable other than to be medicated. That's the implication of that, that label and I strongly believe that psychiatric labels don't peel off easily because it becomes part of the system. And then it defines the child and then you create a problem. Uh… ADD, I think uh… is pretty straightforward that when the psychiatrist says, this child has ADD, the child is having a learning problem, it's the way, I interpret that. It may not be ADD, it maybe bullying or anyone of these other things. So again they're following the DSM, what kind of symptoms does he has and if he has X number for X amount of time then he has X label and I, you know, I think the hit rate is remarkably low with regard to that and certainly in terms of determination of, of uh… proper treatment because whatever the label is then they start try this and call me in a week routine and if that doesn't work, do shift off and try this and call me in a week etc. Okay, so the actual labeling may give rise to the first uh… the first for a treatment but when that doesn't work, you're into a try this, try that. 

01:02:00
UNKNOWN I'm a member of the National Academy of Medicine and I've been trying to get the National Academy of Medicine to take this on as an issue and try as I hard, they seem uninterested in resolving this question. Because I think it's likely that you know, uh… the great majority of those children are being mistreated by the medical profession. 

01:02:25
PAUL SWINGLE I agree. 

01:02:30
[sil.] 

01:02:35
UNKNOWN Uh… thank you for your talk. I really appreciated it. Uh… you mentioned marijuana use and I was wondering if the research that you've read or been a part of can contribute to the debate about the negative or positive consequences of marijuana use. 

01:02:50
PAUL SWINGLE Yeah, umm… the amount of marijuana that a person under the age of 28 should be using is zero. And I'm saying 28 now because the brain is still in a developmental process and there is compelling evidence that uh… marijuana consumption at a young age cost you about eight IQ points. Now, I'm talking about heavier use of course and not about you know, one off kind of thing. Uh… having said that, I think this is an area where I think psychology may be able to make some inroads because medical marijuana is very useful if properly prescribed and you need the right kind of mixtures, not the kinds that they are trying to push where it's all of the psychoactive stuff and very little of the body stuff but what they require now for uh… medical marijuana is a diagnosis. You don't need a prescription for it, you need a diagnosis, okay and since psychologists could diagnose, then we should be able to prescribe medical marijuana and there are forms of this that can be very useful, obviously cancer pain is the big one. Uh… but for also for in terms of sleep. Now, having said that, I much prefer to correct neurology of it than to suggest that somebody takes marijuana go to sleep, what's the difference between that and taking any other medication. Uh… I don't think it's an efficient way to go. But for things like terminal pain, that's a different ballgame altogether. 

01:04:45
UNKNOWN I am, I think, I gave case studies from the children's home to you and Dr. (inaudible )earlier and I was just wondering if you would respond to any of the case studies. I don't know if you remember them. Anybody who probably is someone who wrote them. But you gave me an interesting idea about you know, clinically what to do with the case study. Did anybody brought a case study that was given to me? Do you want to, would you mind sharing one and ask because he's gonna give you a very interesting answer, could you share yours? You have to come up here though. Okay, you think, I think we have another question, please come on up. 

01:05:25
[sil.] 

01:05:30
UNKNOWN I'd like to talk to you about that job later. 

01:05:35
PAUL SWINGLE Hey, you're hired. 

01:05:40
UNKNOWN Earlier, you talked about the very effective short term results. You talked about stabilizing with some neuron feedback. Could you please talk a little bit about the longer term effects? 

01:05:55
PAUL SWINGLE Yeah, sure. Uh… good point. I never discharge anybody without a home, home treatment protocol. The same model is going to a gym, you know, you go to a gym, get yourself in super shape, you don't then go home, sit on a sofa and eat potato chips. It don't work like that. You have to maintain it. So once you get your body to a decent shape, then instead of going everyday for three hours, you might go three times a week to maintain the body in the shape, in order to maintain it. So that's with the brain, exactly the same. So once we get the uh… situation under control then we give them a home treatment protocol which is usually something like a harmonic. Now we have harmonics that balance the front part of the brain. Uh… we have harmonics that increase slow frequency for sleep and stress tolerance. We have harmonics that suppress excessive fast activity. For attention issues. So let's just say, it's a child with ADD, we got it under control. Then what they're doing is they are using the omni harmonic when they are doing their homework to sustain the uh… gains that are made uh… and we may have one that's uh… you know, just was sharp enough the front part of the brain. So it's a maintenance kind of procedure. Uh… the other thing I tell the clients uh… consider us to be the GPs of your head. So if something starts to happen, it looks like it's got legs, come in immediately because if you come in at your level of training, we can probably put it to bed in one session, okay, using brain driving. Now that sets up an expectation. It sets up a model of vigilance, okay and what I mean by legs is uh… everybody gets depressed of course. But if it's lingering okay then you want to come in and have a clinical Q done. Takes six minutes of recording time remember for all things we've been talking about and isolate what the problem is and put it to bed. 

01:08:20
[sil.] 

01:08:25
UNKNOWN I'm interested in your umm… like I heard you talk about evidence of trauma and then your ADHD and the betas and the all that kind of stuff. I'm interested in the issue of motivation lacking and I just like a little bit of like which are the conditions associated with that and what are the ways, it looks like I'd be interested to you know. 

01:08:50
PAUL SWINGLE Yeah, there is lack of motivation, interest is almost always depression. Neurologically. However, the big issue that you have is again behavior and one of the things we find with internet addiction is that it deprives the child of interest and motivation. So they are constantly sitting glued to this stimulus and uh… they give the uh… the impression of having no interest or motivation for anything else and that's an addiction, that's the problem with that and whenever we run into a child that uh… just seems to have, you know, no, no interest in anything almost always looked at depression of some sort. And that's when the right side of the brain is more active than the left and the frontal regions. 

01:09:45
[sil.] 

01:09:55
UNKNOWN So umm… Dr. Swingle, you said that a lot of times uh… the exercises require a lot of sustained attention and can be very frustrating for these kids or even adults sometimes. Umm… the kids that I work with have severe mental illness, so a lot of emotion disregulation and inattention, hypervigilance, the whole gamut. Umm… so I'm just wondering like do they need to have a certain level of stability in order to begin doing their own feedback or brain driving umm… or how do you get these kids to sit still long enough to engage and keep coming back. 

01:10:25
PAUL SWINGLE Yeah. Uh… we see an awful lot of kids with very severe conditions and one of the few practices that will actually treatment psychosis with Neurotherapy. Uh… the problem with uh… uh… an ODD kid uh… and children that have major emotional disregulation is the whole uh… issue of consistency. So the ability to start the treatment and have them sustain themselves in treatment. Uh… the people who we have working for us are just miraculous in their ability to deal with these engage the child, give them uh… you know get them interested in the game. Uh… we have a I should tell you we have a secret weapon and it's called the treasure chest and in the treasure chest, there is no candy, there are no trinkets, no plastic toys, what there are in, what's in the treasure chest are fossils and minerals and semi precious stones and coins from all over the world and what they do, they are allowed one per visit and a lot of them will start collections of these things. A uh… coin dealer once told me, he said, Paul, you know, if you get kid interested in collecting stamps or collecting coins, you get them interested and in terms of mathematics and in terms of geography, you know, it's very interesting. And with fossils, we have the ecological scale, you know, so that they can see how old it is and we don't fool around. We have real dinosaur bones in there. So there are a lot of ways to answer your question, a lot of ways, we try to engage the child so that coming is not seen as, as a punishment and we do a lot of talk about optimal performance. So we make a lot of references to the uh… athletes that are coming for treatment for optimizing and uh… it's a skill set, you know. 

01:12:50
UNKNOWN Umm… do you do treatments, oops, sorry uh… with the kids while they are on medications or do they not have medications while they are doing it? 

01:13:00
PAUL SWINGLE We prefer them not to be medicated and you know, methylphenidate has a short life so uh… typically, if they don't give it the night before, you know, uh… that helps but the you know, if they have to be medicated, they have to be medicated. We'll treat them, we treat a lot of people on medication like titrate off. That's another issue by the way. Uh… a lot of uh… psychiatrists that we run into will scuttle our ship in terms of when the time comes to uh… titrate the person off medication, they'll do something like oh, you're taking two, take one, you know, that's a huge, huge the uh… uh… change. When you talk about titration, you're talking about statistical units not pharmaceutical units and you want to come down 10% and then 10% and you sit there for a week or two until, you know, everything is hokey dory and then you come down another 10% and if it's a problem with not being able to divide the uh… the uh… tablet, then we have a compounding pharmacist, they put it in a Elixer. So that you have absolute control of uh… coming down. Because some drugs are very unforgiving, you know (inaudible ) effects and so forth are nightmares to come off. And sometimes uh… we get a physician just to swap from something like beuterin (ph) to (inaudible ) or more forgiving drug and then come off the more forgiving drug. 

01:14:50
[sil.] 

01:14:55
UNKNOWN Hi. 

01:14:55
PAUL SWINGLE Hello. 

01:14:55
UNKNOWN Thank you for being here today. Umm… okay, uh… this is one of our clients in foster care. Uh… he's had multiple placement, he's been in care for several years. He's experienced physical abuse, neglect, he's currently ten years old. Umm… physical abuse, neglect uh… probable lead poisoning. He has speech impediment. He has difficulty with peers, hyper-vigilant, disturbed sleep, umm… possible dyslexia. Uh… he has excessive imaginative play. Umm… obsess, obsessive with, with super heroes. Umm… very, very distractable. Umm… an obsession hard to get him off the topic of super heroes and imaginative play. Umm… yeah, that's the case, any questions? 

01:15:50
PAUL SWINGLE Autism? 

01:15:50
UNKNOWN Maybe. 

01:15:55
PAUL SWINGLE Okay. I'm pretty good at working with those kinds of kids because I'm 80 and grumpy, okay. And they like to pull my chins okay. But who can play that game, okay. It's very similar to what I was saying before with the trouble child. It takes people who really know what they're doing and have the skill for that and we're hiring our technicians, that's one thing we can't train. You know the ability to that level of uh… empathic understanding to be able to embrace a child like. So Neurotherapy is a very small part of the equation. What is really a part of the equation is the behavioral treatment associated with this. Once you get the brain in some degree of uh… of, of efficiency. Having said that I find that after a couple of sessions with a child, if you structure it properly, they're gonna notice something. And you start to really, really work on their core emotional belief about themselves. That's actually that's my search for the Holy Grail. We're getting very close to being able to treat classically, condition pre-conscious processing. You know, about 70% of behavior is you react and then you find a reason for your behavior and one of that is pre-conscious in terms of how you react to somebody or emotional balance associated within when you're acting with them and that's why eating disorders are so difficult to treat because it's a core emotional belief problem. And self-loathing is not too strong a term. The way, you get at that is not with chat therapies. They are not efficient. It's only we have at the present time but our hip break with things likely of this sort is terrible. When we go after the core emotional belief in pre-conscious processing using classical conditioning, that's a game changer. We have some preliminary data on that. But the uh… uh… the timing, you know, you only have about a 180 milliseconds to classically decondition that kind of response. Yeah. 

01:18:35
UNKNOWN I think, it might be interesting to think about how we would think about this as a difference because you asked us (inaudible ) respond to this. What would you say, think about it. I agree with what Paul says uh… thing you have to do is, you have to deal with the fact that the child is hyperreactive and, and there has to be a strategy that basically brings a child under emotional control on some level. And part of that is to think about how you could train the child in, in their strategies that you use, to reregulate the system sort of controlling emotional state. And it's, it's very, that's all plastic. They are trainable and connected to this, are the strategies the brain is using to control a state of arousal. The brain basically is, is uh… the hyperaroused and you have to move it in a, a, you could say a down, a shut down direction. If it's, if it's under aroused, it's fundamentally unresponsive and you have to move it in a upward direction. But this is all plastic. So when we think about this, we think about the first dealing with these core resource you can't get any where, he would say in response to your question until the child is in some level of personal control. Now when they are under control then everything is possible. And you can look upon the array of problems that the brain has. So we, we look at people in some of our studies in which everything is wrong. For example, we have a symptomatic person, let's say hunting, hunting it seems affect everything. You look at everything, you're going like, almost any ability and it's sub normal, maybe drastically sub normal and if you wait long enough, it's affecting the psychiatric profile of a person, all kinds of competitive ways. Everything is approvable. Now, it takes a lot of effort for us, there is no shortcut to it. We sort of have to go down the list. So now we're in the Huntington space. We try to prevent the progression of the condition, so they don't have a terrible collapse, the Huntington disease. So they don't really become severely symptomatic. It takes about a hundred hours to stay (inaudible ). Once they're, once they are stable then the maintenance is relatively modest compared to the stabilization. Again as Paul says, once you have a person that's in a (inaudible ) state, you have to pay attention to how they are maintaining. Sometimes, that's very easy. For example, when we train a child that's ADHD, we find that it's not just stable but once we complete training, their abilities continue to improve on their own for a substantial period of time. They actually get better and better. So initially, it looks just like you've given him the drug and then after, afterwards, you look six month later, a year later, and they're substantially stronger on their own. The same occurs in for example a women that has breast cancer surgery and has chemotherapy. You train them, the end of training, they look like they're pretty much in the middle of the distribution. Six months later, they look better than that. So they get into this already, which they are using these sort of (inaudible ), continue to prove. You train a person and you improve their ability to recover their brain speed which is a critical faculty. And scientists have estimated how much more they have to train each year to keep it up. And the estimate is one hour on a computer per year. That's their answer. Now, we, we would do more than that. Just to be conservative. But it doesn't always take a lot to maintain it. What's critical is that you monitor it. Then once you have a person in, in a better situation, you are worrying about sustaining their brain health. So we have, Paul and I are both optimistic about using these kind of resources to drive changes in brains and I think we both believe that there is a real future in using these strategies to drive these broad corrections and people have even struggled in this sort of complex way.
