THERAPY Talks 

00:01:27
It began with a journey to India . . . 

00:01:27
Love is the wish to make someone happy, Dalai Lama 

00:01:27
Pat Love Ed. D. 

00:01:27
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. So it all began with a journey to India. My friend and colleague, Dr. John Carlson, invited me to join a small group that consisted of four practicing Buddhist and four academics. To travel to India to Dharamshala to actually meet a private audience with his holiness, the Dalai Lama. Now I'm not a practicing Buddhist. But like many of you nar, who already know, that Buddhism is actually come to the West as a psychology, as a practice. As an old, old way of understanding human behavior. And when John asked me, I had basically read everything the Dalai Lama had written. And, uh, and of course John had. And our idea was not only to go and to take part in this wonderful activity. But to ask his holiness if we might use his teachings to write a book, to help others here in the United States. So we go to India. And by the way, I got nominated to do the asking. Now, you know, I do talks all over the world literally. And, and I love, I love talking. I love teaching. I love educating. And generally speaking, I don't get really anxious or nervous. I was anxious my knee caps were, like, bouncing up and down. I didn't even know my kneecaps could move involuntarily. But anyway, we go there. And I had this long treatise about how we wanted to use his work, and honor his work. And how the work would help relationships, and families, and individuals. I had this, you know, long explanation. And he just, when I asked him of we might use his work. He just looked at me. And he looked at his, his secretary. And he looked back and he said, 'Sure. Why not?' And, and then it was like, oh. And then we had this whole wonderful activity of an hour of asking anything we wanted in this discourse. It was fabulous. What came out of that are the questions I want to give to you. What came out of that wa-, was really a way of looking at your life. That will, I think, not only define you. But form guiding principles of, of your life. Um, and it by, it's very, very practical. It's a strategy. It's an approach. It's actually a technique that I use with clients, and in m-, my own life, and in families, and with friends. So the first questions is this. Who are you? 

00:04:00
Questions #1 Who are you? 

00:04:05
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Who are you? Uh, what do you stand for? When, uh, when you're dead and gone, how do you want to be remembered by the people that you love? And maybe what's e-, even more important. How do you want to be experienced on a daily basis? What are the values, the principles that drive your life? I, when I work with clients. I, I actually ask them these questions. And I write down their answers. And, and, and I often get that blank stare when I ask. But I say, you know, well, think about the people who you admire. Why do you admire them? How do you want people you love to remember you, or to experience you? And I actually write down what they say. And I ask them to come up with at least three. And of course you can have far more. Now this is a fabulous strategy. Because let's just say, I wrote down kind. And I wrote down supportive, or loving. Or I often get integrity for men. Um, when a t-, when a resistance, or a difficult place happens in therapy. What I often can say is, what would a loving person do right now? What would a kind person do? What would a man of integrity do about this? what would a creative woman do right this moment, in this situation? This is more what we call values driven therapy, or counseling. So this idea of who are you isn't just an ideal. Ideal are ideas that you have, that a-, that don't have behavior to back up them up. In fact, here's what I think is a really working, working value, and a core value, and how it would work. At the end of each day I'll be able to ask myself, Pat, how were you kind today? And I ought to have an answer. And the end of each day I should say, How were you supportive today? And I ought to have an example. And it can be little. It doesn't have to be huge. And that is a values driven life that give you integrity, and in congruence. And by the way, when you're congruent. Other people feel that. They feel it coming from you. 

00:06:20
Pat Love Ph. D. 

00:06:20
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. And, and this is where you don't, you don't have regrets, when you're following your values. Knowing who you are, and moving towards that value is extremely, extremely important. Let me give you another exercise that's powerful in families, or, or frie-, even with friends, but also with couples. Let's say we have two people in my office. You know, we have, we have Chris and we have Gene. And I get Chris' list of core values. And I get Gene's list of core values. And I have them write them down. And then I have them trade papers. And I have Chris tell Gene, look at one of those values. And think of an example, a behavioral example that Chris has seen Gene act out. And tell Gene, with eye contact, in a kind, loving voice, I saw you in a loving act when you did fill in the blank. You talk about an exercise that takes couples to a deeper level. Because we like people who like us. But we love people who see the best in us. Second question, are you connected? 

00:07:40
Questions #2 Are you connected? 

00:07:45
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. What are we talking about? We know we're lot live breeders. We're, we're dependent on the care of other individuals. We're tribal. You know? We live in groups. Uh, we're relational beings. And so what do we mean by connected? Connection basically has four steps. How do you (inaudible) and think about who are the people in your life that fit these four criteria? Number one, they show up. Even if it's boring. Even if it's difficult. They show up. They're the ones who show up for the, you know, the celebrations, or the long graduations. Or even for the parties, or to help out. Or when you're in trouble, or you can call them, they show up. Number two, they tune in to you. They, they sort a, they're really there when they're there. 

00:08:35
Pat Love Ed. D. 

00:08:35
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. So you get the sense that they're interested in you. So they, they, they're tuned in. And number two, three, they tune in long enough to understand you. You know? It one thing to be tuned in. but you have to understand the person. But number four is even the most important. And that is their behavior is congruent with their understanding of you. Their behavior shows and proves that they really do understand you. Now we need about three to five of these people. We need people who will show up for us. We need people who really do tune in to us. Don't just use us as audience, you know, to their monologue. And we need people who understand us. And also people who's behavior shows that. But let's flip it over to the other side. We need to be that for others. We need to be that for others. That's what infants need. That's when we need as adults. That's what we need as we're aging. So this, this connections is vital. Because we're not live breeders. To feel safe, to feel productive, we have to be connected. Here's the third question. 

00:09:50
Question #3 Are you living in community? 

00:09:50
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Are you living in community? And, you know, I mentioned earlier we're travel. And, and the only way you feel connected. The only way you really have this sense of belonging, the safety of the corporate group, is to invest. So how do you invest? And this could be, uh, a religious group. This could be community. It could be sports. It could be fun activity, professional, you know, neighborhood. It could just be hanging a wreath on your apartment door that says, Happy Holiday. Or keeping your lawn clean, because it improves the neighborhood, I mean, whatever. So this community investment, but it only counts if you put something in. You only feel like you belong when you invest. So are you living in community, number one? But what is, I mean, what community do you belong? Where, where are the groups? How are you connected? Because, again, you know, there's no such thing as a baby. There's only a baby, and a caregiver. We have to have contact with other human beings to survive as infants. But we now know it's one of the single greatest predictors of health and longevity to thrive as an adult. Having a stable, social unit. And to belong to this community. And you belong by investing. You belong by time, energy. Not just your money. Time, energy, investing, giving back, meeting up, making an effort. So that third question, are you living in community? Number four, are your particular talents, are your talents being utilized in meaningful work? 

00:11:55
Question #4 Are your talents utilized in meaningful work? 

00:11:55
Pat Love Ph. D. 

00:11:55
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Now, everybody has a particular talent. It could be for making biscuits. It could be for, you know, um, bringing people into a group. It could be socializing. It could be for calming the group down. It could be for particular skill at computers, technology, whatever, okay. So there are, there are three ways to use talents. Number one, it could be in your job. You know? But a job is what you get paid to do, so you'll have money to survive. And maybe help others survive. By the way, there's a lot of dignity in just completing a job. Not everybody has to have a career. You can have a job. And it finishes. And you're done. And you go home. And then maybe after you go home, that's when you use your talent in meaningful work. And what do I mean by meaningful? Meaningful has to focus back to your core values. Which are the answer to number one. So it's gotta feed into who you are. What you hold dear. So, so there's a job. There's also a career. Now careers, there, there's an implication here. That as you get better, it's intrinsically rewarding as you go along. So it's meaningful to you. As you move through, and learn more about your career itself. So it can have meaning just by learning more, and become better at a career. And then there's a vocation, or an avocation. Which means that you might even get paid or, for having worked that feeds directly back into your core values. Now core values are important. And it could be just supporting your family. But that could be a supportive. Supportive might be a part of your core value. And then lastly, this is my last question. Are you living out the purpose of your life? 

00:13:50
Question #5 Are you living out the purpose of your life? 

00:13:50
Pat Love Ph. D. 

00:13:55
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Are you doing what you were brought here to do? Do you feel like your life has meaning? Do you feel like your life as integrity? And if not, what would take it? What would take it back into a place of meaning or integrity? Are you , do you feel like you're on a beam. Uh, just recently I attended a funeral, and a wake, and a celebration of life for a dear friend of mine, uh, Bonnie Pierson. Who, by the way, in Texas hold license, professional license number one. And I sat in her funeral, and heard that celebration of her life. And I thought to myself, wow, this is a women, and I knew her well, who lived out the purpose of her life. She's a woman who exemplified love. And love was one of her core values. So here's the question. Are you living out the purpose of your life? Do you feel like, A, you know your talents. Have you, are your, have your talents been discovered? Do you even know what your talent is? You know, by the way. Just let me say one thing about the talents. A lot of people live their life, and never discover their hidden talent. This is, was a research study. Because they only do what's easy. Often times your talent lies in an area of difficulty. You have to hone it. You have to shape it. So are your talents being used in meaningful work? You may or may not be getting paid for it. But your life has to have that meaning. Are you living in community? Do you, and living in community does't mean i just, I just, you know, exist here. I'm investing time, money, energy in some segments of a community. So that I feel like I belong. Am I connected? Not only do I show up. But have people who will show up for me. And am I living a life in line with my core values? These are the answers that can not only define your life, but give you a delightful life.

THERAPY Talks 

00:16:11
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Well, that was a delightful talk. Thank you, Dr. Love. 

00:16:20
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Thank you. 

00:16:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Um, there are a few things that I really want to, uh, ask you about. Uh, one of them was, I thought it was interesting when you said something about talent. I think a lot of people think that, oh, if you're talented at something. Then it shouldn't be work. 

00:16:35
Pat Love Ed. D. 

00:16:35
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Many of us never develop that talent. Because we only do what's easy. And I think, also if you has a several obvious talents, it's easy to go with it. I once heard years ago a presenter say this line. And, and, uh, I think it was Richard Bandler, or Grinder, his partner. One of them. But anyway, they said when I was studying in LP. And they said, there's some point in time when you shouldn't be satisfied with success. And I thought, what does that mean, you know? But I, but I remembered it. I didn't quite understand it, didn't relate to it. And, but I, I think that's what this means. Just because you're good at it, doesn't mean you ought to do it. Just because it's, maybe it does. But maybe it's also that what, what, what your talent needs is that honing, and that shaping, and that work. Which is, you know, movement and effort. And so I think you're, you're really on to something. 

00:17:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Well, you know, it interesting. 'Cuz I think of, you know, in the Chicago land area. When Michael Jordan was huge. And, you know, people think, oh, well, he was so talented. But that man also really worked . . . 

00:17:40
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes, yes. 

00:17:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. . . . at honing his talent. 

00:17:40
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes. 

00:17:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. You know, he probably practiced, you know, hours and hours everyday . . . 

00:17:45
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes. 

00:17:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. . . . for, you know, many, many, many years. 

00:17:45
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes. 

00:17:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Um, and he had a natural talent. 

00:17:50
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Mm-hmm. 

00:17:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. But it didn't mean it didn't take hard work. 

00:17:50
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yeah, good point. Yeah. 

00:17:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. And there's also, I forget his name. The, um, about flow. 

00:17:55
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Oh. 

00:17:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Uh, I, I f-, I can't say his last name. 

00:18:00
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. (inaudible ) 

00:18:01
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Now that was delightful that you said that. Can't do it, but . . . 

00:18:05
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Oh, well, that's just my version of his name. 

00:18:05
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. But, yeah, he used to talk about the things that, you know . . . 

00:18:10
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes. 

00:18:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. . . . you're really interested in. That you're talented at. That, um, that you get this natural flow. And, and that you lose track of time, because . . . 

00:18:20
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes. 

00:18:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. . . . it's something that you . . . 

00:18:20
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes. 

00:18:20
Shannon Dermer, Ph. D. 

00:18:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. . . . while you're working at it. That you also lose yourself. 

00:18:20
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. You're, you're, you're bring up a really, uh, thing I love. You know, I love list. So if you want to know w-, where your passion lies, answer these questions. What is it that when you we-, anti-, that you anticipate? When you wake up in the morning. And you know you're gonna do it. You, you look forward to it, okay. So anticipation. Number two, it's challenging. I-, it's not just easy. But it, it, it's stretches you so-, in some way. And number three, it, it gives you energy. It gives you energy. And i-, at the end you might be like, you know, physically tired. but you're, but you're charge. You know? And number four, when you're doing it. You lose track of time. I mean, it's absorbing. And number five, that it's congruent. That when you're doing it, you have this sense, yes, this is what I like doing. 

00:19:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Mm-hmm. 

00:19:10
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. And if you can meet those five criteria. Then you might be on to your passion, or your talent. And, and, right, because being in that flow, in the moment where you truly lose track of time is, it's, it's, it's fabulous. You're right. 

00:19:25
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Yeah. 

00:19:25
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yeah. 

00:19:25
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. 

00:19:25
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes. 

00:19:25
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Or d-, like . . . 

00:19:25
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes. 

00:19:25
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. . . . I'm sure you feel that when you're doing one of these presentations. And, um, but I did want to make sure to leave some time. I also wanted to talk about, you were talking about values. 

00:19:40
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes. 

00:19:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Uh, which is related to, you know, finding meaning in life and all that. 

00:19:40
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Mm-hmm. 

00:19:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. But, um, what do you do when, um, you find that people's stated values . . . 

00:19:50
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Uh-huh. 

00:19:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. . . . don't really match how their acting? And, like, or maybe what their true values are. 

00:19:55
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yeah, yeah. 

00:19:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. It may be what they want to be. But it's not really what they . . . 

00:20:00
Pat Love Ph. D. 

00:20:00
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yeah, yeah. So if a client would come in, let's say, for example. And, and they would say, well, here, here are my core values. You know? Well, first of all, every client I start the very same way. I just say, how can I help? 'Cuz I, I so believe that they're, they're guiding this. You know? A-, and by the way that, you know. 'Cuz outcome research says, for it to be positive from the client's point of view. The client has to believe I understand her/him, you know, and, and the issues. The client has to think I'm smart. And my treatment, somehow, makes sense. So I would say, well, tell me who you are. You know? And how does that line up? And, and, and of course this is where feelings are really important. Because guilt happens when you're belief and your behavior doesn't line up. So I might say, you know, I just might, so what do I do i-, when, when someone's behavior doesn't line up? Now if it's a friend. And they say they're a friend. But they don't, you know, act in that. Well, then I have a decision to make. 

00:21:00
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Right. 

00:21:00
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. 'Cuz I don't think a roll of a friend is made to be their therapist. You know? So, but if a client, I would say, well, what would it take, 'cuz what you do, if y-, if you say, this is your value. But yet your behavior's here. You got three options. You can change your behavior to be congruent. Get rid of that dissonance. Or you can change your belief. 

00:21:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Right. 

00:21:20
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Get it in line with your behavior. Or you can go on feeling guilty, and dissonant, and anxious. 

00:21:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Mm-hmm. 

00:21:30
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. So you've got three choices. I guess that's what I would do. Is just, you know, maybe present with the choices. I don't know. 

00:21:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. No, that's great. And a different talk you talked about happiness is really your expectation matching more, being congruent . . . 

00:21:40
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes. 

00:21:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. . . . with what you get in life. And now you're talking about your values being . . . 

00:21:45
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes. 

00:21:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. . . . dissonant. 

00:21:45
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yeah. 

00:21:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Uh . . . 

00:21:45
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yeah, you're, you . . . 

00:21:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Talk a little bit more about that. 

00:21:45
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. You've been paying attention. You've really been paying at-, I think that's probably projection. I never me-, I, I wouldn't have noticed that. Because I, I think it's, part of that is personal. My personal stuff coming out. Because I think, first of all, I knew I was depressed long before I new I was ever was anxious. I mean, other people knew I was anxious. I didn't, before I learned that it was a flip side of the same coin. And yet when I, when I, and, but I, first time of therapist ever said to me, 'Are you anxious?' I, I lied, and then went home and thought about it. I said, no, no, I, no. Me? Uh-huh, no. You know? But here's why I, I didn't, and, and this is a long answer for, you know, what you asked. But I think the reason why I didn't recognize the anxiety. Is because as far back as I remember I could never remember not being anxious. It was like the oxygen I breathed. And, and I think part of it had to do with family of origin. But also for, for the first sort a first half of my adulthood, in a way, I was living someone else's life. 

00:22:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Mm-hmm. 

00:22:55
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. I mean, that creates such dissonance if you're not in line with who you are. Who you were designed to be. And I, and this is sounding really ephemeral. And I don't, it's really pragmatic. 

00:23:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Mm-hmm. 

00:23:10
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Being congruent with the person you want to be, and need to be, and the talents that you were given. And being congruent, you know, being consistent abut that. Being true to yourself. 

00:23:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Mm-hmm. 

00:23:20
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. And, and I know this, you know, so-, but it, it shows up in anxiety, or disco-, whatever you want to call it. Discomfort and stress. And then other people sense that in you. You know, that trip with the Dahlia Lama. It was so interesting after we were processing it y-, for the rest of our life, you know. 

00:23:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. You and John Carlton? 

00:23:45
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes, exactly. But one of the Buddhist said, he said, you know, I we went in. We sat down. And I thought to myself, well, this isn't that other worldly. Nobody's levitating, you know, and everything. And he said, then I looked at everyone's face. And they were radiant. And I think when we're in ther-, as therapist. When we're congruent, and we're attuned, and we're there. We, our clients, we see the best in them. And we see that talent. And it, and it reflex in us. And I think that's a really big part of our job. That, you now, we see the best in them. And in, that's why, you know, with you. You've had this happen. You have clients who say, I felt better when I heard your voice on the answering machine. You know? 

00:24:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Mm-hmm. 

00:24:40
Pat Love Ed. D. 

00:24:40
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Why is that? 'Cuz we are attuned. You know? We're, but we have to be congruent. We have to be that person. 

00:24:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Mm-hmm. 

00:24:45
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. And I think that, you know, that was really the big take away for me. It was like, wow. When you sit in the presents of someone who's atuned, and smart, and interested in you. In fact, you talk about engaging. You know what's the most enga-, somebody who's interested in you . . . 

00:25:05
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Mm-hmm. 

00:25:05
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. . . . and attuned. I mean, that, that is so powerful that we, we long for that. Because we, if we didn't have it as infants. We wouldn't, we wouldn't have survived. Somebody had to be interested. Somebody had to be tuned in. 

00:25:20
Shannon Dermer, Ph. D. 

00:25:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. And that, and that totally related back to that, one of your other points. Was, um, and really it's the attachment theory, and some other things. But being able to be attuned to someone else. But then also allowing them be . . . 

00:25:35
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes. 

00:25:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. . . . to be attuned to you. That it's this recessive, reciprocal thing. 

00:25:35
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yeah. 

00:25:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. For a truly intimate relationship. That I have to be able to be vulnerable with you. But I also have to allow you to be vulnerable with me. And then we're a-, we truly feel known. but then we also can hopefully recognize, as you said, the best in each other. 

00:25:50
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes, yes., yes. Which, by the way, research says, is a mark of positive outcome in therapy. Can you cast your client in heroic rolls? Can you see the best? Do you believe, for example, in post traumatic strength, as well as post traumatic stress? Meaning, do you really believe in the human ability to heal, and get better, and to move forward, and have a positive outcome? Can you see the best? 

00:26:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Yeah, I think probably one of the, of those very, um, big example of this is probably, like, Viktor Frankl. 

00:26:30
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Oh. 

00:26:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Who went through some of the most traumatic things that someone can go through. 

00:26:35
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes. 

00:26:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. You know, with the Holocaust, and things like that. 

00:26:35
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes. 

00:26:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. And yet we talk about all the life lessons he had learned. And how, you know, it made him appreciate life more, and people more, and relationships more. And, and he went on to do this wonderful teaching out of something that was horrible. 

00:26:50
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes. 

00:26:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. You know? And so you're saying, that we need to, uh, help our clients do that in some ways. To see the best in them. And the strength in them. 

00:26:55
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes. 

00:26:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. And to help them out of traumatic things to find strength. 

00:27:00
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes. 

00:27:00
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. In, in our, in our ev-, our everyday relationships, too. 

00:27:05
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yes, yes, yes. 

00:27:05
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. That's, I feel like we're doing that now. 

00:27:10
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Oh, good, good. 

00:27:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. I feel like, uh, no. I feel like, uh, that is something that probably a lot of supervisor, and trainers do not talk to their supervisees about, the councilors in training, the therapist in training is how to help, how to see the heroism in your clients. 

00:27:25
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. Yeah, it's funny. Uh, you mentioned just, you made me think. 'Cuz you said, vulnerability. You know? Uh, I was on this panel. We were, we were actually honored by Texas Association Marriage Family Therapy. And I was on this panel, you know. And, um, they said well, w-, what do you think people will remember about you? You know? And, and, and they were, you know, published and accomplished people sitting there. And, and, and I answered that, what I think will people will remember about me. And I said, I think what they'll remember are my stories. Like, for example, this is a true story. One time, 'cuz I'm always, you know, I was born a redhead. And I plan to die a redhead. And so I, you know, I color my hair. And it doesn't always, it's not as easy as it looks. I mean, it comes out different wild colors. And one time I was at a conference. And it was one of these wild colors. And I got on an air-, I got in an elevator. And a woman looked at me, and she said, 'You know? You look an awful like Pat Love.' 

00:28:25
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Look, I kind a am. 

00:28:25
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. And so I tell these stories. And then, but I, then I said, it's okay if they remember the stories. 'Cuz I think what they remember is my vulnerability. 

00:28:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. Y-, yes. 

00:28:35
DR. PAT LOVE PH. D. And I'm okay with th-, I'm okay with that. I'm okay with that. 

00:28:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER, PH. D. And I hate to cut you off, as you're being vulnerable on telling a story. Um, but I have to be heroic and, uh, wrap things up, or the director is going to hurt me.
