HOLLY KIBBE Hi, I'm Holly Kibbe. 

00:00:05
CHERISH TWIGG And I'm Cherish Twigg. What you're about to watch is the tacting DVD in our intensive teaching series. 

00:00:10
HOLLY KIBBE Tacting is basically an expressive label of items, actions, relations, events, properties, etcetera. When tacting, an operable stimulus is always present. Tacting is just a piece of the concept of reward. 

00:00:25
CHERISH TWIGG We tried to make this DVD in such a way that it could easily be understood by both parents and professionals. We've also made an effort to provide you with several ways to teach each objective. 

00:00:35
HOLLY KIBBE It is our sincere hope that you find these teaching procedures to be efficient and effective in teaching your children to tact. 

00:00:45

Tacting common objects, pictures and body parts 

00:00:55
HOLLY KIBBE Before you teach tacts to your learner, you want to make sure they can ask for a few things first. If we want our children to learn that communicating is fun, we'll have more success by starting in the manding or requesting repertoire. When you're ready to start teaching tacts, start with items they can already ask for and that they find valuable. In order for your learner's response to be a tact and not a mand, you need to remove the reinforcing value. This is why we frequently teach this skill using pictures first. A picture of cookies is not as valuable as the actual cookie in most cases. Next you'll want to teach them to tact more common items. These would be things that they come in contact with in their everyday environment on a frequent basis. It might be something like a bed, a car, their shoes, a chair, and things like that. When teaching this objective, sometimes we start with objects and other times we start with pictures. It completely depends upon your learner. Just make sure that what is taught in a picture can be tacted as an object as well. If it cannot, you will likely need to teach this too. After you learner has acquired several tacts of common items, you should also teach your learner to tact body parts. Continue to teach this objective until you feel that you've taught it to functionality. One teaching procedure we use to teach these objectives to vocal children is known as the echoic to tact transfer. Let me show this to you now.

00:03:40
HOLLY KIBBE For children that may be having a difficult time learning to tact items, but they're easily able to answer questions about those things when they're not present, we may use an intraverbal to tact transfer. Let's take a look at this one together.

00:04:25
Tacting Ongoing Actions 

00:04:50
CHERISH TWIGG Once your learner is able to tact some objects as well as some pictures, you be able to start teaching them to tact ongoing actions. An example of an ongoing action would be if I were to say, What's the bear doing? And the learner could say, Jumping. If I said to my learner, What am I doing? And they could say, Clapping, or waving, etcetera. Do not start teaching this with pictures first. A lot of people when they're teaching children with autism will 2D pictures of actions, of someone running or clapping. The problem is there is no action in a picture. And this can cause problems later on. For example, we one time worked with a little boy who loved attention. And in order to get attention, he would frequently tact things in his environment. Well, they had started to teach him to tact actions using picture cards. And one day, he walked up to his mother, took his bear and went, Mommy look, running. And held the bear's legs still and said, Mommy, look clapping and held the bear's arms out still. This told us that that had caused some serious problems and that he truly didn't know what running was. Running is actually running. And clapping is actually clapping. So when you're ready to teach this, make sure you use actual ongoing actions. You can teach this with you doing the action. You can have the child do the action and teach them to label themselves doing the action. You can have them tact actions on videos. You can have them tact actions of other children in the room or outside. Just make sure that you only teach actions that are functional for your learner. There are many ways that you can approach teaching this skill. The most common one is what we call an echoic to tact transfer. We use this for our children who are vocal and this is what it would look like.

CHERISH TWIGG Finally, sometimes we'll work with children who are not vocal. And in that case we will use sign language as their response form. So we would be teaching them to tact the action using a sign. Here's how we teach it.

Component to Composite Noun/Action 

00:07:55
CHERISH TWIGG Once you have a learner who is able to tact some objects as well as some actions, you might be ready to start teaching them what we would call component to composite tacting. This means you're going to take the component skills of tacting an object and an action and put them together to form a composite tact. For example, if my learner can tact a bear and they can tact jumping, now I would want them to say bear jumping when I ask them to do so with a specific demand. I would want to make sure I said something like tell me all about this. Describe what you see here? And then I would expect them to give me the noun and the action in the right order. Make sure when you're teaching this that you do not set specific targets, not just the bear jumping or the dog walking. Make sure that you combine all mastered objects with any mastered actions across lots of different stimuli. The main way that we teach this skill is as follows.

Tacting the Features of an Object 

00:09:30
HOLLY KIBBE Now you're ready to teach your child to tact the features on an object. An example would be if you held up an airplane. Your learner could tell you that this was a wing. To teach this objective, use objects they come in contact with on a frequent basis. Teach only what is functional for your learner. After you've chosen functional objects to teach, make sure the learner can tact the object by its actual name first. If your learner cannot tell you the name of the item, but you're teaching him to tact the features on that item, he may start to call the whole object by a feature name. So let's say we're going to teach our learner to tact the features on a car. They'll already be able to tact the car, and your target features might be the wheel, the door, and the windshield. The end product that you want is when you point to a feature on the car and you ask your learner what the name of that particular feature is, they'll be able to tell you. This is why when we teach this objective, we do not go in the same order every single time. If we do, the response can turn into sort of an intraverbal link, whereas if they're not telling you that this is the windshield first, they may not be able to then tell you that this is the door. To make sure that your learner doesn't lose the previously taught tact of the entire object, we make sure that we frequently ask the learner to tact the object by its name throughout a teaching session. There are several ways to teach this objective. The most common way is the echoic to tact transfer. Let us demonstrate this for you.

00:12:25
Tacting Adjectives 

00:12:40
CHERISH TWIGG Next we're going to talk about teaching your child to tact adjectives. But before you start teaching them to label the adjectives or the properties of something, you need to make sure they have a pretty strong tacting repertoire. They should be able to label at least 75 to 100 objects. And they should be learning them pretty readily, anywhere from at least three to four per week. We found that when we try to teach properties or adjectives before we have this criterion, we don't get very far. An example of an adjective would be the size of something, big versus little, or rough versus smooth, full versus empty, heavy, light, etcetera. Now you can imagine if your child has a difficult time telling you that this is a bear, it's going to be very difficult for them to also tell you that it's brown. So keep that in mind. You want to make sure they have a strong tacting repertoire before you go into teaching adjectives. When we're ready to start teaching this, we recommend that you teach at least two sets of attributes at a time. One set, for example, would be big and little. We wouldn't teach big in the absence of little. They're both going to be running at the same time. That would be one set. We might also be teaching full and empty at the same time. This helps teach a discrimination from the very beginning. 

00:13:50
Step 1 

00:13:50
CHERISH TWIGG When you're teaching your two sets of adjectives, perhaps like we said, it's big and little, and full and empty. For big and little we want to have at least four to six sets of stimuli that are identical except for one's big and one's little. For example, here are our bears. They're both brown. They're both bears. One's big and one's little. The same thing for full and empty. We want to have identical stimuli except that one's full and one's empty. Make sure that whatever stimuli you're using to teach full and empty looks nothing like the stimuli you're using to teach big and little. For example, if you're using a full cup and an empty cup, you wouldn't also want to be teaching using a big cup and a little cup. Not doing that will help promote discrimination early on. Also, when you're teaching this make sure that you're moving your stimuli around. That big isn't always on this side and little isn't always on this side. They may not actually be looking at the difference in size. They're just learning that the big one's always over here. Also, don't do big, then little, then big, then little. They could do that with their eyes closed. They don't have to actually look at the stimuli to be correct. Now, there are several ways that we can teach this skill. And ones that they're mastered, we want to make sure that we go away from using identical sets of stimuli. I'll show you those steps after these demonstrations.

Sign/Mimetic to Tact 

00:16:10
CHERISH TWIGG Let's talk about size. What size? Little. Little. What size? Little. What size? Big. Big. What size? Big. You'll want to use one of the previous teaching procedures, whichever one's most effective for your child, and keep teaching that way until all of your sets of stimuli are mastered. For example, I would want to make sure my dragons were mastered, my bears were mastered, my fish were mastered. At that point I'm ready to move on to the next step. 

00:16:45
Step 2 

00:16:45
CHERISH TWIGG The next step might be to pull up two stimuli that I've never used to teach size before, but they're still identical, and see if my learner can generalize to novel identical stimuli. If I just did my bears and I just did my dragons, can I now bring up these cute leprechauns and say, What size? What size? And can my learner generalize? 

00:17:00
Step 3 

00:17:05
CHERISH TWIGG If they can do this, the next thing that you might want to try is to take one of your objects that was mastered as big, put it next to one of the objects that was mastered as little, but now they're not identical, and see if your learner, if you say what size, can they respond? 

00:17:20
Step 4 

00:17:20
CHERISH TWIGG Another thing you can do right now is to lay out all of the mastered sets of stimuli and kind of bounce around and see if your learner can tact them in a large field. 

00:17:30
Step 5 

00:17:30
CHERISH TWIGG The next step might be to take something that was used to teach size and was always big, bring up something that's small that was never used to teach size. So now I've got my bear that was always big, and I've got this plane next to it that's smaller. It's not identical. You can see how I'm fading away from always having to use identical stimuli. You want to do this and combine all of your mastered sets with lots of novel of the opposite adjective until this is really strong. 

00:17:55
Step 6 

00:17:55
CHERISH TWIGG The next step might be to take two completely novel objects that are not identical and you've never used them to teach size and bring them out and ask your learner, What size? What size? And see if they can respond. If they can do this, you are almost there but not quite. There might be one last thing that you can do. 

00:18:15
Step 7 

00:18:20
CHERISH TWIGG Remember this bear that was always tacted as big when you asked what size? Can you now put this bear out next to something that's even bigger, like this porcupine, and say, Hey, what size? Can they call this bear little in the presence of something that's actually bigger? If they can do this, then you know that they're truly getting the concept of big and little.

CHERISH TWIGG Once you have a learner who is able to tact some adjectives as well as some objects, you can do another type of component to composite tact where now you're combining the adjective with the noun. So if my learner can tell me red when I say what color, and they can tell me dragon when I say, what is it, I now would like to be able to ask them, tell me all about this, and for them to be able to say red dragon.

Component to Composite Adjective/Noun/Action 

00:20:00
CHERISH TWIGG When teaching a component to composite tacting to our learners, our ultimate goal is for them to be able to put all of the possible components into one composite tact. For example, I would ultimately want my learner to be able to tell me I see a red dragon walking on the table if I said to them, Tell me all about what you see here. But to get there, we're going to slowly build using their mastered skills. At this point, we have a learner who knows how to say red dragon when I say, tell me all about this. And they can also put the noun and the action together and say dragon jumping when I say, tell me all about this. All we have to do now is combine those two. Here's how we do it.

Tacting Environmental Sounds 

00:21:05
HOLLY KIBBE Now you're ready to teach your learner to tact environmental sounds. Your learner must have a strong tact repertoire before you teach this objective. When you're ready to select targets to teach, choose only those sounds that your child hears in their everyday environment on a frequent basis. It can be sounds such as your cell phone ringing, maybe Daddy's car pulling into the driveway. If they like trains or if you leave near a train, you might teach them to tact the sound of the train's engine or its horn blowing when they don't actually see it. Avoid teaching sounds that aren't particularly functional for your learner. In this instance, the nonverbal stimulus we're interested in is the sound and not the actual object itself. This is why we don't want the learner to have to see the object to be able to tact the sound. When choosing stimuli to use to teach your targets, you might wish to capture the target sounds on a digital tape recorder so that you can have them at your disposal at any time. This may also help you to avoid teaching the targets in the same order every time. As with many objectives if you teach the targets in the same order all the time, the learner could become dependent upon the order to be able to respond correctly. This is why we avoid using pre-made audio tapes when we teach this skill. Unless we're able to mix up the order when we teach with them. Continue to teach your learner until you've taught what is functional for them. The most common way to teach this objective is using the echoic to tact transfer procedure. This is for a vocal child and the procedure looks like this.

00:24:10
Tacting Yes &amp; No 

00:24:20
HOLLY KIBBE Now let's talk about teaching your learner to tact yes and no. A lot of times when teaching in this field, people come to us and say, my learner knows yes and no. This does not give us enough information. Are they talking about yes and no as a mand? Yes and no as a tact? Or yes and no as an intraverbal? Because you can have yes and no across all of those different functions. An example of yes and no as a mand might be if you showed your learner this bear, and you said to your learner, Do you want the bear? Their response of yes or no is short for yes, I want the bear or no, I don't want the bear. An example of yes and no as an intraverbal might be if you asked a question about the bear when it wasn't present, such as Do you like to play with bears? And your learner would respond yes or no accordingly. An example of yes and no as a tact is, is this a bear? And your learner would respond yes or no, depending upon whether or not it was a bear. This is the one we're going to talk about right now. To teach this skill, it's even more important to make sure your child has a strong tacting repertoire. This objective is actually harder than your average tact. It's a secondary verbal operant, and we won't go into a lot of detail on it here. But you just need to know that if your learner is not learning this skill, you may need to go back and strengthen their tacting repertoire before teaching this. When you are teaching this, choose pictures that are very, very strong tacts. These must be things that your child can tact readily and fluently. You will have two targets for this program. The targets are yes and no. You want to rotate through the strong tacts when asking the questions, but don't set targets with the actual picture cards. You aren't going to just teach your child to answer yes and no questions about a ball. You're going to ask them to tact yes and no across anything that they're able to tact so that this skill will actually generalize. When teaching this objective, any time the response is no, follow the teaching trial by asking the learner to tact the item name. For example, I hold up the picture of this ball and I say to my learner, is this a shoe? My learner responds, no. Following this, I would immediately ask, what is it? My learner should then respond by labeling the item name. What tends to start happening when you do this is your child will start to respond by saying no, it's a ball or no, it's a bird. And then telling you what the actual name is. This sounds very natural in most cases. When teaching your targets, mix up the order you use to teach and embed these trials between some trials of tacting by item name so that following a teaching trial, you'll ask your learner, what is it to several pictures. Here's an example. What is it? They say ball. What's this one? They say bird. Is this a boat? Yes. They say yes, and then so on and so forth. If you never do this, you may lose the tact of the item name and they might start responding by saying yes when you ask them what something is called. Another thing you need to think about is making sure you watch your intonation when teaching this objective. A lot of times when we teach this objective, we might say to our learner, when the answer's supposed to be no, is this a shoe? And the learner will know to respond no only because of the way you said it and not because this is a strong skill. The main way we teach this skill is using an echoic to tact transfer. This is for our children that are vocal and they can echo what we say. It looks like this.

Tacting Missing Features 

00:29:10
CHERISH TWIGG The next thing we want to teach to our learner is to tact features of objects that are missing. For example, if I hold up this plane and the wing is missing and I say, Hey, what's missing? Can they say, Wing? Make sure when you're teaching this skill that you're only teaching them to tact features that are missing if they can tact the feature when it's there. When teaching tacts of missing features, we recommend that you use objects rather than pictures in the beginning because this way the feature that's missing is more obvious. We usually have two objects to teach this, one object with all the features present and one object with one of those features missing. First present the item where all the features are there, have them tact each feature individually, ending on the one that's going to be missing on the second item. Then present the item where one is missing and say, What's missing? Be sure when you're teaching tacts of missing features that your learner is able to tact all the features that they know when they're missing. Here's how we do it.

Tacting Negation 

00:30:50
CHERISH TWIGG Now we want to talk about teaching our learner to tact negation, or you could also say tacting the one that doesn't belong or tell me the odd one out. In our example here, I would want my learner to be able to tell me which one of these three things is not a bear if I asked them to do so. Before we start teaching this skill, our learner should be able to tact many objects and we actually use the mastered skill of tacting yes and no as our prompt for this procedure. So I would say to my learner, Is this a bear? They would say yes. Is this a bear? They would say yes. Then I would point to the one that's not a bear and say, Is this a bear? They should be able to say no, it's a plane. Then I could present my demand again and say, Which one doesn't belong? And they would say airplane again. When teaching, you always want to end on a no and make sure that the no is always in a different location. Also, you want to make sure you ask your questions in different ways. Sometimes you might say, Which one doesn't belong. Other times I might specifically say, Tell me the one that's not a bear. You also want to teach this skill across features, functions and class. So I might ask my learner, Which one of these is not an animal? And they should also be able to tell me airplane at that time. Here's how we teach this skill.

00:32:40
Tacting Prepositions. 

00:32:55
HOLLY KIBBE Now we're going to talk about teaching your learner to tact prepositions. In our field, people tend to teach this objective way too soon. There are certain prerequisites that we found necessary to learn this skill. Your learner is most likely to be successful with this objective if they've already learned at least 75 tacts of common items at a pretty quick rate, of at least three per week. And they've learned a majority of the tacting objectives already discussed on the DVD prior to this one. Your learner should also have a good length of utterance within their responses. Whether it be a vocal response or a sign response. If your learner cannot echo at least three word phrases, we do not recommend teaching this skill. We don't want to allow our learner to give us just a one-word response at this point in time. The reason why is because when our learner responds with a one-word response, we don't get enough information about the relationship that we're tacting. Let me show you an example. If I hold up a ball and a cow and I say to my learner, Where's the cow? My learner could respond with a variety of answers that would all likely be correct. They could say over, and they'd be right because it's over the ball. They could say under, and they'd be right because it's under the ceiling. They could say in front of, and they'd be right. It's in front of me. There's a variety of things that they could say. So when you're teaching this objective, require your learner to attach the noun to the sentence. You want them to say, over the ball, so that you know exactly which relationship that they're tacting. When you start to teach this objective, we usually teach two sets of prepositions at a time. For each set of prepositions that we're teaching, we use several pairs of stimuli to teach them. I might use, maybe, a bear and a leprechaun for one pair of stimuli to teach this skill. I may then also use a dragon and a turtle for another pair of stimuli to teach this objective. Then I'm going to go on and pick anywhere from three to six pairs of stimuli for that particular set. If you're teaching more than one set of prepositions at a time, try not to cross your stimuli in the beginning. If you can avoid this, it will be likely that your learner will learn it at a faster rate. Once the learner's mastered all the pairs of stimuli within the set of prepositions that you're teaching, you can then cross your stimuli. When teaching this objective, there's several steps to follow that may help your child to acquire and to generalize the skill at a faster rate. 

00:35:25
Step 1 

00:35:25
HOLLY KIBBE The first step is to choose your individual pairs of stimuli and within these pairs, choose one item that will stay stationary and the other one that will be mobile. Here's an example. We have over the bear and under the bear. The bear will be stationary and the ball will be the thing that moves around. This way, the learner's response is always over the bear or under the bear, whereas the part of the bear stays constant. This may help the learner learn it faster as it almost gives them less to think about while learning the skill. After they've mastered all of the individual pairs of stimuli that you taught within step 1, now you can move to step 2. 

00:36:10
Step 2 

00:36:10
HOLLY KIBBE With step 2, you're taking novel stimuli that they can tact very, very well, and you're testing to see if they can generalize the skill without any prior teaching. If they cannot, go back to step 1, set new target pairs of stimuli until you can then return to step 2 again. Once they respond to novel pairs of stimuli, you'll be able to start step 3. 

00:36:35
Step 3 

00:36:35
HOLLY KIBBE At this point in time, you'll come back to your original sets that you previously taught within step 1. Before, we had always put the ball over and under the bear. But now, we'll begin to keep the ball stationary, and we'll move the bear over and under the ball. And then we'll see if our learner can now respond. You'll want to continue to teach this objective until you taught what is functional for your learner. We would likely teach at least five sets of prepositions, but possibly more for a child who's ready for this. The most common teaching procedure we use to teach this objective to a vocal learner is known as the echoic to tact transfer. Let me show this to you now.

Carrier Phrases 

00:41:55
HOLLY KIBBE Now let's talk about teaching your learner to tact using carrier phrases. An example of a tact with a carrier phrase would be if your learner said, I see a ball rather than just ball. Or another example might be, it's a ball or there's a ball or that's a ball. These are all examples of tacting using carrier phrases. Now, there's also manding with carrier phrases. Examples of these are, can I have the ball? Give me the ball. I want the ball. Kick the ball, and things like that. If you're going to teach your learner to start in the very beginning talking with longer utterances, we recommend you do that within the mand repertoire. So we will probably start by teaching them to mand with carrier phrases because once in the mand, the learner gets reinforced right away. If we're going to make them say more and talk in longer phrases, we have more success within the mand repertoire where it gets reinforced immediately. Once they're readily manding using carrier phrases, then we're ready to go ahead and start thinking about tacting with carrier phrases, as long as their tacting repertoire is nice and strong. If it is, then we would go ahead and start teaching with at least two different phrases. So we might teach, I see a-, and whatever the noun is. And we might teach, it's a-, and whatever the noun is. Because if we just taught one, if we taught everything with, I see a-, I see a-, then we went to teach more phrases we would be fighting against the child's inclination to say I see a-. And it would be more difficult. So we always teach with at least two examples in the beginning. Now the reason we even teach tacting with carrier phrases is so that when our learner tacts spontaneously, they will use them. Typically developing kids do this all the time. You see three and four year olds say, There's a butterfly. I see an airplane. There's a frog. And these are all examples of spontaneously using carrier phrases within a tact. But these are actually mands for attention. What we want is that when our learner starts to mand for attention using spontaneous tacts, we want them to be able to use their, it's a-, that's a-, there's a-, and all those different phrases there. This is why we teach it. The most common way to teach this to our vocal learners is to use an echoic to tact transfer. Let's take a look at this one. 

00:44:00
Echoic to Tact 

00:44:05
HOLLY KIBBE What do you see? I see a ball. 

00:44:10
CHERISH TWIGG I see a ball. 

00:44:10
HOLLY KIBBE What do you see? 

00:44:10
CHERISH TWIGG I see a ball. 

00:44:10
HOLLY KIBBE One thing that you may need to add to the previous demonstration is a partial vocal or phonemic prompt on the transfer trial. This may be necessary to prevent the learner from saying just the item name on the transfer. This partial prompt must also be faded. Let me show you what this might look like. I may say to my learner, What do you see? And prompt, I see a book. They would respond, I see a book. On my transfer trial, I'd say, What do you see? I-, to prompt them to go ahead and say I see a book. With some children it's actually better to use a text prompt because they like reading and taking text prompts may be more effective or more efficient for them to learn it. So in that case, you would use the written word to facilitate their response. It would look like this.

Tacting Component to Composite with Carrier Phrases 

00:45:20
CHERISH TWIGG The only piece we haven't talked about adding to our composite tact is the carrier phrase. However, the definition of knowing your carrier phrases is that the child will use them spontaneously when they tact. So if they have those they're going to add them naturally. I also want to make one point. When your children are using these composite tacts and tacting out in the everyday environment, they don't have to put every component in every single time. If they do, it starts to look a little bit strange. So you want to make sure that they're using at least some of those components throughout a nice mix. If you find that they're leaving off one component consistently, here's how you can fix it.

Tacting Function 

00:46:30
HOLLY KIBBE Now we're going to teach your learner to tact the function of an item. For this objective you would want to be able to ask your child what they do with a particular item. And you'd want them to respond by telling you the function. Here's an example. I may show them this ball. I would not say the word ball but I would say to my learner, What do you do with this? The end product that I want is for my learner to respond, You throw it. If my learner can already answer some questions without the item present and can already answer the question, What do you do with a ball? I could use that skill to teach this particular objective. Here's what it would look like. 

00:47:05

HOLLY KIBBE Another procedure you could use if your child could not answer the questions without the item present would be a text to tact transfer. This would be for children who can read and who find reading fun. Let me show this to you now.

Tacting Pronouns 

00:49:20
HOLLY KIBBE Now we're ready to teach the learner to tact pronouns. At this point in time, your child has a strong tacting repertoire and can easily tact all of the other things we've talked about previously on this DVD. It's important to note that when you teach your learner to tact pronouns, we do not teach the receptive and the tact component of this objective at the same time. If we do, it will likely turn into an Abbott and Costello skit. For example, if you were to say to the learner, Touch my elbow. Your learner would likely walk over to you, and go like this. Now if you immediately said, Whose elbow? Your learner is likely to say, My elbow, which is the incorrect answer. When you're teaching this, you want to make sure you prompt your learner from their perspective and not from your own personal perspective. Now, often times, in addition to the procedures I'm about to show you, you may have to add some additional teaching across other skill areas in order for your child to learn this objective. At the same time you teach tacts of pronouns, you might need to teach your learner to mand with pronouns, which would mean that they're asking for things using pronouns from their personal perspective in the everyday and natural environment all the time. Another thing you might have to do is prompt your child in the everyday environment to tell you things they're doing but from their own perspective. So you might say to your learner, What are you doing? And prompt them to say, I'm playing. So that often times, they hear you say the pronoun from your perspective followed by a response from them from their perspective using the same pronoun. When we teach this skill, we typically follow an order in teaching. The first set that we might teach is I and you. Take a look at this set across the various different teaching procedures. 

00:51:10
Pronouns I/You 1. Echoic to tact Followed by 2. Text to tact

00:51:30
CHERISH TWIGG I do. 

00:51:30
HOLLY KIBBE We'll usually follow those by teaching my and your. When we're teaching our learner to tact my and your, we typically do so by tacting something on our own body. You wouldn't want to pick up your child's shoe and then ask them to tell you whose shoe it is. We're not talking about possessions here. Here's an example of this set of pronouns across various teaching procedures. 

00:51:55

HOLLY KIBBE Whose hand? 

00:52:15
CHERISH TWIGG My hand. 

00:52:20
HOLLY KIBBE The next one we usually teach is he and she. When teaching he and she, we do not want to use the picture to teach this particular objective. We use honest to goodness live people, bring in a real boy and a real girl and run your teaching procedure with real live people first. You can generalize to pictures after this but it's best if you start with the actual 3D people. Take a look at these targets across a few different teaching procedures.

00:53:10
HOLLY KIBBE After he and she, you may want to teach your child to tact his and her. After this, maybe we and they. Continue to teach pronouns to your child until you feel you've taught all that are functional for that learner. After we take a look at these, we're going to come back and I'll show you some examples of what to avoid doing when teaching. Now we can take a look.

00:54:20
HOLLY KIBBE When you are teaching this objective, there are several things you want to avoid doing. The first of these is that you want to avoid praising your learner from your own personal perspective. For example, if I was to say to my learner, Who has the turtle? And she was to respond by saying, I do, I wouldn't want to say, Great, you do have the turtle and praise her by calling her you. The reason why is because at this point in time, your learner has a very strong tacting repertoire, and they're probably going to start learning some things just from their own environment and the way they hear them said. So if you give praise from your own personal perspective, and then you pair this praise with reinforcement, they may unlearn the response that you previously taught them. This could result in the child re-learning the target the wrong way. Another thing to avoid doing during a teaching trial is using pronouns from your perspective to ask for the stimuli back. Let me show you what this would look like. Who has the bear? 

00:55:20
CHERISH TWIGG I do. 

00:55:20
HOLLY KIBBE Can I have the bear? Now who has the bear? If you do this, you're likely to get an incorrect response from your learner. Instead of asking for the stimuli back, try just reaching over and taking it without talking, unless you can think of another way to ask for it without using a pronoun.

Tacting Pronouns: Echoic to Tact Text to Tact 

00:55:45
Tacting Adverbs 

00:56:00
CHERISH TWIGG One advanced tact is what we call tacting adverbs. Make sure before you start teaching your learner to tact adverbs that they can tact lots of objects, actions, prepositional relations, pronouns, etcetera before you go here. It's a very difficult tact for our learners to acquire. We recommend teaching this skill in the natural environment and capture real live opportunities. For example, if you hear some people talking very loud, do your transfer trial right there. If you see someone carrying something and they're doing it very carefully, use that as a good teaching opportunity. For our vocal children, we usually just do what we call an echoic to tact transfer that looks like this. 

00:56:35

CHERISH TWIGG Finally, for those children that we work with that are not vocal, we teach them using sign language. So for them, the teaching procedure would be a sign or mimetic to tact transfer and it looks like this. 

00:57:25

Tacting the Emotions of Others 

00:58:00
HOLLY KIBBE Now let's talk about tacting emotions. You can teach your learner to tact the emotions of other people, or you can teach them to tact emotions of their own. Now, if you're teaching your child to tact the emotions of other people, you're going to have to find opportunities in real life, where people are clearly either happy or angry or sad, and use these as opportunities to implement some transfer trials and teach it. If you're teaching your learner to tact their own emotions, you're also going to have to capture opportunities where they're clearly feeling a certain way and then implement the teaching procedure right there. There are different ways to teach this. An example of tacting emotions on others using an echoic to tact transfer procedure would look like this. 

00:58:40
Echoic to Tact 

00:58:45
CHERISH TWIGG How does he feel? Happy. 

00:58:50
HOLLY KIBBE Happy. 

00:58:50
CHERISH TWIGG How does he feel?
