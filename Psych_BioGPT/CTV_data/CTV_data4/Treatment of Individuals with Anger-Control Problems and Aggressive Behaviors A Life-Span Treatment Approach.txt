DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay, good morning and welcome, ah, to the morning presentation. Ah, to begin with I'm curious how many people are present here today who was not here yesterday at the PTSD workshop? You miss one hell of a presentation. You really did. Ah, I love these all new virgins, it's good. Uhm, ah, so, ah, with the indulgence of people who are here yesterday, ah, let me just take a moment at the outset to, ah, share with you, ah, the backdrop to this presentation on anger and aggressive behavior, uhm, from a lifespan perspective. Uhm, as I noted yesterday, I'm a clinical psychologist and taught for, ah, some 35 years at the university of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. I took early retirement and like many Canadians, I now spend, ah, winters in Florida and, ah, part of what takes me to Florida, as I noted yesterday, is not only the avoidance of the winter but I am the research director of a thing called the Melissa Institute for violence prevention and treatment of victims of violence. Uhm, Melissa was a young lady who grew up in Miami, Florida and she was going to school as an undergraduate at Washington University and a, ah, a tragic occurrence was that she got carjacked and brutally murdered. And as I noted yesterday, when such a tragedy like that befalls an individual, their family, their friends, relatives, and the community at large, one of the ways people cope is to and transform their pain so they could do some good. And so the, the notion is some 17 years ago, co-- we created an institute that would be effective in reducing, ah, level of violence. I have, ah, seven grandchildren and I'm now at, ah, generativity phase of life to see if in the-- my latter years we could do anything to make the world a bit safer. So part of the, uhm, mission of the Melissa Institute, it's a-- it's not a direct hands-on institute in providing direct services apropos of this presentation. It's designed to give science a way. So, we have an annual conference each year and, ah, the first Friday in May in Miami and, ah, all of the materials that are put together for that conference as well as other materials are, ah, available to you online for free. And, ah, you will see, ah, in the handout for the Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference, I have, ah, put, ah, a 357-page handout available, ah, in case you have nothing to do, ah, for each of these seven presentations that I'm involved in. Ah, the, ah, website for the Melissa Institute is merely www and then the word Melissa Institute, all one word, dot org. So it's m-e-l-i-s-s-ainstitute.org. I am very, very proud to say that this year alone, the Melissa Institute has had 2 million hits worldwide so we are in the-- yeah, I know. Ah, it's really good. Not only that, it-- it's more than that. There's a sister website called TeachSafeSchools that is all focused in on issues of addressing bullying, cyber bullying, uhm, ah, I'll tell you more about that as we go along. Ah, one of the things that we're going to talk about is how do you make a violent youth. It's kind of interesting. How, how do you think someone gets from the point of being born to the point of killing Melissa? Or the person who apropos of this week's anniversary goes in to a public school in Newtown and kills all those children? Cuz it's in the annual report on which we celebrated the anniversary of putting on, ah, a picture of the bus at, at Newtown. Not only that, one of the things you're going to see that I encourage you to look at is in that developmental trajectory. It turns out that if you can get kids to read by grade three, reading comprehension, you reduce the likelihood of violence substantially specially for early starters. Uh-huh. You could leave those lights up a bit until we get to the movies. Yeah. Uhm, so if you go to the Melissa Institute you will be able to download for free 300 movies-- yeah, that's perfect-- 300 movies of how to teach children to read early on. In fact, one of the interesting statistics is that people who are in the business of building prison cells look at the failure rate of reading comprehension by grade three and predict the number of prison cells you need for adult hood. So, it's-- as you'll see, it's not just reading, it's that reading puts on a certain kind of trajectory so you will be able to go on and see teachers in Toronto, Mississippi, Florida, and the like teaching high-risk kids those skills. We're gonna talk about what are skills they need as well. Uhm, so, ah, one of the, ah, things that I encourage you to do is, ah, to, ah, visit the Melissa Institute website and its sister website as a supplement to this presentation. You will also be able to go to the home page on the Melissa Institute website and on the left is the thing called author index, you could scroll down and, ah, click on Meichenbaum and see many other opportunities on issues of adolescent suicide, ah, how do you make a violent youth, differs for boys versus girls, you could see all the work that we've done on cyber bullying. Ah, for instance, on the bullying piece, we have, ah, included there i-- if your child is a victim of a violence, uhm, by bullying and so forth, we've included a letter that you the parent can download that you can then send to the principal. And so, we'd like to address these issues in the coming-- not only that. We've included on there for principals and superintendents who are so critical in this area. Ah, if you get sued by the parent and you're taken to court, we've now included the letter-- the questions that the lawyer will cross-examine you on. We've now targeted 114,000 principals in this-- United States, uhm, in order to, ah, look at, ah, ah, them being the critical pivotal person to improve safety in the schools. So, ah, the, the, the site has really reached not only from my perspective-- oh-oh! Here's the most important one, okay, given the-- as I look this audience. I have four children, you're gonna hear about them. Over the years, they brought home prospective partners. One in two marriages in the United States fail. Of those that failed do the divorce, you have up to 30% where there's domestic violence. I don't know if you ever saw the movie Meeting the Parents with De Niro, okay. So, this is meeting the parent when the parent is Don Meichenbaum. No, this is very important, okay. There are a lot of young women here. Okay, this is really, really important. So, you'll be able go online and see all the factors of what to predict and I'll talk more about this. So, there's a measure called predicting the violence prete-- potential of prospective partners, okay, the VPP. And, uhm, we're gonna see, you know, I'm gonna show you people who have problems with violence all the way through and, uhm, and one of the things that will be important as we get to it is, ah, before, you know, before you go on, you know, one of these, ah, websites to date someone, first of all, you wanna get their name and Google them whether they have a prison record, okay. But beyond that, you wanna know what are the factors to look out for, okay. So, smart women don't end up with-- and this is not only-- it-- we'll see that it's bidirectional, ah, in terms of what women contributing to the violence as much as men. Okay, so that's all by background for the people of what they missed yesterday. I will also note that there are two books on, ah, that, ah, I, ah, have, ah, published that are available. One is, ah, a book on all the work I talked about yesterday with returning soldiers, trauma families, and the like and that's called Roadmap to Resilience. Ah, you could actually go in and go to appendix B and see all the kind of factors that undermine resilience. One of which we'll see is anger and the other is a clinical handbook on anger control, ah, that has a lot of useful information about how to take an adolescent who's angry and aggressive, turning him into a social problem solver, how to get-- go-- gone away from psychiatric patients who are violent and the like and I have more to say about that. Most important information, if there are any questions that come up following this presentation that you would like to consult with me, my email address is dhmeich@aol.com, dhmeich@aol.com. Okay, some of the people who came in actually received a, ah, a postcard, ah, for those 500 or so who came in. Ah, we-- and, and who have missed yesterday, I just recently did a thing for PESI where we did a one-hour interview on, ah, trauma and resilience and you can go online and see the information and on the back is the, ah, ah, websites for the, ah, roadmap to resilience and the Melissa Institute. The topic at hand is, i-- is critical. Uhm, it has to do with the issue of anger and aggressive behavior. Anger is really interesting cuz of the transdiagnostic kind of presenting problem. So, you could look, of course, a whole variety of psychiatric disorders and find the, ah, manifestation of anger and the accompanying instances of aggressive behavior. So, whether you look at psychotic patients who have command hallucinations and delusional systems, whether you're looking at antisocial behavior, ah, and psychopaths who are engaging in instrumental aggressive behavior and we'll see that aggression has a lot of different forms, uhm, whether you're looking at people who are depressed, clinically depressed. It turns out that clinically depressed people are not turning anger inward, they're all metaphor, but rather it's-- Fava and others have demonstrated that, ah, clinically depressed people are, ah, pretty externalizing in the expression of anger, whether you look at people who have explosive disorders or borderline personality disorders. So, anger is a kind of unifying, ah, concept that, ah, is evident. It's interesting that of all the, ah, DSM categories, you know, if you look at the number of anxiety disorders, if you look at the number of depression disorders, you know, there are 10 of this, nine of this, and so forth but there is no diagnostic category for chronic or intermittent anger. And there, as you'll see in the handbook, there is a good deal of effort underway to elevate, ah, anger and ex-- and e-- explosive disorders into something that would be a classification code. Now, we, we need to recognize at the outset that there's nothing wrong in being angry, that anger is a useful and healthy emotion, that there would be no social change, there would be no feminist movement, no gay rights, no Amnesty International unless people felt angry. That is they have to see a discrepancy between the way things are and the way they would like them to be. They have to have a perceived-- a perception that there's an inequity and injustice and unfairness that needs to be addressed and resolved. So, it's not that people get angry or they get angers-- anxious or they get depressed, what we're going to see is what do they do with that anger. So, anger like these other affective responses are indeed, uhm, consistent with, ah, the evolution of man and, and, and in fact, being a healthy and useful, ah, response. It's when anger is out of proportion, when it's either directed at others, or against oneself it becomes problematic and we will see it interferes with, ah, the development of resilience. Now, apropos of, ah, this presentation, when you get to the handout on the Evolution of Psychotherapy, you can go on the conference website or you can go on the Melissa Institute. I put all 357 pages of this-- of my handouts on the Melissa Institutes or if there's-- go to author index, scroll down, see evolution. When you do that, this presentation are pages 60 to 80 of that 357 on adults and the second piece on children and the trajectory is on pages 108 to 164. So if you can-- if you got-- ah, can access on your WiFi here or, or-- you can't do it in the hotel but, uhm, later on, you'll be able to, ah, follow this presentation up. Uhm, I'm going to start of by having us appreciate the nature of what we mean by anger. Ah, one of the things that, ah, becomes interesting is, ah, I, ah, has spent a lot of time, ah, listening to people tell stories about how other people or circumstances have made them angry. See, psychotherapy is kind of interesting, you know. It's not some sexy enterprise. Essentially, what you get paid to do as a psychotherapist is to listen to people's stories. I mean, it's that, that's, that's, that's therapy. See, I'm going to tell you a story about what my four kids did to me, you got that? And I will not pass up this opportunity to cathodically discharge, okay, to this size group of mental health workers and not have to pay for it. Okay, you, you kidding me? I mean, would you pass up this opportunity? I know someone here will submit a bill, you know, they'll go, you know,-- I, you know, I don't do these things for free, you know, you... So, I'm gonna share with you an anecdote, ah, and the analysis of the anecdote is actually on page 142 when you get to the handout. H-- how many people here in the room have children and are willing to admit it? Okay, yeah, yeah-- okay. So, you know, if you're a clinician, one of the things that becomes interesting in this domain is that I would get a lot of referrals. I mean, very few friend-- very few children come to me on their own, you know, and say, "Dr. Meichenbaum, I wonder if, ah, Thursday afternoon at 3:30 is okay, okay? I'm having a lot of problems, I'm fooled by reading comprehension, there's a lot of marital distress in my home, uhm, I'm a subject to sibling rivalry and I'd like to come in and talk, okay? In fact, some schools are now teaching kids how to refer themselves. So, the major reason that I see kids is because they have violated the tolerance level of their parent, okay. Would you please fix this? Can I take his idea? It's-- you got medication, what are you gonna do? Okay. I mean, he's like his father. I can't believe he got inherited it. I mean, what do you... So, so the major reason that people are referred, children are referred is because of repetitive non-compliance. Repetitive noncompliance is the major reason and, and that repetitive noncompliance escalates. And h-- here's the most important statistic you'll take home from this presentation if indeed you are a parent. We actually studied when parents become angry and then when that escalates the point of aggressive behavior. So, we ask parents specially mothers to keep track when they angry and what we were able to do is to ascertain that each day that your child wakes up, you wake up as a parent ready and primed to make well over 200 compliance request of your kid per day. It just flows from the sanious of your body. Okay, how many times they got to come in the room? Okay. I tell you get in the room, look at the thing here, okay? Do you know what time it is? Who left the lights on all night? I mean, whose shoes are these anyway? I mean, you know whose shoes they are. You got ripped off from buying them, okay. See, a lot of compliance request come in the form of questions the answer to which you know. Okay. I mean, how do you think these shoes get from downstairs up to your room, huh? Huh? Do you think we have gremlins? You wanna study parent anger? You wanna study mother's compliance request? We put tape recorders under the kitchen table to ascertain the number of compliance request mothers come to the table with, okay. Not only do they come with food, they come with this inherent list, "Don't say yuck, you haven't even tried it." "Don't talk with your mouth full," "What you have in your hand right there is called a fork, not a shovel," "You know, they have napkins for that," "What do you mean you're chewing gum and potatoes at the same time? That's absolutely disgusting," and this is just the wife to the husband. You'll just see what happens when that kid comes in.

DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Normal, healthy kids only comply with one-half to two-thirds of parental request, okay. If you have an expectation of 100% compliance you are in for a very distressing day. Not only that, it turns out that out of non-compliance comes a lot of social problems solving. We don't hit mommy, okay? God gave us words, okay? Here's the anecdote. I'll present it to you and then we're going to analyze it and based on the analysis, you're going to come to see what a cognitive behavior perspective is on anger. Then what I'm going to do is fill the rest of the day with you looking at a lot of very angry individuals. I mentioned yesterday that I love doing psychotherapy and counseling and part of the reason I love doing psychotherapy and counseling is I love the way I think about cases. I am totally enamored with my head. I mean, I don't know what the hell you think of it but I am having one hell of a fill day, okay? So, when I show you these tapes, okay, I'm actually going to tell you like I did yesterday all the things that are going through my head, okay, and I supervise a lot of psychiatrist, psychologist, social workers, and others and when we supervise them, I wanna know what's going through their head. So, I am not only the proud father of four but I am even prouder of being the possessor of three garbage cans. Now, each Tuesday morning I would put out those three garbage cans, they would sort of get me going in the morning and I would ask my four children on multiple occasions to please, please bring in the garbage cans. I do not find that to be an unreasonable request given all that I do for them and what if I said no too lately, right? So, I put out the garbage cans and I go off to work. Now, at work, things do not go really well. You know, I take these letters in to the secretaries early in the morning to get done, they have to go out and as the day is progressing, they're not getting to my letters. That's what happens when you're a nice guy. Okay, you, you get overlooked, right? Graduate students, okay. They're worse than your own kids. I am at the library, I go out of my way to find this article that is right up the students' dissertation area and this guy has nailed the literature. I mean, all she has to do is paraphrase it and not plagiarize it and she will be able to move on, okay. So, I go out of my way and copy it and I give it to her, okay. It's one week later, okay, I say what do you think of the article? She says, "I have not had a chance to read it." "You what? This is graduate school? What the hell you're doing with your life? I mean, what do you mean you didn't read the article?" I'm going to a conference, I need the data analyzed, I'm trying to determine if what we actually found in the study is at anyway similar to the abstract I submitted at three months early. J-- just any similarity at all? Did we ever f-- did I say that? So, you could see the kind of day I'm having. So, I come home and what do I see but the three garbage cans. Not only the three garbage cans are there, but the kids' bikes are all over the driveway. We have talked about that. My son's knew baseball glove, the one that I feel I got ripped off for. I mean, this glove cost more money than all the baseball gloves I ever owned in my entire childhood. I mean, how much it could have been cost? I mean, what are you talking about? A coward? It's sitting there on the front porch, that's the exact spot where the last glove was stolen from. Well, given this array of stimuli with regard to the garbage cans and bikes and the glove, I go into the house in my clinically sensitive fashion. No, ah, I mean, this is important, right? This is a, a non-compliance with a request, okay, it's not that hard. So, what do I do? Okay, I gotta get a bright idea. What I'm gonna do is round up the four kids. Okay, just stop whatever you were doing, okay, come down right now, all for of you. And what do I do is I march the four kids out to the curb and what we're going to do is have the five of us stand around the three garbage cans. I want you to picture this. And what we're gonna do is hold hands and have a seance and see what thoughts, if any, emerge. Okay, I mean, you got-- and you can see the neighbor looking at her window going, "Oh my God! He's at it again." Okay, so there we are, the five of us around the three garbage cans, okay. When my son Dave kinda interesting character says, "Can I say something?" And I say, "Not now, Dave. We're waiting for thoughts to emerge." And he says, "No, no, this is very, very important," and I say, "It better be," and he says, "I don't know how to tell you this, dad. But you see these three garbage cans? They're not ours. These are Billy's(ph) garbage cans from across the street. We just left them here to see how you would react." 

00:25:50
[sil.] 

00:25:55
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM You have any doubt why I study anger and aggressive behavior? Do you ever wonder why the instance of child abuse is not higher? 

00:26:05
[sil.] 

00:26:10
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM So, the in-- here's the critical question? How do I respond when he tells me they're not my garbage cans? Do I see this as a personal threat and provocation? "What do you mean they're not our garbage cans?" I mean, "Whose idea was this anyway? Huh? Huh? Was mom part of this?" This is not about the garbage cans. See the bikes, see the glove? Do you have any idea what would happen if I had done that to my father, huh? Huh? Now, where the hell did he come from, right? He's been dead over a decade. He's what we call availability mental heuristic in your back pocket that you could call out at any given time. Don, when I, your father, died, I give you my name to use in anyway you find appropriate to socialize your children. I only have one requirement, the stories you tell about me should be terrible so by contrast you look good, okay? This is what? This is my gift to you. I don't have money but go for it, okay? You have any idea what would happen if I had done that to my father, huh? Huh? I'll tell you why. Each of you, go up to your room and have a personal seance and when you get the message you will come down here and then, and then alone will I ever allow you to eat again in your life. Have you ever listen to parents in this state? Okay, this is what I call limbic logic. It's decorticate. I'm on a plane, right? Mother sitting there with a kid who's being non-compliant. She says, "If you don't sit there with the seat belt, see that button? I press that button, the roof opens, you're gone." I mean, this is a good stuff, come on, all right! I'm in a hot tub, right? No kids allowed, right? Kid comes in, you think he's gonna be non-compliance of dividing hot tub, right? Father says, "See that? How-- what a feeling? Stay in here more than four minutes, you lose your legs." 

00:28:30

00:28:35
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM So, do I see this trick of putting these garbage cans that are not mine on the corner as a personal threat and provocation. Ooh! On the other hand, do I see this as a creative venture on their part? I-- thi-- this stuff you've been pulling on me. I mean, it's funnier than anything I see on those sitcoms. I hope one of you grow up and write for those sitcoms, I could benefit from the residuals. That's the story. You know what you're got paid to do? You get paid to listen to people's garbage cans stories. That is the occupation you have each gone into. Okay, you're gonna hear all kinds of garbage cans stories. That's what anger is. I can't believe the way they drive here, this California, right? All right, I'll put you, assholes, okay. I mean, these kids are driving on the road with my wife, okay. Okay, she stayed out all night, the bitch would, ah, ah, had to lined up in my sites. I would have blown their goddamn brains out, okay. You get paid to listen to people's garbage cans story, that's what anger is. So, the key question is how do you get from being angry to being aggressive? I'm gonna give you the algorithm of what you need to do in terms of the perception of a provocation, the attribution of intentionality. You gotta think that they're doing it to you on purpose. But before we get to that algorithm, let's just take a moment of what goes through your head as a collision as you listen to people tell stories. See, life is filled with garbage cans. In fact, when we ran parent groups, I self-disclose, I tell stories like the garbage can story and when people come out of therapy and they go to see their friends, okay, they say, "W-- what did you get out of that therapy? You know, you go to all those group meetings and so forth," and the guy looks at the kids, "I'll, I'll tell you what I got. I've learned to look for garbage cans. That's what I got out of therapy." Okay, so what happens is you tell stories in therapy and people co-- condense that story and that becomes their way of taking your voice with them. And, and what is a garbage can story? Is it-- you can see it as a personal threat and provocation or you could see it as an imaginative, creative activity to get you to alter your pattern of behavior. How do you show compassion? how do you teach people to do perspective taking? So, let's take this particular anecdote and you gotten paid to listen to my story. So, what goes through your head? I mean, the first thing that goes through your head as a clinician might be "You think you got trouble with your kids? You wanna hear about my kids?" And you go, "No, too early for self-disclosure," right? I mean, if my patient knew how bad off my life is, they will never come back. I mean, you're kidding-- I mean, this is-- okay. So, it turns out that this anecdote is rather complex in nature and we're gonna be able to a-- apply this analysis to all the people you're gonna meet. So, one of the first kinds of questions that I have, ah, for the client as well as me as a parent is what was your goal in that situation, what is that you wanted to have happened. Ah, it was a-- I j-- I just wanted the kids to bring in the garbage cans. I'm going a little bit of respect, okay. I mean, given all that I do for them? I, I wanna come and just greet my wife and be quiet. I know-- I want the goddamn fighting to stop, okay? I, I don't want another call from the principal, okay? I just wanna have my beer, okay? I mean, it's, it's not all-- that's my goal, okay? So, so, so, w-- what, what happened in this incident is different from the goal. A-- and Don, given what you've just described, when you came home and saw the garbage cans, the bikes, and the glove, h-- h-- how do you, how do you, how do you go about getting them to do that? So, what of the questions I have is not only what's the goal of the client, what is it they want but I also wanna ascertain one of the skills that they use. I mean, Don, is this way you go about getting compliance? Of bringing them down to the seance? So, what I'm going to do is try and ascertain from that parent to a parent or whosever how-- what's the skills level that they have. I mean, do they have a deficit in communication? Do they keep making "you" statements instead of "I" statements? Is this someone who I need to teach how to make compliance request given all of the research that we know in that domain? So, one of the questions I have is what are nature of the kind of skills that my client has to achieve their goals and is this someone I'm gonna have to put in the parent group, okay, the communication skill, am I gonna have to give bibli-- what? Not only that, let me define the behavioral repertoire broader so it's not only that which you do or fail to do but what are the kinds of expectations you have in that situations. I mean, do you have an expectation of 100% com-- "I am the father here, okay? There is no such thing as your room. You got that? When you pay rent, it's your room. Okay, so when we clean up, okay, when you keep guns in the room, okay, when you do-- this is my house. You are lucky I'm letting you live here." So, one of the things that becomes interesting is what are the kinds of expectations you have. We are going to visit grandma. Grandma lives 400 miles away, you have two boys sitting in the back of a car. How many fights do you think those two boys should have within the 400 miles? "He's touching me, he's got his finger in his nose, he's on my side, okay. That was my toy, I'm turning the station." So, let's say that you expect one fight every 50 miles, that's fewer than I have with my wife when I go on these kinds of trips. So, you have an expectation of eight fights between your house and grandma's house. So, if you only get four fights going down, you have saved four fights for the way coming home. Okay, one of the things that we know about parents who abuse their children, specially single parents if you look at all literature therein, is that they often have unrealistic expectations of what children should be able to accomplish. They often have misinformed norms about when children should manifest particular behavior at given stages. And later on I'll share with you all the reasons why parents and other people get angry given our research in this particular domain. What am I doing? I'm getting in to your head. You have listen to me tell this story, this anecdote about the garbage cans. We are now analyzing it into its component parts. You are sitting there saying, "Okay, w-- m-- m-- maybe it's, it's, it's a deficit, okay, in terms of the skills, in terms of the communication the way in which this guy gets compliance. Maybe it's the kind of expectations that he has in that given situation and the violation of those. Not only that, maybe he has automatic thoughts of attributions of intentionality. You know, that he, he thinks these people are doing it to him on purpose and you cannot get from anger the aggression without the attribution of intentionality. So, one of the things that becomes interesting is how do you get into your clients head. "Don, let me ask you and something a bit different," the clinician says. Could you sit back in the chair and just close your eyes and could you reply in slow motion for me and for yourself the kinds of thoughts and feelings that you had that preceded, that accompany, and then follow that situation? Using imagery construction is a very interesting way to get people to attend today that they would not otherwise attend to cuz I come in and tell you what the kids into me. I'm rather-- first thing this, the garbage can, then the bikes and the glove and what happens is that I failed to report to you the kind of ideational content and accompanying feelings that prece-- so, so, so Don, let's, let's go back, okay? It wa-- it was not a good day at work with the secretaries, the graduate students, the computer? So, so you're getting in the car, pick it out from there, okay. Could you just sort of walk me through it? So, you turn the corner and what do you see? The garbage cans, the bikes, the glove? And the thought that goes through your head is, "Oh shit! Not again! I get no goddamn respect," so what you're gonna do is try and get people to become aware of the internal dialogue that precede, that accompanies, that then follows. So you want people to appreciate that the anger that they're experience, the depression that they're experiencing and the like don't just come on. You know, I'm a cognitive behavior therapist. Thoughts don't just arrive, depression doesn't come. "Hi, Don. I hear you going to lunch this afternoon. I like to join you." "Who are you? Depression? Oh! You come alone?" "No, I came with co-morbidity." "Good, I'll reserve a table, okay?" With the whole table there, who I'll see you coming along, okay? Substance abuse, suicide, al-- depression doesn't come, anger doesn't arrive, the whole name of the game is how do you help people appreciate to how they unwittingly, unknowingly, and inadvertently contribute to the very problems that they're complaining about. How do they behave in ways that fall for certain reactions? I mean, you can't say to your client, "Don't you see what you're doing? I mean, you act like a non-neglect that what the hell is gonna happen, okay? I mean, for you the glass is always half empty. It's over. It wasn't your fault. Let it go." They don't need clinicians who talk to them like that. They relatives and spouses who talk to them like that. So, the name of the game is how can we help clients become aware of that process. So, I want them to sort of see in the old Elise tradition if A) was the garbage cans, the bikes, and the glove, okay and C) if you're getting angry. Help me understand the B, and I want them to do appreciate that they do so in a mood congruent fashion. That when people are ex-- aroused, they tend to call up other such examples, okay. Do you have any idea what would happen if I did that to my father, huh? Huh? Oh, where the hell is he? I mean, he's been dead for 10 years. He's in availability heuristic that you can call up at anytime. This is not about the garbage cans. Remember, we went to grandma, all the fights? You, you remember so and so? I mean-- so, one of the things that's really interesting that I spent a lot of time in Israel and in the Middle East, right? You think I will make peace with your people when four generations ago they took this land from that land? You think in a Battle of Orange that we are going to let it? You think I will invite her to Bar Mitzvah? Twelve years ago she never gave a gift. You think I'm gonna make up for this now? Huh? You, you know, what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna put her next to her sister who she hates. That will teach her a goddamn lesson. I mean, the past history is like-- yeah, this is old anger kicking in. You have a backlog in there that you could call out at any given time and you do so in a mood congruent fashion. If you are depression, you becomes a channel selector. Ah! Depression, wait a second. How much time do you have? Not only that you need to ask the question of, "So, when you did this to the kids, how did they respond? What happened?" And one of the things we know specially in terms of parenting is that this is a bidirectional process. It's not only that kids-- parents affect kids but kids affect parents. So, if you look at all the work of, ah, Gerald Patterson in Belle and all these other people, it's bidirectional and when we look at making a violent youth in the second half of this presentation we'll start to see all the work on parenting and the notion about how specially conduct disorder, aggressive kids, oppositional kids tend to pull counter aggression on the part of the parents. So, if the kid yells or screams, the parents yell and scream, okay, and it escalates. So, the name of the game is it takes to dance here or a couple or a family in order to get to see that kind of interactional process. You've just listen to my garbage can stories, you're now going through your head as to what's going on. Does the person have a deficit and that's where the action is. Do they have certain kind of cognitions about expectations, attributions, or intentionality? Did they go around where the chip on their soldier and see provocations all over. Do they tend to engage in dichotomous thinking? You're either with me or you're against me, okay? Interesting, this is not only applies to parent-child, it also applies to nations. So, in fact, if you go to the Melissa Institute website, I have written papers on how to improve governmental decision making. I have a fanciful notion what the world would be like if in every cabinet of George Bush, Obama, Netanyahu and others there was a cognitive behavior therapist who can sit there and watch how decisions are made. You, you, you think it might be useful when we invade Iraq that we have a follow up plan? You, you think there's any kind of consequential thinking? You know, I, I noticed that when you presented to the U.N. I was wondering if you had question the source of the data that you were using. I mean, I, I noticed that Dick Cheney was the last person you always talk to and he noticed this angler by the CIA, always had the emails from other people go through him so he can make the-- did you ever notice how he games the system, huh? So, you can go and read about the 12 dirty dozen errors that politicians have made from the Bay of Pigs to the Gulf of Tonkin to World War I to the invasion of Iraq and it would be interesting from my point of view if you had someone sitting in the back. I mean, this is like a distress couple. I mean, this is what I do for a living. I watch how they argue. I say-- I noticed something, I wonder if you noticed it too. Okay. So you are a consultant to the process of decision making so I presented to the War College, to many other people on wha-- how you make decisions on-- these are all errors in thinking. So, when you say, "Either you're with me or you're against me," okay, if you say, "Where going in to Iraq cuz we're having a crusade." Mr. President, you think we should use another analogy besides the word crusade when you're going in to the Middle East? You think it has any surplus meaning? Can we think of another word? George Bush Sr., right? "We are going to invade Iraq," this is Senior, right? Why? Because Hitler is in the Middle East. Now, that's kind of interesting. He had enumerable historical figures. He could have said, "Mussolini is in the Middle East." Now, who the hell is going to send 300,000 troops to get Mussolini with the boots and the guy, okay? But if you say, "Hitler is in the Middle East," ah, that's a powerful metaphor. Not only that, why would we not then take out Hitler and go to Baghdad, right? So, when they make the decision, "Nazi go to Baghdad," the word "Hitler" disappears. McCain past presidential-- just recent-- I mean-- I wa-- all you have to do is watch Jon Stewart. He gives you millions of examples like this, okay? So, McCain says, "Obama shaking hands with Raul Castro is like Chamberlain shaking hands with Hitler." You know what Stewart did when he heard that? No-- I mean, so what happens is people use analogies, these are thinking errors that esca-- and if you think that that's the same. So, people use metaphors and analogies in that way. So, I need to know the bidirectionality, I need to know the consequences. Enough here in my garbage can stories. Let's listen to some people who have problems with anger. I'm going to show you three guys who we work with who have problems with anger and as you listen to these three guys, I want you to become an exquisite listener to their thinking styles, to the way in which they have expectations, violations, personal provocations the way in which they take this personally. I want you to listen to the way in which they engage in dichotomous thinking, I want you to see the way in which they see provocations all over the place, and in addition, I'd also like you to see if you see any strains to these guys. Okay, let's see if, ah, we can get this to work. Is there something I have to do to turn this on? Hit the space bar. 

00:47:35
[sil.] 

00:47:40
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM ... into his ahead, okay, could you-- you really want to understand as a clinician, from my perspective, of what are the kinds of thinking processes people engage in that gets them into aggressive behavior and whether, in fact, there were any kind of redeeming features that you could build upon in this particular case. So, this a guy name Naidick(ph) who, ah, ah, ran this group. I, ah, actually did work on domestic violence in the military, ah, I spent August in, ah, Death Valley, California and looking for a nice, warm spot in a place call Fort Irwin. Uhm, looking at, ah, v-- violence and, ah, we videotaped, I didn't get permission to show those so I showed this guy instead. So, let's listen to what happened. His life is filled a whole bunch of garbage cans, right? I mean, he wants to talk and so forth and she's not coming and, and not only that, they were out to get me all this time, okay, it's the same kind of thing. And moreover, ah, he then has a theory about his emotion. These guys have a really interesting theory. You know, once it flows, it flows, okay? I have no control. It turns out they have lots of control, okay. You know, these guys don't hit their wives in front of offices, they don't often hit them in, in places that it will show-- but he has a notion that if he talks about it, once it gets going, it gets going. Not only does he have the thing with the wife but in his house. These guys are telling him how to treat his wife, okay. So, you can see it and then he, you know, she's playing her goddamn silly games, she's doing it on purpose. The other thing that's interesting about this guy if we had more time to, ah, explore is that he has some kind of redeeming features that you could build on to. You know, he would have kill for that, he has achievement motiva-- he stays home with their daughter, okay? Not, not only that, he had a line up in the sides and I'm not going to jail for her. So, he-- not only that, I would capitalize on the fact that I'm-- wait a second. Are you telling that this is what I talked about yesterday, uhm, trying to teach, ah, clinicians the art of questioning. I, ah, encourage people yesterday to emulate that fine inquisitor of a TV personage, ah, Peter Falk playing character of Columbo. You know, be-- a part of his bemusement, getting them-- for me. As I said yesterday, I tried to train clinicians on how to play dumb. For some, this is not a difficult nor a challenging role. It comes remarkable e-- are you telling me-- are you saying to Columbo that you have two ways of drinking? So, most of people I see only have one way of drinking. How do you decide which way to drink? And if you're drinking one way, could you actually choose the other way? It turns out, ah, in about 50% of the cases, substance abuse, specially alcohol, goes along with violence. So, if you look at domestic violence or you look at, ah, child abuse or other kinds of instances, ah, the role of alcohol as we'll see is going to be critical, it has a lot of implications for, ah, treating co-morbidity. Ah, let, let me play just a couple of others who have garbage can stories. Ah, ah, out of curiosity, how many people in the audience as a going to graduate school at some of the form of training actually had to watch a set of movies of Fritz Perls, Albert Ellis, and Carl Rogers interviewing Gloria? That's kind of interesting. It's like an initiation rite to the profession. You know, if you want to go in and making a living out of this, you have to sit through this three hours, okay. And this is very-- we assure you, cuz if this is the best day have in the field, I can make a living at this. I mean, one guy is scratching his beard, the other guy attacking the women, and the other one go, "Hmm, hmm, hmm, bye. Hmm. I got it, got it, got. I got it with you." Okay. So, they decided to remake the three's films, uhm, and then they asked Aaron Beck, ah, recently at the party at Hand Strap and myself to all interview a character called Richard, a person name Richard. Richard is a character but he's kind of interesting. So, I'm going to show you a small clip of Richard and, uhm, he has two problems when he entered. And what happens is-- and we only had this one hour like the Gloria kind of film to demonstrate some of the interventions. So, he has real problems with anger specially the way people drive in California, that's where he's located and he also has problems with depression. So, I decided to go for the face of anger given that I only have a small period of time. So, what I'm going to do is provoke him in the course of the session to see how close to the surface the anger is, okay. You can turn on the, ah, the video and you could record this as well, and, uhm... 

00:52:45
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM ... deal with that anger. Are there other ways to express the anger either to your wife or to other people? 

00:52:50
RICHARD Express the anger. 

00:52:55
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Any... 

00:52:55
RICHARD I have... 

00:52:55
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM How else did people handle anger - 

00:53:00
[sil.] 

00:53:05
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM - beside just letting balloons go, besides wrecking cars and... 

00:53:05
RICHARD O-- one outlet is I when, when I run, I run, when I jog, I jog till I almost drop. 

00:53:10
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Uh-huh. Finding with someone else. Let's say someone else has done something that irritates you. You know, they press you and con-- you know, they don't meet what you think, they don't behave the way you feel they should behave and you get angry and pissed off. How, how does one handle that when, when you're doing those? 

00:53:30
RICHARD Give him a piece of your mind. You tell this, tell this son of a bitch to go to hell. 

00:53:40
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Uhm, come on Richard, what do you mean? I had it funny, don't hang if you're honk at me. 

00:53:45
RICHARD What? Kick your ass, son of a bitch. 

00:53:50
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM I like to see you try it. 

00:53:55
RICHARD I'm getting no one else to cherish you are here. 

00:54:00
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM I guess I'm wondering Richard. What else is there to do besides kicking one's ass when people don't? 

00:54:10
RICHARD Shut up! 

00:54:10
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM You could yell. 

00:54:15
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM If this guy gets this angry here, what do you think goes on out there? And then not only that, when he sneeze, he only sees, "I'm wondering how serious you are." Richard, this is called role playing, I picked it up in a workshop. Why not, fella? So, the intent here was to see given that I have a limited amount of the time but I'm acting as if I were the other driver and I could assure you specially in terms of the stress inoculation training that we developed that's described in the Anger Book where you do psychoeducation, skills training, and then we do actual application training that if, in fact, you provoke people, I'm gonna see how important it is to actually practice in session and in vivo. You need to process with the person so what just happen to Richard? I acted as if I were the other driver and what did we see. Cuz what happens is these clients lose perspective that you are a therapist and if they feel that you made them angry, they-- it breaks the boundaries of the relationship, okay. So, what I want you to do is to see that the provocation here I-- did I just say with the clock, was I acted as if I was the other driver and then you could see the emotionality, the three o'clock, in this clock metaphor coming out and now you're gonna hear the thinking processes, okay. And then I'll tell you a bit about Richard and what got him in here. So, let's, ah, go back and, ah, pick up on that. 

00:55:45
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM That's clearly one thing. Besides kicking ass and yelling, what else can one do? 

00:56:00
RICHARD Show love. 

00:56:00
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM So, one of the things that's really interesting from an information processing perspective is-- and this is true both for children, adolescents, and adults is that when (inaudible ) Coopersmith and, and Holtzworth-Munroe and other people looking at the thinking process of people who are angry, they tend to engage in a lot of dichotomous thinking. You know what you do? You take them out, okay? Don't take any of that goddamn crap! What else could you do? You could show love. Won't you think there might be anything in between? Okay. So, when-- these are like computer programs in people's head and what happens is when they see a provocation, they call up the most dominant response that has worked in the past which is aggressive behavior, either reactive aggression, you know, they're button gets pressed, or instrumental aggression where they're gonna do something intentional to get some kind of objective, okay. So, you know, I'm, I'm trying to get you to sort of listen to be a cognitive ethologist as I describe it. You know, ethologist follow, you know how, you know, fish swim up stream and fornicating, do all this kind. I want you to see how people do this to their heads. You take them out, and you show love. Nothing. 

00:57:20
RICHARD Show love. 

00:57:20
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM When you're all pissed off and a guy cut in front of you, you're gonna show love? What does that mean, show love? 

00:57:30
RICHARD (inaudible ). 

00:57:40
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Are there other things one can do besides kick ass, yell, show love? 

00:57:50
[sil.] 

00:57:55
RICHARD Understand that the other person is just a human being. 

00:57:55
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM You know, I like you. Ah, you, you even thought about it at the beginning. Perhaps there are other ways to express feelings. Uhm, letting people know what it is about what they've done that you find so upsetting. You know, Richard, when you do X in situation in Y, it makes me feel Z. Are you aware that you did that? I mean, is, is that a way you that you might be able to communicate with your wife? I mean, I guess one of the things that we would do in future sessions would be to understand what it is that triggers your anger. What's common among those different situations? 

00:58:40
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Well, relay to the same session. 

00:58:45
RICHARD I'm ha-- I'm having a problem right now where I'm, where I'm working. Ah, the fellow that, ah, I ran a machine and the fellow that runs the machine right next to me, we-- we're almost at arm's length - 

00:59:00
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay. 

00:59:00
RICHARD - like-- just like you and I, all right, all night long - 

00:59:05
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Uh-huh. 

00:59:05
RICHARD - and the guy talks all night long. 

00:59:05
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM He just keeps going on. 

00:59:05
RICHARD He's got diarrhea of the mouth - 

00:59:10
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Right. 

00:59:10
RICHARD - and he goes on and on and on. And... 

00:59:10
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM It just great on you. 

00:59:15
RICHARD Yes. And first I was-- I said, "What in the hell have I gone the counseling for if I haven't learned how to communicate?" And, and I've, I've get down on myself because I wouldn't say, "Hey, look. Jim(ph), let me talk to you about this problem that you're talking all night long." At first it went through my head and then, ah, then I was gonna take, pick him outside and punch him out. 

00:59:35
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Now, those are interesting alternatives. You know, I'm paying good money for counseling, I've learned a number of skills perhaps I can use that with this guy. If that doesn't work, I'll take him outside and wipe him out, okay. I-- this guy talking all night is a garbage can. You're getting paid to listen to that. Remember, now he has problems with anger, he also has problems with depression. Now that we've seen the face of anger, let's look at happen to this about depression. 

01:00:10
RICHARD No, I said, "That's not good. That's not right." And then, well, I just turn my back on it for a while and maybe it'll, maybe it'll go away, it'll go away by itself and then, then I went-- got to the point where I said, "Well, you're just a human being, ah, the guy is-- he's kind of a school boy and, ah, I'll just, ah, take him for what he is and, ah, I don't-- I won't get when he talks and I listen then I walk away. So, I'm tolerating him a lot better right now - 

01:00:40
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Uh-hmm. 

01:00:40
RICHARD - but I'm still disappointed in myself that I have not communicated to him what's buggin' me. 

01:00:50
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Right. So the fuse is still short? 

01:00:50
RICHARD Yes. 

01:00:55
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM And given the right circumstances, you can go like that. 

01:00:55
RICHARD Yes. 

01:01:00
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM And the question is how do you communicate with someone that what they're doing bugs you but without turning that person away. 

01:01:10
RICHARD Yes. 

01:01:10
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM I mean, how do you tell your wife, how do you tell this guy that there are things that they do that irritate you? They bother you but-- that you don't violate the whole relationship. One other question, one other observation that you made that I'd like to pursue a little bit, if I may, you say not only do you feel this anger but you also feel depressed? 

01:01:40
RICHARD Yes. 

01:01:40
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM And I'm wondering if you can share with me a bit about that depression? 

01:01:50
RICHARD Ah, the depression is the loss of everything that we've mentioned including my wife and everything. The depression is also that I do not have a female companion right now. I desperately miss the love of a woman, the touch, the-- where they place things in the house. I miss a woman... 

01:02:10
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM So you feel lonely? 

01:02:10
RICHARD I'm very lonely and I'm-- and I'm also almost to the point of, ah, panic or anxiety because I have had 10-- I don't know how many dates I've had this year. I lost track of them but I rarely do I call a woman back up again because I just can't be able to find anybody that I really felt that I was-- that fit what I was looking for, - 

01:02:40
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Uh-hmm. 

01:02:40
RICHARD - looks, personality, position, and I'm starting to get a little panicky about will I ever-- cuz I realized it's only have been a-- it's been a very short time - 

01:02:50
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM That's right. 

01:02:50
RICHARD - but I'm starting to get panicky - 

01:02:50
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Uh-huh. 

01:02:50
RICHARD - about that. 

01:02:50
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Yeah. And it sounds like we have a shopping list and as you go around inside, inside, ah... 

01:03:00
RICHARD Ah, a shopping list, uhm... 

01:03:05
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM I mean, about the features that people should fit. I mean, you have this list of... 

01:03:05
RICHARD Yes. She's got to be looking to begin with. 

01:03:10
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Yeah and... 

01:03:10
RICHARD She's gonna, she's gonna turn me on physically, - 

01:03:15
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay. 

01:03:15
RICHARD - and, ah, she's got to be educated. 

01:03:20
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Tell me a bit about the depression. H-- how bad off is it and when does it occur and... 

01:03:25
RICHARD Ah, it's a peaks and valleys. I think, ah, the worst time is when I'm sitting at home by myself on, ah, ah, I just, ah, done the wash, I've just, ah, clean the house and, ah, the football game was just over and the ram-- this wouldn't be a Saturday, you know, the football game would be over and I just, ah, my team just lost and, ah, it's three o'clock in the afternoon. I've got my food shopping down then I've got absolu-- I don't have a date and I have absolutely nothing to do and I don't feel like reading a book. And I get sit around, I get very depressed, I get feeling sorry for myself and, ah, am I gonna commit suicide and just get very depressed. I just don't-- I don't feel like talking to anybody. 

01:04:10
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Com-- commit suicide? 

01:04:15
RICHARD Yeah. 

01:04:15
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Tell me about a bit about that how... 

01:04:20
RICHARD That, ah, that thought has entered into my head, committing suicide. 

01:04:25
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Hmm, what are the thoughts do you have when you're sitting there and... 

01:04:35
RICHARD Well, the, the, the first-- first thing I get thinking about is, ah, what will I write in the note, how will I fill the note out, and who will I, who will I address it to, ah, or will I address it to anybody or will I leave a note. Do I have to leave a note, screw the world, there are bunches of son of the bitches anyway, and I get thinking about that and I get thinking about getting my gun. 

01:04:55
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM You, you have a gun available in the house? 

01:05:00
RICHARD Uh-huh. I have two of them. 

01:05:00
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Uh-hmm. 

01:05:00
RICHARD Ah, I think about getting my gun and, ah, and then I get thinking about the mess that I'll leave. I w-- I would never commit-- so I'm gonna do it with a gun, you see. 

01:05:15
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Uh-hmm. 

01:05:15
RICHARD And I would never do it in the house because it leaves too much of a mess. So, what you've gotta do is I've got a garage, this apartment where I live. So, I'm gonna go down the garage and I'm gonna nail up, ah, plywood boards on the wall and on the floor so-- and you see also you can't go like this cuz you might miss, it might get shaken so I'm gonna put it here, you gotta put it in your mouth. You're gonna put it in your mouth and pull the trigger on, when you pull the trigger and, and all your brains go shoot so it'll hit the plywood wall and... 

01:05:45
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM And avoid a mess. 

01:05:45
RICHARD And avoid a mess, right. So, when the people come in to clean up all they have to do is pull the plywood down. 

01:05:50
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM You're a very considerate person. 

01:05:50
RICHARD Yes. Well-- wait, I'm not finish yet. 

01:05:50
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay. Go ahead. 

01:05:50
RICHARD And also you put a big blanket on the floor too. The big heavy blanket so it'll absorbs all the blood. And so when the people come in to clean up, all they do is take the blanket and then throw up together and take it off from the ground. 

01:06:05
[sil.] 

01:06:15
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM I told you that during the entire course of therapy I'm constantly talking to myself covertly. At this moment in time, I am saying, "Holy shit! What are we dealing here? Ah, Gloria never had any of these problems? What a-- what have I got? What are you talking about?" I mean, this is a potential homicide, suicide alert. This is California, the towers of decision still stands. There's a question about do you have to notify anyone? I mean, do you have to make a protective thing about the wife? Okay. I mean, if this guy and if you take that step and he finds out that you are instrumental, what-- I mean, this is going into this profession is not for the softhearted. So, the interesting question is given what you just heard, what is the next thing that comes out of your mouth? Now, all of therapy are choice points so the interesting issue is he's just giving you a detail. Not only that, what the hell is the point of the boards and the blankets? I mean, if you're gonna kill yourself, who cares a shit about the rug? 

01:07:50
[sil.] 

01:07:55
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM So, put yourself in my shoes. What would you say next and here's one answer I will never ever accept. You cannot lean over to Richard and say, "Richard, it sounds to me like you have a number of serious problems. I only do short-term therapy." Now, I met some people in Anaheim who have given their card who are always looking for clients and said I would like to put in touch with one of those people and she sat next to me, I, I can handle him, okay. Okay, put yourself in my shoes. I mean, he's very narcissistic, right? People should part in the road when he drives, people should talk so much, women are out there to serve him, here's a shopping list, okay.

DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Let me ask you something unusual.

DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Let me ask you something a bit unusual. 

01:09:00
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM What prevents you from doing that? 

01:09:05
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay, so, I say to him, "Richard," biggie question coming out. This is not a throw away, okay. "Richard, let me ask you something a bit different." I lean over and get into his apperceptive mass, "What prevents you from doing that?" Remember, the best predictor of suicidality is not level of depression, it's level of hopelessness. So, one of the reasons for staying alive-- let's listen to his answer. What prevents you from doing that?

RICHARD Ah, that the people I'll leave behind will think I'm weak, that there are people that care about me, - 

01:10:10
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Uh-hmm. 

01:10:15
RICHARD - they've told me this - 

01:10:15
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Uh-hmm. 

01:10:20
RICHARD - and I don't want to leave this world that way. 

01:10:25
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Note that like a good cognitive behavior therapist, I do not challenge the data for positive thoughts. I don't lean over to him and say, "Richard, people care." "Name two." I mean, "H-- how do you know they really care?" "Maybe they know about the guns and they're afraid to tell you what they really think about you, huh! Huh! Huh! Possibility? Huh, huh!" The notion that he has that people care, that he just don't wanna appear weak becomes relevant. 

01:11:00
[sil.] 

01:11:10
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM I wouldn't you to leave that way either. I mean, even though you are lonely, it sounds like you're not alone, that people do care. 

01:11:25

01:11:30
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM You've been through an awful lot and you had a situation of a marriage break up, changing of the job, there may be even other stresses in your life that are all coming together at this time. And I am seeing that some of the reaction that you're having and the depression, the sadness, the feeling of hopelessness and at times even helplessness may, in some sense, even be a natural reaction to what you've been through. I mean, that doesn't make it have less of an impact. But on the other hand, I, I, I feel a kind of-- how shall I put it? Ah, a real desire to live, a sense of realizing new potential of, of wanting to change. 

01:12:30
RICHARD Yes, that's very true. 

01:12:35
DR. DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay, before I get to the last guy who is quite interesting as well, it's interesting to note that Richard grew up in a home where there was domestic violence, he was exposed there, he couldn't bring home friends. Not only that, his father told him that he will grow up and make a mess of his life and even in his death it will be needing untidy. One last guy to listen to and then we'll talk about how do you treat folks like this. This is a chap who we cannot film, okay, but you could show it here, okay.
