JACK CATLIN My name is Jack. My wife Betsy of 60 years. She died umm… about three months ago after a very, very long illness, actually caused by two different things. She had a neuropathy that is very, very rare and she also had COPD. I've been her caregiver for the last 15 years, but the most intense time is the last five years when we were dealing with COPD.

Mother and Mother-In-Law Died 3 Years Ago 

00:01:35

The Transforming Power of Caregiving 

00:01:55
Returning to Life After Caregiving Ends 

00:01:55
A New Beginning 

00:02:00
JACK CATLIN The only job I've had over the last 15 years is to take care of Betsy. I didn't have another job. But I've been… I was retired prior to that. And that was… when I was supposed to do with, with my life during the times she was going down ill. So I did. I, I was at the hospital with her from anywhere around 10 o'clock in the morning till 7, 8 o'clock at night every day. When she died, it was over. And suddenly I was out of a job and I, it was a fulltime job and it was sometimes very difficult and it was very emotional umm… But as suddenly it was no longer there and my services were no longer needed. 

00:02:45
[music] 

00:02:50
JACK CATLIN It was a lonely feeling. It was a, you know, what do I do now kind of a feeling. 

00:02:55
NARRATOR There is a natural sense of loss when the need for our caregiving is over, we face the grief of the death of our loved one as well as the loss of our purpose and role in life. The aftermath can be a very difficult time that leaves us feeling lost, lonely, and useless. 

00:03:15
TOM GRANDY Landing up in her bedroom, sleeping in her bed, that was the toughest, because she was, she was downstairs here uh… in her final months. I was upstairs, always had the door open, but more often or not I'd like lying on the couch for the night or something or other… And some of the aches that I had coming in here, you know, with telling me, you know, I, not to do that. You know, she's not going to go anywhere you know, and, and you are not to be on the couch or something. Be up in your room, leave the door open, you know, but I… There were times that I, you know, would umm… wake up and I go, "how did I get in this room, you know, again, you know, because I spent so much time in that room." You know, coming up and down. And, and that was, that was probably the toughest, the reality that she was gone. 

00:04:15
SONJA BREWER Care giving for me was total occupation. It took all of my time umm… I actually came across a telephone book that I had, a little address book that I had used at the time and it was so full of doctor names, nurses, social workers, the V.N.A. visiting nurses, elder services umm… agencies, hospitals, when he was finally admitted to long-term care, I had the names of 10 nurses, I had volunteer names, the social worker, the list goes on and on and that was my world, it wasn't just make some ice tea and sit down and enjoy the afternoon and occupy his time, it was a total occupation. And so the hardest thing was the kind of the quiet that ensued after he passed away, umm… the lack of stress, lack of daily planning and worry and phone calls and communications. 

00:05:20
[sil.] 

00:05:25
PATRICIA COLLINS Once we got through umm… all of the affairs that have to be attended to after the passing's, and right down to the thank you notes and the cleaning out the closets and the distributing all the, the property umm… we really kind of just sat there and said what's next, what do we do now? And so many things that we may have been interested in before like going to a movie, it wasn't interested. Umm… having friends over was too much work I acknowledge, exhaustion because I know there was a period of time when the T.V. was on a lot, which we didn't watch television. The television was on quite a bit umm… There wasn't… We didn't have a lot of conversation because, now I'm just thinking about that. That was something between, particularly my husband and I that, casual conversation, our conversations had always been about, okay what's up with Murray, what's up with Mary, have you been in touch with this one, have you been in touch with that one, and as in aside my husband's sister was also very, very ill and he was the front man for her care needs, although she was in assisted living and but he was the point person for her care needs. Our conversations were about them and I just realized that. So that art of intimate conversation and I can remember, we went to a restaurant and no sooner had we sat down for dinner, then he brought up his mother. And I said I'm not, not having this conversation. We could not get through a meal without talking about one of them. 

00:07:10
Your passion for giving and energy for life 

00:07:15
will be suspended in air 

00:07:20
Your emotions will be up and down 

00:07:20
until that passion and energy are redirected 

00:07:30
NARRATOR The first step after caregiving ends, is to acknowledge our grief and that sometimes complicated feelings that we may have after the death of our loved one. Grief is a natural process. In the beginning when your grief is raw, it may feel overwhelmingly painful. 

00:07:50
PATRICIA COLLINS I couldn't go visit my best friend anymore. My mother became my best friend. And whenever I was having a tough day, she's, where I went to be comforted and to have a good laugh. So she wasn't there anymore. 

00:08:05
JACK CATLIN Grief uh… is normal and natural. And I don't think uh… there's wisdom in trying to block it when it comes, when you feel it umm… Staying busy uh… doesn't cement you into feeling it all the time umm… but things happen, like you'll see something on television and one of the programs that you watch, you know, tears will come. The grief is spontaneous, it just comes. And I don't do anything to stop it, because it's important, I feel it and get past it. 

00:08:45
SONJA BREWER After David died umm… the first couple of weeks I couldn't take a deep breath literally and I think other people have felt that, light-chested you can't take a deep breath because you really can't believe that you've suffered this loss, that it's really happened. And during the first several months I would not cry very often but it would strike me in the oddest places, in the cereal aisle at the grocery store, such that I had to walk out of the grocery store because I couldn't, I couldn't be in front of a cashier with the tears coming down my face. Things that I miss doing with David. Just having him in my life, it was so empty and so quiet umm… the emptiness was really the hardest part of it, because not just grieving the loss of a loved one, I think when you're a caregiver you are responsible for the life of another person totally. You really have lost a big control factor in your life. There's nothing right in front of you that you need to control like driving a car and you feel that loss of control very keenly. 

00:10:05
NARRATOR It is possible that we'll feel relief that we don't have to work so hard any longer and then feel a sense of guilt for feeling such relief. 

00:10:15
JACK CATLIN It was a relief because it was intense, the caregiving was intense. And uh… it left me feeling… Well, what do I do now? You know, what, because at that time I didn't know what I was going to do for, to keep busy. Umm… So I felt kind of, like a ship at sea without an anchor. 

00:10:45
TOM GRANDY I was really angry at myself you know, umm… when she passed because I want… As much as you don't want to see her go, you know, you're hoping, let's ends this suffering for her. But also you're ending it for yourselves too. I mean there is a breaking point, you know, where this comes into you head. I hated myself for thinking about it, but I would also say in the other hand, "I know that she wanted to go." That's the one thing that, that really kept in my mind for a while… about the fact that she… It was a relief, you know, because it was such a strain. 

00:11:30
There are natural feelings that you will need to allow yourself to feel 

00:11:35
Your daily routine will change 

00:11:40
You are exhausted and will need to rest and become renewed 

00:11:45
Feeling a sense of relief from the suffering for you and your loved one is normal and natural 

00:11:55
NARRATOR Along with our grief, we may have feelings of anger, regret, resentment, loneliness, and whatever else we may feel. All of these are natural reactions and it is important to express and acknowledge them. 

00:12:10
JACK CATLIN Towards the end, she was aware of, of where she was physically and emotionally. She wanted very much to come home to die. The doctor for the hospital that she were, she was… He said you're so frail, the chances are you wouldn't arrive home alive. And I was sorry that I didn't recognize how, just how frail she'd gotten. So I didn't do anything about getting her home early enough to have it be any… and become a reality for her, so I feel a lot of regret about that. 

00:12:55
SONJA BREWER I do have one regret and it really has come out of learning more about this illness, Alzheimer's disease and learning about people with dementia. My regret is that I did not put my arms around David enough. I wish I had done that. That, I think, I still think about that today. But the opposite of regret is that, I've learned so much, you know, I've really learned umm… I have such a deep appreciation for other caregivers. 

00:13:25
PATRICIA COLLINS I think that my children, my children grew up with it and I have a slight sense with my son that he made during his teens felt early teens, teens felt, I was there for grammy, more than I was for him. 

00:13:40
TOM GRANDY In this case I'm going, you know, why her, you know? At this age, I, you know, I never figured 

00:13:55
PATRICIA COLLINS I have my husband, my, my work, my kids, our mothers. In retrospect I think our mothers came number, we're number one. We didn't even realize it at the time, until after they passed. But if I had for instance, our daughter had a soccer game on a Saturday morning, I had a factor that in to my mother and my mother in law's needs for that day. It wasn't, I'll go to the soccer game and then figure out. And I missed a lot of them. 

00:14:30
SONJA BREWER I had let seven years of my life go by. I was able to turn that resentment around but it wasn't until after I went through a bit of a mid-life crisis of… This is not what I was supposed to accomplish in my life. This particular decade was so important to what I needed to accomplish and it's out of my hands and there's nothing I can do about it. Umm… so now where do I go from here? What do I do? 

00:14:55
TOM GRANDY Did I do enough? You know, maybe I should have done. I will do that, you know, and I catch myself doing that, and say this is not… No, don't do that to yourself, you know, and she wouldn't want that either. 

00:15:10
PATRICIA COLLINS One very sad aspect is, if there's discord in the family and that's not dealt with while the person is still living, then I think that that carries a lot of pain and suffering after that person passes, because whatever the failings might have been, there's just, there has to be forgiveness and settlement, not for the benefit of the person who's dying but for the benefit of the survivor. 

00:15:40
Your many feelings are natural and normal as you realize your grief 

00:15:45
You may have regrets, resentments, loneliness, relief 

00:15:50
Embrace your feelings: this will you to let them go 

00:16:00
[music] 

00:16:05
NARRATOR There is no set timeline for grieving. And unfortunately, you may never completely get over your loss, you will eventually feel better give yourself time. 

00:16:15
JACK CATLIN A couple of things that people have said and I knew anyway I think was, that you have to keep yourself busy. You have to keep your mind off your grief. Even though you are going to have grief uh… you have to let the grief through, but you also have to be very busy with, with constructive work that was meaningful. And I tried to live in the now, today, not in the past, not in the future. The knowledge of that she's gone to heaven and she's with the maker now, is probably the most important moment uh… thought I have to help with this situation. 

00:17:05
SONJA BREWER My biggest advice is not to let go of your support systems, whatever they are. And in a lot of cases after caregiving, you don't have the same support systems you had before caregiving. A lot of friends and family members turn to dwindle away, umm… but whatever you have, whether it's a church or a support group, or you're starting with a grievance group, anything like that, you need to keep it up. 

00:17:30
JACK CATLIN The things that you need to do, is keep your mind occupied with something that's important umm… to you, work or a hobby or something that you can put yourself into uh… and not to dwell on the situation. 

00:17:50
SONJA BREWER Walking, swimming, biking, keeping busy, reading, keep yourself totally occupied. It's the most healing part of, of the process is to simply stay totally focused on whatever is right in front of you and that's really the way caregiving happens is, everyday you're so focused on your activities for the days, you wanna kind of repeat that and keep it going for at least about a year umm… until you can live with a lot of empty spaces that you couldn't, you didn't even know about before because you're so busy. 

00:18:25
Keep yourself busy with constructive work 

00:18:30
Try to live in the now, not in the past, not in the future 

00:18:35
Draw comfort from your faith 

00:18:40
Keep in contact with your support system 

00:18:45
[sil.] 

00:18:55
NARRATOR Another important step to take after caregiving ends, is to acknowledge your physical condition. Perhaps during caregiving, you felt, you did not have the time to go to the doctor or schedule a necessary appointment, just as your soul needs time to heal, you know that your body will need time too. 

00:19:10
[music] 

00:19:15
JACK CATLIN During that time that I was… the caregiver umm…, I was experiencing more and more trouble with my, my right knee… arthritis, I was told. Umm… but I didn't want to begin any kind of major treatment for it, uh… that would take me away from her. Uh… whatever the care I was giving her. I'm in the process of getting a replacement knee, but I have to install so to speak. The experience was sacrificing. Actually I'm sacrificing my knee for her, for her care and I'm happy with that. 

00:20:00
PATRICIA COLLINS Within a month of my mothers passing, umm… and she passed second. I went on a diet, I lost about 30 pounds and I started taking Pilates and walking. So, yes, those were things that I had not done for a number of years. I'm too tired, just too down tired and mentally, I just want to go to bed, that was it. 

00:20:25
SONJA BREWER When David passed away, I had a series of… Oh, bronchitis and flu and pneumonia, actually a couple of times. I couldn't get free of things that were respiratory problems that were plaguing me that I had not experienced at all while caring for him. And in a odd way I feel like it all just was delayed until he passed and then suddenly I couldn't get well again. And the other thing that happened was, I had some serious skin surgeries for skin cancer and those had to be done in Boston. So a couple of them occurred while I was caring for David and of course stress does have an impact on our skin cancer condition. So I was my own worst enemy and I knew it, umm… but I had to have my daughters come and I would drive David up to Boston with me and then they would come in to the doc surgeons offices and one would stay with me and one with him, and that's how we got through that, because he ran out of options, there's just no other options. And after he passed away, it was only another month or two when I had to have another major surgery, right after he passed away. So these things effect you so much and having been that person, I can relate totally to the people who I work with in the support groups. So I always advice them to please, please don't just, you know, "take care of yourself," go to your doctor, get your conditions checked out, make sure that you're well because you cannot take care of another person unless you're a well person. 

00:22:10
Your physical needs were sacrificed 

00:22:15
You need to care for yourself 

00:22:20
Exercise and eat well 

00:22:20
Go to your doctor 

00:22:25
[sil.] 

00:22:30
A New Normal 

00:22:35
NARRATOR Part of the experience of life after caregiving is to find a New Normal. What kind of future do we have without our loved one? Just as you found your way during the caregiving experience, you will find your way in life after caregiving. 

00:22:50
JACK CATLIN I didn't know what I was going to do with myself. I didn't know. And I think of that because we sometimes make… What we do uh… measure of, how acceptable we are, uh… then that left me feeling of quite unacceptable at those moments, which only lasted a week or two, umm… till the things that I was going to end up doing, started to gel and since then I don't feel that concerned anymore. 

00:23:25
PATRICIA COLLINS Refocusing, it really was. It was refocusing. Umm… going back, we have been active very active socially and that had gone by the wayside. We used to entertain a lot. We hadn't done that in years. There are some people we still haven't reconnected with, uh… it's taken quite a long time to really settle back and say, "oh, I'm liberated! Which I don't mean it's sound, like I'm a (inaudible ) or anything, but I'm free, I'm liberated. And my husband, his primary focus was his mom, my primary focus was my mom. We shared focus on our children but we had a comeback together. We had a comeback together to find something we could focus on together. 

00:24:20
SONJA BREWER When you're living with a terminal illness, you stop planning for the future. And so I stopped planning for me, as well as for him. Umm… and what I realized after caregiving ended was that I needed to get back in the mode of planning my life, umm… events, things that happen in the future. Umm… you know, we're going to the melody one time this year and its just a nice little events and I look forward to it every year. And we don't spend a lot of money on entertainment, but that's just a little marker for the summer. And I enjoy it and I thing about it. Umm… we'll have a week in my cottage and that's a nice thing to look forward to. Umm… this winter, you know, maybe we need to plan a couple of repairs to the house or something like that. Planning was something that was so foreign to me as a caregiver and now its back to plan, normal planning in my life. It's a normal part of life again and it's a really good part of life because you're not dwelling on the past and you're not so focused on the present, so that you are able to plan for tomorrow, so really important change. 

00:25:40
JACK CATLIN In this stage I have work I can do that benefits the place I live and the people I know here. Uh… and I'm also doing something that working with my hands uh… in a wood carving situation, that is very meaningful and that has, has helped enormously to keep my mind where it needs to be. 

00:26:10
TOM GRANDY Gradually, umm… you start getting back slowly. Every year they would have a annual St. Patrick's Day Parade out here and that would bring leisure and our friends would come too. And I got a call from them and said, "St. Patrick's day is coming up." I said I'm not gonna go. Oh, yes, you are. You know, you are going. We're gonna do it for lease, so, but I went umm… and, you know, uh… it, it was different but, you know, it was good to get out, you know, to breathe a bit, you know, and that's sort of lit the little fuse, gradually, slowly, you start getting back. 

00:27:05
PATRICIA COLLINS The amount of time that we had for them was now empty air, it was empty air and we didn't know how to fill it. It was, it was interesting. I'm not sure three years later we still have learnt how to fill that time. 

00:27:25
TOM GRANDY And I got a daughter that's getting married and I'm trying to, you know, what can I (inaudible ) I think and you know, what would she do in this case 'cause, I'm sort of taken over a mummy role in part. I'm not a very good mummy. A lot of things that she would make decisions on, I'm making them now, you know, so, but that's good, because, you know you feel like you worth something, you know, and gradually over a period of time, uh… they would still very different and at times very umm… hollow. Nevertheless I had a lot of good friends and getting me going and relatives as well, you know, and my children certainly. 

00:28:10
You may feel unacceptable because you're not taking care of your loved one 

00:28:15
Take time to settle back and be free to refocus on your life 

00:28:25
Get back into planning your life 

00:28:30
Get out, breathe a bit, get involved again with friends and family 

00:28:40
[sil.] 

00:28:45
NARRATOR Many factors go into the development of new identity after the death of a loved one. The work is demanding and can be scary as you attempt to assume certain responsibilities for the first time. It is okay to feel inadequate, even overwhelmed, and to ask for help for others in facing the unfamiliar. 

00:29:05
JACK CATLIN Betsy was my best friend in life. And others are going to loose people like that, who are that to them. And uh… But I've been more aware of the lord in this period of time after she left. I depended a lot on her for her help and her viewpoints on things, which I don't have from anyone as close to me as before anymore. So I think I gravitate naturally toward the, the vertical view that I used to before I had to stop taking care of her. 

00:30:00
PATRICIA COLLINS I've got a lot of support groups and it is for people who are active caregivers and interestingly enough those caregivers bond during the period of time that they were in that support group because they are sharing something that nobody else can understand but each other, not only they can understand it. And what's wonderful is, as though support groups… As we had members who lost their loved one, they continued to come to the support group. We had one woman, I was with her when her husband passed and umm… we had a support group about… It was about eight days later and she showed up and we were surprised to see. I knew she was coming. We were surprised to see her so soon afterwards and she said this is where I have to be, because this is where she is understood, that is the group even though… They were those who had lost their partners, who are still coming. And those who anticipated what, that loss was going to be like for themselves and that bond is really, really important. And I know from caregivers that, that keeps them afloat, I know it does. 

00:31:10
SONJA BREWER I work with a number of people who have been caregivers in the past or who are caregivers right now, both as a shine counselor and in my role as a support group leader and really an advocate for caregivers in many ways. I run a lot of book discussion groups and library groups and things like that. So I'm constantly interacting with people who have been through this experience. Umm… the people I fear for if you will, are those people who can't get past the loss. It's not just the loss of their loved one, it's that absence of caregiving and that passion that you develop as an advocate for someone else. And when that is wiped obviously and you're alone. Sometimes it can be almost impossible to get over it. somebody like that and I do know somebody who's in that situation right now, really need some professional help, really need some individual counseling, working with a grief counselor, working with a mental health counselor, it's so important to get your feet back under you. Umm… but it is a passionate undertaking and it can't be underestimated how, uh… how it impacts you as a person. Umm… your life is, is not the life of a caregiver anymore. But what is your life? You have to redevelop your life. So umm… I would just caution the caregivers out there who are in the situation that, if you really feel like you're not getting up in the morning, that you can't get past your grief, you really need to reach out and get some help. 

00:32:45
PATRICIA COLLINS I think we're too hard on ourselves. I once had a very dear friend say that she felt, she actually experienced post-traumatic stress. And we, even though she cared for her mom at home, and my mom was in assisted and then skilled living, skilled assistance umm… It is, again it's so intense, it becomes, it's, becomes part of your core. You just have to suppress so much that, afterwards suddenly you realize, oh, my gosh, I'm worn-out, I'm burdened with sadness. And you have to… I really believe go to your faith. You really have to excuse yourself from feeling that way. I'm so fortunate. I don't feel guilty. 

00:33:40
JACK CATLIN It was a big change, a big life change, no question uh… and still is. But I found that it's going okay, it's all right. 

00:33:55
SONJA BREWER Don't think that, you know, that, at the point you are in your life, that, that's your life. You have a lot more living to do and you just have to let a little bit of time pass and things will happen. 

00:34:05
TOM GRANDY You just can't sit around a mope, life goes on. 

00:34:10
Finding your own identity takes time 

00:34:15
Your faith and your support group will help you understand this phase of healing 

00:34:20
Bonds of understanding are important 

00:34:25
Seek out professional help for complicated grief 

00:34:30
This will not be your life forever, life goes on 

00:34:40
[music] 

00:34:45
New Life Discoveries 

00:34:50
NARRATOR As we walk through the process of beginning to rebuild our lives after caregiving ends, we find that our own life may turn out to be completely different, new, interesting, even exciting. 

00:35:00
JACK CATLIN Interesting, but I like what I'm doing. I'm doing two different things and I like them both. Uh… so umm… but I also apply myself to the more meaningful way I think because uh… it is important and I do so. I'm always aware of living in the now and the things that I do are in the now, so I may try to maintain that as much as I can. 

00:35:35
SONJA BREWER More different than I could possibly have imagined. I moved from Cape Cod to be with my current significant other who is Alan and I live in Middleborough and it's about an hour away from where I used to live and I never thought I would do that. I really never conceived of leaving Cape Cod, umm… but I love it here. It's wide open country, we go for country drives, we go to the ocean, it's, it's really a beautiful place. Umm… and I'm with Alan and I never thought I would be in another relationship really. I thought after 37 years of marriage umm… really, any other romantic relationship was not in my future and it turned out to be in my future and so it's a wonderful thing. And I also gave up my job. I, I, you know… There's some resentment built into having to be a total fulltime caregiver. And part of my resentment along the way I think was that I had to basically give up what I really loved doing. And so I had to re-find myself with regard to a career and I moved out of human resources and into human services and very happy to be in human services and I'm still working part time.

PATRICIA COLLINS I'm very, very happy. I think about my mother all the time, especially now that I'm working in the place where my mom resided once she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and incidentally where my mother-in-law also resided at the end of her life. She passed away at, at Atria very, very peaceful kind death. Umm… I just, I just feel so blessed to have had the opportunity to have my mother teach me what she did about people with dementia, so that I can now bring in to my current work environment. I really do as I've said… I do believe it's a gift from God that he passed to me through my mother.

SONJA BREWER For me it's been six and a half years since caregiving ended, since I lost David. So I've had a lot of time in between to basically rebuild my life, that's very different now than it used to be. But you know, I took my own advice, so I did stay busy. I play the cello and I was in a community orchestra and I had lots of friends in the orchestra and so I stayed in touch with them and stayed playing my cello. Umm… I was working. I went back to work almost full time, so that occupied quite a bit of my time. I still had my animals, my dog and my two cats so umm… they, they were also my best buddies for a long time. Umm… and as time evolved and I met Alan and we decided to move to Middleborough, of course that took up a whole another set of time. Umm… I was commuting back to the Cape and I ended up changing my job from the Shine Director, I became the Smile Director and that was working from home. And so I work here from home, uh… or I did work in this job for over a year and it's a dental program for seniors. So I was very much aligned you know with the Shine program which works with this senior centers. So I stayed very active working in the same community of people that I had been working with before. And I think that kind of grease the wheels for me. It, it kept me comfortable. Umm… I didn't have to… I was making major changes but they were not so very different from my previous life and I think that was important. I don't play in an orchestra anymore and I've only recently taken up my cello again, which is kind of interesting. It's, it's been now probably four years since I played in an orchestra. Umm… but I always felt I would play my cello again and I've continue to write and a lot of, what I'm writing now oddly enough is poems. I'm writing poems for caregivers and, and incorporating them into the new little booklet that I'm writing for caregivers. I'm blessed to have four grand children, three of whom David never knew. My oldest grandson is now turning 18 and David knew him, umm… but he didn't know the three grand girls. So that takes up a fair amount of time in addition to being a support group leader and working with caregivers and still writing. And I guess I would have to say that I'm very peaceful with how my life has turned out now. I do think I am a totally different person than I would ever have thought. 

00:40:35
TOM GRANDY Excuse me Mag. My life today is umm… certainly not as chaotic. It's a chaotic life now of a positive nature, you know, in that, I work part time. I keep myself busy but obviously there are moments of uh… When she normally would be, there is not that, you know, eating with you and watching T.V. with you and that type of stuff. You know, that… I don't know if that will ever go away. I mean, there's these woppy moments, uh… and, and thoughts and this is from time to time. You know I get into a weep moment, but for the most part, uh… the changes have been, you know, pretty much back to normal. One of the nice things is that, he's only umm… a thousand steps from my house. So I get to go down there. You know, when I need to, you know umm… Initially I was going down almost every day and somebody say, you can't be doing that, you know… And gradually I go see it two or three times a month down there… bring in the flowers and stuff, she was very much into flowers. 

00:42:00
It will be important to apply yourself and live in the now 

00:42:05
Your life may be totally different 

00:42:10
Embrace the blessings of your new life 

00:42:15
Keep open for new options to unfold in your life

NARRATOR The caregiving role was an important part of our journey in life, just as important is the journey of finding new life today and looking toward the future. 

00:42:40
PATRICIA COLLINS Far more compassionate, far more understanding, I am far more aware of… how much goodness there is in the world and how much love there is in the world. And it has, it has, had an incredible impact upon my faith, my belief in God, incredible impact. 

00:43:05
SONJA BREWER A couple of things I learned along the way. I learned, of course, that life is precarious that, uh…in the best of circumstances, the worst can happen. I didn't think of myself as a nurturing person at all. Umm… so I didn't have a lot of confidence as a caregiver for the first several years of caregiving, umm… but I learned how to be nurturing caregiver. And I think in the end I was a very nurturing caregiver and that surprised me because it's another side of me that I wasn't, I wasn't really introduced to before. 

00:43:40
JACK CATLIN I learned how to take care of somebody for more, I have more empathy for people who are sick and people who are older and sick. I understand much better, the position they are in and how difficult that must be. 

00:43:55
TOM GRANDY It shows what you can do, you know. I mean, I had for years going. What I'm I gonna do? What I'm gonna do, you know, when she gets to the stage? It's amazing how you can adapt. Once you put your mind to it, you know, once you, you say to yourself you know, I mean, this is part of the deal and say everything was going to be rosy. 

00:44:20
SONJA BREWER I think my experience in caregiving helped me know that I could do pretty much anything, that I wanted to do. And umm… I think I accomplish more as a caregiver doing very odd things like electrical repairs, plumbing repairs, things that I never would have thought I could do. Umm… so now I'm a little bit fearless. So I, I figure if I really study it and figure it out, I'll, I'll know how to do it. So it's given me, actually more confidence in, in all aspects of my life.
