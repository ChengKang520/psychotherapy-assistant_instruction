PATRICIA ROBEY Hi, I'm Dr. Patricia Robey, and I'm Associate Professor at Governor's State University. I'm here today to talk about counseling theories, an area in which I find a lot of excitement and energy, so I hope you will, too. And I'm glad to be here with you to share about theories. For most of you, probably the idea of theories when you thought about taking the class, you thought, oh, my goodness, what is this? It looks dry, it looks boring. And I have to admit that when I first took my theories course, I thought about that, too. And an interesting thing though is, once I started to work with the theories a little bit and start to think about them in a different way, I found a lot of enthusiasm of four theories and four the way that they can apply to my life and to your life. One of the things that was interesting to me about the whole field of psychology in counseling and theories in particular is something that my mom said to me way back when my mom was an accountant and she went and took a psychology course just for personal interest. And so she said, I'll never take another one again because when I did that, I started to look at people differently. And as you can imagine, when you start to think about people from a psychological counseling perspective, you do start to think differently about what is going on with them. And the thing that was interesting to me about it as I realized how powerful these could be is the idea that, first of all, I found myself to be fascinating with through them, but I also find others to be fascinating. So as I think about them through the theories, this is where theory really comes alive. Now, the interesting thing about theory is that we all have them, you know, we're not in a book, but we do know certain things about them because you make theoretical assumptions about things in your life every single day, based on what you know and what you hope to find out. So, for example, as you're going into class with a new professor, you might theories about the nature of that professor and you would know about that based on the things that you've heard from other students, you might be thinking about that from what your ideal professor would be, you might have a wish for what that professor would be like, but you do have an idea of what you might expect when you go into a professor's classroom. Now you can also think about, well, my… I'm going to theories about how I'm going to be successful in this class. So based on what I know about this professor, what do I need to do to be successful? And you can experiment with that and you can think, well, okay, if I know this professor, what I know that I need to do to be successful is to write my journals, put my working on time, read every week before I go into class and on so. So the thing about theory is that, you can also experiment with that. So you could experiment with the professor and you could write in your journal something that would be really outlandish to see if the professor actually read your journal. So that's one thing about theories is that you do look at them, you can hypothesis, you can experiment, but I would encourage you not to necessarily experiment in that way that could get you in big trouble, but this is where theory can be personalized, it where it really becomes interesting. Okay, so what is the theory anyway? So a theory is an idea or a set of ideas that's intended to explain phenomenon, facts or events that can be used to predict the future or can explain or guide action. So that's what I was just taking about. So when you think about your professors and you think about what are they likely to do, what's likely to happen, you can theorize about that. And so that's how that comes into play. Now the thing about theory that's interesting is that, it's presented as if it is true. So anytime you open the book and you read about the theories, you see that umm… Freud thought his was true, Alder thought his was true, everyone thinks that their theory is true, but the truth of the matter is that it can't be proven to be so. So, for example, no one can crack open a brain or human being and find an Id, an ego and a super-ego. And if you're Glasserian like I am, you can't look on a DNA strand and find evidence to support the fact that Glasser says, needs are genetically driven. We don't see that on a DNA strand. Therefore, theories can't be proven to be true, but they can be proven to be false. So, for example, if we went back into the DNA and we identified every single thing in a DNA strand and we never found any evidence of basic needs, we would prove that Dr. Glasser's hypothesis about DNA… or basic needs being genetically driven would be false.

PATRICIA ROBEY Okay. So here is something that's really interesting is how theory is developed? And this is the same as I was telling you, you can develop your own because theory is developed based on observations from everyday life from objective facts, previous knowledge, and personal or professional practice. Counseling theory is based on observations or patterns of human behavior. So as an example of that, I want to talk about Alfred Adler. Now you probably have heard about Alfred, Alfred Adler. He developed the individual psychology approach. And here is what's interesting about looking at him in the context of theory. When Adler was born, he was very sickly child, he was unattractive, he was small and he… That created a lot of inner problems for him. And he also had an older brother and he had difficulty and jealously with his older brother. So if you think about Adlerian physiology, you can think about, huh, Alder talked about inferiority complex. He talked about birth order. And how, you could see how that early experience of who he saw himself and who he was, lead for the way that he created his own worldview. And then, how he put them into action in his theory. So he then took that information that he knew and he overcame his early struggles. He actually went to medical school, he become an MD in ophthalmology. And then he became interested in social interest, in social reform, the way that families work and all of this comes out of his early learning about himself, what he observed, how he understood what was going on and so he developed Adlerian theory as a result of that. And it's one of our earliest theories and it has a lot of relevance today because he was also interested in how people work within relationships, just like he did and social justice, family systems and so on. So it's very relevant from when he designed it to today. So that's just one example of how a theorist developed his way of thinking out of his own lifestyle and that's an another Adlerian approach, but the other that you might think about is Carl Rogers who, you know, of course talked about humanistic counseling, person centered counseling and Carl Rogers came out of a family that was deeply religious, he at one point wanted to be a minister himself. And so, those qualities of ministry of behavior in a helping profession developed out of the way of thinking that he had that was related also to his own sense of connectedness and religion. And so as you know he developed the person centered or client centered approach to counseling.

PATRICIA ROBEY So counseling has developed over the course of time and it's changed to depending on what's going on socially, what's happening in the world because the world events shape a person's experience, shape how they think, shape what they do, shape how they interact and so on. And in counseling, we call that the forces of theoretical perspectives and the forces just mean the trends, the trends in counseling. So you can see the first force is the psychoanalytic force which includes Freud, Carl Jung, Adler and the rest of the cohorts in that time who were working from that idea. Now psychodynamic theories focus on inner forces, right? So the idea is of the unconscious, the influence that umm… our inner sources of our past experiences and so on influence who we are today. And works from the unconscious and it works on past experiences. So if you are working from a psychodynamic perspective, you would know, you would go into the past, you would spend a lot of time talking about that and then you would look at those experiences and how they works with your clients. Now then this… All the theories evolve over the course of time. So, for example, for, from psychodynamic, there is actually a new way of looking at psychodynamic counseling which is interpersonal, it's also associated with attachment disorders and attachment theory and with object relations theory. So the second force is cognitive behavioral. So you probably know a lot about this, you have experienced people using behavioral techniques and ever sense you were a little child in school. The idea that from a behaviors perspective that we are looked at and our behavior is assessed similarly to the way that we look at any animal. The idea is that we have inborn traits, inborn instincts, as well as the things that we, we learn through our external experiences and through rewarding punishment. And one of the primary people who was involved in that, of course, was skinners. And so along with that thought came the idea from some other theories, even Skinner, believe that there was a cognitive element to it, but over the course of time, the idea of cognition and the influence of the mind and how we think on our behaviors than created the movement toward cognitive behavioral approaches which are very… umm… one of the strongest used approaches these days, a cognitive behavioral approaches partly because they can be measured, they can be tested because of the behavioral component. So that provides some support for them to be used and especially in the field of managed care where they want to look an evidence based practice. Now some of the leading figures in the cognitive behavioral movement are Albert Ellis, Aaron Beck, Donald Meichenbaum and William Glasser. So here is another thing with the existential humanistic approach that is interesting in terms of its relationship to world events. The existential approach is an ancient approach, but from a counseling perspective, it really started to come into play following World War II. And these were developed in Europe. So to kind of keep those in mind umm… and you think about what was happening in that time that would have led to existential thinking. So coming out of a war that was based on economics, but also on who you were, what you did and racism, those kind of elements and keeping a cultural group confined and tortured all the things that happened then, what came out of that for some people was the idea of now that we're through this, how are we going to create, create meaning in our lives. And that's the existential piece. The idea for meaning, for self-actualization, for living authentically, and the idea of death and life, freedom and responsibility, all of those things are the significant pieces that came out of that existential movement. And when you think about that, if it were you, wouldn't you imagine that that would how you would be feeling and what you would want to do is to be able to rise up out of these terrible things that happen and begin to live the life that you were meant to leave. To me, that's such a powerful thing about the existential movement that people… And it shows people's resilience is what I really like about that. And then along with that came the humanistic approach. I mentioned already about Carl Rogers and his idea of people being able to become who they are through the interaction with somebody important in their lives. And that relates to councilor behavior is that most of us learn in our early counseling courses, the idea of being valued, the ideas of unconditional positive regard, the idea of authenticity, all of those things that are part of our daily language now. And so, the interesting thing about the third force here is that the existential humanistic fields have blended together to create something unique on their home and if you think about how they can work together. You can see that they are teamed up properly because being able to find you to resource, being able to be working toward finding or meaning through the therapist-client relationship is a key piece toward healing. So these are the first three forces in the developmental theory, but there are some limitations to those. One of the limitations is the dichotomy between an either or way of thinking. So there is umm… It's… You either have… You're operating from id, ego or super-ego, you are operating from umm… irrational thought, thoughts, you are operating from ineffective behaviors, there is a hierarchy of needs as opposed to looking at a larger picture. So… So when you think about these three, so there are some concerns about that. The other concern as you can imagine is the idea that cultural context isn't taking into consideration here, right? So there is a lot of things that may not meet the client where he or she is. So the theories that we ordinarily talk about are those that were developed by white male Europeans. And so, to look at that, then we think about, well, how are we going to work with cultures that are different like then that, how are we going to think about that. And so, then that comes into the forth force of counseling which is the multi-cultural and post-modern perspectives. And that is so wide open because now when people are thinking that way, lots and lots of theories have popped-up, when you looked at your theories back, there is maybe 13 to 15 different theories that are discussed, but the truth of the matter is, is that there is… I saw in one, one piece of research over 400 different theoretical approaches and especially when you start looking in this area of the multi-culture and postmodern perspectives because now what's happening is people are starting to look at clients at themselves in different ways depending on what their experience is. And it's exiting when you think about it to be able meet clients where they are. And to take a look at their context in the same way that I looked at Alder in his own context, right? So I would understand him in that way. And now when you have a client come in, you see them through their cultural approach. And the postmodern perspectives such as solution focus, narrative therapy, feminist theory, to some extent, family systems theory, all of those are also looking at the larger picture of what's going on with the client. Now we're looking at these as if this is absolutely separate because I talked about these limitations, but the truth of the matter is, is that most good counselors now will take this, this information into their own theoretically approaches even if it's from one of these other categories. So, for example, I work from a choice theory, reality therapy perspective, and the primary thing from my perspective is the importance of relationship. And so, of course, from the importance of relationship, if I'm going to have a good relationship with my clients, I better be thinking about them from a multi-cultural perspective because I don't know and that's the other thing, that's interesting about this way of thinking, it's coming from the non-expert, not knowing point of view. So going back to the psychodynamic and Freudian approach, remember Freud was the expert. He would do all the interpreting. When you come down here to this new way of thinking it's the client who was the expert and the job of the councilor then becomes to facilitate that process. It's kind of an existing way to work and it freeze us up also to think outside the box and the final thing that's interesting about this is that this is where the role of the councilor comes in to be also social justice person, a person who makes a difference in the world. We don't just sit in the office, we go out, we try to have influence and so on because the truth of the matter is, for councilors we need to be able to make a difference in the world through the actions that we choose. So finally, an emerging force in counseling in psychotherapy is neuroscience. Now I'm not an expert on neuroscience, it's kind of new, even if it were all, I don't know that I would be an expert on neuroscience, but what I do know is that it's the study of the nervous system, it comes from a branch of biology, but it's now looking, looked at as an interdisciplinary science because when you look at the biology of the nervous system and how it influences what goes on with the person holistically, you can see how it's an important thing to consider when working with clients. Now one other things that's interesting about neuroscience is that idea of neuroplasticity. And what that means is that synopsis in the brain can regenerate, you know, be umm… enhanced by different things that happened in the environment and one of those things that happened is when people are engaged in creative activities and so interestingly, one of those activities that are shown to increase the neuroplasticity is counseling in psychotherapy. And when… You can imagine that, can't you? Because when you think about that, then what happens is that as you're engaged and your creativity is popping, then you start to get that neuroplasticity working. And now I'm really talking as a lay person, you can hear, but the idea of it is very fascinating and for the people who are working in this field you could see where this maybe the next force in counseling theory as we think about how does that impact all the other things that we're already talking about. Okay. So, so what? This is where it comes down to, to you. So why is it important to have a counseling theory? And often when people come into councilor training and we ask why are you here, why, why do you want to be a councilor. People will say, well, my friends have told me that I give great advice and my friends say, I'm easy to talk to or people in this store stop and tell me their troubles I don't even know why. I must have that kind of outlook. So if it's just a natural thing, why do we need to have councilor theory, right? So the think about theory that's so fascinating is that it provides a lens through which we understand human behavior and motivation. So how cool is that? This is what I just was taking about, whatever theory you choose will help to guide the way that you're thinking about what's in front of you, and not only in the counseling office also. It also helps you to explain yourself, it helps you to explain your family and it helps you to explain your friends and gives you kind of a guideline to go and observe the world. Now, it will caution you, just like what my mother said. When you go to explain your friends and your family, you probably want to keep it yourself. I remember, when I was in, in school my family told me, don't do that counseling stuff on me because really who do you think you are, you are just my big sister, right? So I learned not to, not to be over zealous in the way that I was presenting my interest and how I thought people ticked. I just knew it. So… Again(ph), you're laughing, you know, exactly want I'm saying. So theory also provides a foundation for effective treatment practice. So when you know what is going on with your client, you can say if this is what the problem is, this is what needs to happen, my theory tells me and it also tells me what I need to do. And so it also in that same line provides a way to choose what's important in assessment, how to organize information. So if you're working from a postmodern perspective, for example, you're not going to choose to look at the past because from a postmodern perspective, what we want to do is work on the present and toward the future. And so, your theory guide in that. It says, what do you need to know, what do you want to find out, how are you going to organize that? So the other things is and we already talked about this. A little bit theory can help explain and predict behavior. So going back to the professor, once you know your theory and then of your counseling theory, not your personal theory, but once you know your counseling theory and you know that professor you can look at the professor and you go, "Oh! Now I know, now I can predict your behavior because I see what you've done and I can see now why my theory about you was wrong in the first place." Remember, they can be proven to be wrong. But once you can explain, how I understand how my professor works and I can predict the behavior from what I understand, it gives you a little bit of an edge, right? But the really cool thing I think and the most important thing is for you always to apply your theory to yourself. You do a disservice, if you use it only to apply to someone else. So it provides a format for case conceptualization. So it tells you what you need to do, it tells you what's going on, but here is kind of a critical piece that helps counselors get unstuck. So I find this is particularly true when I'm working with counselors in the beginning practical because in beginning practical, we're really looking to have them establish a relationship, use those basic counseling skills, which is all very good, but what happens is that very often the students feel like I don't really know what I'm doing, I'm using these skills, but I'm not sure why I'm doing when I'm doing and the word I'm stuck comes up over and over again. And rightfully so, because if you don't have some sort of guiding principle, it is very difficult to know what do I do once I've established that relationship? What do I understand? Where do I need to go from here? And this feeling of being stuck for beginning counselors especially is very difficult because they have in their minds and idea of wanting to be successful, wanting to feel confident and that difference between how they want to be and how they perceive themselves to be creates a lot of internal dissonance. So the cool thing is then, is that when they start to pick up on theory and they start to get a better idea about what they're doing with their client, this is what leads them to develop their own way of being and the competence that they are looking for, because it provides structure, it provides outline. And so, here at Governor State, we have two practica, the beginning of practicum, people come in. And I think theoretically, they're thinking through those basic counseling skills, and as we move across time and they start to add a theory to the work that they are doing at the end of the second practicum. Students are usually saying, wow, I really get it now, I know how to think, I know what to do and there the excitement is there and what's also really great is the feedback that they get from their clients is that you're doing this good work, I understand what you're doing and thank you. We hear a lot of thank you. I just ended a practicum course and that this is what they said, they were so excited because they knew what they were doing. And so, finally, uh, theory guides the technique and provides the structure to help evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic intervention. Well, because the theory says, this is what the outcome should be. So when you know what the outcome should be, then you can measure what am I seeing with my client compared to the ideal outcome based on my theory. And then you can measure it and you can ask the client to measure it. So when you came in, you wanted to have more relationships on a scale of 1 to 10 where were you? Where are you? So as simple as that or as profound as doing a research study. So theory is very important in that way. Now what you really want to know is choosing your theory. There are text books, text books, text books about theory. In a counseling department, you have a variety of professors who work from a variety of different ways. And so it's challenging. How do I understand? How do I know what's right from me. So the way to think about this is to consider your own worldview, beliefs, attitudes, values and behaviors about what constitutes change. So what do you believe, and 'cause it's really important to choose a theory that fits you. Okay, don't choose it just because why I like Dr. Robey and she just choice theory and reality therapy, so I'll be like her. If it doesn't suit you, it won't work for you. So here are some questions to ask yourself. Do you believe change occurs by working on gaining inside into past or through a focus on the present and future? So, right away, if you answer that question and you're a present and future-oriented person, you know, that you are not likely to go into the psychodynamic approaches, right? Then you want to know what is the role of the counselor? Is the counselor of the expert in the, in the process or does the counselor work as a facilitator guide an equal person in moving the process forward? So now the secret is, of course, we all want to feel like the experts, but our behaviors and our believes about that is what guides this. Do you believe the focus of the counseling should primarily be on behavior, thinking or feeling? So if you're interested in working with feelings, you might be more interested in working from a humanistic approach and if you're interested in behavior, you have behaviorism in his pears form or combination you might do a cognitive behavioral choice theory, REBT from Albert Ellis which incorporates behavioral thinking and feeling, so you have to think about what is my natural way of being. And one of the interesting things is about when you are working with your client, you begin to see through your work how you operate, because there is a way that you come through. And one of the challenges that I've seen with students is that they say, well, I would like to be this because I think that sounds really wonderful. And a lot of that is the humanistic kind of approaches which we naturally bring, but if every, all the work that you do is focusing on behavior and thinking, you know that there is an inconsistency between those things, so that's what you have to consider. Okay. So another way to think about this is to think of a time when you were successful in dealing with a problem, how did you do it? Did you think your way through it? Did you act your way through it? You know change your behaviors? Did you feel and experience the feeling until finally you had catharsis. Did you go into the past to think about what was going on in my past that lead me to where I am today or I have insight, okay, that's good enough. So these are some ways for you to identify your own personal perspective. You can also describe a person to whom you go with the problem. What are the characteristics you admire or respect or appreciate in that person? So that's kind of… When you think about it, that's kind of a good way, right? Because if that's what you like to receive, then maybe that shows what you'd like to put forward in your sessions. Finally, watch video demonstrations and master therapists in action. So when you think you know the direction that you are going to be going, it's a good idea to watch somebody do it who is the expert, and especially in some of the videos from the master, master therapists, therapy with the experts series, the therapist actually talks about what are the believes around this approach, does a demonstration and then talks about what happen in that demonstration. I mean, what a the great learning tool that is to be able to see those masters in action. Finally, I already mentioned this. You personalize your theories to see what fits. So when you go through the theories book or you think about as you are reading your specific theories book to talk about how do I understand this about myself? Do I believe really that I have all these defense mechanisms and their because of inner, inner experiences, if you're an Adlerian, do I look at my early life experiences and then say, oh, okay because of my basic mistakes in private logic, this is why I'm having problems in the present, or do you believe let's just start from now it doesn't worry whatever the problem is this is the real problem. This is the postmodern perspective and I'm going to work on that and if I work on that that everything else are just going to, it's going to be more likely to come into play because everything is connected to working on this one issue and if I'm happier here, I'll be likely to… Just to repel effect, right? I'll be likely to be happier. Okay. And so, that is the end of this particular piece about talking, about understanding theory and an overview. Obviously, there is a lot to theory that I haven't covered. But you can see that there is a richness to it and this is was just a way of helping you to understand how we come to theories in the first place, not to become an expert obviously on every single theory. So I hope you've enjoyed this little introduction and so now I'm ready to open it up to questions, if there are any. 

00:33:35
UNKNOWN I have a question. For counseling students or professionals who think that they can practice from a eclectic perspective, what do you say about that? 

00:33:45
PATRICIA ROBEY Well, that is something that comes up quite often, actually and… We'll talk a little… It's… The, the idea of eclectic often implies I'm not sure exactly where I stand. And so I'm picking and choosing from different perspectives. And to do that, requires significant knowledge of a lot of different theoretical approaches. And so, for a counselor who's been practicing a lot of time and has a lot of experience, it's a possibility that they could take those things and put them together into their own approach. On the other hand for beginning counselors and training to try to integrate a lot of different theory is more confusing than not. And I will say that most councilors and training want to do that because they don't want to choose. And I could see that because so many interesting things about so many theories. So in general, what we say to beginners is to choose the one that matches you the best and get to know it thoroughly, get to learn how to apply it, don't (inaudible ) up with something outside because you will only confuse yourself. And so that's something that we've seen again and again. The other thing related to that is umm… if you choose the theory and you want to be eclectic to choose something that goes along with that, that's a mismatch, it's like trying to put on a coat, that's too small because it doesn't quite fit, it's hard to work it, we had an experience recently where somebody was working from a theory that didn't make sense and when it came to case conceptualization, treatment planning was very difficult for that person to actually have a coherent way of moving forward. The other part of that is, if you want to try and become eclectic or what we call is integrated, you need to able to find things that work together of logically. So the short answer to the question is, that we discourage that especially in beginners because it's too complicated. The theories are rich in themselves and for most of them, what you can do is you can use techniques that will broaden them, but for beginners especially, we want you to choose something, get to know it well and move forward in that direction. Any other question? 

00:36:20
UNKNOWN Yes, I have a question. Out of the four forces which one is commonly used? 

00:36:30
PATRICIA ROBEY Well, that's, that's a good question, too. I would say right now the most commonly used approaches to therapy are the second force which is the cognitive behavioral approaches. That's largely due, I believe, to the fact that a lot of counseling practice is influenced by things outside of the individual. So if you are working in an agency, especially, if it's funded by the government or other agencies, there is often a, umm… a direction that has to be done in theory and only certain theories into certain approaches are accepted as being appropriate. And most of those then are the cognitive behavioral approaches. The reason for this again, like I mentioned before is because more research has been done to support the cognitive behavioral approaches because it's measurable. And so if people are funding agencies, if people are looking for insurance and so on and the counselor has to declare and approach there often is a list of acceptable approaches for people to adapt and so then it's up to the counselor to choose from that list to be accepted into certain insurances and so on. Now this can really be a dilemma for people who work outside of those approaches. And I think that's kind of goes back to what you were talking about the idea of being eclective, eclectic. Excuse me. Because you can still have your own theoretical approach. And this is what I experienced myself. And my theory is my theory. I can explain what I'm doing through my theoretical lens, when I'm extensively doing something else because I know how it works, I know how to explain it through that lens, but I know that ultimately I'm working from my own lens, but that would be the one that's primarily, I think the strongest one used today. Another question? 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN Yes, I have one. Could you tell us about a little about the process that you went through when choosing your own theory? 

00:38:55
PATRICIA ROBEY Oh, thank you. I'm happy to talk about that. I actually… I have an Associates Degree in Mental Health and when I was in that program we were trained and person-centered, at that time we're client, client-centered theory and client centered approaches, which has been a wonderful foundation for all the work I've done. And in fact, those basic values and beliefs in therapist, interventions are key to anything. But I remember when I was in that program feeling that sense of disconnect like putting on the coat that didn't fit because in order to adapt that as my theory, I would have to believe all the attendance that were associated to that, about why people change, and is that therapeutic relationship enough for people to change through that approach. So around that same time that I was working on my Associates Degree, I got connected to a social service agency in the south suburbs and at that agency, everyone was trained in reality therapy. And I went there as a volunteer. And so as a volunteer I was trained in reality therapy. And at that time, choice therapy wasn't even connected to that. It was actually a model putting it into action. So when I learned reality therapy, it was like not only did it fit, it was like a comfy robe because that approach to me met all the expectations, all my beliefs, the reason I like reality therapies so much is because it's an optimistic approach, it focuses on the present not the past unless that we're talking about past strengths. It helps people to move forward, it sees them as having strength, it really is, is applicable for the counseling model because it's a wellness model. And I felt like this was how I was raised, this was how my parents approached life and so it fit that way. And then later, Dr. Glasser who developed the reality therapy process, he started looking into the theory of why is this working. Originally Glassier was trained in a psychoanalytic perspective and he went to work in veterans hospital where he worked with schizophrenic patients and what he found was that the training that he had wasn't helpful for schizophrenic patients. And so, what he did then was to develop a way of working with them from a reality base perspective. And so, he instead of sitting across the desk from them and trying to have a conversation he would get up, he would sweep the floors with them and meanwhile make connections. And so that was what I liked about this also. So, but he didn't have that founding theory and so he developed then originally what he call control theory and then eventually change to choice theory because the idea… People were thinking control theory meant control over someone else and it really doesn't mean that. What it meant is that people have personal control of their lives. And I like that. I'm all about that because again it's so empowering and I find it very exciting to be working from that perspective. The other piece of it is thinking about the multi-cultural aspect. One of the things that's been interesting to me over the course of time is I have worked in counseling and started to think about the bigger picture and how to adapt that is from a multi-cultural perspective the importance of their relationship is the key piece. And so when clients come in to me, I know I have optimism for them, I have a confidence that they can do what it takes the change, but then what I also know is that I have the consider where they're coming from and what they believe and what they can do within the constrains that they have. And there in choice theory, there is existential component and that existential component is about the search for meaning and also freedom and responsibility for making personal choice and I'm thinking about umm… Viktor Frankl who is one of the major existentialist, if you remember, he wrote Man Search For Meaning. And he was in a concentration camp. And so, but the peace of it there I think stands out to me and how it relates to choice theory and reality therapy is that even though he was in a concentration camp which is one of the worst imaginable social situations that you can be in. What he found within himself was the personal resources to overcome what was going on. And it wasn't that he could control a lot, he can control very little, but what he could control was his thoughts and nobody could break the way he decided to think and the meaning that he attributed and to looking at the higher meaning of his experience and one of the things that he wrote about was recognizing that the greatest thing was love and remembering the people that he loved and moving forward in that way. I mean, it's so powerful, isn't it? And so, similarly from a choice theory perspective that existential peace of finding meaning and the importance of relationship and being able if nothing else to change the way that you're thinking about what's going on. And also, to be able to grasp on to the self about the importance and value of oneself to spy whatever anybody else is telling you. And so that's part of why this theoretical approach is so meaningful and important to me. And again, this is another example of how you can combine the multi-cultural approach to one of the other forces in counseling. And, but I wouldn't call it eclectic because it really is part of that theory and now the way of thinking about that really is related then to their approach. So I didn't drop my person-centered routes because certainly all of those behaviors that I learned in my Associates in Mental Health have provided that foundation in four meeting people where they are with that relationship. So you can tell us. I've been talking that I'm excited about theory. I do think that they're so fascinating, but you have to be able to think about it in different way because like many of you probably when you, were in your theories class it was just the theory of the week. And in fact, when I go to teach I, I guess lecture on choice theory and reality therapy in the theories courses. And by the time I come in it's usually later in the semester and I often ask the student, you know, how many of you have decided and your theoretical approach and no one knows because they're overwhelmed inundated. They have so many things in their minds. And what happens is every week there is something amazing about the theory and that's why it's so hard to choose one. It's like trying to choose what, who your favorite child is in a way. And the other thing that's interesting when you think about choosing your theory is that there are a lot of resources for deciding what your theoretical approach is. So if you go to new (inaudible ), for example, has a theory sorter and you can go there and you… It's a survey and you click off what your beliefs are. And then you, you know, get an idea about where to start. And I would say to you if you use those theory sorters,(ph) The important thing is to know that that's only a start what you need to do then is you need to say, well, this is what I'm interested in. Now let me go, find some information because finding the information is going to lead you and making a choice. And here is the other good thing. You don't have to sign a contract, you're not married to your theory. If you start to work with it and you say this is not for me you can change. That's awesome to know, isn't it? So it's not like you have to make a lifetime commitment. And people do change and they do for all when they start to think about things in different ways. So that's a lot to talk about in a short amount of time. And I really do appreciate very much your attention. I hope you're taking something away that's of usefulness to you, either personally or professionally or both. And like I said, when you pick out your theory, be mindful that you don't impose it on others that you think about it for yourself and how it's going to be useful and helpful for somebody else in counseling or even in your life. So thank you so much for your attention.
