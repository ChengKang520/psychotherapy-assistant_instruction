PTSD IN CHILDREN: Move in the Rhythm of the Child Frank M. Ochberg, M.D. 

00:00:00
FRANK M. OCHBERG  This video is meant to be useful for the child and the love ones of that child and the caretakers for that child where there's been a single, sudden episode of violence or a victimization. We know that there are many children, unfortunately, who live in poverty or, or whose parents are abusive, who are not well-informed about how to raise children, and were not dealing so much with the chronic condition of abuse and neglect. Ah, in a way, we're dealing with populations in which an intervention can make a dramatic difference because these are children who otherwise have the resources in the school, in the home. Ah, they're healthy, to begin with. They're normal people and they have suddenly faced a very abnormal event. And through the use of a video to be seen in the school, in the home, ah, a way that, ah, brothers and sisters and parents can look at something and then talk it over, ah, we're hoping that we can help.

00:01:10
KATHLEEN NADER  PTSD is the disorder that occurs after a child has been exposed to a catastrophic event and including things like, ah, natural disasters, or violence, or severe accidents and, ah, the components of the disorder in order for it to be qualified for the disorder, then the child must have experienced extreme helplessness or horror, ah, fearfulness, ah, during the event. Now, the -- there are, then, specific types of responses that children have to a catastrophic event, including symptoms of re-experiencing, symptoms of avoidance, and symptoms of arousal. 

00:01:55
Carl C. Bell, M.D. 

00:01:55
CARL BELL If you want to understand, ah, post-traumatic stress disorder and stress in children, I think it would be important to first understand how the body works, uhm, and as you, most people know, if the body is exposed to physical stress like running six miles from a rabid dog, ah, the body tries to balance itself, ah, stresses the, the exercise of running, and the body tries to balance itself by an increased breathing and an increase in the heart rate. The mind is no different from the body. Ah, the mind makes adjustments to stress, to psychological stress, and so you see very similar kinds of adjustments being made mentally, the same way you see the body making adjustments physically. Uhm, so every, every living thing does that. A child who runs six miles from a dog is gonna have the same physical balancing as an adult that runs six miles from a dog. Similarly, an adult who's exposed to an extreme stress is gonna try to re-balance themselves mentally, and a child is gonna try to re-balance himself mentally. The difference is, is that depending on how old the child is, they're going to have different, uhm, abilities to balance, and so helping that child cope depends on their age; helping that child cope depends on their previous experiences; uhm, helping that child cope depends on the family and how the family copes with that stress. So it's different for different ages of children.

Angie Panos, L.C.S.W., M.F.T. 

00:03:40
ANGIE PANOS  Children, ah, are more vulnerable and are less secure and have less power and status than our society anyway. And because of that, ah, the additional trauma, ah, that they go through, that of being, ah, feeling helpless, of feeling unsafe after, uhm, they've been through a traumatizing experience, can be more difficult for them to overcome. 

00:04:10
SYMPTOMS OF PTSD Re-experiencing Avoidance Arousal 

00:04:10
KATHLEEN NADER  Re-experiencing symptoms include things like the child is thinking about it all the time, the thoughts of the event are going, the child is going over in his or her mind thoughts about the event. Sometimes, children are seeing images in their mind or seeing pictures in their mind about what happened. A man who had actually himself been traumatized, ah, because he lost eight of his family members in the, in the Guyana, the Jonestown massacre, ah, was doing some fairly bizarre things. He was shooting an airplane and things like that and finally, one afternoon, he opened fire on a crowded elementary school playground. One little girl was shot- 

00:04:50
Re-experiencing 

00:04:50
KATHLEEN NADER -and the bullet entered through the side of her and went out the other side, taking lung and heart tissue with it. Uhm, she was, she didn't die immediately and she did call for help. There was another man who was passing by, it was a, a young man, an adolescent who's passing by and he was shot just completely open, and so there were children who witnessed each of those things. This slide shows, uhm, you can see here the little girl when she's calling for help. You can see the, the blood coming out of the side of her so that you know the child who drew this actually did witnessed this experience and this is one of the sorts of things that popped back into his mind again and again. This next picture is one, uh, of a child who drowned and you can see that it, it also represents the images that continue to pop back into the mind of a child who saw it. See these, how large the eyes, are and they're fixed and dilated. That was one of the hard things to see for people who witnessed this drowning. You also can see in this picture how, ah, the person has drawn the rescuers so very small because they were unable to help in any way. Another thing that happens for some children but not all children are bad dreams after a traumatic event. Now, little children often don't have the kind of dreams that older children have. They don't usually have a plot or, uhm, as often, have people in them, but we find to some extent one of the things that happens after traumatic experience is a loss of innocence, and this is one of the realms where there can be a loss of innocence. All of a sudden you have children dreaming very specific, ah, dreams, the, the little children, with plots in them and, and somebody coming to do harm to them. For example, a child who had gone through a catastrophic treatment for, for cancer, uhm, and had had a bone marrow transplant started to dream that cutters came and began to cut her up. Ah, children dream, ah, little children also often dream about monsters and, and, ah, danger, and ghosts, and things like that. Also, ah, there may just be, there may be dreams that are replications of the event itself, and yet, on the other hand, there maybe dreams that are simply, ah, dreams of danger to themselves or danger to the people that they care about. Now, some children will have dreams initially and then not have dreams afterwards, and a few children will even have, ah, ah, night terrors in which they don't remember the dream the next morning. Ah, and in fact, they may walk in their sleep or do dramatic things in their sleep and just not even know about it the next day. For example, there was a little girl who was exposed to this diaper(ph) attack who, ah, would wake and she would sit up in, in her bed screaming and then she'd run for the door and her family would have to stop her before she left the house, and she didn't remember any of it the next day. There's a little boy who had been, had actually when he was 18 months old drowned and been revived. And then years later, he began to re-experience thoughts about that drowning when he was exposed to an earthquake. Now, this little boy, ah, would get up in the middle of the night after the earthquake, walk into his parents' room and begin to talk to them about the drowning experience, and yet he didn't remember any of it the next morning. 

00:08:10
FRANK M. OCHBERG The second part of PTSD is almost the opposite. It's not having emotion. We're not having the kind of life that you had before. Deliberately or unconsciously you change something about yourself. You're numb. You don't do what you used to get gratification from. Children are so vulnerable to feeling ashamed and embarrassed. 

00:08:35
Avoidance 

00:08:35
FRANK M. OCHBERG And often, and what a therapist is doing who works with the child who's been traumatized is they help that child overcome some embarrassment, some sense of strangeness, to help them eventually find their way back into the playgroup and into the, into the school society, ah, but that, that cannot be overstated. The child may suffer, ah, physical hurt and disability. They may have PTSD and that they're having nightmares. But the fact that they feel like less of a person can deny them self-esteem, can deny them the ability to grow as part of a team, ah, it can really change, ah, their whole future if they don't overcome that shame. 

00:09:25
Erwin R. Parson, Ph.D. 

00:09:25
ERWIN R. PARSON Ah, less larger and stop going certain places. They just would not go and parents can't get them to go. Sometimes parents forget the incident because they wanna forget. We all wanna forget. Everybody wants to forget what happened and, uhm, the child wants to forget too. But sometimes, something as seemingly innocuous as going to a park for a nice, Sunday afternoon ballgame becomes, ah, an incredibly painful and anxiety-provoking experience for a child, you know, who, who remembers what happened there. 

00:09:55
SYMPTOMS OF PTSD Re-experiencing Avoidance Arousal 

00:09:55
KATHLEEN NADER  The children that experience symptoms of arousal, including sleep disturbance, impairment to concentration, increased irritability, ah, sometimes expressions of anger or aggression. One of the things we've been able to do is take a look at how, what happens to children in terms of their startle response and we find that, you know, for those of us, if we know a loud noise is going to happen, often enough we can inhibit our startle response to that loud noise. Sometimes, after a traumatic experience, children leave their, lose their ability to inhibit that startle response. For example, when, when they hold up the flash cards and children shout out answers, some children startle, ah, after they've been traumatized. Or when they're in, uh, the auditorium at school and the microphone pops, that these children are startled. And I've worked with one child who, every time the clock ticked, she jumped, ah, because she had, she was very traumatized and had an extreme startle response. 

00:11:00
ERWIN R. PARSON There's inability of the central nervous system to modulate arousal. 

00:11:05
Arousal 

00:11:05
ERWIN R. PARSON One of the wonderful things about how the central nervous system is made in the brain is that it controls arousal very well. If we get excited, upset, ah, within minutes, ah, the system quiets itself down. In children with, children with post-traumatic stress disorder, that particular capacity becomes dysfunctional, therefore a child looks very hyper, hyperactive, hyper alert, excitable, excited, and comes across look very jittery and out of control, and naturally has an impact on people around the child in terms of his ability or her ability to interact with children of his or her own age and to, uh, be able to be, ah, regarded as a peer. 

00:11:50
STAGES OF TREATMENT Psychological First Aid Initial Assessment Brief Therapy Long Term Therapy Dr. Kathleen Nader, D.S.W. 

00:11:50
KATHLEEN NADER  In the first week or two following the traumatic experience, the initial first aid, and there's more than one psychological first aid, but the initial first aid, uhm, has to do with giving the factual information with normalizing children's responses, letting them know that all of their responses are normal following the traumatic experience, uhm, but without going into great detail. You're, you're at that point in time making an attempt to both restore safety and restore a sense of safety. 

00:12:25
Erwin R. Parson, Ph.D. 

00:12:25
ERWIN R. PARSON I recall some years ago, I treated a boy who had been traumatized at age 4 and some at age 11. But, uhm, the problems were just as fresh as it happened yesterday. 

00:12:35
Psychological First Aid 

00:12:35
ERWIN R. PARSON  Uhm, I thought, I think the child had been quite better off had he been seen at four or five, as opposed to 11. Uhm, ah, when I saw him, he was in such ah, to rough shape, ah, when it comes to his cognition and his ability to process emotions and so on that, uhm, he was diagnosed as having childhood schizophrenia. He was diagnosed as being, or in disabled, had been retarded, uhm, and organic. Uhm, I found out that he was not, didn't, didn't have schizophrenia at all. He wasn't retarded at all, and so on and so forth. But there was a trauma that so devastated this child's capacity to, to integrate new information and to process information that he came across as being pretty, ah, withdrawn and retarded when in fact he really wasn't. So, trauma can do really devastating things with children when it's not picked up early and a proper intervention is made on behalf of the child. 

00:13:45
Frank M. Ochberg, M.D. 

00:13:45
FRANK M. OCHBERG The second wound or the second injury is the wound we give by asking people to tell the story and by responding to them with shock or horror or inappropriate timing and, and what we do is we demean them and then we damage them and we take away their respect, and there have been many people who have told me the second wound was worst than the first. They expected when they came to the hospital that they would be treated with dignity and instead they were disrobed in a public place. Ah, questions were asked that implied that they were at fault for being raped, or, or the job wasn't done well and evidence was lost. So all of us who work with victims, particularly vulnerable child victims, have to avoid inflicting a second wound. 

00:14:35
KATHLEEN NADER  It's also important to know in that initial phase because it's going to be announced so that people will know something has happened and the children may be injured. 

00:14:45
Psychological First Aid 

00:14:45
KATHLEEN NADER So all of a sudden parents are rushing. If they're not with their children, they're rushing to the scene of the trauma. Uhm, it's essential to know that, ah, when a child sees a parent looking frightened or horrified, that that in fact may become a part of the traumatic imagery that replays itself from the child. Sometimes children in fact assess how horrible the experience was that they went through when they see the look on a parent's face and so for that reason, we find that that it's important for parents to, uh, have a moment to settle down before they approach their children. For example after a tornado, the parents were, were moved into a specific room. They had a chance to talk briefly with the school psychologist and then were taken to their child so that again, you didn't have that child exposed to that look of frantic horror. 

00:15:35

00:15:35
FRANK M. OCHBERG The assessment, let's say after a few weeks the five-year-old is wetting the bed and is clinging to mom and doesn't want to go to kindergarten. So that five-year-old might come in and talk to Kathleen Nader or some, uh, some local child expert on trauma, and it's done in different ways. Often it's, uh, it's mom and child together for the first time, and then they might be separated. But the, the therapist in this assessment wants to find out if PTSD is the issue, if there are other things going on as well. What are the resources? What are the coping devices? Ah, then begin to get a sense of whether long-term treatment, short-term treatment, or, or just some re-assurance is needed. 

00:16:25
ERWIN PARSONS School teachers are often very helpful and so I, I try to get all information I can from anyone that knows this child. 

00:16:35
Initial Assessment 

00:16:35
ERWIN PARSONS Ah, I'm interested in those persons know knew the child before the incident, who, ah, 'coz I, I think it's important to get a sense as to how, 'coz most often what, adults will say that this child has changed in very dramatic ways and profound ways. A lot of times, the change is, is really dramatic because a lot of times, these children might have been exposed to earlier traumata and no one took note of it. Ah, yeah, the child changed but he was still okay. He wasn't acting out violently. He wasn't, ah, ah, setting fires and, and maybe the extreme kinds of behavior so it could be dangerous for people around him, but this time is different. This time he's, uh, uh, much more irritable, nervous, uh, uh, cries a lot more, much more depressed or withdrawn and, uh, has been doing a few things that adults may perceive as being highly unusual, I mean scary to the safety of other members of the family, ah, so that's when the child comes in quite often. One of the things I do is, is go through a whole, whole assessment of, uh, previous stressors, not only of, in the, in the child but also in members of the child's family because stress does affect, and parents has affect children. So, I'd like to know in terms of looking at the child's, uh, vulnerability, I'd like to know who else in the family had been exposed to car accidents, or had been to war, or have been traumatized in an unfortunate situation of rape, and so on and so forth. So, uh, that's all part of the, of the assessment process.

Carl C. Bell, M.D. 

00:18:10
CARL BELL  Some teenagers, you can establish rapport right away, just very quickly, uh, and they just trust you 'coz they know that you know and it's okay. Uhm, other teenagers, you know, regardless of who you are, they may never trust you 'coz they've already been damaged. 

00:18:35
Patient - Clinician Trust 

00:18:35
CARL BELL They've already been in a relationship with somebody who has died, or abandoned them, or something bad has happened, ah, and they're not quick to trust. And in fact, the more trustworthy you are and the more they want a relationship with you, the more it scares them away from establishing one and they fight you, and test you, and do all kinds of stuff, ah, that makes it difficult. Uhm, younger children, uhm, depending on how you relate, uh, depending on your relationship skills, depending on the chemistry between you and the younger kid, uhm, you know, it's, there are a lot of different factors, uh, that go into it. But being as personable, generally warm, kind, honest, direct, reliable, those things are a big help the most. 

00:19:25
ERWIN PARSONS This, uhm, girl had been held hostage. Uhm, ah, she was captured with her father and her father was murdered right in front of her, and the assailants kept threatening her repeatedly that they will, will kill her also. And she was held for, for a very long time, days at time, maybe four, five, or six, maybe six days, to just, just with, just with the dead body and with these threatening, ah, characters, threatening her every minute "You'll be next, you'll be next." And, uhm, by the time I saw her, uh, the incident that happened, perhaps, uh, it's two years or so had happened and, uhm, and she was having nightmares in her dreams, and the rage, and, ah, hallucinating. Ah, even though I could find no evidence that she was psychotic but she would hallucinate the, the, the, ah, you know, ah, the, the whole event, you know, the, the, the sensation, you know, the presence of the father, the fact he's not there that she feels he's there and she's kneeling over him. Uhm, and, uhm, therapy with her was extremely rocky because of the loss and the way it happened. It was brutal. And, uhm, the type of trauma and how it happens, uh, uh, obviously has a lot to do with, with knowing how the, the course of the therapy will take, but also the difficulty in making any kind of progress. With her it's extremely difficult because of the trust factor. Ah, it didn't matter whether she was, whether it was a male or a female therapist. It didn't matter at all. Ah, she just didn't wanna budge. She didn't wanna trust anyone. 

00:21:20
STAGES OF TREATMENT Psychological First Aid Initial Assessment Brief Therapy Long Term Therapy 

00:21:20
KATHLEEN NADER  Grief therapy is aimed at helping the child to understand how the trauma impacts his life and, ah, forming some resolution toward his experience. We have regular meetings with teachers if it's, ah, in the school, regular meetings with parents, regular meetings with administrators. We begin to train a staff, if there's not already a trained staff to do specific clinical interventions with traumatic response. We've already identified now which children need intervention. Ah, we begin to, ah, set up regular, ah, group interventions, words appropriate sometimes for grieving children, sometimes for parents whose children have been injured, Sometimes for, ah, parents because their children are traumatized, ah, parents whose children have died and, uhm, begin to have open lines of communication between the teachers and the clinicians so that the changes in the classroom were addressed as they evolve. 

00:22:25
CARL BELL  I think if you do in brief with somebody who's just been traumatized, you can have a, 

00:22:30
Brief Therapy 

00:22:30
CARL BELL a, a better, longer lasting impact than doing long-term with somebody who got traumatized 20 years ago, ah, now that, you know, it's not one-to-one like that but it's just more opportunity sometimes. 

00:22:45
FRANK M. OCHBERG And in short-term treatment, you're often trying to restore a sense of trust and security to get the story told, ah, perhaps to help see that child through the, ah, the resolution of a few symptoms. So, if there's been bed-wetting, it's not a shameful thing and the bed-wetting will often clear. If there are nightmares, they're talked about and there'll be some reassurance, and often there is clear up rather quickly. Ah, but depending on what happened, there may be some longer term issues. Ah, let's say it's a, it's a really bad event. The teacher was killed in front of the class and there are children who don't want to go back to that class. Brief therapy might help several children feel comfortable in the school but one or two might, might not be ready in a month. And then that might lead to longer term treatment. 

00:23:40
STAGES OF TREATMENT Psychological First Aid Initial Assessment Brief Therapy Long Term Therapy 

00:23:40
KATHLEEN NADER  Children who are severely traumatized often need long-term treatment. And especially if there are complicating factors from the child's previous life experience, ah, long-term treatment may be indicated. Ah, when that happens, you're not only dealing with the specific aspects of the child's traumatic experience, but you're also dealing with personality issues and developmental issues as they begin to become, ah, intertwined with issues of the trauma. 

00:24:15
FRANK M. OCHBERG You have to be aware that PTSD, by definition, comes back. 

00:24:20
Long Term Treatment 

00:24:20
FRANK M. OCHBERG It isn't a steady state, but there will invariably be anniversary reactions, reminders, and suddenly a person will feel all those feelings again. If they haven't been warned about this, they could think they've gone right back to zero and I find often, my job is to, ah, buoy up someone who's been demoralized and, and even to say something, "Do you think PTSD is trivial?" And, and when you give this entity it's respect for the power that it has, I, I, I think people can deal with themselves better. 

00:25:00
Angie Panos, L.C.S.W., M.F.T. 

00:25:00
ANGIE PANOS  Now, the last stage, the longer term treatment, it's really important to understand that, ah, treatment might not be continuous; it might be sequential. And by that I mean that as a child goes through the next developmental stage or reaches a major developmental task and accomplishes it, they will have new life experience, a new way of thinking. Their, ah, ability to, ah, understand their world will completely change as they mature, and at those times, they will need to revisit the experience- 

00:25:45
Long Term Treatment - Revisiting 

00:25:45
ANGIE PANOS -that they went through, the traumatic experience, to re-integrate it and re-process it into their, ah, memories, and into their, ah, life. 

00:25:55
FRANK M. OCHBERG It can be metaphorical and usually is. Every once in a while, it is, literally, revisiting. And the ultimate in overcoming a fear that has become a phobia so that there's avoidance of certain places would be to confront that very scene. Now, if a, ah, a life-threatening event occurred in a place that you must revisit, an elevator, if you will, from the 20th floor, ah, a classroom if something happened in school and you are gonna have to go back to school, then some desensitization to that site is important. And we're finding now that the strategies for helping people overcome these fears are not too different from strategies that were for people who are agoraphobic, including kids. So, ah, there are range of approaches; some of them deal with tolerating a very, very anxiety-provoking scene until you live through your anxiety; in other words you flooded yourself and you know, and you're exhausted but you've gotten to the other end of that whole display of emotion. And, uh, those therapies have been shown to work. 

00:27:15
ANGIE PANOS Therapy has to be, ah, offered at important times in their life. Now, it's really common for parents to come in and say, "My child's been through this terrible trauma, please fix them. Give them all the therapy they need so they never have to worry about this again," and we need to educate the parent that we're sorry but that is not possible because that child, this is something that is part of their history; that is something that they will always have to find a way to deal with. And although we can help alleviate the symptoms of their experiencing at that time, there will come a time when they need to revisit that, ah, experience and re-think about it, and re-process it, and then integrate it into their memories. 

00:28:05
CARL BELL  Working with the family to help them be supportive, ah, is sometimes indicated. Ah, working with the authorities 'coz if the family is responsible for the kid's traumatic stress, you had to do something to break that up, and that's real messy because most of these kids love the people in their family, ah, so it's a real double-edged sword of breaking families up versus keeping families together and changing their behavior. And if the behavior is never gonna change, we'll break the family up, the kids at risk. If the behavior is, is temporary 'coz maybe the parents are stressed out and you can relieve that, then maybe it's a better idea to keep the family together and, and, 'coz you don't want to double stress the kid.

00:28:55
FRANK M. OCHBERG  We are a verbal animal. We put things into words. Ah, but when it comes to trauma, there are aspects of it that really don't do too well in words. And in fact, there's, uh, an odd word called alexithymia. That one is defined by Henry Crystal and it has to do with the inability to put your emotions into words. But if you can't put some of these events into words, can you put them into drawings? Can we put them into drama? 

00:29:25
Drawing and Play Therapy 

00:29:25
FRANK M. OCHBERG  Can you, can you put it into some non-verbal expression? Yes, you can. It turns out that children, by and large, are rather remarkable at telling their stories in pictures, ah, and giving us a chance to view what their internal reality is, and it may be very, very different from what they've had actually seen. They're not drawing portraits of perpetrators. They're beginning to tell what's inside their imagination, and that becomes a major tool that the child trauma therapist can use. 

00:30:05
Erwin R. Parson, Ph.D. 

00:30:05
ERWIN R. PARSON  It's not always possible for a child to talk the way I'm talking, the way adults talk, but children can communicate in many, many ways. A very natural way of children communicating is through drawings. 

00:30:35
Dr. Kathleen Nader, D.S.W. 

00:30:35
KATHLEEN NADER We ask them to draw a picture of anything they want to and then to tell a story about it. And in that process, sometimes they reveal to us, ah, some of the things that are very relevant to them with regard to the traumatic experience. For example, ah, the little girl who drew a deep, dark lake and she began to ink that lake in, ah, over and over again, she told me she was drawing a picture of a park that, ah, she liked to play in and yet she was spending so much time darkening that lake. And when I looked at her and said to her, ah, "I bet there are things in that lake, deep in that lake that nobody knows are there." She bursts into tears and began to tell me how, ah, her mother had, uh, friends of her mother and relatives of her mother had died traumatically and she was now, since the traumatic experience that happened to her, very afraid that her mother would be killed. This was somebody who was not directly exposed to the traumatic event, that, you say, she was communicating through that picture to me that there was something buried under that water; there was something there. 

00:31:35
ANGIE PANOS  In this particular drawing, the child draws herself, her brother, her mother, and then, as you can see, the father is drawn as a black tornado. Although she had expressed to me her feelings about her father, he was an alcoholic. He was very verbally, physically, sexually, emotionally abusive to her. It was not completely possible for me to understand exactly, uhm, how she felt. When a child expresses some feelings, ah, toward a parent, it's always, ah, complicated because they do have a loyalty often towards that parent. They do have some bonding towards that parent even though that parent has been very abusive to them, so it, it becomes a very complex issue to discuss and a therapist has to walk a careful line to avoid not appearing to take sides with that child, uhm, to avoid bringing up any loyalty complex that they may have as a result of that. 

00:32:50
KATHLEEN NADER Those images become, ah, embedded in children's drawings and they also, the, the issues also become a part of their play, following traumatic experiences. One little boy, a year after the sniper attack, set up on a, a carpet, a large carpet, he put schools here, there, all over. He made a little city of schools all over the carpet, and then he brought in helicopters and he brought in police cars and always, there was some disaster happening at the schools, and yet he would bring in these policemen and rescue workers to stop them before anything bad happened. 

00:33:25
ERWIN R. PARSON  We set up a scenario of, uhm, again, depending upon the relationship of the child. There's all kinds of configuration of toys that one can set up and have the child- 

00:33:35
Play Therapy 

00:33:35
ERWIN R. PARSON -replay the incident with those dolls, or trucks, and, and weapons and whatever, ah, and one way of processing what really happened. Ah, sometimes, uhm, I'm surprised at the kind of configuration of, of play that a child sets up, parts of it that I wasn't aware of because I haven't been told. No one told me about a particular part of that, of what the tragedy had happened. Sometimes, sometimes the child can't remember it either but as he or she plays, the mind gives it up; the amnesia gives way to remembering and so the child plays it out; often can't put, put it into words because it's so painful still but can behaviorally re-enact what happened. 

00:34:25
KATHLEEN NADER One, the little girl who had been, ah, who had watched her father be stabbed played over and over again in her sessions at, at disasters and, 

00:34:35
Play Therapy 

00:34:35
KATHLEEN NADER and because the stabbing itself was so horrible to her, she started with other unrelated disasters and eventually worked her way up to these specific, ah, instances of violence. But always, before she got to that point, always in her play, something terrible would happen and then somebody would rescue, somebody would come to the aid and then finally, when she finished that set of her play, she began to have, ah, interpersonal violence in her play, and finally one of the characters took the name of the cousin who had done the stabbing until she beca, finally was able to actually depict in her play the incident.

00:35:15
CARL BELL Haah! I remember, uh, uh, '76 I saw a four-year-old girl who had seen her mother stabbed to death and, you know, I did like Play Therapy 101, you know, and I just, you know what I mean, just play with the kid and let her get used to me. The kid wouldn't talk at all, I mean would not talk, and we'd play. And we played for, I guess, three, four months, you know, once a week, uhm, and I was, I guess I was, uh, in a hurry to help her, ah, so after this time, I would ask her from time to time about how she was feeling about this, you know, or I was expecting to see some dramatic play and it never showed up and she never would talk to me about it. Uhm, and then I lost her because she, her grandmother took her who knows where, uhm, and I, and, you know, it's real hard to judge was I moving too fast, was I pushing, or, ah, was I not pushing hard enough, ah, 'coz a lot of times, if you're in a poor clinic setting, you don't get real stable families sometimes and they have to move around because of poverty and all kinds of problems, so it's almost like you feel this urge to get in and help her real quick and then get out. Uhm, it's not like you have the luxury of having someone who's got a decent education, who's got a decent place to live, who's got decent healthcare, who's psychologically-minded, ah, who understands that this kid's been exposed to extreme stress and really needs to come to build a relationship so they can deal with their stress.

KATHLEEN NADER  We also can look at children in the inner cities who are exposed on a regular basis to violence. I think that you have to know that, that there are some differences in response based on the nature of the trauma itself, based also on the phase of trauma. For example, the children that I interviewed in Croatia were in a very different phase of things than the children in Kuwait. The war was over in Kuwait. In Croatia, the war was still going on and so the children were more, uhm, focused on not the results of the war but on coping with the ongoing war. And so that I think, to some extent, what you see with, ah, children in the inner cities is some of that sort of thing. It's, the war's still on. There's not a closure. We're not responding to something that happened already and is finished, but are in an, or in the process of still dealing with coping with the on-going war. 

00:38:05
Inner City Erwin R. Parson, Ph.D. 

00:38:05
ERWIN R. PARSON It's important to look at the problems of, of Inner City children from a different perspective, and the reason for that is because the, the, uhm, the threat to life and the stressors are so continuous, so we're talking about an environment of continuous stressors and threats to life. Ah, it's one thing when the threat happens all of a sudden and it goes away and you've, and you have a, and you can say, "Gee, I'm, I'm alive. Isn't it wonderful I'm alive?" and this may never happen again. But, uh, many children in the Inner City have the sense that it will happen again and perhaps next time, the catastrophe will be much worse than it was this time. And so that there is this anxious- 

00:38:50
Inner City 

00:38:50
ERWIN R. PARSON  sense of being hyper-aroused and anticipating catastrophe that makes it very hard for a child to relax and to pay attention to life, to wanting to live, ah, to wanting to engage and, and, and, and things that are on grow, on development and maturation; looking forward to a future, ah, to growing up, being productive citizens, to the loving and being loved. Ah, it's very, very difficult and oft, often in very, uhm, an impossible to do in some situations. I think it that the therapist needs to know himself or herself very well and know what the meaning of violence is to them; and certainly getting in touch with, ah, with the kind of stereotypes we see in the media, about who commits all the violence and, and images, ah, and our feelings about that. And I think those, those are very important because unless that's understood quite well, uhm, I think that there can be a spillover into the treatment which would adversely affect the relationship, and the child will pick up on that. It's kinda hard to be honest, ah, unless you, you know where you're coming from. Working with the Inner City children, a lot of things come together, I mean issues around ethnicity and race and culture, things about violence, ah, poverty, uhm, and also about trauma, you know. Trauma is still something that we can't talk about very much, ah, regardless of who we are and where we come from. It's very hard to talk about trauma, the effects of, of any, an event; one single event that can change our life so radically and completely. Ah, that's very hard to talk about. 

00:40:35
CARL BELL Right now, the country is trying to do something about violence and I think we're somewhat confused, uhm, because there's this move of which take a public health approach to violence prevention. And I think that's very useful because we did something about smoking and done a lot about car accidents. Smoking is behavior, drinking is behavior, violence is behavior, so it's clear you can change people's behavior to decrease the cause of death in a society. If we can do something about smoking, do something about alcohol, certainly you can do something about violence. The problem is that we're confused, and what we're confused about is predatory violence which are career criminals that perpetrate predatory violence, versus interpersonal altercation, relationship violence. There, personal altercation, relationship violence is the one that is amenable to public health. Predatory violence is why they build prisons, and I'm glad that they do 'coz I think some people who are criminally violent need to be locked up. And, and yes, if we could get to them when they're six months old and they're being abused and abandoned and neglected by their families, maybe they wouldn't grow up to be predators, so there's even early intervention prevention there. But after they're 30 and they're chronically, criminally and predatorily violent, put them in prison; leave them there for long, long time. Protect them. Protect me from them. On the other hand, if you're talking about- 

00:42:00
Inner City 

00:42:00
CARL BELL -domestic violence, you're talking about kids who got bad tempers and fight, let's identify, let's screen, let's treat them, let's debrief them about their own violence. Let's teach them conflict resolution, and I think we can do something about that violence in society.

00:42:20
FRANK M. OCHBERG  For some kids, medication would be used. It might be that PTSD happens along with other problems. It's a hyperactive child. The hyperactivity hasn't been diagnosed. It hasn't been treated. Ah, the mind and body are fidgeting and working overtime so there could be a combination of attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder, and a form of posttraumatic stress disorder. Children can get depressed. It's, ah, it's sometimes a more difficult diagnosis and treatment to work out with children, but, ah, children take antidepressants when they need them. And you wanna be very cautious about getting a child started on a medication that affects the central nervous system, so it would be important to have a good assessment and discussion of the risks and benefits with the parent; and sometimes a trial to see how it occurs, and then getting on a, ah, a general regime. I'm much more reluctant to use medication with children than with adults, but, uh, different doctors have, have different experiences and different feelings about that and you certainly don't wanna deny a child the chance to have their anxiety reduced, their depression lifted, and their sleep enhanced if all of these are impaired and they're missing out on school and friends and, ah, and normal development. 

00:44:00
CARL BELL We try to intervene, ah, sometimes with medication at the case of the kid who had been tortured by his stepfather. Ah, this guy would put this kid in a closet, naked, ah, after beating him and leave him there for, like, six hours in the middle of the night. This went on for years. Finally, they got found out. The kid went to the grandmother, ah, where he was warm, safe, he was protected, and the grandmother died after a year. And then he gets adopted or he goes into a foster home and he's okay there, but now, because the kid is having nightmares every night, he's sleeping two hours. The reason the kid got to me is because- 

00:44:45
Psycho-Pharmacology 

00:44:45
CARL BELL -he was fighting in school. They didn't bring him because he'd had a traumatic stress, his grandmother died. That wasn't the chief, the chief, he's fighting in school. Ah, I wasn't real sure of what fighting represented for him. I got the history, found out he was sleeping two hours a night, I had to put him on medication; put him on antidepressant to help him sleep, calm him down a bit. He started getting eight hours of sleep at night; we got eight hours of sleep at night. He would no longer go to school cranky and irritable. He stopped fighting. He stopped fighting, uh, and he was accessible to treatment, to getting the nurturance from his foster home, so medication is sometimes indicated.

FRANK M. OCHBERG  The PTSD is very different from grief and when they go together, often one has to get through the PTSD first and then the grief. And so, to cure one thing and then you start a long process of something else, it's a double dose of very, very difficult human adaptation, uh, but it can be done. 

00:45:55
Dr. Kathleen Nader, D.S.W. 

00:45:55
KATHLEEN NADER  When children have been, been exposed to a traumatic death, it is not a simple, it's not an uncomplicated bereavement anymore and in fact, it's been found that, uh, sudden, unexpected death is associated with path, pathological bereavement. Uhm, I think that with, uhm, the interaction of trauma and grief that what happens is a number of things. First of all, that when you're recovering from a trauma, when you're recovering from a grieving process, part of what you must do is think about the person who died, reminiscing, ah, yearning for them. Those are all normal aspects of grieving. However, when there's been a traumatic death and you go to think about the person who died, you, you then find your sink, self thinking about the manner in which they died, so that now you're thrown into traumatic response. You're thinking of the horror of the death, the manner it happened, perhaps blood and mutilation, ah, that sort of thing, so that, that we found that most often, ah, some amount of trauma work takes precedence over, uh, bereavement. Now, the children are different. You, you really do have to let trauma move in a rhythm of the child and some children will be able to talk about the traumatic, we'll need to do trauma work first and, and then in the same session we'll be able to do some grief work. Other children may need to do several trauma sessions, and then do some grief work and go back to trauma work. Uhm, it's different with each child. 

00:47:30
ERWIN R. PARSON Many times, uh, grief, uh, emerges in a treatment way down the road; it doesn't happen right away. And what covers up the grief is the anger and the hostility. That covers up the grief. 

00:47:45
Trauma and Grief 

00:47:45
ERWIN R. PARSON  When the relationship works well in therapy and a child is able to relax his defenses and able to feel better about his experience and feel that there's someone who listens and understands and who won't be judgmental, someone who can support the child and try in helping the child to recover, ah, when that happens, then, then it becomes possible for the child to become in, to get in touch with grief. Grief is very, very painful and it's something that is avoided at all cost in a child, and can only emerge after a good, solid relationship and trust has been established. And the child somehow gets a signal: now it's time to get in touch with these depressive emotions; now it's time, now it's okay to feel all the hurt and pain. Ah, but without doing that, the child can't move, move beyond where he or she might be. And quite often, a lot of kids we find in school who are aggressive and hostile, with the weapons are kids who have not been able to grieve and if had a kinda impacted grief; kinda grief upon grief; never had an opportunity of getting those emotions out. 

00:48:55
Carl C. Bell, M.D. 

00:48:55
CARL BELL It's almost like they're two threads that run through people. One thread is anxiety, and stress, and, and, and being flooded and overwhelmed, and another thread is loss, separation, uh, death, uh, depression. So you got these two threads running out, these two themes of human life, and what happens when there's a, a traumatic death. Ah, I saw another kid who saw his father get, his father stabbed his mother 64 times, so he's dealing with the stress of that and the frenzy of his father stabbing his mother to death. And he's dealing with the loss of his mother. So he's got two themes running: an anxiety theme and a grief depression theme, and the anxiety is interfering with his ability to process, and mourn and introject. A patient once told me that, uh, the way she got over her grief was she learned to hold her mother in her heart. And as long as her mother was in her heart, her mother would always be alive in some way. Ah, now, Freud calls that object representations, uhm, but I like her way better. Ah, and, and if every time you try to hold someone in your heart, that reminds you of the grizzly way that they died. You try to get them out of there so you never have them with you without the reminder and the stress from the reminder. So it's hard, uh, it's hard work. 

00:50:55
TREATMENT TOPICS Drawing and Play Therapy The Inner City Psycho-Pharmacology Trauma and Grief Clinician Self-Care Frank M. Ochberg, M.D. 

00:50:55
FRANK M. OCHBERG  People in the health professions, and people in the police and other allied professions do have to be careful about their feelings when they're exposed to traumatized children. For some of us, it seems to be important to get back into the line of fire rather quickly; for others it seems to be important to take a break. Burnout as used to describe relentless responsibility and if you stay in the line of emotional fire too long, you can lose your concentration. You can lose your sense of humor. You can lose your desire to relax with somebody else, and then perhaps, uh, a supervisor or a colleague has to tap you on the shoulder and say, "Hey, Frank, time for a vacation." 

00:51:40
KATHLEEN NADER  It's essential that people who work with trauma, they take good care of themselves, uhm, both for their own sakes and for the sake of the children. It's hard to do good trauma work when, ah, you've gotten to the point where you're so overwhelmed with the trauma, or you're so inundated with trauma that, ah, you're going a little too fast sometimes, or, ah, wanting, not wanting to go to the deeper meaning of the specific issue of a traumatic moment for someone, that both you and the child are tired of the trauma and don't wanna take it home with you anymore and so, ah, you, maybe, have, ah, terminate prematurely or don't address issues as thoroughly as is, uh, called for. So it's essential that, uh, a clinician working with, especially working with trauma- 

00:52:35
Clinician Self-Care 

00:52:35
KATHLEEN NADER -take good care of themselves, and that's true with just basic things like eating well and exercising. I think when we're overwhelmed, we tend to stop to do some, doing some of those basic things like eating right, and getting exercise, and doing recreational things that take good care of us. It's also essential when you're doing trauma work to do some of your own debriefing. Some cases, especially, you need to talk out with other people, but it's important on a regular basis with trauma to have a chance to speak about those cases with a trusted colleague, to talk them out into, uhm, to have a chance to hear them out loud and to process them that way. It's, it's important that you have a good support system as well when you're doing this, that you're, you're taking in a lot of nurturance because you have to give a lot of, ah, a lot doing trauma work as well. 

00:53:20
CARL BELL  You gotta, you gotta be very mindful of the fact that you're a therapist, you're a professional, you're being paid, uhm, so you've got to be professional about how you go about your work. You got to separate your work from your home. You have to have real clear boundaries, very clear boundaries about what you're doing and the people you're dealing with. Ah, you gotta, you gotta be prophylactic. You gotta practice what you preach. You gotta exercise and take care of your physical health. You gotta get good sleep at night. You gotta have good sex, and you gotta be clear that when you get worn down and you're on your, you know when, when your gas tank, the light comes on and the arrow is on E, you got to tell people to get out of your face 'coz you need to go and recharge your batteries. 

00:54:15
Erwin R. Parson, Ph.D. 

00:54:15
ERWIN R. PARSON  The, they, the therapist to remain sharp because, uh, the therapist becomes the instrument of change. If the therapist, as an instrument, isn't working very well because of anxiety, because of being tired, and worn out, or burned out, naturally the instrument will not be as, as useful to the child. So taking care of one's self to the therapist is really important, ah, because it's not unusual for, uhm, a therapist to internalize the, the impact, the power of the trauma, internalize it, own it, and come down with similar symptoms.
