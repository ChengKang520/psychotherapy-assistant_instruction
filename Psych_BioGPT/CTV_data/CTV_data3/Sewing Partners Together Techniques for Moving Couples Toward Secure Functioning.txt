TECHNIQUES FOR MOVING COUPLES TOWARDS SECURE FUNCTIONING 

00:00:20
STAN TATKIN, PsyD, MFT 

00:00:35
STAN TATKIN All right, let's get started if you don't mind. I'm Stan Tatkin. Oh, let me raise my chair a little bit here. I'm gonna do a clinical demonstration of a techniques called crossing and let me explain why I do it this way. There'll be more explanation by the way in the workshops that I'll be doing tomorrow. You'll get much more comprehensive idea of why I'm going to be doing today, but basically I'm getting information as quickly as I can. And what is that aren't usual, very strategic, I'm not simply listening to narrative, I'm watching for micro expressions, micro movements, if I can find a heat beat, people, I will, tracking skin color and normally, this is done by knowing a couple a little bit, and getting their baselines because you can't really tell the differences, and how people acts, and move, or have their voice sounds until you get baselines. I won't be able to do that as well tonight, but I'll do it as best as I can. Crossing basically is a cross dialogic technique of going in the opposite direction. This idea is based on, I belief that the couple is in each other's care, not their own care. This is based on psycho biological models of arousal regulation, but I'll get more into that tomorrow. By the way if you want to know more about how I work and issues that I can't get into right now about memory, perception, and communication, you can look at my TED Talk I'd have done recently, that information is there for you online if you wish which is based a little bit on circular questioning, the Milan group if you recall used circular questioning basically as their entire tool after a while, but that requires triads in order to do circular questioning effectively. Since we're only dealing with dyads, we can't use triads, right? So we do cross questioning. I ask one person about the other person, this person about that person, they're in each other's care, and so it's appropriate. There is other things that I do that are crossed such as cross interpretation or cross commenting. The target is not disturbed in terms of their arousal, I mean my eyes are not on them, it's on the other person, so it's an aroused trick, but it's also a way to get as much information as I can in the shortest amount of time. And I do cross interpretation, you're also going to see another technique called going down the middle and going down the middle is for those of you who are familiar with Tavistock is basically addressing the couple as, as a system itself, no individual, actually you, guys, the both of you, and it's going down the middle you'll see that as well. Occasionally tonight I'll be doing more direct questioning because of the nature of the case this evening more on that in a few moments. So I'm going to bring up a real couple. I do not know these folks. I met them just recently and I, but I do know something about what is the central problem right now for them, it's a situational issue, having nothing to do with the couple itself, but it involves them, and so when I bring them up they will be miked, and hopefully you'll be able to get a good view of our faces, and their faces. Another thing you'll notice, that's cross is the tracking. So I'm asking the question and my eyes will go to this person who's not talking, when this person starts to talk my eyes go to this person who's not talking, I try to catch the face of the person who is completed talking so I can see whatever washes over their face after they stop using tremendous amount of resources for speaking. So that's what I will be doing. It looks a little bit weird from the outside. The people who are here should not feel that it is actually very strange, may not be something you want to do when you go out into the wild, however if you do this technique you'll get more information you hope for if you're out with your friends or couples and so on, it is an effective way of getting to know people and finding out what's happening in a short amount of time. Okay, so without further ado I'd like to introduce you to the couple who will be joining me tonight. It's Bruce and Judy, and by the way we have rolling chairs, I work with chairs on wheels so I can regulate myself. Now I can't move very far so I can't really do much, but they can also move, and this is the preferred way of working if you're working psycho biologically. Hi, Judy, thank you for… I just got to make sure you guys don't roll off the stage. And so ordinarily I would not be boxed in like this, I'd like to be able to move back, and then we'll move forward, and then we all move over here, and move over here, all for a purpose, all for emphasis. I can't do that here because I'm blocked, but I will do the best we can. I want to thank you guys for coming up and could just have you guys come just a little bit closer to each other being mindful of the edge there. Now I only know a little bit about what happened, but as I understand it there's an emergency right now. 

00:06:15
JUDY Yes. 

00:06:15
STAN TATKIN Could you, do you want to say, either of you want to say what it is that's happened? 

00:06:20
JUDY Yes. We have been like the foster grandparents. My son who took on a therapeutic foster child when he was about six and JJ is now 31, shot himself in the head last night, and is brain dead, and dying. 

00:06:55
STAN TATKIN And dying. Where is he right now, like I assume he's not local, he's not… 

00:07:00
BRUCE No, hello, hello, can you hear? 

00:07:00
STAN TATKIN Can you folks hear? 

00:07:05
AUDIENCE No. 

00:07:05
BRUCE It's on. 

00:07:05
STAN TATKIN Oh, his mike is, we're not getting anything. 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN The mike is on. 

00:07:10
BRUCE Testing, testing. 

00:07:10
STAN TATKIN Its right there and we just move it, let me just move it for you. Let's see if that's, if that's better. Try now or you might want to hold it even, you wanna… 

00:07:25
BRUCE Test. Test, test, test. 

00:07:25
STAN TATKIN It's dead, nothing. Okay… 

00:07:30
JUDY Want to use this, probably fix this thing. 

00:07:35
STAN TATKIN It would be better, than, this way you don't have to, otherwise it's like a talking stick… 

00:07:40
[sil.] 

00:07:45
STAN TATKIN Mike, you just want to switch off the mike. 

00:07:50
UNKNOWN We're gonna give you one 'cause you're, keep going in, we can use this one, but we don't have another one with us… 

00:07:55
STAN TATKIN Yeah, I want you to do this one, I'll take that, 

00:08:00
[sil.] 

00:08:45
STAN TATKIN Is that okay? 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:08:50
[sil.] 

00:09:00
STAN TATKIN Sorry. 

00:09:00
BRUCE You want this back? 

00:09:05
[sil.] 

00:09:10
STAN TATKIN All right, talking, talking, testing, testing, testing… 

00:09:15
[sil.] 

00:09:20
STAN TATKIN Testing, testing, testing, so far nothing? 

00:09:20
UNKOWN No, I'm here. 

00:09:25
[sil.] 

00:09:30
STAN TATKIN Just doesn't stay. 

00:09:35
[sil.] 

00:09:40
STAN TATKIN There we go, can you hear? Really? I can hear everything. Okay, all right. All right, is he local or is he? 

00:09:50
BRUCE Anchorage, Alaska. 

00:09:55
STAN TATKIN Okay, so a ways away. That must be very hard for you both because you can't be there right now. 

00:10:05
JUDY Yes, both our sons are there, and they both were involved with JJ over these many years, and we were very involved with him, so they are there together, they're both at the hospital. They have each other for support otherwise we would have gone already. 

00:10:25
BRUCE We're scheduled to go Tuesday. We're leaving Tuesday for six weeks up there. 

00:10:30
STAN TATKIN Okay. 

00:10:30
JUDY And he won't be taken off life support until Tuesday. 

00:10:35
STAN TATKIN All right. I know you're so sad. 

00:10:35
JUDY I am very sad. It's heartbreaking, very, very, sad, we thought he was gonna make it. He came so far, he had some wonderful years, we gave him life that he never could have had, but that was hard to sustain when he became an adult. You know, it was like we bought him a car, he wrecks the car, you know, we do things for him, and then, you know, okay, maybe that approach isn't going to work, maybe that's enabling, we will try. You know, setting clearer boundaries. So he, he went back to his family of origin who had abused him sexually, physically in every way, and he go caught up in that system again, and that's where he died. 

00:11:55
STAN TATKIN I'm so sorry. When she's in distress like this what normally happens to you? 

00:12:00
BRUCE I move toward her, and I feel protective, and I close down some… 

00:12:15
STAN TATKIN That seem what he does mostly. Do you know why he does that, do you know why he closes down? There is no sound. Do you know why he does close down? 

00:12:35
[sil.] 

00:12:40
JUDY That's kind of the pattern in our relationship is that I bear the emotion, the pain, and he takes care of me, I don't know, get into my analysis, and that is the way of him living the pain vicariously instead of experiencing get himself. 

00:13:10
STAN TATKIN Does that make sense to you, you know, what she's talking about? 

00:13:10
BRUCE I do, vicariously didn't sound right. 

00:13:15
[sil.] 

00:13:20
STAN TATKIN I'm sorry. 

00:13:25
[sil.] 

00:13:35
BRUCE JJ is messing with us. 

00:13:40
[sil.] 

00:13:45
STAN TATKIN I'm just gonna continue on regardless of this 'cause you obviously do not look like you're feeling great. 

00:13:55
BRUCE No, I'm not. 

00:14:00
STAN TATKIN But you know what she's talking about when she says that she basically expresses the emotion for you, I think that's what you said 'cause you're a very sweet guy, I've been talking to you here, it's not like you're an unfeeling guy, you're very forward feeling. 

00:14:20
JUDY He's very sweet. He feels sweetness a lot. 

00:14:30
BRUCE I don't think it's accurate the she feels it for me. I think she feels it more, I mean she feels her, we each feel our pain in our own way. 

00:14:40
STAN TATKIN Right. 

00:14:40
BRUCE And… 

00:14:45
[sil.] 

00:14:50
STAN TATKIN Do you know does, does it come from a family that where there's a lot of emotional expression? 

00:15:00
BRUCE No. You ask her. 

00:15:05
STAN TATKIN I want to see if she knows. 

00:15:05
JUDY Oh, yeah, his, his both his mother and father were very bright conscientious, hard working, intellectual people who did good works. 

00:15:20
STAN TATKIN He seems very solid. 

00:15:25
JUDY Yeah. 

00:15:25
STAN TATKIN Yes. 

00:15:25
JUDY He does good works. 

00:15:30
STAN TATKIN But that's always been the thing between the two of you where one of you tends to be more emotional? 

00:15:35
JUDY We're switching some now, he actually cries more often than I do now, I mean our roles are really switching. 

00:15:45
BRUCE Starting to switch. 

00:15:45
JUDY In so many ways. 

00:15:45
BRUCE Right. 

00:15:45
JUDY It's just, you know, it's like at this conference. For example I'm talking to people and he's been more reserved, it used to be totally the opposite. 

00:16:00
STAN TATKIN The opposite. Were you were more reserved, more quite? 

00:16:00
JUDY Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. 

00:16:05
STAN TATKIN Okay, he's more out there. 

00:16:05
JUDY Yeah. 

00:16:05
STAN TATKIN Isn't that weird how it happened? 

00:16:05
JUDY It's so weird. 

00:16:05
STAN TATKIN There's a crossover. 

00:16:10
JUDY Yeah. 

00:16:10
STAN TATKIN So when he starts to tear up, what do you do? How do you, he says he starts to feel, what was it you said? You start you, when she's getting very tearful and very sad something happens to you, you, you what? 

00:16:25
BRUCE I move toward her. 

00:16:25
STAN TATKIN You do move toward her. 

00:16:30
BRUCE And I want to protect her and I close down my own feelings some. 

00:16:40
STAN TATKIN You close down your feelings in order to protect her? 

00:16:45
BRUCE Yes. I don't know, in order to be more present to her pain. 

00:16:50
STAN TATKIN So you know what he's talking about in terms of how to protect you. 

00:16:55
JUDY Yeah, yeah. 

00:16:55
BRUCE And that sounds awfully heavy, it's the best I can do right now. 

00:17:00
STAN TATKIN Right. What about now that he's becoming more emotional, what do you do with him? 

00:17:10
[sil.] 

00:17:15
JUDY My most familiar thing is to rub him on the shoulder, arm… 

00:17:25
STAN TATKIN And that's something he likes. 

00:17:25
JUDY Yeah, he loves it. 

00:17:30
STAN TATKIN That's true, right? 

00:17:30
BRUCE That's true. 

00:17:35
STAN TATKIN What are you most worried about with this event, what do you most worried about terms of Bruce? 

00:17:40
JUDY What am I most worried about? 

00:17:40
STAN TATKIN Yeah. 

00:17:45
[sil.] 

00:17:50
JUDY Well, I hadn't thought of it until on our way in to this room and he said, "I'm afraid I'll get it pressed." And I am afraid of his depression. He never, he's always been so bubbly and outgoing and optimistic, and whenever he gets depressed I get really scared. 

00:18:15
STAN TATKIN Do you know why she has this reaction, do you know why she gets care if you get depressed? 

00:18:20
[sil.] 

00:18:25
BRUCE I can imagine, but I don't. 

00:18:25
STAN TATKIN Does she have any reason, was there any event where you got very depressed? 

00:18:30
BRUCE No. 

00:18:30
STAN TATKIN And anything happened to her when she was younger, were someone was depressed, and maybe they left her, went, they weren't available? Any reason she'd be afraid of depression in the other that you know of 

00:18:50
BRUCE Yeah, her dad closed down and would get depressed, seriously depressed, just withdraw, just not talk for weeks, and there wasn't much anybody could do. It was, he never, he never, there's never any treatment or, but he would just close down and go about being on the farm, and doing farm chores, and never talk, and then he come back one day. 

00:19:20
STAN TATKIN And then didn't come back one day? 

00:19:20
BRUCE He did. 

00:19:25
STAN TATKIN He did come back. 

00:19:25
BRUCE Then yeah, happened, you describe it three or four or five time… 

00:19:30
JUDY Just mysteriously he'd be back all right. 

00:19:35
STAN TATKIN When you say he be back, you mean be out of the depression? 

00:19:35
JUDY Yeah. 

00:19:35
STAN TATKIN Okay. 

00:19:35
BRUCE No talking about it. 

00:19:40
JUDY Yeah. It was never discussed about what had happened. 

00:19:40
STAN TATKIN Right. How did your mother deal with him? 

00:19:45
JUDY She would cry and come to me and say, "I don't know what's wrong with your father. He won't talk to me. He just goes off and works in the field. I don't know what's wrong? I can't get him to talk." 

00:20:00
STAN TATKIN How old were you when she did that when she… 

00:20:00
JUDY All of my childhood. 

00:20:05
STAN TATKIN So when you were a little girl she would come, that's… 

00:20:05
JUDY Yeah. 

00:20:05
STAN TATKIN Reversing, right? 

00:20:10
JUDY Yeah. 

00:20:10
STAN TATKIN She would tell you her trouble. 

00:20:15
JUDY Yeah and I didn't know what to do. 

00:20:20
STAN TATKIN Of course not. 

00:20:20
JUDY I don't know what to do and Bruce it's pressed. 

00:20:25
STAN TATKIN How is he looking back at you right now, could you just able to show that for me? How is he looking back at you? 

00:20:35
JUDY Very lovingly. 

00:20:35
STAN TATKIN Do you see any signs of depression on his face? 

00:20:40
JUDY No. 

00:20:40
STAN TATKIN Are you accustomed to seeing depression on his face? 

00:20:45
JUDY No and I don't want to change. 

00:20:50
STAN TATKIN I know. So you're remembering something from someone in the past, your father, but you don't have an experience where Bruce has gone missing. 

00:21:05
JUDY Occasionally for a little while, it's like the worst part is when he is physically disabled, like with his knee surgery, he goes into like for about a month he was really depressed, and we're kind of joined at the hip… 

00:21:25
STAN TATKIN Yes. Where he goes, you go. 

00:21:30
JUDY Yeah. 

00:21:30
STAN TATKIN Where you go, he goes. You knew this, right that it was, when you had your knee surgery and you were depressed, she says you were depressed, that it was hard on her, do you knew that? 

00:21:45
BRUCE I would've called that depression, but then I'm not a very good judge. I, I, I hate opioids and I didn't like, I tried to use the drugs as little as possible when I had more pain than needed, and then I used it, and then getting off of it was just awful, but I wouldn't call it depression, I call it… 

00:22:10
JUDY Withdrawal. 

00:22:10
BRUCE Withdrawal, yeah. 

00:22:15
STAN TATKIN So you had to go through that, you had to go through the whole thing. 

00:22:15
BRUCE Yeah. 

00:22:15
STAN TATKIN How long did that last for? 

00:22:20
JUDY Couple of months. 

00:22:25
STAN TATKIN Couple of months. 

00:22:25
BRUCE Three. 

00:22:25
STAN TATKIN Three months, okay. 

00:22:25
BRUCE Three, four. 

00:22:30
STAN TATKIN Has she ever gone through any spells of depression at all that you know of with you? 

00:22:35
[sil.] 

00:22:40
BRUCE I absolutely do not know. I would, I would say no, but that doesn't seem possible. 

00:22:45
STAN TATKIN Well, she's worried that you'll fall into depression. What are you worried about with her? 

00:22:50
BRUCE That she will work and busy herself in a way that doesn't, she doesn't get to do the things she loves and wants to do. 

00:23:10
STAN TATKIN She would busy herself and not be able to get to the things that she loves. 

00:23:15
BRUCE And wants to do. 

00:23:15
STAN TATKIN Which would be what? 

00:23:15
BRUCE Writing, painting. 

00:23:20
[sil.] 

00:23:30
JUDY Reading. 

00:23:30
STAN TATKIN Reading. What about being with you, would it prevent her from being with you if she was so busy to try to stay afloat? 

00:23:35
BRUCE I can almost keep up with her. We're going to almost stay together during that. 

00:23:40
STAN TATKIN So she wouldn't leave you being busy as she tried to cope with her grief? 

00:23:45
BRUCE No. 

00:23:50
[sil.] 

00:23:55
BRUCE I do, she loses track of herself, so then I, we keep each other… I can reach across that chasm… 

00:24:10
STAN TATKIN Fairly easily? 

00:24:15
BRUCE Yeah. 

00:24:15
STAN TATKIN Is that true for you? 

00:24:20
BRUCE It gets difficult if it's too often, that's when I start getting grumpy. 

00:24:25
JUDY Yeah and I like to be with him. So when he calls me I usually come. 

00:24:35
STAN TATKIN How long have you guys been together? How long? 

00:24:40
BRUCE Fifty two years. 

00:24:40
STAN TATKIN Fifty two years, wow, and married for how many years? 

00:24:45
JUDY Fifty two. 

00:24:45
BRUCE Fifty two. 

00:24:45
JUDY We got married right away. 

00:24:45
BRUCE We've been together 53 years. 

00:24:50
JUDY We got married shortly after we met. 

00:24:50
STAN TATKIN shortly after you met. And how did you meet? 

00:24:55
[sil.] 

00:25:00
BRUCE I was… 

00:25:00
STAN TATKIN She's staring at to you. 

00:25:00
BRUCE Yeah, I saw that. I was in a summer camp in Michigan. There's a summer, summer camp that stuck around, everybody predicted it wouldn't last. 

00:25:15
STAN TATKIN Whose everybody? 

00:25:15
BRUCE Camp director, friends… 

00:25:20
JUDY My relatives. 

00:25:20
STAN TATKIN Your relatives. 

00:25:20
BRUCE My parents, so they knew the first time they got the letter, your parents had this, her parents, she's from Georgia and I was from Boston, and they were, when she went up there they said, "Why don't you go up there and marry a Yankee? So I felt real welcome when I got down there. 

00:25:40
STAN TATKIN From Boston 'cause I can hear an accent with you, southern accent. 

00:25:45
BRUCE Yeah, I got a little. 

00:25:45
STAN TATKIN Little bit. And so when you guys met, what made you pick this guy? 

00:25:55
JUDY I picked him the year before, before I ever met him. My roommate, I was there for two weeks camping experience in college. And my roommate was dating him and she was, no, she had just met him, and she was breaking up with a very handsome guy to get together with Bruce and she talked about him in such glowing terms and I decided I'm coming back to this camp next year and meet somebody like him. And when I arrived on campus his name was on the list. And I said, "Oh, well, he'll do." 

00:26:35
STAN TATKIN He'll do? Was there any other criteria other than that? Anything else about him maybe that's… 

00:26:50
JUDY Well, yes she had, she had laid out, I mean she talked about his family, his father was, you know, a teacher in the camp, a den fourth scholar, Bruce was this, you know, student body president, and he was just, she talked about him in such glowing terms, I grew up on the farm, I had not been many places, I'd been to Daytona Beach and to Michigan. And he was very worldly and Family was very different, I wanted that. 

00:27:20
STAN TATKIN You wanted that? The worldly part? 

00:27:25
JUDY Yes. 

00:27:25
STAN TATKIN Okay, what else, the family is different, what else about him? Why this guy? 

00:27:30
JUDY Well, I mean if I had seen him, and met him, and didn't feel the chemistry it would have been very different, but as soon as I laid eyes on him, and I came back from the first outing, and said to my roommates "If, if he'll ask me, I'm going to marry that guy." I mean, so it was… 

00:28:00
STAN TATKIN Nice. 

00:28:00
JUDY The chemistry was there and he was handsome and… 

00:28:05
STAN TATKIN Still is now. 

00:28:05
JUDY Yeah. He's gorgeous. He never knew it, still doesn't. 

00:28:15
STAN TATKIN He still doesn't think so? 

00:28:15
BRUCE I began to believe her after 20 years. One day we were somewhere and it was that moment and I said, "When you first laid eyes on me I know you knew you wanted to marry me, but did you find me handsome?" And I was afraid to ask them for 20 years and she said, "Yes." And I just melted, that was really, I… 

00:28:45
STAN TATKIN I can see it on your face and your eyes. 

00:28:45
BRUCE Yeah, I never felt that. I never was one of the… 

00:28:55
JUDY And I want you to know I gave him hell for many years in our relationship. 

00:29:00
STAN TATKIN When you say gave him hell, what do you mean? 

00:29:05
JUDY In family therapy our kids said that I was the witch. 

00:29:10
STAN TATKIN Oh. 

00:29:10
JUDY This was with Frank Pittman that I was the witch and he was the Wimp. 

00:29:15
STAN TATKIN The Witch and The Wimp? 

00:29:15
BRUCE Yup. 

00:29:20
STAN TATKIN That's nice alliteration. 

00:29:20
JUDY But I have mellowed. 

00:29:20
STAN TATKIN Right. 

00:29:20
JUDY And now I just adore him. 

00:29:25
STAN TATKIN How long did it take you from going from witch to really adoring him? 

00:29:30
JUDY It started that day when they said that. 

00:29:30
STAN TATKIN I see. 

00:29:30
JUDY And that was 30 years ago. 

00:29:35
STAN TATKIN Thirty years ago? Good. So did he change from being the wimp then? You said you changed. 

00:29:45
JUDY Yeah, he did. He… 

00:29:50
STAN TATKIN You didn't think of yourself as a wimp though, did you? 

00:29:55
BRUCE In the presence of her criticism and anger, I did. Well, I would get frantic. 

00:30:05
STAN TATKIN Get frantic. 

00:30:05
BRUCE I don't know it wouldn't be the right one, when the kid said that Frank asked, our oldest, and he said, She's the, I thought it was bitch, but… 

00:30:15
JUDY No, it was witch. 

00:30:20
BRUCE We don't know each other that well. And he, he said she's the witch and I'm the whim, we were both stunned, I mean I was stunned, and terribly, I mean where the hell did that come from? 

00:30:35
STAN TATKIN Right. 

00:30:35
BRUCE And then he asked our younger son, four years younger, he said, "You agree?" "Oh, yeah…" I mean, that boom, boom, changed, changed. 

00:30:45
STAN TATKIN Right. 

00:30:45
BRUCE It gave us a new angle on therapy. 

00:30:50
STAN TATKIN Did you think that she was witch also? Did you agree with the kids? 

00:30:55
BRUCE I guess I thought she was a bitch. 

00:30:55
STAN TATKIN That's what you bitch, okay, that's why, now I know, right. 

00:31:00
BRUCE But a very lovely. 

00:31:05
STAN TATKIN But a very lovely bitch. 

00:31:05
BRUCE My kind of bitch. 

00:31:05
STAN TATKIN Yeah, my kind of bitch. Judías. So, okay, so, I take it when you got married to her that's not how you thought of her or when you met her, right? So what, what drew you to this filly? 

00:31:25
BRUCE I was, I was, I was just stunned. I was, for, you know, in the camp I was, we were playing bridge, and I was the dummy, and had laid the hand down, and she walked up behind us, and said, "What you all doing?" And I turned around and I said, "My God where do you come from?" And when I turned around and looked up, the sun was up there behind her, and I just, I don't know… 

00:31:55
STAN TATKIN The image. 

00:32:00
BRUCE I have that image last in my heart. 

00:32:00
STAN TATKIN Still? 

00:32:00
BRUCE Yeah. 

00:32:00
STAN TATKIN Yeah. 

00:32:00
BRUCE And she said, "Georgia." And I, I only knew two things about George I said, "You live on a plantation?" And she said, "No, a farm." 

00:32:15
STAN TATKIN Farm, yeah. 

00:32:15
BRUCE And I had both grandparents lived in Kansas on the farm, we spent all summers there, my brother and I worked through college in the hay field. So that was and then I said, "Do you drink Mint julep?" And she said, "What's that?" And I, that was it, I closed the deal. Farm girl don't know about Mint julep is like an… 

00:32:40
STAN TATKIN Now when say you're farm girl, did you, like real farm or you had the farming duties and everything with animals and stuff like that? 

00:32:45
JUDY I worked in the fields. 

00:32:45
STAN TATKIN You did, okay. Has he ever done anything like that? 

00:32:50
JUDY Oh, he loves it. 

00:32:50
STAN TATKIN Nice. 

00:32:50
JUDY He drove my father's tractor after my father couldn't drive it. He loved it. We'd come down from the city and Bruce get on the tractor, and do what needed to be done. Daddy bought him a new tractor. 

00:33:10
BRUCE Boys love tractors. 

00:33:15
STAN TATKIN Is this the, I mean this is a big tragedy, is this the only tragedy that the two of you have survived? 

00:33:20
JUDY No. 

00:33:20
STAN TATKIN What else? 

00:33:25
JUDY My nephew at age 20, same age as JJ, he would be 31 now, but at 20 he was killed, stabbed in the heart, and… 

00:33:40
STAN TATKIN You mean murdered? 

00:33:45
JUDY Murdered, and my sister, and her husband and my niece, we all still suffer with that. Most of us have gone on with our lives, Evans bother has been an terrible, terrible chronic pain. So he is not doing well, 11 years after JJ and Evan… 

00:34:20
BRUCE Love… 

00:34:20
JUDY Were together, yeah, they had a love hate relationship, JJ had a big tattoo on his arm after Evan died of Evan, you know, Evan's name. But yeah, it brought the family closer, all of us. 

00:34:40
STAN TATKIN What about the two of you? 

00:34:45
JUDY Yeah. Bruce was wonderful during that tragedy and very supportive of my whole family, and you had your own grief, he loved Evan. 

00:35:00
STAN TATKIN Great. So that's another tragedy, any others? Is that… 

00:35:05
BRUCE Our son had two friends who committed suicide. We're thinking of, we thought of him, I've tried to call him to, our younger son. 

00:35:15
STAN TATKIN What's his first name? 

00:35:15
BRUCE Damon. 

00:35:20
STAN TATKIN Damon, okay. 

00:35:20
BRUCE And so this is third suicide, and his life plus Evan, they were very close. Evan spent the last year of his life living with him to get sober. Our son's been in recovery for many years. So Evan went up there to get sober and was sober for a year blossom, and then he came back, went back to college, and first night he went out and got drunk, he got in a fight, he got stabbed. So considerably… 

00:35:55
STAN TATKIN It's still, it's still affecting you strongly? 

00:36:00
JUDY Yeah. Oh, yeah. 

00:36:00
STAN TATKIN We can see, I can see. 

00:36:05
JUDY And this, you know, brings up that grief. 

00:36:05
STAN TATKIN Yes, of course of course. 

00:36:10
[sil.] 

00:36:15
STAN TATKIN Can I have the two of you move even closer together and if it's okay you can put, you can put this thing just right here or in your pocket so you don't have to deal with it with your hands. 

00:36:30
BRUCE Good. 

00:36:30
STAN TATKIN There you go. And could you just take a moment without talking, I just want to see the two of you in each other's eyes for of just a few moments? I'm actually looking for something if you don't mind. 

00:36:45
[sil.] 

00:37:25
STAN TATKIN And, Judy, as you look into Bruce's eyes, do you like the way he's looking back at you right now? What about it, what about the ways looking at you, do you like? 

00:37:45
[sil.] 

00:37:50
JUDY People in the grocery line sometimes say to him you have happy eyes. 

00:37:55
STAN TATKIN It's around here, right? 

00:38:00
JUDY And… 

00:38:05
[sil.] 

00:38:10
STAN TATKIN Does it look to you as you look at him, does it look to you like he loves you? 

00:38:15
JUDY Oh, yeah. 

00:38:20
[sil.] 

00:38:25
JUDY Yeah, I know that, you know, it tells, you know, it's just… 

00:38:40
STAN TATKIN As you look at Bruce do you trust him with your life? 

00:38:45
JUDY Yeah and my grief. 

00:38:50
[sil.] 

00:38:55
JUDY I mean there were a few improvements. 

00:39:00
STAN TATKIN Stare, stare, stare into his eyes. Stay there, stay… And, Bruce, as you look at Judy, do you like the way she's looking back at you? 

00:39:10
BRUCE Yes. 

00:39:10
STAN TATKIN What about the way she's looking at you, do you like? 

00:39:15
BRUCE Soft, embracing. 

00:39:20
STAN TATKIN Soft and… 

00:39:20
BRUCE Embracing. 

00:39:20
STAN TATKIN Embracing. 

00:39:20
BRUCE And… 

00:39:25
[sil.] 

00:39:30
BRUCE Constant. 

00:39:30
STAN TATKIN And constant. And do you trust her with your life? 

00:39:35
BRUCE Yes. 

00:39:40
[sil.] 

00:39:45
STAN TATKIN She's a little bit afraid that you'll leave her in some way that you'll get depressed like her daddy and that you'll leave, you see it right now, you see your face shift? This is a big deal to her. What do you do for her when she's in this state, when she's in this worry about you going away being depressed, and her being left, and not knowing how to deal with you? 

00:40:20
[sil.] 

00:40:25
STAN TATKIN How do you help her? 

00:40:30
BRUCE Well, I go away in little ways like last night. 

00:40:35
STAN TATKIN You went away last night? 

00:40:35
BRUCE Yeah, sitting in the room, just, I just came out of a whole day of processing here, I went out and I just, I said I wanted to wedge, but then I sat there for four hours. She was exhausted and trying to sleep and I was keeping her awake. But I went away, I wasn't available, and I knew it. 

00:41:00
STAN TATKIN How are you keeping her awake if you were wedging? 

00:41:05
BRUCE You're married? 

00:41:10
STAN TATKIN Yes. 

00:41:10
BRUCE Okay. You have to ask… 

00:41:15
STAN TATKIN Well, wedging usually is pretty quiet. 

00:41:15
BRUCE Well, yeah, it is until you get ready for bed and then go to brush the teeth and… 

00:41:20
STAN TATKIN I see, then you walk around. 

00:41:20
BRUCE Yeah. 

00:41:20
JUDY He had the TV on. 

00:41:20
BRUCE I had the TV on. 

00:41:25
STAN TATKIN Okay. 

00:41:25
BRUCE I put it on silent after her complaining… 

00:41:25
STAN TATKIN But the light still flashes and… 

00:41:30
BRUCE Yeah and then I was watching, I was watching whatever's on, she woke up and looked at it and said, "Let's off, how could you watch that shit?" So we had… 

00:41:45
STAN TATKIN And then went back to sleep, right? 

00:41:45
BRUCE Yeah, but it was… 

00:41:45
JUDY Until the next time he woke me up. 

00:41:50
BRUCE Yeah and then I was, it was just one of them, I like to read before I go to sleep. 

00:41:55
STAN TATKIN She's worried that you'll get depressed and you'll be disabled in a way that she won't be able to handle. 

00:42:05
JUDY Yeah or die. 

00:42:05
STAN TATKIN Or die. 

00:42:10
BRUCE Coming into the room I told her that in response to JJs news at noon we got a call that I felt close down and cold, and I coming into the room I said I wonder if I'm depressed. I don't, I haven't done depression in my life, I've done, I've had some pretty wild moments in life, but not depression as I see it. But I've been feeling it, I've been feeling my age, and feeling less vital. And it was like I, I couldn't look to see him. 

00:43:05
[sil.] 

00:43:05
STAN TATKIN This in? 

00:43:05
BRUCE The JJ, the news. 

00:43:10
STAN TATKIN Right. How come you don't, how can, s stay with her, stay with her eyes. How come you didn't wake her up and have her wedge with you or just be with her and feeling overwhelmed? 

00:43:25
[sil.] 

00:43:30
STAN TATKIN Is a somebody? 

00:43:30
BRUCE It's not, not something I do well. 

00:43:35
STAN TATKIN Not something you do. 

00:43:35
BRUCE Easily, easily. 

00:43:35
STAN TATKIN Right. 

00:43:35
BRUCE I do. 

00:43:35
STAN TATKIN Would you say that's true, he doesn't make good use of you when he's in distress? 

00:43:45
JUDY Right. 

00:43:45
STAN TATKIN Is he alone or takes care of himself? 

00:43:45
JUDY Right. 

00:43:45
STAN TATKIN Doesn't ask for help? So I can see why you might be worried about him because he's alone a lot. 

00:44:00
JUDY Yeah. 

00:44:05
STAN TATKIN What do you do to help him with that? His tendency to be by him self to take care of himself to not be a bother, not be a pain. 

00:44:15
[sil.] 

00:44:20
JUDY Well, I invite him like for instance… 

00:44:30
[sil.] 

00:44:35
JUDY He has some addictive habits. And when… 

00:44:45
STAN TATKIN Especially when he's alone? 

00:44:45
JUDY Yeah, mostly, and he used to go to the grocery store, and I know now he would always be ready to go the grocery store because he'd buy, then, in those days, the old days a half gallon of ice cream. 

00:45:00
STAN TATKIN Oh, man of my own heart. 

00:45:05
JUDY Eat it in the parking lot, throw it in the trash, and come home, and eat dinner. And so as the years have gone by and I learned more and more about that, I would say to him, "Bring your ice-cream home, sweet heart." 

00:45:20
STAN TATKIN Nice. 

00:45:20
JUDY "Bring your ice-cream home and if I'm not here, you eat it, leave it in the sink for me to see, don't speak it. It's okay." But for many years before I had given him a lot of grief… 

00:45:40
STAN TATKIN I see. 

00:45:40
JUDY About eating ice-cream because he was overweight. 

00:45:45
STAN TATKIN You worried about him. 

00:45:45
JUDY I always worried about him and I just ragged on him about it, but I changed that, and he still sometimes sneaks things no matter how much I invite him, no matter how much I am sympathetic when he tells me one of his shameful secrets, he just doesn't get through, I want to be with you. 

00:46:15
[sil.] 

00:46:20
STAN TATKIN Is it okay if he gets ice-cream with you? 

00:46:25
JUDY Yeah. 

00:46:25
STAN TATKIN Do you know why you don't do that, Bruce? 

00:46:30
BRUCE Oh, I do. 

00:46:30
STAN TATKIN You do. 

00:46:30
BRUCE Sure. 

00:46:30
STAN TATKIN You don't. 

00:46:30
JUDY No. 

00:46:30
STAN TATKIN Now you do, so you don't throw out the… the… 

00:46:35
BRUCE And I also sneak it too. 

00:46:35
STAN TATKIN Do you know why you sneak it? 

00:46:40
BRUCE I would love to know why I sneak it. 

00:46:40
STAN TATKIN Well, you're sneaking it from her otherwise you'd be no sneaking, right? 

00:46:50
BRUCE I remember all my life being terrified of being caught. 

00:46:55
STAN TATKIN Right. 

00:46:55
BRUCE When Judy quit criticizing, literally made a decision, and quit criticize, it took me five or six years if there is any blip in a relationship I would, I would be drawn up waiting… 

00:47:10
STAN TATKIN For something. 

00:47:10
BRUCE Yeah and it didn't happen and after five years of look nice, well twp years otherwise I'll let my shoulders down little bit. But even to this day it is so familiar, so ingrained, so deep in me to, to try to, to do what I, you know, to just do the things that the I don't think are so wrong when I was a kid now I'm now thinking, you know, mature school just going out and playing and coming in and getting scolded, just, so I'd have to have some, I'd make up stories about how it was all right. I mean I was with so and so, you don't just…" 

00:48:00
STAN TATKIN Is it fair to say that that, it's getting late in the game to have to spend so many resources to hide with your girl? I mean being that she knows anyway when did it be better for you to proudly eat your ice-cream to even tell her I'm sitting in the car, eating my ice cream just so she knows. 

00:48:20
BRUCE That would be something. 

00:48:25
STAN TATKIN Yeah. 

00:48:30
BRUCE (inaudible) she'd say, "Where are you? I want some." 

00:48:35
JUDY Yeah, I'm liking ice-cream more and more. 

00:48:35
BRUCE I know. 

00:48:40
STAN TATKIN She's worried that your tendency to distance and to take care of yourself and to be ashamed of needing asking, demanding is what's going to lead you to be depressed 'cause I take it your father didn't, wasn't a talker, wasn't somebody who reached out, well, he just took care of it himself. 

00:49:00
JUDY Took care of it himself. 

00:49:00
STAN TATKIN Right. 

00:49:05
[sil.] 

00:49:10
STAN TATKIN Again she's worried about you right now, she's worried about you, maybe it's not just you, maybe it's her fear about what happens when there's a tragedy, but you haven't said anything to reassure her do you know why? 

00:49:25
[sil.] 

00:49:35
STAN TATKIN Stay with her. Could you reassure her? 

00:49:40
BRUCE Have I not? 

00:49:40
STAN TATKIN Nope, not yet. 

00:49:45
[sil.] 

00:49:50
BRUCE Well… 

00:49:55
STAN TATKIN Could you look at her, look in her eyes for a moment just to stay in her eyes for a moment, and I want you to say something right after I tell you to say it. I will never leave you, go. 

00:50:05
BRUCE I will never leave you. 

00:50:10
[sil.] 

00:50:15
STAN TATKIN As you look her, does she believe you? 

00:50:20
BRUCE Well… 

00:50:20
STAN TATKIN Does she believe you? 

00:50:20
BRUCE Unless I die, I don't know how to. 

00:50:20
STAN TATKIN But that's one of the thing she's worried about, you're not take care of yourself which includes using her, making use of her. 

00:50:25
JUDY Yeah. 

00:50:30
[sil.] 

00:50:35
STAN TATKIN Would you say she did believe you or she didn't? 

00:50:40
BRUCE Oh, I saw that puzzle look and I, I thought it was the same puzzle I had because I don't, because, one of us will die one day first. 

00:50:50
STAN TATKIN Right. 

00:50:50
BRUCE Probably. 

00:50:50
STAN TATKIN But you need to be talking about that now. She just wants to be reassured as do you that you're sticking around. 

00:51:10
BRUCE I'm absolutely sticking around. We're in this together. We're in this together period. 

00:51:20
STAN TATKIN And does she believe you? 

00:51:25
BRUCE Looks like there's still a little something that… 

00:51:30
STAN TATKIN Is he right? 

00:51:35
JUDY There's a little something, there's… 

00:51:35
BRUCE May I guess? Is that I may withdraw for a while. 

00:51:45
STAN TATKIN What's a while? 

00:51:45
BRUCE A night, afternoon, you may be feared, afraid of more but that's not the right way as I see it. And when you asked me before what did I do for reassurance, I didn't say but it was quite a while ago I always come back. I always show up. 

00:52:15
JUDY You do. 

00:52:15
BRUCE And that I can… 

00:52:15
STAN TATKIN But, you know, she suffers in the interim, right? You may feel, okay, although I don't think you are okay, I think you think you're okay, it is something you're familiar with, but she's not. 

00:52:35
BRUCE Wow. 

00:52:35
STAN TATKIN While you are wedging and while you are taking her time to take care of yourself, she's suffering. 

00:52:45
BRUCE And I've started the wedging of these last four years since I retired. 

00:52:50
STAN TATKIN Judy, Judy do you think that's a good, stay with him, do you think it's a, it's a good idea for him to withdraw as much as he does or for as long as he does? 

00:53:00
JUDY No. 

00:53:00
STAN TATKIN So you don't believe it's good for him. 

00:53:00
JUDY No. 

00:53:05
STAN TATKIN And it's not good for you. 

00:53:05
JUDY No. 

00:53:05
STAN TATKIN So what are you going to do the next time he does that? 

00:53:10
JUDY The thing that comes to my mind is just go get in his lap and say, "Come back to me." Or, "How long do you need?" 

00:53:30
STAN TATKIN If you ask him that question that will be useful. 

00:53:35
BRUCE I like the first. 

00:53:35
STAN TATKIN Yeah. Don't forget he loses when he is in that state of mind he loses track of time and space. 

00:53:40
JUDY Yes, he does. 

00:53:40
STAN TATKIN Yeah, right. You don't, he does. 

00:53:45
BRUCE Truly. 

00:53:45
JUDY Right. 

00:53:45
STAN TATKIN Yeah 'cause it's the way he took care of himself from childhood, he self-stimulates himself soon. 

00:53:50
JUDY Right. Yeah, right on. 

00:53:55
STAN TATKIN Yeah and it's a dissociative state, right? 

00:53:55
JUDY Yes. 

00:53:55
BRUCE Yup. 

00:54:00
STAN TATKIN So would you pull him out and say, "Five minutes and then you're with me." 

00:54:05
JUDY That sounds good. 

00:54:10
BRUCE It actually sounds good to me. In fact I'm the alarm setter in our family, I use my phone for the alarm, I'd would be glad if you say five minutes, let me put it on phone, put it on my phone. 

00:54:25
JUDY You want a timer? 

00:54:25
BRUCE Yeah, I like the timer. 

00:54:25
STAN TATKIN But you're going to be the one to get him out. 

00:54:30
BRUCE At least set the alarm. 

00:54:30
JUDY Yeah, yeah, that's what I thought. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. 

00:54:40
BRUCE Nice, that I'd set the alarm. 

00:54:40
JUDY Oh, no, I set the alarm. 

00:54:40
BRUCE Damn! 

00:54:45
[sil.] 

00:54:50
BRUCE Wow. Now I didn't know you were that scared. 

00:55:00
[sil.] 

00:55:05
JUDY And we'll have a lot of work to do when we get to Alaska. 

00:55:10
BRUCE Yeah, we will. 

00:55:10
JUDY And I need you. 

00:55:10
BRUCE Oh, yeah. 

00:55:15
[sil.] 

00:55:15
JUDY Don't leave me alone. 

00:55:20
[sil.] 

00:55:25
STAN TATKIN When you see and hear Judy what happens to you, what happens to you, what is your body want to do, do you want to move back, do you want to move forward, you want to get out of here? 

00:55:40
BRUCE No, no. 

00:55:40
JUDY I like to rub. 

00:55:45
BRUCE No, I like the distance. 

00:55:45
STAN TATKIN You like the distance? 

00:55:45
BRUCE I like, I like the, I like right where we are. 

00:55:50
STAN TATKIN Where you are, okay. 

00:55:55
BRUCE And then metaphorically in many ways. 

00:55:55
STAN TATKIN Do put each other to bed at night? 

00:56:00
[sil.] 

00:56:05
JUDY That was one thing Bruce ask of me some years ago was when I got ready to go to bed and he was still doing things, would I please come and give him a goodnight kiss… 

00:56:25
STAN TATKIN You can groom if you wish. She can groom you. 

00:56:30
BRUCE All right. 

00:56:35
JUDY And then rather than just disappearing, though that was the kind of talking and, you know, to come and say good night… 

00:56:40
STAN TATKIN 'Cause when he's off alone at night he gets lost. 

00:56:45
JUDY Yeah, he does. 

00:56:50
STAN TATKIN It's like, "Yay, I'm free." But he's also lost. 

00:56:50
JUDY Right. 

00:56:50
BRUCE This was a different one though, we would be in the same room and she should go to bed, and then I'd be sitting on the stair waiting to say goodnight or something and then she didn't come down so I go upstairs and the bedroom door would be closed. And so I really would panic then, then there was an abandonment. 

00:57:15
STAN TATKIN Right. 

00:57:15
BRUCE Which I was very familiar with my childhood too. So I asked her once to come and say goodnight, look me in the eye, make eye contact and say goodnight, and then you did it, you did that very well. 

00:57:30
STAN TATKIN You guys try for just the next few days as a science experiments as you're going through so much stress, to go to bed together even though you're a later person you can read to each other, you can pray together, you can wish your kids well, you can wish people well together, but nighttime and morning are the two most vulnerable times for children and adults 

00:57:55
JUDY Yeah. 

00:57:55
BRUCE Yeah. That sounds good. 

00:58:00
STAN TATKIN Now's the time to hold together and to really protect each other, have each other's backs especially when you go up north. 

00:58:10
JUDY Right. 

00:58:10
BRUCE Yeah. 

00:58:15
[sil.] 

00:58:20
STAN TATKIN You guys are so sweet. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. 

00:58:20
JUDY Yeah, we'll have to bury JJ. 

00:58:25
STAN TATKIN I'm so sorry. 

00:58:30
[sil.] 

00:58:35
STAN TATKIN I going to guess that she's somebody who needs right, more than you, you always want to move forward on her… 

00:58:40
BRUCE Okay. 

00:58:40
STAN TATKIN To calm her down, to soothe her always forward, and her embracing, the embrace, not so much for him although he benefits from it, there's one more trickery with him, but this is how she works. 

00:59:05
[sil.] 

00:59:15
JUDY Now you. 

00:59:15
STAN TATKIN Oh, of course. 

00:59:20
[sil.] 

00:59:30
STAN TATKIN I want to thank you both so much. 

00:59:35
BRUCE Oh, thank you. 

00:59:35
JUDY Thank you. 

00:59:35
STAN TATKIN I have to do this and like I said I want to spend time you, I have to oversee it. I'm not sure there's any time for, we're… 

00:59:45
BRUCE No. 

00:59:45
STAN TATKIN Over for questions. I'm so sorry. If you want I'll be available, you can talk to me. If you are here tomorrow, if you have comments about tonight, tomorrow on the workshop please come and we can continue talking about it 'cause I don't want to make you late for whatever else you're doing now.
