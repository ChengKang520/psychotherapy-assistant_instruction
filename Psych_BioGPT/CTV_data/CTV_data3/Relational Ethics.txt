Relational Ethics with Sheila McNamee Ph.D. Peggy Sax Ph.D. 

00:00:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE Hi, I'm Sheila McNamee. 

00:00:10
PEGGY SAX And I'm Peggy Sax. 

00:00:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE We want to talk about relational ethics today, and uh, you know, we're really curious. We both have approached this topic in our work, um, and we want to talk about a different way of thinking about ethics in practice from a relational constructionist point of view. 

00:00:35
PEGGY SAX And I, uh, had the opportunity to read an article this morning, re-read an article that you, Sheila, wrote. So it's very fresh in my mind, about the, um, some thinking and implications for psychotherapy of relational ethics. And I think, for me, both as a teacher, but primarily as a practitioner of with a license as a psychologist, the ideas that you wrote about are very thought-provoking and very affirming. You put words to things that many of us, um, would like, wish that we could say. Well, well you say, in fact, in one, one thing, that little quote that I love, is about will you draw the distinction about, is the right thing equivalent to the legal thing? Um, and I wondered if you . . . Well, I hadn't planned on starting there, but I wonder if we could even begin there? When you wrote about, um, "Postmodern Psychotherapeutic Ethics, Relational Responsibility and Practice" is the name of the article that I have in front of me here. And maybe before you, uh, respond to that, can you just talk a little bit about why you chose to write that, this particular article? Do you remember what? Because there's so many things to write about. 

00:01:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE Hmm. Yeah, well. I mean, I can, I can tell you exactly why that article, but there's even a deeper story about writing about ethics, for me started with, uh, when again, Ken Gergen and I wrote the book "Relational Responsibility". And that emerged from what I, what I call a naive critique of social construction that many, many, many people have which basically says, you know, you construct your world. You can construct it any way you want. You can do whatever you want. There's no, that's, that's unethical. It's irresponsible. It's, uh, you know, there's, there's nothing, no tether to the ground basically. 

00:02:45
PEGGY SAX Right. 

00:02:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE And so I started in my teaching, I just started using this term "relational responsibility". And, and I started thinking about it, and Ken and I started talking about it, and that book emerged. But it really was a response to that critique that a constructionist's approach is, has no ethic. And the idea is, you know, we take, we move away from the idea of individual responsibility and we look at relational responsibility which is attentiveness to the process of relating itself. 

00:03:20
PEGGY SAX Ah ha. 

00:03:20
Relational Ethics from a Realational Constructionist Approach 

00:03:20
Responsibility, Ethics and Morality 

00:03:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE So we're looking at something different. We're not looking at what your responsible for, bring it back to your professional versus your gut when you sit with clients. It's not like, oh my, the ethical code of my license, what am I supposed to do? What did my training tell me to do? Me, me, me, what I need to do. But more a sense of, you know, what are we doing here? And we're looking at the process which includes all of that stuff. It's not just the gut, it's then, what are we making together? How are we making it? How is this unfolding? So that was the beginning of, um, that project. And that has been the thread throughout all of my work, is, is really trying to address this issue of responsibility and ethics and morality. So this particular article was written for, uh, a conference in Torino, Italy that was on postmodern psychotherapeutic, uh, ethics in clinical practice. And, it wasn't actually written, I gave a talk. And then was, uh, asked if I would, could write it up. And so of course this is entirely different, somewhat similar to what I talked about. That's where this came from and that's why I wrote it. 

00:04:45
Relativism and Relational Ethics 

00:04:50
PEGGY SAX And, I just want to make sure I'm understanding that you . . . I hear you drawing a distinction between relational ethics and relativism, which is what social construction theory has sometimes been, um, was back in those days, sort of, uh, questioned about. Is that? 

00:05:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE It is. 

00:05:10
PEGGY SAX Yeah. 

00:05:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE Social construction is a relativist theory. 

00:05:15
PEGGY SAX Uh huh. Okay. 

00:05:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE It is. But, it is not rampant relativism. 

00:05:15
PEGGY SAX Okay. 

00:05:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE Okay. So, th-, and that is a, sounds like a small distinction but it's huge. So in other words, there's, as I always say, there's this very important word in the name of this orientation, I don't even like to call it a theory, which is social, the word, social. So it, rampant relativism, is I can construct the world the way I want. That's about an individual, and a psychological or mental process. 

00:05:50
PEGGY SAX Yes. 

00:05:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE Okay? More akin to maybe constructivism, some versions of constructivism, um, not all for certain. But social construction is an orientation that, where we look at difference. So there is, there are relatively, there, there are truths and realities that are relative to a particular community or set of relations within which those truths, those realities, those ways of being in the world, those preferred values and beliefs are an emergent by-product. You know, where they come from. So, um, it is relativist. So in, you know, this community, you know, might value certain forms of practice. Where this community values different forms of practice. And, if we use the criteria for assessing activity in this community, but we use it in this community, it's not really a good fit because they've constructed different ways of being. 

00:07:00
PEGGY SAX Okay. 

00:07:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE So, it is a relativist perspective, but it also is not a rampant relativism that anything goes. The challenge that we confront is how do we take these very different ways of making sense of the world, that are completely coherent and rational within either just a small relationship or a family or a community or an organization or a culture, how do we take those and not impose them on different families, different couples, different cultures, different organizations and communities? But, open a possibility for a conversation where we come to understand, or be curious about anyway, the differences and the local, what I call the local coherence, of different ways of being. 

00:07:55
PEGGY SAX So, um, I'm just following. It's fascinating following the, uh, um, the unfolding that you're describing that you became very interested in what you then coined the phrase, um, "relational responsibility". Yes? And then began from there, really to think about ethics of practice and um, a different way of thinking about responsibility. Yes? Um, within a social constructionist, uh, approach or world view, let's say. Yes? 

00:08:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah, it's interesting. I'm thinking as you say that. My thought is that my interest first was trying to respond to critiques of a perspective, you know, critiques that misunderstood the perspective or orientation of social construction. And, trying to reclaim that there was, there is, an ethical aspect. 

00:09:00
PEGGY SAX Yes. 

00:09:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE It's a truly moral and ethical and responsible orientation to the world, but it's different from a universal one. And that was my interest at first. But then, of course, it trickles down into, what does this mean for practice? 

00:09:10
PEGGY SAX Right. 

00:09:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE How do we engage as ethical practitioners? 

00:09:15
What does this mean for practice? 

00:09:20
PEGGY SAX And I know that you, "practice" to you and "relational practices" can mean many different kinds of practices. 

00:09:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yes. 

00:09:25
PEGGY SAX This particular article is about ethics in psychotherapy. But maybe before we go there, um, I'm thinking about the different ways that you also then, I'm assuming you're also saying this informs the way you go about teaching. The way you . . . What are some of the other? If we weren't talking about therapy, what else might we be talking about? How you're wanting to articulate and demonstrate that relational ethics has meaning, and that social construction is different from how it might have been misunderstood. 

00:10:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE Well, you know, it's everywhere. I mean, it's not just therapy, it's in everything we do. Okay? So there's no place that it doesn't fit, but I think for purposes of the conversation that we're having now, let's just think of any and all professional practice. 

00:10:25
PEGGY SAX Mm-hmm. 

00:10:30
SHEILA MCNAMEE So one of the things that I argue often and I see everywhere, is, and more and more so, is I'm curious about the ways in which we train people to be professionals. Okay? 

00:10:40
PEGGY SAX Mm-hmm. 

00:10:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Not just professional therapists, psychotherapists, um, but educators, consultants, managers, community leaders. Okay? We train people as if there's a recipe or a set of skills or procedures that one must adorn in order to be successful in that professional capacity. 

00:11:10
PEGGY SAX Yes. 

00:11:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE Now I wouldn't say that we don't, we can't train people. I think that there are lots of things that are interesting resources, not techniques, but resources that we can use. So it is interesting to study different approaches to psychotherapy, different approaches to education, pedagogy, different approaches to leadership. But what we should be educating, training people who are becoming, in the process of becoming, a professional to do is to integrate the resources they already have for action. The resources that they already use in their day-to-day interactions with people. So that in order to become an effective professional, you need not just to have the tools of the trade, so to speak, but you also need to have the ability to be relationally engaged with another person. And I think that's what social construction offers, is the emphasis again on, you know, the relational responsibility. Attentiveness to the process of interacting itself. If people are continually asked to look in at, what are we doing? What are we making here? That that, combined with whatever resources emerge from a particular training in a particular field, that allows people to be effective professionals. 

00:12:50
Theories as Practice, Not as Truth 

00:12:50
PEGGY SAX Yeah. You must reminded me of something that I hope I can easily find, but you talk in your paper about how, uh, selecting a theory or technique, to think of it more as a practical option, as opposed to kind of truth that you're taking on. 

00:13:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. 

00:13:15
PEGGY SAX But that it's actually, you're not, um, arguing that someone shouldn't have an approach or shouldn't have a, um, a way of honing in on a set of skills, but more not to see that as the truth. Is that, can you say a little more about that? 

00:13:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. One of the terms that I've come to hear myself say a lot, and that I like, is the idea of holding things lightly. 

00:13:40
PEGGY SAX Holding things lightly. 

00:13:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE So, you know for example, when I was doing my therapy training, we were, you know, using circular questions from the Milan Group. And so everything was a circular question. And, same with using maybe the old, structural family therapy approach. Everything was hierarchy and boundaries and so forth and that's just the way you see the world. It's not that any of those are bad or wrong. It's just none of them are the only way of looking at interaction, so that they all become possibilities. 

00:14:20
PEGGY SAX Mm-hmm. 

00:14:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE So as you sit with someone, and whatever your professional practice whether it's psychotherapy or education or anything else, is . . . For me, there's always this inner dialogue that is asking me, what seems to be resonating with this person? What are, what is a way of talking and being that is going to be generative and useful, based just on how you are responding to what I say? And if, if I'm talking with you and I make some comment about hierarchy in your family or boundaries, and you go, oh my Gosh I never thought about it that way, that's so interesting, well that's really useful. And then I'm being relationally responsible because I'm being attentive to what we're doing together rather than saying, no, you know I don't believe in those boundaries and hierarchies. That's old stuff, you know? You need to think of it this way. That would be a violent act, I think, you know, to force you into my preferred way of talking about something. 

00:15:20
Is Social Construction an "eclectic" approach? 

00:15:25
PEGGY SAX Yes. How do you think about, or do you think about that differently than how you would about eclecticism? 

00:15:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE I think so. Okay? Because I think eclecticism simply says, you know, you can use anything and everything. And there are, there is an orienting, uh, stance that I take that privileges the relational. Okay? That says first and foremost, we are relational beings. And any sense that we have of ourselves as unique individuals, or as individuals, is the by-product of our relationships. 

00:16:05
PEGGY SAX Yes. 

00:16:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE So when I'm in conversation with you now, here, there's a certain way that I can think about myself that I wouldn't think about if I were talking to my brother, for example. Because you're, you know, in this conversation we're talking about my professional work, right? 

00:16:20
PEGGY SAX Right, right. 

00:16:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE And my brother wouldn't have that conversation with me. And so, I become a specific person by virtue of a relationship. So it's that orientation of always starting from the relational and looking at what we're making together, to borrow a term from Barnett Pearce, um, that I think differentiates what I'm suggesting from eclecticism. 

00:16:45
PEGGY SAX Yeah. And, and the other piece that I'm curious about and I, is linking this then with relational responsibility, or accountability. Because I also hear you say that it's not only about being relational but you are accountable to something. What is it in that exchange that you would be accountable for if you're operating in a relationally ethical way. 

00:17:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE I think that there's not a one answer to that question. I mean, your accountable to so many different people, places, things. Okay? So, if I'm a professional sitting with a client, I'm accountable to my professional community. I am accountable to you, my client. In many ways, I'm accountable to your relations. I'm accountable to mine because if I violate something it may bring my family into some form of danger. So, I mean, it's not accountable to a thing, but it is again this idea of the multiplicity and the interconnectedness of our lives. So that's why I think, you know, when we talk about professional ethics, what's happened professionally in all professions is that that the ethical code of that profession supersedes everything else. 

00:18:15
PEGGY SAX Yes. 

00:18:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE And sometimes that ethical code violates the responsivity and the ethics that, that are happening here between people. So I might violate you, as I argue in this article, if a professional sees a family where one of the family members is a threat to other family members, the first impulse ethically is to remove the threat from the family. Now that sounds completely logical and coherent and like the right thing to do and I'm not arguing against it. But to do that, without a recognition of the huge rupture that that might create for that family, that while the threat of let's say violence, is, is, um, damaging, potentially damaging to that family, it may also be the case that the removal of that family member has an entirely different kind of threat that is equally damaging. 

00:19:25
PEGGY SAX Mm-hmm. 

00:19:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE And so it's not an either, or. I'm not, I'm not saying, oh leave the people in the family. It's not a simplistic argument. This is really complex which is why it's so hard to kind of . . . It's easier to have a set of rules and follow the rules and then you've done your ethical job as a professional. And, you know, good luck to the rest of you. You know? 

00:19:45
PEGGY SAX Yeah, right, right. 

00:19:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE So, it really is a balancing act of recognizing the ripples . . . 

00:19:50
PEGGY SAX Yes. 

00:19:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE . . . because of the relationality of all of this. That, that you're not just having an effect on one person. You are affecting yourself and multiple, multiple others as well. 

00:20:05
PEGGY SAX Yeah. I keep wanting to do this. That it both, and, just because speaking at . . . 

00:20:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE You do that well. 

00:20:10
PEGGY SAX Yes, thank you. I'm very practiced. Speaking as a, having my license as a psychologist, I'm very aware, um, of the, um, you know, uh, the responsibility that I have to demonstrate that I understand no breeches of confidentiality, um, that I cannot engage in any type of exploitation. And, and I have to be very careful and thoughtful about anything that might be seen as a dual relationship or negative effects of a dual relationship. That's the this. But then at the same time, what you're saying is there's a lot of, that that's that may be legal and important. And at the same time, there are many other considerations. And your article, opens or helps to open the space to talk about some of those other things that being legally responsible is not sufficient and sometimes it even creates dilemmas. 

00:21:15
What is a Professional? 

00:21:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE Right, yeah. You know it really does dishearten me to think that, um, in these, what I refer to as extremely intimate relationships, there is an intimacy of the good quality, not the bad quality, between a therapist and a client. There's equally an enormous intimacy between a teacher and a student, between a consultant and a client. You know, on and on. That it's so disheartening to think that that intimacy needs to be . . . You know, we have to hold ourselves back. I could tell lots and lots of stories where . . . Well, actually I will tell one story because it sort of summarizes in my life, professional life . . . As a visiting professor in Italy, excuse me in Brazil, um, every morning I walk into the seminar and every student would come and give me a huge hug and a kiss. Good morning. How are you today? How was your evening last night, etc., etc. At the end of the seminar three hours later, the same thing, hugs. Have a wonderful rest of your day. I can't wait until tomorrow, etc. I came back from that experience and I walk into the seminar room where my students that, you know, I've been away for a couple of weeks but we're sort of picking up. And there's something very unusual about this particular room, I think. And, and our students, is that they'll . . . If the room is dark, they'll come in and sit in the dark. They never turn the lights on. And the lights are always on the opposite end of the room from where I am. And I usually say, somebody please turn the lights on. This time, this one day I just thought, I can't ask them again. I say this every day when I walk in here. So I just walked down the side of the table to turn the lights on. And as I did so, I saw one of the women sitting at the table, you know her bun, walking behind her. Her tag was up. And I went to tuck it in, but I withdrew. 

00:23:35
PEGGY SAX Yeah. 

00:23:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE And then I walked back to my place at the head of the table and I said, I want to tell you something that just happened. I said, you know Joan, your tag is up. She, you know, . . . I almost tucked it in, but I didn't. I stopped myself because I'm not supposed to touch you, that would be a bad thing to do. 

00:23:55
PEGGY SAX Mm-hmm. 

00:23:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE But I want you to understand a contrast. And then I explained to them about my experience teaching in Brazil and all the hugs and the kisses. Okay? 

00:24:05
PEGGY SAX Right. 

00:24:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE Well, every student sitting around the table looked horrified, like, oh my God, she's gonna make us hug her now. 

00:24:15
PEGGY SAX Right. 

00:24:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE But of course I said, don't worry, I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna do that. I just want to point out the differences, you know, in different communities. And different cultures have different practices. We know that. 

00:24:25
PEGGY SAX Yes. 

00:24:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE But look at the effect of that, you know? A very simple thing that I could do that would mean nothing. It would just be, you know, I like you and I don't want your tag sticking up. I want it, you know, I noticed this. But I keep myself. So it is disheartening that we have to think first about, oh Gosh, will I get in trouble for doing this? Am I stepping out of bounds? Are we . . . I've had many years of teaching where I think, are we laughing too much in this room? And what will my colleagues think? 

00:24:55
PEGGY SAX Right. This is serious business. 

00:24:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE This is supposed to be serious. So, um, yeah, it's that kind of, you know, separating these things. And what I think we need to do is find a way to, um, respectfully bring them together, so that . . . 

00:25:10
PEGGY SAX The two things being? 

00:25:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE The two things being like our personal connection with people. At the same time of our professional, you know, not imposing ourselves in a way on others that, um, so that they aren't safe. 

00:25:25
PEGGY SAX Yes. 

00:25:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE So that's where professional ethics come from in the first place, to protect the clients, right? 

00:25:30
PEGGY SAX Yes. 

00:25:30
SHEILA MCNAMEE Or to protect the students, or to protect whoever. But can't we do that and also acknowledge the kind of humanness that's happening when we come together in these contexts? 

00:25:40
Beyond Abstract Theory to Lived Activities 

00:25:40
PEGGY SAX And, uh, two things, I then think about. One, just culturally both of us are in the U.S. And when I speak with people outside the U.S. they often remark on what a litigious culture we're in. And certainly as a psychotherapist, as a psychologist, that is something that I'm acutely aware of and as a teacher too, increasingly. That that's something, that's a real, um, concern, that there's law, laws behind it and you have to careful and thoughtful. And so that makes me sad in a sense but there are other ways that I've been aware of that, that there are certain things that you have to do or not do. Period, you know? And then that also brings me back to your article. When you speak a lot about why then it's important not to go abstract, but instead to go to local context. Because there's so many, there's a multiplicity of factors and there are, depending on the culture and all those factors of, within a given culture, something might have a different meaning. But with that overarching sense that we have to also pay attention . . . What are your thoughts about that? 

00:27:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah, sure. Well, I mean, you know once you have a code of ethics in place, and as in our culture many, you know, many cultures, that code of ethics is tied to a legal system. 

00:27:20
PEGGY SAX Mm-hmm. 

00:27:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE Then, it's universal. Okay? The nuance of each context can be lost in that. So, it is a, again, it's a both hand . . . Like it's not a bad thing to have a code of ethics, I am absolutely not arguing that. It's not a bad thing to have a legal system. Um, it is a bad thing to presume universality, that the same forms of practice that make sense and are helpful and useful and protective of people in one context would be the same in another. And so another illustration, you know, would be, uh, diagnosing a child as ADD or ADHD may be a very useful thing for that child, for that family, for that classroom, etc., etc. Sometimes diagnosing a child in that way is really only useful for overworked parents and overworked teachers that don't have enough support in the classroom, and support at home. So, whose benefitting? Without asking those questions, without engaging in this reflexive process, both you know what I refer to as self-reflexive process and relational reflexive process, which I borrow from John Burnham in England, you know, we just plow ahead, without doing. If we don't engage in those processes, we just plow ahead and do things because that's the way it's done. And my common statement always is, if I ask you, why did you do that? And you say, because that's the way it's done, or that's the way it's always done, or because they told me too, that that's a really bad answer. It's a really bad answer because it means you haven't been engaged in that reflexive process. So the self-reflexive process, you know, every time I think, this is what should be done. Or, here's what I should do, or here's what you should do, etc. I always, this inner dialogue says, well, what else could it possibly be? Am I so certain it's, that's what's the best thing to do here, etc.? And the relationally reflexive process would be to say, is this working for you? 

00:29:45
PEGGY SAX Right. 

00:29:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Or, what we're doing here, is this, is this sensible? Is this useful? Are there questions you were hoping I'd ask you that I'm not asking you? Are there conversations we should be having that we aren't having? 

00:29:55
PEGGY SAX Mm-hmm. 

00:29:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE So, to check in on the process itself with those with whom you're engaged. 

00:30:00
PEGGY SAX And also to check in on the content too, is what I think I'm hearing you say. Is that if you use that example of diagnosis of ADD say, or of whatever it might be, that, um, how would you bring that knowledge or that possibility, uh, to negotiate that it might be helpful in one context and not to another? Um, I guess that's a question. Do you have any thoughts about that? 

00:30:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE How would you? 

00:30:25
PEGGY SAX Yeah, how? 

00:30:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE I think simply to know to not be . . . That's another illustration of, you know, if I say I'm a psychotherapist and my job is to diagnose the people who come to me and without questioning and just presume that any person who comes to see me, by definition comes to see me because they have a problem, and that that problem is diagnosable. And so that's just the track. That would be a problem. But to recognize, I'm a professional. People come see me. Sometimes the best reason to give a diagnosis is because the person can have their insurance pay for the services, okay? So if you can open up that conversation and we know, both of us know many people who do. You say things like, I need to do this because you're insurance won't pay for this unless I do it. What do you think? Here are three sort of, you know, diagnoses that you could choose among that kind of fit. Which one would you like? Other people come see a professional, don't want the professional to be a professional. So then, you know, the professional should step in, in that way. 

00:31:40
PEGGY SAX Right. And presumably there might be someone who is a diagnostician and that's they what they do and someone would come to see them because that's what they want. Right? 

00:31:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. 

00:31:55
