DANIEL SIEGEL Ah, my name is Dan Siegel and I'm really, really excited to be here with you to spend this next three hours together talking about mindfulness, mindsight, ah, and the mind in general. Where gonna be diving into questions that really build on fundamental questions for our field in psychotherapy which is, if we are therapists of the psyche, and a synonym for psyche is the mind, then we are therapists of the mind, and it's a good idea to explore then what is the mind. Ah, some of you may have heard Professor Edelman speak this morning about the mind and the brain, and that was really a, a wonderful, uhm, opportunity to dive into certain scientific aspects. And we're really deeply going into this question for our field in psychotherapy. So, let's start, ah, question to all of you. How many of you are psychotherapist? Raise your hand, please. Wow, fantastic! Okay. And how many of you actually thought you are here for an intro to Disneyland? Okay. So, then let me address your concerns and about Disneyland. There's-- so, uhm, for you and your formal training as a psychotherapist, how many of you had even one lecture that defined what the mind is? Please raise your hand. So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16-- raise them very high-- 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. Okay. Very good. Who's good at math? What's 35 add of-- they tell me there's 2,000 people in the room-- what's 35 out of 2,000? Not much, right? Now, that's actually an average number more or less. I've asked over a 100,000 mental health professionals the same question and it's is about two to 5% in every field of psychotherapy have been given a definition of what the mind is. So, we can say now that of a sample group of over a 100,000 and now-- and 2,000 or we just leave it at the 100,000 where we count every single person. Uhm, 95% or more of us have never been given a definition of what it is we're doing. Because if we're therapists of the mind and no one tells us what the mind is, how can we do a therapy of it? And, of course, the second issue is, if you don't have a definition of the mind and we're not alone in psychotherapy and the field of mental health. Cuz it turns out-- I've asked 17,500 teachers, K-12 and it's the same number of about 2% have been given a definition what the mind is. But if you ask a teacher what he or she is doing, they say, "I'm trying to help the mind of my student learn, grow, become compassionate," whatever it is, and then you ask them what the mind is and, you know, way over 95% have never heard anything offered to them. It turns out-- and I wish we have a panel of people here so you could actually see it without me just being the person you have to rely on for the data-- but I've asked chair people of the departments of psychiatry, psychology, sociology, anthropology, and even philosophy including the philosophy of mind, and I was shocked to find that none of those fields have a definition of the mind. It's really odd. Now, of course, we know what we mean by mind. We mean your feelings and your thoughts, and the thing that gives you subjective experience. We know what we mean by that but we don't have a definition of it which is really interesting. So, when I talked to philosophers who write books with mind in the title, and I say, "You know, I love your book but I noticed you-- have no definition of the word you used in the title, mind." And they will say, "Well, you should never have a definition of the mind." I said, "But why?" They said, "Because if you define something, it limits you in your understanding of it." Okay. So, ah, so I say to them, "Well, you know, I'm not a philosopher," ah, which I'm not. I'm trained as a scientist but I work as therapist, so I'm a psychotherapist, the therapist of the mind. So if a client comes to me, well, if a client comes to me and says, "Ah, Dan, listen, uhm, I'm coming to you because you're a psychotherapist." I said, "Wonderful. thank you for being here." And he said, "What you're gonna help me with cuz you're the therapist of my psyche which, of course in a dictionary means what? A soul. Right. The spirit, the intellect, and the mind. Those are the four synonyms for psyche. Uhm, you will help me with my mind. What's my mind? And if I said, "Well, no one ever told me, I'm not sure what it is. Ah, I don't think that would fly, or at least, I don't feel comfortable with that." So I said to the philosopher I can really respect the idea that when you put a word to something, right away a word linguistics limits our understanding. So, in this presentation and in our discussion, we need to be really careful that we're gonna use words to communicate to each other. But whatever the word is representing, you can be sure that you can always make the statement, well, that's more complicated than that. Right? Cuz everything is more complicated than a word. A word is a symbol that symb-- you know, is a map of something. And it'll be like, if we're gonna go to Yosemite Park. And you have a map and you got to the Yosemite. And you're searching all the beautiful complexity of Yosemite, but you brought out your map, you said, "You know, Vernal Falls does not look like this picture. That can't be the real thing. This is the map." So, we're gonna use maps to talk to each other. But maps are really helpful because if you wanted to go from Anaheim to Yosemite, it will be useful to have a map. So, we're going to explore that right now. So, what I'm gonna start out with is this fundamental issue not just in our own field in psychotherapy but also in the whole field of mental health in general, and then in the fields that study and work with the mind like professional fields like education, ah, or even contemplation. That, you know, meditation practices. Uhm, or the academic fields. No one is defining this term. So, what happened to me years ago was, ah,-- and, and I'll just say this really briefly cuz I wanna get to the clinical application of all this stuff-- uhm, I thought if I brought a bunch of scientists together, ah, maybe we could get at the heart of this issue. And so, in 1991, the beginning of the decade of the brain, about 40 scientists together, and this is where I first learned that none of the fields have a definition of the mind. All those fields I just mentioned were in the room including physicists and biologists of all sort. Now, in neuroscience there is a definition which I'll just to lay out straight, you will hear a common statement made by neuroscientists and, uhm, Professor Edelman urges us not to be scientism is, not, ah, had this overly reductionistic view of science. So, this comes from that. But a, a basic view now that's held even by many people in the field of psychology and psychiatry is that the mind is what the brain does. And a, a, a, a textbook of psychology even written by one of the leaders of, uhm, the field of social neuroscience, uhm, says that the, the mind is brain activity that relates to feelings, thoughts, and behavior. So, I just wanna put that out there that, you know, there are statements like that, that are made and they may be totally true. Uhm, I, I think they're partially true. These are really, really bright thoughtful caring people who say to them. But I'm gonna urge you to consider that there's a reason to keep an open mind, whatever that is, ah, about, about this question. So, on the one hand, we have a very common statement that I could be up here and just say, "Well, the mind is brain activity. Let's get into the brain, and we're gonna get into the brain. But the brain is part of story." So, one thing we know that's the mind just to make the descriptions really clear, is something that is so important in psychotherapy and so important in life and we just named it and it's called "subjective experience." Subjective experience is defined as the lived texture, ah, that you sense, moments and moments in life. It's an inner felt sense that, you know, you can never really let someone else know about. I mean, poets try, and musicians try, and songwriters try, and you know, people who write novels try, and we try in our relationships, we always trying to bring the inside-out. Uhm, but the fact is, the very nature of subjective experience is that it is inside you. And even if you and I were going for a walk and we saw like a big, red sign and you said to me, "You know, look at that red sign," we would have no idea if the red I experienced is the red you experienced. Even if we have one of those Likert scale things, you know, saying kind of or a lot, or really a lot, or not much, and we put a little rhyme there so we weren't just giving their number, you would never know even you and I put a line in the exact same place. And we have 20 different versions of red and we say, "We're seeing the same red. Look. We did the Likert," it still doesn't tell us at all that you inner experience of sensing red is the same as mine. And it's really an interesting thing. Now, why a subjective experience is important? Subjective experience is important for psychotherapy because in all the science, the measurable things we can study and the ways we can methodically review science of relationships, and one in particular and this is reviewing a beautiful work of John Norcross in all the meta-analysis of the different forms of psychotherapy, what is one of the most important aspects of a psychotherapeutic relationship across every school of therapy that Norcross has studied? It's empathy. It's the tuning in of the therapist on the subjective experience of the client. And just to give you an example from my field, I'm a physician in medicine, you know, you can do a study where you take a person who's a physician and you have them say an empathic comment in a certain situation and you have them not to say the empathic comment in another situation, and you have, ah, people come to them for a common cold for a 10-minute doctor visit. When the doctor makes an empathic comment such as, "Wow. You're a student now, aren't you?" "Yes, yes." "Oh, well, this is finals time. It must be really hard to have a cold while you're studying for finals." That's it. How long that it take? Twenty seconds? Versus another person comes in. No empathic comments are made, same prescriptions are made, same statements. "Oh, I think you have a common cold. Okay. So, just go drink fruits and get lots of sleep and rest and do an exercise, or whatever for a couple of days." Same statements are made. The person who got the very brief empathic comment got over their cold a day sooner and their immune system which was measured was functioning better. Isn't that amazing? Ten-minute doctor visit. What's also amazing is when I was in medical school, I never saw doctors do that kind of thing and that's why I dropped out of school. Uhm, which I did. Uhm, and then years later, they had me go back to the same school and give a, ah, a, a-- an address and opening kindred address to this big convention about medicine to say why emotions and emotional communication was so important in medicine. It was an amazing moment. So we're learning a lot. So, the first thing to say in terms of our description of the mind, it has that-- it has subjective experience and a ton of studies across the board a and attachment research in psychotherapy, in clinical encounters like medicine show-- and you probably know this intuitively, that relationships that focus on the subjective experience of each person in a relationship ha-- are relationships that thrive. And I'm an attachment researcher. I studied how parents and kids interact and that's the simplest way of, you know, same what secure attachment is based on. It's when you have a parent is crazy about you and tunes in to your internal world, who sees the mind in terms of subjective experience beneath behavior. It's so often now parents are so busy they focused on behavior and scheduling and worrying about, you know, what high school their kids are gonna get in to and worry about what college they get into, and then worried about graveyard they're gonna be buried and all like kind of stuff. You know, it's like there anything but tuning into internal experience in the meaning of something. Okay, so the first thing we're saying is that this specialty we have called psychotherapy is very unique because it's dealing with subjective experience. So, the parent that are common-- I think we all need to just take a time or moment to pause and think about is that subjective experience is not synonymous with neurons firing. It may depend on neurons firing, it may arise from neurons firing, but it's not the same as neurons firing. Neurons firing means you have these long cells called neurons and you have ions going in and out of the membrane called an action potential. And it's like a charge going down a spatial route down the neuron, and at the end it releases a chemical. And the chemical flows across the synapse. And the synapse has receptors, and the receptors are like locks and the neurotransmitter is like a key. And some of them are inhibitory, some of them are excitatory. They make it more likely or less likely the downstream neuron called the postsynaptic neuron will fire. That's all great. It's fascinating. It's so interesting. In since there are 100 billion neurons in the brain with an average of 10,000 connections of a single neuron to other neurons, the number of on/off firing patterns in the brain is calculated to be 10 times 10 of million times. The number of possible firing patterns in your head is a number that is larger than the atoms in the known universe. I didn't say neurons or their connections, the number of possibilities of combinations of firing. That's how wonderful your brain is. We're not putting down the brain. But even if it turns out which I'm not sure it will, but even if it does turn out this subjective experience depends on neuron firing. It doesn't mean of the same thing. That's really, really, really important to say. I was once given a lecture to retired professors and, ah,-- at UCLA and, and a retired professor got really mad that I said these things I just said. And he said, "You're reversing science because we know the mind is just brain firing." And that phrase just brain firing actually is bio illogical to say that because you see the way we're defining the mind has having this one element of subjective experience. You may think, well, that's pretty obvious but actually in science as Dr. Edelman said earlier, over a 100 years ago, subjective experience was abandoned by scientists studying the mind because they couldn't measure it and there weren't to be scientific dis-- be scientific, you have to observe something to measure it. So, we have to understand our field in psychotherapy, you know, is dealing with an entity that has really befuddled science for over a century. This is a really important point to all of us to take a deep breath about it and think about it. Because in this talk, we're gonna talk about looking at it scientifically but we need to know that for a 100 years, it hasn't been. Okay, so that's the first thing. Subjective experience. The most important part of relationships is the subjective experience people have. So if you just said, "Why do I need to know about the mind?" As a psychotherapist, the first thing to say is, first of all, it's in the title of your job, so that's probably good. And now, as we pull it apart, uhm, the subjective experience thing is not just like, oh, you're being kind of a sensitive person. No. The science of relationship shows that people who have their subjective experience are tune to by others do better in life. And you saw it just in the 10-minute doctor visit. Imagine if your spouse was tuned in to your internal life is you can imagine that. Ah, you know, imagine what that would be like and how your immune system would function better. So, then you can ask the question before we get into the next element of consciousness, but you-- for what we're staying with subjective experience. You could say, "Well, hold on. Why is subjective experience the most important part of a relationship between two people like in psychotherapy or in romance, or parent-childhood relationship, or teacher-student relationship, any relationship actually? Why is that the case?" So, you can say, "Well, at a very deep, deep level of existence-- and we're gonna get to this in a little bit-- your very sense of being real and being authentic and being alive depends on the capacity of yourself in relationship to you, so there is a relationship we have at ourselves where you're honor in your own subjective experience-- and we're gonna talk about that very soon-- and other people honoring your subjective experience. So, you can have a way, for example, you may see this in your clients where people say, "I don't think I can feel sad. In fact, I don't feel sad. And they're crying, but I don't feel sad." Any of you who have patients like that, clients? Right. There you see the relationship with one zone subjective experience is that you have notions of how things should be but you're not should think open to how things are. That creates a huge problem for the individuals intra-relationship. We have many parts of ourselves and that's an example where your relationship with yourself is in trouble because you are not honoring the subjective experiences of another person. So, within ourselves, we have intrapersonal attunement. Just to use that phrase "intrapersonal", within the self attunement. We have interpersonal attunement. What are these forms of attunement do? At a-- at experiential level, they allow you to feel real, feel alive, feel seen. As one of my patients said in the first year of my training and, ah, I was being, uhm, supervised by a bunch of people in different schools of therapy and I never understood anything they were saying actually, so I never did anything they said to do cuz I didn't understand it. It wasn't like I was trained to be rebellious adolescent which maybe I was, but I just didn't get it. So, I just let the patient kind of teach me what needed to happen. And she was a graduate student. She was finishing her post-- ah, her doctorate and her going on and onto a post after-work and she got better amazingly cuz I don't know I do-- what I was doing. Uhm, and so I said to her at the end when she was ready to go and she was done with therapy I said, "You know, in this program, uhm, we have this, uhm, exit interviews." Yeah. We have exit interviews where we talk about you know, what was effective and what happened in the therapy. She said, "Well, that's a great idea. We'll do that in the next session." She came in the next session. She wasn't even thinking about it. "It's really, really simple and really obvious how you help me." And I'm going, "Oh, god! Right." My supervisor now is gonna tell me what I did with not even a video to think she was the recipient of it. I said, "Yes, yes. Uhm, so how, how did you experience it?" And she goes, "I felt, felt by you and I've never had that before in my life." And we sat there in this beautiful silence. And I wish I could quote her name. I can see her right now. I have a gift she gave me of this. I guess I guess I can say what the gift is cuz I never know who she is. Anyway, she made this symbolic art-- piece of art that represented our work together which was this kind of integrated piece of pottery. It's still in my office. And, uhm, and that idea of feeling felt and the, the work we worked on with different aspects of yourself respecting each other and working together within her, how I had to be this growing young therapist finding a way to be real with her, and seeing-- letting the therapy finds its own way, it kinda revealed this amazing thing which is that there was a fundamental process that I didn't understand how to make sensible to talk about. It's just very soon of linking differentiated parts of herself of me and her. And ultimately, when you honor the subjective experience of yourself, you're letting things be differentiated. So I have to think I should be this way but I'm not. I actually feel sad but I don't wanna feel sad how do I hold those two at the same time with an awareness. So, feeling felt is the simplest way that I can think of from this beautiful patient, a beautiful person to say the fundamental aspect of what happens in therapy. Now, why is it healing? It's healing because often in life, an attachment or if you have some genetic predisposition to have your mind which will describe soon not functioning well, you are not in the state of authentic being. And in many ways, you know, what emerges in that feeling felt experience is fundamental kindness. You know, kindness-- you can define I, I think the-- these ideas work together this way. Kindness is recognizing, honoring, supporting one another's vulnerability. These tender places. And the tender places only come out when you're allowing your subjective experience to be what it is, not to be messed by all sorts of expectations and judgments. So, in this first part of our looking at the mind, when we say it's subjective experience, it places our work as psychotherapist in an unbelievably important frame when it comes to thinking about this scientifically. You and the incredibly hard work that you do are bringing into this very chaotic world, chaotic internally, chaotic interpersonally, chaotic globally. We live in a fragmented overwhelming, flooding, and sadly, deteriorating time. And for a human being to maintain some kind of sense of hopefulness and optimism, some kind of feeling of being whole and full and feeling like they can be with themselves is a huge challenge. And therapists, whatever your school thought are really working with people. And whatever they come to therapy for with this as the fundamental ground that we work in. So we're trying to define the mind here. We're starting the subjective experience and saying, "You are on the whole planet the experts in subjective experience." And what is that mean? It's a feeling of an emotion. It's a texture of a thought. It's a sense of a memory. All right. It's the beliefs we have. The perceptions we hold. The intentions that go through us. The meanings embedded in our narratives. These are all the ways you explore subjective experience. I tried to remember it in teacher to parents with this simple acronym. Most of you know me a little bit that I'm acronym addict so be careful. Here's the first one. SIFT. So, if you have to say, how do I really help my clients tune in to the subjective world, you're helping them sift the mind, S-I-F-T. Checking with sensations. That's the lived felt experience of the body. Have them be opened to images. This is beyond word-based thoughts. Images can be visual, they can be sound, they can be all sorts of forms, so let imagery arise in you often without a sense of control, ethos feelings which relates to this thing called emotions which interestingly have no definition, and we'll get into that. And thoughts. And you know, we have this-- we have a three-year online program that people take. And one of the-- those of you who were my online students, you know this but who aren't, you know, we have this, ah, set of funny exercises we do. One of them that you do for a week is to think about this following question. What is a thought? And then after a week goes by, we have this online discussion about it. And what fascinating about it is no one in the planet has a definition of what a thought is. But we always have thought. We know what a thought is, but we don't know how to define it. Cuz you can say what's you're-- you're thinking in words, no, it's information. It's not all you can do all sorts of things. So, thoughts are the T of SIFT. So, the, the beginning of what we have to recognize in our work in psychotherapy is that there is no other place in the professional world that basically starts with saying subjective experience is number one. And that's because the only place that subjective experience exists is in things related to the mind. So, this now raises a connotation of minds. Sometimes people hear me cuz I've written books with almost all the books I've written have the word mind in the title like Developing Mind or Mindful Brain or Mindsighter or whatever. I, in no way, I'm using mind as intellect versus emotion as heart. So, I would never say a phrase mind and heart. They make note that in, in a way, I'm using the word mind, it make zero sense because the heart, the body as you'll see is a fundamental part of mind. So, not talking about mind as intellect or cognition or rational thinking or something that. Not at all. This is a deep sense of mind in subjective experience. The second part of mind before we get into a, a clear definition of a-- another aspect of mind is consciousness. Now consciousness is a really, really, really interesting thing because you may get a feeling for the idea that these are fundamental things we all take for granted. But it's important to know that consciousness, uhm, for us in therapy is exactly what we use. So, you know, I, I don't offer a form of therapy. Ah, I'm not like-- m-- many of the speakers you'll hear at the conference who, who have a particular approach to therapy and, and, and they, they do what is fantastic. You can then study it. I come from a field called interpersonal neurobiology. And what we do in neurobiolgy is we basically take all the disciplines of science and we weave them together. So, physics and mathematics, chemistry and biology, psychiatry and psychology, sociology and anthropology, and everything in between, and we say, "What if you had one framework?" So, interpersonal neurobiology is the work that, that we do and it's different from a field you may have heard of called "social neuroscience." Social neuroscience is a name that was actually invented later and it means that in biology you have a branch of biology called neurobiology or neuroscience, and within neuroscience you have cognitive neuroscience, affective neuroscience, and now, social neuroscience. So, interpersonal neurobiology sounds like social neuroscience. They're completely different. Interpersonal neurobiology is what's called the consilient approach. Consilience is an old English term that E. O. Wilson wrote a whole book about which is basic when you find universal findings across independent disciplines. So we take a consilient approach and we weave together mathematics, physics, chemistry, etcetera, on and on, so that we can look at culture and we have got the cortex. We can look at synapses and we look at society. We can go back and forth because we see human life as be emanating from all those levels of the same reality and in interpersonal neurobiology. Then, what we say is that you can look at the science but then apply the science. So we say that we bring science to life. We're trying to take all the sciences and find ways to improve human life. That's what we do. So with interpersonal neurobiology started in the '90s, it was really an intellectual effort. Since I was a clinician, I tried to apply it in practice. And then, we now have three dozen textbooks that I've overseen the publication of 36 textbooks in interpersonal neurobiology that other people have written or I've written a few of them. And so, we now have a library for the field of mental health. So, you say, "Well, I wanna read more," there's 36 books waiting for you. Uhm, and that's through the Norton publisher. Ah, so when I'm about to talk to you about consciousness is really related to the interpersonal neurobiology view. So, from a neuroscience point of view, people are always looking for the, uhm, ah, NCC. You may have heard NCC is a, a term in neuroscience that are used for the "Neural Correlates of Consciousness" and it's the big holy grail for neuroscience to figure out what in the world is happening to the brain and others are quote "to create consciousness." And I put quotes around it because we've talked about subjective experience not being the same as neuron firing, and now we're coming to consciousness. Now, consciousness can be defined very simply as the sense of knowing. So right now as you're listening to me speak, if you're conscious and not sleeping, you have a sense of knowing that I'm talking and, and you're listening, we're interacting with each other, and that's a knowing. Consciousness has this subjective quality of knowing. It's just a sense of knowing. It also has the known. So I can say the word, "hi" and in your consciousness you may think I'm saying hello or you may think I'm thinking about getting intoxicated, or you may think about, you know, going up to the top of the Matterhorn and they'll be too high for you or something. Your-- you can go with the different aspects of the known, right? So why is consciousness important? In, in interpersonal neurobiology view, we're not a form of therapy but we inform therapy and we get inform by therapy cuz we're looking at any discipline approach to understanding being human. Uhm, so what I did was I just checked out the different research-proven effective forms of therapy then I looked into the popular forms of therapy that maybe just as effective but they just didn't get a research arm to what they were doing. It doesn't mean they're less effective which is not something necessary that an insurance company would pay for. Uhm, and then I look based on the any form of therapy that anyone was claiming worked even once they weren't popular. And what I noticed was one common element. One common element which is fascinating because they're all warring with each other and saying one is better than the other and stuff like that. And, ah, even though interpersonal neurobiology, uhm, has this kind of stance in science, you know, we participated in practical applications so it's always limiting because people say, "Give us the manualized approach, the IPNB, the Interpersonal Neurobiology." We said, "There is none. It's not a form of therapy." In informs anything you do, whatever form of therapy you do but it-- so that limit us of course to being insurance covered or you know, we don't certified people in doing this kind of therapy cuz we're a form of therapy, we're a way of knowing. And it applies the psychotherapy as much as education and parenting and policy formation, contemplation, religious studies. We have a lot of our-- you know, we have a lot of departments to what we do. So in, in this view then, every form of psychotherapy have one thing in common. They all use consciousness. They all require that a person is aware. So we're going to use the term consciousness and awareness are synonyms that you have a sense of knowing that something is happening. Now, there are different kinds of consciousness, ah, but they, they share in common the sense of knowing. Now, why would that be important? Well, one thing is as important cuz I think for the most part, psychotherapists have brilliant ways of sitting with clients and figure out and help them. So, if you say that every form of therapy is-- I can't find an exception, if you know one let me know cuz I'd love the-- it's always great to get exceptions cuz then you can have a better discussion, like, "Oh, these 25 doing this, 10 don't." But I haven't found an exception why would every form of therapy use consciousness? It's a good question. But one thing we could say is that when you get out of our field and go to the field of teaching, what you find is that every form of education even though there's different schools of thought of education involved consciousness too. So you can say that learning depends on consciousness which is really interesting. Now, this fundamental notion that being aware of sense of knowing and the known produces the potential-- not always-- but the potential for change clearly should be something that we as psychotherapists interesting in helping people change, ah, will be interested in. So, what do we know about consciousness? From the neural correlates point of view, we know that there are many, many, many different theories and none of them really agree with each other. They're, uhm, necessary incompatible but they, they look at it in very different ways. What's one example? One example you heard from Professor Edelman which is a beautiful, beautiful example of something called "re-entry" that when the firing patterns in the brain get reinforced enough, that's what re-entry. It's basically neurons firing, create subsequent firing that comes back and reinforces the neurons that are firing, that there's something very unique about the brain's activity during conscious states where there is a huge increase in the linkage of differentiated components at that moment, that usually involved aspects of the thalamus and aspects of the cortex. So there's a thalamocortical. Thalamo means thal-- thalamus. It's a deep part of the brain that, uhm,-- but since we started talking about the brain while we're talking about consciousness, the evolution of psychotherapy, uhm, organizers were so kind. Cuz you can see, I don't have any PowerPoint slides and people often get frustrated they don't have any handout. They were so kind to supply you with the model of the brain that they've taped under your chair. So if you reach under your chair-- go ahead-- reach under your chair, reach under your chair and you'll probably find it there. If you pull out your arm, you'll find attached to your arm is a hand. And this is a model of the brain we're gonna let you take home with you. And you can have-- and my daughter says don't ever say that it's a handy model of the brain. But it is. Okay. But one last one, it's your handout. So, if, if you take your hand model of the brain and you, you put your thumb in the middle like that and put your fingers over the top, and then this would be positioned in your head like this. It's an actually unbelievably accurate model of the brain. It really is so useful. I was just up and see Edel yesterday teaching and, ah, someone gave me this unbelievably beautiful note from the principal of a school where this-- and she's let me say this publicly so I know I, I have permission to do this, this young boy, his mother was incarcerated, put in jail, and he was-- having to go live with some other relatives and was missing his mom and he was really acting out in the new kindergarten he was in. And the teacher has been trained in this mindsight techniques that I'll be teaching today and so she taught him the hand model of the brain which you're gonna learn right now. And he listened and she talked about flipping your lid which we'll talk about soon. Uhm, he was able to listen, listen, listen, took it in, said, "I need a break cuz I'm about to flip my lid." He went under a table, came back and he went like this to her and went "I'm ready to be back with the class." And it really empowered him. It really empowered him. And what I learned a long time ago when I read a book of Parenting From The Inside Out with Mary Hartzell, uhm, was that when you teach people, kids, adolescents-- there's a new book, Brainstorm is all about teaching adolescents about their own brain-- uhm, I'll be talking about that later this wee. In parenting, you know, we, we do this in the whole brainchild. When you teach parents about how the brain functions like you're gonna learn now, it's amazing. People can say, "Look. It's not my fault but it is my responsibility."This is a crucial thing that a mom said to me once in this preschool we were teaching at. "You taught me about flipping my lid. I realized it's not my fault. My brain did it. But you know something, it's my mind's responsibility to get my brain to act in a better way." And this is the beauty of actually having this vision of the brain. It's not the same as the mind but we now know and I know when I used to say it, people will roll their eyes and just kind of laugh at what I was saying. We now know the mind can change the function and structure of the brain. What's nice to say that in the '90s, people would say, "I'm a goofball." And they may have been right but it wouldn't have been in that reason. Uhm, we now know from clear science in the last 14 years as the Developing Mind first came out, uhm, that the mind can change the function and structure of the brain. When you know the structure of the brain, you can change how it works. Just like metabolism. When you understand that eating high glycemic foods needs a change in insulin and the way you get hungry faster and then you eat high ca-- high carbohydrate foods, and then you get this all sorts of changes. It's your body doing it but you can use your mind to change what your body functions by altering what you eat. The same thing is true with the brain. You can change the way the brain functions, and function then changes structure, and what's the food of the brain, it's energy and information flow we'll get to in the next-- the third part. But in consciousness, what I wanna say here is that when this young boy in kindergarten was given this hand model of the brain, he could place into consciousness the idea of choice so he can make change. So, we're gonna go into the brain because when you have consciousness of things like knowledge, you can have a choice and make a change which is what he did. He's the same kid that was acting out before, but now he had information. Information is transformative. You could say, well, he also had the teacher attuning to him. Absolutely. He had a feeling of feeling felt. That was there too. No question. Okay. So, let's go through the brain. But let me just check with you because I see a lot of people's bodies getting-- moving around getting ootsy(ph). Uhm, I have something called the tension excess disorder, uhm, which means I could stand here for about 12 hours and just chat with you about this stuff. Uhm, I'm, I am in touch with my body but my bladder just says, "This is really interesting. Let's keep on going." Uhm, so I know it's a three-hour segment. I usually do this without a break. Are you guys okay not to take your break or you're gonna need a break? 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN No break. 

00:42:30
DANIEL SIEGEL No break. Okay. Cool. That's great. I just wanna make sure I'm not imposing my problem on you. Okay. Thank you. All right, so let's go through the parts of the brain. The reason to do this as psychotherapists, one, it's kinda interesting but you're not here just be-- to be interested in things. It's unbelievably useful. I would say every single one of the people I see, I called them patients. You may call them clients. The, the people we work with that are really our companions on the journey of change. You know, these, these companions we have, when they have knowledge, the knowledge is empowering. So we're not saying even though we'll now go through the details of the brain that the brain and mind are synonym. They're not the same thing. But you can use your mind to change your brain. In many ways, you could say that every client that come to see you is coming cuz their brain is running the show, not their mind. And if that's the case, we know now with scientific certitude that you in your relationship with your client can get them to be inspired to rewire their brains. That's a fact. And I feel so excited to be here with you in our field of mental health to say that. This is an unbelievably fantastic time to be in the field of mental health. Not because we're reducing the mind to the brain, just the opposite. We are showing the mind is not the same as the brain. And if it were, then we would have nothing to do with psychotherapists. So what I'm gonna show you is elements of the brain. Because when you know the parts of it, and this is just a pre- cursor so you can bother to, ah, think about why this might be important to know about. When we get to the third aspect of mind cuz we're talking about subjective experience, consciousness, and we're going to the third aspect, we're gonna look at a process called integration. It's just like a teaser. Integration is the linkage of differentiated parts. Integration from an interpersonal neurobiology point of view is health. So we're not only gonna offered definition of the mind in the third part, we're gonna actually offer a definition of a healthy mind. So integration is the linkage of differentiated parts. If you don't know how to differentiate aspects of the brain, it's gonna be hard to know how to link them so you're actually gonna be lost conceptually. You may be doing all the same things but conceptually, you want of a framework that pulls everything together. And it turns our amazingly that integration happens not just inside your body. Certainly, it doesn't happen just in your skull, it's happening throughout the body. But it doesn't just happening in the body, it happens between people. So, integration in a relationship is what feeling felt is all about. Honoring differences, promoting compassionate linkages is integration interpersonal style. And when we get to this third part, you'll see that the sus-- the, the substance of mind is not limited to the body. It's not limited to the skull. It's within us and it's between us. And when you realize that-- and you take this fundamental prin-- principle of integration, then you understand that integrated relationships which we'll go in huge tale soon, stimulate the activation and growth of the integrative fibers of the brain. And that's why we're gonna do the hand model of the brain because you wanna know how do I link differentiated parts of this brain. So, whether you're doing this form of therapy or that form of therapy or this form of therapy, I have the great honor in this moment of my life to be invited to do the keynote addresses that many of the different forms of therapy that are represented here. And people take me to dinner and they say, "Well, interpersonal neurobiology explains why this form of therapy also that one." And I said, "That's beautiful. It's wonderful." It's the same talk basically. Integration explains for me every form of research-proven therapy that exist. So, it doesn't take away from the beauty and the rigor and the discipline they had to do the double-blind controlled studies. That's fantastic work. Really important. But it shouldn't be so shocking that wonderful beautiful people have dedicated their eyes to this thing and then they badmouth the other group which they do, but they're doing the same thing only through a different window of opportunity. So, because I can be friends with each of them, they do the badmouthing to me about the others who are also my friends. It feels bad. Uhm, but I say, "Look. I understand the proprietary issues, you know, that you're losing money cuz that other one got money and all the stuff. But when it comes down to us as therapists, the issue is really finding the commonalities." And for us to take John Norcross's work to heart that the key to what works in therapy, it was-- what works across all schools of therapy. And that's integration. You doesn't use that word. But that's what I wanna suggest it is. Empathy is an example of interpersonal integration. And integration as you'll see in the brain right now is the basis of something that you may have heard about called self-regulation. The way this brain-- I'm, I'm doing all these cuz a lot of people say, "I don't wanna know the details of the brain." The reason we wanna know the details is because self-regulation which means how do you regulate your attention? How do you regulate your emotion or ethic? How do you regulate your thought? How do you regulate your behavior? How do you regulate your interpersonal relatedness? Okay. Those are five form of regulation which are the source of basically every form of psychopathology. Psychiatric problems are-- well, well, people come to us with-- comes from dysregulation of attention, emotion, thinking, behavior, and relatedness. Those are all that can be subsumed. Remember the term self-regulation? Some people called it executive function. Obviously, there are other issues but that's basically is the heart of what we do. And here's what I'm gonna tell you. Every form of regulation, every form-- and when I revised the Developing Mind, I had 15 interns working with me to take the statements in the '99 book before we came out with the 2012 revision-- ah, it's not revision, but it is the second edition. And I said to these interns, I said, "I want you to take those ideas in the Developing Mind and let's prove they're wrong because, you know, 12 years have gone by and there's probably lots of sciences, etcetera that were kinda interesting ideas but they're wrong and let's write a new book. That will me more interesting to do and then just revise an old one. So, let's have fun, prove everything I said was wrong." And they go, "What?" I said, "Yeah. I want you to prove it's wrong. That's your job. Prove what in the first edition was wrong." I divided the 15 of them to teams. We, we put the digital book up on the wall. We went through every sense with over 2,000 scientific studies and about 98% of the hypothesis I wanna say proven but they were supported by subsequent research. For example, the proposal to DS-- ah, in the, uhm, the first edition which has upheld is if you take a look at the DSM, you'll find that every disorder is an example of symptoms of a syndrome that fall either into the category of chaos or rigidity. Chaos or rigidity. Now, that's an interesting pattern when you find a whole book and a whole field suggestion. They don't say that. But that's looking at what they've described and their vocabularies and defin-- and descriptions. So, then you say, "Well, is there any science that says why some pattern of a system should fall into chaos or rigidity?" It turns out there is. It's called the mathematics of complex systems which basically tells you this is what we're gonna do next but I want, I want to know why you're about to know the brain. The systems that linked differentiated areas to each other move in harmony. And when systems don't link differentiated areas to each other, they go to either chaos or rigidity which blew my interns away. So the suggestion in '99 book is all psychiatric disorders are disorders of integration. How was to be explained that chaos or rigidity is what emerges? The technology didn't exist but the proposal was when we look into the brain, you're gonna see that integration is impaired. Was that mean either differentiations impaired or linkages impaired or both? Okay. And people said that kinda goofy. But whatever. So, what the interns found was huge support from University of Washington in St. Louis, the work of Marcus Raichle shows that in schizophrenia impaired integration of the brain. Bipolar disorder, impaired integration of the brain. Autism, impaired integration of the brain. And what Martin Teicher show at Harvard University? When tho-- those I just stated, autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, those are not due to experience. We don't know what causes them. Maybe genetic, maybe infectious, we don't know. But not from our parents due. What about experiential causative disorder? Abuse and neglect, post-traumatic states, impaired integration in the brain that we'll review right now. So whether it's experientially derived or non-experientially derived, psychiatric disorders in our view are impairments integration. One of the ways that manifest is when we get to our hand model that these regions that are differentiated are either not differentiated or not as an autism or not link enough as in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. And the result is rigidity or chaos, or both. That make sense? So, what we have is this really foundational model of interpersonal neurobiology which basically says we're gonna define the mind in part three. We're gonna say what a healthy mind which is a mind that promotes integration within you and between you. And now we're going to the within part so we can see what happens in the brain. And whatever lettered form of therapy you do, uhm, it's likely gonna be promoting integration. Now, the people who run those may not agree. That's fine. But when you do the studies of outcome, so far in all the brain studies of outcome of psychotherapy, the brain becomes more integrated. There isn't an exception than I know that effective therapy that reduces symptoms of chaos or rigidity moves a person toward harmony. So, it's not really that hard to say. Well, if that's what integration creates, that's probably what's being created. That's where it comes from. Okay. So, let's do our hand model. Let me just see before we get into this, are there any conceptual questions you have because we're gonna get into the brain now. I don't wanna get lost in brain details. But if there is a question, come on up to the microphone. I wanna address just from the conceptual point. If not, the third part is gonna be where get the fundamental definition of the mind based on everything we talked about that I think gives you a framework for understanding how I approach therapy. Any, any conceptual questions? Okay. Great. So, uhm,-- yeah, please come up to the mic so everyone can hear your question. 

00:54:25
UNKNOWN Can you please elaborate a little bit about rigidity? 

00:54:25
DANIEL SIEGEL Yeah. Can I elaborate on rigidity? And I will be very, uhm, unrigid when I elaborate on next session. Yes. Okay. So, let's take the hand model. Before we get into the details, I wanna start with a very important philosophical place for all of us therapists because it is really, really easy to see a brain scan and feel overwhelmed, it's really easy to hear the great things they say and feel like they know more than you do and you feel about yourself, seriously, and it's a very, very important to know that every science has its vocabulary and its approach. And I'll, I'll touch on a little bit about that, that but you have your own gift and your own specialty and you have a huge amount to offer in this world. And you are dealing with part of human experience, that's probably the most important part, but it's not touchable by science. Subjective experience and consciousness, they're trying to get out of it now but it's really hard. But that's your specialty so you should walk with pride. And just cuz you don't speak Greek doesn't mean that the language you do speak is less. I just wanna say that. It's really, really important. The first... 

00:55:50
[sil.] 

00:55:55
DANIEL SIEGEL The, the first thing they say that's really cool-- i-- ah, I love biology, the study of life. And one of the interesting thing is to sift within your own mental life, your subjective experience, and by the way, you may not have noticed this but just some to think about it, can you have a subjective experience without consciousness? And are these first, first two things really-- one subjective experience is just the texture of what you feel when you're conscious. And that's a really interesting question. So, maybe that number one. And number two, subjective and some consciousness are actually overlapping. I just put that out there because it's a really interesting question. Uhm, phenomenal abjectly, it is how things unfold. Can you have subjective experience without consciousness? And of course, most of what happens in the mind and in the brain too is not in consciousness. But why would we call that subjective experience if it's not a felt texture of something? So, we're not saying everything is conscious. Most-- the vast majority of things are going on are not conscious. Okay. I had a holiday party the other day for Mindsight Institute and afterwards, uhm, the CEO came to me and said-- she said, uhm, "Why did you emphasize this at the institute?" something I emphasized when we're kind of working on that. And I said, "That's a really good question." And I had to do a lot of soul-searching and I came up with a non-conscious thing that I felt really ambivalent about, that I was kind of seeking their help to work through. And she said, "You know, why don't you work that on your own time?" Which is totally good. I mean, and sometimes when you're speaking spontaneously at a party and you're having fun, you know, yes you know, things can comes out that you don't really intend to come out. Okay. Anyway, so most things are not conscious. And notice I'm using the word "non-conscious" cuz I'm trying to say things are not in consciousness so it's non-conscious. I don't use the word non-conscious because for it made an incredibly important contributions, but from a scientific point of view, uhm, some of those have not held up and people then fight about the word unconscious. So, to avoid that, I just say non-conscious. Just the simpler thing to do. Okay. The first thing to say is that, and I hope I'm not shocking anybody in the room, but when life begins, there's an egg and a sperm. And they have half the genetic complement that ultimately the human being will have and they get together and they form a conceptus which is a one-celled organism in the womb and then it divides into two cells, four, eight, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, etcetera, until finally there's a very special moment in life that happens in this growing the-- young being where there are cells that are different from each other. Because now they've been identical up to now. Now, there's some on the outside and some on the inside. So, that's the first moment of differentiation and yet, all of biologies about differentiation and linkage. Okay, so that's the first thing. For our point of view of getting into the hand model of the brain, what happens is if you, if you-- this isn't the hand model, but if you just either-- well, you can do this with your own hands, make a-- like ours-- a little ball with your finger tips touching each other like and the heel of your, uhm, palms touching each other like that, this is what the, the ball would look like the ball of cells. Now move your, your, uhm, nails inward so your knuckles began to kiss each other and then do it so your second knuckles meet. And notice where your fingernails are now. Did you see that? That's the origin of what's called the "neural tube". Now, let's back that up. Put it in reverse and do it again. So, what I'm saying is there's an outer layer of cells versus the inner layer ca-- and the outer layer is called "ectoderm", the fetal skin cells. And some of those skin cells are gonna move inward and become your entire nervous system. Now, the reason I bother to say that is, the skin is all about the interface of the inside world and the outside world. It's the, it's the thing that allows us to interact with the outside world, right? The skin. Neurons are fancy skin cells and they have the same commitment to interacting and int-- integrating the inner and the outer. And I say that because while we're gonna get into the brain, you're gonna see that when we're talking about the mind, there even brain function. It's about linking the outside world and the outside. So, as you as a therapist say, "Okay, now I'm diving into the brain. Oh, it feels a little too technical." Always remember this fundamental principle that you're looking at the organ of the body like the skin that's gonna interface the inner life and the outer life. Okay. Now let's come back to our hand model. So, you put your thumb in the middle, put the finger on the top, we're gonna name the major areas of the brain. Now, of course, there are 100 billion neurons in the skull and case part of the, the, ah, nervous system. So, that neural tube is gonna extend in sense of neurons out to the distal end which is the head and then they're gonna grow and expand, and that's what we're gonna look at right now which is the head part of the nervous system. People called the brain but we now know there's also a brain around your heart and there's a brain around your intestines. So, I used the general term for brain for the whole nervous system. In fact, I kinda use it for the whole body and people say, "Why don't you just use the word body?" And I'll give you a little confession, is that when you're from California and you're pushing things like the mind as not syno-- synonymous for the brain or, you know, relationships shake the brain. You better be really rigorous in your scientific statements. So, if I started saying body, they'd roll their eyes and say, "Oh, you're from California. You're a body person." But it's really the embodied brain. It's the embodied brain. And my daughter says, "Don't say that." When s-- when she was a teenager and I say, "Why? I shouldn't say that," she goes, "It's redundant, Dad." And I said, "What do you mean redundant?" She goes, "Have you ever seen a brain that's not in a body?" So, she's right but it just gets us both good things. So, it's an embodied brain. Okay. But we're gonna look at the head part of this brain thing. All right. So, the spinal cord, the neural tube is representing your wrist. And even though there are 100 billion neurons, we're gonna reduce it to three major areas. If you lift up your fingers and lift up your thumb, the first area in the skull we're g0onna talk about is in your palm and this is the brainstem, and sometimes spelled as two words, sometimes spelled as one. Brainstem. It's the deepest part of the brain so some people called the "old reptilian brain". It develops first in utero and it also evolve long, long for over 300 million years old. The two really important things in therapists to know about, about the brainstem are that they, ah, have-- there are cells and there are nec-- neurons that are clustered together that help regulate, ah, physiology like your heart rate and your breathing and determine whether you're awake or sleep or not. There are also areas in the brainstem that are very important for creating reactive state for threat which you probably familiar with fight flight but actually there are four reactive state. Fight, first F, flight, second F, freeze, where you tighten up your muscles, third F, and the fourth F is faint. Faint. And we have an entire book devoted to that in our series Interpersonal Neurobiology Steven Porges, the Polyvagal Theory. Fight, flight, freeze, and faint. Anyway, let's do a little, uhm, experiential here so you can kind of feel it while we talk about the brainstem. This is gonna be an opportunity for you to monitor your brainstem state. So, if you put your stuff down, ah, and what I'm gonna do is invite you to have the subjective experience that whatever arises, come into awareness or consciousness. So, we're actually be exploring those two things. And now as we segway to the third thing, you just let yourself just feel whatever you feel, experience whatever you experience, and we'll go through this. I'm gonna say a word, repeat it several times. I'm gonna pause. I'm gonna say another word, repeat it several times and I'm gonna pause. And then we'll do a couple a lot of things and then we'll see how that is. Okay. If you want-- if you're like me, I like to close my eyes so I can really can just feel my body, but if you wanna keep your eyes open, do whatever you want.

DANIEL SIEGEL Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. 

01:05:40
[sil.] 

01:05:45
DANIEL SIEGEL Now you can take a nice deep breath. And just to add more element to this exercise, try putting one hand on your chest and one hand on your abdomen and put some gentle pressure and see how that feels. 

01:06:10
[sil.] 

01:06:15
DANIEL SIEGEL Now try to switch it out with the hand that's on the abdomen that goes to chest. The chest hand goes to the abdomen. Put some gentle pressure. See how that feels? 

01:06:30
[sil.] 

01:06:35
DANIEL SIEGEL And then switch it to every way felt most comfortable for you. Comfort in. 

01:06:40
[sil.] 

01:06:45
DANIEL SIEGEL Okay, very good. And you can leave your hand there if you want. We're gonna-- you can open your eyes if they're shut and let's just do a quick, ah, assessment just-- so I can get some, ah, impressions here. How many of you felt that putting your hand in your chest and a hand in the belly actually feel comfort in? Raise your hand. Really high, really, really high. Okay, great. Almost everybody. And how many of you, uhm, felt like, well, it felt good. Both of them felt about the same. Raise your hands if left and right on top are the same. Raise your hand really high. Okay, that's great. And how many of you have felt that left on top was the most comforting? Left on top. Raise your hand really high. Okay, great. And how many of you felt right on top was really comforting? So interesting. Okay. Good. Now, is there anyone interested getting a PhD? Okay, good. So maybe you can work collaboratively. Here's a PhD worth getting. I've done this now to I think over 15,000 people. It's always about the same. It's about 95% or more feel one is better than the other. Uhm, 2% or so feel it's a-- it's about equal. And it's usually about a quarter or left on top an three-quarters are right on top. And when I've had smaller groups and we can interview everybody left-handedness, right-handedness, it doesn't correlate with that. So, I've done one study for those who are gonna get the PhD in this where I went to-- do you know the HeartMath people? So, I went to the HeartMath people. They allowed me to have a research sleep over. What, what geeks do for fun as like a summer camp. So, so I went there and I, I, I took their machines which you can actually get and I, I put it on my earlobe and I was measuring what is called "heart rate variability coherence" which is a measure of integration in the brain really. It's a measure of integration of the autonomic nervous system. And I'm a left on top guy. And when I did my right on top, it did nothing to change my coherence which is a sign of integration. And when I switch it to my left on top, I got-- I became profoundly coherent and it have the subjective experience then maybe you felt a clarity of calm, of ease, comfort of safety. It-- didn't-- have you felt that? Raise your hand if you felt that. Yeah. So then, that was one PhD you can get. Why are some people after one people right? The only reasonable thing I've ever heard was it's your political innings. Uhm, so that will be one PhD. Here is the second PhD. So, Rollin comes in if I'm playing with the machines and I said, "Rollin, you know, let me put this on you." So he put the thing on himself and he's you know, as hard as doing what I was doing. I said, "Rollin, can I tou-- put my hand on your chest?" He goes, "What?" I said, "Can I just do this? This is just an experiment. I'm just kinda curious." He goes, "Okay." "What are you doing?" He had no idea. So I put my right hand on Rollin's chest. No change. Take my hand off. I put my left hand as, as far as I can tell exactly the same place, exactly the same pressure, he'd became totally coherent. Second PhD. The practical implication of this for you and for your patients, your clients is that we should teach people the self-soothing integrative body movement. It cost nothing and does everything. Why not teach it to them? And those of you who're gonna get your PhD, when we do EVO in four years, come back and tell us the result please. I will give you enough time to get your degree. I'm telling you it's a perfect, ah, research thing because you have ability in control. You have a research come in and they are their own control group. You just have them to do this and this. I've asked every neuroscientist I can why is this they come with all sorts of things that don't make any sense because they say, "This is why the left on top will be good." I said, "Yeah, but three-quarters are right on top." They go, "Well, this is why the right will be good." It was like-- okay. Well, you can't have it both ways. So no one knows it will be really, really interesting to see. Okay. Now, let's just do a quick sampling. When I said no one yes, how many of you felt that subjective experience with an awareness was different when I said no versus yes. Raise your hand. Okay. So, let's draw out some words just to scream them out wouldn't you know to feel like. I'll pass my hand across. Yeah, it's my word. Angry.

UNKNOWN Accepting. 

01:11:30
DANIEL SIEGEL Accepting. Okay. All right. Now, the, the first thing to say is I'm not your Dad telling you, you can't have ice cream. So what's interesting about this is it's just a guy up here on stage saying a word with non-verbal aspects of tone of voice. Ah, people always say, "Why don't you say like no really nicely and say yes really meanly like you did?" And that will be a way to drive people nuts if you're on your tunes. It would be this troop test of reactivity in the brainstem. But the issue I wanna bring up is that if we come back to our hand model of the brain and this is good always do the subjective experience and consciousness with talking about the concepts because what we do in the online program is, you know, we spend a year introducing the concepts, a year going over the clinical training in it and then a year means there are-- cuz all accord in our 32 hours, so I have somebody to do it like in three weeks the whole 96 hours cuz they are really en-- enthusiastic. But here, the first year introduction, the second year clinical work, you know, how do you assess people, how you do the treatment impita-- implementations stuff like that treatment planning. But the third year, because we got this information out there is ho-- teaching you how to be a teacher of interpersonal neurobiology. So what I'm telling you here is something that comes up in the t hird year which is, you know, you always you wanna give your students in a-- and this is with your clients too, an opportunity to both have knowledge and have first person subjective experience and weave them together that deepens learning, that deepens learning. So, this is kind of what we're doing here. We're taking a break cuz you're about to go in a bunch of Greek terms which is fine. So the first take home message that the brain has two fundamental states and everyone in therapy should learn these states. Everyone in schools should learn these states. In the Brainstorm book where I'm-- that I wrote for adolescents and their parents. The parents should know this and the kids should know this so the people can get along better. The two states are these, reactive and receptive. Reactive and receptive. There are very different circuitries involved. Reactive can go to fight so some people felt the anger and empowered. They wanna fight back. So if you do this, keep up your feet between you and other person. Literally, I do this as an assessment tool during our evaluation especially of kids are dysregulated and they will jump off and attack me, or if I'm having the mother or father say no, they will literally attack someone when they no and that's one of the hallmarks of early bipolar disorder. For example, at dysregulation, they cannot hear no. They totally flip out. Uhm, okay, so, so there's fight, there's flee which is just active running away or the feeling of wanting to running away. There's the freeze which is an activated tightening of the muscles. And when I wrote the book, the Pocket Guide to Interpersonal Neurobiology, I gotten in tuck-- touch with Pat Ogden. It does sensory motor work. And also Steve Porges who's a scientist studying the Polyvagal Theory. And I have these e-- emails back and forth. I said, you know, people are really asking us to clarify what the science is saying cuz the-- people always talking about fight, flight or they're talking about fight, flight, freeze. But it's much more complicated that-- can we come up with the-- a more accurate for our therapy callings to teach their clients about how the brain actually works. So, the four-- the three of us came up with this four-part thing that you'll see in the Pocket Guide which is this kind of non-linear book that kinda let you weave these ideas together in your own way. So, it's fight, flight, freeze and the faint is the dorsal branch of the 10th cranial nerve, the vagus nerve which decreases heart rate and decreases blood pressure. And to think about that combo, when you drop your heart rate and you drop your blood pressure, you collapse. This is a state of reactivity that can be activated. When you feel totally helpless, it's not activated in everybody but especially in, in those of us who are prone to disassociation, you can activate this dorsal branch. And I was in a therapy session myself and working with my therapists about some very, ah, painful, painful experience I had. And I was completely helpless. And I said to her, I said, uhm, "I think I'm gonna faint right now." And I said, "I didn't lie down or you're gonna resuscitate me." And she goes, "Oh, you're having a dorsal dive." And that what it is. It's, it's, it's the-- and I-- she said in lovely way it's, it's a-- uhm, it's the dorsal branch, the unmyelinated dorsal branch of the vagus nerve so that's why it's called the dorsal dive cuz it's the dorsal branch, the vagus nerve. You also, I guess fall on your back. I guess that the reason is dorsal. So but-- anyway, so we can all go there in a different time but that's the reactive state. When you're working with a couple and people on the reactive state, they can't engage properly in empathic communication. You're coming from a fight, flight, freeze, or faint state. You can't. So, wanna teach your clients, you know, individually or in couples or in groups or in families or whatever set you're working in. You want them to be aware of what's going on inside of them so they shift it. And you just learn one basic technique of shifting from reactivity--- receptivities with your hands. There's also some technique of focusing on the breath that we'll do later on. We'll do a big thing, uhm, later in the week, the Wheel of Awareness which helps all these things happen all in one practice. Okay, so that's the brainstem. It has this nuclei. Now, if you put your thumb over the top-- and let me just ask you, is this too much detail or it is okay? 

01:17:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:17:05
DANIEL SIEGEL That's good. Cuz I-- you know, I love science and like by a talk like this, my family, with my kids there, they all get up and start doing the dishes which my wife likes but I feel lonely. You know, so, so I just wanna make sure I'm not like dumping my obsession of the details with you. So if I start saying too much details say, "That's enough, Dan. Move on." cuz I can go on and on within me. Okay. So, the next part of the brain we're looking at is a, a part that's next both-- in anatomy, it's higher ups, it's the limbic area, the thumb area. You'd have two thumbs, be a perfect model left and right. And this limbic area also is next in the sense that it evolved 200 million years ago. So, right in a 300 million year-old brainstem, it is a 200 million year-old limbic area. The-- so therefore, it's called "the old mammalian brain" because it, it evolved as we became mammals. There are five really important functions relevant in psychotherapy that are-- and I'm gonna use the term and it was a little bit of a science issue mediated by or created by or this part is responsible for, or if you had a tumor there or an injury there somehow it would hurt the, the outcome of these functions. So, we, we don't wanna be simplified because the fact is the brain is working as a whole system so would never ask-- you'll never say how-- you wouldn't say where does that happen in the brain. That's not actually the way we talk anymore. It's more how does it happens in the brain. We're not localizing. That-- that's a view that was about 15 years ago held and held for a 100 years. We now understand that it's more about how are the systems working together. So the limbic areas gonna coordinate a bunch of thing and allow these things to happen. But there are five things that it is mediating responsible for etcetera, etcetera, uhm, and it's very important into how, how these things happen. Let's name the five and then review each in term. So, the first is, uhm, emotion. The next is motivation, and I'll go through this into great detail. The third is appraisal. The next one is memory. And the fifth one is attachment. And don't worry if you deal with that cuz we're gonna go through them. Let's go number one. Emotion. In our series, the Interpersonal Neurobiology Norton Series, uhm, we have the honor of asking scientists to try to translate their work for us in therapy. Cuz if you ever read science-- I mean, I'll be honest with you, it's not only overwhelming, but it's kinda boring. Ah, usually, we're going to therapy cuz we like human interactions, we like people, we like the uncertainty of things, and a scientific paper is not like that. So, we go to the scientists and say, you know, "We want you to translate your science for clinical application." And one of the many beautiful books we have that does that is Jaak Panksepp's book with Lucy Biven are called The Archaelogy of mind. And in this book, you'll see a deep, deep clinically relevant discussion of the science of how the limbic area works with the braistem and body to create our emotions. So there's huge amount of detail in there and, uhm, when, when I was asked to write the foreword for that book-- when I wrote the foreword, you know, I wanted, ah,-- in all the forewords I write, I try to really distill the incredible wisdom these folks offer us. So, what's the wisdom here? The wisdom is that-- and this is controversial like anything in science-- that the origin of emotion is either primary feelings we have. They just washed over us, or categorical ones like sadness and anger, and disgust, and surprise, and joy, and all that-- and all these basic ones that Darwin described. Either way, whether the primary or categorical, they arise from the body, your muscles and bones, your endocrines system, your organs, your intestines, your heart sending signals upward. And for those you who wanna know, through the vagus nerve, the 10th cranial nerve, and lamina one, layer one of the spinal cord, you know, do you remember that stuff? Those who wanna know it now you do. It comes upward, goes to the brainstem and goes to limbic area. And that is believed to be the source of emotion. It then rises up. It's gonna hit the third part of the brain, the cortex, we'll talk about it next, but the source of emotion from this subcortical view-- and I say subcortical is the third area as the cortex. Sub means below. So, subcortical just means basically in the brain, the limbic here in the brainstem but it also would mean the body, anything literally below. Okay, so emotion. Now, emotion, in many ways, doesn't really have a definition. When you read the scientists who study emotion, there's no accepted share definition of emotion. So, we'll get to that later on. But, but emotion is really important in what we do in therapy. You know what it is. It's a big feeling that you have that can be quiet but still important or huge. It could be not conscious or conscious. So emotion and conscious is not the same. But because it involves the limbic area, the brainstem, and the body to invite your clients to know what they're feeling. The F of SIFT means asking them to focus their attention, and attention is that process which streams energy and information asking them to focus their attention on the lower experiences limbic sensations that arrives. Like, what the amygdala doing is house the limbic area anger, fear, that kind of thing. Uhm, but to go down into the brainstem, your reactive states to go down into the body, my heart is pounding, huh-huh-huh-huh. My lungs are doing like that. Oh, I got this feeling in my intestines. My muscles are tight. I'm trembling. All of that, I'm perspiring. All of those bodily reactions for-- if you have a client who doesn't know what they feel, that's okay. You're gonna build the circuitry of streaming energy and information from the body up through the vagus nerve and lamina one, up into an area called the insula which is dominant in the right side at the right side of the cortex which is gonna house aspects of the brain that mediate awareness is gonna feel that first. Emotions are on both sides of the brain but there's this more direct impact on the right cortex we believe. That's very controversial, but we'll leave it there for now. Test number one, emotion. Number two, motivation. The limbic area works very closely with the brainstem to motivate us. So, in the Brainstorm book that I'll talk about, ah, on the weekend, uhm, in trying to translate all the stuff for an adolescent to read or their terrified parents to read. You know, I'm-- I'd say, "Look. The brain has to change in these particular areas, uhm, in order to get that the adolescent ready to leave home because you gotta be motivated differently. So, in people have the myth that adolescents are lazy and bored, it's just to think the world we put them in are not conti-- not connected to their actual shifting motivation. So, we need to understand what that is so we can empower these adolescents to bring out their courage and creativity that they're filled with. I'll talk about that later. But if you would look at these change in the limbic areas relationship with the brainstem in adolescents. So, motivation. Number three is a very important process related to both motivation and emotion. These are all interconnected functions. It's called appraisal. This is basically the way the limbic area filters either what's coming from the outside world or what's coming from the inside world like dreams or perceptions or thoughts or anything, and it gives meaning to them. And the meaning that it give has a set of layers. The first layer if the limbic area could speak of the something like, "Hey, is this happening worth paying attention to you? Should I devote energy to it by focusing my attention on it?" So, of course, when appraisal shifts for an adolescen-- a, a, a middle school teacher has driven mad because they're not paying attention to what he or she is saying. Because they're actually not having the same kind of appraisal system that they have when they were in fourth grade. And teachers don't realize that. You can understand that's doesn't change how you teach. Okay, so appraisal is that. That-- so you're paying attention. Once you pay attention and you're orienting as yourself to it, you then say, "Is thing good or bad?" So, you, you actually orient attention before you're assessing if it's good or bad, you then quickly to know good or bad. And if it's good, I want more of it. If it's bad, I want less of it. And, of course, for an adolescent that changes anything for a client in therapy. If their appraisal system is saying, "You know, something I don't wanna talk about is trauma." They're gonna drive their attention away from that and you're gonna have it in an artful way, give them the space to feel like when they're with you, they maybe able to do something that they can't do without you. So you're gonna be literally aligning with their limbic area appraisal whether it's worth paying attention to signals in their body that reflect their trauma. For example, dreams or reactions, or experiences during sexual encounters, or relationships they have with other people or relationships with you. And all of that is that appraisal system that's shaped absolutely by trauma. So, that's the limbic area. That's number three. Numbe four in limbic area is memory. And the memory area is that a really important of mediate. A bunch of different functions are the hippocampus, is here in the limbic area called the medial temporal lobe as well as the amygdala. And, and to put it very, ah, in very simple terms, the hippocampus distinguishes between two kinds of memory by integrating a fundamental kind of memory into a more elaborated kind of memory. And they have names. The fundamental way we encode experience into neural connections, store them, and then retrieve them is called implicit memory. So implicit memory is distributed throughout the brain but it includes the amygdala which processes emotional memory. The hippocampus which develops parts of itself by an 18 months of age starts developing what's called explicit memory. And explicit memory has the unique feeling to it that when you take it not only from encoding and storage, but when you get it to retrieval it has a feeling of I am remembering something. And explicit memory is two parts. Explicit memory can be factual, dominant on the left side of the brain and episodic meaning remembering yourself at an episode on the right side of the brain. And how the hippocampus integrates implicit memory into its explicit forms I believe is blocked in trauma. That's a proposal I made in the early '90s. And the idea there is that you can stop the hippocampus from functioning either by flooding it with cortisol or by dividing attention. Cuz you only put one channel at a time through consciousness. The hippocampus requires consciousness for its processing which is a clue to why every form of therapy I believe uses consciousness. Consciousness activates the hippocamopus to take the basic building blocks of memory which are the following in explicit memory. It's emotional memory, perceptual memory, probably bodily memory though it's not really studied, motor memory which is called procedural memory, and also the generalizations of those forms of memory into what we called mental models or schema, and then something called priming which is getting your brain ready when you're activated by a cue. Implicit memory when it's in its purer on integrated form when it's not processed by the hippocampus. Here's the number one important thing about memory for every therapist to know about. Implicit memory, in it's purer form whether it's emotional memory or perceptual memory, or procedural memory, or bodily memory, or mental models or priming of six elements, when it's activated, it is in consciousness but it is not associated with the feeling of I am now remembering something. So, it's a memory but it doesn't have the subjective feeling of remembering. Unbelievably important research finding from the '80s, that for some reason people don't' know about. Now, when you think about this, when you have a trauma and you either divide attention cuz you don't really wanna be focusing on what, ah, an attacker is doing to your body and I focused on some beautiful flowers on a mural on the wall, and you're attacking my body. And then, two days later, all I remember explicitly cuz I'm having consciousness are the flowers on the wall. But then 10 years later, something happens and with my girlfriend in the shower or something. It's like the rain that was on the, the roof of some place where I was attacked. Now I entered this flashback. So a flashback is can't be thought of as an implicit activation that hasn't been processed by the hippocampus. That make sense? And then the treatment approach based on this view of memory is to use your relationship with your client to create a sense of safety to alter the feeling in the brain with a dual focus of attention where the person is aware "I am with you, my therapist, right now." And I'm also focusing attention on my implicit memory. When the implicit memory arises, if I'm not also-- either in some kind of a fluid way aware of my connection with you as my therapist, I'll just be re-traumatized. So, it's very important if this dual focused of attention. And then EMDR, you would do bilateral stuff. In schema therapy, you do something else. In narrative therapy, you do something else. But, ultimately, they are all, I believe doing the same thing. You are harnessing the part of the hippocampus to couple with, with consciousness within the safety of an attachment relationship then that allows a representation of implicit memory that was blocked because the hippocampus was either blocked because of cortisol secretion or blocked because of divided attention. And by the way, when you increase adrenalin, it enhances the implicit encoding whereas cortisol inhibits explicit encoding. So this combination of the, the adrenalin and cortisol of a trauma does exactly what we see in PTSD. So, when you understand this then when you're with your client, now you have a frame for, "Okay, this is likely what happen so I need to use my relationship to create a receptive state rather than the reactive state that just reinforces the trauma, let those activations come forward so the person is gonna learn two things. They're gonna learn something new and they're gonna unlearn something old. And people are taking about re-consolidation theory but whatever techniques you wanna use, these two things are how memory works. Unlearn the old, learn the new. You do that with consciousness by harnessing the power of the hippocampus because explicit memory allows these memory configurations to become more fluid and flexible. Is that make sense? So what you, what you have then as a therapist is an understanding when a person is being flooded by emotions or flooded by bodily sensations or flo-- flooded by images or flooded by behavior impulses. You understand that it's very possible. These are unintegrated literally on integrated implicit elements of the past overwhelming event we called trauma and now you're gonna help them work it though. And so that the brain will change because you'll be integrating neural firing patterns that before were unintegrated. Okay. Uhm, if there are points of clarification-- but-- so there's a lot to say. This is you can see why we can do days and days on just, just that one topic. The, the fifth aspect of limbic function-- remember, we're just reviewing the brain now, right-- the fifth aspect of limbic functioning is attachment. When we became mammals, we have this situation different from the fish that I raised, of the frogs that I raised at home, amphibians and the fish, they're-- don't have a limbic area. But for those of us, mammals with limbic areas, here's what happens. You're not only have hair and warm blood but you have attachment relationships. What an attachment relationship? Our young depend on us for care. So, when my fish lay eggs, I've gotta make sure those fish don't see the fly when they get out cuz they'll eat them. Cuz they're in a little aquarium. So, we as mammals, take care of our young. And, we, humans have a very interesting way that we've used attachments that Sarah Hrdy, H-R-D-Y, talks about beautifully in her book, Mothers and Others, we have collaborative caregiving. It's never been the case in our human species until recently in modern culture that a mother was intended to be the soul caregiver for an infant. Never. And our, our, our species development, at least for the last 100,000 years has been collaborative caregiving. Now, that has a huge impact on our evolution. It's meant that we have to figure out who can we trust and not trust to raise our babies. It means that we can actually have differentiated roles in our village. That means that we need to communicated with each other and collaborate with each other. We are a collaborative species. But in modern times we emphasize isolation and competition instead of interconnection and collaboration. It's sick. What has happened to us? I'm serious. And so, we need to wake up to this issue. I spent a week with Sarah Hrdy and other scientists, you know, thinking about what is the actual story than science really tells instead of what modern culture tells us we are. And, and I talk about this in the, uhm, in the Brainstorm book because we have to-- now we work on ourselves as adults. We have to take this next generation especially the adolescent generation coming forward and empower them with the truth about our collaborative nature. And the-- there is an urgency to what as you know, ah, about the, the dire situation on our planet which I think in many ways is due to this false belief that were separate. So, the, the reason we just put all that with the limbic thing in the brain and not on the brain is that it is in fact, in our nature to be collaborative and it's in our nature to be relational. Okay. If you bend your, ah, fingers over the top, you now have the third part of the brain we're talking about which is the cortex. The cortex was elaborated in our mammalian history so people called it the "neomammalian cortex" or "neocortex", or just "cortex," or "cerebral cortex" as are all synonyms. Cortex means outer part so it's the outer layer of the brain. Ah, and if you had to say it in a natural what the neocortex does is it makes maps. It's-- and most of it, it's six neurons deep in these cortical columns and we believe that somehow the neural firing in these columns that are imaginated over and over again. Those are the folds of cerebral cortex which are actually very thin. The neocortex is actually-- if you lay it out flat, it's as thin as six business cards laying on top of each other. That's how thin it is, super thin. But it's all folded over so it looks big and, and I get to the certain kind of complexity and inter-- interconnectedness. Now, here's the deal about the maps. If I move my hands like this and you see them with your eyes, we know that the back of the brain is gonna be firing. So, we say that your experience of vision is map in the back of the brain. But that's a little simplistic because if we put you in a, in a house in blindfold in a week, we know that your fingertips-- the signal from your fingertips will take over the back of your brain. Because your mind will need to go to find the bathroom and find the food. And the only way you could find that would be the map out the three dimensional world with your fingertips so your brain would accommodate. The thing to say about that then as the back of the brain instead of going to visual cortex, it's the 3D cortex. And so, when blind individuals use Braille, they're using that same area of the brain because it's mapping the three-dimensional world. Okay. Then there's the sound world. That's the side of the brain. Then, there's the world of what you do with your body. That's the upper side, the parietal lobe. And then, there's the-- from your last knuckle forward, there's the mapping out of a much more intricate part of the brain, ah, which is basically our conceptual world of ideas, making plans, having a map of who you are, who I am, who we are, map across time. And this is the frontal lobe. And for us in therapy-- and I was really intrigued to hear Professor Edelman, ah, affirm this. He said that, uhm, probably the most important part of the brain and the head that we deal within psychotherapy is the prefrontal cortex. And, and I would actually agree with that, a-huh, in ways that we're gonna talk about as an integrated structure. It's not that it itself is doing anything particularly unique. It's just it is coordinating and balancing the whole system. So, let's take a look at that. If you look at your second to the last knuckles forward, that would be your frontal lobe. If you look at your last knuckles down to your fingernails, that's the prefrontal cortex. And there are many parts to it and I'm just gonna name them. But if you don't like Greek terms, close your ears but for those who-- you do, then it's important for you to know. There's no reason if you know these names. I'm saying them just-- cuz I often get-- people run saying, "Why didn't you give us the Greek terms?" And other people say, "He gave us too many Greek terms." So, I'm-- you know, how to make everybody happy, so close your ears if you don't wanna hear. So the side fingernail area will be the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex which is very important for a lot of things but especially for paying attention so people point to it as trouble in attention deficit. If you go toward the middle, the midline structures, ah, include the dorsal side of the medial prefrontal cortex. So, it's a dorsal medial prefrontral cortex. Then, when you go further down in the midline this way, the medial prefrontal cortex, it's the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. And then just below that, although some people put them together is the orbital frontal cortex. And that just behind the medial, both the dorsal and the ventro side of the medial and the orbital frontal, that is the answer singular. Now, once you've gone midline this way, this is also a midline this way, back and forth. Ah, that's horizontally. And to the side there, just like we have the dorsolateral way up on the side, on the top. There's the ventrolateral. The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex some people say and some people don't and some-- which scientists really say how's the insula. And there's a-- there's an anterior insula and a posterior insula. Don't worry about that. But when you-- once you get all that together, you go backward a little bit, inward in the brain. There's a part that some people put in the limbic area but most people these days are put in the prefrontal cortex is the anterior cingulate and it's related area, the posterior cingulate which is further back so people don't include that. But the cingulate gyrus-- forget all that. Let's just called prefrontal. Uhm, they work all together as a team. So, when you hear Dr. Edelman say, "Well, the prefrontal cortex," he could mean dorsolateral, he could mean ventrolateral, he could mean the, the, the medial, he could mean the orbital frontal, he could mean the anterior so you get-- and he probably means all that stuff. So let's take a look in your hand model and see why are people so interested in the prefrontal cortex and we won't put a modifier on that. We'll just gonna call it prefrontal. So, why are people interested in the prefrontal cortex. So, take a look at your model and I'll gonna do a little anatomy dissection, so if you get queasy, feel free to lie down if you have your dorsal dive going on. So, open up your prefrontal cortex a little bit and put it back down. And what do you notice is unique about the anatomical location of the prefrontal cortex. It touches everything exactly. So let's take a look at it. It's linking directly one synapse shopping to the cortex of which it's apart. If you will lift up your hand model of it, you'll notice it has direct links to limbic area, sitting on top of limbic area, it receives direct input from the brainstem. And we haven't said it yet, so you now had a memory. The, the-- when I gave this similar lecture in Australia, ah, I know instances of it. Uhm, when I gave this same le-- thing in Australia, th, the hotel caught on fire just as this very same part of the lecture. So, we all had to leave the hotel and it was on fire. It wasn't a drill. And, uhm, so we went to this park and I just got up to this tree and I started giving the rest of the seminar up a tree. So, there was a media person there and they put it in the newspaper and it said, "Dan Siegel down under up a tree." Okay. So, now I'm just recovering from that implicit little activation there. My heart was going bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, but then I was in a tree and it was kinda peaceful. So, all right. There's nothing wrong with an implicit memory. I just wanna have some explicit understanding of it. Okay. So, uhm,-- what are we talking about? So, yes, the prefrontal cortex. So, we've got input from the cortex, the limbic area, the brainstem, the body itself. Remember we said that there are these inputs from the, the, ah, vagus nerve, the 10th cranial nerve, those are synonyms, and the input that comes up layer one, lamina one of the spinal cord come up to the insula, uhm, and they register themselves then in this fascinating communication just apparent that had a comment. I am so fascinated with this following finding. When you look at the details of the prefrontal cortex and see the way the insula especially in the right side of the brain, in it's anterior not posterior part. But the anterior insula communicates with the anterior cigulate. And the only way it does that within the prefrontal cortex iself is through these neurons called "neural stem cells" which have this fancy name called "von Economo-- that's a person's name-- von Economo neurons. But the neural spent-- spindle cells. Anyway, the thing about in there that is so cool, the spindle cells, is they're very white bore which means they communicate action potential superfast. What's especially fascinating about that is when babies develop self-recognition in a certain way, we put a dot on them and they see in the mirror that dot shouldn't be there. That's the age or on 14 to 18 months, they develop von Economo neurons, but they don't have it earlier. But then when you look at elephants, orangutans, and porpoises, they're the only other mammals that have the von Economo neurons and they also respond to a dot you place on their body and show in the mirror and they freak out. Anyway, I think it's interesting. I'll bet you that when we get fine tune technology in the next five years, you're gonna find that people with eating disorders have trouble with their von Economo neurons and you'll find that in general in psychotherapy, the more you teach self-awareness and a sense of self-regulation, the more densely populated the von Economo neurons will be between the anterior cingulate and the anterior insula. You watch. That's a guess. Who knows. But anyway, this is the kind of guess that you can make because it make sense. There's something about self-awareness, you know, and you get a feeling when you look at a porpoise in the eye or an elephant, you know, I haven't met an orangutan but, uhm, I bet you get that feeling too. Okay, so what's the deal then? This area is not only making maps of the cortex, the limbic area, the brainstem, and the body itself and linking them together. There's one other area we need to talk about and that will become clear when we talk about, uhm, the nine functions, the prefrontal cortex that I'm gonna mention for you now and then we'll get on our third issue. So, sadly, uhm, years and years and years ago, when, ah, when there were these brain studies in the '80s coming out, ah, on memory and I, I felt like I wasn't being taught anything about the brain even though in medical school I was. Uhm, and yet I knew from my, my professor of, of neuroscience, David Hubel got the the Nobel Prize when I was in school there for showing that the experiences you have shapes the structure of the brain. That's what Hubel, ah, was acknowledge for. And when I went to, uhm, pediatrics and psychiatry training, I thought we'll be talking about that but no one was talking about the brain at all. They were just saying, "Here, give this pill cuz it probably does something to Ray(ph), something, and lower something else." You know, that's what we were told. That's all we knew. Well, let's just find it. But then, when you look at the brain science of memory, you could find this out. And around the same time, late '80s, I was fascinated with narrative and there was all this stuff coming about the brain. So, in 1990, it was a bidg decade of the brain so for me it was like being a kid in the candy store to dive into the science of all the stuff which I got in National Institute of Mental Health grant to do. And to try to weave them together with a attachment research in brain science was really, really fun. And for me as a therapist, it became really, uhm, a challenge to see-- could we translate brain science into effective tools for psychotherapy? And that's when I started doing in the late '80s and early '90s. And one of the things that came up was, uhm, to try to figure out the following problem. I'm a child and adolescent psychiatrist and I take care of families. And I had a seven-year-old who, uhm, came to me because she had selective mutism. She stops speaking. And, ah, so, you know, I brought her in. I was trying to assess things with the dad, with the mom, all the things are going on. And one day, we're doing this play therapy and the ball we're tossing back and forth cuz I wanted her have collaboration and connection even though she wouldn't say anything. The ball went behind a couch and behind the couch, I had stuff this kind of video player with a screen and she got all animated. So I said, uhm, "Do you wanna bring a video in?" And she shook her head. So the next week when she came in, she had a video. And we got the machine and hooked up and everything else kind of fun. And we put the video in and we sat on the couch. And then on this screen was incredibly beautiful interaction. During her dad-- it was a, a thing of her dad birthday party. But i-- on the screen was this girl Leanne and her mother, Barbara. This beautiful attunement of a mom who is absolutely crazy about her daughter, swinging her around and dancing and laughing in the father's birthday who was-- he's giggling and you can kinda see the camera going up and down, full of joy, full of happiness, full of connection. And then, Leanne speaks for the first time. And she says, "That's how my mom used to be." And the woman who would bring her and who was at the waiting room at that moment was totally different. Barbara sadly after they move from the East Coast to LA had gotten to a car accident and was just going out to get some milk for the kids, didn't put on safety belt, and a drunk driver hit her head on. And without the safety belt along, there was no airbags in those days, you know, the, the-- her head hit the steering wheel. So if you can imagine a steering wheel hitting your head here at full force. And if you take your, your hand model of the brain, it will be right this frontal area we're talking about especially the middle part, that's the way the steering wheel was. So she was hospitalized of course. She was unconscious for a long time. She was, uhm, ah, put into, ah, rehab when she came out of her coma. She had plastic surgery. She had physical rehabilitation. And then, she moved back home after nine months of being away. And that's when Leanna stopped talking. And it was just a few months after that that I-- that's when I met the family. So the family became my patient and I-- when I met along with Barbara and her husband, I, I said, you know, uhm, "Could I take the scans to, ah,-- can I get them from your neurosurgeon? Can I take them to the library?" Uhm, I don't know if I remember the library is. Is it where they actually have books and-- cuz now we everything in the internet but there's no such thing as the internet in those days. So, I took, I took her scans at the neurosurgeon, gave her to give to me, copies of them. I went to the library and I just basically put them out of the table and I got every bit of science that existed back them on what these areas of the brain that were damaged, seriously damaged, uhm, in Barbara, what they were involved in and I made this list. And when I was alone with Barbara and her husband one day, I just said to Barbara, I said, "What's life been like since the accident?" And I will never forget this moment in the session when she just looks at me and she says, "Well, I guess if I had to put a word to it, I guess I would say I lost my soul." And, you know, that's exactly what Leanne was feeling and her two siblings, that even though her mother with all the surgery and everything look like relatively the same physically, there was something profoundly missing. I talked about Barbara and Leanne in this book called Mindsight in the first chapter. It's a painful way to start but it's crucial because when I could try to help the kids and the father understand Barbara in every way they could cuz of the very damage to her brain, and the brain is very adaptive, you can respond but you also need to understand sometimes you can't. Uhm, the family could adjust to what was going on and they can understand. As, as Leanne's older sister used to say, "My mom doesn't love me anymore." And I say, "It's not that she doesn't love you. The part of her brain that would allow her to be feeling that love and awareness is in so damage." And that really helped the kids grow up. Years later, and I can say, Leanne is doing very well. She actually work with me and she wasn't a patient anymore. So she worked on me as a young graduate student and it's beautiful to see how well she's done. But you can approach the loss of anything if you have understanding. And what we're gonna do now is review the list that's expanded since then of what trying to help Leanne and Barbara understand what happened to this area of the brain and how this region is so important for everything we do in therapy. So, this is a list that came from going to the library and trying to help Leanne make sense of what happened to her mom, Barbara. But it's a list as you'll see that has some incredible import for getting ready for us to discuss the third aspect of mind but also for understanding what we do in therapy. Because like Gerald Edelman said this is the region that probably the most important for all of therapy. And I agree with him. And when you hear this list, maybe you will agree with him, too. So here's the list that comes from going to the library. Number one. This area of the brain is extremely important for regulating the body. Body regulation. And in, in simple terms, what it means is the-- from the head part of the brain, he's trimmed out, ah, two branches of what we called the autonomic nervous system branches the, the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches. And sympathetic is like an accelerator, the parasympathetic is like a break. It's much more complicated and that of course-- but the way we need to remember and the way we teach the clients is you're balancing the accelerator and the brakes. It's a very, uhm, accessible metaphor. And that's what's this region does. And that's what I did when I put my hand on roll in the Rollin McCraty's chest. And when that HeartMath and what I did to my own chest was I was leading to a balance of the parasympathetic and sympathetic breaks, ah, uhm, branches of the nervous system, ah, by activating my prefrontal cortex to basically coordinate and balance those differentiated circuits. So, it's the first example we're seeing of integration. Integration is differentiation and then linkage. And if you say why is integration important, it's because it allows coordination and balance. And at this very number one of the nine of prefrontal, things you're gonna see, these are all integrative functions. An integration have you consider is what we do in therapy. An integration is health, creates harmony in the face of potential chaos or rigidity. Anyway, that's one example. So body regulation. Number two-- and Barbara-- I'm not gonna keep on saying this-- but Barbara lost all nine of what we're about to say is sadly. Number two is a word called attunement or attuned communication. Attunement, let's just define it as focusing attention in the internal world, so you're tuning into the internal world. In attachment research, we just use the word attunement that should be modified for meaning interpersonal attunement. You tune into the internal world of another but years later, when I by accident gotten this word "mindfulness" which I hadn't-- never actually heard about embarrassingly. Uhm, I think mindfulness is a form of the internal attunement. So just like in attachment where we-- are respectful and accepting and loving to the internal world of another person, that's interpersonal attunement of secure attachment, in mindful awareness, we are tuning to our own internal world with these four elements that I ha-- as you second acronym they call you're curious, you're open, you're accepting, and you're loving. That call stance is what we bring to attachment relationships that are full of love and to mindful awareness that it's full of self-compassion. So, that's what attunement is. When you've damaged this are of the brain, you don't do it. It's why Leanne became selectively mute because she wasn't getting the very nurturance of feeling felt that she'd gotten for the first six years of her life. It's a horrible, horrible loss. That's number two, attunement. Number three is, uhm, emotional balance. That's a scientific term meaning you allow your emotional states to be reft up enough so life has meaning, not too reft up so they are not-- it's chaotic and not so depleted so it's rigid. So in many ways, emotional balance is a scientific study of all process that illuminates the fundamental nature of integration. When you're in balance you're in harmony. When you're not in balance you're either in chaos or rigidity. Is that make sense? And for me, cuz I know we'd probably want of time to get to it, just a, a parenthetic comment and if you read the Developing Mind you know what I'm about to say, I think of emotion because no one has a share definition of it, I personally think from an interpersonal neurobiology point of view, emotion can be defined as a shift in integration. So the whole field of positive psychology can be seen as amplifications of integrative states. So, what we called positive emotions like joy and excitement and love are amplifying integration. But there are states that decrease integration. They may not get all the way to chaos and rigidity but they decrease it. And those would be like prolonged anger, prolonged sadness, prolonged fear and those are decrease levels of integration. Anyway, for me, that's what emotion is. It's a shift in integration. And that helps us when we understand why we're talking about emotional well-being as therapist. Cuz another way of saying emotional well-being is integrative well-being. And why we talked about people having emotional problems is they have problems with integration. Cuz I never understood it before people have emotional problems. I say, "Was that mean your emotion is coming to you and saying, you know, I don't like where you put your fence. Move your fence." you know, it's like a problem in the neighbor. You know, well, when you understand it as integration as a larger frame, you understand why people use the word emotion. "I'm having an emotional problem. I had an emotionally tough day." You talked to anyone who said an emotionally tough day, you'll see they had a challenge to staying integrated. It totally shifts and deepens your understanding what that phrase means. Okay. So emotional balance is literally a scientifically studiable thing mediated by the prefrontal cortex. So that's number three. Number four, I, I made up this term cuz the scientific terms are so wacky. I can't remember what they are now. But response flexibility. Response flexibility is what it sounds like. It allows you to pause before choosing among a range of options so you can choose flexibly how you respond. So, I just called it response flexibility. And what it is, is if you think about it, it's basically the way brain is putting a halt on turning an impulse into an action. So this pause that you create is the difference between someone-- if you know "the marshmallow study" who just eat the marshmallow or someone who can wait. It's a prefrontal assessment you're doing that as you know from those studies in Stanford, yoyu know, turn out to be the best predictor of how people turn out in their adulthood is whether they eat the marshmallow or not. They took-- right, you, you get a personal marshmallow. You say, "Listen. If you don't eat it now, I'll be back in two minutes, you have two to take home." And you know, what they do they put their hands behind their back saying, "No, no. Ya, ba, ba, ba, ya, na, na, na," like this but they don't eat it. Then, 40 years later, you do much better than the person that just pops in your mouth. I just did it. I don't need two, I have one now. Anyway, that's a prefrontal function that we think is shaped by attachment as you'll see. Okay, so response flexibility. Number five is soothing fear. We now know you literally grow inhibitory fibers that secrete things like GABA, Gamma aminobutyric acid from the prefrontal cortex especially the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in the right side-- but don't worry about that, just prefrontal-- uhm, to the amygdala. And literally, rel-- bless you. Let-- let's have a bless you for everyone who's gonna sneeze today. So you, you are gonna basically grow these ihibitory fibers, and if I can do this well too if someone else sneezes, my inhibitory fibers said, "Don't say bless you again, Dan," uhm, cuz everyone has been blessed. So, so you grow these fibers down. That's how you undo trauma and unde-- do a phobia. So, studies show in animals that if you can block the newly grown inhibitory fibers, you release the traumatic repertory behaviors. It's amazing. So we now know that kind of detail. As one of young patients said when I was teaching here to do a, a reflective practice, this Mindsight practice to grow those fibers, she said, "Oh, you're gonna have me secrete GABA goo onto my irritated amygdala." And I thought, "Yeah, that sounds beautiful." Yeah. And, you know, it worked. She had this image. She worked hard, she worked hard, and she got her GABA goo to be soothing the irritated amygdala. It's beautiful. Okay, so it's number five. Number six, let's just call it insight, the, the fancy term of the self-knowing awareness which, ah, Endel Tulving has this term called "autonoetic consciousness", self-knowing awareness. Endel also has this beautiful-- Endel Tulving is a scientist of Toronto. He has this beautiful phrase that I love, love, love called "mental time travel." Mental time travel is the ability to think about the past and where you've been in the past, be aware of where you are in the present, and then imagine where you like to go in the future. Isn't that a beautiful phrase? Mental time travel. So, let's just call it insight. I think of it, you know, a-- as having what I called a mindsight map of me. You know, when I was in medical school, literally, uhm, when I saw all these professors not show empathy to their patients or their students, I dropped out of school and I went journeying around doing different things. But when I decided to go back to school, I made up this word "mindsight" back in 1980 telling me that some people see the mind of others or themselves and some people don't. And if I'm gonna go back to school, I've gotta realize that these professors probably haven't change and rather than learning from them as role models, I should think of them as anti-role models. You know, sometimes it's good to see a bad play so you really appreciate the good one. So, I would have like in the front of my mind this term mindsight. When I went back to school, it was a, it was a lifesaver to me. And then when I went to pediatrics and when I went to psychiatry, i-- it was like this closet little lifesaver I kept on having because I noticed that in the psychiatry teachers didn't have it so much which kind of shocking. Uhm, but it was true because in medicine, you have it kick out of you. It's unbelievable and studies have actually showing that. Medical students start with pretty good levels of empathy. First year, second year, it goes down to third year, fourth year residency, it plummets. It's unbelievable. So, some of the work we're doing at UCLA is try to, you know, have it or not have it, But it's hard. It's, ah, it's engrained in the culture, the medical culture. Okay, so basically, mindsight is something that is mediated by prefrontal cortex and other areas too. We'll just use that as a symbol of it. But you're making a mindsight map of me. Who I have been in the past? Who, who am I now? Where would I like to go? The, the next one, the seventh one is empathy. So empathy is basically I'm making a mindsight map of you. Who are you? What are you feeling? Where are you-- where have you been? What, what does this mean to you? What's the context in which this thing is happening? So, literally, we can show amazingly in the brain-- we can do this back in 1980. In 1980, we barely even had a term that came out in '78 called "theory of mind" so no one was thinking about the mind-- mapping the mind. But now we do in all sorts of words like mind, mind, and there's psychological mind and there's mentalization, reflective function, those are all things that comes in. It's beautiful to see the science of that. And we even know in the brain where do you make these theory of mind maps. You make them in the prefrontal cortex and other areas, too. So it's not just this alone. So, you make a mindsight map of you for empathy. It's basically imaging what it's like to be the other person. So, it's different from compassion which is like feeling with another person wanting to help them in their suffering. And compassion and empathy are-- have fascinating relationships with them. They're in a huge scientific debate in terms in their role and mindful awareness and certainly their own psychotherapy. And I'll just give you this take home message that, uhm,-- a, a friend of mine's daughter, ah, has just become a therapist and joined our ranks. Let's hear it for her. And I, I do believe and I, I mean this with all of my heart, this is the most amazing time to become a therapist. We never needed it more and we are in a great position in our field, all of mental health, to really use science to help people's minds and help their lives and help the world really. So, she got brunt out in her first six months. And so my friends, you know, came to me and said, "Can you do anything?" I said, you know, "I don't know. Do you have her come to see me?" So she came to see me and I said, "Tell me what you're doing and-- when you see your patients." She goes, "Well, they come in and I'm working in the clinic where 80% of the people have been severely sexually abuse, or physically abuse, or emotionally abuse and by the end of the day, I'm absolutely wiped out. And when I go home, I can barely sleep and in the morning I don't wanna go to work. And I'm thinking about stopping. I said, "Well, tell me exactly what you do when you sit down with the client." And she says, " Well, I'm-- I do-- just supposed I'm emphatic with them." And I, I said, "Okay." and I said, "What is that mean?" She said, "Well, they come and they start talking about their life and then something usually comes up about their life and gets the trigger to the trauma when they're young kids depending on these abusive caregivers." And I go, "And then what would you do?" She goes, "Then I imagine what it would be like if I were them." And I'll go, "Okay." And I should have said, "How's that working for you," but I didn't. I did not do that. I said, I said, "That's really hard to imagine when-- if that were you." I said, "Have you ever tried imagining what it's like to be them?" She goes, "That's not really emphatic." She said that to me. I said, "Well, I appreciate your saying cuz you have a, a mental model on your mind that empathy means putting yourself in the experience of other person and in fact, that's kind of what it means. Am is in empathy as it feel, so you're putting your feelings in them. But what if you just shift and thought of empathy as I really wanna know what they feel like? You're making a mindsight map of that person. You're not putting yourself in that person's life cuz obviously, you're burning out." And I told her the neuroscience study which she probably know which is basically if you do those two different things, if you put a person in the brain scanner, show them a picture let's say of a horrendous car accident and ask the subject to imagine if that were you, condition one, condition two is, imagine what it's like to be that person that was in the car accident. Very different sound subtle. I-- in one condition, the person's brain goes haywire and they shut down. In the other condition, they activate the circuitries of compassion not just empathy that is getting ready to carry out an action that will help another person. Which condition is which? Throughout the one where you're imagining what is like for that person doesn't flood you and gives you the, the entry into compassion. Compassion is being defined as I feel with compassion as-- so this a, this is a Latin versus Greek, but it's with feel. "I feel with you. I sense your, your suffering not mine, your suffering but I feel it. I resonate with you. I don't become you," which is what I said to my friend's daughter. I said, "You're becoming the other person. That's like mirroring. You don't wanna mirror it." "But aren't there mirror neurons?" I said, "Yeah, but they should be called sponge neurons." You know, you should sponge in the other person. You shouldn't become the other person. It was an Italian thing about language they called mirror neurons. They're not mirrors. You're sponging. You sponge up the internal state of another person. You don't become the other person. It's like two strings in a guitar. You maintain your differentiated state but you're influenced by another person. That's resonance. Integration, I said to my friend's daughter, is not blending. It's very important. It's not becoming the other. It's not a smoothie, it's a fruit salad. Ah, ah, I'm serious. She was becoming a smoothie. Oh, my god! And so, she comes home, she littered bru-wuh-wuh, she's ground up. So I said, "You wanna be a fruit salad. You wanna maintain the integrity that you are therapist who's developed the skill of compassion and you're getting empathy burn out because some people say there's no such thing as compassion burn out. It's empathy burn out which is the term we started using. Because I saw her two weeks later at a, a-- we're all getting together because she's my family friend, we're getting together I said, "How's it going?" She goes, "Uh! I'm like a different person." She goes, "The day after I saw you, I went in there. I tried what you said. It worked and now, I love being a therapist." And now, I've seen her now-- it's a year later, she's great. She's happy. She's relaxed. She goes to work. She finds meaning in her work. She finds connection in her work. She wants to learn more. She's not burnt out. It's unbelievable. One little fact like that. So this is the idea of understanding the connection with empathy and defining it in certain ways. But empathy doesn't have to be on becoming the other person. I'm just using that as a-- getting into that issue. Empathy would be understanding from another person's point of view. And this is why in the debates I have with the scientists, I even-- in the book, uhm, Brainstorm, you know, I have this whole piece on empathy and how important is to be emphatic. And one of my readers wrote back, "Don't you realize empathy is bad? Aren't you reading the scientific literature? We know it's bad now." So, I wrote back. I said, "You know, compassion is impossible without empathy." She goes, "Really?" I said, "Yeah." So if you wanna add empathy in its right context and you wanna have it a gateway to compassion to the self and others so you're feeling empowered to help them, you serve them. You don't have to change their lives completely. We serve. We're not to save. You know, and that serve, they maybe save, they maybe change completely, maybe not. But you'll get burnt out if you think that you're gonna save every human being on this planet. So this was for her would help. It would help for all of us. Okay, so that's making a mindset map of you. Number eight is the mindset map of we. So we have a mindset about me for insight, mindsight map of you for empathy, mindsight map of we for morality. Thinking about the larger social good, activating behaviors for the larger social good even when you're alone, even when you're alone and imagining larger social good. It's really where you realize you are define as being part of something larger than your bodily-defined self. That's a mindset map of we. And then, the final one, the ninth one is intuition which will just define as accessing the wisdom of the body into awareness. So we know that there are non-rational-- it doesn't means irrational-- non-rational information processing around the intestine, around the heart that move up into awareness and influence our decision. Okay, so I want you to look at these list of nine. Let's review them. Body regulation, attunement, emotional balance, response flexibility, soothing fear, insight, empathy, morality, and intuition. How many of you would like to have these nine in your clients outcome for an effective psychotherapy? Please raise your hand. Okay. It's interesting. Right? Now, what's fascinating about this is this comes from taking care of Barbara and-- after the brain accident, the, the accident that injured her brain. And you can see then that there are five fundamental areas that allow those nine to be made. You're linking the differentiated information streams from the cortex, the limbic area, the brainstem, the body, and as you can see the social world about their brains if you will. So social somatic, brainstem, limbic and cortical are five independent-- relatively independent streams of information flow that are being coordinated and balanced by the prefrontal cortex. That's why it's an integrative region and that's why it's so important in what we do in psychotherapy. Now when I learned this taking care of Barbara as I was moving forward and my work is an attachment researcher, I noticed something that was mind-blowing. Ho-- it turns out tha the first eight of those nine are proven outcomes of secure attachments. We just didn't study intuition. This is attachment research that never look at the brain. And then by accident, I got into the field of mindfulness because, you know, I, I, ah, with my daughter's preschool director, Mary Hartzell, we wrote a book called, ah, Parenting From the Inside Out which took the amazing finding from developed mental science attachment research that said the number one best predictor of a child's attachment-- you know what it is? The parent's shoe size. No, no. If you're odd, if you have an odd shoe size, that's really great for your kid. Now it's a different kind of soul. It's, it's literally-- the, the best predictor of your child attachment across all the cultures that ever been studied, this was done now in 10,000 subjects have been published. This has been done in 20,000 subjects but the rest haven't publish yet, is how your parent has made sense of his or her life. So the making sense process for me is a massively integrative process. It integrates a bunch of-- across the bunch of domains we'll talk about soon and this is-- what's so exciting about is when Mary and I wrote the book, we said one of the main principles of a size making sense in having joy in your life and all those kinds of stuff is to be intentional in what you do. So Mary and I said, "Gosh! Intentional is kind of wonky. Let say be mindful, be mindful as a parent. So we did that. When, when parents went in our workshops and they said, "Oh, when are you gonna teach us to meditate?" We said, "What are you talking about cuz Mary and I had never meditated." They go, "Well, you said meditation is the most important principle of parenting." And we said, "What?" And they opened the book and pointed toward mindful and I said, "Yeah, that's being intentional." They're going, "No, that's a form of meditation." I said, "What kind of meditation they go?" "Mindfulness meditation." I have never heard of it. It was just around for 2,500 years, actually 2,600 years. But I was so, I was so worried about doing anything upbeat. Cuz I was already saying as a psychiatrist that relationships shape the brain which people thought but nutty and they thought that might not, you know reinforcing the DSM as a reified kind of super book, ah, was also a little nutty. So I was always trying to do things that work within, ah, you know, the balance of science. And at that time, this was in 2003, basically nothing was published on the science of mindful awareness really. Believe it or not. Ten years later, there's huge amount of stake over 400 articles but in those days there wasn't. So, around that time at another big meeting like this at a network, I was asked to be on this-- the, the, the, uhm, ah, a panel with this guy named Jon Kabat-Zinn who I'd never really heard of. But, uhm, but I read his books to get ready be on the panel with him and I was to start to define that even though they weren't really studying the brain, in Jon's book and the research that had just been published, the outcomes for mindful awareness training included all nine prefrontal functions. It's amazing. And about three weeks after I was giving-- or maybe less-- but anyway, around that time I was giving that lecture with Jon Kabat-Zinn. I went up to, to Harvard and I was giving this keynote address and I said I don't know anything about mindful awareness but it's really weird you've got three overlapping things, the integrative functioning of the prefrontal cortex, secure attachment with the eight of the nine, and mindful awareness. So I said, "I'll bet you of someone studies the changes in the brain structure with mindful awareness, you'll show the prefrontal cortex, ah, grows its integrative, ah, you know, circuits." And a guy come to me afterwards. He leans over to me because, "Don't tell him yet but we're just gonn publish that in about four months." And it turns out Sarah Lazare, in four months later, published her important study that shows these prefrontal integrative fibers grow. And all sorts of studies that comes up since supporting this idea that mindful awareness generates integrative functions in the brain. So, it comes just from this kind of scientific reasoning of interpersonal neurobiology. What so exciting about it is if you stay grounded in science, you then can show the applications in different fields. So we have this funny thing where mental health or at least the wish for us is mental health measures to an outcome of psychotherapy for, uhm, eight of the nine for secure attachment, nine of the nine for mindful awareness, integrative functions of the brain. And when I teach at schools, I say to teachers-- they say, "How can we know if our seniors in high school are ready to leave home?" And I did this just the other night at the town hall in Seattle, ah, that was the question asked and I went over these nine prefrontal functions be went nuts these teachers. Because if you think about it as a parent or a teacher, we have the ability to grow these fibers. With these mindsight skills you can learn. So in the Brainstorm book, that's why I did this. I said, "You can grow the integrative capacity of the brain. So let's move to the third thing now that we reviewed the brain structures, and I hope you're okay with this amount of detail. But now we can go to the third issue. We've said the mind-- the word mind includes subjective experience. It includes consciousness which may has as a subset subjective experience. We've said, "Okay, let's look at the brain and understand that a little bit." Now let's look at this third aspect of mind which is now our definition. But I'm gonna propose to you, we in the field of mental health can be the first discipline to offer a definition of the mind, not just a description of which was we're talking about. And I wanna suggest to you that the reason we need to do this, you know, it's not done in the field of academic psychology or psychiatry, or anthropology, or philosopy, we need to this. Because if we're really gonna be professionals saying we're mental health professionals, we need to define what we are. And if we don't have a definition of mental, well, as my mother-in-law would say we're mental. Uhm, that was she says to me. She says, "How's your mental patients?" Uhm, I say, "Mom, come on, you know, don't talk like that." Uhm, but the idea is, the idea is if we're mental health professionals, we're gonna know what the mental is. The second thing is, if we don't know what the mental is, the mind, how can we possibly say what a healthy mind is if we don't know what a mind is? So, I just think it's time to really define what we do. And I hope as we go through this next part, you'll see the incredible practical import to it and why-- when I have a young student around me, I said, "They say I'm thinking about being mental health professional but seems so gooey, I said it's not gooey. It is super scientific and it's super exciting and it's unbelievable gift to the planet if you decide what you wanted to do. Because we can actually embrace each other as mental health professionals not just to work with individuals or families and groups. But actually there's a lot in the planet as you'll see when we get to the end of this section. Okay, here we go. It's a long line of reasoning. And, uhm, in this setting, with the amount of time we have left, I'm just gonna go for take home points. But if you read the Pocket Guide to Interpersonal Neurobiology, ah, you will see a lot of the background to this take home points. So even though they're gonna seem like bullet points that get to the take home messages, I think in this setting that's important but it's all published already. So, it's all there. I'm not avoiding it. It-- avoid written about it. So, let's get to the take home points. Number one, I feel that beyond descriptions of the mind which is what we just did, subjective experience, consciousness, all of that, or even saying the brain is neural firing, those are descriptions. I don't think that's accurate but that's what people say. Those are descriptions. Here's a definition of a third aspect of mind. I'm gonna give it to you and I'm gonna take it apart. Here's, here's the definition. This third aspect of the mind not explaining away consciousness or explaining away subjective experience. They maybe related or not. Uhm, this third aspect of mind can be defined as an embodied, and relational, self-organizing, emergent process that regulates the flow of energy and information. Let's repeat it. And now I'm gonna say really it slowly and I'm gonna take each word apart. In embodied, so what we're saying just with that one word embodied is the mind is more than what happens in your head. Does anyone feel that's probably true? Anybody. This is to see if you're still awake. Okay, not, not many. Okay, so, so some of you were still with the ideas of the brain. You might be right but we're saying it's embodied not in skull. Second thing, and relational. We're taking the bold and very unpopular stance that even the field of social neuroscience absolutely does not embrace cuz I've talked with the leaders in that field. I was actually sad and shocked that they don't but this. They see the brain creates activity that responds to social signal-- signals and that's their social neuroscience. And in interpersonal neurobiology, we actually think that's only part of the story. We're saying that there's a relational process that you can study, for example, in a family. You can study in a psychotherapeutic relationship. You can study it in a parent-child relationship. You can study it in a group. You can study it in a community. You can study in a society. You can study it in a culture. So in our center that I help run in UCLA that just lost its funding but we have it for 12 years anyway, it's the Center for Culture, Brain, and Development. Ah, for 12 years, I think our website still at-- y ou can see what we've been studying. Center for Culture, Brain, and Development help culture influences brain functioning. Okay, so embodied and relational. I just wanna warn you if you go to a party tonight with the bunch of neuroscientists, they will scuff at back or they'll-- even worse, they will tell you a reversing science. Right now, between me and you is a relationship. A relationship is basically how we share energy and information flow. The embodied nature of mind how energy and information flows through the embodied mechanism of that. It can be through the nervous system including their head brain, going through the heart, intestines and endocrine systems, their immune system. There's lot of way where energy and information happens in an embodied fashion. The embodied mechanism is what we mean by the embodied part of mind but there's also the relational part. This make sense of her? Self-organizing emergent? What is that mean? Uhm, there's a long story behind this but I'm gonna give you just the take home messages. When you look at the system that the mind relates to the system, how many of you feel in your own experience that your feelings or your thoughts or your memories or all the stuff that we know is the mind are shaped by what happens between you and other people. Anybody feel that way? Yeah, okay. We have to explain that it's part of the system of mind. So, what would a relationship share with the head brain or with the whole body even if you just keep it in the body. What I'm gonna suggest you is to what those two entities share as a system is energy and information flow. Flow means change across time, not even space, just time. Energy, a physicist tells us is the capacity to do stuff, comes in different forms like air w-- air molecules moving for sound, ah, photons coming, bouncing off my body coming to you for light and sight, uhm, you couldn't have touch. In the brain we have electrical energy in the form of ions moving at an internal membranes. You have chemicals being released. That's chemical energy. If you have to say what the nervous system does in a simple way, it's electrochemical energy pattern transformation. That's it. And that's what a relationship is, is how we share energy and information among us. Okay, so when you look at the system as energy and information flow, you realize this is not popular and I can't tell you how many scientists have literally accosted me for taking the stance. So, they maybe totally right and this could be wrong. I don't think so. When I told the interns let's prove this is wrong, we couldn't find a single thing to prove it wrong and huge amounts to support it. It doesn't prove it. Just support it. So, keep in mind I could be totally wrong when about to save you which is let's keep in our mind and see how it goes that the system, because the system is energy and information flow, that flow takes different forms that are all based on physics cuz I had so many people say, "Oh, that's so unscientific. You're saying energy. It must be in California." And I said, ah, literally, I said, "Well, isn't physics like a form of science?" And they go, "We should never talk about physics and the mind." I said, "Why not?" They go, " "They do different domains of reality." And I go, "What?" Why would they be-- why are you evoking a different domain?" They go, "Why not?" I said, "Well, let's just start with one domain and see if where we'll go with that one." Anyway, so the system now here-- look at this, the system is energy and information flow. Now, where's that flow happening? Within us and between us. There's no reason to use the skin or the skull to demarcate the mind. I'm serious. No reason. It is a perversion of language and attitude. So watch the system. What is the-- what are the features of the system? The system has three really important features. Number one, the system of energy and information flow-- and think about your own mental lives-- is called "open" meaning stuff from outside of whatever itself is influences it. Do you feel that sometimes like stuff happens, it influences you? So, we're open systems. Are you capable of being chaotic? How many field they had in life can be chaotic? So you are a chaos capable open system. And then, are you a non-linear system? Meaning, small inputs lead to large and unpredictable results. And if you feel your life is non-linear, if you heard Jeff Zieg's beautiful introduction and he talked about meeting, you know, ah, this im-- important moment as I happened-- trying to remember the date. When did he say he-- December 2nd, he meets this mentor for him, right? He meets this mentor and his life has changed. If you hadn't met, it will gone with direction. That's the example of non-linearity. Here's the story, if you're non-linear and you're chaos capable and your open, if you meet those three criteria which I say mental life does, energy information flow within you and between you, you are what's called a complex system. That's a mathematical term. Now, you don't need to get freak out actually complexity is very simple. So complexity is not the same as complicated cuz a lot people say, "Dan, don't tell me that I want my life to be simplified not complicated." Complexity is just a math term and you don't-- we're not gonna do any math but were gonna learn from that science. Everyone is going, "Oh my god math." No, don't worry about it. Here's the thing. In mathematics you have a division of math called probability theory. Within probability theory, you have systems theory, how things function. Within systems theory, you have complex systems, a related thing but not identical chaos theory. This is where we gonna get complexity theory. Complexity theory tells us that if you are open and chaos capable and non-linear, you are a complex system, period. So that's just from the science. That's not from, you know, soft speak, it's from literally the math. So that's the first statement. We are complex systems. Next statement. When you look at complex systems what you find is they have some they called emergent properties. An emergent property is something that arises from the interaction of the elements of the system. In this case, we've defined the elements of the system as energy and information flow. And so, what's arising from it, the, the, uhm, interaction of the elements of the system is not something it's programmed by anybody. There's no Bill Gates program or-- of complexity. It's just a natural function of the systems. So, one emergent property that has what it called recursive, recursive elements which is basically like Edelman's notions of reentry in the brain. Recursivity means a thing arises from something and turns back in influences itself. That's reentry. Reentry is one example of a compex system having a recursive feature. Fine. Proferssor Edelman didn't mention this cuz he doesn't talk about of it but that's fine. We can look at recursivity and emergence and look at one particular emergent property of the mind, of this complex system, of energy information flow within us and between us, and here is the name of it, self-organization. Self-organization is an emergent property of complex systems, period. That's point number two. Point number three, self-organization moves the system and I'm gonna say it one time and it freaks everybody out but I need you to know the science and I'm gonna drop it. But to optimizing complexity and-- when I teaching that people say, "Don't say that. Don't say," but you need to know. That's what the math says. T-- translate that to English. It optimizes harmony. Think about a choir. When a choir sings, it is the most complex when they sing in harmony. When a system, this is point number-- where are we on? Four of five, was it? Point number four. Self-organization when it's moving optimally, moves the system with the following five characteristics that I, I pulled from the math but they spell a word cuz you know, I'm a acronematic by now and this is your third acronym FACES, F-A-C-E-S. It's flexible, it's adaptive. It has the mathematical quality called coherence which means things stick together in a fluid dynamic way. That's coherence. F-A-C. E, it's energize. S, it's stable. Let's recite that together and get your hippocampus activated. What is FACES stand for? 

02:33:55
UNKNOWN Flexible, adaptive, coherence, energize, stable. 

02:34:00
DANIEL SIEGEL Exactly. I could have said it better myself. So, so FACES flow happens, life is always unfolding. Self-organization is a verb not a noun. You're always self-organizing, okay. It's like, "Oh, now I'm done. I've self-organized." The closet is ready, no. It is-- it's a constant unfolding things even right now between me and you. So I am picking your signals, responding to them, you're taking about we're going like this. We are part of one system. The mind is being created now, not within me, not within you, within us and within individuals. So here is the amazing thing that FACES flow for me. I was going nuts. This is the early '90s. I was like driven out of my mind. I said every patient I saw was coming with either chaos or rigidity or both. No matter what their history was or what their issue was, they could come with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or they can come with trauma, they can come with, you know, of child abuse, whatever it was, they were all come with chaos rigidity. So I thought you, you either like, like add in your mind whatever that was cuz none to me it was, but-- or your, you know, something is here. So I went nuts searching for some science. They could say, why would something fall into chaos, rigidity or both. And the only place I could find it, the only place I can find it was in math, you know? So I went to the math books, in the complexity theory. This is what it says. When a system is not optimally self-organizing, it moves out of that-- it's regulating those terms-- it moves out of that harmony, that FACES flow, and it moves either the chaos or rigidity. And you're always kinda going a little bit toward chaos, a little bit toward rigidity, you're always moving fluidly but you can't get stuck there. So that, literally, I screamed out so loud. I woke up my kids upstairs. I could not believe it. There it was. Because I pulled down the DSM three at that time and I looked at every symptom of every syndrome was chaos or rigidity. And I said, "Oh, my god! The mind must be a self-organizing process and that's why these are called mental disturbances even though there's nothing that the DSM that says that, ah, but that's how we can reinterpret the DSM. And then I started seeing my patients in a different way and then I started saying, "You know, something? What does the map say?" Optimizes the self-organization. And this also led me to scream so loud. I couldn't believe it. Linking differentiated parts of the system optimizes self-organization. It creates the harmony. It's unbelievable. Now, let me ask you guys a question cuz we could-- this will take three minutes. Do you wanna see a demonstration of that? 

02:36:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:36:50
DANIEL SIEGEL Do I need you to sing in a choir? Okay, I want some choir singers to come on up here. We're gonna have you to do a demo actually just for safety sake. But actually, come on up here. Let's just do this quick. And as the choir singers are coming up, let me just say when you feel this-- come on up here please. We just need-- yeah. So you're gonna now experience, ah, the chaos, experience rigidity, or you'll experience both thing. 

02:37:20
UNKNOWN Might I veiw... 

02:37:20
DANIEL SIEGEL Good, good, good, good. Come on up. Very good. 

02:37:25
UNKNOWN Hello. 

02:37:25
DANIEL SIEGEL All right. Look at all these volunteers. This is great. 

02:37:30
UNKNOWN Nauseating 

02:37:30
DANIEL SIEGEL All right, beautiful. Okay, so you're gonna, you're gonna see three examples. I guess this what happens when you ask 2,000 people if they're choir singers. Uhm, you're gonna see three examples and for all of us again, allow to arise an awareness whatever you feel because this is gonna take the concepts and anchor them in your body, okay. So what I'm gonna ask you to do and, and we'll do three examples. The first example, uhm, if you could-- Roberta, if you could, ah, pick a note and everyone-- when I raise my hands, you just sing the note. I'm gonna have to go down here. Okay, so pick a note and then when I raise my hands just sing the same note. And when I put it down, you stop the note. 

02:38:15
UNKNOWN C. 

02:38:15
DANIEL SIEGEL Okay, do you want it? 

02:38:15
UNKNOWN Let's make it. 

02:38:15
DANIEL SIEGEL Or anyone, or anyone feels comfortable making a note. 

02:38:20
UNKNOWN We will come right on you. 

02:38:20
UNKNOWN We will come right on you. 

02:38:25
UNKNOWN Hmm, ah... 

02:38:25
DANIEL SIEGEL And you can take a breath. 

02:38:30
UNKNOWN Ah... 

02:38:35
[sil.] 

02:38:40
DANIEL SIEGEL Very good. So, uhm, now imagine if that went on for three hours unchanging. Just imagine it. Okay, the next one is don't do anything. I give you the full instructions but you listen to the instructions cuz I'm gonna have you to do it too. So what I'm gonna have you to do is I'm gonna have you soon plug your ears so tightly, you cannot hear each other and-- not yer-- but what I'm gonna ask you to do then is take a song in your head, ah, or whatever it is in your body, pick a song inside yourself and, ah, and I want you to sing it as loudly as you can. 

02:39:10
UNKNOWN Oh! 

02:39:15
DANIEL SIEGEL When I raise my hands. 

02:39:15
UNKNOWN Go! 

02:39:15
DANIEL SIEGEL Close your ears. 

02:39:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

02:39:30
UNKNOWN What I look like. 

02:39:35
DANIEL SIEGEL So now-- so everyone can learn from this. I want you to do the same thing. So plug your ears really tightly and you think of a song and belt it out. Okay, go. 

02:39:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

02:40:00
DANIEL SIEGEL Give them a-- very good. Okay, now I know this is a big group, uhm, so it's gonna be hard but get together and sing a song. 

02:40:10
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah. 

02:40:10
UNKNOWN What song are we doing? 

02:40:15
UNKNOWN Now, you... 

02:40:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

02:40:20
DANIEL SIEGEL Amazing Grace? Okay. 

02:40:20
UNKNOWN I'm your watcher. 

02:40:20
DANIEL SIEGEL All right. Are you ready? 

02:40:25
UNKNOWN Amazing Grace. 

02:40:25
DANIEL SIEGEL Amazing Grace? Okay. So I'm not gonna do anything. You guys can do it with yourselves even though you never, you never sing together in a choir, right? Okay, go ahead. 

02:40:35
UNKNOWN Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost but now am found, as blind, but now I see. 

02:41:20
[sil.] 

02:41:25
UNKNOWN Beautiful. 

02:41:25
DANIEL SIEGEL Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. So if you don't mind waiting here, we will explore these three experiences. If you-- can you wait for a moment? Wasn't that amazing? Let's do another applause for them. So let's go over each of them. What I want you all to do is think about, uhm, integration is the linkage of differentiated parts. When you're integrated, you create harmony and when you're not, you go to chaos or rigidity. And, ah, when you're not integrated means you're either blocking linkage or blocking differentiation or both. So let's go through example number one. It's a little hard because these are human voices are chopped over tones. But imagine if that went on for an hour or two hours, same note, same way, no variation, would there be differentiation? Would there be linkage? Yes, they are linked but not differentiated. Uhm, what did that feel like for you? 

02:42:20
UNKNOWN Boring. 

02:42:20
DANIEL SIEGEL Boring. It can be boring. It can be monotonous. It can be the same, completely predictable. So that's an example of impaired integration cuz we didn't allow differentiation. So that is example number one, the example of rigidity. Ah, let's do example number two, ears plugged. You both experienced it. What was that like-- what did that sound like? What did that feel like to you? Let's start with that. 

02:42:40
UNKNOWN Chaos. 

02:42:45
DANIEL SIEGEL Chaos. And what did it feel like inside you? Anxious, not good, it was cacophony. That was an example of chaos. Was there differentiation? 

02:42:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:42:55
DANIEL SIEGEL Yes. Was there linkage? No. So, was there integration? No. So here, you see impaired integration, in this case, it was chaos. Okay, now let's see example number three, Amazing Grace. You know there's, there was no conductor, there was no anything I-- what did I say to them? Sing a song together and they did it. Now, the choir singers, they know how to do that but there was-- it was a natural self-organizing process. Was there-- what did it feel like first of all? 

02:43:25
UNKNOWN Happy. 

02:43:25
DANIEL SIEGEL It was amazing, wasn't it? It was, it was beautiful. That was harmony. How did you feel like in your body? 

02:43:30
UNKNOWN It was delightful. 

02:43:35
DANIEL SIEGEL It was delightful, soothing, energized, excellent. So it's flexible, adaptive, coherent, energized, and stable. And, ah, was there linkage? 

02:43:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

02:43:45
DANIEL SIEGEL Was there differentiation? 

02:43:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

02:43:45
DANIEL SIEGEL Yes. So was there integration? 

02:43:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

02:43:50
DANIEL SIEGEL Yes. And now you have inside of you the harmony of integration. So let's hear it again for our singers and thank you for demonstrating for us. Just be careful and you're welcome. So the implications of this as our choir singers go back to their seats, ah, the implications are huge. They're huge. Number one, the implication is that as a self-organizing process, the mind now has a definition. The mind in its long form, it's an embodied and relational, self-organizing emergent process that regulates the flow of energy and information. If you want to say it in short version, the mind is an embodied and relational process that regulates the flow of energy and information. You know it's self-organizing. You have to always include that cuz people get a little wacky. And you don't need to say emergent. I just gave you the full definition. Okay, so we know it's embodied and relational, it happens within you and between you, and then we know there's this incredible set defining. Number one, for clinical assessment, our task is to detect chaos, detect rigidity, detect harmony, the FACES flow. And then instead of being rigidified into a system that's actually now being chucked, the DSM, we can actually rethink it and say, "Okay, our work is about integration. We are integrationists. We are not shrinks. We create integration within and between." So what are the implications? The implications is you can do a clinical assessment by looking for chaos or rigidity and in fact, in the previous Evolution meetings, when they asked me to do clinical demonstrations and I actually-- the first time I did it, I didn't know one of those was. Uhm, you'll see, you can get two of the recorded clinical assessments I do on the two volunteers, ah, I think was in this very room where, where we did that. So, that would be one thing if you wanted to check that out. How do you do that? We have the yearlong program that teaches you how to do that too. The Mindsight book will teach how to do that. The, the, uhm, The Mindful Therapist book will teach you how to do that. So chaos and rigidity, what we look for, you're not examining for what we called domains of integration. There are at least nine domains of integration and I'll review them briefly now just you get a feeling for them. But before I go into depth in those, let me just say that treatment planning then is based on a treatment as-- in a clinical assessment that's different from what were you usually trained to do. So you're learning chaos and rigidity when you detect chaos or rigidity, you know there's a domain that's impaired in either linkage and/or differentiation. Your task like a laser beam is to focus your attention on the domain of integration that's impaired. And different schools of therapy usually to get one or the other and they work on and that's fine. For interpersonal neurobiology, we look at the whole thing including a person's identity within culture cuz that's a form of integration too. We don't separate that. This is not a psychosocial bio model where you put lines in between the two. This is one model of human experience. Okay. The next thing to say cuz I, I, I wanna make sure it's really clear, in the definition before we get to the domains, by having a definition that says the mind is by definition where it-- and I thought when I offered this definition in the early '90s, there'll be a lot of different definitions and it really fun to put them up against each other and we have a co-- a common definition from all the debates, no one has a definition. I mean, this is the freaky thing. That was a social shock for me. So this definition we're putting out there gives us the tool to say if it's a self-organizing process that's regulating energy and information flow, the next point we can make is you as a therapist, where is the mind? You tell me where is the mind. Yes, within and between. The mind is within and between so you need to know about the body and the nervous system and brain science. You do need to know that. And that's what we try to provide synthesis of an interpersonal neurobiology. And the mind is in between. It's in our relationships. Relationships on science is as important as anything else. And you heard this morning we have this new organization which you're all invited to participate in called Relationships First. And it's literally just a way for, let's say, starting with therapist, we get together and we say, "You know, something? Relationships are not just secondary. They are primary in shaping our lives." In fact, every study of medical help, longevity, mental health and happiness show what's the number one shared finding. Relationships, supportive relationships because our minds are created within relationships. We're not to shape by them. They're created there cuz the mind is both embodied and relational. So please join Relationships First. We have a booth, uhm, and you can come there and, and, and hang out. I'll be hanging out at the Relationships First booth. And also, we have the "Mind Your Brain" booth which is the Brainstorm thing you'll see there. Ah, come and hang out because this is a time we have to get out together as mental health professionals and do this. It's time to do this. Okay. The second thing is about this definition. I say the mind is regulatory. There's a huge thing that does that, huge. Regulation is two parts to it. And when you go do therapy starting next week, you can approach therapy very, very differently, this conceptually and then target your work by understanding that regulation is two parts. Number one, when you regulate let's say a car, you gotta monitor where you gonna, gonna have your eyes open, your ears open. So monitoring is first part of regulation. Number two, you have to modify where it going or modulate it. If the-- move the steering wheel, press on the breaks and the accelerator. You can learn to modulate energy and information flow toward integration. So what this model of regulation does is it says, "Wow, this is an amazing moment. I can go to therapy on Monday and I can teach my clients how to monitor with more stability so I see with more depth clarity and detail. Then, once I've talked them the monitor, and those are teachable things, those are mindsight skills, then once I've probably do that, I can teach to modify toward integration." Modify toward integration. That's the whole model. It's that simple and it's that profound. So, in the Mindsight book, for example, you will see detailed case histories that go through how you do in assessment, how do you treatment planning, how do you actually implement the monitoring and modifying changes that transform people's lives. So let's review this domains of integration briefly and just say this that this is an amazing opportunity for us in mental health to take this interpersonal neurobiology frame of all the sciences in one. So, yes, we love neuroscience and, yes, we love anthropology, and, yes, we love relational science. We love all the sciences. So we don't need to be woo-wooed by anyone's science of another. We love science. There's nothing contradictory about science and psychotherapy, but we need all the sciences. The second thing is we have this opportunity take this definition of the mind and turn it into practical applications in people's lives. So here are some of the domains. Number one, the domain of consciousness. And as in any domain of integration, you always ask the question how can we differentiate parts of it and how can we link it. Integration of consciousness involves differentiating the known from the knowing and then all the different knowns from each other. And if you come to the clinical demonstration or even if you can't come, if you go to my website, you can go to drsiegel.com and you can do the Wheel of Awareness. And the Wheel of Awareness is a mindsight practice. Mindsight is insight, empathy and integration. It was the three parts of mindsight. It's a mindsight practice that actually integrates consciousness. And try it yourself. I have all my patients to do it and now we have about a third of a million people download that practice and the responses have been unbelievable. So it's there for you to do. It integrates consciousness. Number two, left or right integration. Iain McGilchrist writes a beautiful book-- wrote a beautiful book called the The Master and His Emissary backing up when I'm about to say. So, it's controversial but just read his book if you want the science behind it. The left and right are very different from each other. And embracing that difference even though in neuroscience you're not supposed the differences for some reason, but if you really look at the science, they are different. They'd been different for hundreds of millions of years. When you look at these differences and you honor the differences and promote the linkages, you can understand how to promote well-being. And a lot of our patients, clients come in without left/right integration. Vertical integration. When you imagine that consciousness arises from thalamic and cortical processing, the higher parts of the brain-- but we have the hand model of the brain, I'll show you limbic and brainstem and body are all very important too. Vertical integration means bringing into awareness something called interoception, preception of the interior. There are many studies now to show that the more interoceptive ability we have, the more vertical integration we have, the more empathy we have, and the more self-regulation we have. It's fantastic. So, vertical integration. And there's memory integration which we already talked about. How do you harness the integrative role? Literally, the integration of the linkage of differentiated parts of the hippocampus is just great to resolve trauma. There's memory integration. That differentiate the elements of implicit memory being linked together. Then, there's narrative integration. How do you extract from memory integration, vertical integration, left/right integration, and consciousness integration meaning? So, you develop this mental tra-- time travel capacity to actually go forward with your prefrontal integration to say this is where I've been. This is what I'm now. You know something? I choose to go this other direction. So mem-- narrative integration. Then, there's state integration. We already saw a little bit of that. You've differentiated states not just reacting receptive but all sort of self states we create, how do you honor those differences and promote linkages across states. So that's the state integration feature. Then there's something we talked about all day long today. It's interpersonal integration. How do you allow people to be different but then linked? That's the biggest challenge of our lives to really know each other's inner subjective lies where we started with within consciousness and allow that difference to be honored with compassion and communication to be facilitated. That's interpersonal integration. It's basically what we do in therapy. Interpersonal integration catalyzes neural integration. This is the key I will need to all psychotherapy. It's that interpersonal integration catalyzes internal neural integration. And neural integration is the basis for all self-regulation. Regulation of emotion, attention, thought, behavior relatedness, interpersonal integration. And the last, two-- the second to the last one is called temporal integration. And temporal integration is the fact that the brain create these maps of time so that we know we're not gonna have what's going on now be permanent. We know in a few minutes this talk is gonna end, for example. We know that, uhm, things are, are not always certain. We don't know exactly what's gonna happen in 10 minutes, right? So, the embracing of uncertainty and a longing for certainty. The embracing of a longing for permanence but the embracing of impermanence. The embracing of longing to be alive, but knowing that we all die. These are parts of temporal integration, these deep existential issues. When you go all across eight of these domains of integration and work on with clients, what I found was that people would start feeling this different sense of identity. And now this, I called it identity integration. I used to call it transperational integration which I still do. Transpire means to breath across. And when you breath across these eight domains of integration something would happen in my patients cuz I'd been doing this for a long time with them. They would start to say things like "I feel like I'm connected to other people in a different way that I've never felt. I feel like I need to be a part of helping other people like I've never felt before. And as I started to go deeply in this in all sorts of ways, it seemed that this was integration of identity. And as I presented in the Brainstorm book for the adolescents and their parents to read, this is the way I think about it. We have a personal skin-defined identity, a me. But the more we really deeply going to this scientifically and in therapy the more we go into it integratively, the more we realize we are not just embodied. We're certainly not just in skulled but we're not just embodied. We are also relational beings. And so there's also a we identity we have. And so for a while, when I was asked to go teaching for the climate change issues and all sorts of things, I would say, "Oh, let's go from me to we." And one of my online students came up to me at a workshop. She said, "I'm really mad at you, Dan." I said, "What are you mad at me about?" She goes, "Now, you're gonna teach me to we." I said, "Ah, what's wrong with that?" She goes, "Well, you told me I should know my own history, I should be in touch with my body, I should know my attachment patterns, I should know who I am, I should save my life, and now you're telling me drop that? It should become we. What's wrong with you?," she said. And I said, "No, no, no. I mean, don't only be a me but also be a we." And she goes, "That doesn't rhyme." So I said, "Okay, okay, okay. How about this? How about this? How about mwe? M-W-E. So an integrated identity would be a differentiated me and a differentiated we and you bring them together into one human being called the mwe. She goes, "I like that." So, what I wanna conclude with is the mwe identity that we can promote has the following characteristics. I know I have an identity in this body, in this skin and that's important. But I also open to the reality that the self does not end at the skin. And now as of July 2013, we have actually a study from Barbara Fredericks and colleagues that was published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Science Jul-- July 2013 that shows if you take on the sense of being connected to a larger whole, the deeper meaning that comes with that, the kind of equanimity that comes with that, uhm, that's called eudaimonia in the Greek term. You will have changes in the molecules, the epigenetic regulatory molecules that control gene expression that will help you prevent diseases like autoimmune diseases and cancer if you embrace this larger identity. You will have more happiness. You'll have sense of well-being. If you realize that your life is not just the internal but it's about the interconnectedness of everything. And so what I wanna leave you with is basically a summary. When you think about integration and this mwe identity, when integration is expanded across all these domains like this, when it's made visible, the outcome is kindness and compassion. And what do you focus in our internal worlds or interpersonal worlds, kindness and compassion are the essence of well-being. And we as the mental health professionals of the world are in incredible position to try to bring kindness and compassion to our clients, to our families, to our friends, and to this larger world could has desperately waiting first to be there for him. Thank you so much for your attention.
