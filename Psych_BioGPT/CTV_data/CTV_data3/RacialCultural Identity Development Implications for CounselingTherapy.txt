DERALD WING SUE  Welcome everyone. Welcome to our lecture series on counseling the culturally diverse, theory and practice. Today's, ah, presentation deals with racial cultural identity development. In actuality ah, this represents a first of a two-part series on racial identity development, particularly with respect to people of color and with respect to White racial identity development as well. This is one of the more important aspects of understanding how to work with individuals of, of color. Racial cultural identity development are impo, is important for several reasons. First of all, it gives us some idea into the important aspects of within group differences. That is not all Asians are alike, not all Blacks are alike, not all Latino-Hispanic Americans are alike and so on. So the question I frequently get asked by a number of my ah, colleagues and students is that, "Can only an African-American counselor or do therapy with another African-American? Can only Asians work with Asians and so on?" My answer really uhm, is, is two-fold. Sometimes it is, uhm, ah, true and sometimes it isn't, and it depends really upon where the cultural identity, the level of racial consciousness of your client resides in. The other thing that is important about uhm, understanding identity development is that it considers how oppression, racism, discrimination affects one's identity development so that the social-political realm becomes a major part of working with people of color. Thirdly, ah, understanding racial consciousness and its development and influence allows you to have an, a good assessment tool to understand your ah, client of color. And lastly as we will see in the last part or our uhm, ah, analysis today, it really has a major intervention implications. What you do is based primarily upon the racial consciousness of your client. Now the idea of identity development first came on the scene uhm, during the contributions of a number of African-American psychologists and scholars. These are individuals that many of you have read about uhm, in, in our book. They are William Cross, ah, Bailey Jackson, Janet Helms, uhm, Clement Montres(ph) were all African-American psychologists who began to conceptualize Black identity development and the implications and meaning. This was followed by a number of other racial-ethnic group individuals who began to apply these concepts to Asian Americans, Hispanic-Latinos, Native Americans, and even GLBT uhm, and, and women groups as well have begun to ah, indicate the importance of identity development. Let me before I get into the particular levels of consciousness that we will talk about today, what I'd like to talk about ah, and give you some idea are some of the racial identity assumptions that many of these models tend to incorporate. One of them is that racism and oppression is a basic and integral part of U.S. society and permeates all aspects of our culture and institutions. You've heard me said this and uhm, prior tapes and so forth that we are all socialized and culturally conditioned into a society that historically has been ah, ah, biased and individual, institutional, and societal factors, and that is uhm, basic and important part of our idea and understanding of identity development. The second basic identity assumption that uhm, most models make is that persons of color are socialized into U.S. society and therefore all of us inherit the biases, the perceptions and stereotypes of the, the particular groups which are portrayed in U.S. society. In other words uhm, as an Asian American, it is highly probable that I have also been exposed to stereotype about Asian Americans that I may not knowingly have incorporated into my own psychological identity. Thirdly, the level of racial identity development, or consciousness development, in an interracial encounter affects the process and outcome of relationships and interpersonal ah, interactions. We are going to ah, may be particularly, this will be evident when we begin to talk about white counselors working with clients of color in terms of their own identity ah, development. The fourth assumption that is very important for us to make is that how people of color perceive themselves as racial cultural beings is strongly correlated with how they perceive and respond to racial stimuli. Consequently race-related reality represents major differences in how they view the world and their particular interaction with people within their own ethnic group and people outside as well. Fifth, it seems to follow the identity development seems to follow a progression or developmental sequence. This is an assumption that, there is an assumption that many people of color that are born and raised in the United States develop from one of incorporating racial biases and stereotypes about their groups and themselves to an expanding realization, and an attempt to overthrow much of the cultural conditioning ah, that is related to who we think we are as racial-cultural beings. The sixth assumption that almost all of the models of identity development make is that the most desirable outcome in the development of your racial consciousness is an identity that accepts your own integrity and does not deny your racial cultural being that is ah, defined in a positive sense. Now what I would like to do to illustrate the five stages that my brother ah, Dave and I talk about in ah, racial cultural identity development, I'm going to read to you a case that seems to evidence a number of these uhm, ah, levels of consciousness. The levels of consciousness that we will talk about today are that of conformity uhm, dissonance, resistance and immersion, introspection, and integrative awareness. Let me read to you an excerpt, and to those of you who are using the book Counseling the Culturally Diverse, uhm, ah, can follow this as well. This comes from a Nisei ah, Japanese of a student journal when I was teaching at the University of California at Berkeley, and this, it's a, a journal entry that she writes about uhm, ah, in her own racial cultural awakening. "For nearly all my life I have never seriously attempted to dissect my feelings and attitudes about being a Japanese-American woman. Aborted attempts were made but they were never brought to fruition because it was unbearably painful. Having been born and raised in Arizona, I had no Asian friends. I suspect that given an opportunity to make some, I would have avoided them anyway. That is because I didn't want to have anything to do with being Japanese-American. Most of the Japanese images I saw were negative. Japanese women were ugly. They had cucumber legs, flat yellow faces, small slanty eyes, flat chest and were stunted in growth. The men were short and stocky, sneaky and slimy, clumsy, inept, wimpy-looking and sexually emasculated. I wanted to be tall, slender, large eyes, full lips and elegant-looking. I wasn't going to be typical Oriental. At Cal, which is a reference to the University of California at Berkeley, I've been forced to deal with my Yellow-White identity. There are so many Yellows here that I can't believe it. I've come to realize that many White pre, ah, prejudices are deeply ingrained in me. I've come to realize this, to accept myself as a total person, I also have to accept my Asian identity as well. But what is it? I ju, just don't know. Are they the images given to me through the filter of White America or are they the values and desires of my parents. Yesterday I had a rude awakening. For the first time in my life I went on a date with a Filipino boy. I guess I couldn't, shouldn't call him a boy as my Ethnic Studies teacher says it is derogatory towards Asians and Blacks, I only agreed to go because he seemed different from the other Orientals on campus. I guess I shouldn't use the word "Oriental" as well. He's president of this Asian fraternity, very athletic and outgoing. When he asked me, I figured, why not? It'll be good experience to see what is like to date an Asian boy. Will it be like White guys who will try to seduce me or will he be too afraid to make any move when it comes to sex. We went to San Francisco's ah, Fisherman's Wharf for lunch. We were seated and our orders were taken before two other White women. They were, however, served first. This was painfully apparent to us but I wanted to pretend that it was just a mix up. My friend however was less forgiving, and made a public fuss with the waiter. Still it took an inordinate amount of time for us to get our lunches and the fillets were overcooked purposely. My date made a very public scene by placing a tip on the table and then returning to retrieve it. I was embarrassed but proud of his actions as well. This incident and others made me realize several things. For all my life, I have attempted to fit in to White society. I have tried to convince myself that I was different, that I wasn't like all the other White uhm, uhm, my other White classmates and that prejudice and discrimination didn't exist for me. I wonder how I could have been so oblivious to prejudice and racism. I now realize that I cannot escape from my ethnic heritage and from the way people see me. Yet, I don't know how to go about resolving many of my feelings and conflicts. While I like my new-found Filipino male friend, because he is sexy, I continue to have difficulty seeing myself married to anyone other than a White man." This case is a powerful example of the type of cultural oppression and stereotyping that our society places on people who are racially, culturally con, ah, different and results in a number of psychological dilemmas and conflicts that this Nisei student copes with. If you again recall that she enunciates a lot of the negative stereotypes in a very angry and painful manner, and well I guess I am saying to all of you is that to understand what it is like to grow up in a society that does not tolerate and that in one way or another pathologizes the life experience of people of color can have damaging and harmful consequences. And this is one of the reasons why I feel racial cultural identity development is indeed a major uhm, aspect of counselor education, clinical training, and so forth. Let me talk about ah, the five stages in a descriptive way. When I begin to talk about stages, it is perhaps better to use the term levels of consciousness because there is quite a bit of, ah, controversy in the field about whether these represents fixed stage entities uhm, like ego statuses or indeed levels of consciousness and whether they occur in a sequential way or not. So my brother and I have, uhm, I tried to integrate many of these models into what we call a descriptive model that describes a process that is on-going and that does not necessarily, uhm, ah, represent distinct identifiable stages. Rather they merge and, ah, flow in terms of its development. The first level of consciousness we call conformity. When you are bre, born and raised in a society that makes you feel ashamed of who and what you are, when it instills in you that certain groups are better, more desirable, like White Americans, it has a devastating impact upon individuals of color who may come to believe those types of representations. Many of you are familiar with the early uhm, ah, Clark Studies, Kenneth and Mamie Clark, two African-American psychologists, indeed, uhm, ah, did studies on Black children in terms of their identity development and the studies were used in Brown versus Board of Education uhm, ah, of a ruling that occurred with the U.S. Supreme, ah, Court. But what their study indicated was that they simply presented a black doll and a white doll to very young African-American, ah, students, very young ones, and asked them of series, of very simple questions, those questions were, "Which is a black doll? Which is the White one? Which is a good one? Which is the bad one? Which one is most like you?" What they found was something quite startling that indicates ah, how harmful racial oppression is. They found in essence that many of the black children identified ah, accurately the black and white dolls all right, but they associated negative "badness" with the black doll and positive qualities with the white doll. When asked to indicate which one was most like them, many of them chose the white doll or showed extreme conflict in selecting the black one. Now this indicates something powerful and insidious in the upbringing of Black children and I would say in the upbringing of children of color across the board is happening uhm, ah, in our society. This is the result of what we called the conformity stage of development which is marked by a desire by people of color to assimilate and acculturate, to accept the melting pot concept of being like what White Americans hold to be ideal physical attractiveness, cultural values, behaviors ah, traditions as being much more desirable than one's own of, ah, group. The individual at the conformity stage tends to accept that the belief in White superiority and the inferiority of their own group. Indeed if you look at the case of the Nisei student here, she indeed had all the negative perceptions about uhm, ah, being Japanese-American. In fact, she expresses considerable rejection of her own racial cultural heritage and in essence of, ah, all of, she seems to buy in the negative stereotypes in some way trying to distance herself because she seems, sees her own race and culture as a, as an, ah, as a handicap to be overcome, something to be ashamed about. There is an unconscious desire ah, to escape one's own cultural heritage as indicated in the case and validation about whether you are someone who has made it in society tends to come from White society, White standards, and White cultures. The role models, the lifestyles uhm, the value systems, tend to all follow the dominant group to which ah, you aspire to, which is in the, this sense, White society. Physical and cultural characteristics identified with one's own group tend to be seen uhm, negatively, to be avoided, denied just like the Nisei student did not want to have anything, uhm, ah, to deal with being uhm, a Japanese. She just wanted to be like all the other White individuals in her state of Arizona and she did not even wanna think about herself as being a, a Japanese-American. The physical characteristics, we have many examples by the way of how conformity uhm, ah, individuals can operate. Uhm, some of you who have read the autobiography of Malcolm X, recall that he too at one, ah, at one time in his life believed in White superiority. He went to great lengths to conk his hair to straighten it out because physically, that was not considered attractive. He dated White women. Uhm, his dating of White women indicated to him internally that he was accepted uhm, ah, into White society. Some individuals also say that, uhm, uhm, many Asian women who's get, uhm, ah, get special eye operations to make them more Westernized and rounded might indeed be suffering from this type of, of racial self-hatred or feeling negatively about one's own physical features and characteristics and this is not difficult to understand when you know that the media portrays more attractive individuals as having light-skinned, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, tall, and, and, and so forth. So there are attempts in many people of color at the conformity stage to appear White in their mannerisms, in their speech, in their dress and the behavior, and ah, what accompanies this, however, is a sense of low internal self-esteem because of the rejection of one's own uhm, ah, cultural heritage. Now one of the things that I'd like uhm, to indicate is that this is a stage of denial. The primary mechanism that allows individuals to remain in the ah, conformity stage is ah, one of denial, denial of their racial cultural heritage, denial that they are different uhm, and ah, an attempt to mold in ah, and fit in to White society. The denial uhm, mechanism is often seen in a number of self-statements that are made, "I'm not like them, I'm different. I've made it on my own. I'm the exception." These are attempts to distance yourself from ah, ah, one's racial ethnic group in order to make yourself more acceptable into the larger uhm, ah, society. So this is what I want you to think about, uhm, and I'm going to be going over all of these levels of consciousness before we begin to talk about, uhm, ah, therapeutic implications as you work with individuals who may uhm, reveal some of these particular characteristics. The second stage, and again before I go on, ah, there's much speculation about why one moves from one stage or one level of consciousness to another. Uhm, we really don't know. We speculate, and some of the speculation I'll share with you. They're based much more on clinical and experiential types of uhm, ah, a data than indeed empirical ones, that the second level of consciousness is one of dissonance, in which-

PHASE 2 - DISSONANCE Dominant-held views of minority strengths and weaknesses begin to be questioned. 

00:23:50
DERALD WING SUE - there is a breakdown of the denial system of the individual. And in essence this breakdown in the denial system occurs when the individual encounters information or experiences that are discordant with their previous beliefs that existed in the of, ah, conformity stage. Ah, there are essentially several ah, factors that might propel an individual out of the level of uhm, conformity consciousness into a feeling of conflict and indeed ah, dissonance in terms of their own, ah, racial identity. One of them, for example, is that, uhm, you encounter an individual that contradicts and shatters the stereotype that you have of individuals of your group. Let us for example uhm, ah, talk about the Nisei student. Her image of Asian-American men are that they are passive, unassertive uhm, ah, sexually emasculated, uhm, all of these negative stereotypes and she now encounters a Filipino male who tends to not conform to that ah, particulars of a stereotype. In fact she was quite shocked if you read this uhm, and read between the lines that he would actively stand up and object to being treated in a second-class manner by the waiter or waitress in getting poor service and indeed doing something about this. This is something that really shattered her image of, of, a masculine of, ah, you know, ah, masculinity that she associates certain low levels of masculinity with Asian American uhm, uhm, men. Ah, the other things that can happen, uhm, is something Bill Cross, ah, African-American psychologist who has done a lot of work in this, is that the individual can encounter a shattering event that breaks down the denial system. Many individuals colored, many African-Americans who might have been at the conformity stage of development, their, their idealized and, and their ah, self-de, deception that they were engaged in were shattered with in the event like the assassination of Martin Luther King. At the conformity stage, what a lot of individuals like to believe is that, uhm, discrimination, prejudice, racism doesn't exist anymore, and to see someone that you may admire uhm, ah, have such a, ah, a terrible ending begins to shatter and crumble the denial system that is going, uhm, ah, on. A third thing that can happen is that uhm, you begin to realize that no matter how Westernized you are, how much you tried to behave in a White Western way, certain doors in society remain closed to you. Uhm, and again the Nisei uhm, a student encountered that. It didn't matter that she prided herself and beli, uhm, uhm, and, and behaved in a way that, uhm, ah, that she would say would be idealized White behavior, when it came to service in a restaurant, she was indeed a second-class citizen again in terms of how of, a people behaved, ah, towards her. And the other thing, a fourth ah, element that begins to break down the denial system is to encounter people of your own group who have no shame, who in, ah, indeed seem very proud of being Asian or being Asian-American, and again this Filipino, uhm, a male student that ah, she encountered had none of this, this concern about ah, being ashamed. He was president of this Asian fraternity. He indeed exhibited that I have no shame. I'm proud to be Asian-American. Indeed the question that he probably would raise to her would be, "Why should anyone feel ashamed of being Asian, Asian-American, being Black, Black-American or, or so forth. So this is one thing that uhm, ah, begins to occur in the dissonance stage where one's self-deception begins to crumble and break, uhm, ah, down. At the dissonance stage, there is an increasing or growing sense of personal awareness that racism does exist. The self-deception engaged in is no longer affective. You do see racism ah, ah, going around you. You begin to realize that not all aspects of the minority or majority culture or good or bad and that you as an individual of racial cultural being, a person of color, cannot escape your cultural, ah, heritage. So the feelings of shame and pride are mixed in the individual, and if you go to the ah, case of the Nisei student, you will see, ah, ah, this mixture of being proud and being uhm, ah, you know, ambivalent and shameful of other aspects, and this characterizes strongly the dissonance stage where people are grappling with issues of self-identity. The third level of consciousness is what we call the resistance and immersion ah, consciousness stage. One becomes propelled into this particular uhm, uhm, ah, you know phase of, of development when the person begins to ask the question I just mentioned. "Why should I feel ashamed of who and what I am?" When that question begins to be asked, it is the time of searching for what has brought me to become ashamed of being African-American, Latino-Hispanic-American, Asian-American, Native American. What forces have created this negative, ah, ah, onslaught on, on me, and when the answer begins to come out that it is due to my cultural conditioning, the socialization of, ah, process and the person becomes aware of the social-psychological processes that result in prejudice and discrimination. Uhm, the resistance and immersion stage is effectively most characterized by feelings of anger, anger directed primarily at White society, White institutions, White culture and against cultural uhm, ah, op, oppression. There may indeed be almost a complete swing to the other end of the pendulum where the person rejects any or all things associated with being White or, ah, that is associated with White, ah, society. Members of the dominant group become, first, ah, you perceive them in a very suspicious way in which you do not trust that uhm, ah, individual. The minority individual at this stage is in, ah, interested in self-discovery all right, but it generally is much more related to one's own racial cultural group. Uhm, this was what happened in terms of what we called ah, in the, uhm, 1960's and early '70s when we had what was called the Third World Movement, ah, the Black Power Movement, the Chicano Power Movement, the Yellow Power Movement, all, the Red Power Movement, these were all group attempts to overthrow the negative cultural conditioning of one's group. And as the Nisei student journal uhm, ah, indicates, you know, uhm, ah, she suggested that she shouldn't even use the term "Oriental" because her Ethnic Studies teacher told her that was a negative, uhm, ah, term to use. In the past, you know, the reference that ethnically aware and conscious Asians used now uhm, is Asian-American Pacific Islanders. In the past during my father's time, it was "Oriental." Uhm, Oriental is a White definition of Asian identity. Ah, Asian Pacific American ah, labels tend to be group identity in which you define, you have the power to define who you are as opposed to letting other groups of, ah, define you. And I think that many of you know that the term Oriental if you associate with it, ah, the, the associations tend to be exotic, uhm, not passive, domestic, all, these are White definitions that many Asian Americans felt oppressed with. It is identical in the evolution of the names that we have ah, when we went from being, ah, colored, to being Negro, to being Black, to being ah, African-Americans where Black and African-American represents a group's attempt to self-define what they stand for rather than allowing a society to negatively define who they are and what they mean uhm, ah, in this way. Now cultural and racial characteristics that once you elicited feelings of shame and disgust that were present in the ah, conformity stage and also uhm, ah, at the ah, dissonance stage tend to now be seen as symbols of honor, uhm, a symbols of getting back in touch with one's roots, one's cultural of, ah, racial heritage. Terms like "black is beautiful" are indeed uhm, ah, phrases that speak to this particular uhm, issue, and there is a strong sense of spiritual connectedness and political connectedness with one's own group and occasionally with connections with other racial ethnic groups, ah, who have been oppressed ah, as well. It is very important to see this where at the conformity stage of development, there was this active uhm, ah, acceptance of Whites uhm, in a society and culture and it is almost like when you get to the resistance and immersion stage, the pendulum has swung completely to the opposite end where there is an active rejection of White society and White culture because there is this global feeling that it is White society that has, have oppressed and harmed and damaged, uhm, ah, individuals of color. So, that, ah, I want you to think about this as we begin to, uhm, ah, move to the other levels of, uhm, ah, levels of consciousness that is going on here. Individuals at this stage oftentimes experience high feelings of anger and hostility, and I say this and emphasize this strongly because it will have major implications when you work with individuals in a clinical situation and you are perceived as a symbol of that society and culture even if you are a therapist. It creates strange therapeutic dynamics that we will shortly, ah, ah, begin to address. Uhm, uhm, White individuals are often viewed with suspicion and mistrust because they represent, and if I can just simply say it, the oppressors, those who have harmed us, and as a result we cannot trust them because they represent "the enemies". And, I know I may be exaggerating it to the, ah, ah, extreme end but that is uhm, what I want us to look at as we begin to look at the other, ah, two other levels of, uhm, ah, levels of, of consciousness and awareness. Uhm, people will begin to move to what we have identified as the introspective, ah, level of consciousness, uhm, when they begin to experience discomfort with one, with rigidity of group conformance. Now, the introspective stage is most characterized by allegiance, all right, to one's own racial ethnic group but a beginning feeling of the need for some degree of personal autonomy. Ah, in other words, what we have here is an individual who pri, is pride, ah, has pride for their uhm, own racial group, for example, uhm, an African-American feel strongly positive about their African-American group but at the same time, at some level, may disagree with some of the stands, or, uhm, ah, you know, issues that are taken by that particular group, And they are now beginning to wonder, "Is it, if I stand for something that is not dominantly accepted by my group, uhm, ah, does it make me a sell-out." We, as people of color oftentimes use that ah, statement by asking, "How Asian are you?" "How Black are you?" They're, they're in some way, group attempts to say that, " Prove to us you're still part of the group." Now, this is too rigid, too extreme, and individuals at the introspection, uhm, ah, stage tend to begin to think that personal autonomy and responsibility is also important, not the one of, of, of individualism, but that ah, speaking in favor of something that may not be acceptable ah, acceptable to one's group is not necessarily a rejection or feeling of negativism ah, towards that, ah, a particular group. So, the second, uhm, ah, aspect of why a, a person begins to move to the, ah, introspection stage is that, a sense that, in the resistance and emergent stage, uhm, ah, of development, all of most, all of the energy you have is focused against White society. There is very little energies left to explore yourself as a racial cultural be, being. Who am I as a member of the Sue family? What are my cultural values, the heritage, uhm, ah, that I have? And ah, these questions begin to occur as we begin to talk about the introspective of ah, stage of development. The conflict that the person has, uhm, ah, can be quite great in terms of, uhm, this issue I referred to earlier, of responsibility, personal responsibility and at the same time allegiance, uhm, ah, to the group. And I want you to think really about it. This is a period of time at the introspective, uhm, ah, stage where the individual is really doing a self-exploration, not only of themselves personally, but asking the question, "What does it mean to be an Asian-American?" "What does it mean to be an African-American? A Latino-Hispanic- ah, American? What does it mean, ah, in terms of the integration of, uhm, ah, both being Asian and being American in, in terms of a cultural values?" And when this begins to develop to a strong enough, uhm, area, we enter into what I call, the integrative awareness level of consciousness. This is a last stage of, of development, in which an individual is beginning to come to the realization that extremes of either is not profitable, uhm, oh, no, not, you, you know, not good for them in terms of their identity of, ah, development. In the integrative awareness stage, much of the conflicts that occurred during dissonance, uhm, resistance and immersion, and yeah, even in the introspection stage, begins to become settled where the person begins to develop an inner sense of security as the conflicts between the new and old identities become resolved and become integrated in this sense. The global anti-White feelings of the ah, immersion and resistance stage subside as a person begins to realize and become more flexible, tolerant and multicultural or bicultural in their out, outlook and behavior. White and minority cultures are not seen as necessarily conflictual, however, what the person begins to distinguish and differentiate is that they are able to own and accept those aspects of U.S. culture that are seen as healthy and oppose those that are toxic, such as racism and oppression in terms of the functioning, ah, of the individual. At the integrative awareness stage, the person develops a positive self-image and experiences a strong sense of self-worth and confidence. Not only is there an integrated self concept that involves, uhm, ah, racial pride in identity and culture, but the person develops a high sense of autonomy, almost like uhm, ah, a gyroscope that keeps them ah, on track. They become bicultural or multicultural without a sense of having sold out one's sense of integrity. And it is this sense of integrity that is constantly assailed and/or worked upon throughout the other levels of consciousness that we've talked about. In other words, the person begins to pely, ah, perceive their identity ah, as composed of three levels. One of them is at the individual level, that they are quite unique. The second one is at the group level, where they, uhm, ah, were, were, were talking about the individual sharing characteristics with race, culture ethnicity, etc. And, the third level, being that of the universal, ah, ah, level, of existence where, indeed, all groups, Red, White, Black, Brown, Yellow share commonalities by virtue of this universal level of identity. Now, what I like to do is talk briefly about the implications that this brief review of the racial cultural identity development, uhm, ah, levels of consciousness have that may give us some idea of what it means for all of us, as counselors and helping professionals who work with clients of color, who may be at showing characteristics of these various, uhm, ah, categories that I've talked about. Let's first of all, talk about the conformity consciousness stage and the implications. If indeed you were to work with these Nisei student, if indeed you were to work with an African-American client for example, at the conformity stage, or a Latino client at the conformity stage, what are some of the things that you, in your assessment and therapeutic implic, uhm, ah, interventions might begin to think about. Now, let me correct, quickly say that the vast majority of clients who evidenced characteristics of the conformity consciousness level tend to believe in the superiority of White Western ways over their own racial cultural group. Now, if you think about it, ask yourself, what would, how would a client, a client of color at this particular level of consciousness respond to you? First of all, persons of color at this stage are most likely, uhm, to, to prefer a White therapist over a minority therapist. Why? That is because, uhm, they have been raised throughout their lives to accept the fact that White individuals are more confident and capable. And as a result, they tend to seek out, uhm, ah, ah, ah, White therapists or counselors, or feel much more, uhm, ah, co, you know, confident in that. Indeed, if they were, ah, if you are a minority or a, uhm, a counselor, ah, of color, there may be even a negative reaction towards you in one way or another, and this has happened to me when I was, ah, at the University of California, uhm, ah, Berkeley Counseling Center, many Asian students, and I now realize, that were at this conformity stage, seemed to have negative feelings when they were assigned to me, as a coun, uhm, ah, at, ah, as clients. They had these negative reactions, and it took a long time for me to explore with them the meaning of this before it was understandable to me about what was going on, uhm, in, in their head. They tend to react towards uhm, a minority therapist with negativism, resistance, and even open hostility, while their reactions towards White counselors or therapists might be ah, acceptance and even attempt to appease their White therapists in terms of, of, ah, depending upon them for validation because of the, uhm, the conformity consciousness characteristics that uhm, we talked about. Second, uhm, most people at the conformity stage, most of the clients at the conformity stage will find ex, explorations of cultural identity, explorations of one's, ah, ah, feelings very threatening to them. They will tend to avoid, uhm, ah, issues that tap upon, ah, who they are as a racial cultural being because it would touch on feelings of low self-esteem, issues of racial self-hatred. It would mean that they have to work through, their denial of who they are as a racial cultural being, and begin to see precisely, ah, ah, what is going on here. So, those are two things that I want you to think about immediately, uhm, that how clients of color respond to you may indicate the level of consciousness of their own racial cultural identity and that ah, clients of color at the conformity, ah, levels may find great difficulty in identity explorations and in terms of dealing with feelings that ultimately is uhm, attach upon shame, racial self-hatred, etc., that they find very threatening to admit or to allow uhm, ah, to become, ah, conscious. Whether you are a White or a minority counselor, however, working with the conformity individual, the general goals, I believe, are the same. First of all, I believe seriously that there is a therapeutic, not only a therapeutic, but a, ah, ethical obligation to help clients sort out conflicts related to racial cultural identity through some process of re-education. And I'm not talking about brainwashing here. I'm talking about the responsibility of the counselor to use their clinical skills to tap in to what is, uhm, the client might be defending again because, your de, if unless you do that, you are dealing with an individual that will, throughout their lives be operating in a state of denial and unhappiness that will be manifested in a number of, ah, of ways, and again, I'm not, when I say, re-education, I'm thinking more of a psycho-educational, ah, approaches to allow them to have insight into how society has culturally conditioned them to ah, a mindset that denigrates their own group and that elevates another unjustly, unfairly, and how it will, forever, unless they break out of this, cause and create difficulties in their, uhm, ah, own functioning. Only in this manner will the, ah, client, I believe, be able to identify positive attempts to assimilate and acculturate and not to deny their own racial cultural, ah, heritage. This is a very important thing. A minority therapist, as I've said before, working with a conformity level, uhm, ah, individual is likely to encounter a great deal of hostility, uhm, ah, when you are racially culturally similar to that, uhm, ah, individual. Now, what I think is very, uhm, ah, important, that if I am a counselor or therapist of color working with, let's say, the Nisei student has, ah, ah, come to me, what I am most, uhm, ah, that is most important for a counselor of color to do is to take a non-judgmental approach to the conflict of this, uhm, ah, student or this client. This client is wrestling uhm, with issues, they may not feel positively about, ah, you are their own race, you may get sucked in to, uhm, ah, being, uhm, ah, judgmental. Don't do it. Model the good role model as a, ah, a person of color how you handle these particular situations. Now, the opposite, it may be true for uhm, for a White therapist in which the ah, client of color will seek approval from you. In this case, the White therapist again, can use modeling uhm, by, in some sense, modeling how they perceive cultural diversity, racial differences as positive valuable attributes, ah, instead of allowing the, ah, individual at the conformity stage to continue the self-deception that, uhm, there is, ah, positive things only with whiteness and negative things only with their, uhm, ah, individual of color. In other words, most, the, uhm, a therapist of color and the, ah, White therapist cannot allow themselves to get sucked in to this dynamic that is going on. And, unless you understand what is going on, on the social political sense, with the conformity level awareness and consciousness, I think that is one of the areas. Then, let's now move to the second level of consciousness. Okay, the dissonance stage represent a stage that we de, described earlier, and, it is, that the individual becomes aware of the inconsistencies between dominant held views ah, and those of their group, and a sense of dissonance or inconsistencies begin to occur. Now, you might wanna review some of these ah, characteristics, uhm, ah, later, but in essence, there is at this phase or level of consciousness development, a concern with, ah, self-exploration identity issues uhm, and dealing with that, uhm, area of therapeutic ah, exploration. Most clients at this particular, uhm, ah, level of development tend to consider a counselor or therapist as being credible if they, in some sense, have two feet in both worlds, to, in their ability to understand what might be going on. They have to understand White Western ways and the ways of the ver, of person of a racial cultural uhm, ah, minority group so that the helping professional who tends to be able to span both of these world views and worlds are, uhm, in, indeed, ah, preferred in terms of, the, working ah, together. Dealing with conflicting feelings is the characteristic of this stage, and this is where the counselor or therapist has to follow the client very carefully. It is really the third uhm, ah, level of consciousness that we go to (coughs) at the present time that I described (clears throat) earlier, that deals with the resistance and immersion stage of development. As you recall, minority individuals, ah, or persons of color at this ah, ah, stage tend to view their psychological problems as products of oppression and discrimination. Here is where there is a number of factors and perhaps creates the greatest difficulties for therapists to work with clients who evidence resistance and immergen, ah, you know, immersion consciousness levels. It is because clients at this stage are most likely to challenge you. To test you out, because, in essence, if we think about this logically from the characteristics of this stage, the belief is that a global negative feeling of White America and White Western uhm, ah, ways. Therefore, ah, if you are a White therapist, there is a great deal of suspiciousness and of responding to you as an oppressor, someone who cannot, uhm, ah, be trusted. You are perceived as an enemy. Indeed, the most extreme form where clients might be at this uhm, ah, level of consciousness would not even seek counseling and therapy or many, uhm, uhm, mental health ah, services because these institutions are perceived as agents of this establishment that represent the oppression of, of, ah, of groups of colors, and so, that they will not come in. But what will happen, generally, with clients who begin to uhm, ah, work, let's say, with a, with a White therapist is this constant testing. How open are you? How honest are you? Are you racist and biased? Will you, ah, harm me? Are you stereotyping me? And the testing really is aimed at your credibility in terms of whether you are ah, able to free yourself from the biases in working, uhm, ah, with the individual. Now, individuals at this stage, uhm, if you are a counselor, White counselor, working with a resistance and immersion, uhm, ah, client, it is very important that you do not become defensive because a client is likely to react towards you in a symbolic, uhm, ah, fashion. They will talk about oppression, discrimination, how Whites have injured them, and they may even inquire as to your role, uhm, whether you are a racist or biased. Now, this anger that is directed globally at oppression and White society, indeed, is something that, uhm, you cannot get sucked into, to, can become personalized and become defensive. Once you do that, you have lost the ability to guide and aid this, uhm, ah, client in understanding their own racial cultural, uhm, you know, development and, ah, identity. The other thing I do want to say is that simply, you might think that individuals at the resistance and immersion stage may prefer therapist of color over White therapist, and, in general, that may be so, but being a therapist of color doesn't necessarily immunize you from the suspiciousness that may occur. For example, if you are a Black counselor and you're working with a Black ah, client, that client might come in and negatively react to you because you are perceived as a sell-out; that is, that uhm, ah, in some sense, how can you possibly work with an institution or ah, organization that is part of the pro, oppressive network of this culture and ah, society. And, ah, you might even be perceived as an Uncle Tom. So, I want you to know that, uhm, ah, that many of these challenges will begin to occur and that you as a counselor, whether you are White, Black, Asian, or so forth need to not become defensive, but to see the justified anger that this person ah, may direct towards you. And, there are a lot of, uhm, issues, and I think, that you ought to think about that, become, ah, very important, that may reflect characteristics, uhm, ah, of this, uhm, ah, level of awareness. For example, you may become questioned as to whether, ah, the test instruments, assessment instruments that you are using are culturally biased, you may be tested in terms of asking whether counseling and psychotherapy is meant to adjust, uhm, ah, people of color back to a sick society. Until you have these thoughts clear in your mind as to the implication and meaning, and that you are well-grounded, you will not be effective in dealing with the many challenges that are likely to ah, occur in terms of, of, ah, effective multicultural counseling. The other thing I do want to say to you is that the testing that you are likely to receive can be very ah, subtle or extremely overt. The overt one might be, "What do you care about Black people? You know, what do you know about Black people?" And, you know, these types of testing, depending how you answer it will either enhance or negate your credibility, or questions may be, ah, "Haven't, haven't mental health services oppressed people of color?" Unless you are able to deal with that question in an honest and genuine fashion, you may not be able to work effectively with clients who are at the, uhm, ah, resistance and immersion stage. The other, uhm, ah, level of consciousness is what I call the introspective, uhm, ah, stage. Cli, ah, clients at this stage, as I've indicated before, may continue to prefer a therapist of their own race, but they, in essence, are receptive to working with therapists of other cultures as long as they are able to understand and relate to their world view. So, increasingly, race becomes less of an important factor in the selection of a helping professional but the issue is, do you understand my worldview. Can you relate to it? Can you see it without pathologizing it? So exercising uhm, ah, your ability to deal with clients on, on these major questions are very, ah, important. The other stage, uhm, or level of awareness that we can talk about is the integrative awareness stage, that, uhm, we believe, represents, uhm, actually an ideal stage that we would like to strive towards. This is a stage in which clients have developed this inner sense of security and self-identity. Uhm, they have pride in their own racial, cultural heritage, but they can exercise a great deal of personal autonomy and freedom in determining their own identity and the direction that they wi, will go towards. Other cultures and racial groups are seen positively appreciated, and this individual is able to relate to any number of different individuals. And, again, it is not a matter of the ah, color or race of the therapist that is important to this client. It is much more, "Can this, ah, person understand and appreciate my bicultural and multicultural uhm, ah, identity?" Now, all(ph) I've gone very quickly in terms of describing the implications, therapeutically, uhm, ah, of this variate characteristics, but I really want to add some major cautions as we come to the end of today's, ah, ah, session. These cautions deal with all racial cultural identity development models. Uhm, the model that I'm talking about, the RCID, Racial Cultural Identity Development Model, as I've indicated, is a descriptive model. And, I want you to, uhm, in, in some sense, see all models of identity development, not as global personality theories with distinct identifiable stages. I use the term stages, pha, uhm, ah, phases, uhm, levels of consciousness. They are not fixed and, ah, distinct and identifiable. The culture, the process of cultural identity development is dynamic. It is not static and it is ongoing. Uhm, uhm, that is not even when you work with clients of color at, ah, these stages, it is an ongoing process that, that is occurring to them. One of the major dangers in seeing developmental models as fixed entities is, in uhm, ah, it is probably, that you will begin to stereotype and not really see the true person that you were, uhm, ah, working with. In actuality, the model should be used as a conceptual framework to help you understand the developmental process that people of color are going through. Secondly, I don't want you to fall into, ah, being a victim of stereotyping by using these models. You know, at the beginning, uhm, you know, I, I caution individuals, ah, all of you about, can only Blacks counsel Blacks? Whites, Whites? Asians, uhm, ah, Asians? Likewise, I don't want you to begin to say, "Oh, this conformity individual, that's the way they are." Uhm, that, that is not necessarily true because what we have here is that we represent a mixture of different traits and qualities that may be coming out from any number of those levels of consciousness, uhm, ah, that, that is going on. Another, uhm, ah, major area I want you to question and think about is that we have been presenting, uhm, this RCID model, ah, in a linear fashion. That is that we talked about conformity, dissonance, uhm, ah, resistance and immersion, introspection, integrative awareness. What I, what a number of people are saying is that, is this a linear process? Isn't it more, is, ah, a cyclical process, and, uhm, do you have to move from one, uhm, ah, level of awareness to another one, or can you skip them, can you start at a different area? Any number of these issues must be resolved in some way through research and, uhm, ah, further study, and, uhm, ah, understanding. Another area that uhm, ah, you should think about is that racial cultural identity development models deal with people who are born and raised in the United States. It is clear to me in my work with, uhm, ah, international students, uhm, you know, in, in education, that most people who immigrate as an adult to the United States have already an intact identity. As a result, ah, you, you have to ask the question, "How applicable is this particular model to people who immigrate to the, ah, United States who are not born and raised here, who were born overseas." This is one of the, uhm, ah, primary cautions I want to give all of you, that indeed it may not be applicable to recent immigrants, ah, who have come into this country. However, I guess I would say this, that the model may become applicable to offsprings who are born and raised, so despite the fact that you are a, ah, ah, recent immigrant, the person who has children, sons and daughters, born and raised in the United States, I believe, will go through this particular dynamic that we, uhm, ah, are talking about, ah, ah, today. Ah, the other thing I wanna say is be careful of the implied value judgments given in almost all development models. Uhm, I know that if you look at the RCID model, I own up to the fact that I do consider the integrative awareness uhm, ah, end goal as more desirable than perhaps others. Now, we can ah, debate this and take issue with it and in essence, however, I have come to the realization through many of my other colleagues who have done research in this field. There are positive qualities of each level of uhm, ah, ah, consciousness development. And looking at those positive qualities become, ah, very important. For example, while I talk about the, uhm, ah, the resistance and immersion stage as having global anti-White feelings, a great deal of anger and hostility, that anger and hostility is legitimate when directed towards oppressive and racist ah, ah, forces that are affecting the quality of life, of, of individuals, so that each and every one of us have to see both positive aspects of these levels of consciousness, ah, as well as potential downsides of them ah, as well. Ah, another major area that I, ah, we're beginning to look at much more, cli, ah, closely is Racial Cultural Identity Development models seriously lack an adequate integration of gender, class, sexual orientation and so, other socio-demographic factors in, in, incorporating them into the model. And, as we begin to look at it, it becomes very important for us to begin to think about that we're more than racial cultural beings. We are also gendered beings, ah, and, and so on as well. Another thing is that, uhm, look closely at understanding that racial cultural development can occur differentially, uhm. This is difficult to explain, you know, if you assume that all of us are Co, ah, all of us are spiritual beings, affective beings, behaving beings, uhm, cognitive or thinking beings. Is it possible that through this development, the, various aspects of our, uhm, ah, dimensions grow differently. For example, uhm, does affective development, behavioral development, cognitive or intellectual development occur at the same pace? Is it possible for me to be affectively at the resistance and immersion ah, stage, but cognitively and intellectually at the, let's say introspective or integrative awareness stage. Is it possible for me to behaviorally be at one stage of development but cognitively ah, at another? I think that this is something again that research will need to be ah, addressing, but intuitively, I think it's quite clear that we are all aspects of our total functioning, does not move uhm, ah, consistently in this manner. So, what I want you to uhm, to think about is that, uhm, that when you do your study and reading, understanding racial cultural identity development, is crucial and key to your development as an effective, multicultural uhm, ah, counselor. And as a result, uhm, it is not simply understanding the client of colors, racial cultural identity development. It is that you are also a racial cultural being as a therapist, as a counselor, is it, how, where are you in terms of your racial cultural awareness, and I can honestly say, uhm, ah, something, that, uhm, ah, we aren't, when you begin to talk of, we used to talk about cross-racial dyads. But let's say that what would it look like if you were a therapist that were at the conformity level of consciousness but that you were working with a client, ah, whether that client is of the same race as you were not, that that client is at the resistance and immersion stage. Now, I'm not going to answer that, this might be something for you to uhm, ah, discuss because now you begin to see the complexity of understanding racial cultural identity. If you are a counselor or therapist at the conformity stage and you work with the client at the resistance, immersion stage, even if of the same race, that interaction would, uhm, ah, be affected by the racial cultural identity development of both individuals. And next time when we ah, ah, talk about White racial identity, uhm, ah, development, we feel another major factor into this, but uhm, thank you very much and I hope to see you shortly.
