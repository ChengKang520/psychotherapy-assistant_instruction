00:01:00
PATRICIA All right. Where are they, Jack? 

00:01:00
JACK (inaudible ), your keys. 

00:01:05
PATRICIA All right, when they are lost they are my keys. 

00:01:05
JACK Ah… Here we go again. 

00:01:10
PATRICIA Some… dry washing(ph) this morning? 

00:01:10
JACK Yeah. 

00:01:15
PATRICIA Yeah, like 8:30. 

00:01:15
JACK Well… 

00:01:15
PATRICIA Oh, it's… it's 20 after 8. 

00:01:15
JACK No kidding really. 

00:01:20
PATRICIA Oh fine. Look, all I'm saying is… 

00:01:25
JACK Oh, I know exactly what you're saying, Pat. Believe me I know exactly what you're saying. 

00:01:25
PATRICIA Well, I am not getting any response. 

00:01:25
JACK Good for me. 

00:01:30
[sil.] 

00:01:35
PATRICIA I swear, most of the time you're complaining about not getting enough work and then when you finally do get something, you screw around here, all morning instead of getting your work. 

00:01:45
JACK Ah… so what? Hey you know about my business, uh? Is that it? I guess you are happy, just sitting around, you run everybody's life for you. Now you wanna run mine. Is that it, Pat? Is that it? 

00:01:50
PATRICIA Ah… please. 

00:01:55
JACK Yeah, right exactly. 

00:01:55
PATRICIA Ah… 

00:02:00
[sil.] 

00:02:40
PATRICIA You think this is so easy, Jack, doing my job all day and then kind of back here and look after you too, and then on top of all that, I got to put up with this scrap? 

00:02:50
JACK Then quit. 

00:02:50
PATRICIA All right, I’ll just quit. After all that’s what you do, isn’t it? You just get tired of working or something and then you just quit. All right. Why didn’t I think of that? 

00:03:00
JACK It’s because you enjoy sitting around being miserable all day, don’t you, Patricia? 

00:03:05
PATRICIA No, that's not why Jack. It’s because I'm responsible and you're not. It’s because I always put myself last in this family and you always, always put yourself first. That’s why. 

00:03:15
JACK Yeah, like I said, quit. 

00:03:15
PATRICIA Quit. Quit what? 

00:03:15
JACK Oh I guess that's for you to figure out, isn’t it? 

00:03:25

00:06:25
JENNY So you cut. 

00:06:25
DANNY Yeah I cut. Look, can we go there and talk? 

00:06:30
JENNY Yeah. 

00:06:35
DANNY Okay. Well, I was (inaudible ) on my thinking. 

00:06:40
JENNY Me too. 

00:06:40
DANNY Really? 

00:06:40
JENNY Yes. 

00:06:40
DANNY And then what? 

00:06:45
JENNY You first. 

00:06:45
DANNY Okay. Um… well, I was thinking that… 

00:06:50
JENNY Dan, (inaudible ) do you have class today so… 

00:06:55
DANNY Well I think we need a break. 

00:06:55
JENNY Really? 

00:07:00
DANNY Yeah. I mean like I said, I was up on and thinking and I didn’t just want to call you, you know. 

00:07:05
JENNY Oh no, this is much more considerate, dump me before period(ph) Thanks. 

00:07:10
DANNY Jen (inaudible ). Look, I… I can't even talk to you anymore, you know that. It’s like you're… you're some whole other person or something. 

00:07:20
JENNY Of course. 

00:07:20
DANNY You are. 

00:07:20
JENNY You know I'd… I wouldn’t wanted to be talking to strangers or anything, Dan, so… 

00:07:25
DANNY Jen, please stop and try not to make a scene here. I am saying that… that the girl I fell totally in love is (inaudible ) here, it’s like she’s gone. She’s dead Jen. 

00:07:35
JENNY Oh yeah. 

00:07:35
DANNY I am serious. It’s like being in mourning over here something. 

00:07:40
JENNY Somehow(ph). 

00:07:40
DANNY Jen, I will give you a call after school. 

00:07:45
JENNY Don’t bother. 

00:07:45
DANNY All I am saying is that I wish that we could do… 

00:07:50
JENNY (inaudible ) your wish for Dan, you just might get it. 

00:07:51
MS. TANNER Okay. Let’s take a look at the romantic poets. The romantic poets were more than a little bit into suffering, okay? Most of the guys, and they were mostly guys, believe that there was a sign of superiority if they walked around feeling depressed, (inaudible ) all the time. They believed or viewed this life as some great big tragedy where they were here to suffer, feel this tragedy kind of like God’s big mistake and they were here to feel God’s pain. On the other hand though, these same people believed that the next one, the afterlife is gonna be wonderful like a paradise. It’s kind of interesting that the same guy who created this wonderful paradise, also put them in this life of tragedy and suffering that they couldn't wait to escape from. So you can see why the romantics were fascinated and in love with death. 

00:08:55
JENNY And so you are saying as these guys are just a big bunch of losers? 

00:09:00
MS. TANNER No, no that’s not what I am saying. No, the people like (inaudible [00:09:04), the romantics, okay, they were capable of feeling really-really deeply about things and that’s… that’s kind of a gift, a sacred thing, but it’s also something that demands an appropriate response. 

00:09:20
PATRICIA No, I’m not coming in today. I already told Tracy. Why? Because my daughter maybe coming down with something, yeah. And I think it might be something pretty serious. 

00:09:30
JENNY (inaudible ) you don’t have to call. 

00:09:35
Yeah, but you got to go to the attendance office and she has to sign you up from there. 

00:09:35
JENNY Okay. 

00:09:35
Can you wait there for me? 

00:09:35
JENNY Hmm… Hmm… 

00:09:40
Alright. Hope you feel better Jenny. 

00:09:40
JENNY Thank you. 

00:09:40
Bye-bye.

00:13:50
JENNY Doing what? We come here all the time. 

00:13:55
TANYA Not with these, we don’t. 

00:13:55
JENNY Hey, it’s a big freaking deal Tanya, it’s a little high once in a while. 

00:13:55
TANYA Don’t you dare trying to play me Jen. Don’t you dare? I lost a brother this way, remember? 

00:14:00
JENNY It’s not like that.

00:14:18
JENNY Do you? Do you really? Do you know what it’s like to sit in your room, balling your eyes at every single day, and… and you don’t even know why? Do you know it’s like they put on the show for you, for Dan’s and my parents because… because I’m too embarrassed (inaudible ) know about, how freak I’m. 

00:14:35
TANYA Jen, you’re not a freak. You’re not a freak and neither (inaudible ). 

00:14:41
JENNY Look, I don’t wanna feel this right. Really, I don’t. 

00:14:45
TANYA How long has it been Jen? 

00:14:50
JENNY Six months. 

00:14:50
TANYA God, I can’t believe I didn’t see anything. 

00:14:55
JENNY You weren’t supposed to. No one was. I mean, that would be easy enough to hide from my parents though he’s… to be just screaming each other as it is, but then it all turned into… what’s your problem anymore Jenny, I mean what’s wrong with you Jenny and… and I just like screaming… I don’t know what my problem is, alright? I… I don’t know why I don’t wanna see anybody or why don’t wanna do anything anymore, why I’m so speaking miserable all the time? But then… then it’s like why am I wondering here, you know? I mean people are picking flies or some baby and some starving third world country and… and I’m over here crying and for what? 

00:15:30
TANYA You don’t know. 

00:15:35
JENNY That’s right. I don’t know. 

00:15:40
TANYA Yeah. Neither did (inaudible ). You know, but nobody else knew that. Except for me. 

00:15:50
JENNY What are you talking about? 

00:15:50
TANYA He told me Jen. Same as you’re doing now, but I just told him… I told him to get over it, you know? You know, he was always real dramatic about things, he always saying stuff like, a lot I thing I can get through this one Tan, you know, but he would. Whatever it was, whatever happened, he would always get through it. Uh… So, I guess that’s why when he told me that he’d… he’d better off get something like that I just… I just laughed, you know. I just laughed and I… and I blew him off because I… I just figured that it’s just another bad episode of a… (inaudible ) show and never rerun, you know. It’s something that I had seen before. But I… I, but I hadn’t. He always said that he was always looking for reasons why he felt so bad, but I just didn’t know. 

00:16:45
JENNY I’m always looking for reasons too Tan, but I never find them. I never find them. 

00:16:55
TANYA Then… let’s just… let’s look for them together, okay? 

00:17:05
[sil.] 

00:17:10
TANYA Everything is gonna be okay. 

00:17:10
JENNY Yeah? 

00:17:10
TANYA Yes. Really, yes. 

00:17:20
[sil.] 

00:17:35
PATRICIA What happened? Where have you been? 

00:17:35
JACK I just got over Tanya is looking for and… Oh, thank god. Where have you been? 

00:17:40
JENNY Um… I just… 

00:17:50
[sil.] 

00:17:55
JENNY I got lost. 

00:18:00
According to the World Health Organization, major depression is the single greatest cause of disability in the world… …causing more long-term human misery than any other single disease. 

00:18:15
KELLY HAILEY Teenage depression often goes undiagnosed. Parents, teachers even friends might view a depressed teen as, someone in need of an attitude adjustment or someone just going through a phase. But they would be wrong because when the teenagers bad mood lasts for more than a few weeks, and they no longer seem like themselves, there’s a good chance that they could be experiencing clinical depression, a condition that, if left untreated can cause devastating health effects and can destroy lives. Like Jenny, many who suffer from clinical depression don’t even know why they feel so bad; never realizing that they may just have a biological predisposition to depression, and much of the same way that others have a similar predisposition to a heart disease or some other illness. And yes, depression is an illness. Not some tragic character flaw and like any other illness it needs to be treated by a doctor, otherwise it will only get worse. So in watching Jenny, if you recognize yourself or someone close to you talk to someone. A school counselor or a parent, a friend, talk to someone and do it today because you know what? You can’t afford to lead.
