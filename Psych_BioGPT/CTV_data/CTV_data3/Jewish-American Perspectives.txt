ISSUES IN MULTICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT A Microtraining Series Reflecting on Life Experience: Using Erikson's Model in the Interview Jewish-American Perspective Norma Block Gluckstern interviewed by Allen E. Ivey This tape demonstrates Erikson's theory used to help clients understand how their past relates to the present. This tape is not therapy, but reflecting on life experience can be therapeutic. 

00:00:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Erik Erikson's developmental theory is a critical part of any counselor or psychotherapist's understanding. In this tape, we'd like to review his theory but with some new modifications for the clinical practice in the interview. What do I mean by clinical practice in interview? Well, we really believe that a life review based on Erikson's framework and modified by more multicultural and gender understanding can be really helpful in gaining a broad background of how your client comes to think and feel and act as he or she does. So, in effect we see this is a very practical application of Eriksonian developmental theory. Now, in this tape, we're going to interview Dr. Norma Gluckstern and in this process we're gonna be reviewing various life stages. You find this a fascinating tape. Well, see the person who is the first generation dollar immigrant parents and ended up being the warden, the first woman warden of a male prison in United States, a major male prison in United States. What happens to a person through lifespan development, I think will be well illustrated while it's, I think this fascinating person as, and we review the life stages and see how each stage led to where she is now. I'd like, particularly, to mention the work of Koji Tamase. Ah, Koji is a colleague at Nara University in Japan and we worked together applying developmental counseling and psychotherapy, DCT, to Eriksonian lifespan development. Koji has really pointed out very well that in different cultural situations, people develop very differently. They tell different stories, different issues are important to them. For example, issues of autonomy, which is so important in individuation in Eriksonian theory. Play themselves off very differently. For example, in Japanese culture, which we take here about issues on how people are connected as equally or perhaps even more important than individuation and finding your own space. So as part of this interview process, we'll be influenced by Koji Tamase and the DCT model. And I will begin each segment by looking at the social-historical context, ah, in which Norma Gluckstern presents the developmental stage. In effect, you find a common question, what is going on in the family- 

00:02:50
Development in family and social-historical context 

00:02:50
ALLEN E. IVEY - and sometimes in a broader, social, contextual situation in society, as you go through each stage of development. Finally, I do wanna say that there are handouts to go with this and we really hope that you will not just watch this tape but take the handouts and exercises, and go out and interview a, a client or interview your, another classmate or a workshop participant. So, you can start looking at how lifespan development affects individual in the here and now. 

00:03:20
Introducing Norma Block Gluckstern 

00:03:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, Norma, as we start, ah, I guess I'd like to ask ah, how you feel about being here and we're doing, be, being on tape once again and actually doing a life review. Ah, ah, where are you at this moment? 

00:03:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Oh, Norma's smiling. It's, it's interesting because we certainly have lived a lifespan- (crosstalk) 

00:03:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:03:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - in terms when the microtraining started. And, ah, it's almost like I'm going through a transition now. (crosstalk) 

00:03:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:03:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN This is the, I want to see the framework 'coz I think there are series of transitions. But this is very important, ah, and, and it's caused me to sort of reflect a little bit on and what the last- (crosstalk) 

00:04:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:04:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - few years had been liked for me. (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:04:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And, uhm, the one thing, I, I guess, the thing I thought about, I was reading Gail Sheehy and, and she describes something an, an analogy, ah, analogy between what happens with transition is it's like a lobster. And as a lobster begins to shed every time it goes to transition, it sheds its shell. And during that period that the shell is being shed- (crosstalk) 

00:04:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:04:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and new one's growing, they're very vulnerable. (crosstalk) 

00:04:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:04:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  And you have to in either grow or something, or, or you, or you're destroyed. And, and I sort to feel it as I, as I were reflecting on that and as I was thinking about today, a shell, another shell has come off. (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:04:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And I'm going through a period of the last few, uhm, the last couple of years having my shell come back on because I worked very vulnerable at this time 'coz I change- (crosstalk) 

00:04:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:04:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - careers. And so, this caught me very interesting for me as- (crosstalk) 

00:04:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:04:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - I reflect back in more, but a big more introspective, ah, in terms of my life space. 

00:04:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  Great. Ah, I think that's a wonderful metaphor, the, the shedding and the moving through transitions and keeping the old but becoming new. (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  Uh hmm. 

00:05:10
ALLEN E. IVEY That's a great way to start. As a background, as I told you is that, ah, you seem to get very lengthy or, or undo this relatively briefly is that, ah, I'd like to hear, ah, a little bit about your family culture background. I do know that you're the first generation daughter immigrants and if you could tell me a little bit about each side. 

00:05:30
Development occurs in family, cultural and social-historical context. Segment Goals: 1. Rapport 2. Family 3. Positive image located physically in the body as resource 

00:05:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  My mother's family was from Russia,- (crosstalk) 

00:05:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:05:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and, ah, we did came to the states during that programs and, ah, ah, in Russia in the 1900's, and that was, there was a mass immigration of Jews to this country. And my father was from Latvia from, ah, Balkan States and came about the same time, he was older than my mother. And, uhm, they found their way. When I think about how they survived coming over here as immigrants and the way they outlived and, it's just remarkable what's happened to them, in particular, what they gave to their children 'coz I think that having neither my father nor my mother had, ah, any other further education than their basic high school that they had in Europe. Ah, it's just known to myself, my brother going out to college but this was not unique to us. This was you, part of, of, of this group of, of mass of Jews that came during that period the way they raised their children. (crosstalk) 

00:06:35
Stories provide concrete examples of developmental history 

00:06:35
ALLEN E. IVEY I wonder if you could, ah, maybe just say one story that, ah, either one of your parents told you that, ah, stands out from their, from their own life history. 

00:06:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I think probably with, with mother and that his, her mother died when she six and she was the youngest of five children and she really was brought by an older brother. And that, I think, left an empty shell for her. Ah, one that I don't think she really has recovered as I see her now in her 90's, ah, reflecting back on what her childhood and, and, and I often wonder whether having grown up like that. And, and we've talked so much about mothering and what parents should- (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - do. How did these people or how did she survive? (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN How did she know? How that you can be a mother? And, ah, I'm sort of hit with that very much as I reflect back on the kind- (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - of early life that they had compared to myself and to compare to my children. 

00:07:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. So the impact of, of the loss and your mother was kinda, it's a central metaphor that occurs to you. 

00:07:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN It's central metaphor because it also, I think, had an impact on how I was brought up. (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And, and, ah, how she want her expectations were for herself and for me. And I think that, that did impact and I think was,- (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - ah, much was attributed to the fact that she wants as younger child brought up by the, her older brothers and sisters. 

00:07:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. What about, ah, we go on, of course, at great length, do you have a brief story that occurs to you as a metaphor, central thought recollection of your father? 

00:08:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  My father was a very gentle man. He didn't fit into the stereotype of the Eastern-European. I think the thing I remember most about my father was that he was the gentler, kinder soul- (crosstalk) 

00:08:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:08:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - in our family and modifies with my mother's anger. And I think the thing I remember, and this was not at early childhood, but, ah, when I had my first child, ah, it was unusual for a fa-, grandfather at that period to change his son's diaper, and he would come and visit us, we lived in New Haven. And, ah, the two years that he got to know Steven and he, he was more nurturing and mother in any respects than my own mother, which- (crosstalk) 

00:08:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:08:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - at that time was unusual for males. 

00:08:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:08:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And so, I have a very, ah, very tender feelings about my father. 

00:08:50
ALLEN E. IVEY He's a very special father. 

00:08:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:08:50
ALLEN E. IVEY One thing that we like to do within DCT, ah, is anchor, ah, positive images in the body, ah, ah, as particularly as we start life review. If we work with more, could we just take, ah, can you get additional image of, ah, your father with your, your son, I mean, that, that gentle time? 

00:09:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I think that, he used to stop on the road, coming to visit us in New Haven and he'd always stopped at the fruit stands and, and- (crosstalk) 

00:09:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:09:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - he'd always come in with wonderful produce(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:09:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:09:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And, ah, I could see him over the basinet,- (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  Hmm. 

00:09:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - changing Steven's diaper and talking to him. And he wasn't well at the time 'coz he had a series of heart attacks,- (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Hmm. 

00:09:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and wanting so much to, to still reach out and hold him- (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:09:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and still have part of that,- (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:09:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - that, ah, uhm, a gentle dove. 

00:09:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. A gentle dove? 

00:09:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:09:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Wow. He's a very powerful image. Where, where did you get that gentle dove image in your. 

00:09:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN No, I was just sort of thinking, I, I never agree with form(ph) in terms of what you- (crosstalk) 

00:09:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-hah. 

00:09:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - had said a metaphor. And so, I just, that was something that I, ah, just maybe looking out here and seeing the forest and so forth. I thought of a gentle bird. 

00:10:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:10:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  And, uhm, I think what's coming through as I had a much deeper relationship with my father than I did with my mother and which caused a lot of conflict,- (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:10:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and, ah, in, in the family coz I've thought of my mother and, and, and it's very funny 'coz I felt of her as being a more assertive, the more demanding, ah, the more aggressive soul and the irony of the whole part is someone like my mother than my father (laughing). That's the irony of life. 

00:10:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh. 

00:10:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Though I think I have more of his sensitivity and I don't think I'm, ah, than I, than my, than my mother's. Ah, but I think I'm, just if you look at my, what I did through my life, you can see that I was much more assertive, shall we say, an aggressive woman. 

00:10:50
Placing positive developmental images in the body can serve as important resources for the future 

00:10:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Could you take that, ah, gentle dove, I mean, the image of your father? Can you locate that image, feeling in your body somewhere, anchored in your body? Do you feel that in your body somewhere? 

00:11:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I think I'm feeling it if I breathe, as I take in the air and sort of relax, I feel it in that kind of letting go of, of some of the tension that I feel. That's how I, that's how I felt my body. 

00:11:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. I can kind of see that particular (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:11:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yeah. And I think that's how I anchored. 

00:11:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. We often brought anchor in our body with these key images and I just wanted to, as we begin, just get- (crosstalk) 

00:11:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:11:30
ALLEN E. IVEY - just one, if you get several, that this, this feeling of breathe, by breathing and letting go. Ah, there are many more things we could do. We could do a family genogram or look at family history that, I think, maybe that might be enough- (crosstalk) 

00:11:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:11:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - for this particular phase. 

00:11:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN It's relaxed me. Yeah. 

00:11:45
Cultural Background Goal: To examine how culture issues in the family may be related to developmental history 

00:11:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Alright, as we get star ted, ah, as you know, I'd like to see the, the individual and fami ly context and family also as emblematic of the culture. So, could you tell me just a little bit about the cultural background of your mother and father and, ah, how they came to United States? 

00:12:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Well, mother and father were both Eastern-European Jews and they both came to this country during the programs in the 19, early 1900s. They were. 

00:12:20
ALLEN E. IVEY So they were forced out with perse-, persecution? 

00:12:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  Persecution. And, and they, they, you know, and that was, that when they tried to leave, ah, Europe at that time because, certainly, the United States of America offered the (inaudible ) and they offered an opportunity- (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:12:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - that nowhere else could o-, offer. So, they came over. My mother came over from Russia and she was one of five children. She was the youngest- (crosstalk) 

00:12:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:12:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - of, ah, two sons and two other daughters. My father came over from Latvia. And, and at that time really unusual, he was an only child. Ah, mother was brought up by her older brothers. When- (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - mother came to this country within six or seven years, her mother passed away. And I think her being brought up by her family, in particular, by her brother had their impact on her all through life. And it's been more noticeable now as she reflects on really, what was basically an unhappy childhood- (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - without any mothering. As we think of parenting and mothering now, she really didn't know what mothering meant- (crosstalk) 

00:13:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - was all about. 

00:13:25
ALLEN E. IVEY So, her loss kind of impact to both you and, and your family and even now, ah, she is 93, I think, I understand. 

00:13:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yes. 

00:13:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Is that right? I mean, could we go farther with that? We could, well, I think we'll come back to a little bit later in that, the rest of the tape but just tell me a little about your father. 

00:13:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Now, my father was an only child and he came over before just, he came over with his father- (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - just before World War II. His mother was caught in Europe and didn't get over until after World War II. So basically, my father was brought up by his father and the, and the immediate family there. (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:14:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Ah, I did not know my grandfather at all. My grandfather passed away before I was born or- (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:14:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - right after I was born. Ah, but my father who didn't really took interesting, probably didn't have the mothering, maybe he had a fathering or parenting because my father, I think, in many respects was the more nurturing, ah, two of my, of, of the family which again was unusual because you don't think of men in that period as being nurturing. And I think he was the more nurturing one. 

00:14:25
ALLEN E. IVEY So your father was a piece and he seems to represent a nurture. Could you get just the, one thing we like to do in the developmental model is to ask you to get an image of your father at a gentle time. 

00:14:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Well, I think once before I spoke, he reminded of the, of the gentle dove and- (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
ALLEN E. IVEY A gentle dove, uh hmm. 

00:14:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - carrying, soft me. (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
ALLEN E. IVEY It's, it's kind of the images as this metaphor. Could you get a visual image of that, ah, gentle dove of your Dad? 

00:14:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  Well, I think that when I try to, maybe, I never thought that before sort of what it would feel like, somehow, it's if I just take a deep breath and let my body go, I feel it's kind of relaxed flowing feeling and- (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - of contentment. 

00:15:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And that doesn't happen that often to me. (crosstalk) 

00:15:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN But as I talk about my father and, I tell myself, "Hey, relax," and, ah. 

00:15:20
ALLEN E. IVEY That's a wonderful feeling. (crosstalk) 

00:15:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:15:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  So almost anytime you choose to. Ah, one thing I like to say is that, ah, those positive ex-, positive experiences are always with us. And you have this image of the gentle dove and the breath, which gives you some, some comfort. 

00:15:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN It's interesting 'coz I don't think I'd ever thought about that one till we're just, we're talking now and just talking about him. Maybe just be relaxed. 

00:15:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Hmm. So we have some real strengths at the same time I've heard the conflicts and sometimes these conflicts from family play themselves out. (crosstalk) 

00:15:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:15:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And the next statement will take, take a look at that. Okay? 

00:16:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN It sounds good. 

00:16:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Thank you. 

00:16:00
Trust vs. Mistrust Goals: To find examples of these issues. To consider the social context of this developmental phrase. 

00:16:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Norma, as we start, ah, as you well know, Erikson's first stage is infancy where issues of trust versus mistrust- (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:16:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - are played out. And, ah, if I to sort of get a story from this particular stage but as, again, this background, ah, what do you know is going on between your parents and perhaps even in the context at that time? When I say context, I mean some times there's a depression or, ah, a boom or something like that, there may be something complete outside the family that (inaudible ) the family. So what was going on with your family at the time of your birth? 

00:16:46
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  Uhm, I, I don't know if I can really answer that 'coz we were not very good at sharing stories. Ah, ah, I grew up in a family where, family secrets and so you didn't really share much with your children and you didn't know much. But the thing that bring- 

00:17:05
Economics affect development 

00:17:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - that I most struck about is in growing up was that the, that there was the depression and that, that much of, of I can remember was tied up with the lack of money. (crosstalk) 

00:17:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN It was the inability to find a job with an enormous amount of insecurity. I think that was overwhelming in the family. 

00:17:25
ALLEN E. IVEY So Norma, ah, you were family, you were born with a really kind of, during the depression. (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Right. 

00:17:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And, and your family is experiencing some very challenging economic times. 

00:17:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN It's, certainly, the thing that, that, that I remember in my childhood and, and I have a facility. I don't know if maybe it would do. I'm just walking out but I don't want to remember. (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  And as, in fact, I have a very poor memory. I'm a bad subject in terms of talking about my childhood. (crosstalk) 

00:17:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN That is, much of my childhood is blank, whether it's by choice, or whether it's by fact that I just don't really have bad long-term memory. (crosstalk) 

00:17:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I think it is by choice but the things that hit me that I remember most is the fact that money, ah, you know, when mon-, when the, uhm, gasman came and turned off the gas 'coz it was- (crosstalk) 

00:18:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:18:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - my parents hadn't paid the bill. 

00:18:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. Now, that's kind of a little bit older. (crosstalk) 

00:18:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Right. 

00:18:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And we'd, we'd come to that, that issue money is about, I kinda got that but, I'm kinda looking here for that infancy- (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:18:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - in your early childhood- (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN All right. 

00:18:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - earliest recollections. (crosstalk) 

00:18:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Let, let me say, the earliest recollection is very much tied up with my mother and her sister and- (crosstalk) 

00:18:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - my cousin whose name is Norman. (crosstalk) 

00:18:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I've impact on my childhood was a cousin who was named Norman, in fact, I have two cousins, three cousins all named Norman and I was Norma. And my mother and my aunt, literally, lives, if not in the same house, side by side and that we're very much influenced by that relationship- (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:18:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - with my mother towards her, with her sister (crosstalk). 

00:18:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Ah, and her sister was a dominating figure. 

00:19:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Ah, and her son was a dominating figure and that sort of impact that would be very, where there were no boundaries. (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN If I, the best way to say is that there were no boundaries within my, ah, mother and her sister and between the families. (crosstalk) 

00:19:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  So that coupled with money or with the recollections I have of my early childhood. 

00:19:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:19:20
Birth stories often useful 

00:19:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Do you have a, your birth story at the, of your birth, ah? 

00:19:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  No. It's a, it's a interesting thing for me and, and- 

00:19:25
But only if they are recalled! 

00:19:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - I've tried. I mean, actually, I've gone to therapy and almost resist going back to my childhood. 

00:19:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Ah, ah. 

00:19:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Almost like you're resisting now. 

00:19:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:19:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:19:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN It is, it is, it's there and, and I don't know whether, you know, why that is- (crosstalk) 

00:19:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:19:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - but it's very difficult for me to have these early recollections. (crosstalk) 

00:19:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And if you asked, ah, I often talk to my husband through, throughout and he only recalled things with his childhood- (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and, and both pleasant and unpleasant- (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - but I can't remember any of those things. 

00:20:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Now, let's take this concept of trust versus mistrust, ah. 

00:20:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I think there was a lot of mistrust. 

00:20:05
Erikson's concepts more helpful 

00:20:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Mistrust. (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I don't think I, I, if, if one would say that I developed trust, I think that I would say that probably, that early stage- (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - it was that I never really did, ah, develop that sense of trust that maybe I should have at that early age. (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I think I have compensated for it. (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN But I don't think I really developed it. 

00:20:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  Could you tell me, ah, hopefully, as early as you can, a story where you get this feeling of mistrust? 

00:20:30
[sil.] 

00:20:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  A relationship, it's tied up very much in relationship with his cousin and we grew up almost his brother and sister that was just a year with age difference. (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  And I can remember, ah, being, ill, and I can remember being in a porch- (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and I can remember him pulling a chair from under me- (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and my, hitting my head and cracked it. (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And he's not being this one for in my being elder because I allowed it to happen. That's a memory. (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Ah, I don't have many- (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:21:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - I, I, I remember myself on a pony ones- (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and that was a pleasant memory. But most memories get tied up with un-, with not, oh, I can, another negative memory that I always. 

00:21:15
ALLEN E. IVEY You've never known that chair's gonna be pulled out. 

00:21:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I never know that, ah, silly, a type of silly one. Uhm, I, my mother had brought me and allowed to with a muff. (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN You know, the girls wear muffs? 

00:21:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I wanted that coat and that muff and for some reason, which I don't know, mother returned the coat and the muff and they never had my muff. (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:21:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And that's one of the few memories. I saw, I think my memories are more in, of not trusting- (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - than of trusting- (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - which is. 

00:21:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. I'm going to push you on that, ah, a little bit. I've got the non, not trusting. I've got that, for me, the metaphor kind of stands out the chair being pulled out- (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:21:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - from that (inaudible ) whether it's a loss of the muff or your cousin or some other situations, I wonder if you can you recall a situation. You did mention, ah, the gentle dove of your father. Do you have a feeling, perhaps with him, friends, community, do you have some feeling of safety in being ah, very. 

00:22:15
Recall Norma's earlier feelings of trust and relaxation with her father 

00:22:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  I'm trying to really reflect, there must have been some safety in my, there must have been some safety and there must have been some positives, but I really, I'm trying to search for one memory- 

00:22:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - that I have in which I can smile or, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - which, I mean, this is terrible. All right. (laughing) I almost feel- (crosstalk) 

00:22:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:22:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - of frustrate, I feel like I, I, I almost like I wanna give you a positive because I think- (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - I'm a positive person and I think- (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I've, and, and trust. (crosstalk) 

00:23:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I think what I did was because there was so lack of trust. I reverse myself and give people always the benefit of the doubt. (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And even when I moved professionally, it took me a long time before I, if there was an employee that I had that I felt wasn't doing the job, I would give them the maximum amount of space. So- (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And you felt you had it and you're giving all of that? (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - so I think that maybe that the, the reaction that is- (crosstalk) 

00:23:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - that I tend to give people more trust. (crosstalk) 

00:23:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

00:23:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And, and that that's almost sort of reverse reaction with the fact that I didn't have. And if, but I honestly- (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - can say to you, I can't remember. 

00:23:30
ALLEN E. IVEY I think a lot of people will have issues like this. I think this is really important to get out. So let's just stop for a minute and then we're gonna move on to the next phase. Thanks, Norma. 

00:23:40
Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt Goals: To examine these issues and to consider the social/family context at that life phase 

00:23:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Norma, the next phase, phase which is supposed to be associated in early childhood between two and four. I think you've already illustrated that Erikson's basic issues may be rooted in early childhood experience but they do occur, play themselves again at different ages. (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:24:05
ALLEN E. IVEY I mean, let's just modify this a little bit. Ah, the second task, it talks about all these concept development of autonomy versus shame and doubt. And, ah, that speaks to the early childhood period of two and four. And, ah, I would guess that the family situation, ah, you'd be then two to four years old, what was going on anything particularly going out in your family in that age period that you can think as you've mentioned the depression and anything else you might add to that as they move along a little older. 

00:24:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  Uhm, I'm just trying to think 'coz I think autonomy was something that I did get, I mean, I think it's somehow I was, and, and maybe I'm not sure what was going on but I think in sense of, of, ah, autonomy was or being able to be self-sufficient, ah, was, was imparted and I'm not exactly sure why. I do know that, uhm, there was a time where because of the financial situation, my mother and her, it's my mother's family and my, my aunt's family, we all lived together, and my mother became the caretaker for the children- (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - which was myself and my brother and my Norman and his sister. (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:25:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN My aunt went to work and maybe that was a period in which there were so many children that she was taking care of that we didn't become independent- (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and self-sufficient. I'm not sure if whether that is relevant but I, that certainly was an important aspect. 

00:25:35
ALLEN E. IVEY So, being independent and self-sufficient was really kind of a- (crosstalk) 

00:25:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And that's, it was of necessary, it was necessary in the environment when I was growing up to be so, and it, and it became more so as we get in to the later stages- (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - where I really do take on major responsibilities. 

00:25:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. And I know you've always been proud of your ability to go against the string and be attached. 

00:25:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN (laughing) 

00:25:55
ALLEN E. IVEY You're kinda rich there. So, is there an early story that comes to you that you can tell us about, ah, being autonomous? 

00:26:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Hmm, you're asking me the impossible. I think you also connect to get someone else. I literally do not remember anything with my early childhood. People really question that. (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And we, but I take, undertake autonomy wherever it hits you. 

00:26:15
You will find that clients may often move to an older age to describe the Eriksonian issues 

00:26:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  And my autonomy becomes again, I, I begin to think of, by the time I'm 10, and 11, I began to, ah, remember my childhood and, and that- (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - at that time, I can remember mother having to work. 

00:26:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And, ah, I would come home. My responsibility was to be there. When my brother came, there was a five years age difference. 

00:26:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  And I can remember stoking the, ah, furnace and getting the fire going before it cut ah, you know, when we came home from school. And having, uhm, getting dinner ready and, and taking on the enormous amount of responsibility for myself and for my brother at a very, very early age. Ah, mother was working and not because she wanted to, that's one of the interesting things when I grew up in a family where my mother worked most in my life. 

00:27:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And, ah, and I just proved to be self-sufficient. 

00:27:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  And so, you basically, you're expected to take, take over and run the house. 

00:27:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Not only was I expect, I think that I felt a sense of responsibility. I mean, here was this, ah, family that had, ah, you know, that my mother, certainly, was, I think my mother had some shame and some, of having to work and my father also felt some shame that he couldn't support the family adequately. So I felt that a responsibility of wanting to help, of wanting to make it easier for my family. 

00:27:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And I think that came very early, ah, in, in life for me, and that's when I began to recall, uhm, the, the things that are impact, and the other thing that had impact on me was growing up during World War II and being Jewish. (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And I can remember having nightmares wondering if we had lived in Europe when I die, when I had been taking away from my family. And I think that impacted me tremendously. Ah, and, and there was two things, ah, to being a child, to being Jewish. 

00:28:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN What would have been like if we lived in Europe. Ah, and, and that always was, in the back of my mind to the point or even now, for instance and I won't go to the Holocaust Museum. I can't, I can't allow myself to think about that. 

00:28:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And that so horrified me and so frightened me. So, uhm, those are the two things but I can, as I said, remembering, wanting to relieve the pressure that my parents were feeling. 

00:28:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And the other, this tremendous guilt, you know,- (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - being safe here in this country. Those- 

00:28:40
The Holocaust experience is closely related to the life of all Jews. It also seems to relate to issues of trust and mistrust. 

00:28:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  And so, so that really is the shame and doubt of guilt and that(ph) the fear- (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uh-huh. 

00:28:50
ALLEN E. IVEY - is something that kind of being played out. Ah, and I'm just feeling at the time, did you get any good, ah, here, a responsible side? Did you get any pride or good feeling about the work you're doing? 

00:29:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  Oh, very much so. I mean, I, I, I felt good about what I did. mother always reminds me, and I remember the incidents that ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - they had no money and it was their anniversary and, and my brother and I baked the cake for them and because that's what all they can, we can afford- (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - to do and, and it's, that was a very special moment for her. So I think I really cared and wanted to do the, ah, good things,- (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and, and I don't think as a, that, that I recognized that I was resenting some of that. 

00:29:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I think there was a period where things got a little better for my father where I found myself resenting and my mother working. But my mother was so insecure at that time feeling that she's self-working. And what if- (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - something happened again? So I think there was a short period of time when business was, finances were better and I thought- (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - she should stop working but she, but she never really did. 

00:29:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And, ah, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:29:50
ALLEN E. IVEY So your perception for this kind of shame and embarrassment that your mother was working at that point? 

00:29:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Shame and, and embarrassment- (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Is that right? 

00:29:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - a little bit embarrass, and, and I think they felt shame and embarrassed. I mean,- (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - I think my mother was embarrassed. I think my father- (crosstalk) 

00:30:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - was embarrassed. My father at one time had to drive a taxi- (crosstalk) 

00:30:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and somehow, that was terribly beneath him, in fact, to be a taxi- (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - cab driver. And my pa-, and there were so many of these family secrets. I mean, you didn't want anybody to know about that. 

00:30:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN We also had some mental illness in the family which we didn't anybody to know- (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - about also. So there was always this sort of, uhm, being on a front for someone else. (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And, and, and that had an impact to me and I, I think sometimes I'm tactless now (laughing)- 

00:30:35
ALLEN E. IVEY (laughing). 

00:30:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - in an effort to overcome that there was so much tact. 

00:30:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah(ph). 

00:30:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I think I've gone to the other extreme. 

00:30:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:30:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Because I, and I understood that. 

00:30:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And I understood more as I got older. 

00:30:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And I think that some of those things had really a negative impact on me in my adult life. 

00:30:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. One thing I'm hearing aloud and clear as you've mentioned, there are several very powerful experiences around this issue of autonomy, shame and doubt. We can obviously- (crosstalk) 

00:31:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:31:00
ALLEN E. IVEY - tend to have much more depth ah, for this particular tape. I think we'll have to stop with this tape. 

00:31:05
Initiative vs. Guilt Goals: Explore the stage and examine social context. 

00:31:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  The next Erickson phase, ah, is middle childhood. We've also seen pretty clearly that ah, as we start looking at this patterns, they may be rooted in an age but sometimes recollections don't fit so I think that's fine. Ah, the issue in middle childhood is, ah, initiative versus guilt and, ah, I have here, ah, learning responsibly, representing one's family and culture, ah, 'coz I think initiative exists within a context. Ah, and, ah really, in ages five to seven, but this issue of initiative which is closely related to autonomy, I mean, a little bit differently. (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:31:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And I was wondering, uhm, if there is, ah, a story, ah, thought that occurs to you around the issue of initiative, you taking initiative. (inaudible ) versus guilt for failure to take initiative. 

00:32:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  You know, one of the things I have trouble with Erickson and I'm, and it's, it's, it's becoming more pronounced is that the ages are so constricted and, and- (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - my dealing with initiative, with guilt and with a autonomy, my being able to recollect that is more based on, say, from the time I'm 10 or so,- (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - I suppose, that- (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Time. So- (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - earlier. So, so as I talk about these things. I realize I'm not within that- (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
ALLEN E. IVEY So what is, so what is your story of initiative? 

00:32:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - of initiative. I think the story I told about, ah, when my parents for their making that cake for them, wanting to do something for them. Ah, I think that that, ah, taking care of my brother, wanting to be, ah, (laughing) initiative was one day when I got very mad at taking care of my brother. I took and threw all his clothes out the window. 

00:33:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah. 

00:33:05
The following story clearly reveals how individual development occurs in a family/cultural context. 

00:33:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  One of the nice things, one thing that I remember. Ah, during the Jewish holidays, uhm, particularly, Passover, ah, my grandmother didn't live with us but she would come during Passover and for the Jews at Passover time, if you're religious, you change the dishes, you wash, you scrub the house, and that was my job and I would scrub the stove and clean it and you took a feather and you brushed it with the feathers, symbolic. I'm not sure what that meant. But you did that. And that was my responsibility to do that when, and I remember that with, I remember that in a nice way. I never resented that. It was sort of a wonderful thing. And, ah, my grandmother could not speak English. She was civilian old European woman that wore babushka. And, ah, she would call me Nahapka(ph) and she (inaudible )Nahapka(ph) and she'd been watching over me as to be sure I clean the stove properly. And that's a very pleasant memory. 

00:34:05
ALLEN E. IVEY A very wonderful story- (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:34:05
ALLEN E. IVEY - taking initiative and find something that you're doing and also, ah, wonderful within a cultural frame. One of the things that's, ah,- 

00:34:15
School stories often useful 

00:34:15
ALLEN E. IVEY - happening at that same age is five to seven is, ah, ah, can you give me, ah, a concrete specific example of something during the kindergarten? First grade? Second grade? 

00:34:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN No, I was, I was not a good student- (crosstalk) 

00:34:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:34:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I think. 

00:34:35
ALLEN E. IVEY (inaudible ). 

00:34:38
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  And it was related, by the way, very much with this cousin of mine whose name is Norman who was brilliant. I mean, he was brilliant. He's been very, very successful in the theater and I could never measure up to him so it was really hard. I think I was held down a lot no matter what I did. If I came with, ah, a good paper which I would come home with a nice drawing, it was always in a comparison to what Norman's drawing looked like. And so, it was never, I was never rewarded in that sense for some of the things I was doing and I think that did, ah, later impact me. I kinda think for a while, I gave up in school. 

00:35:10
ALLEN E. IVEY So there's kind of, ah, stopping of initiative at that point. 

00:35:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN At that point, particularly in the area of academia, particularly in the area of academia. Ah, it was much later on that I realized that I was probably smart and could accomplish a lot and, but that came much later, came much later. And it was always balanced because of this cousin of mine who was more like a brother. I mean, we kinda grew up together. And so, it's not as I was a distant cousin. We were almost brother and sister. 

00:35:40
Remember to search for positive strengths 

00:35:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Do you have any positive memories of those first, ah, few years in school or is it more, more again these (inaudible )? 

00:35:48
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I tell you, it's, it's really as I'm walking through this. I, I really can't, maybe that's why I never want to remember. I, I'm unable to sit, I, I guess one of the things I do remember is that when you say picnics, we lived in Detroit at the time. There was this wonderful park called Belle Isle, and we used to go there and we'd do picnics and I remember that as a real positive thing and that was a picture of me on a pony that we went to that- (crosstalk) 

00:36:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah. 

00:36:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And that was a, those, those were nice, those were interspersed with the one negative but that was always a very special occasion. 

00:36:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Now, I wonder during those times, you spoke about your father as this gentle dove, ah, where was he in some of these scenes? 

00:36:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN My mother dominated those scenes. Those where he's, he would always say "Quiet, stop, Belle," or, "It's enough, it's enough." I, at that, remember him always when she was always losing her cool or losing her temper and she had ah, winding the temper. He would always be saying, "Enough, Belle, it's enough." And I can always remember him trying to mollify her. 

00:36:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Now, I'm wondering if you could just think for a minute about your mother as their kinda dominating the situation but your father is saying "enough". Can you visualize your father saying "enough"? And what kind of feelings go out when you think about that? 

00:37:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I was in some ways, angry at and I always felt that he should have taken more control. I mean the, the piece of me that resents the fact that he maybe allowed her. He would rather wash the dishes to smooth the situation over than have her do the dishes or something like that. And the dishes were fun but. 

00:37:20
ALLEN E. IVEY So you're desiring your part to be more protected, is that, is that (inaudible ) 

00:37:24
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yeah. And he would protect it and I, I wish he had, and I think for himself, I wanted him to assert himself more and take more control. There was no question that that was bothering me through my, ah, adult or childhood and adult life. 

00:37:35
ALLEN E. IVEY So you really, you really had no choice but to be autonomous. 

00:37:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:37:40
ALLEN E. IVEY But, but for you to feel any supports growing up. 

00:37:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN No. 

00:37:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Not in school, not from your family, not from your cousin? 

00:37:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Not at all, not at all. 

00:37:45
Life pattern emerging 

00:37:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  And I, as I said, this is sort of interesting that we're talking about that way because I never thought of it that way. 

00:37:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. I think, the emphasis I'm really trying to work out is bringing out strengths of which you have considerable. 

00:38:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN The strengths came. I think myself as a survivor. I think my strengths came as a survivor. 

00:38:05
Reflecting on the first three stages Goals: How does the past affect the present? How are family/cultural issues related to individual development? 

00:38:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  Norma, one thing we like to do, ah, in the developmental model is sometimes to step back and reflect on what has happened earlier or in adult, you know, how it affects us now. And just for a very short time, I'd like to do just the reflection back and, ah, what stands out for you so far, ah, looking back at this, ah, life review, at these various Ericksonian stages? 

00:38:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I think the positive is that, that inspite of the financial turmoil and, and the war, we stood together as a family and we still laugh a lot. I mean I would have to say that my mother had wonderful sense of humor and so do my father. And they could sometimes laugh at themselves and, and, and maybe I didn't appreciate it as a child. Ah, and I only saw the negative, but they survived a rough time, they survived through a rough time getting through, coming here to this country, struggling through their own development. And, and the thing that I remember is that they did best that they, they did the best they could for us, for most of my- (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
ALLEN E. IVEY They did the best. 

00:39:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - brother and myself given the circumstances, given the circumstances they did the best they could. 

00:39:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And one other thing I'd like to is we sort of do a brief review at this stages, ah, in different case, stage, a long, long way you've mentioned, ah, persecuted and forced out of Russia, ah, Latvia, apparently and whether your family was not able to even get their home during World War II. So you're really intermittently entwined with the Holocaust issues et cetera, and then your pride stood up for me and when you talked about cleaning the stove and, ah, his, his loud again- (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I like that. 

00:39:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - ah, so did, did Jewish heritage, you said they're interweaved with this a lot of this, would you mind if I just reflect on this just a moment from your culture. 

00:40:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN The Jewish heritage is very much so, ah, because I think that generation that came, ah, were, some of them were educated but most who were poor, uneducated European Jew-, Eastern European Jews as opposed to West, the German Jews and what they built for their children they lived, they worked to the sweatshops. They, ah, uhm, families lived together and this one bathroom and 10 kids and this sort of thing but, but they instill in their children, ah, self, self sufficiently. They sacrificed for them to go on to college. I can remember that one as a very high priority for my family that my brother and I will go to school. 

00:40:40
ALLEN E. IVEY So in the middle of all of this rough times, there really is a cultural traditions. 

00:40:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Oh. 

00:40:45
ALLEN E. IVEY It's not just you developing autonomy, doing it with the family, and you're also doing this within a rich culture heritage. Am I hearing you right? 

00:40:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Absolutely. 

00:40:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

00:40:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Absolutely my father was very much devoted to being a Jew. My mother was conflicted. She had problems and the Jews were trying to assimilate. (crosstalk) 

00:41:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  Ah, that was part of what you try hide a little bit, there was, ah, the, the wasp, the blue eyes and blond hair was the important part and the, ah, so that was hard for my mother but for my father it was very clear, who he was and what he was in terms of his religion. 

00:41:20
ALLEN E. IVEY So getting your father in some way stands out from that period very strong, clear of who he was but. 

00:41:25
Industry vs. Inferiority Note how Erickson's framework is Based in a Eurocentric perspective Goals: To explore this stage and Consider social context. 

00:41:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  The next Ericksonian stage is late childhood and I think as we look at Erickson, we got to think about this to some extent because we have autonomy, we have industry, and industry versus inferiority is the topic for the childhood initiative. These are of course, ah, a very, and pardon me, very Eurocentric values. 

00:41:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Absolutely. 

00:41:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, sometimes, ah, autonomy really means too much alone, initiative maybe not thinking of others and simply, so these are all kinds of individualistic values and I think we, ah, we should just keep that in mind. The next one is industry versus inferiority and we're here in ages eight to 12 and I think this is where memory started keeping them in, and ah, get a little older and, ah, what's going on in society and for your family at this particular time? 

00:42:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  Well I think that was, certainly what was going on for society was, was ah, uhm, I think it was certainly the, the, the, and again the dominating factor and as I'm growing from a child, my life was the, ah, depression and was then the war because in that, so those were the two. 

00:42:45
ALLEN E. IVEY The war was going on at this particular. 

00:42:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN The war is beginning to, to go on. 

00:42:50
Individual development occurs in social context 

00:42:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And ah, I, I can relate that financial things were better then because, you know, as, as we got into the war, as, as the war, people were beginning to get jobs and the financial issues long, is, is greatly and longer and the lesser of the financial issues and the, ah, the less of the conflicts at home less to the problems at home. 

00:43:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:43:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  My, for me, it me was, ah, more the sort of, ah, feeling that that, that how lucky I was to be in this country where it was safe. 

00:43:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:43:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Very much so and industrian, industrious and. 

00:43:30
Autonomy/Initiative cultural survival issues 

00:43:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - I think that that, ah, I'm gonna say, I think culturally and, and I'm not sure what Erickson and maybe you can make that clear because when I hear the word, the word being industrious, I think that that generation that my parents came out of it and that what they instill in my, in their children was being industrious getting ahead, move, taking initiative, moving on. 

00:43:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:43:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And, and what dominates, I think, in the, uhm, particularly, to that generation of Jews was the fact you didn't know when you could get a job if you were depending on somebody they could always fire but if you - (crosstalk) 

00:44:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN But if could be self-employed or be a professional then you can always take care of yourself and that really was a major, major consideration that, I think, that don't become dependent on, ah, you still on your job, become, you, you become a junk dealer or so get your own still or if you can't, be, become a doctor or lawyer or an accountant and you will always have a profession and I think that that dominating that particular- (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - group that they projected on to their children was a sense of independence and being industrious. 

00:44:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah and which really is also where I supposed to deal with issues of safety and trust- (crosstalk) 

00:44:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Absolutely- (crosstalk) 

00:44:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - is that you, given all, given that. (crosstalk) 

00:44:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  'Coz you don't, you can't trust anybody- (crosstalk) 

00:44:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - so, the only way is that if you can trust yourself, that's the way it's supposed to be- (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and I think that very much was part of the, ah, how Jews felt during that period. And, and right now, the concern is that Jews are so assimilated that in fact they might find out, wake up one day and find out that they can't trust anybody- (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:45:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - there is a difference- (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:45:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - now. And so that's sort of dominated- (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
ALLEN E. IVEY So the issue is the trust and mistrust kinda replay themselves again so those are some really important cultural background. How, at this point, you start getting your friends, can you tell me a story about friends, ah, as you're getting into that age? 

00:45:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Hmm, this is some good area, uhm, uhm, I think that it's interesting but the friendships were really 'coz our family was, was so intertwined, my mother's sister and my mother, there are friendships we were around each other that we really around the children not so much more having many friends, that none until, I began to have some friends in the area of that we lived in and what I remember is sort, I mean, I'm thinking of jumping a little bit ahead of Erickson is, is that I was the only one among, you know, I'm definitely jumping in the Erickson. So what I really remember with my friends is when I really get sort of near junior high that I begin to remember relationships. The younger relationships, I think, I was mostly friend with Norman and I think we spent a lot of time and there were kids on the street together but nothing that really, ah, okay, Mrs. Davis's children. 

00:46:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:46:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN But the underlying character, the, the, the, the, the important thing was the family and the relationship between the cousins, that really was the nucleus. 

00:46:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Family and the cousin were essential and that was some kind of problematic they're always. 

00:46:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And they're always. 

00:46:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:46:55
Identity vs. Role Diffusion Goals: Explore these issues and gender context 

00:46:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, continuing on the next Ericksonian stage is puberty and adolescence, ah, we get into identity versus role confusion. And ah, your, your background to the family is ah, ah, doing better financially- (crosstalk) 

00:47:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:47:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - and more stable. 

00:47:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN There's more stability, more stable, mother continued to work. And I, you know, began to, uhm, I think the thing that moved, if I'd go back to when we talked about friends, the thing I remember most about at that time was that I was different from my friends in the sense that there was this tremendous push for me academically- (crosstalk) 

00:47:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:47:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - ah, to go on to school because somehow that was what all the cousins did. So at that time they were, you know it was like- (crosstalk) 

00:47:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:47:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - college track and commercial track and so forth and I can remember my friends were all in this commercial track and I was the only one who is in the college track- (crosstalk) 

00:48:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and so I never quite fitted in. Ah, my own insecurity is that I'm never gonna make it to college but there was the push from the family- (crosstalk) 

00:48:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and, yet, my friends were all in the commercial- (crosstalk) 

00:48:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and so I had a hard time during that period of, of adolescence. (crosstalk) 

00:48:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Ah, I also think that I was struggling with, did you have very little voice, I was so sort of broad shouldered and I've never thought that how I felt physically as being attractive,- (crosstalk) 

00:48:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - ah, that was I want to be blonde and blue eyed and thin (laughs). 

00:48:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  And here, I was dark, dark eyes little voice. And so I think that I had, uhm, I didn't build a very, in my mind, I was not entirely feminine- (crosstalk) 

00:48:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:48:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and, ah, to this day, you know, I'm very, really ritual, I always sort of want to pull back. And so, ah, I'm painting on a person that was very confident in himself and so I think I was,- (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I, I, and I only think I was, I, I know I wasn't- (crosstalk) 

00:49:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uhm, and I really struggle in fitting in when I was in high school I was just- (crosstalk) 

00:49:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, you're kinda giving some of the inferiority side of the identity versus the one role diffusion. 

00:49:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yeah. And I, and I, and I was having a really hard time with my identity, really hard time. The only wonderful thing, I remember that identity is that I did, ah, act in some of the school plays- (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and I did get a couple of parts. (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And that was very satisfying and I was able to, ah, in a couple of school plays,- (crosstalk) 

00:49:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - was able to be on the stage in this sort of thing. (crosstalk) 

00:49:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And that was very, very satisfying. But I had a hard time, at the time I'd also had a hard time with my daddy as being Jewish- (crosstalk) 

00:49:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - because I got this conflict that was going on between my parents. (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And that, that did pay a, as a- (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN -some of your Jewish and dark hair and dark eyes- (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And, and part of you were- (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - good Christian or Good Waspy and you were kinda looked different. And, and there's no question if that was, ah, ah, a problem. My high school growing up was not one of being very secure about myself. 

00:50:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. So you really kind of, you're very hard even though you had the earlier pride of being Jewish and cleaning the stove and that wonderful tradition, ah, as the time that, where you. (crosstalk) 

00:50:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Once I had to leave the nest basically. 

00:50:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And to leave the nest and you- (crosstalk) 

00:50:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN It became. 

00:50:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - (inaudible ) to the blue-eyed, blond and so forth. 

00:50:22
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. So the, the female part of me that, that I always wanted to be a male, in fact funny that, that I thought of being a man was the greatest thing in the world. 

00:50:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I mean, the worst in the world for me to be a woman, and I did in fact when I had children, I say it only want sons,- (crosstalk) 

00:50:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:50:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - was standing up with only one son, but it was a real rejection of being female- (crosstalk) 

00:50:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - ah, really, I, I know that, that was very much there, and those memories that I can remember. The good memory I had there I remember having this wonderful red outfit, which is so unusual for me, and it was that plaid red skirt with a red sweater, that mother had bought me and I think lived in that foolish thing 'coz I thought I looked so good in this- (crosstalk) 

00:51:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah. 

00:51:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and I remember that. 

00:51:05
ALLEN E. IVEY This thought really good about yourself. 

00:51:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:51:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah. 

00:51:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN It was I, when I had that on, I felt good about myself. 

00:51:10
Intimacy vs. Isolation Goals: Explore these issues in social and gender context 

00:51:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, the next year Eriksonian stage is called young adulthood. (crosstalk) 

00:51:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:51:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And the issue is intimacy versus isolation. Of course, as you well know, ah, Carol Gilligan is kinda blown holes in, ah, the theory pointing out that for woman in particular, the issues of intimacy maybe more, versus isolation, maybe even prior. But we're, we're working at the Erikson framework and critisci-, criticisms of it. But, ah, this is you in the stages 20 to 30 and, ah, what is going on contextually at that point (crosstalk) between the family and environment that stands up for you before we. 

00:51:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Well at that age, I was already married. I got, was married when I was 18, right out of high school. 

00:52:00
ALLEN E. IVEY So you might say at least, you're, you're- (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN (inaudible ). 

00:52:06
ALLEN E. IVEY - the adulthood had began a little earlier for you. 

00:52:06
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN My adulthood became right out on high school when I was married and certainly, ah, that is an event, ah, as opposed to a philosophical change in, in the way one views the world. 

00:52:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:52:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Ah, and it's certainly ah, it was the marriage at that point, ah, for me, meant that I did not go on to school. I did not, could finish college- (crosstalk) 

00:52:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:52:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - or didn't even, I've started for six months and then I ended up being married. 

00:52:40
ALLEN E. IVEY So that's kinda of really a major transition, (inaudible )- (crosstalk) 

00:52:43
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN It was a major. (crosstalk) 

00:52:43
ALLEN E. IVEY - it's real focus on family, the fact that you'd feel you didn't quite fit in high school and boomed at another stage. 

00:52:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  Right. 

00:52:50
ALLEN E. IVEY As, as we started in Erikson and, and everything has shifted. What, what was, what brought this transition? 

00:52:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  Well, we- (crosstalk) 

00:52:55
ALLEN E. IVEY How do you characterize it? 

00:52:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - not only are to shift, ah, that immediately within six months left when we moved to California. 

00:53:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Hhmm. 

00:53:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN So I jumped from sort of being whole and being so part of a, of a community, that family community to being quite independent, we went out to California. And, uhm, I think that, for me, it's a more in but I think having was beginning to mature. I, I, think then I realized, ah, as much as I wanted to be married because that was what you did at that point. 

00:53:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:53:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And then, when you, when you get on high school, you got married and had children, it was from then I began to feel frustrated that I really had missed the part of my life, that I had jumped too fast from, basically from high school to marriage, that there had been no maturing, that I had really not, had not, did not find my identity. My identity was then going to be my husband's identity. I think that was when I became more and more aware of, ah, is that somehow I felt that all of my inadequacies, all from my frustrations could be, as I was married to this very brilliant physicist, that somehow that would ah, be, I would, would integrate that into my own soul- (crosstalk) 

00:54:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:54:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - or to my own identity and I think the part that I learned very quickly was that, that was his identity- (crosstalk) 

00:54:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:54:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and that at some point, I was gonna have to find my own identity. 

00:54:15
Identity issues interface with intimacy: Women particularly may not follow Eriksonian linear stages 

00:54:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  That became somewhat difficult because I was now married and, ah, taking on in a more very traditional marriage where, ah, the expectations when I would have children and the expectations I would stay home and expectations that, ah, he dom-, dominated the, (cough) the household, ah, in this, matter of fact, my marriage to a man is strong is, is, is, is, ah, is bomb, was really tied up the fact, that sometimes my own husband. I had often said that I would never want to be married to a man who didn't assert himself over me 'coz I was somewhere of the fact that I still was someone of, ah, assertive woman or aggressive as we call them. Ah, and very soon after my marriage, I realize I need to find my own identity. 

00:55:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:55:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  And so I begin to struggle. Ah, I remember taking courses at the University of California trying to see if I could really make it- (crosstalk) 

00:55:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:55:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - in school, ah, and coming to a conclusion, yes I could. But, ah, and finally we lived in California, we lived in, in Cornell and then we ended up in New Haven in Yale, and at that time, I realize I was going to have to formally commit myself to a college education, which I did. And in the meantime, the expectation was also I should have children. So during that period, I juggled both. I went, had my children and went to school and took me forever and ever to get through college, but I did get through, and I knew that, that was a very special part of my life. I would finish taking care of the kids and I would end up going to classes with a group of other women, who where also seeking their own identity and in that sense, it was a wonderful time, I look back and I wonder where I had the physical energy to do that. But when you're 20 or 30-years old, you get a lot more energy. Ah, but I knew I had to find my own identity, and I knew if I didn't, and that was my maturity, that unless I found my own identity by the time I reached 40, I was gonna be a very unhappy woman. 

00:56:40
ALLEN E. IVEY So even very early on, can you identify a specific story or incident that led your genesis, a wonderful illustration of Erickson's- (crosstalk) 

00:56:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Well, strangely, yeah. 

00:56:50
ALLEN E. IVEY - theory just plain doesn't fit all the time. 

00:56:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yeah, yeah, strangely enough. It was, I knew that in, in, in, intrinsically in, in, I understood that. 

00:57:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN But before I could actually put in concretely, ah, I read, ah, many (inaudible ). 

00:57:07
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:07
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And I said that's me (laughs). 

00:57:07
ALLEN E. IVEY  The feminine mystique. 

00:57:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And that, oh, it, at that moment I said, but was already on my way, I mean there's already beginning, I was already started going back to school at night but that was the drowning gem. That was it. 

00:57:20
ALLEN E. IVEY So you're really just have a feminism and- (crosstalk) 

00:57:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN That's when I discovered feminism. 

00:57:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - that was a real catalyst to developing your own identity. 

00:57:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN At this point when we, when I was doing that, I was not thinking of terms of feminism, I was thinking in terms of me wanting to have an education, wanting to, ah, be able employ myself, not, I didn't make a distinction between the fact that I thought that I was being subjugated. 

00:57:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:57:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I didn't see that part, I just said from now on, I'm gonna go to school at night, and I continued to be a very traditional wife to care the kids, to be sure that the supper was made, made sure the dishes were done, the kids where in bed, and then I went off to school at night and that was the right way, I mean I- (crosstalk) 

00:57:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - felt that, that was correct. I never, then I watched the younger generation, my own kids, you know, the sharing of more equality more equity between men and women, that didn't exist. 

00:58:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:58:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN But I knew that very, (inaudible ) that I needed my own independence. 

00:58:06
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:06
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And that may come from that background when I was talking about, the lack of trust,- (crosstalk) 

00:58:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN -the, the wanting to- (crosstalk) 

00:58:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Wanting the autonomy. 

00:58:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - autonomy to be safe. 

00:58:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Trying to just play themselves all again. 

00:58:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And, ah, so it was a good, actually those were good years in my life. They were hard years because I was raising a family and going to school but they were, I do have positive memories of those years. 

00:58:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And the personal satisfaction. 

00:58:30
ALLEN E. IVEY So, and of course, contextually, it wasn't much family contextually, the issue of (inaudible ) and the beginning of the women's move up was pretty crucial for you in your- (crosstalk) 

00:58:36
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Oh, very crucial. 

00:58:36
ALLEN E. IVEY (inaudible ), very crucial. Okay just one issue is that, ah, I really hear the word identity real strong in this period. 

00:58:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:58:45
ALLEN E. IVEY What about intimacy? 

00:58:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  Ah, I, I don't, uhm, I don't know, you know, obviously I was married, so there was intimacy. And, ah, I think I, I, I, I can't equate intimacy with my children because I felt I was very, very close to my kids and- (crosstalk) 

00:59:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:59:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - I really felt, ah, a very strong, ah, one of my things was that I was not gonna do to them when I was done to me, I was gonna make them feel that they where three of the most wonderful things that ever came walking in the face of this earth. 

00:59:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:59:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And I gave. 

00:59:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Which, which relates to your own- (crosstalk) 

00:59:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:59:25
ALLEN E. IVEY - experience as a child. 

00:59:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Absolutely, I was not ever going, no mater what they did, they were wonderful. (crosstalk) 

00:59:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:59:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I didn't, ah, I really was not very critical. Now that was okay because they had thought it was reasonable critical and we balanced each other, so they grew up pretty healthy. But I don't think intimacy was, except for being marriage and whatever that, that is certainly intimate. 

00:59:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:59:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN But that, that was not, that need for intimacy for my own personal as we came later in life, became tied with my divorce and this sort of thing. 

00:59:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:59:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN That really did come. 

00:59:55
ALLEN E. IVEY (inaudible ), you're beginning to that. 

01:00:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yeah. We'll get it, it was really identity. I was finding my identity during that period. Obviously, I was retarded. According to Erikson, I was my, my, I developed, but that's important because in that sense, ah, Erikson may have, ah, missed the fact that, that development can come later on and that, ah, that we don't necessarily develop in a very concrete, very specific, very, ah, sort of gradually gladder, that, that it can be erratic. And for me, it was somewhat erratic. 

01:00:30
ALLEN E. IVEY We could go a great length and we will stop. 

01:00:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

01:00:30
Generativity vs. Stagnation Goals: Explore these issues and social context and note how individuals develop holistically 

01:00:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  Norma, ah, as I'm reflecting about, ah, what you've been saying so far and you could kinda illustrate for me, I think, that the Eriksonian theories are useful in terms of the constricts and yet they get so modified by culture and individuality and I think you're, got a passionate discussion of identity and how culture and gender interfaced with you're- (crosstalk) 

01:01:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Huh. 

01:01:00
ALLEN E. IVEY - that you're identity is very, very powerful for me to listen to. Ah, and, and I think about this, I know of something about the next phase of your life that's really kind of we're knowing you as adult that says ages 30 to 65. Ah, Erikson talks about generative, generativity versus stagnation and I know is direct of this, that the, you had your children who grew up, ah, you went on and got a doctorate, ah, you found that every woman center you massed, well first woman or first woman sat in a country. Ah, you went on from there to a divorce, you went from there to becoming the first warden of a major prison, would be grab in bed and breakfast. And, ah, all in the same space, ah, looked to your early retirement. So a lot happened during adulthood. And ah, ah, generative versus stagnation, I'm just wondering how you're gonna handle presenting all those data. 

01:01:55
Norma develops holistically and resolves many life issues in this age period. 

01:01:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  Well, but, uhm, but I think that that really is, is, uhm, let me just think how I wanna say this, that I continue to grow. (crosstalk) 

01:02:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:02:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN That in some sense, that was the, the Erikson's model was a little bit too well defined in terms of sequence, that I was a little out of sequence. But even though I, the early, my early sequence didn't, uhm, sometimes, I didn't, ah, I didn't, I, I didn't grow up with trust. I grew up with mistrust and some of those that I didn't probably would have been better of had they, had it more secure childhood. I think I compensated that for my in my adult life that, that even if you miss developmentally some of the early stages, it doesn't mean that you can't make up for them at the later stage. It may then take more, uhm, ah, energy on your part, but you are not, you don't have to stagnate. And I think that was, if I learned anything from my childhood was surviving, to be able to move on, not to, to be, ah, restricted by what I didn't get but think about what I could get. And I think that, uhm, ah, that adulthood for me has been, was a wonderful adulthood. I mean, it was, I continually grow, grew far beyond anything I had ever expected, in my earlier life. (crosstalk) 

01:03:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:03:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uhm, and I even finished up the last two or three years going back to doing just individual therapy, which was also sort of uhm, an experience I wanted. Uhm, I think this new period where I retired, is, is one of the hardest. 

01:03:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, we'll let's hold on that- (crosstalk) 

01:03:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN We'll hold on that. Okay. 

01:03:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - hold on that. I'd like to, I think, ah, people would be interested hearing a little a bit about the story from, ah, you grow from this, child who's told you, they're not adequate as a scholar and you're doing a doctorate, just one if you tell me the story about you're doctorate. 

01:04:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Well, maybe I'll go because my doctorate was not nearly as important as any of my Bachelor's degree. 

01:04:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Your bachelor's degree, okay. 

01:04:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Which is very interesting 'coz I remember I graduated from Southern Connecticut College in, in New Haven and I can remember not one during my graduation, and my husband and my children said, "This is ridiculous." I said, "Well, you know, had I been take any normal growing up child, I would have already had my degree," but they insist that I get my degree. And I remember going and picking up the cat and gown, and I can see myself just running up the stairs, going to my bedroom, putting in a wand and just looking at myself in the mirror. (crosstalk) 

01:04:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  And then I had done, you know, the expectation of my parents had always had for me, had accomplished it. I felt great satisfaction 'coz I did it against the lot. (crosstalk) 

01:04:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I mean, there were lot of things in my way that could have prevented me and that was that getting that Bachelor's degree, I'll wait anything. I mean getting my doctorate was rather exciting because that's, in fact, my husband had it to me. I don't remember a graduation, he gave me my new, put my coat on. But those were wonderful moments but that moment of my, that I had done the task I had finish school was. 

01:05:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  Manage test from childhood kinda completed all at once. 

01:05:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN In, in some ways, I completed it in all the, maybe all that comes in with, that I never resented my childhood maybe, because I overcame the obstacles. And so I'm not, I don't carry a lot of baggage. What if I might have? I don't feel that way, I was somehow able to do it, and I think that, ah, particularly the, uhm, ah, becoming really, ah, feminist and, uhm, being able to be you in that, there were many women in my age did not grab the opportunity to move forward and I see them know someone regretting. Some of them having went on to college but not having pursued a career. I figured there was a piece missing. I don't feel that way. So I don't, uhm, ah, I look back and say, "Well, what if?" 

01:06:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm, you did it. 

01:06:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I did it. (crosstalk) 

01:06:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:06:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And it's, it's a good feeling. 

01:06:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  Okay. So, we've got a wonderful story of accomplishment, ah, yourself as a feminist, what are some other stories you like to tell from adulthood? 

01:06:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Well, I think that, in terms of accomplishment, ah, I can, I think when I was a director of Patuxent, I would have to testify. (crosstalk) 

01:06:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  Director of Patuxent, that's the prison? 

01:06:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Prison. Ah, I would have to testify in front of the legislature, and I couldn't do that with a great deal of poise and I could hold my own, sometimes I may ask the legislators. I think the thing that, that, the years at Patuxent were, where we had control of parole. I think the thing that hits me that I remember there is that we were making decisions that people would have bought books in sociology that we didn't make coz we were making life or death decisions not only for the inmates but for society. And, and when I reflect back on that, I sometimes wonder how I was so arrogant to make those decisions. 

01:07:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:07:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  I'm not sure that it's interesting. I'm not sure I could do that now, maybe that as we mature and as we gain experience, we lose some of our risk-taking. I mean, and,- (crosstalk) 

01:07:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:07:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and that, ah, sometimes I was too naïve to be, to be dumb. Ah, so I think, that the, the responsibility of Patuxent and that I was able to make some of those decisions and made to live with them, ah, was, was, ah, I, I, sometimes I'm proud of myself for that and even though to some extent society questioned my judgment. 

01:07:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And you were pulled up in front of, ah, the state legislatures too liberal, I know? 

01:07:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  I know. But I held my own with that and, ah, and I have, and, and what I'm really trying to explain to them is that they're, they had legislative what I was doing. They would not take responsibility. I was simply the functionary doing what they said. But I think I, ah, maybe became cynical and realize that there has to be, ah, if you could get, if you could get involved in a political situation, sooner or later, someone's going to be a scapegoat. 

01:08:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:08:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And I think that, uhm, it was very hard, this is what happened to me at Patuxent. Ah, and it took me a long time to overcome it because I. 

01:08:15
ALLEN E. IVEY People don't know you were fired ultimately. 

01:08:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yeah, then I was ultimately, ah, forced into ah, I was forced into resigning, basically, I was fired but I resigned. Ah, ah that, uhm, that I felt for a long time really kinda, I think at that point, I left there someone bitter. 

01:08:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:08:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And it's gone now and I think that took me a long time, I think to, to recover. Maybe that's my strength that, that, that I can face an obstacle. I go through a period where I probably hit rock bottom and depressed but then I pull myself up. Now, I have to say for all my criticism with my mother, I think I got that from her.(laughing) 

01:08:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  And, and. 

01:08:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I think I got the piece from my father, but that fighting instinct I got from her. 

01:08:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And what about intimacy? 

01:09:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Well, then, I think that was when I began to realize that I didn't want to grow old with my husband because I was the one that left and divorce. I, I, left, and I met the man I'm married to now. And whatever it was, it clicked and there was the person that I could be intimate. There was the person that I needed that could respond to my needs. But I think the other part is that he had needs and I could give him. 

01:09:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:09:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I often felt that my first marriage that, ah, that I wasn't really needed that there was not anything I could give. Now that was a misperception because I know that later on that that wasn't accurate. But for Ralph and I, it was very open that we both need to reach hands, something you give each other. And there was equity in the relationship. 

01:09:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:09:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  And that was really, uhm, is painful as the divorce was, both for myself, for Ralph, for his wife and for my husband. Ah, I think in the end, we both, all four benefit because I could never give Pa what he needed. I could probably not give him the intimacy he needed. (crosstalk) 

01:10:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:10:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Whereas, I could give that to Ralph. (crosstalk) 

01:10:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:10:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And I think Ralph couldn't give the intimacy to his wife that he needed to give. It was not a messy divorce. Ah, and I did put myself a little bit. I wanted another relationship. (crosstalk) 

01:10:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:10:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I wanted intimacy. And, and I got my identity, I got all that- (crosstalk) 

01:10:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:10:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - but I didn't have intimacy. (crosstalk) 

01:10:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:10:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And I. 

01:10:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And sort of really in this whole adult period, you do the identity, you do the intimacy, you do the generativity- (crosstalk) 

01:10:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I grew up. 

01:10:30
ALLEN E. IVEY - you could almost have it. You, you grew up. 

01:10:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  I grew up. 

01:10:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

01:10:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And that, this I s interesting coz I would not have thought now that that really makes me feel and I think anybody listened to tape, but just because there are stages in your life where you maybe a stagnant or if you don't develop according to any kind of structure which ah, that doesn't mean that you can't go on. And I think that's what's the important message here. But I think it took a lot of, I think of myself credible. I have strength, a lot of courage, a lot of belief in myself. 

01:11:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Thank you. 

01:11:00
Ego Integrity vs. Despair Goals: Review of the life review 

01:11:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, the next stage, unfortunately, ah, Erikson calls old age. 

01:11:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I'm already angry with Erikson. (laughing) 

01:11:15
ALLEN E. IVEY You're already angry. Well, let's just say that, ah, ah, and, and as we both know that, ah, there really is the, the, the young ah, ah, the young elderly, I prefer the word "elder" myself, ah, the sort of middle aged and then old-old. But old-old really isn't until we get to our parents at 85, ah, and beyond. I mean, very, very different characteristics, ah, in these three stages. And, ah, we talked about ego integrity versus despair and, ah, in some sense, I guess I have to say but I hear, just I've heard you said, just in the preceding segments really kind of, might be a summary of ego integrity and, ah, feeling good about where you've been and where you are. Ah, I was wondering, ah, what are your reflections, ah, on, ah, I guess both of us moved to this challenging next transition. 

01:12:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN My second adulthood. 

01:12:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Your second adulthood. That's a good way to talk, your second adulthood. 

01:12:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN My second adulthood. Uhm, interesting 'coz that's certainly is what I had been struggling with. I mean, just go back, I, uhm, make the decision to stop, no, we're working but basically retired from full-time job about just two years ago. It's a year, it's a year and a half that I haven't worked at all other than doing some consulting. And it's been a hard, it's been hard for me to, uhm, almost redefine my life. One of the things I think that for at least for me and for maybe many women in my generation that have gone to work and become professional, and I think maybe for men more so than any for women in this generation, 'coz I didn't know how to play. (crosstalk) 

01:13:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:13:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  That had been taken out of my life. And as I, and as I think about it as, as, as I go back to my childhood because of the financial situation, mother working. Much of my life was, didn't have too much time to play. I do remember now one instance where I did get a wonderful bike and proceeded to smash it the first day. I know and why I had foregone, that was a birthday present. Ah, but, ah, I didn't know how to play. So one of the things was, ah, to learn how to play. To learn to feel that even if I didn't, ah, if I wasn't teaching or I wasn't running a prison or I wasn't, ah, doing therapy, that if I just played tennis or I played golf, or I played bridge, that was okay. That was legitimate. But I have been so indoctrinated to feel that you need to be industrious, you need to be doing something. (crosstalk) 

01:13:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:13:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN But it took me a while to appreciate the fact that there were other things. And so,- (crosstalk) 

01:14:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:14:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - one of the things that, that, and it's really been in this last year. I recognized that I approached physical fitness, almost like it was my job. (crosstalk) 

01:14:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:14:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN But it was important for me coz what I think I discovered was another piece of my identity,- (crosstalk) 

01:14:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:14:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - the identity of the little girl, the identity of somebody who knew how to play. Ah, I always, if, if you call, if you recall what I said, one of the things that I thought of myself as being very masculine, not a feminine, well, I think one of the things that I didn't do was athletics- (crosstalk) 

01:14:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:14:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - 'coz women didn't do that. That was too masculine. Well, now, it's sort of like, when my tennis coach said to me, "You must be a very good athlete," and that's pretty good. I was a terrible athlete. But I, so, one of the things that for me is to believe not so, that I'm not looking for specific, ah, events like marriage or like getting my degree but I'm looking at maybe a philosophical change in how I view the world in terms of how I see myself and as long as I believe that I can still grow. I mean, that, that I'm not gonna stagnate, and I think that's the big problem- (crosstalk) 

01:15:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:15:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - that sometimes we, I can't look forward to a future becoming another more, you know? 

01:15:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And so the generative versus stagnation, you still wanna be generative. 

01:15:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I still want to be generative. 

01:15:20
ALLEN E. IVEY But I also hear in this real loud and clear, you know, just looking back to, a quick view through Erikson's theory, I guess, ah, poor Erik Erikson didn't have much play or fun in his life 'coz there's not a lot of task, ah, that he has. So let's talk- (crosstalk) 

01:15:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN That's interesting. 

01:15:30
ALLEN E. IVEY about getting fun. 

01:15:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And, and that maybe, is, is that the western culture? (crosstalk) 

01:15:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  Hmm. 

01:15:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Is that our culture? 

01:15:40
ALLEN E. IVEY No, I think it's considered to be a dimension. (crosstalk) 

01:15:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

01:15:40
ALLEN E. IVEY No time to be or always doing. 

01:15:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  That's right. And so, that all, I think I'm trying to learn to play and I'm, and I'm also looking at people differently. (crosstalk) 

01:15:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:15:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I'm not being as demanding in my expectations, particularly of women, coz I'm encountering now women who didn't go on professionally like I did. (crosstalk) 

01:16:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:16:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And, at, at one time I would think of my plain bridge and going to one chance and sort of, how could you? (crosstalk) 

01:16:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:16:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And I don't feel that way. And I, I met some very intelligent women that got caught into the, unable to get out from under where they were, but that doesn't distract from them in, in terms of, uhm, their intellectual abilities, in terms of their sensitivity. (crosstalk) 

01:16:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:16:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  So I think I'm becoming also more tolerant. 

01:16:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And so, tolerant, more open, but I also know, ah, there's another issue that comes out and that's caring for older parents. And your mother is still alive. 

01:16:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. That's been hard. That's been probably the most difficult for me in the last years to see this woman who I in one level, had been very critical of and on the other hand, ah, admire because she was a survivor because she was able to take care of herself and I see her degenerating, I see her mind slipping, and I'm finding that very hard. And what I'm finding is that I tend to become angry and emotional. And I'm not sure that the anger I'm feeling is just because she's getting old, and why is she doing this or whether I'm carrying a lot of hostility from my early childhood. But I am working this through. But then it has been very hard that's, that's, I'm, I am not handling that as well as I've handled other things,- (crosstalk) 

01:17:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:17:20
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN -ah, and have allowed myself to get emotionally really tied up on this seeing this woman. Uhm, I am, in fact at some point I felt I almost had to seek some help in, in dealing with the issue of, of an older parent that's struggling. One of the things, I think, I've gotten out of this, I see her reflecting negatively on her life, her childhood. (crosstalk) 

01:17:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:17:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN It's interesting how you go back. (crosstalk) 

01:17:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:17:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And that she has a lot of unresolved conflicts. (crosstalk) 

01:17:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:17:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  And if I were to say anything, I don't want to have all those unresolved conflicts I wanna be at peace with myself- (crosstalk) 

01:18:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:18:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - when I get to that point. That, that's the, and I'm not sure I will make it but at least, one of the things that I think that, that I've always been good at is managing my life. (crosstalk) 

01:18:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:18:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Ah, I knew at some point, I had to go on to college. I knew these things. I almost feel I have to manage my life from an old age. 

01:18:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. And one of the things that does seem to happen is that we renegotiate these relationships with our parents, our family,- (crosstalk) 

01:18:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

01:18:25
ALLEN E. IVEY - our environment, again and again and again. 

01:18:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yes. 

01:18:25
Summary and Reflections on the Process 

01:18:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  Well, this is the, the final section. Norma, I'd like you to, ah, sort of reflect back on this whole series and, ah, what thing or things stand out for you, ah, from, from the discussion. 

01:18:50
[sil.] 

01:18:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  Well, I think that this is a very interesting and, uhm, not, not, I feel, I should say, more interesting, a very instructive way of, of dealing, one of the things that has concerned me is how you deal with people who have had the, the whole area geriatric counseling and, and this is a very helpful way of helping someone at this stage of their life come to understand their life and how they arrived at where they, they are now. Now, in my case, it was utilizing what happened to me in my younger period- (crosstalk) 

01:19:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:19:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - in a very pleasant way. I guess what a concern I have, this is one of the reasons I want you to tape, was how do you help somebody who is struggling with this age of retirement if they can't reflect in a kind of positive way that I've reflected. 

01:19:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:19:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN That that, ah, that that's still is an unknown for me- (crosstalk) 

01:19:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:19:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - because I think that sometimes I have been asking you some therapy and in terms of the area of people during retirement, how do we help them face this new stage so they can feel that they are still growing. 

01:20:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Yeah, and I think, one thing that stands out for me is the, the need, ah, and so you will sort of criticize but then we come back. Though, Erikson has some good stuff, the need to resolve some of these tests within a cultural frame eventhough Erikson isn't complete, the idea of him pretty clear. He resolves so many things in adulthood that hadn't become before. 

01:20:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And, and that was very important (inaudible ). 

01:20:28
ALLEN E. IVEY And there are people who reach old age that need to, that have still not worked through those tasks. 

01:20:30
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And, and that, that, that's one thing that I think I am very conscious of. Ah, and I, and I think Erikson's right. There are all these developmental tasks. They made very from culture to culture but each have developmental task. And if we don't get, come to some closure with them,- (crosstalk) 

01:20:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:20:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - then I think those last years can be much less satisfying and productive. 

01:20:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. And I think you illustrate the importance of play being a developmental task- (crosstalk) 

01:20:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yes. 

01:20:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - as you get along, but particularly, as you get older. Ah, I also, a second type of reflection I'd like you to, to throw, throw in there is, ah, the whole interweaving of being Jewish, the cultural, spiritual heritage and, ah, what do you, ah, what occurs to you as I throw in those words here as we leave toward the end. 

01:21:15
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN I, I think not, of the spiritual aspect and I'm not sure totally by being Jewish or whether you've been to some other faith, that there is a need for some spirituality in this, in this point in one's life and as a matter of fact, more often I were willing to, ah, compare it with religion, uhm, ah, course, and looking at different, ah, religions, different, ah, whether you, that there has to be belief in something and that there can be some peace and some spirituality. And, and, ah, that's part, I don't think I have accomplished or achieved that. I think it is something that I am struggling with now. Ah, and I think it is something to be into struggle with in this age, I mean, what, what is, what is the meaning of life. (crosstalk) 

01:22:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:22:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And eventhough I have felt at peace in terms of my accomplishments and my identity, I think, there's another peace that I haven't found yet. (crosstalk) 

01:22:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:22:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN And that's, that is the spirituality which I think I am going too need and I'm not sure I will find it in being, going back to study Judaism. But I think I could find it in, in beginning to appreciate the nature and appre-, and appreciate almost from a Buddhist point of view- (crosstalk) 

01:22:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:22:25
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - of the world. And, and, and that's another area in terms of where Ralph and I are sharing to you. I have to emphasize that, that, ah, that having someone to, one is intimate with is also very important at this stage in your life. 

01:22:35
ALLEN E. IVEY (inaudible ) by the spiritual development. 

01:22:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN (inaudible ). 

01:22:41
ALLEN E. IVEY And as you think about a, a Buddhist and, ah, a nat-, nature-view spirituality, you still are including your, ah, Jewish heritage- (inaudible )(crosstalk) 

01:22:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Absolutely. 

01:22:50
ALLEN E. IVEY - as part of your,- (crosstalk) 

01:22:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Absolutely. 

01:22:50
ALLEN E. IVEY - part of your being. 

01:22:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN But it doesn't have to be, the, the scripture, it doesn't have to read the bible as such or the Torah(ph) in this age for the, for the Jewish. 

01:22:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:22:55
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Interesting enough, my children become more or my, my, one of daughters had become very, very religious- (crosstalk) 

01:23:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah. 

01:23:00
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN - and seeks out this now that I. 

01:23:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. So, you have that part for us. 

01:23:05
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Yes. Yes. 

01:23:05
ALLEN E. IVEY So, as we wind up, ah, any final words you'd like to share? 

01:23:10
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Ah, the, well, let's say that this was, ah, was very, uhm, if not therapeutic, it was very satisfying to talk to somebody who, ah, really gave some structure because I think sometimes when you talk about one's life, it seems sort of there's no structure to it, this happened and that happened, a series of events. (crosstalk) 

01:23:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:23:35
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Whereas I think I saw this as sort of a sequence of transitions. Ah, and this was very, very helpful. 

01:23:40
ALLEN E. IVEY What central thing did you draw out? 

01:23:40
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN  For me? 

01:23:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:23:45
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN It gave me a sense of, of peace. 

01:23:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Thank you. 

01:23:50
NORMA BLOCK GLUCKSTERN Thank you.
