MAKING MEMORIES with Lana Morris a programme from The School of Health & Social Sciences, University of Wales, Newport 

00:00:25
MIKE SIMMONS Hello, my name is Mike Simmons and I work at the University of Wales, Newport. Lana Morris has been a social worker since 1994 and a social work lecturer here at the university since 2004. In her time in practice she worked with a wide range of service users in both statutory and voluntary settings and this had a particular interest in dementia both as a result of that work and work she has done with the carers of service users. Lana, dementia is a pretty frightening experience for all concerned, what do we need to be aware of? 

00:01:00
LANA MORRIS Well, I think first of all to recognize that dementia is a decline in intellectual abilities and that it can affect people in very different ways. So if for some people it's about memory loss and some will have experiences of impairment or disability to make decisions. It can be very socially isolating, umm… so the whole experiences you know looking at that decline and the impact then has on the individual. 

00:01:30
MIKE SIMMONS So what are the causes of dementia? 

00:01:35
LANA MORRIS To say some of the causes of dementia are things like Alzheimer's disease, stroke, Parkinson's disease, umm… alcohol toxicity umm… having any infections to central nervous system or head injuries and some of the accompanying symptoms of dementia maybe things such as anxiety or sleeplessness, umm… agitation, can be sometimes experience paranoia, depression, which can co-exist with dementia and apathy. 

00:02:10
MIKE SIMMONS This sounds quite unpredictable. 

00:02:10
LANA MORRIS It is unpredictable. I mean there are some situations where you can see the decline occurring and there is a period of time between the diagnosis if you like and then it's becoming to the point where somebody doesn't perhaps recognize family members, etc. Umm… But there are things that you can do during this period of time. 

00:02:30
MIKE SIMMONS What sort of things? 

00:02:30
LANA MORRIS Well one of the things that I am particularly interested in is looking at memory album making which is also known as scrap booking and it's something that as many been in the craft out field and arena umm… to look out preserving memories. I think probably the most common that we have seen in recent years is being more people have gone to look up the family tree for example and then some photographs of ancestors and memory album making is just that is getting photographs of family members, of friends, of significant life events and being able to preserve them in an album with writing to enable people to recall memories and experiences that they had. 

00:03:15
MIKE SIMMONS It sounds a very powerful thing. 

00:03:15
LANA MORRIS I think it can be. There is an huge amount of if you like clinical research around the use of scrapbooks with people with dementia, but it's a growing area so I would expect to see this happening in the next following 10 years and what we have seen is things like light story books which we use for younger people have been researched quite well and have proved to be very… very successful in helping people through transitional life events. So I think this has the opportunity to provide the same type of tool, same benefits if you like for people with dementia. 

00:03:50
MIKE SIMMONS And that's what we're looking at today. 

00:03:55
LANA MORRIS Yes. 

00:03:55
MIKE SIMMONS And it feels like there is something about kind of anchoring memories trying to hold on to them before they drift away? 

00:04:00
LANA MORRIS That's right umm… mean memory album making or scrapbooking is I prefer to call it is talking really about holding those memories and being able to spend time with somebody who has dementia both in terms of producing the memory album, but also going through the pages that you have already created with them to enable them to recall particular experiences or events. It also is linked to reminiscence therapy where usually you'd have group of people where you would bring an item to that group and then you'd talk about the reason, the significance of the item and it can be an aid to transition of life events as well as recalling painful memories and positive memories. 

00:04:45
MIKE SIMMONS So, is there something here about and this is something you might make with someone with dementia, but then something that you might use a later day with adverse? 

00:04:55
LANA MORRIS Yes, I mean it is a tool for you to be able to recall as a (inaudible), but equally it's… it's helpful to get somebody involved in the compilation of those memories so certainly if you have the early onset of dementia umm… when somebody still has coherence and still is able to recall they may find this very therapeutic way of enabling them to recall those events when perhaps later on they may not be able to. 

00:05:20
MIKE SIMMONS It feels to me like a old message in the bottle. I might send out to myself later on. 

00:05:25
LANA MORRIS Yes, yes. Hmm… I think one of the things to say with scrapbooking its very creative so certainly it's a means of spending time with somebody and actually really getting to know them finding out what the significant smells all that recall about a particular photograph or who is in the photograph and what memories that listed for them and whether they were positive experiences or they may not be. I mean it might be the loss of a family member through bereavement, but it gives the opportunity for somebody to be able to talk about those and recall those events. 

00:06:05
MIKE SIMMONS And I guess this is a process that (inaudible) all of us kind of coming across the photograph of an event that we forgot from years ago. 

00:06:10
LANA MORRIS Yes. 

00:06:15
MIKE SIMMONS But it's kind of using that in quite a therapeutic way. 

00:06:15
LANA MORRIS Yes, I mean it's the opportunity really to spend time with somebody. I think some of the perhaps criticism if you like of from social workers for example is that they don't spend enough time with people. So it gives… 

00:06:30
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:06:30
LANA MORRIS …a feel like a very valid opportunity to spend that time to really get to know somebody to find out what choices they made, what experiences they had through their own lives and how that links to where they perhaps are at now and who are significant people in their lives at the moment. 

00:06:50
MIKE SIMMONS Let me just check, because it sounds like you are saying this is something someone might do with a relative, but it sounds like you're also saying this is something a social worker or health professional might also do with a patient or the service user. 

00:07:10
LANA MORRIS Yes absolutely. I mean there are examples if you feel like live story work with young people live in care, looked after children, so it's quite a versatile tool to be able to use with anybody where you're having to recall a history sort of a pre and post experience umm… and anybody can use it. It's some… entirely up to you, how you do it, what text is you want to use or photographs, how you want to recall those memories? Some people for examples will do scrapbooking all on the computer. Others like they feel if the paper in the physical doing and producing it. So they are very-very… very many different ways of doing it. 

00:07:50
MIKE SIMMONS And what way we're going to be talking about that something we did earlier today, which was very much practical hands on with the materials and the fabrics rather than computer based. 

00:08:00
LANA MORRIS Yes that's right. So it's very physically produced rather than sitting in front of the computer and doing it digitally. 

00:08:05
MIKE SIMMONS Because what happened earlier on is two colleagues of ours were in the same studio with you, with the materials with the photographs and with an awful lot of pair of scissors. 

00:08:20
LANA MORRIS Yes. I think the… the creativity about scrapbooking is you do get the opportunity to use very many different materials and mediums and I think what we have done this morning is try and start with very simply based scrapbook pages, with a couple of pages some ideas about what those pictures were about, decorating the pages and then leaving them to stand as a opportunity that later stage where you can go back and recall those members. 

00:08:50
MIKE SIMMONS So let's look at the process of what you were doing. You started off with a simple page. 

00:08:55
LANA MORRIS Yes, yes. I mean the first part really is to decide on what your photographs has got in terms of is there black and white photograph, is there a color photograph and then choosing some papers to then either ensure that there is a contrast or that it complements the colors in your photograph. The next stage then was to choose a different patterned paper so we have plain piece of paper, one pattern paper and then decide it on how we wanted to then put photograph on those sheets, whether we wanted the plain to be what we call a mat, where we replace the photograph on the plain paper and use it as a frame for the photograph and then it's up to you then where you want to locate that picture on your piece of paper. 

00:09:40
MIKE SIMMONS Well I guess the ideal thing when you say it's up to you. The ideal thing is it is the person with dementia… 

00:09:45
LANA MORRIS That's right. 

00:09:45
MIKE SIMMONS …who ideally is going to be doing this. 

00:09:50
LANA MORRIS Yes, yes. 

00:09:50
MIKE SIMMONS They are the ones playing with the materials. 

00:09:55
LANA MORRIS Yes and for some people they will need a support to do that so it maybe that it starts a discussion between the person helping and the person with dementia to look out the best location of their photographs. Some photographs might have very limited writing to go with them, umm… somebody might just say, "Oh that's my son's wedding." Alternatively they might have a lot to say and therefore you want to keep enough space on that page so that you can add your writing to make sure that you know what's happening in that picture. 

00:10:25
MIKE SIMMONS I'm just thinking about my son's wedding and thinking Oh, I might want to out all sorts of things that, I think this touches by as were talking about earlier. I might want to put what I was feeling while I was waiting for the bride to arrive. 

00:10:40
LANA MORRIS Yes. 

00:10:40
MIKE SIMMONS How that felt to be in the church and I might want to be writing down something that I thought about the reception, might want to be writing something about the argument that I had with my wife on the way back or the fun we had getting ready… getting in the church (inaudible), all sorts of things like that. 

00:11:00
LANA MORRIS Yes absolutely. 

00:11:00
MIKE SIMMONS And the picture would be the sort of source of those other memories and I guess those memories then create sort of memories a further memories. 

00:11:10
LANA MORRIS Yes, I mean it's partly recollection, but it's all so being able to feel like make the connections with those other memories. So for example there might be a particular smell it might be from the brides bouquet and you might have a pressed flower of that bouquet which will infuse with the paper and you will have the smell so it's not just visual that will be smells that people will stir memories. There are now techniques where you can have mini recordings so you can actually have voices and put those on to the pages, bit like you get in those Christmas, Christmas or birthday cards when you open. 

00:11:45
MIKE SIMMONS Right. Yeah, yeah. 

00:11:50
LANA MORRIS And you can now report your own messages. So there are very different ways of holding memories and usually it's three to five senses. 

00:11:55
MIKE SIMMONS And of course that would be also very much easier if it was computer based. 

00:12:00
LANA MORRIS Yes. 

00:12:00
MIKE SIMMONS Because (inaudible) the image was coming to my head is of a jigsaw puzzle. 

00:12:05
LANA MORRIS Hmm… hmm. 

00:12:05
MIKE SIMMONS And the fear for the person with dementia is those pieces all get a kind of broken up. 

00:12:15
LANA MORRIS Yes. 

00:12:15
MIKE SIMMONS You know when you buy new jigsaw puzzle sometimes, it's all held together and you sort of dismantle it. 

00:12:20
LANA MORRIS Hmm… hmm. 

00:12:20
MIKE SIMMONS And it's something about we're trying to make sure those pieces stay together and don't become a series of… 

00:12:30
LANA MORRIS Fragments. 

00:12:30
MIKE SIMMONS Fragments, yeah. 

00:12:30
LANA MORRIS Yes, yes. I mean I think what this does of if there is an opportunity to create the frame. I think sometimes when we start jigsaws which we are always taught to so the frame first… 

00:12:40
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, yeah. 

00:12:40
LANA MORRIS to get the structure and then we can fill in the middle base and in a sense scrapbooking is very similar to that, but be able to create the photographs and the writing to remember those significant events you can put them chronologically so you could take somebody will actually through the childhood, their adulthood(ph), their working life there retirement right through to where they are now. Or it may be around particular themes if somebody had particular burning passion of being a sailor or owned a boat then you can build your scrapbooking around those particular themes that are important to the person. 

00:13:20
MIKE SIMMONS There was something you were saying that maybe think and it's not just about happy memories. It's about entirety of experience. 

00:13:30
LANA MORRIS Yes, yes. It… I think with scrapbooking you can't predict in a sense the type of memories that those photos may elicit and similarly when you are working with people with dementia you don't always know the history before perhaps they came to the service that you might be working in. Umm… So I think whoever is working with scrapbooking and working with people with dementia to create a scrapbook has to be aware that it doesn't always mean positive memories will occur and therefore you need to feel quite confident and comfortable and also being able to support somebody who might have quite painful memories stirred as a result of creating a scrapbook. 

00:14:10
MIKE SIMMONS Painful memories that they will have forgotten of course. 

00:14:15
LANA MORRIS Yes, yes. 

00:14:15
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:14:15
LANA MORRIS And therefore they might be re-experiencing that for what they perceive is the first time. 

00:14:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right, yes. The other thing that I'm personally interested in is recording mundane things. We take pictures of well of weddings and of holidays and family occasions and so on, but we don't take pictures of our kitchen sink or favorite mug or the stairs and yet they are the things are hugely familiar to us. 

00:14:45
LANA MORRIS Yes, yes. And I think the more mundane they might be seem to be the better really because it is about helping somebody reconstruct memories and therefore you just don't know what the trigger will be. It could just be the particular toothbrush they had in the bathroom or it might be particular photograph or picture that they purchased that they had hanging on their wall. It could be a… to know fluffy rug. You just don't know so the more mundane everyday type of umm… photographs you can take, the more change you have of reconstructing some of those memories and we're creating the opportunity for people to then recall. 

00:15:25
MIKE SIMMONS And you use let's say photographs, you use some quite intentionally you were getting (inaudible)to crop photographs… 

00:15:35
LANA MORRIS Yes. 

00:15:35
MIKE SIMMONS …as they wanted them to be, a bit that matter to them. You are asking them to consider what mats they were going to use, what color they were going to use, so what color they were going to use for the background. 

00:15:45
LANA MORRIS Hmm… hmm. 

00:15:45
MIKE SIMMONS It was very much about using them for whatever purpose they had in mind. 

00:15:50
LANA MORRIS Yes, yes. I think part of scrapbooking is that it's an enjoyable activity or should be an enjoyable activity. It's an opportunity where in a sense you're hoping to engage somebody in something that they enjoy doing. Umm… So that when they are then looking at the photographs they have when we look at photograph we don't always perhaps like the way we took the photo although we like the memory that associated with it. 

00:16:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:16:20
LANA MORRIS And therefore it's entirely up to you how you then want to prevent your photograph. So there is a bit of a if you like a reconstructing that picture but the purpose is to recall. 

00:16:35
MIKE SIMMONS To… To recall its real meaning. 

00:16:35
LANA MORRIS Yes. 

00:16:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:16:35
LANA MORRIS Yeah. 

00:16:40
LANA MORRIS There… we just talked about writing about experience, what I was thinking in the church and so on, but you were also asking them to select bits of text that you came with pre-prepared. 

00:16:55
LANA MORRIS Yes, I mean one of the advantages of this type of activity is there is a huge amounts of scrapbooking, (inaudible) word it is. I mean you can say on just some of these there is pre-prepared quotes quotations, umm… there is slogans, there is umm… that everything that you could want really and part of the… the creative way of putting a picture together is to choose what materials you want, how you want to present these photographs. So, for example this morning John and Leslie(ph) both looked up particularly in inspirational quotes, they actually felt some (inaudible), some of the feelings they had about the photos that they have chosen. 

00:17:40
MIKE SIMMONS Right, right. And it wasn't just text. It was also bits of ribbon… 

00:17:40
LANA MORRIS Yes. 

00:17:45
MIKE SIMMONS …bits of glitter, whatever. 

00:17:45
LANA MORRIS Yes. 

00:17:45
MIKE SIMMONS Like I guess that it's also going to make it more attractive or more eye catching. 

00:17:50
LANA MORRIS Hmm… yes. 

00:17:50
MIKE SIMMONS To the person who might come back to at a later date. 

00:17:55
LANA MORRIS Yes, I mean we… we… we started very simply with looking at producing scrapbook pages. You can't get more complex things like looking at color wheels and looking at what draw… what colors would draw the eye into the photograph itself? What ones word open how to mute the photograph? So it really as you kind of if you want to progress further then there are more complex things you can think about. But for… for… for this and for working people with dementia it's very important to keep things very simply produced if you like or simply creative so was there is some choice, some people with dementia find it very difficult to make choices in which case you know the… the fewer materials you have than the easier would be for them. 

00:18:45
MIKE SIMMONS And I guess there is something, thinking about someone finding it hard to make a choice. Use the helper have got to stand back. Otherwise it starts become your thing… 

00:18:55
LANA MORRIS Yes. 

00:18:55
MIKE SIMMONS …rather than their thing. 

00:18:55
LANA MORRIS Yes. Um… and I think that's knowing the person is the important bet(ph), because you will know when to step back. 

00:19:05
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:19:05
LANA MORRIS And perhaps when you need to support somebody to make those choices. 

00:19:10
MIKE SIMMONS So went to assist, went to facilitate, or went to sat back. Yeah, yeah. One thing occurs to me is that you're trying to create this message in a bottle or something for someone to pick up at later day, you're gonna need to make sure that it stays in one piece. 

00:19:25
LANA MORRIS Yes, yes. When we're creating scrapbooks there are some very practical things to think about. Obviously for somebody who has photographs before 1970, the way in which those photographs were developed and produced would have had a lot of acid and leaking(ph) in the photo development. More recently in recent year you don't have the same amount or difficulty. The reason to being aware of that is those older photos perhaps if you've left them for several years and gone back to them you will find that they got brown and start curling and deteriorating. So if you have photos that are of particular importance, firstly it's useful to scan them in to your computer and then print them off on acid-free paper. But also all these papers that you see on these examples are all acid free. And in addition, all the writing where… where we have done the journaling, we've used pens that are acid free. So it means that they will last, your albums will last for very long time without getting too deteriorated. And the other thing to do is things like these are protected for example. So when you are flicking though them you've got them in plastic protectors so that you can… you can handle them more easily without things breaking or tearing. 

00:20:50
MIKE SIMMONS And acid-free materials, pens and so on you get in for (inaudible) shop. 

00:20:50
LANA MORRIS Any craft stationery shop. 

00:20:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, yeah. 

00:20:55
LANA MORRIS And it was been interesting is looking out the development of scrapbooking in the craft world and there is just a huge range. So many more suppliers are providing to high street stores. All you need to look for with the glues and the pens. It should say either archival safe or acid free and also papers were normally (inaudible) licking free as well. 

00:21:20
MIKE SIMMONS I'm just thinking you're talking about archiving. If you're thinking about printing anything off from the computer that means printer inks and they seem to very hugely in quality. 

00:21:25
LANA MORRIS Yes. 

00:21:25
MIKE SIMMONS And life span and there is something probably about using the manufactures own ink in a printer if you want to guarantee the life of the pictures. 

00:21:40
LANA MORRIS Yes, and I think a lot of the printer inks now will come with the information usually tucked away in the box with hundreds of different languages on it. And I think have you read through those and if in doubt you know just check with the manufacturer whether or not they are archival safe. 

00:21:55
MIKE SIMMONS Right. It felt like you were all haven't quite a bit of fun doing this. But the other thing I was conscious of listening to you and watching you was it felt like they were quite a lot of technical terms and it wasn't just old scissors and bits of scrap paper. 

00:22:10
LANA MORRIS There are some technical terms you just be aware of and it's more again coming from the croft arena. But you know useful because there are loads of scrapbooking magazines out there which will help you if you are interested in setting out your pages and thinking about types of materials. Very basic scrapbooking terms that you'll come across are things like cropping and cropping basically means taking the photograph that you had and cutting it to the size or shape that you wanted it. Umm… So that's the first one. Matting is where you would then place that cut, cropped photographs onto a piece of card or paper just to highlight the photo really. So it's like a border around the photograph. Scrap lifting is not the term that we actually used this morning, but you will see magazine and this is basically where you are allowed to steal other scrap bookers ideas. 

00:23:10
MIKE SIMMONS Plagiarism. 

00:23:10
LANA MORRIS Plagiarism without having to worry about any consequences and in fact it's seen as a very high complement if you scrap lift or you take the design of somebody else's scrap page and copy it using your own photographs. 

00:23:25
MIKE SIMMONS Right, alright it is full (inaudible). 

00:23:30
LANA MORRIS Absolutely, and I think the last term that we did use this morning in relation to these was journaling and journaling literally means writing about the photographs or the experience recalled from the photograph that you have used. Some people do that by putting a date and just saying you know this is John with his dog on March the 1st, 2006. Others will tell you what the experience was you know I felt this was my faithful friend and you know we used to do lots of things together and this is him where he was singing to neighbors or you know just creating a story around the picture. 

00:24:05
MIKE SIMMONS Right and then there are lot of materials. 

00:24:05
LANA MORRIS Yes, there are lot of materials and really the choice is yours. But some of the very basics all you need card stock by that I mean the plain card normally 12 inches x 12 inches which is the traditional size of a scrapbook page and which is the ones that we used today. You can also get 8 x 8 inches and you can get really tiny ones. But if you are starting for the first time, it's always helpful to start with the biggest so that you can see the space on the page and look at how you can create your photographs in way you want to lay them out. There are other things you need such as a pencil or pens, metal ruler if you wanting to cut or, or do (inaudible) within the cards so as cutting out particular frames. 

00:24:55
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:24:55
LANA MORRIS (inaudible) is always helpful if you are using double-sided sticky tape and you will see on… on the piece of film that we had with them. 

00:25:05
MIKE SIMMONS There was a lot of trouble with this hue(ph) tape. 

00:25:05
LANA MORRIS John and Leslie there was few problems with the double-sided sticky tape in trying to peel that away. So traces(ph) are always very helpful. You (inaudible) with both plain ordinary sharp scissors but also some decorative scissors and again you know it's up to you if you want to use those they are very cheap to buy in shops, but they will give you different textures in relation to pictures. You have seen us using ribbons(ph) which were where they come on a plastic sheet and you may see John and I with a lollipop just rubbing them over a piece of card to press the text on the card, we were then putting on all scrapbook page. Umm… (inaudible) source with ribbons you can get adhesive ribbons some are not, so that's where your double-sided sticky tape comes in. And you can use glue if you are not comfortable with using tape. Different color pens, and then embellishments and by embellishments I mean the ribbons we have used brads in some of our pictures today and they are just such a little decorative metal things that you push through the paper and bit like the old (inaudible) where you've open those (inaudible) things at the back. 

00:26:15
MIKE SIMMONS Right. Yeah-Yeah, yeah. 

00:26:15
LANA MORRIS To keep flat and you can get huge range of those in shops. Umm… Obviously, photo paper with… with the photographs might be helpful to have a guillotine or a paper trimmer because sometime that's easier if you're doing with large pieces of paper. 

00:26:35
MIKE SIMMONS The only thing I am just conscious you didn't use glue, you used double-sided sticky tape. Was there a particular reason? 

00:26:40
LANA MORRIS It's just really for ease and speed for today, umm… but the glue that you… if you are using glue just make sure it's white PVA glue and not some of the acidy type glues that you can get. 

00:26:55
MIKE SIMMONS Right, it's back to the impact of the acid. 

00:26:55
LANA MORRIS Yes. Yeah, yeah. 

00:27:00
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. Final thoughts. 

00:27:00
LANA MORRIS Final thoughts are really that you know this can be very enjoyable while spending time with somebody that create something very productive. And also I think most importantly allows you the opportunity really going to know somebody, so if you're working with somebody with dementia who perhaps has got fragmented memories, it's really positive way of being able to spend time with somebody and also the relatives and trying to rebuild a picture of what those memories are. 

00:27:35
MIKE SIMMONS I am conscious is something you said several times I haven't picked up. I have been very aware of this whole message and bottle image. But you also talked about getting to know someone and it feels like this issue of maybe a social worker, health visitor whoever with a service user getting to know them, making a bond with them as well this seemed obviously very important. 

00:28:00
LANA MORRIS Yes, yes, absolutely. 

00:28:05
MIKE SIMMONS Okay thank you very much. 

00:28:05
LANA MORRIS Okay thanks Mike. 

00:28:10
MIKE SIMMONS Right, let's see how this looks in practice. You did some work earlier today with a couple of our colleagues, John and Leslie. So let's have a look at that now. 

00:28:20
LANA MORRIS So have a flick through those and decide you need to cut this piece, a blank piece. 

00:28:25
LESLEY WILLIAMS One of these? 

00:28:25
LANA MORRIS Yeah. 

00:28:30
MIKE SIMMONS So the first thing I see you doing is you want them to pick two different colors, one patterned, one blank. 

00:28:35
LANA MORRIS Yes because this is working with people with dementia one of the assignments that we wanted to get across in relation to (inaudible) was that for some people it's easy if you got contrasting colors or patterns. 

00:28:45
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:28:50
LANA MORRIS Depending on the person's type of dementia will depend on the sort of vision that they have or more than can see and also the senses what they can touch and smell. So what I'm asking them, to my two colleagues to do is to look out you know what's… what's attractive to them and what sort of textures and contrasts that they can bring. 

00:29:10
MIKE SIMMONS You're talking about plain and patterned. 

00:29:10
LANA MORRIS Yeah. 

00:29:10
MIKE SIMMONS What would this two different things be useful? 

00:29:15
LANA MORRIS Again it's entirely up to the person whether they want to use the patterned papers, the background which makes the visual photograph to draw the photo. Did your eye get drawn to the photo or do they get drawn to the paper around it. The colors, so sometimes you can use patterned papers as a border on the photograph to just lift it from a plain background in order that your eyes drawn to the photograph. 

00:29:45
MIKE SIMMONS Yes that sounds like the matting that you were talking about earlier. 

00:29:45
LANA MORRIS Yes that's right yes. 

00:29:50
MIKE SIMMONS And this is I think what you're starting to do, you're cutting up a photograph. 

00:29:55
LANA MORRIS Yes and what we are using here is the sort of the scrapbooking term of cropping. So we are cropping the photograph to make it, umm… yeah look attractive to us and to see you know what is it in the photograph itself that we see is important to be highlighting. This bit now is where we are looking at creating the matting. And so I've used plain paper there and that's my aim to… to make a nice border around that photograph. So when I come to use on my background paper which is patterned, it will standout. 

00:30:30
MIKE SIMMONS Right. So let me get this you might use the plain paper for the matting and a patterned one for the actual background, or you might (inaudible) around the other way. 

00:30:35
LANA MORRIS Exactly, yeah. 

00:30:35
MIKE SIMMONS Just according to taste okay. 

00:30:40
LANA MORRIS Yeah. Part of the enjoyment if this is the creative process so that you know it's you know hopefully you are doing this with somebody to enable them, to retain their memories. So it initiates a discussion with people and it gets some thinking about the importance of the photograph that they have chosen and how they want to present that in their memory album or in their scrapbook. What I like about this is it's very… is universal anybody can be doing this. It's although we focused on it as being a really lovely activity to do with somebody with dementia, you can do with children, you can do as part of tracing your ancestry, you know it's a nice relaxing way and enjoyable. I think the nice thing of doing it with somebody with them with dementia it does enable you to be discussing things with them that help them recall their events. 

00:31:40
MIKE SIMMONS Right so just like a kind of practical process and then there is something else going on underneath. 

00:31:45
LANA MORRIS Yes. But I think what's… what's quite nice looking at this is have you noticed how quite we have all gone. 

00:31:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:31:50
LANA MORRIS In this activity and I think that's also an opportunity where you can be doing an activity with somebody very peacefully and which helps them relax and enjoy the activity. 

00:32:10
MIKE SIMMONS And John now using… 

00:32:10
LANA MORRIS He is using… 

00:32:10
MIKE SIMMONS …the other scissors. 

00:32:10
LANA MORRIS That's right he has got some decorative scissors there… just again it's just for presentation and you know making the page become unique to you to your taste and to how you want it to look. 

00:32:25
MIKE SIMMONS Well, I guess as you have talked about having a lot of equipment, but it also seems to me that you can do quite a lot with very little equipment. 

00:32:35
LANA MORRIS Yes, yes. I mean the… the apps are the basics are some paper, double-sided sticky tape and a pair of scissors and a photograph. 

00:32:45
MIKE SIMMONS And the double-sided sticky tape as we will see is more challenge to some people and others than… 

00:32:50
LANA MORRIS It is indeed yes. It's helpful if you have fairly decent nails but again you can't use other things there is glue. There are glue dots that just peel very quickly, foam pads umm… also so different as long as it adheres to the page that's what you're looking for really. 

00:33:10
MIKE SIMMONS I guess so some pads little… little tiny things you again peel off each side… 

00:33:15
LANA MORRIS Yeah. 

00:33:15
MIKE SIMMONS will actually give more relief. 

00:33:15
LANA MORRIS Lift yes. 

00:33:20
MIKE SIMMONS So you got a slightly three dimensional thing. 

00:33:20
LANA MORRIS That's right. 

00:33:20
MIKE SIMMONS Would we see a disadvantage, is there disadvantage in using glue? 

00:33:30
LANA MORRIS Only you just use it sparingly, I think if you… if you, you can get some very nice umm… paper glues now which have very tips so it means you've got precision where you are gluing things. What… What is grades(ph) with this if you are doing with children umm… and you can make as much messes you like. You know this is fun activity as well as you hope there is something at the end of it. 

00:33:50
MIKE SIMMONS Right, right. 

00:33:55
LANA MORRIS It's… It's mode of doing of the activity that brings the enjoyment and then having something that you can go back on many years to come. 

00:34:05
MIKE SIMMONS I guess from the other side the thing I am aware of that I would think of a scrapbook as being something I quickly glued in various things. So I probably wasn't going to look out very often. 

00:34:15
LANA MORRIS Yes, yeah. 

00:34:15
MIKE SIMMONS And this is more about putting a lot of effort into a smaller number of pages… 

00:34:20
LANA MORRIS Hmm… hmm 

00:34:20
MIKE SIMMONS …to produce something that is going to be looked on. 

00:34:20
LANA MORRIS Yes. So I mean I think anybody that's doing scrapbooking now, I mean scrapbooks I think have always historically been a record of… of events or activities right. 

00:34:35
MIKE SIMMONS I'm noticing that John is also doing something differently. He is actually cutting a round, a particular image within the photograph because you can do just what you want. 

00:34:45
LANA MORRIS Absolutely yes. I mean I think that's the lovely thing once you've got your sort of basic tools your scissors, your glue, your sticky tape and your paper, it's entirely up to you what you want to do with the photograph, how you want to present it. You know whether you want to add more writing on the page to help you recall or whether you want to be pictorial and so yeah entirely up to you how you want to do it. 

00:35:15
MIKE SIMMONS Now what you are doing now is giving them books of… of particular writings that looks like. 

00:35:20
LANA MORRIS Yes. Now there you can get umm… a range of products where you can find the particular quotes from famous people or significant quotes from politicians or so ever and… and it's quite nice to flick through those because sometimes they will capture the essence or the… the memory of the photograph and… and I can't quite recall the quote was that Leslie used from hers, but on John he is doing the picture of the dog and the dog's called Oscar and he has actually got quite from Oscar wild on there, which is a lovely way of linking. 

00:36:00
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:36:00
LANA MORRIS And there is also stuff in… in craft shops things like fantasy fiber for example which is a fibrous material that you iron and it comes out like a sort of textured bit like (inaudible). So I think the nice thing about this is when if you're working with somebody to help them develop their scrapbook, part of the enjoyment is that she is getting out to the craft shops and having a good image. I mean it does become addictive, there is a health warning so you can't get incredibly expensive if you really go for it, but you can obviously do very cheaply, but it's… the whole sort of activity of locating the photographs and going to find you know is there particular theme in that photograph that you then want to create the page and to put the photograph on to. Some people will scrapbook with themes like Halloween or Christmas or birthday or Valentine's Day. Others would do is a chronological event depending on the age of the person running around the way through. Well significant life events that you recall weddings, you know funerals you know all those kind of things could be a garden, particular flowers that you've planted, anything at all, anything at all. 

00:37:20
MIKE SIMMONS And here Leslie is actually looks like she has actually got into writing something herself onto hers. 

00:37:25
LANA MORRIS Yes now that's what we call journaling and that's where you and again it's entirely up to you what you want to write. Some people will just put you know this is the picture in book (inaudible) and the date. Others will say you know this is what we did and this is how I felt about this photograph. So again entirely up to you how much or how little writing you want to put on that. 

00:37:50
MIKE SIMMONS But what are you doing over there? 

00:37:50
LANA MORRIS I'm putting an adhesive ribbon on the bottom of my writing on the bottom of that journaling. And again it's just to give a bit more dimension and a sort of an attractive visual to the page. So when the page is concluded you will have the photograph, you will have a bit of the writing and I have lifted that by putting that… that ribbon across. 

00:38:15
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:38:20
LANA MORRIS Now this that I'm just placing on the pieces is again a quote, this is what we call a ribbon(ph) and it is a piece of plastic. We have do you remember (inaudible)? 

00:38:30
MIKE SIMMONS I do indeed. 

00:38:30
LANA MORRIS But it's a bit like that though the quotes on a… on a sort of piece of transparency and you rub and press down and that will transfer it on to the… the paper itself. So it almost looks as if it has been visibly written on to the page. 

00:38:45
MIKE SIMMONS Right, right. It looks like you are using something special to rub it down with I bet you can use the background(ph). 

00:38:50
LANA MORRIS It was the end of the pen. 

00:38:55
MIKE SIMMONS Oh it really was? 

00:38:55
LANA MORRIS It really was. You can use lollipop sticks and they normally come with the packs that you combine. I think Leslie is just choosing some different paper there. 

00:39:05
MIKE SIMMONS You're still working way on there. 

00:39:05
LANA MORRIS Yeah now this… some of these are fantastically easy, you just sort of literally press your fingers on a (inaudible), it flips away and it's there but this particular one is bit of a struggle you could have put some weight behind it to get that off. 

00:39:20
MIKE SIMMONS And you are now using lollipops. 

00:39:20
LANA MORRIS I'm not using the lollipop stick. I have given with the back of the pen. 

00:39:25
MIKE SIMMONS Right and Leslie is choosing out the pictures that she might use. 

00:39:30
LANA MORRIS Yes and again when you are doing a single scrapbook page, it's quite nice to look at connecting photographs. So I mean say you're at a birthday party and you've got a picture of the person who has got the birthday, you might want to catch up the other photographs in a much smaller but who are all other people at the party so that that will help you. 

00:39:55
MIKE SIMMONS Right to remember the event. 

00:39:55
LANA MORRIS Remember who is there in the event. 

00:40:00
[sil.] 

00:40:05
LANA MORRIS And normally we do this on a slightly bigger table so that you know all on top of which of the cutting photos. 

00:40:15
[sil.] 

00:40:20
MIKE SIMMONS Its nice so this doesn't make one of the (inaudible). 

00:40:25
LANA MORRIS But I think what is great about this is that you… you actually don't need a huge amount of space to… to create your scrapbook and I think the important bit of it is that you can do this on your own, it's nice relaxing part… pastime. But you can also join clubs and groups and do it together, they normally call it some you know a scrap club or crop and people that will come together and literally will be in a room like we are and have been creating their own pages. 

00:40:55
MIKE SIMMONS Really? 

00:40:55
LANA MORRIS Absolutely and that's nice because you can just get to know other crafters, they are a friendly bunch and you know share things, get reviews on different craft products, but it also make… you can talk about your memories. 

00:41:10
MIKE SIMMONS Yes Right. 

00:41:15
LANA MORRIS And talk about the… the photographs that you are bringing. 

00:41:15
MIKE SIMMONS On what they mean. 

00:41:15
LANA MORRIS On what they mean. 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:25
LANA MORRIS Yeah I have also to say here we are totally tidy. Normally when you scrapbooking you get really quite messy and it's very nice. 

00:41:35
MIKE SIMMONS I used to do a lot something like that. 

00:41:40
[sil.] 

00:41:50
LANA MORRIS And it's like Leslie just deciding where on her main page to put her photograph and John is having the same problems with that lollipop stick. 

00:42:00
MIKE SIMMONS Presumably if you haven't got a good craft shop and you buy a this is the kind of stuff you can get only in (inaudible) and so forth. 

00:42:05
LANA MORRIS Its huge absolutely huge and interestingly lots of crafters who… who do scrapbooks will get a lot of materials from America or Holland. 

00:42:20
MIKE SIMMONS Holland? 

00:42:20
LANA MORRIS And very and its very good quality and much cheaper over the internet and some of the shops also for the diehard scrap bookers there are quite a number of crafting events down the country across the year. 

00:42:35
MIKE SIMMONS What does that mean? 

00:42:35
LANA MORRIS It means that everybody who has anything to do with any type of craft will come together so the NEC in Birmingham does it in November and that's where the tradesmen go, those who are creating products or selling products and quite often you get things much cheaply there but saying that you endorsed getting some fortune. But it's great fun because you meet all sorts of people and you know scrapbooking is just one of many crafts that you find and those who are the kind of a committed crafters would also know that they were couple of channels on the cable and satellite devoted to craft. 

00:43:15
MIKE SIMMONS Right. It looks like everyone who has patterned background and then matches on to plain. 

00:43:25
LANA MORRIS It does in this I think probably because that both Leslie and John are new to this. This was their first experience of creating a scrapbook and I think you tend to play safe. If… If somebody says to you pick a piece of patterned paper and pick a piece of plain paper and they tend to follow your lead but I think really this is very individual so the more comfortable you get with using equipment and materials that you've got the more adventurous you become. 

00:44:00
MIKE SIMMONS Right, right. 

00:44:05
[sil.] 

00:44:15
MIKE SIMMONS What's John doing? 

00:44:15
LANA MORRIS John is looks like he is picking out some embellishments which is basically umm… paper clips so perhaps which are those sort of little paper fasteners that you can get and then you can get in different decorative designs, you can get adhesive jewels, get all sorts… 

00:44:40
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. I think (inaudible) kind of moving towards heavy metal probably. 

00:44:45
LANA MORRIS Yes there is quite a number of sort of metal type tags, (inaudible) you know it is funny because you can't suddenly learn at homely language when you start scrapbooking. It will be different things that you can put on your pages. 

00:45:00
[sil.] 

00:45:10
LANA MORRIS Hmm… what next? So there is… there is the adhesive ribbon again. Just using that in different way so we are using that as part of the border and for the photograph… 

00:45:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right, right. 

00:45:20
LANA MORRIS Umm… To see how that might look when you put the photograph on. 

00:45:25
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:45:25
LANA MORRIS Soon we found an inspirational quote. 

00:45:30
JOHN DEERING Yeah but… 

00:45:30
LANA MORRIS And that's the… the page of different quotes that you can use. 

00:45:35
JOHN DEERING Oh never (inaudible) the dog. 

00:45:40
LANA MORRIS I think at that point I was trying to look for a… an appropriate quote for the dog. 

00:45:40
MIKE SIMMONS (inaudible) for the dog. Yes, yes. 

00:45:45
LANA MORRIS I think we were trying to discover whether the dog actually had a banana in his mouth and John was looking for a quote with dogs and bananas. And time wise with this again you can either do it couple of minutes or you can take a couple of hours to design your page and your layout really it's up to you how much time you want to devote to it. 

00:46:15
JOHN DEERING Got the… 

00:46:15
MIKE SIMMONS There is also lots of things. 

00:46:15
LANA MORRIS Yes. I mean the nice thing as well with them you know if you are starting scrapbooking for the first time that you can often get these little bit clips with papers in them, but at the front of the book clip there will be pictures of designs that other people have created from those papers that you can use for your inspiration to start you off. That's the one… 

00:46:40
MIKE SIMMONS And… And now this is John putting in a board. 

00:46:45
LANA MORRIS Yes now this is a little bit of technical tool. You can do it just as easily with a very sharp and scissors and proper hold through your paper and this is where he has just created a hole and he is just now putting his (inaudible) through and at some point he should be flicking the paper over and securing it. 

00:47:10
MIKE SIMMONS There he goes. 

00:47:10
LANA MORRIS That's better. 

00:47:15
JOHN DEERING (inaudible) don't think. 

00:47:20
[sil.] 

00:47:30
MIKE SIMMONS Leslie is (inaudible) John. 

00:47:35
LANA MORRIS Yes I think he is just trying to get perhaps sticky. 

00:47:40
MIKE SIMMONS Very professional on this. 

00:47:45
LANA MORRIS And again you don't have to immediately sort of stick your picture done. You can't just play about with the placement of them and then when you are happy with where they are you can then put them down more permanently. 

00:47:55
MIKE SIMMONS So now there is bit of tidy out going because they got into the end. 

00:48:00
LANA MORRIS Yes that's right. 

00:48:00
MIKE SIMMONS And this is the moment where we usually dump everything back in the box so we can kind of find anything next time or you put it all way neatly I guess. 

00:48:10
LANA MORRIS Absolutely. Yes and part of the funny searching out what you did for this is the last time with scrapbook. 

00:48:15
MIKE SIMMONS So these are the three pages that we are going? 

00:48:20
LANA MORRIS Yes. I mean all very different and again that there will be very different memories of people there. So there is Oscar the dog who does appear to have a banana in the top right hand corner photograph and I think it is interesting about that page as you can it's a page that's patterned actually (inaudible). And so what John has managed to do is lift the photos by matting on to plain paper, but it is quite busy to the picture. So if you look at Leslie's now, now she has chosen Christmas paper so again I don't know if there is a connection there for her in where the one of the perhaps that the lower photograph on the lower right hand side is something to do with Christmas. And then this one again is again very different again on… on sort of paper it is called journaling across it but then lifting it through using different ribbons, plain paper to mat the photographs and brads to just… but you can see there the colors were tone, toning together which has been picked because the picture of the child it has got red. So sort of trying to bringing a tone there in connection. I suppose what I actually say here is that when we have been looking these commenting after we've created them, there is a lot of laughter going on which is the lovely way of sharing you know memories and enjoying the moment and being with other people to share them and I think that's what so nice about creating scrapbooks with people with dementia that you have the opportunity to really get to know somebody through this process. 

00:50:10
MIKE SIMMONS Thank you very much. 

00:50:10
LANA MORRIS Okay, thanks Mike.

The School of Health and Social Sciences at the University of Wales, Newport is developing a wide range of videos and DVDs aimed at counselors and counseling trainers, their students and at anyone interested in developing their use of communication skills. We offer programs demonstrating good practice and bad practice. We give critics of the use of counseling skills and we explore the way in which those skills can be used in a variety of helping settings. Using a wide range of examples in an informative but lighthearted manner we look at the ways in which help and support and counseling can be offered both in face-to-face work and over the telephone. We have also developed a series of programs in which key practitioners discuss their work and ideas and this theory is in common with our other materials has been welcomed by many counseling trainers. Whether you are a trainer, a counselor, a student or someone who uses counseling skills as part of their everyday work, we think that we'll have something to interest you. Call for a brochure or visit our website and see what've got to offer.
