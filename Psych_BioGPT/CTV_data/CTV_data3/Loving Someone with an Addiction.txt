00:00:00
PHILLIP VALENTINE One of the most surprising things about my addiction I said, you know, I won't ever steal or I won't ever lie. And I did both to get what I needed. And so I understand that about people addicted that there, the power of the substance, the power of the addiction uh… is so strong, it's often underestimated. And that personal with that influence would do what they need to do to get their drug of choice.

LOVING SOMEONE WITH AN ADDICTION 

00:00:40

Understanding What Addiction Is 

00:01:25
DR. DOMENIC CIRAULO, MD 

00:01:30
NARRATOR For families who are living with addiction, it's important to understand that addiction is a primary chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and related brain circuitry. Dysfunction in these circuits leads to biological, psychological, social and spiritual manifestations. This is reflected in an individual's pursuing reward or relief through substance abuse. Dr. Domenic Ciraulo is professor and chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychiatrist and chief at Boston Medical Center. He leads a research team that studies alcoholism and addiction. 

00:02:10
DR. DOMENIC CIRAULO, MD 

00:02:10
EXPERT IN DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTION 

00:02:10
DOMENIC CIRAULO Addiction is really a disease of the brain. What happens is we have a genetic disposition to certain kinds of addictions. When this area of your brain, your frontal area which controls executive function and decision making. If that is damaged or different in some way, you may not have the ability to put the brakes on your pleasure centers, so that you tend to drink more. The other part of addiction is during this withdrawal phase, and I'm going to use alcohol just to make it uh… simple. What happens in the alcohol is you get chronic drinking and you get receptor changes. Receptors are the parts of the brain that the liver give signals umm… to communicate to other nerve cells. And during this withdrawal period, there are changes in the receptors that cause this unhappy, dysphonic, this negative feeling. It's during those phases where the brain changes cause a person to drink not to get high, but to relieve this, what some people call this dark side that occurs after chronic drinking. And each drug follows basically those kinds of brain patterns.

SON CHRIS IS STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION 

00:03:30
ROSE MARIE PITTS I have a son who was addicted. I don't know to exactly how many substances, I know he's definitely an alcoholic. It's a disease and that it's, it's taken over his life just like any disease or umm… diabetes or heart trouble. 

00:03:50
PHILIP VALENTINE 

00:03:55
NARRATOR Philip Valentine is the Executive Director of the Connecticut Community for Addiction Recovery. Working one day at a time, Philip has had 25 plus years of sobriety from drug addiction.

CONNECTICUT COMMUNITY ADDICTION RECOVERY 

00:04:05
PHILLIP VALENTINE I do know for me that anytime I use something it was to feel better. And I also know for me that I used to alleviate the fear. So it was very, for whatever reason I had a lot of fear, but when I drank or when I used drugs, the fear went away. And somewhere along the line the substance turned on me. And it wasn't doing what it used to do and it was causing me much grief, much pain, and my life had become unmanageable. But when my life became unmanageable, when I was doing things I didn't want to do to get the substance I wanted, to me that defines addiction. 

00:04:45
Terri and Ken Blackstock 

00:04:45
THEIR DAUGHTER IS IN ACTIVE RECOVERY 

00:04:45
TERRI About 12 years ago, after we sent our daughter to college umm… she began showing symptoms of illness. And we didn't know what was wrong with her. I took her to several doctors. She was throwing up several times a day. Everything about her personality had changed. And later I found out that she had severe drug addiction. I think addiction is uh… when your dependence on a drug goes beyond just uh… needing the drug to it taking over your mind and controlling everything that you do. 

00:05:20
KEN BLACKSTOCK In order to get the high, the consideration of what's being done to your body physically has never factored in. It's just a question of striving for the drugs and lots of drugs do for you psychologically and as physically as well. But, the physical high you get is uh… counteracted by the physical damage that's being done to your body. But the, the drive become so strong that eventually uh… you'll take so many and do so much cumulative damage to your body that it will kill you in the end. 

00:05:50
Traci Creel, addict in active recovery 

00:05:50
BURIED TREASURES HOME INC., MISSISSIPPI 

00:05:50
TRACI CREEL You lose your choice, I know with me when I was umm… drinking, I hated it, I hated drinking, I hated having the drink but I, I didn't have a choice anymore. I mean, I was physically dependent, I had, I had to, I was sick. 

00:06:00
NARRATOR Traci is in recovery at Buried Treasures Ministries in Mississippi. The mission of Buried Treasures is to meet the physical, emotional, and relational needs of women in recovery. 

00:06:10
UNKNOWN Part of the addiction. 

00:06:15
TERRI There's a story in the Alcoholics Anonymous book. The author talks about how addiction is like a person who runs out in traffic and gets hit by a car. And every bone in his body is broken and he is in the hospital for several months with cooperating. And the moment he's released, he goes outside and runs out in traffic again. There's no logic, there's no rationality. That family members usually are just so frustrated by it, because you just want to tell them just stop, just stop. Well, they can't just stop, because they don't have any clarity in their brain. That's when you need to find help for that person. 

00:06:55
RoseMary Bravo, addict in active recovery 

00:06:55
BURIED TREASURES HOME INC., MISSISSIPPI 

00:06:55
ROSEMARY BRAVO Addiction is very easy to, umm… to get into, but it's so hard, it's just like, just letting go and, you know, just put it down, you know. It's hard. 

00:07:10
NARRATOR The disease of addiction is lifelong, yet, very treatable. Without treatment or engagement and recovery activities, addiction is progressive and can result in disability or premature death. 

00:07:20
DOMENIC CIRAULO Addiction is uh… a disease that's never cured. Umm… but neither is diabetes nor hypertension. And it's very important to make it clear that people who could have relapses, and who have relapses it's not the end of world that a treatment uh… is ongoing life time and sometimes it needs to be stepped up. And once you compare it with medical diseases, people feel much uh… less shameful about having this dissymmetry in the family. 

00:08:00

00:08:05
Understanding The Addict 

00:08:05
NARRATOR Education on how an addict may think and function is helpful in understanding the extent of the disease. An addicted person is unable consistently to abstain from their substance of choice. Their behavior, relationships, and physical wellbeing are controlled by their addiction. 

00:08:25
Memory Wilcher, addict in recovery

00:08:25
MEMORY WILCHER Addiction is a real bad sickness and it's not easy to deal with. And if you've never been in that situation, you don't, you really don't truly understand it. 

00:08:35
PHILLIP VALENTINE The mind of an addict that their thinking is distorted. And they think that their substance, their drug or their alcohol is the answer to all their problems. 

00:08:50
NARRATOR John McCollum is a recovering alcoholic. Working one day at a time, he has 13 years of sobriety. 

00:09:00
John McCollum

ALCOHOLIC IN RECOVERY 

00:09:00
JOHN MCCOLLUM Way I view addiction is that some monster inside of me. And when I'm not using, he's in a cage and I have the key. And if I give him just one drink or drug, I'll lock that door and he comes out grabs me by the neck and says, I got you now, again in his own. 

00:09:20
TRACI CREEL In my experience, I know that umm… it was my choice to start drinking and hanging out with the wrong crowd and use prescription drugs. But then you, it's, it's like you lose your, your choice. 

00:09:35
PHILLIP VALENTINE On October 18th, 1987, I stood in the birthing room of Rockville General Hospital holding a newborn baby girl. And in order to get through that experience, I had to have cocaine delivered to me. I was wildly strung out on cocaine. And I believe that was the moment, God used to kind of penetrate my heart and say that, you know, you're not alone you have to do something about this. I do know for me that anytime I use something, it was to feel better. And I also know for me that I used to alleviate the fear. So I was very, for whatever reason I had a lot of fear, but when I drank or when I used drugs, the fear went away. 

00:10:20
TRACI CREEL To use and drink and to, and to do whatever you're doing is, is just a symptom of something else is going on. 

00:10:25
JOHN MCCOLLUM I was addicted. I found myself wanting to quit, but I really couldn't, and I dint know how. So I began to lie and uh… my family changed like they didn't want anything do with me. Friends that I had begun to drift away and uh… the most important thing to became uh… my addiction to bottle. Between jails and institutions for the next 20 years, that was my life. I didn't have anything left, I lost my family, my friends and I was about to lose my life. 

00:10:55
DOMENIC CIRAULO Addicts thinking is different umm… it starts off like everybody else's. But it, it has a term of uh… you know, stinking thinking. Stinking thinking is all of your values get changed. Umm… the highest priority in your life becomes obtaining alcohol or drugs at the expense of family, of work, of depress of feelings and it causes a downward spiral. 

00:11:30
NARRATOR The addicted brain constantly wants the reward of the chosen substance. And addicted individual in most cases does not set out intentionally to hurt themselves or others. It's also important for families to remember that alcohol and drug addiction are symptoms of an underlying problem. Dealing with the disease of addiction is not hopeless, there is help. 

00:11:50
PHILLIP VALENTINE Sometimes, for families there is umm… an action you can take called Intervention. And an intervention is where you meet with a skilled interventionist and you talk about what you want to say and what you want to write. And you write these things down on what you want to say to the person still addicted. And so you have to rehearse that and then you bring the person and the family gets a chance to tell that person everything, their feeling as a very powerful process. It's not only a powerful process for the person addicted, it's a powerful process for the family. I think that's ultimately what people can do, because at least, if God forbid the person dies or the person umm… never gets into recovery, the family knows they had that chance, they did more than most people do. They sat down and had an uh… an intervention. 

00:12:45
NARRATOR The more education and information families can gather about addiction, the more hope they will feel. And the more direction toward help they will obtain for their loved one and the family unit itself.

National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 

00:12:55
DOMENIC CIRAULO There are lots of resources to educate with the National Institute of Drug Abuse and uh… NIH and NIAAA. They're all federal organizations that have extensive information on each drug uh… and on the consequences of the drug. The most important thing is their families really have to take care of themselves. 

00:13:20
ROSE MARIE PITTS Learn, learn, learn what you can about addictions. Join support groups get counseling if you need to. Umm… you may not think you need to uh… I certainly didn't have any kind of regular counseling. I spoke to a counselor of Kristen's(ph) here and there but umm… it's very beneficial for a lot of people. You need people who are in your situation with experienced addictions to be able to unload to. And you need to hear what they've experienced. I've really felt like I've learned so much that way. 

00:14:05
Addiction Affects The Entire Family 

00:14:10
Rhonda Thorton, addict in recovery 

00:14:10
BURIED TREASURES HOME INC., MISSISSIPPI 

00:14:10
RHONDA THORTON As addicts, we let ourselves a lot to, we try to make ourselves believe that there's no one else can hurt, it's just about us. You know, it's no big deal because, you know, it's, it's only happened to us and we don't realize that it's happened to every member. Uh… as for me I have, I have uh… three children and because of my addiction, I wasn't there through all the years of their growing up. I didn't make it to any of the uh… any graduations, anywhere weddings, I missed all that. My oldest son, umm… he told me one time, years ago in my addiction, he said, Momma, he said, "One day I'm going to have a child, you know, and I wanted to be able to bring them to see their grandmother." He said, "And I don't want to have to tell her. No, you can't go see grandma 'cause she's out, you know, doing her thing." There was a slap in the face, but he said that out of love. And I, you know, I, I wasn't even mad, but you know, it was a wake up call. 

00:15:10
NARRATOR Addiction affects everybody in the family. In different ways it affects the marital relationship, the sibling relationship, and the parent child relationship. Each member of the family will have their own recovery journey to take. 

00:15:25
DOMENIC CIRAULO Addiction affects every member of the family not just the person using the drug or alcohol. It will cause a person to do things that they would not ordinarily do. For example, umm… an adolescent who is addicted to oxycontin may start stealing from the family. Umm… the family maybe called into school, there may be problems at work uh… there will be guilt feelings, what did I do as a parent to encourage this or should I have done something discourteous. What can I do know? Those are the kinds of things that affect family. Uh… decrease work time, people have to take time off from work, some people take extended periods off of work, because it's a long recovery process. 

00:16:10
PHILLIP VALENTINE There are many people that usually love the person who becomes addicted. In many cases, the family or the people that love that person have no idea what to do. And sometimes, their behaviors are very umm… positive and would help the person move into recovery. And sometimes, they allow that person to stay addicted longer without even realizing they're doing it. Many times families go to any length to help that person and sometimes it's at the expense of their own health where they become sick as well. 

00:16:45
TERRI I know that when we were going through this, my health suffered. Umm… I have back issues that day back to around the same time that my daughter started uh… descending. And umm… other health issues, you know, that and almost every parent I know who's going through this has health issues. Umm… and, you know, other relationships fall, you start getting really angry at friends who don't understand, who don't get it. And you even have jealousy uh… for families that are that seem perfect. You know, and you think why did they get to have happy, healthy children and I didn't. 

00:17:30
ROSE MARIE PITTS And dealing with the addict are almost like the addict himself. In ain't mad, it isn't obsession to try to make things right with your child, for your child and it takes over your life. 

00:17:45
NARRATOR A loved ones addiction affects everyone around them. Often those closest to the addict feel at fault for the addiction. 

00:17:50
DOMENIC CIRAULO Very often families feel it is their fault. Some will say that they had a problem of their own which then leads you to explore the nature of their problem and how it might have influenced the child. Does run in families and we've known this forever. It turns out that the genetic influences probably the strongest and that it is not anyone's fault. Although parents may have done things to umm… facilitate or you know, enable continuation. 

00:18:25
TERRI Now, there were times when I beat myself up and thought, uh… if I could just go back and relive key moments in our lives and make different choices and it's all my fault. I, I shouldn't have done this, when I should have been whatever I was. 

00:18:45
ROSE MARIE PITTS I felt very much at fault. I felt that I was too harsh of a parent. I still blame myself at times, but it was only through uh… a group that I was helped in understanding that. I did the best that I could at that time. 

00:19:00
TRACI CREEL I would tell their family not to blame their selves either. Because, a lot of, a lot of families think they've done something wrong or, you know, in, in my, in every, everybody, you know, you does things wrong and it's not perfect, but it's, it's not the family's fault. Not for them to having the choice of using. 

00:19:20
TERRI You know, I think it's very important to have a support group of some kind, then you have people who look where you are. And it just uh… it helps to see that they're in the same condition, they're still having the same feelings that you are. 

00:19:35
ROSE MARIE PITTS It's only by educating myself through uh… the group, through NAMI and umm… the books I've read that I've, I've been able to umm… understand that I can take care of this, that he has to take care of it. 

00:20:00
Shame And Stigma 

00:20:05
NARRATOR For families dealing with addiction, stigma and shame can keep them from seeking help. Often, families are afraid of being judged and criticized. 

00:20:15
TERRI The shame was really hard for me at first uh… and the embarrassment. Because, I'm the type of person who even though I have a career that kind of uh… is high profile, I like my privacy, I don't like everybody knowing what's going on with me. And it was so hard uh… when things became public. Umm… for instance, you know, there was a time when police cars showed up at our house. Umm… and then the neighbors knew. When I started working with her trying to help her get help going to AA meetings with her, you know, I, I never thought I would be in an AA meeting. It was just, it was so uh… nerve wracking and kind of embarrassing for me to do that. Eventually, you know, I got to the point where I thought, you know, none of this matters what matters is getting her better. There are people who are going to judge and have their own opinions about how things should be done. And that's fine as long as they keep it to themselves. 

00:21:20
ROSE MARIE PITTS With a son who has uh… addictions and especially in a small town like Jackson Mississippi, I see uh… him on the streets, his daughter sees him. Or he's afraid that she will see him, because now she knows, you know, that he is homeless. You just learn to accept it. But, I really do feel for her because she tries to hide it from her peers. Umm… we went to a parade and she saw him there. And all of a sudden turned him walk the other way and acted like uh… she didn't see him. 

00:22:00
PHILLIP VALENTINE I think there's so much stigma and shame associated with a condition that they're not going to go into their Church setting or their or their doctor. And say somebody is addicted in their family, what do I do? 

00:22:10
KEN BLACKSTOCK The worst thing you can do we've come to find out is to keep this to yourself and, and shame cause you to do that. And there are people who were more than willing and more than capable of sharing with you and counseling you, coming alongside offering very practical advice. So, don't let the trick of shame uh… interfere with your process of getting your loved one or yourself some help. 

00:22:35
TRACI CREEL I'm a nurse and I'm an alcoholic and addict. It doesn't matter if you're educated, white, black, girl, or boy, young, old, it could happen to anybody. 

00:22:45
NARRATOR Knowledge is instrumental, if the stigma and shame of addiction is to be lifted. First, we need to accept that addiction is a disease. Second, we need to understand the factors that lead to addiction and above all we need to recognize that no person is without flaws. 

00:23:05

00:23:10
Common Difficulties For Families When Dealing With Addiction 

00:23:15
Denial 

00:23:15
NARRATOR Denial is a powerful force that helps us handle emotional pain. But by doing this long term, more and more damage is done and the problem just gets worse and worse. It's important to remember that denial harms not helps. 

00:23:35
TERRI Denial is one of the hardest things at the beginning stage of all this, because you see things that you don't want to believe are drugs. You, you just make excuses and, you know, my daughter was, was getting sick. And she, her behavior had changed, she had stopped bathing for instance. She wasn't washing her hair and she was wearing the same clothes for three or four days. And umm… she didn't want to go anywhere. When somebody finally told me for, for sure that she was using drugs and, and that was what was causing all of her symptoms. Then I, I finally had to face it. 

00:24:15
ROSE MARIE PITTS As far as denial goes, it, to me wasn't even a word. At the beginning, I just flat out right, did not see my son as an addict. I saw other people, I saw his wife but I, I certainly didn't say him as the addict. I realized, you know, some of the things he's saying, some of the things he's doing couldn't possibly be true. So I, I feel that umm… if a family member picks up onto uh… something that seems outlandish or less than credible, it's time to put your antenna eye open say. Umm… let's hone in on this and, and look a little closer. 

00:25:05
KEN BLACKSTOCK The most difficult thing we had to deal with was the complexity, the intricacy and the sheer tenacity of the deception. We got to the point where we were being told such fantastic stories. That had someone else told us those stories, we would have scoffed. But, since there was just the uh… just a minute possibility that this was true and it was our job that after brought us to make very, very poor decisions. We gradually learned through some very hard experiences. The, the, to detach was really the loving option. 

00:25:45
PHILLIP VALENTINE Oftentimes when I talk to families, they know in their gut that something is wrong. But, the addict or the alcoholic is telling them a whole different kind of story. And believe me, people who are actively using and wanted to hide that and cover them up can become very skillful and very manipulative and can lie beautifully. It's an incredible skill. So when I get a little cynical with somebody who's getting the runaround I say, "How do you know when an addict or an alcoholic was actively using his line?" And they say, I don't know, oh, that's a good question, I said, their lips are moving. So I mean that's a little extreme but it kind of gets the point across that, really shift everything that they're saying with a grain of salt. You don't have to go around and check everything but confront the person directly and say things like, "I don't believe you." 

00:26:45
UNKNOWN I think probably, the most important thing for families to know is that it can happen to anybody and don't be in denial about it. 

00:26:50
KEN BLACKSTOCK Denial is death when it comes to addiction. 

00:26:55
NARRATOR You are neither the cause of your loved ones addiction nor will you be the cure. But, you can choose to face your denial then you can choose to get help for yourself. 

00:27:10
Enabling 

00:27:15
NARRATOR Another common difficulty for families healing with addiction is the propensity to enable their loved one. The definition of enabling is providing the means or opportunity making possible, practical or easy. 

00:27:30
DOMENIC CIRAULO Enabling that is trying to help a person and actually doing something that harms them. For example, umm… if somebody is drinking heavily say, a father in the family is drinking heavily and is running out of booze. And says, I'm going into withdrawal and asks his daughter to go out and get booze. So that he doesn't go in to withdrawal. She may feel that she's helping him, but actually those are the times where intervention is very effective. 

00:28:05
PHILLIP VALENTINE Some of the common pitfalls over covering up for the, the person who got in trouble. You lend them money to bail out, you give them a place to live, you talk to their employer. So you're trying to cover up. 

00:28:15
TERRI I thought I was not enabling my child, but it turns out that I was because I would do things like, pick up the pieces when her life fell apart. That didn't make it hard enough for her, that didn't make her remember where she had fallen, it didn't make her remember how severe her consequences were. And I had to break my addiction umm… in Al-Anon, they do teach you to go through the 12 steps as if you were an addict. And I think that's very helpful for some parents to do. 

00:28:50
JOHN MCCOLLUM My family would lie and do things like, give me money. That was the biggest thing they would let me come home and lay up a drink. I was married, I was sober, but my wife was an addict. And I tried to do all the things that I used to do to my mom. I cover up for her and make up stories why she couldn't be somewhere and tell hours why she couldn't go to work. That was enabling her to continue doing what she was doing. 

00:29:20
PHILLIP VALENTINE I think a family has to be able to let go enough to let the addict face the consequences for what they've done. Whether that's jail whether that's umm… getting fired or getting kicked out of school or losing their place to live. Because, those consequences are the things that helped me get into recovery. 

00:29:40
TRACI CREEL I've always liked the saying that you can love an addict to death. You can do so much for him but it's, it's slowly but surely killing them. You have to hear about them or you'll never come up. 

00:29:50
NARRATOR There are practical things that families can do to avoid enabling their loved one to continue in addiction. And that will help their loved one into a place where they can choose recovery. One of the major things for families is learning to detach with love. 

00:30:05
TERRI It helped us too when we learn to detach. Umm… I think that was a turning point for me when I realized that I could help her umm… with responsible choices, but not help her with the same old things I was doing before. Paying her cell phone bill, paying her uh… house, you know, her rent, paying her utilities, helping her free up whatever money she might have working umm… to buy drugs. One of her counselors told me early on, if you give her money, you're, it's like signing her death warrant. You know, a parent would lay down their life for their child. At some point, you have to realize that pulling back is probably the best approach. 

00:30:45
ROSE MARIE PITTS You have your life to live. Uh… apart from a lifestyle that is not something that you want to be a part of, but that your loved one has chosen. You've just become exhausted. It gives you time to pause uh… and to step back, detach if you uh… want to say. And umm… and look at it from a different viewpoint. 

00:31:15
RHONDA THORTON My family, whenever I was in my addiction they, they had loved me, but they loved me from a force. They didn't come to my rescue when I picked up the phone and said, "Hey, I'm out here in the mail," you know, the street, you can't keep rescue in an addict. I mean, they've got to deal with what's going on. You know, all you can really do is pray for 'em and, and when they come on their own for help, you know, be there for them when they finally realize that they need some help. 

00:31:40
KEN BLACKSTOCK You love differently and that you, you make different choices. And you realize that if I am to love this person, I've got to quit enabling them to destroy the rod. It takes recognition, because most of what you do at the start of this process is instinctive. You just rally to support in our case a child. Or any loved one you, you, that's what we're to do, that's how we're designed. And what you have to work yourself into is, understanding that I'm not helping I'm only prolonging. And unless there's a change of, of method, unless there's a change of tactic, no lessening of love, no, no lessening of desire for wholeness to be restored. But, changing the way we interact with that addict it's, it's nothing will change. 

00:32:35
PHILLIP VALENTINE There's always comes a time when you have to leave the person or let the person do what they're going to do. And that's really, really hard. I don't, I don't say that lightly. I've seen people that you never think would, would recover get into recovery. I mean, years, decades of active opiate addiction, heroin addiction, alcoholism. And then something clicks with them and they get in recovery and the process starts. I guess for families, it's always a question of umm… when to let go. To let the person struggling take you down as well and take the rest of your family down as well. I believe with all my heart that I got in recovery, because I know of at least one person who loved me dearly that never stopped praying for me. And that's my grandmother. And she didn't confront me a lot, she didn't really umm… address the issue, but I found out later that she prayed for me every single day. Is there anything more powerful that you can do for a loved one? I don't think so. 

00:33:50
NARRATOR Here are some practical tips for detaching with love from an addicted loved one. Don't provide money. Don't pay bills, fines or expenses. Don't pay loans. Don't cover up in life for the addict. Don't make excuses. Don't do things for the addict that they should be able to do when sober and clean. Don't lend or give things that an addict could then sell. Set boundaries. It takes time to become aware of the ways we enable the addict in our life. But perhaps, with the information we have just heard, you can begin to remove the factors that are causing you and your loved one more harm than good. 

00:34:40

00:34:45
Fear 

00:34:45
NARRATOR Ultimately, when dealing with the addiction of a loved one, our greatest fear is that they will end up dead. This fear keeps us running, putting out fires and trying to preserve the life of our loved one until we end up completely exhausted and depleted of life ourselves. 

00:35:05
TERRI When you're experiencing this kind of thing uh… you do find that your, your whole life is centered around fear. Because, you're so afraid you're gonna get that phone call and, you know, something horrible is going to happen. I just felt so depleted of energy and strength, because I just was going from one fire to another. And it just was so exhausting. Umm… and, and fear did rule my life, because I was doing things that I shouldn't have done uh… in order to keep her safe. Like, I was going into areas of town that I shouldn't have gone in. I was umm… I was just doing things that were not the norm for me just trying to rescue her. 

00:35:55
KEN BLACKSTOCK But you also have fears of what this going to do to our marriage? What is it doing to our marriage? What is it doing to our other children who are not addicted and who is, who are losing the, the focus that should be given to them in their careers and their lives? And what's happening with them? While we're so focused on this addicted child? What if this makes us bankrupt? What happens to our careers? What if somebody else finds out? What if this child gets addicted in a, in a, in a stupor that does an injury to someone else? The fear is from the gamut and, of course, the, the, the loss of the addicted person isn't certainly the most important, but fear is probably the, the, the bedrock of addiction for those who are dealing with the one who's addicted. So it, it, it comes in all shapes and sizes. 

00:36:45
ROSE MARIE PITTS Fear was very dominant emotion. For years that's the way I functioned, on running from one crisis to another uh… trying to help, thinking oh, we've got to stop this from becoming the crisis. It looks like it's going to be. And uh… it, it's uncontrollable. 

00:37:05
TERRI I finally learned after many years of it that I can't rescue her. And umm… someone, someone very wise told me, uh… don't deprive your child of an encounter with God by rescuing her from her pain. And it, it took me a long time to really understand what that meant. And umm… I think it was kind of freeing for me when I finally was able to understand that God was going to deal with her, if I let him. 

00:37:40
ROSE MARIE PITTS I would say that umm… it's a, it's only by understanding, who is controlling the whole picture? God, that you realize how finite you are in this whole thing. But, it's been a process it's not something you just come to right away. 

00:38:00
NARRATOR The life of our addicted loved one is out of our control. In this regard, having a loving relationship with a higher power and the God of our understanding can be of great help in alleviating the fear and anxiety that come with addiction. 

00:38:20
Grief 

00:38:25
NARRATOR In the midst of addiction, grief emerges in reaction to the intense changes taking place in an individual and in a family. Dreams are crushed, hope is elusive. The person we once knew is lost to the addiction. 

00:38:45
ROSE MARIE PITTS An addiction puts a family into the grief process. It's a loss of your loved one to a completely foreign world. 

00:38:55
TERRI It's the death of your dreams for your child. You know, I had plans for her instead what happened is, all those dreams died. And the dream then became, "Let's just get her sober, let's just help her to start over." You go from one emergency to another and it's, it's like death occurring over and over and over again. And it's so easy when they seem to be doing well, to think, you know, the dream can possibly come back and then it's killed again. 

00:39:30
KEN BLACKSTOCK The opportunity for grief comes repeatedly. We are to take that just on a routine basis when it comes to addiction. So something that you grief, you, you deal with uh… just as part of that process, you kind of avoid it. 

00:39:45
ROSE MARIE PITTS Both my husband and I have been so caught up in this. I don't think I realized how I was alienating uh… even some of my friends. Uh… even your best friends don't understand uh… something like this. You find out who your, your best friends are. Uh… but eventually, you know, they get tired of hearing the same thing over and over and your family members too. 

00:40:15
NARRATOR Whether it's a partner, sibling, parent, or child who is addicted, grief comes into our lives and we can feel very alone. Understanding and accepting this process of grieving, will help in the recovery process. Finding support through others who are in this grief process is an important step to take. 

00:40:40
TERRI I realize that, you know, for a long time I kept it secret from my friends, I kept it secret from family members. I wanted her to be able to get over it and go back to her life and nobody ever knew what happened. But eventually, I realized I needed help, I needed prayer and I needed uh… people around me. 

00:41:00
KEN BLACKSTOCK One of the most cathartic moments that that happened for us was, was bringing this before a Sunday school class. Uh… and just telling them point at blank what was happening with us, with our family, our emotions. We quite pretending that we've had it all together.

TERRI And for those who can't find a support group, Alcoholics Anonymous has a, a group just for families called Al-Anon and that's a real helpful uh… place to go and those are all over the country. So, you can usually find one of those.

00:41:45
Hopelessness 

00:41:50
NARRATOR Hopelessness and despair present themselves in Technicolor for families dealing with a loved one's addiction. Living with addiction can put family members under unusual stress. Normal routines are constantly being interrupted by unexpected or even frightening kinds of experiences. The entire system becomes absorbed by a problem that is slowly spinning out of control. 

00:42:15
ROSE MARIE PITTS I felt the most hopeless when I saw my son on the streets. When I had to take my son and leave him on the streets originally, I knew that he couldn't keep living with us. We were going to be moving and it was just the perfect time to say, "Okay, Chris, you need to be out on your own." He refused to go and the house was sold. He refused to get out of the car when I want to take him some place. So I had to go to the police station and the police tried to talk him into it and that didn't work so back to the car we go and then downtown. And uh… you know, putting him out on the street, that was probably when I felt the most hopeless. 

00:43:05
[music] 

00:43:10
ROSE MARIE PITTS And… 

00:43:15
[music] 

00:43:25
TERRI There were so many times when I would just get down on my knees and just cry out to God and say, you know, what are you trying to do? Why have you let this happen? You know, I thought we were supposed to have the desires of our heart. You know, and you knew my greatest desire was for my children to be healthy. And umm… it's just so hard. 

00:43:50
NARRATOR There is hope in the midst of addiction, hope that recovery is possible. Hope comes from meeting others who share a common experience and with whom you can find support and a belief in something greater than ourselves to intervene in our lives and in the lives of our loved ones.

DOMENIC CIRAULO Help for an addicted loved one is really readily available. Nowadays, the first thing to do is to talk to your primary care doctor. And they are very skilled and know how to refer and how to follow. There is a website at the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism that will help find treatment. There is the same system at the National Institute of Drug Abuse. One of the things that's important is the knowledge that someone has of Alcoholics Anonymous umm… and uh… Al-Anon in their area.

00:44:55
Recovery Is Possible 

00:45:00
NARRATOR Finding support from others who are experiencing similar situations is invaluable to a family's recovery. 

00:45:10
TERRI I think it's very important to have a support group of some kind, then you have people who look where you are. It helps to see that they're in the same condition they're also having the same feelings that you are. And it just helps you to blow off steam, it just helps you to release that pressure valve. 

00:45:25
JOHN MCCOLLUM So families need to, to find a group, find a place that they can feel safe, that their anonymity would be in for inch down. They come together and share these things with each other. That way sure in them, it brings light to these uh… struggles. 

00:45:45
TERRI I think prayer is a huge component and it really open my eyes when I realize. At times when I was praying for her and the God was working. Addicts often lose their glasses and their contact lenses and, and things like that. And she, she had uh… lost a contact lens and she almost legally blind without it. And uh… didn't have any money to go to the doctor and get a new prescription. And she was walking down the side walk and literally found a contact lens in a uh… a little package, you know, like you get at the doctors. And it was not quite her prescription, but it was very close. And, you know, that told me that God was answering my prayers, He was working in her life when I couldn't see it. And umm… you just have to trust that that's happening behind the scenes. 

00:46:35
PHILLIP VALENTINE Hope for me just stands for hang on peace exists. And if I didn't have hope, I don't think I ever would have got well. I knew that I was living a life that was wrong, it was unhealthy, it was causing destruction. But, I also knew that there was some way out, I just didn't know what it was. In the last 25 plus years, working one day at a, at a time, I've really found a power greater than myself that has restored me to sanity. My whole outlook and attitude upon life has changed. Umm… I'm grateful for each and every day. I believe God is the source of my strength and my hope today. 

00:47:20
NARRATOR The road to recovery for families and their addicted loved ones is a related but separate journey. Each member of the family has to work through denial and come to a point of acceptance that they are powerless over the situation that their lives have become unmanageable and that they need help. 

00:47:35
DOMENIC CIRAULO The family approach is really umm… approaches really teaching, what is helpful for the person and what is not helpful. So for example, a father may feel very guilty about hospitalizing a daughter. And the daughter may say, I'll never talk to you again for hospitalizing me. So, the family is there need support saying that's not going to happen that this is the best thing for her and the best thing for you. And you go through that line supporting, the really positive moves that definitely makes. 

00:48:10
TERRI I can't say there is one moment when I realized I needed to recover. I, there were actually several moments, because dealing with a, a loved one with addiction, it's almost like you're going around and around and around a revolving door. And you keep running into the same things over and over. There were times when I was uh… doing better longer. The longer this went the, the better idea. 

00:48:40
KEN BLACKSTOCK You get to the point where you're just you're worn out. And you realize that this person is going to continue to use us and abuse us as long as we will let them. We just said, "This is enough, we can't continue to do this, we can't continue to rob our other children, we can't continue to rob our, our church family, our, our, those are friends." When you get to that point, it takes a while, it takes a long time, but you will get there. And uh… I think that the addict sees that, they'll see that, you know, oh, you're not rescuing me now, you're not coming, you're not doing as how they ask you to do, they, that is part of the training process. 

00:49:25
PHILLIP VALENTINE A thorough family recovery is about love, communication, care for one another. When I think of my family I think that uh… I know they're there for me always. And I can think of no greater gift that they love me no matter what. And I think that's enhanced, because I'm in recovery. The God forbid if I was ever to relapse. I don't think they'd leave me, they might treat me a little differently, but I don't think they'd leave me and that's, that's really good to know. 

00:49:55
NARRATOR For an addict to begin the journey of recovery, they must break their own denial and come to accept and acknowledge their addiction themselves. No one can do this for them. 

00:50:05
KEN BLACKSTOCK You have to come down to the, to the point where you can, where you understand that regardless of the help that you've offered, regardless of the programs, regardless of the therapy that eventually, it comes down to an individual choice, that person has to stop using drugs. 

00:50:30
RHONDA THORTON If you force them it's not gonna, it's not gonna amount you anything, they're just going to go right back to where they were. Uh… my family, I was committed several times for drug abuse and I was so angry with them for doing it that it did, it absolutely did nothing. You know, it just got me sober for a while and, and then when I got out and went right back to what I was doing. 

00:50:50
PHILLIP VALENTINE It's estimated the 10% of the population has an alcohol, drug problem. And so also estimated that, that there are 23.5 million people in recovery in the United States, that we hardly ever hear from. What a powerful block of people and we're just starting to come out if you will but are facing recovery and let people know that recovery is real. 

00:51:15
NARRATOR Addiction is an incurable disease, but it is very treatable with education and support. Families dealing with addiction can learn to live their lives to the best of their ability with hope, grace and a belief in a power greater themselves to intervene for their loved one. 

00:51:30
DOMENIC CIRAULO I can tell a person that the disease is chronic and relapsing and people recover. However, that is not as effective as group therapies or Alcoholics Anonymous. I think the best treatment for that is to go to meetings, go to as many meetings as possible, listen to stories of recovery and get involved in the program. And that's the best way to address the feeling of hopelessness by seeing other people, in hearing other people story of recovery. 

00:52:10
TERRI Our daughter has been drug free for a while now. We are seeing her making good choices and the things that I had given upon, relationship with her, or having normal mother daughter times with her have come back. It's still like walking on eggshells, because we been through so many relapses that we, I think we constantly wait for the other shoe to drop. But the longer it goes, the more comfortable we get. And umm… and now we, you know, we do try to help her with when she's making responsible choices. And not help her when she's making irresponsible choices. 

00:52:45
KEN BLACKSTOCK To accept and celebrate small victories. We all want a miraculous healing. In our case that hasn't happened we're in the process of healing as far as we can tell. But, we celebrate daily the things are better, they're not what they were they're not what we want them to be but they are better than they have been. 

00:53:10
PHILLIP VALENTINE In order for a family to truly care for their loved one who might be addicted or is addicted, they have to be able to tell the truth without blame or judgment. And so tell the truth as they see it. I see that your, this is really hurting you, I see that you are missing work, I see that your school is, is being affected. Whatever the situation, you tell your truth as you see it and don't blame them or judge them. And that's the real key, you have to come from it with a real place of love, concern, care, compassion. 

00:53:50
UNKNOWN I think family support is probably one, well, it's one of the most important parts of recovery. I know in, in my situation that, that this would not be going as well as that if I didn't have my family support. 

00:54:05
JOHN MCCOLLUM Addiction is so bad on the family members, because they can't do anything about it. They've done everything they know and nothing seems to work. In their brokenness somewhere God might say, "Hey, I'm here for you too. Not this too big for me and I do love you." 

00:54:30
ROSEMARY BRAVO It always helps to umm… kind of like talk it out with, with your family member that is using, because it's got to be something else that's making them turn to the drugs. 

00:54:35
RHONDA THORTON One of the biggest blesses that drug addict can have is a family that truly, truly loves them and is praying for them and is, is longing for them to come home. 

00:54:40
ROSE MARIE PITTS I do not need to be in this, yeah, I can give encouragement, yeah, I can say I love you but I, I don't have that hopeless feeling anymore, I can't. I have every hope for him. 

00:55:00
NARRATOR Find and hang on to hope, learn all you can about alcoholism and addiction. You are not alone. The choices you make for your own wellbeing are the best thing you can do for your loved one.
