TERESA GARLAND Jeffery came into the clinic in tears. His world had come apart. He always gets a snack on the way to therapy and it is always Rold Gold Pretzels. Today they were out. And mom gave him a choice of a different brand of pretzels or Goldfish crackers. He doesn't like Goldfish crackers. And he doesn't like the other pretzels. Mom was sorry, but firm. Jeffery melted. He had cried all the way to the clinic. And now he was limp from crying so hard. He came with me into this small room in back of the gym. I hung up a gentle swing, gave him headphones with some calm music. He got into the swing with the headphones on and soon was quiet. I let him be for a few minutes and then checked to see if he was okay. He was. I knew that we had to take it easy for a while and so suggested a quiet game on the floor. And then we did some work. I had the luxury of working in a sense-free clinic with just the right equipment. And so the job of calming Jeffery was not difficult. If only our real world's situations could be handled so easily. But in fact, as we soon will see, there are many ways to calm a child and to help a child stay calm that can be done anywhere. Talking about calming begs the question. Should we wait until a child has gone out of control before we work to calm them? Of course not. We want the child to be more resilient and grounded, so that he or she doesn't need the on-the-spot calming. And there are things that we can do to help the child grow in this way. Hello. My name is Teresa Garland. And I'll be sharing a collection of techniques for calming children of all ages, with and without autism. Any child can have a bad day, but some children in our lives and in our practice regularly struggle with self regulation and calming. Annie is in constant motion. Raoul(ph)just had a meltdown. Andre has trouble falling asleep. Maggie(ph) is easily angered. And Sean is wiggly. These children have different types of problems, but they all have difficulty calming. And they all have difficulty staying calm. Kids like to feel calm. They may act out, but they are glad to reset and get their brains and their bodies steady again. We can help them by facilitating calm activities and teaching them strategies to stay calm. We can also adjust their environment, give them fidgets, work on eating and sleeping habits, look for times and places for them to get rigorous physical activity. In the next hour, we'll look at videos showing numerous methods that can be helpful. Sit back and enjoy the program we've created for you. 

00:04:45
CALM ENVIRONMENT 

00:04:50
[music] 

00:04:55
TERESA GARLAND What does a calm environment look like? First of all, it's uncluttered. It's hard to quiet the mind in a busy or a messy place. Second, it's quiet. It has soft colors and a simple design. Indoor plants and fountains, or posters of nature scenes can help make the setting more relaxing. Children like to be calm, but sometimes they don't know how to get to that spot. You can turn many busy environments into calm environments by simply dimming the overhead lights, pulling down shades and playing soft music or nature sounds. Consider letting a child lie on a mat or in a quiet corner. Have them sit on a comfortable chair or a beanbag in school with his head on his desk, so that he can close his eyes and reduce the sensory input. 

00:05:55
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 

00:06:00
[music] 

00:06:10
"Animal Walks" 

00:06:10
TERESA GARLAND It's important that children get physical work through play and exercise. Physical activities make a child's muscles strong and keep their bodies calm. The child with autism often times does not participate in play and misses out on the natural opportunities to make his body strong. The actual work of child's play is an important way for him to burn off stress and anxiety. So it has the effect of not only tiring out the body, but settling the nervous system and calming the emotions. Getting a regular dose of heavy work in the form of play and exercise will help a child to stay better regulated throughout the day. In fact, for the child with autism, we tried to put movement breaks with heavy work or stretching into the day whenever possible, optimally, every two hours. Better yet, if the child is actively involved twice a week in a sport like karate or swimming or into gymnastics for an hour at a time. The grounding effect of the heavy work should carry over into the next day or two. And you will see a child who has much better self regulation. Our videos show us young children learning how to use play equipment. Notice that they need help learning where to place feet on the rock wall and how to place hands on the monkey bars. Most children will figure this out on their own or learn it from a friend. But the child with autism may need your help sorting it out. The beauty of teaching the child with autism, how to play on playground equipment, is that they do indeed learn to love it, to run to it and use it just as any child would, once they've learnt how much fun it is. Animal walks are an easy way for a child to get some heavy work with play during the day. At some point, the older child could accompany his parents to the gym and begin an exercise program. This will help to keep the child grounded as school work gets harder and social demands do, too. Start out slow, so that the child is not overwhelmed. And then ramp it up to a 30 minute set of exercises and weights. Don't forget chores as a way of helping to strengthen the muscles and ground the self with a child with autism. Start at a young age and watch the skills and the calming improve with time.

CALMING AFTER EXCITEMENT 

00:08:50
[music] 

00:09:00
SPENCER WALKER 

00:09:00
TERESA GARLAND How do we bring an excited child back to earth? A little heavy work or deep pressure will usually do the trick. We'll look next at techniques useful for calming small children and follow that with techniques for older children and young adults. Our friend's Walker and Spencer offered to demonstrate a couple of techniques for us that make use of deep pressure on the child's body to help with calming. When we get anxious or excited, we become more aware of our emotions and excitement than that of our body. Deep pressure makes us acutely aware of our body. And this in turn grounds us. It also helps to release whatever energy went into the muscles as part of our excitement. Would a hug or shoulder squeezes work well? Sure. Let's look at Walker in the "Hot Dog" game. We're gonna make you into a hot dog. So here's the bottom bun, here's the hot dog. Here's the relish. Here's the mustard. Here's the ketchup. And, here is the bun. Two, three, four. Did you like that? 

00:10:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:10:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:10:20
"Deep Pressure with a Therapy Ball" 

00:10:20
TERESA GARLAND This is easily done on a soft mat or with couch cushions. Here is Holly and Spencer demonstrating use of a therapy ball for deep pressure. Holly asks Spencer if he wanted the ball on the front side or the back side. And then asked which part of his body he wanted the ball on. When Spencer had had enough, he asked, "Done yet?" It's important to follow the child's direction with interventions like these. Our next clip is of Holly and Spencer demonstration the "Burrito" or the sausage roll. 

00:10:55
"The Burrito" 

00:10:55
HOLLY HAMEL How does this feel? 

00:10:55
SPENCER Not that good. 

00:11:00
HOLLY HAMEL Not that good? 

00:11:00
"Using a Weighted Ball" 

00:11:00
TERESA GARLAND Spencer agreed to do the Burrito for us. But midway through, Holly discovered that he didn't actually care of it very much. He didn't mind being rolled up but he didn't like the sustained pressure. It's important to ask, as Holly did, if the child likes it. And to look for signs, like Spencer's gritted teeth, showing that it was a bit too much for him. Some children crave that deep pressure. Others like Spencer have less tolerance for it. Playing toss with a heavy ball with a child is a very easy way to get her calm. As a rule of thumb, use a one or two pound ball with a two and half year old child with autism. A third grader can handle about five pounds. And the older child can handle much more weight. Check that they are comfortable catching the ball and that the effort moves them a little with the effort. Typically, you'll see that they bend their knees. This exercise is perfect for small spaces and just a few tosses is usually enough. 

00:12:10
WEIGHTED BALL TOSS: 

00:12:10
Stand close together 

00:12:10
Use 5 pound ball for a 3rd grader 

00:12:10
Use 1 or 2 pound ball for a 2 1/2 year old. 

00:12:10
30 seconds is often enough to get calm! 

00:12:15
[sil.] 

00:12:20
TERESA GARLAND Here's how to do "Hookups." Put your arms out facing the wall. Cross them at the wrist. Then lace the fingers and bring them up in front of you. Cross your legs and then put your tongue on the roof of the mouth and hold that for a minute. Then, undo all that and reverse it. Again. Put your arms out in front, cross at the wrist. Place the fingers. Bring up the hands in front of the chest. Cross the legs and tongue on the roof again. Hold that for a minute. And if the child is particularly antsy, have him squeeze. There is a way we can modify those hookups, so that they can be used by the older child throughout the day. The child is going to cross-wrist and lace fingers, but instead of taking them up, she will leave them down in front of her. Cross her legs and then squeeze. Switch sides and squeeze again. Now she'll move her arms round to the back, leaving her legs together and squeeze. Switch arms. And squeeze again. The beauty of this exercise is that no one knows that the child is doing a calming exercise. It looks completely normal, but it is a nice symmetric exercise and it actually works. 

00:13:55
SOFT MOVEMENT

"Theraband on Chair Legs" 

00:14:10
"Swings" 

00:14:10
"Lycra Swing" 

00:14:10
TERESA GARLAND Soft movement calms us, from babies to grandparents. Rocking chairs, glider chairs and swings can give us soft rhythmic movement and provide a gentle rest from our activities. Some children crave movement. Therapy balls and wiggle cushions provide imperceptibly soft movement that can stimulate our vestibular sense and keep it calm and reduce that craving. In a classroom setting, or at the table with homework, a wiggle cushion or a therapy ball can make the difference between out of the seat, poor behaviors and focus attention to the task at hand. Therapy balls and wiggle cushions have been shown to help about 50% of children with movement problems. 

00:15:00
[sil.] 

00:15:05
TERESA GARLAND When the balls and cushions don't work, it may be that the child needs body input rather vestibular input. Some wiggly children can satisfy movement cravings by pressing their legs against theraband tied to their chair in the classroom. Theraband is easy to try. And will satisfy some of the wiggly children in your setting. 

00:15:25
"Swings" 

00:15:25

"Learning to Manage Energy" 

00:16:30
TERESA GARLAND In this next video, I am pushing a child in a lycra swing. Lycra swings are quite magical. The stretchy Lycra completely supports the child's body. And the interior of the swing is quiet and dark, and the rhythm of the swing's movement provides an additional element of calming. "Rhythmic movement is especially helpful for an excited child or a child in distress." Note, how I keep the swing moving in a slow, steady motion. Often I will count as I pull the swing back and forth, enforcing the rhythm of the movement. Just a few minutes of swinging is usually enough for a child to achieve a sense of calm. But continue for longer, if the child is working her way through heavy emotions. Our last clip with Walker was in fact a short clip of an intervention I did with him to settle down. Now, lets' look at the entire intervention with Walker. 

00:17:30
HOLLY HAMEL I'm so nervous(ph) today. I'm so excited. 

00:17:35
WALKER May be I'm a puppy. May be I'm a puppy. 

00:17:40
HOLLY HAMEL What's that going there? 

00:17:45
WALKER Puppy! 

00:17:45
HOLLY HAMEL You want to keep doing it? This is fun. Walker, we'll take care of drinks after we're all done with routine. 

00:17:50
WALKER No, but I am thirsty! 

00:17:50
HOLLY HAMEL Okay. 

00:17:55
WALKER I am stuck! 

00:17:55
HOLLY HAMEL Walker, let's go. Let's go, you're all the way through. Go, have a seat so your next friend can go. 

00:18:05
TERESA GARLAND Be careful. Are you paying attention? 'Cause if you don't pay attention, you'll fall on the floor. Okay, paying attention. Oh, good attention. Oh, okay. Calm, do you think you're getting calmed? Are you calm? Walker was overexcited and silly. I played a game with him that I found to work with a lot of children. I move them back and forth in terms of energy levels with fast then slow movement. Are you calm now? 

00:18:35
WALKER No! 

00:18:40
TERESA GARLAND Are you excited? Yeah? I watched them to express the excitement and then to get to a calm state. I found that when I do this back and forth activity with a child for five to 10 minutes a day, one or two days a week, their brain learns how to make an automatic adjustment when they need to get calm. In other words, they learn to self regulate. 

00:19:00
WALKER Miss Holly, guess what? 

00:19:05
HOLLY HAMEL Yes, Walker? 

00:19:05
WALKER (inaudible ) this snowball.

"Sensory Tools" 

00:19:35
"Chewers" 

00:19:35
"Weighted Boa" 

00:19:35
TERESA GARLAND Sensory input is perhaps the biggest reason that children with autism have difficulty staying calm. Many children with autism are oversensitive to sounds and touch. A fire alarm can cause one child to scream. And cutting nails or hair can cause a meltdown. But sensitivity can work two ways. A child who doesn't tolerate being touched may touch everyone else because it feels good. This is called sensory craving. Sensory processing can get very complicated, very fast. How does one keep a child with sensory sensitivities and cravings calm and self regulated? We'll look at that in this section. For the child who is sensitive to sound, occasional use of ear muffs and earplugs may be the perfect solution. If the child refuses to put ear muffs on, desensitize them by using headphones. Plug the headphones into the family TV or a DVD player and tell the child that he can hear the sound to his favorite cartoon by putting the headphones on. Demonstrate it to him. He will learn to tolerate the headphones in a short amount of time. Once he's successful with the headphones, earmuffs should be much easier. Ear muffs, ear plugs, headphones and ear buds can increase the chance of getting an ear infection. So if the child is prone to ear infections, you will want the parents to get their pediatrician's advice before making use of these items for more than a few minutes at a time. Here is Shane. He craves the touch of the drum and rubs his fingers on it whenever he is in the music room. Doing this is very calming for Shane and so his teachers give him the opportunity to do so on a regular basis. It's a good practice to let sensory children play with sensory items periodically as a way of staying self regulated. 

00:21:40
[sil.] 

00:21:50
"Rhythm, Drums" 

00:21:50
TERESA GARLAND Here is Shane again playing with rice bin filled with toys. Notice how he enjoys the texture of the rice, the way it looks as it falls. He may also enjoy the gentle sound of it falling back into the box and also the sound of his own voice as he plays. A good sensory tool, like the rice bin, a bean bin or a sensory box which we'll see next, can provide all kinds of sensory stimulation and be the perfect way for a child with autism to relax. A good sensory box will have toys and other items that provide pleasant inputs to the hands, the eyes, the ears, and the nose. Note that we've included touch fidgets, cotton balls with vanilla, a baggie with dried orange peel, an iPod filled with calm music and ear buds, a kaleidoscope, theraband for tugging, and soft pipe cleaners. Some children like the sensation of vibration. And so including an item like a vibrating frog into the sensory bin might be a great idea, too. For children who are "chewers," provide them with food-safe items for chewing. This boy has a "P" clipped to his shirt, so that a safe chewy is easily available to him. "Ps," "Qs," "Ts," chewable bracelets and necklaces are available in many therapy catalogues. Make sure that the items are made of FDA approved materials. Here is Spencer playing with a "Weighted Boa" scarf. Spencer is a fidgetor, and the boa is a perfect fidget for him. It keeps his hands fully occupied, so that he's not tapping them on things. We'll talk about the weighted property of the boa in the next segment. In terms of overall calming for a distraught child, the most effective method I know is this music. It is Sacred Earth Drums by David and Steve Gordon. The music makes use of calming rhythms, deep vibration, which is very calming, nature sounds, and a beautiful flute. Its effect on a tantruming child is quite dramatic. In my experience, most children calm within 30 seconds of hearing the music. By the way, one form of music therapy makes use of big drums. The children learn to play them and keep a steady beat. The therapists tell me that it appears to keep children calm and that they love it. 

00:24:40
USING WEIGHT 

00:24:45
[music] 

00:24:55
[sil.] 

00:25:00
If the child wears the weight (backpack, vest or blanket), the weight should be heavy enough to make the muscles work. 5-10% of his/her body weight is a good amount. 

00:25:00
A child should never wear more than 10% of his/her body weight. 

00:25:00
TERESA GARLAND Using weighted equipment is a form of heavy work. The child works against the weight and reduces their excitement, stress, and intensity motions. We'll look at a few different ways of using weight on the spot with a child to help them settle. Here are a couple of rules for working with weight. It needs to be heavy enough to actually make the child work, but it should never be more than 10 percent of the child's body weight. Let's take one more look at Spencer with the Weighted Boa. This is the perfect fidget that keeps his hands busy, but it also provides him with heavy work. 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:26:05
"Weighted Ball" 

00:26:10
TERESA GARLAND We talked about playing toss with weighted balls, earlier in the DVD, when we demonstrated ways to help an excited child to calm. Here's an easy way to effectively use a weighted ball with a small child. Let's look at the ways that working with weighted balls can be built into the child's stay in the classroom or in the clinic. In the first video, the teacher, Julie, is having children use the ball both as a talking stick and as a calming weight. 

00:26:45
JULIE BROOKS Good job. Okay, nice, Spencer. Put your hands up. It is heavy. Pick it up. 

00:26:50
SPENCER I'll drop it. 

00:26:50
JULIE BROOKS (inaudible ). Look. Eyes on… Good morning. Good morning, Spencer. 

00:27:00
WALKER Good morning. 

00:27:05
JULIE BROOKS Good job. Okay. We'll get your (inaudible ). Hold on. Put your hands out. Okay. Good morning. 

00:27:10
WALKER (inaudible ). 

00:27:15
JULIE BROOKS Okay. And now you're gonna give it back to me. Oh, good. Who are you giving it to? 

00:27:20
TERESA GARLAND In this next video, the therapist is using the ball as a way to transition back to class after having had a workout in the gym. The heaviness of the ball draws the child's attention back to their bodies and helps to ground them. Note that the over-the-head movement works the entire upper body. 

00:27:40
[sil.] 

00:27:45
TERESA GARLAND A "Weighted Blanket" is a common way to help a small child calm. In fact, many children will come up with their own weighted item solutions to calm themselves. For example, some children like sitting with their backpack on their lap or wearing a heavy coat inside of a building. Speaking of backpacks, it's a great idea for a child to walk to school with her backpack on, providing that the backpack weighs less than 10 percent of her body weight. Why 10 percent? OTs and PTs worry about skeletal issues, if children wear more than that amount. 

00:28:30
USING BREATH 

00:28:35
[music] 

00:28:40
"Correcting Shallow Breathing" 

00:28:40
TERESA GARLAND Breath is the ultimate calming tool. It's free. It's rhythmic. And can be manipulated for instant calming. Who hasn't used three deep breaths as a way of getting back into a self regulated state? This is the perfect solution for the child who is angry, ready to melt, or who is overexcited. Three breaths are enough. Too many could of course cause hyperventilation. Now let's turn to the topic of shallow breathing. Some children are shallow breathers and breathe into their chest rather than into the belly. Chest breathing pull in less oxygen than stomach breathing does. It is thought to result in anxiety problems. It can also lead to an increase in panic attacks and sometimes to pneumonia later in life. You can easily check a child's breathing method by having him place a hand on his belly as he breathes, while looking to see if his hand rises and falls with his breath. If it doesn't, he can learn to breathe correctly using this same method. Let's watch Lawrence as he does this. 

00:30:00
[sil.] 

00:30:05
"Back Breathing" 

00:30:05
LAWRENCE 

00:30:05
TERESA GARLAND Here is another exercise that I found can help strengthen the intercostal back muscles and reduce anxiety. Breathe into right there. So try and take a breath. Lift your head up. Just breathe normal, but heavier breath. Touch that spot. I'll feel it. Oh, yeah. See my finger going in and out. Yeah, that's perfect. Okay. Perfect. It is typically done while the child is lying down on his back, and can be done upon awakening each morning. Lawrence demonstrates, for us, while standing up so that we can see the effect. 

00:30:45
"Breathe and Look Far Away" 

00:30:50
TERESA GARLAND Here is one last way to calm with breathing. It helps to reduce the tension at the brow and is especially useful for older children who want a way to calm without anyone noticing. Have the child stand near a window or with a long view down a hallway. Have them look as far into the distance as possible, while taking one long deep breath, that's it. The brow will relax and the tension in the face will dissolve.

MEDITATIVE TECHNIQUES 

00:31:30
[music] 

00:31:40
Mind Jar 

00:31:40
RECIPE 

00:31:40
1. In a jar with a good lid combine equal amounts of glycerin (or corn syrup) with dish soap 

00:31:40
2. Add a tablespoon or two of glitter 

00:31:40
3. Shake the jar to see how long it takes for the glitter to settle 

00:31:40
4. Add more glycerin to make it slower. Add soap to make it faster. 

00:31:40
"Mind Jar App" 

00:31:40
"Ice Cream Melt" 

00:31:40
TERESA GARLAND Here are some fun methods for helping to achieve calm attention. You can make a Mind Jar, by making a 50-50 mixture of glycerin and dish soap in a glass jar with a good sealing lid. Add some glitter. Shake up the jar. And see how long it takes for the glitter to settle. You can make it settle faster by adding a little more dish soap. Or you could slow it down by adding a little more glycerin. Have the child gently shake the jar and watch the glitter fall. Use it as needed or every day as a calming break. A variation on the Mind Jar is an iPod, iPad, iPhone app of a Mind Jar created by Wisdom Publications. We look at it more closely later on. Here is a fun visualization that can help a child settle into his body and get grounded. The child first imagines he has ice cream on the top of his head that drips all the way down to his feet. After that, he pretends he's a tree and roots himself into the ground. Imagine that you have a large scoop of ice cream on the top of your head and that it is melting. Feel the ice cream as it melts down your face. It comes down your cheeks, runs down your nose, over your mouth.

"Grow Tree Roots" 

00:33:20
TERESA GARLAND It comes over your ears and onto your shoulders. It continues to drip down your arms and over the front of your chest and down your back. It flows down past your elbows, onto your wrists and is soon flowing down your fingers. At the same time, it's coming down your legs. In a little bit, it reaches your knees, the front of the knees, the backs of the knees, dripping down your shins. It hits your ankles, your feet. And then ends in a puddle on the floor. Now, feel the bottoms of your feet, the soles of your feet. Feel them all prickly. Imagine that you're standing on the ground outside. And now you feel on the soles of your feet. You feel little roots start to form. The roots are very small, but soon, they start to grow. They grow longer. Oh, my. They're an inch long. They're starting to plough through the grass and into the soil of the earth. As they grow, they push into the earth and they branch. And they move in all directions, just like roots do. But some of them keep moving down. Your roots are growing. They're one inch, now two inches, getting longer, and longer, and longer. They continue past the soil and now into the harder earth. And they're big and thick and firm. And you feel very rooted, like a tree with roots in the ground. Your roots are very deep now. They're longer than six inches, my goodness. They're about a foot long. Test your roots. Try and wiggle your feet. Will they move? With a bit of work, see if you can lift up your foot, and then the other. Take a step, and then another step. Does this make you feel calm? Keep your roots for as long as you are able to, and grow them again whenever you feel anxious.

CALMING FOR BEDTIME 

00:37:00
[music] 

00:37:10
"Stretching Before Bedtime" 

00:37:10
"Electronics and Bedtime" 

00:37:10
TERESA GARLAND The most important way to improve sleep habits is to set up a routine so that the body knows it should be tired, and the brain prepares to fall asleep. A routine like toys away, taking a bath, putting on pajamas, snuggling into bed, and reading a story or a book can help children of all ages to find sleep. But wiggly bodies and alert brains can defeat sleep. Wiggly bodies may need some stretching to settle down. When you stretch the muscles in your body, you release energy built up in the muscles, and let the muscles relax. Some gentle stretching or yoga can be very effective in helping the body to become quiet. Here are some simple stretches that will help to relax most of the muscles in the body. Eight to ten seconds is usually enough. Consider doing two sets of them for the very wiggly child. And why not make this a family routine with mom or dad joining in? By the way, you don't need to limit stretches to bedtime. If they are done throughout the day, they will help keep a wiggly body quiet. And consider getting a book or app of children's stretches or yoga poses, so that you have a variety to choose from. Here is the Cobra pose. It stretches the chest, arms, legs, and neck. Here is the Bow. It continues to work on the chest, but stretches the opposite arm and leg muscles. Downward Dog stretches the back and the hips. The child pose flexes many of the muscle groups. This is a particularly relaxing and good pose to end with. Brains can become alert with excitement or from the use of electronics up to 90 minutes before bedtime. The excitement of what's playing as well as the sound and the blue light that is emitted from electronics can not only alert the brain but it can reset the brain's Melatonin cycle. Eliminate electronics 90 minutes before bedtime or at the very least, monitor the content for excitement. Dim the brightness of the screen and turn down the sound. 

00:39:45
[sil.] 

00:39:50
TERESA GARLAND One last element of bedtime calming is the bedroom itself. Make sure that the room is dark and quiet, and that the bed clothes are comfortable and not scratchy. 

00:40:00
TRANSITIONS FROM ONE ACTIVITY TO ANOTHER 

00:40:05
[music] 

00:40:15
TERESA GARLAND Getting a child or a group of children with autism to transition from one place to another, one person to another, or one activity to another takes a little planning. In the U.S., children with autism are trained in an early age to follow the sequence of activities in a picture schedule. And it works. Making use of a picture schedule or a visual schedule is the simplest way to affect transition with a child with autism. Task for the day are represented in picture form and listed in the sequence that they are to be done. Children see the list and understand what the plan for the day is and what is expected of them. So on a simple day, the visual schedule should suffice for transitions. But not all days are simple, so it's important to have a good repertoire of transitioning techniques. We're going to look at several here. In the first, a therapist uses carpet squares as a way of keeping order in the gym. She has the children move from one location in the gym to another by having them move their carpet squares. The children have done this before and they know the method and comply. All of them, that is, all of them except for William, who is new to this class, have figured this out. Notice how the class follows the order and see how William tries to conform with the help of his aid, Holly. In this video, Stephanie has the children get ready to leave the gym using a weighted ball. We discussed the importance of the weighted ball earlier. We know that its weight is important, but so is the ritual that it is a part of. The process of passing the ball back frees up the child to stand and be ready to go back to class.

00:42:35
LANI 

00:42:35
TERESA GARLAND There are many, many methods that people use to help a child with transitioning. Here is series of videos showing a few common methods. In our first video, little Claire brings her favorite thing, her little shopping bag with her, as she comes into the gym. She's asked to put it aside to park it. In this next video, we transitioned Lani back to her class using a song. She knows this song but often times, we just make it up on the fly. 

00:43:10
UNKNOWN What's our song? Mrs. Smith's Class? 

00:43:10
LANI Mrs. Smith's Class. 

00:43:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, okay, let's sing that. Here we go to Mrs. Smith's class, Mrs. Smith's class, Mrs. Smith's class. Here we go to Mrs. Smith's class, all through the day. Here we to Mrs. Smith's class…

"Asking the child to help" 

00:43:30
COOPER 

00:43:30
"Using an object of transition" 

00:43:30
TERESA GARLAND How is it that a psychologist gets a child who needs some testing to come with her to the test room? Here's a segment in which Cooper shows us how it's done. I go to get Cooper with my big stack of materials and ask him if he'll help me carry them. He says "Sure." And in fact, kids with autism like being helpful. Cooper helps to carry the materials, and the heavy load keeps him calm as we walk to the test room. A novel way for a child to return to the classroom after having a fun activity is for them to bounce a ball, ride a tricycle, or ride a scooter board. 

00:44:10
ENCOURAGING CALM 

00:44:15
[music] 

00:44:25
TERESA GARLAND Let's take another look at the video of children moving their carpet squares. And this time, focus on how Stephanie calls out the good behavior set she sees. It is important to catch the tiniest bits of good behavior and those act out as a way of giving them positive attention. 

00:44:45
STEPHANIE RAMSER We are going to line up by that back door. So I want you to lift up your carpet squares. Good job. (inaudible ) bad fall where do we fell and after rang on We'll just slide out right on this flight. I'll show you. Right here. Spencer, good job. Right here. Spencer (inaudible ) There you go, Helena. Nice job. Trevor, good job. (inaudible ), are you ready to come sit on a carpet square? 

00:45:15
"Proactive Use of Stars" 

00:45:15
Tell the child the rule and then immediately reward compliance 

00:45:15
TERESA GARLAND A good teacher, like Julie, tries to stay ahead of the game. She is training two new boys, Walker and William, to behave well by noting all of their compliant behavior and rewarding them frequently with stars. The other children have already had their training in good classroom behavior. And they wait patiently, if a bit perplexed, by the effusion of stars for those two boys. It will all settle down soon enough. And in fact, just a month later, Julie saw this video and noted just how different her class was now. 

00:45:55
UKNOWN Mom, I (inaudible ). 

00:45:56
JULIE BROOKS Oh, I'm so glad to hear that. With a quiet mouth. Walker earns a star. He raised his hand with a quiet mouth. What's your question, Walker? 

00:46:10
WALKER Well, I was, if that word, is that word is Miss Holly, then it will? 

00:46:15
[sil.] 

00:46:20
JULIE BROOKS If that word is Miss Holly's name is up there? Okay. We have one more question and then we're gonna start circle. William, you had your hand up with a quiet mouth. What's your question? 

00:46:30
WILLIAM My question is, I want to do, uh… the weather… 

00:46:35
JULIE BROOKS You want to do the weather. Well, we'll do the weather… 

00:46:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:46:41
JULIE BROOKS We'll do the weather in a little bit. 

00:46:45
"Overcoming Fear" 

00:46:45
TERESA GARLAND In this next video, Trevor is afraid to go through the tunnel. Stephanie encourages him to do so, but does not insist that he do it. Instead, she finds a way to grade down the fearful challenge that it presents to him by having Holly show him the end of the tunnel. 

00:47:00
STEPHANIE RAMSER Trevor, go through the tunnel? 

00:47:00
TREVOR No? 

00:47:05
STEPHANIE RAMSER Yeah, let's try it. 

00:47:05
TREVOR I don't want… 

00:47:10
STEPHANIE RAMSER Let's try. You know what? Holly, if you can go to the other end of this and open it up. It's okay, Trevor. Holly's gonna be at the other end. William, you want to show him how. 

00:47:15
TREVOR I want to get to that hole. 

00:47:15
STEPHANIE RAMSER Okay, go down, look down. 

00:47:20
TREVOR No! 

00:47:20
HOLLY HAMEL Hey, Jim, go. 

00:47:20
STEPHANIE RAMSER Go through. Got see, Go see Miss Holly. Go, go, go. 

00:47:25
WILLIAM It's a dream my? 

00:47:30
HOLLY HAMEL Look at buddy? 

00:47:30
WILLIAM (inaudible ). 

00:47:35
HOLLY HAMEL Woo-hoo! Good job. That was great. 

00:47:40
STEPHANIE RAMSER No, Miss Holly. Go have a seat, okay. I'm right here. Keep going. Use that muscle going 

00:47:50
"Encouraging Independence and Control" 

00:47:50
TERESA GARLAND William works hard to climb up the ramp and does it on his own. The only help Stephanie gives him is to block him from slipping down. William being new to the class has not done these activities before, and he imitates all the others who have gone before him including Trevor, who was afraid. Stephanie notes that he's not really afraid and pushes him through to an easy completion of the task. 

00:48:15
MANAGING TIMEOUTS 

00:48:20
[music] 

00:48:35
TERESA GARLAND Timeouts don't have to be disciplinary. Think of them and have the child think of them as a way to reset and be quiet for a minute. Pick a quiet spot. Give the child explicit instructions on what quiet behavior means. And then set a timer for a short amount of time. But all behaviors have consequences. If the child acts out during the one-minute timeout, or reset period, the timer starts again. A very gentle form of a reset or a timeout is to use a Mind Jar. Here is Lani getting a quiet time with the Mind Jar iPad app. 

00:49:20

00:49:25
MASSAGE THERAPY 

00:49:30
[music] 

00:49:40
TERESA GARLAND Our final segment is of Heidi giving four-year-old Sammy a massage. Massage is the ultimate calmer. The deep pressure on the muscles pulls tensions out from the body and leaves the child completely free from stress. We'll show an entire massage as it could be done by a parent. But consider a 15-minute head and shoulder massage like those found in a community setting, like a shopping center. One mom I know, of a 16-year-old boy with autism, stops with him at a local place once a week for a head and shoulders massage. She says that it helps him to manage his anger. Now let's watch Heidi and Sammy. 

00:50:25
[music] 

00:50:30
SAMMY 

00:50:30
TERESA GARLAND Massage is a very important type of deep pressure. Notice how Heidi is really into the muscles and how she stretches them and pulls them taught.(ph) 

00:50:45
[music] 

00:50:50
TERESA GARLAND She is helping to pull the energy out of the muscles as she does that. And by doing it, it takes the wiggles out of a child's body. 

00:50:55
[music] 

00:51:25
TERESA GARLAND Heidi does that sort of thing on all the muscles of the body and doesn't leave out the head or the earlobes. She pulls and tugs on the earlobes. She rubs and massages the head. 

00:51:40
[music] 

00:52:00
TERESA GARLAND Fingers and toes are equally important. Heidi pulls on the fingers as she stretches the muscles, releasing all the tension. And slowly, Sammy begins to relax.

On-The-Spot Calming 

00:55:05
TERESA GARLAND So the massage is done and Heidi asks Sammy how it felt. He can barely answer her. Clearly, it was a wonderful massage. I asked him later what he thought of it, if he'd want another one. "Oh, yeah," he said. We've learned a lot in the last hour. Let's take a quick lock back and see what we've learnt. I've included techniques for the clinic, the classroom, and for home. Here are some of the key points. Keep a focus on what will work in your environment. Here are few ways to get On-The-Spot calming.

00:58:10
