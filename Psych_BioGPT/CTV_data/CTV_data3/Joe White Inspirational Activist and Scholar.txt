Thomas Parham presents A Discussion with Dr. Joe White Professor Emeritus - UC Irvine Dr. Thomas Parham, Ph.D. Assistant Vice Chancellor Director, Counselling Center - UC Irvine 

00:00:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Hello, I'm Dr. Thomas Parham, assistant vice chancellor for counseling health services and director at counseling center here at the University of California, Irvine and it's my pleasure to welcome today an individual who has been a very important individual and dynamic personality in the field of psychology and counseling over the last several decades and we've come to a place where he has spent a good portion of his career here on the campus of the University of California, Irvine. To interview this similar thinker, social activist, clinician, academician, and scholar, Dr. Joseph L. White. Dr. White, welcome. 

00:00:50
Dr. Joseph White Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Psychiatry - UC Irvine 

00:00:50
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Thank you, Dr. Thomas. It's good to be here. 

00:00:50
DR. THOMAS PARHAM It is nice to have you. Uhm, in this interview we'd like to take a retrospective look at your life, some of your work, lots of your career and have you shared with the viewers, uh, both some things you think that are important but also some messages that you'd like to leave them or we, as they will be viewing this and their academic departments and their community centers, uh, maybe in the privacy of their own home. So why don't we begin by briefly describing for us both your background growing up and what led you to pursue a career in psychology. 

00:01:30
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Well, let me separate the two, ah, the background in growing up and what led me to pursue a career in psychology. I'm from a single parents ah, family with two siblings. Mom, high school graduate, ah, raising three children alone back in the 1930's and 40's, ah, and ah, we lived in Minneapolis, Minnesota where there weren't very many what was called at that time, colored people or negroes. So for the first 17 years of my life I was sun burnt Swede, okay? And, ah, growing was fantastic. I loved growing up but there was one problem and that was I looked all around me and all the decision makers in the community, the police, the school teachers, the mayor, the president of the bank, the people who ran the newspapers, that was all white and yet I was being told that this is America and you could accomplish anything you want and every black boy of my generation went through the same discovery. Now I had heard words like contradiction, prejudice, discrimination but I didn't know what they meant. So I re, reacted with both anger and fear. So my mama grabbed hold of me one afternoon and heard I've been cursing and this and that at white folks about this whole thing and she set me down after dinner and she told me that the way I was gonna make my way in the world was to make something from nothing. I would never forget it. It was like it was yesterday. And she called me by my full first name because she would have come to Jesus meeting with her children- (crosstalk) 

00:03:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Yes. 

00:03:15
DR. JOSEPH WHITE - when they had ah, violated to ruthless, shall we say. And so I was getting ready to challenge her about this something from nothing because when she said it, my mind went immediately to my arithmetic tables. I was twelve-years-old and zero plus zero equals zero, zero minus zero equals zero. You can't make something from nothing. And she said, "Boy, I know what you're thinking. I know how your mind works and since you doubt me, you're gonna sit out under that tree for an hour a day." This was in summer time and figured this out how to make something from nothing. Now she could have told me but she was trying to give me a Zen riddle where I would have to struggle with the answer and I couldn't solve it through logical thinking. So it took me 13 years to figure out what she was talking about. And from that came the first two premises or rules of black psychology, first two themes are improvisation, making something from nothing, being resilient, being creative, being innovative and the second thing was being resilient. And how I discovered what she was talking about, when I was 25, I believe, I didn't get into graduate school the first time around and I was gonna walk away from psychology and go to law school with my friend, Willy Brown, and I was, went by her house one afternoon and we were drinking gin and eating hot peppers and she was, kinda, light skin sister, she was part Choctaw Indian. So I told her I was getting ready to the law school 'coz Willy had talked to the dean and I had the grades and everything and she said, "You're just gonna walk away from psychology like that?" I said, "Well these white folks won't let me in." She asked me, "Well how many graduate schools did you apply to?" And it was the way she said it, there was something in her tone and I look to her and I said one but my mind was already racing. It said to me, "Look, there's more than one psychology Ph.D. program in America." I'd only apply in Berkeley 'coz I lived in San Francisco- (crosstalk) 

00:05:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Uh hmm. 

00:05:15
DR. JOSEPH WHITE - and it gently dawned on me what she was trying to tell me that somewhere there is was a Ph.D. for me with my name on it but I would have to go and find. (crosstalk) 

00:05:25
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Uh hmm. 

00:05:25
DR. JOSEPH WHITE It wasn't all coming to me. 

00:05:25
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Uh hmm. 

00:05:25
DR. JOSEPH WHITE And that was making something from nothing and bouncing back. So that's the way the childhood, that was the childhood foundation. 

00:05:30
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  So as you look back on your, your childhood and adolescence in particular and then moving into being young adult, what factor is it in, in people most influence you? 

00:05:40
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  Well I think the people that most influence me was, of course, my mother, was a profound influence 'coz I saw her how she would have to work and keep things organize, buy the groceries, get us clothes, this and the other. So she gave me an example of what you can do when you make up your mind you'll gonna do. 

00:06:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Uh hmm. 

00:06:05
DR. JOSEPH WHITE And I don't care whether to walk through the snow or buy some coal or whatever. She influence me a great deal and then there was a man at the community center down the street, a neighborhood house they used to call them, and I got been out of shape one time because I was going to this summer camp and I was one of the two black boys going there to the summer camp, and that was my last time, I was 13 and I was a junior camp councilor with the nine and ten- year-old boys and I had won the runner up award of the best camper the year before. So this last summer I was determined I was gonna be get this award so I ran the newspaper, I counseled the younger boys, I coached the basketball team, I did everything, you know, that I thought I planned this skit on skit night and they gave this award to another boy and I knew I had that award in the bag and my mother told me, "Son don't count your chickens until they hatch." And when they announce that award that night, I got mad. And so I held on to myself then after everybody went to bed, I went out in the darkness and I cried and I cursed. And so then I boycotted the community center when I came home. I said, "These white folks saying they're gonna give me this award." And it was a race (inaudible ). So then the director who was a white dude called me and, he called me with my mom and, ah, we went over the business about the award and he said, " Now we're gonna tell you why this other boy got the award. His father died, his mother has a drinking problem, he's trying to look after four younger brothers and sisters and he needs this award to lift him up and you don't need anything. You got everything, your mother is sitting there, she loves you, you're popular, you got everything going and God didn't give you all of these skills for yourself. You were put on the shirt to help other people and you will get yours whenever the time comes." (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Uh hmm. 

00:08:00
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  And so that had a profound influenced on me 'coz it kept saying, "Don't you be worrying about yourself, you weren't given everything, you've been given talent, good looks, popularity just for yourself." And so then that clean that up. So those were two things, one, my mother and the influence of this man, when he set me down and he just broke it down to me. 

00:08:25
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Uhm, it reminds me of that old African proverb that talks about, life at its best is always a creative synthesis of opposites in fruitful harmony. And so in that, out of the pain of not receiving award, one of the most valuable life lessons that then helps to launch you to compel you will live to the rest of you,- (crosstalk) 

00:08:45
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Yeah, I end up with a bigger award. 

00:08:45
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Yeah, yeah and that's something. You talked about the disappointment in not getting it, thinking about making a clear change, your mother saying, "Uh, uhm, Joe, don't abandon the dream. You apply to other places. Get in to Michigan State, decide to attend. You conclude your graduate training in Michigan State, 1961 I believe, becoming the first African American Ph.D. in clinical psych from that institution, I can't remember which is pretty phenomenal back in the day and one of the few, only in the country. What was that like for you then and what lessons does your experience teach to today's students of color who are pursuing graduate degrees? 

00:09:30
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Well, as I answered that question, let me back up a couple of ways, psychology fascinated me. Ah, I backed into college as a C student and I was sitting in this class and the first thing the professor did, he talked about Pavlov and that dog. And when I saw that dog salivator, he told a story and then they serve the meat and then they rang the bell and pretty soon they wouldn't even need to serve the meat anymore. They would just ring the bell and the dog would salivate. And to me, I said, "Now that's the way they program white folks to hate black people." They talked bad about them, put a bad mouth on them and then as soon as you see a black person, you say dumb, over sexed, ah, can't do a complex task. You don't need to say it anymore, I mean, 'coz it's in your brain, in your pre-conscience. I said, "So that's the way they work this game." And that just fascinated me, then the next week he talked about Freud and the subconscious mind and the unconscious and the defense mechanisms. And I said damn to myself, that means somebody could look straight at something and not see it, denial and repression. I said, "No wonder they can't see how they've been mistreating folks." I said this stuff is for real boy and so I went and saw my adviser. And I, same thing, as I had been doing in high school, C plus, B minus sometime, the boy, I was a sophomore, the man took a little old, a paper, piece of paper out and he showed me the GPA I would have to have for my last two years to even get a shot at graduate school. He says, "You gonna have to become an A student almost to graduate with a B plus average." He said, "Besides, there's not many colored people in psychology anyway." So from then on, since it fascinated me, nobody had to tell me to go to class, study with the A students, read extra books, this and that, participate in discussion groups, ah, exam groups and this and that. So my grades went from C+ to A in one semester- (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Hmm. 

00:11:35
DR. JOSEPH WHITE - and then I graduated with the highest GPA that a, any student ever had in Psychology Department in the major. So first one thing and then another happened but I go to Michigan State, so because I didn't get in the first time around, once I decided to stay in psychology, I got a masters. But in the masters degree, I took everything they had that was research oriented, statistics, history systems. So I actually planned the first year Ph.D. program while I was in the masters even though the masters was clinical. So when I got to Michigan State, I go in to see my adviser, John Herly(ph), and I bring in the same book that they're using in intermediate stat I had at San Francisco State. I showed him my exam, A, A+, history systems, showed him that and I asked for this waiver of these classes and I knew what he was gonna say, I knew he's gonna say no. So he looked at me and he told me two things. You're gonna get a Ph.D. from this institution, you have to take these classes and number two is negroes generally have trouble with abstract mathematical thinking like advance statistics. And I said, "No problem, it didn't bother me any." So then he put me in the same classes I've already had, history systems, experimental psych, ah, and statistics intermediate. So I've had the class once, so I blow the whole thing away. There's the curve is way out there and there's me way out on the end. So then they called me and tell me and they waive just about everything. I was only in Michigan State three years and I did everything including my internship and on top of that I became the TA in statistics okay, and I'm in clinical. So, uhm, the academic part of graduate school was not that hard because I loved it and I told my wife nobody is gonna outwork me. So if I drive by the psych building, I see the light on in the graduate reading room, I would turn my car around in that snow, call my wife from a pay phone and say I'm gonna stay here to these other graduate student left(ph), nobody's gonna outwork me. Now the problem began to come up mostly in my subconscious because the people in the graduate school said, "Well, this is the smartest little negro we ever saw in our life." I wasn't smarter than nobody, I was just over prepared- (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Hmm. 

00:14:05
DR. JOSEPH WHITE - and they didn't realize even after I showed them that I had all that preparation, they thought it was raw ability. I, I was not smarter than any graduate student, but white folks are stupid, you know, that they couldn't figure that it was the preparation that got me over. But anyhow, while I was in the graduate school, every now and then I would begin to think, you know, this thing is going too smooth, you know, I got married, I got two wonderful children and then the third girl was born, you know, this is the American dream, something is not right around here and we didn't go off campus too much 'coz they wouldn't allow us around there. So it was Malcolm X that begin to stir my subconscious because he would come over there to visit his brother who was getting a masters in social work and he would talk to us and he would tell us, you know, that you'd just gonna be the man's Dr. Uncle Tom, Dr. Nigger(ph) and this and that out there, we would argue back and say no, we're the talented tent(ph), that's what we are. We are the white man's favorite Negroes. He chose us to be the ones, we're the next generation, you know? But he said, "Na-na-na-na-na, when you get out away from around here, you're gonna run into America's son and you're gonna be in a world of trouble." So I tried to push that out of my conscious mind and think you know, "Hey, I'm gonna be alright. Everything's looking good and so forth." And then I got out of graduate school and Lord, (inaudible [00:15:37.071]) it behold, I ran smacking to America and I almost didn't recover, let's put it that way. 

00:15:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Hmm, wow Joe that's a fascinating story. Uhm, let me take you back to that space where, when you're talking about the, kind of, content domains. You talked about the preparation you'd had, the dynamic of being able to finish your course for, in a few years, did all your internships, done all the functional requirements. But you hinted at the process dynamics that went on, the interactions with you and your professors and what it was like for you as a young African American male in a program that is essentially all white. What are the lessons that you would share from that experience with today's graduate students? And about what they should be paying attention to as they navigate their way to graduate programs in America? 

00:16:35
DR. JOSEPH WHITE The lessons that I carried away from that was they expected inferiority out of me- (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Hmm. 

00:16:40
DR. JOSEPH WHITE - and then when somehow I was able to do as well or better than the other students that totally blew them away but the expectation was that I would be a marginal student. And so that was the sub-verbal that was communicated to me at the very beginning, then they backed up off of that. And then the other sub-verbal, ah, that I have almost forgotten but it comes back to me every now and then is the graduate students, especially the white male graduate students, had trouble with me because I excel then. 

00:17:30
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Hmm. 

00:17:30
DR. JOSEPH WHITE But it didn't come out right away because I graduated a year ahead of them, two years ahead of some of them and they threw me this party, the night I had my Ph.D. exam orals and it was a nice party but there was one boy outside of the party. He went out and it was spring afternoon or, or midsummer somewhere, and he was crying. And so I was, you know, following the dictates of Carl Rogers, I went out there to comfort him and I was trying to figure out why he was crying and everybody was having such a good time. And then he got mad and then he started cursing and excuse expression he said, "goddamn it Joe." He said, "You think everybody there admires you." I said, "Well yeah, why not? I mean, I've helped all these guys with their homework. I talked to troubled wives. They said I was the point man or the pacesetter." He said, "Well, we had a conversation," meaning, we, we these white males, "We had a conversation about you over in the psych lounge the other day and the tone of the conversation," he said, "that I participated," he said was, "That you couldn't be smarter than us 'coz you were a negro." And I said to myself, "Now I have walked through snow with these guys. I have mentored them." You know, I was the tutor, I had, always had some money, I lend them money. I said, "And why would they do something like that?" And that really, it just, it made me mad but I think I was more hurt. 

00:19:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Hmm. 

00:19:00
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  So there was, for me it was a more of a subtle kind of thing, especially after the first, ah, quarter, after the first 12 weeks 'coz once they saw I can perform, then they backed of off me. 

00:19:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM So not only the lesson and for the students who is not only, do you have to excel and try to achieve that level of excellence? Secondly they have pre-conceived notions and make a part of assumptions about who you are and what you're capable before you get there. And thirdly, even when you perform to a standard of excellence, it's hard for them to take that visual evidence, very concrete, and use it to wipe away these stereotypic images they have of who you are as a person based upon the color. 

00:19:45
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  Right, and at that time, I didn't realize that I was seeking their affirmation as a human being,- (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Hmm. 

00:19:55
DR. JOSEPH WHITE - that I wanted more than just a degree. But I didn't realize what was going on in my own mind, I wanted them to, to admire me, ah, ah, not adore me, but affirm me,- (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Uh hmm. 

00:20:10
DR. JOSEPH WHITE - as a human being. And they weren't ready to do that, they were ready to grant me a degree but not to affirm me as human being. And that's what I learned, well, it's set to ceded by mind, took me a few years that you don't seek psychological affirmation from your oppressor. Your oppressor can give you a job and a degree, but your affirmation, that's on you, but took me awhile to figure that out. 

00:20:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Uh hmm. One of the most profound lessons I remember learning from you as one of your students, in fact, was that- (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Um hmm. 

00:20:45
DR. THOMAS PARHAM - you know, you could never seek validation from your oppressor. There's a certain state within. Uhm, you talked about-(crosstalk) 

00:20:50
DR. JOSEPH WHITE There's one more piece on- (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Okay. 

00:20:55
DR. JOSEPH WHITE - mission state. And then I'll go to Malcolm, is that I'm smiling because I told a white man that I was lonely, that there were no other "Negroes" around, so then they let me admit some Negroes. So I brought Ed Mards(ph) there, Bob Green(ph), and a couple of others. So by the time I left, there were five of us. 

00:21:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Hmm. 

00:21:15
DR. JOSEPH WHITE But the problem was, that they kept comparing those other four young people to me, and that was not a good thing, you know? They kept saying, well, since Joe blasted his way to this program, why can't you all be like Joe? And they kept saying, "Well, we ain't Joe. We gotta be ourselves." You know? So- (crosstalk) 

00:21:30
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Hmm. (laughing) So, you open up a door, in some respects, only to set a standard that then is used against even some of the people who came to the door that you opened. 

00:21:40
DR. JOSEPH WHITE But we did get the door open. (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Uh-huh. 

00:21:45
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Then the man did come to me and he give me the paperwork and said, "Okay Joe, which one of these do you want?" 

00:21:50
DR. THOMAS PARHAM That's a good thing. You mentioned Malcolm X and the lessons that he would give you, and I think, Malcolm X 101 started with the idea of, what do they call a black man on America with a Ph.D.? 

00:22:05
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Dr. Niger(ph). 

00:22:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Right, just another Negro. And your professional career has coincided with that marvelous militancy of the '60s and '70s, uhm, that, that tension point between the Malcolm's and the Nationalist and the Kings and the Integrationist, ah, forces in America, as we struggle to figure out how do we, you know, achieve some kind of liberation. What influence did the civil rights and the Black Party Movements have on your development as a young psychologist? 

00:22:35
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  Well, I think I had to struggle through the opening kind of rhetoric, especially from Malcolm X, because when you first start talking to him, he start talking about the white man as the devil, and is evil, and he won't make your way in America, and yank up and all of them the mad scientist, so I couldn't work my way through all of that mythology, you know? And, so it took me a few years, but I got out in '61 by, but by '64, '65 time of the white's riot, I had begin to move toward a black consciousness, and because of my active participation in the civil rights movement, and going to jail in Mississippians stuff. So, I would try to think to myself, you know, I was in the immersion stage, if I could boil all of this down, all of this marching, rioting, picketing, demonstrating, into some psychological terms, what does it mean? 'Coz by that time I'm a psychologist. (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Hmm. 

00:23:40
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  So I remembered Martin Luther King, when somebody asked him, what does all of this mean? And he said somebody, and that triggered to me self-concept. You say somebody to a psychologist, you're talking self-concept, positive self-concept. And then, Stokely came behind him building on Malcolm, and for known, talking about self-determination, that was the key. When he said black power, he meant self-determination. We would decide who we are, and we will attempt to control our destiny. So, then, that begin to turn around in my head of identity,- (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
DR. JOSEPH WHITE - self-concept, control your own destiny, define who you are, and don't let others define you. So that, along with the resilience and the improvisation that my mom had taught me, they all begin to wind up together in the nucleus, ah, in embryonic stage of black psychology. 

00:24:45
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Fascinating, fascinating. So, we fast-forward now nine years to 1970. You often at that point what many considered would be a seminal article that was entitled to order black psychology. I wonder if you could share with our viewers, what was the empathies for writing that piece? And also share with us why you initially published that, and what is considered to be a non-traditional academic source? 

00:25:10
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  Well, there were two reasons why we begin to evolve the black psychology. By 1970, actually by 1968, there were few more of us. Ah, so, when we first went to APA in '68, I think there 11 of us that started this meeting, but we had two concerns. And they were same concerns, not only in psychology, but in America. One was, that we were invisible in psychology. Over half the graduate schools in psychology had never had a black student, and I think only one of them had a black professor, Ph.D. programs, one, ah, Kenneth Clark(ph). So, we were invisible. And in the textbooks, if you look at the textbooks of the '68, you look for Negro, black, African-American, mostly a big zero. And when we were present, we were present under some kind of inferiority model, there was something wrong with us. What this generation of psychologist calls the deficit deficiency model. There was something wrong with black people, they have a low IQ, couldn't do a complex task, over sexed, and this deficit deficiency view was sponsored by big time psychologist, we're talking Lewis Terman at Stanford, we're talking Yerkes, where the Yerkes Lab was named after, we're talking William ah, Robert Garrett, ah, president of APA, testified against the Supreme Court Student Segregation Case. So, we were kind of saying, no, this doesn't fit right,- (crosstalk) 

00:26:50
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Uh hmm. 

00:26:50
DR. JOSEPH WHITE - that we, we wanna challenge that, and we are not going to build a psychology of pathology. We were not gonna build, I'm not gonna build no psychology that says my momma was a sick woman. I'd just not gonna do that, it makes no sense to me, okay, because I saw her struggle and put and struggle of other black people. So, I'd knew they had strengths, so I'm gonna build a strength-based psychology. The second thing is, we're not gonna build a psychology from the IV Tower, and then take it down to the community. We're going to the community first, and have them tell us what do psychology is. Tell us when we go to funerals, we go to wedding, we go to boogaloo(ph), we go to card party, what are the psychological themes. So I wanted the people to own the psychology. So, now we come to where we're gonna publish the first stages of it. And so, since I want the people to own it, I want the people to know it exist, I put it in a black, ah, magazine, Ebony. And then I was told that Ebony sells a million copies and for every copy there are five readers in the barbershop, beauty shop, church, wherever. So you can hit five million people on one shot. And I wanted the people to own the psychology. Now let's fast-forward to 2004, '05, and '06. The past three APA presidents, the American Psych Association has said now they want America to own psychology. They wanted to be a household word. Now, when I first did that, then I was criticized right up here in this particular university, people said, well, this is not a referee journal, this is not the real psychology, and this is that. But now, 30 sub years later, here come the white man (inaudible [00:28:49.353]). We wanna make psychology so everybody can understand this and that. And now, we got popular magazines going to, ah, barns and nobles bookstore. You got a whole shelf of books on ten steps to have a better sex life, five steps to love yourself, two steps to this, this and that. And when I did it, I got criticized. 

00:29:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Just ahead of your time. 

00:29:10
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Ah, demeaning psychology. Cheapening psychology. 

00:29:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Just ahead of your time. (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Almost got in a fistfight about it. But, go ahead. 

00:29:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM (inaudible ). Uhm, staying with that theme, you talked about 1968, and the development of the Association of the Black Psychologist when they broke away from APA. And as you think about the development and, and operation-relation of the discipline of black psychology, I'm aware that the discipline itself has moved through several cycles over the past 37-40 years. I wonder if you can share with us your perspective on where that discipline has come from, and where you see it going in the future. 

00:29:55
DR. JOSEPH WHITE The first stage of the discipline was rebelling, that was the first stage. The second stage, which was attached to the first stage, of one, of we will define our own identity. So, identity was a very big piece of the first stage. And then, identity, along with the black consciousness and the moving through the transitions from Negro to black, all that was part of the first stage. Then the second stage was that we didn't originate in America. We came from somewhere else and we needed to reach back and put the foundation of our identity in Africa rather than in America 'coz we are not from here originally. We may be part of America now but we came from somewhere else of a proud people. So, then we put all that together. Now, we are expanding the psychology to books, journals, TV shows, and we're trying to work in community mental health, we're trying to get the content and courses in graduate school, undergraduate school. And then other people saw what we were doing, Asian dude said, "Well you're not going to find me anymore. I'm going to find myself." Indian dude said the same thing, Chinese dude ah, say the same thing, Mexican-American, so now you got this multicultural psychology but it started with ethnic foundation. And in this final stage or in stage where we're in now, your old American white psychology now has adopted some of our concepts and paradigms, only they don't give us credit. So spirituality is coming back into psychology, we brought that in. Gallows humor is coming back in there, we brought that in. Connectedness to others rather than independence is coming back in, we brought that in. I saw a big old book on resilience the other day, that's coming back in. And then the paradigm shift that we made from the linear model to the cyclical model is coming back into psychology because we said that you don't develop resilience at age four and improvisation at age five and connectedness at age nine. It's not a stage theory. You develop these things as you go through life in cycle. So you go deeper and deeper. So, improvisation was one thing to me when I was 12. It's another thing to me when I'm 74, deeper and deeper with the same slope(ph) resilience. (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Uh-huh. 

00:32:30
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  And then the whole psychology of optimal living in health, that came from us too. 'Coz we say, if you can internalize, discover, and rediscover the basic psychological themes of the African-American world view and internalize them, you can utilize those for healthy living. 

00:32:50
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Interesting. Within the Association of Black Psychologist, you've been both a founding member, certainly described by many as one of the contemporary followers of black psychology movement and those of us who know you well, kind of, nicknamed you the godfather, you know. Uhm, but as you think about the Association of Black Psychologists, AB Psych, in particular, at sometimes experience of parallel process between the struggle that the African-American community goes through in its own ranks, among the late(ph) community, in trying to balance those competing Nationalist versus Integrationalist forces as a way to achieve social progress, with what AB Psych does in trying to balance those two competing world views within the discipline of psychology, what role this is gonna play in being able to do that? What advice would you give, as one of the founding elders of the Association of the Black Psychologists and the discipline of black psychology to the next generation of leadership that is gonna be charged with carrying on the legacy that you have to create? 

00:34:00
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  To illustrate the point here, a lady called me from Philadelphia right before I came down here, she has a 15-year-old son who has a lot of talent but he's having trouble. He lost his tutor in chemistry and something else happened. She's a single mom. The boy is making A's and B's in Algebra and in Literature and what she wants is service. She wants me to help her get connected to a mentor, support system and so on. So, she didn't ask me anything about identity and world view, value systems, and so on. So what I have to try to do is get her connected with the services but I'm hoping that I can connect her with some services that, ah, build on the cultural strengths of black people. 

00:35:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Um hmm. 

00:35:05
DR. JOSEPH WHITE So, rather than come at her straight with ideology and values, I wanna hook her into a service network that also has a foundational support. And so I think that the challenge for the 21st century black psychologist is how to provide the services people need in hospitals, hospice, educational centers, whatever and at the same time have that in a foundation of cultural values. But if they come at people with the cultural values to someone who don't provide the service, that leaves the big empty space. 

00:35:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Pardon me 'coz it becomes theoretically relevant but practically irrelevant. 

00:35:45
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Right. 

00:35:45
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Okay. 

00:35:45
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Right, and it's important that they have the values and the, ah, philosophic, ah, anchorings of the African-American experience, but that's not where they open, that's not what they come to us for. 

00:36:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM So, it's really a question of sequencing. (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Sequencing, yes. (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Uh-huh. And grandma was clear that all books (inaudible [00:36:07.298]) no a common sense- (crosstalk) 

00:36:05
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Right. 

00:36:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Maybe it's a (inaudible [00:36:09.479]). 

00:36:05
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  Right. 

00:36:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Yeah. 

00:36:10
DR. JOSEPH WHITE But sometimes, in the university, with all our training as black psychologist, we get carried away with our theoretical models and don't rely we have to hook those to practical experience. 

00:36:20
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Uh-huh, uh-huh. Before we leave the kind of political aspects on the social activism parts of your career, ah, I wonder if you wouldn't mind discussing with ah, our viewers, there's a particular aspect of your career that I've always noticed from kind of a margins, where I remember the first time walking into your office at the university, 30 years ago, there are pictures on the wall with you and Angela Davis, Stokely Carmichael, and then there was one up there that I always found interesting, was you and Bobby Kennedy, and I remember how you used to talk about Bobby sometime in class. And, our listeners have heard that social movements and militancy, you had the social activism, even the critique of not just white folk, but rather the behavior of white folk would employ in engagement folk, yet with all of that, you found a way to still transcend demographic boundaries to have relationship with people who was significant, like the Bobby Kennedy, share some of that with us' if you will. 

00:37:30
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Well, when I got out of the graduate school, I thought that I would follow the careers of Piaget and Carl Rogers, I was trained as child psychologists and I wanted also to be an educator and a practitioner. But it wasn't long before people came to me and they wanted me to deliver things programmatically for them, people in the community. They see a black person with a Ph.D. And there was a time when I was the only Ph.D. black licensed psychologist in California, so people would come to me (inaudible [00:38:05.276]) everyday and they wanted me to deliver. They didn't care enough about Piaget and Carl Rogers. So, ah, what struck me and I think that sticks with me to this very day was, I was leaving down on Stanton(ph), California, in the hood, in Long Beach, Stanton, a Martin Luther King Boulevard now, and a boy got hit by a car on the street that should had a stop sign. So, the people in the community came to me 'coz I had a Ph.D. I was a college professor and they wanted me to get a stop sign for them. So I go down on the City Council and I had a long ah, essay prepared and so forth because I was functioning off what I've been taught about government and civics in school. I figured the city council made decisions and that's where I would go. So I talked, I had half an hour, and after I finished talking I went back home and Willy Brown heard about it and called me. He was up in San Francisco and he was just starting his career in legislature. He said, "Joe, the City Council don't make decisions. That's not who the decision makers are." He said, "Now I'm gonna give you the name of a rich white lady that lives in Belmont Shore and the name of the president of Standard Oil. I said, "Well, they're not elected officials." He said, "No, but they are the decision makers, okay?" So I went to the ladies house, and she had a black lady that was her maid, serving tea and coffee and cakes and stuff. And she said, "You seem like a nice Negro man. Don't go back to the City Council. I'll take care of your stoplight." So I got a stoplight just like that. So then I begin to say, there are people around here who make decisions and I got to figure out how this thing works, because all, I got all these people coming to me, wanting things. My son needs a job. My son needs to get out of Soledad and go on parole. I got another child who wants to get in the college. My son needs a higher score to get in the army, and this and that. So, I gotta figure out how this thing works. So then, Willy hooked me up with the Kennedy's and one thing I admired about the Kennedy's was, they do how it worked. (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Hmm. 

00:40:05
DR. JOSEPH WHITE That caused it. They were(ph) masters of the game of decision making and power. And then why I admired Bobby Kennedy was just as I was kinda getting started with them, I was a gopher. You know, I drive them around and so forth. When his brother was assassinated, he, the bottom dropped out of his life. I mean, one day he was next to the most powerful man in the world and the next day it was all gone. Bang! (ph) Just like that. So to recover, he tried to read Greek tragedy. They didn't believe in psychoanalysis and therapy. He tried to read Greek tragedy and that didn't work. So then we took him down to some black churches in Mississippi and he saw people with no money, no power, not enough food, who could bang on a tambourine at a Wednesday night meeting and sing gospel song. So he got the pat in his foot in doing that gospel and the boy developed some soul. And then I really admired him. I mean, I first I admired him 'coz he had all that power but then when he developed that soul, and I believe we helped him heal. 

00:41:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Particularly, with people who themselves had experienced degradation and even loss of life of their own family members and how they came to heal and what you call the broken places. (crosstalk) 

00:41:25
DR. JOSEPH WHITE That's right, that's right. They came to heal in the broken places and he began to say, well, Greek tragedy is one thing but these brothers and sisters down here, picking his cot from shelf, bail him in jail and everything, they got something going on. And so he developed a soul kind of thing. 

00:41:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Yeah, yeah. That's, that's fascinating and thank you for sharing that. Let me shift now from the social activists who the, the scholar and researcher. And in your professional career, you've authored or co-authored numerous articles and book chapters, as well as six books, The Psychology of Blacks, uh, one to third edition. Uhm, certainly, The Troubled Adolescents, uhm, the latest book with Dr. Connor, Black Fathers, but one of the ones I wanna focus on in this interview is Black Men Emerged: Facing the Past, Seizing the Future in America. And it describes the conditions and challenges that are faced by African American males in particular in this country but I think they are lessons for lots of people. What message were you seeking to tell in that book? 

00:42:30
DR. JOSEPH WHITE There were three messages I was seeking to tell in that book. The first message was if you want to understand the people, you have to go beyond stereotypes and if you look at the stereotypes of black culture, I mean, of popular culture in America, Black man is a thug, a hoodlum, superstar rapper, superstar, uh, basketball player, uh, that kind of thing. And their images are either unattainable or they're, uh, negative stereotypes. So I wanna get behind the image. The second thing I wanted to do was once I got behind the image, was try to articulate the challenges black men face, black males, from the cradle to the grave. What are the psychological challenges they face in terms of identity, intimacy, coping with racism. And the third thing I wanted to do was to articulate the strengths black men need from the cradle to the grave, to articulate the strengths black men need from the cradle to the grave to successfully master the challenges. So go behind the stereotype, articulate the psychological challenges and discuss the strengths they need. So that was the three-fold motif for that book. 

00:44:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Hmm. And as you fast-forward now, the book has been out for a long time. Has your thinking changed at all? Or has it been reinforced by what you see in terms of the challenges that black males have to face in today's society? 

00:44:15
DR. JOSEPH WHITE The, the thinking is the same, the next piece is what is the psychological or the -- rather, what is the psycho educational model to assist black men in discovering, rediscovering, internalizing, activating, and utilizing these strengths. So if you have a group session with 15-year-old black boys, how do you help them recognize what these strengths are and how to utilize them? So I've had to add a psycho educational piece, uh, from where we started. And other people have jumped in and added pieces to it. 

00:45:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Sure, uhm, I've always been struck by this observation, there're lots of folks in the academy who publish, you know, tens and, and, and forty and fifty and sixty publications that are kinda shot gun and -- but don't really identify a clear theme even in terms of the work that they do. The focus in your career has certainly been much more on, I think, quality and message. Of all the things you've published, the books, the articles, the book chapters, what's your favorite? 

00:45:35
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  The favorite is the 1970 Ebony piece because that was the breakthrough toward a black psychology. Ebony magazine, ah, hit the, uh, the, the right buttons it got to the black community and it got over and people begin -- the buzz was created, in the barbershop, the university, and high schools, churches, you know. That here he is -- there's something called this black psychology and it's a good thing. 

00:46:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Hmm and I see there's a smile on your face. You get a particular level of satisfaction for that one. 

00:46:10
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Yeah. 

00:46:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Yeah. 

00:46:10
DR. JOSEPH WHITE And, and it's still is, and it's still being read over and over again in not just black psychology classes but in general psychology, introduction to psychology. And I'm smiling because I'm going to San Francisco, Monday, to lecture in a class of 700 undergraduates in general psychology, and that's on their reading(ph) list. 

00:46:30
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Still. 

00:46:35
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Yeah and then they jacked up the teacher, said, "We want just to do it here," you know, the teacher's a white lady, she's a good white lady but they said they want the real deal. 

00:46:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM (Laughing) So we don't want you to quote him in the book with a real name.(ph) 

00:46:45
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Right. Yeah. 

00:46:45
DR. THOMAS PARHAM That's a good thing. Let's continue to shift focus, uh, uh, as our time is moving on. Let's move from the researcher-scholar part to the mentoring part and, and throughout your career. You've been described as, as the consummate mentor. What is it about that role that gives you so much satisfaction and what is it that you see in people that activates that mentoring instinct in you? 

00:47:15
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Well, I guess I have always believed, being an all child psychologist, that young people have potential. That, that is just a belief of mine. I don't care what their test scores are, what their high school grades are, that these young people have potential. And I've also believed, based on my own life, that if an adult, especially a high status adult, spend some time with them and believes in them, demonstrated by behavior not just running up, say, "I believe in you, I believe in you", but by their behavior, they will come to believe in themselves. If a high status adult spends time with a young person, believes in them, they will come to believe in themselves. And once they begin to believe in themselves and adopt the "can do" spirit, they will start to blossom. And I love to see that blossom. They're just -- that's just been the greatest piece of my life. And as always, I guess, been in there because from the time I started preschool, I was always sort of the point man. You know, people needed their homework done or needed an extra glass of milk or something, I can always figure out how to do that, you know. So I -- it, it was just something that was in me, and it just -- and it worked, and I loved it. 

00:48:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM So that helped in spirit. 

00:48:40
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Yeah. And then there comes a point in time because I live solo(ph), where they teach me, you know, 'coz some of my students now, are my first students, are in their 60's. 

00:48:50
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Well. 

00:48:55
DR. JOSEPH WHITE So we have the role reversal where they become the teacher and they go out and do different things and then they come down and break it down to me. 

00:49:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  So that certainly talks about the, uhm, the fascination and certainly what activates that, that mentoring spirit. 

00:49:10
DR. JOSEPH WHITE And then they teach others. 

00:49:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Right. 

00:49:10
DR. JOSEPH WHITE So the 62-year-olds and the 50, they got little (inaudible [00:49:16.812]) running up and down the street. I mean, I was at Southern Illinois, the university, the other day and I met this young woman, came up to me, Angelie(ph) or something like that, Anne Julie (ph), Indian young woman. She was a student of yours. 

00:49:30
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Yeah? 

00:49:30
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Yeah and, and just out of the blue. I said, "Damn," you know, they just got two or three generations here and now. 

00:49:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM That's the way it works, that's friendship turn. 

00:49:40
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Right and I've been going from university for 13 years and here she is. 

00:49:45
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Um-hmm. Staying with that mentoring function, for those of us who had, uh, an opportunity, and were blessed to be mentored and taught by you. I remember us always saying, "Joe, how can we thank you?" And your response has been -- is typical across the generations as it was to us, you know, 30 years ago, which is, "I appreciate it but I don't need your thanks. What I expect is that, what I do for you is you do for other people." How do you see that playing out now in, in the row(ph)? 

00:50:20
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  Well, not only has the mentoring process been fascinating for me to do but one of the unexpected surprises and gratifications is to see the people that I have worked with begin to mentor others without me making them do that. You know, I just say that that's important so that if you look at the 50 years that I've been in psychology, you can see almost every ten-year period, five cohorts, and they're all mentoring people. So that there's this spread of fact. My only concern is, outside of our network, the whole mentoring thing has taken off but I'm not sure the people writing all these books understand the human connection. What makes it works for, for us is the human connection, you know, the cognitive part, those kids are smart enough to get but it's the human connection that builds the self-confidence. 

00:51:20
DR. THOMAS PARHAM And you continue to do that. I mean, as I observe you at different conferences, be it a APA or AB Psych(ph) or other places where we've been, there's always a place. It could be the lobby of a hotel, it could be the restaurant but this is kind of sense of holding court and the audience at that point didn't become young students. It is even -- or the current professionals. We're always seeking that guidance, seeking that support, but you're right and looking less for just information and more by how to just connect with the master about, you know, how do you, you know, get some support, get an idea, get some encouragement, get some affirmation, get somebody who just, you know, provide us sense of caring, that they, you know, desperately seek. 

00:52:00
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Yeah and that, that, that, that, that connection, that sense of caring is very important not only for the graduate students but for the young professionals trying to find their way. 

00:52:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Uh huh. 

00:52:10
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  And also, going back to the politics of, uh, Kennedy and others, I discovered hanging with them, that there was an inside game but when you're growing up Black and poor or low, middle income, you're not taught the inside game, how it works. And that's what I want young people to understand. This is how it works. This is how you get a paper published. This is how you get a job. This is how you move the universal power within the university. This is how it works because if the kids don't have anybody to guide them, then they just stumble around. Take five years to figure something up. That I can figure out in five minutes 'coz I've done it. 

00:53:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Right, right. So given that, there'll be many students and professionals and others who will view this tape in which they had an opportunity to be mentored by you. I know I hear that in lots of places that I go around the country. For those who are viewing this tape, what two or three lessons would you like to share with them that might help them confront the challenges that they face in life more confidently? 

00:53:25
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  Well, I would say what my grandmother told my sister and my female cousins. You gotta kiss a few frogs in this world before you find a prince. So that if you're looking for a mentor, and that's a popular thing now, a beautiful mentor is not gonna fall out of the sky into your arms. You'll gonna have to go knock on a few doors and you'll gonna have to get a bit from here and a bit from there and don't get all disappointed and been out of shape if the first two people you approached don't have time for you, just any other but if you pick up a bit here and a bit there, a bit at this conference, a bit of this other one, and gradually it will fall in place. It would be beautiful if we could give everybody a mentor upfront that would connect with them, be a role model, be an inspiration, but that's not gonna happen. 

00:54:20
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Yeah. Yeah. 

00:54:20
DR. JOSEPH WHITE But I tell them keep approaching people. You'd be surprised that there are responsive people out there but you gotta go after them, they're not gonna come to you. 

00:54:30
DR. THOMAS PARHAM So, so an important lesson indeed for all the folks that are watching this tape. Throughout your life and career, you've been blessed to receive many accolades and awards from different professional associations and groups. Among that universe of recognition, which award or awards stand out the most for you and why? 

00:54:55
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  There are two awards that stand out for me, maybe three. The one that stands out the most is the most recent. On May the 10th, I'm going to get an honorary Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota. And why that is important is because I grew up five blocks away from that school, right across the river. I could have walked to school and I have a good part time job and I could have lived in a community center and work as a coach with the younger children, wouldn't cost many money. And they had community college which we all call the junior college built right in the university college, general college. For children like me who weren't get focused, but nobody encouraged me to become a student there because black boys of my generation were raises to be shoe shine boys, shovel coal, that kind of thing. So 57 years after I graduate from high school, now here they come with this Ph.D. Now white folks love complications. You can't get them nothing simple. If you asked them how much two and two is or in a math department, the man will give an hours worth of answer but he can't say four. I don't know what it is about that. Now 57 years ago, when I graduated in high school, 17-year-old, awesome, little, bitty(ph) associate dean would have to do and sign admission slip. Now, they didn't go to this whole process, they got a dozen (inaudible [00:56:33.231]) this thick. They'd gonna check me out from time I was born, I even have a letter from Nancy Bolosi(ph) to give me this degree when 57 years ago they just could admitted me. So that -- but it come full circle now, I've come full circle from being a sun burnt Swede(ph) to get in this degree. 

00:56:50
DR. THOMAS PARHAM What goes around comes around. 

00:56:50
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  Comes around, and then we're going to do the black thing on Thursday, the 10th, we're going to the University, then were going right across to river to my neigborhood. What's left of it 'coz the freeway can't be there and we're gonna have a get down boogaloo(ph), corn bread, fried chicken, gospel music, short speeches. 

00:57:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Participate in every phase of the process. 

00:57:15
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Right, and my youngest daughter who is a professor of geology at San Francisco State is gonna speak for the family and one of your students is gonna speak for my career, Dr. Nemo Patel(ph). So tell me about it. So that was the greatest, and the second greatest was, Michigan State University, uh, gave me an award of the Alumni of the Year in the school of Social Science, three years ago, and the Psych Department honored me and so forth. So they called me, you know, I'm their boy, and that made me think of something else which I have forgotten. Me, and the Psychology Department have a big fallen out after I left graduate school, once I jump in to the black thing. 

00:58:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM (inaudible [00:58:13.038]) Michigan State University. 

00:58:10
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Yes, Michigan State, we had a big all fallen out, because they said that they trained me to be a leader in Psychology ala Piaget, Carl Rogers, and now I'm jumping off on this black thing. So they felt I was the one who brought the racism in the psychology and they were very disappointed with me because when I left there I was the one of the nicest Negroes you ever wanted to meet. I was a black Anglo Saxon. I had a black face but I had a white identity and then I flipped out when I came to California according to their version of events. Okay, we almost had a knock down, drag out, knock down, drag out in APA back in the mid '60s. But anyhow in 1996, they had the 58th anniversary of the Ph.D. program and they call very back from the time it started in 1946- 1996 and they had a big all reception and everything. You know, pictures of every class, graduate student and, uh, they gave one award in each area clinical, social, experimental, developmental. And blew me away that they gave the award in clinical, that I was the best student that came to clinical at that 50 years. They gave me the award. And then what really blew me away was they got up on the stage, two of my professors were still living then and they said they put the idea of black psychology up in my head. 

00:59:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM (Laughing) 

00:59:40
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  And my wife was very quiet, almost jumped up and, and got up in their face. I said, "No, baby if that's what they think let it, let it alone." Let bygones be bygone. So we got made up now, we got (inaudible [00:59:58.747]) common ground. 

00:59:55
DR. THOMAS PARHAM You can always afford to be humble in victory. 

01:00:00
DR. JOSEPH WHITE That's right. But I forgot about that.? 

01:00:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM As you think about those awards and, and their significance, it's incredible to see that we've almost come full circle. Because as you graduate from school talking about, uhm, uh, liking, appreciating their affirmation of validation, move into a space where you where clear that in a more self-determined way, that you can't seek validation from the oppressor. But now 40-50 years later, winding back around to now say yes you end up getting that affirmation and validation from folk in that kind (inaudible [01:00:41.375]) respect kind of way. But people have to give it up, not based on the fact that you were just black but base on the fact that you were excellent. 

01:00:45
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Yeah and based on the fact that I then define what was excellent in my own terms rather than their terms. See, when I left graduate school I tried to seek affirmation on their terms and didn't work. So now I've come back around, 47 years after leaving graduate school, and have been part of this whole set of movements in psychology and now I'm getting affirmed for that, which makes me feel pretty good. 

01:01:20
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Hmm. 

01:01:20
DR. JOSEPH WHITE So you have to out live your oppressor too. That's another lesson I've learned, not only to seek affirmation, well see, that poor brothers, you know, that we lost all these brothers along the way so they never got to see the end game. And they struggled and then they strokes, heart attacks to come out whatever. 

01:01:35
DR. THOMAS PARHAM I'm aware also that you've received awards distinguished psychologist from the Association of Black Psychologists, mentoring awards at Teachers College Columbia University for Janet Helms, what was the importance of those awards in the space of, of, of your career? 

01:01:55
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Well I think the awards from the African-American Psych Association, AB Psych, the importance of that was recognition from my people, from black folk, that just brother is down, we don't agree with then a hundred percent. But this brother's okay, he paid his dues and he stood up for us. The Janet Helms Award was the same thing, that this brother was a pioneer and he opened up the door for the rest of us and we appreciate that, you know, we may not agree with everything he says and they're doing their thing and (inaudible [01:02:31.725]) but this brother broke the barrier and now we all can come on through the gate. 

01:02:35
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Yeah. 

01:02:35
DR. JOSEPH WHITE And then I got that Outstanding Teaching Award here and I'm smiling because I was supposed to get it 25 years ago when you guy weren't still here. Somebody took up a whole thing up stairs but they said no, no Bob Gomez had a whole, big whole (inaudible [01:02:53.174]) thing, you know, and so I forgot about it. And then here they come around here two or three years ago but that's you got to out live your oppressor until they come back around. 

01:03:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Until he comes back around, that very true. What's also interesting is that in your career, you know, as we, we finish up with the award in accolade. You've always been admired from students across discipline. So it hasn't been psychology specific, you have students in medicine, law, dentistry, business, whatever and also across demographic boundary. And so students, whether they were white, African-American, Latino, Asian, Indian, uhm, international folk, everybody seems to gravitate towards you. What is it about your style in your work with them that allows them to make that kind of connection, that in the course of American society and everyday living, we can't seem to move passed those demographic boundaries? 

01:03:50
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Well three things, Thomas, number one is, for whatever reason I am the same human being I was when I was 45 years old, and that is I wanna make the connection as Joe to this other human being, be they Tom, be they (inaudible [01:04:18.631]), be they Billy(ph). I wanna make the human connection and I realized I'm 74 years old, I'm professor, Ph.D. But I wanna make the human connection and I think that human connection is empowering. The second thing is, well I don't like what a class of people did to us as black people in America, these 17-year-old, 18-year-old, 19-year-old white kids are still human beings, so I make the human connection with them and then the underlying theme is, "Look, if you wanna hang with us, you got to act right." I mean, you can't come up in here, you know, with that crazy stuff you'll all been doing, you do not come around me with that. But other than, if you come on in the door, the door is opened, you know, I work with you, human being to human being but you have to respect the other people in the network, whether you're black, female, gay, whoever you are, you have to respect the other people in the network or else you have to get away from around here. You know, but, but the door is open and I'll work with you. 

01:05:25
DR. THOMAS PARHAM What's amazing about that is that there is some need people in life who psychological experience reminds me of an old African proverb that comes out, I believe, the Cameroon that says wood already torched by fire is not hard to re-ignite. You know, it talks about the, the flames of oppression, discrimination, and this tragedy that so singe people's experience, that they never recover and what you call heal in the broken places. 

01:05:55
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Um-hmm. 

01:05:55
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Yet despite all of what you've through in life, looking at, you know, your mother's experience growing up, graduate school life out on the street, social activism, you've never been hurt in those places that allowed you be permanently singed, you know and, and forget that human capacity to be able to connect with people in authentic ways across all the demographic boundaries that you transcend. 

01:06:20
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Yeah, and I also come from a family that demonstrated some of that to me as a child. So I grew up in the great depression of the 1930's. Now obviously my family didn't have any money. But people, they use to called bums or (inaudible ), I don't know what name you call it now. What come knocking on the back door want something to eat, and my mother, grandmother too, would never turned nobody away, never. I saw that and I knew they didn't have very much but they could always feed one more person in palpable. But in some way that made him feel good. That was, that was empowering for them and they figured, the next day they get some more food from somewhere, I don't know where they would gonna get it but they got it. 

01:07:35
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Again, making a way out of nowhere. 

01:07:40
DR. JOSEPH WHITE That right, so that spirit came to me from childhood now. I'm almost lost it a couple of time in that bitterness and anger, '60s, death, and this and that but then I remember that there was something deeper in me than psychotherapy and academic psychology, it was the spirit of the people. And I had to recapture that spirit in order to keep the flame moving. It took me a little while. 

01:08:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Yeah, yeah. We've got just a few more questions and I, and I thank you for really being generous with your time here. The versatility of your career has included roles as academician, scholar, administrator, mentor, we've talked about, and also clinician. So let's, for a minute, focus on the clinical side, in, in that role. The profession of psychology and counseling are struggling with notions of cultural competence and have a best treat client population were culturally different. As you look at the issues of cultural competence, what would you say are the most salient aspects of the therapeutic encounter? And what becomes most facilitative in healing, in that moment of encounter between therapist and patient? 

01:09:00
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  Well I think the therapist has to cross two layers of their own development. One is the layer of pathology, there is belief system on the part of people who train psychologist, some of them, that people come to you because there is something wrong with them. And even our patients, our clients have figured that out 'cause they come in here and tell us what's wrong (inaudible). I'm depress, my boyfriend ran out and left me, whatever, whatever. So the therapist has to cross the barrier from the presentation of pathology and a belief in it to a connection with the potential strengths of the client. I don't care whether they are in drug rehab or the LAR(ph). That's one big old barrier because part of us has been led to believe that the patient is sick and that's why they came in there. And the other barrier which is even bigger is, we grew up in a society where people of color were thought to have something wrong with that. So you got the one barrier of the pathology in general then you got the second barrier where these people have something wrong with them because they are inferior, because they're Native American Black whatever. Uh, so you got to cross that barrier. And when you're dealing with a person of color, you have to know what strengths they potentially have. So if all you have heard about these people as there's something wrong with them, how are you gonna find their strengths? Like I remember when I first started recruiting Chicano students up in the San Joaquin Valley. The first people I had were young women, 3.6, 3.7 average but when I went to the Farm Labor Camp, they have to get them out of the fields and I saw these young women, 18 years old, out in that field picking crops, 95 degrees, now I know those kids have strengths. You could not do that unless you have strengths. So the therapist has to see the strengths in the person's culture and help them activate that. So, they have to pass through two layers. One is the general pathology model and the other is the inferiority models that America presents toward people of color. And once a therapist can pass through them and make the human connection, then we're good to go. 

01:11:45
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Yeah, it, it's synonymous I think even with what we've talked about today in competency(ph) models that start with one of those knowledge and skill. (crosstalk) 

01:11:55
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Um-hmm. 

01:11:55
DR. THOMAS PARHAM - but awareness being that first phase where you have to really get in touch with the biases and assumptions that you bring with you into that therapeutic space. Some of which is clouded by your own socialization if you will. (crosstalk) 

01:12:05
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  Um-hmm. 

01:12:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM - for being in America. The other which is clouded by the training that you receive that is to pathology-oriented and not strength-based. 

01:12:15
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Right. It's like you gotta keep a dual focusing mind. 

01:12:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Right. 

01:12:15
DR. JOSEPH WHITE You know, the person is coming in, present a set of things and you have to acknowledge that, that's a valid part of the person's experience. But at the same time, you gotta keep in mind that a person's gotta get in touch with their strengths if they're gonna live a productive life. 

01:12:30
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Yeah, yeah, it sounds to me an important lesson for our viewers is to, uh, to listen to. 

01:12:35
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Yeah, and, uh, I was working with some drug counselors and with the patients the other day at San Francisco. I had two days and I asked them what are the strengths of black people and both groups got it. Boom, boom, boom, boom, then I cleaned it up. And then I said, "Well let's talk about how you internalize this in your daily life." Patients picked right up on it, taking notes and stuff. 

01:13:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Some (inaudible [01:13:03.815]) is relevant to the people. 

01:13:00
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  Um-hmm. 

01:13:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Yeah. As I went around the country as well in my speaking and training, I oftentimes invite people to understand the difference between what they do for a living and who they are as people at the core(ph) of their being(ph). We know a lot about what you do and have done in your career. 

01:13:25
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Um-hmm. 

01:13:25
DR. THOMAS PARHAM We've talked about the different roles in this interview. But I wonder if you can share with us who Joe White really is at the core of your being. 

01:13:35
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  At the core of my being, the healthy side of me is fascinated with life and the healthy side of me, this came later as I got up into young adulthood and mid-adulthood, is fascinated with the process of social change to undo the heavy burdens, as Isaiah said and let the oppressed go free. It fascinates me and, of course, I thought somebody could lead me to the Promised Land but then I finally figured out that Martin Luther King and all of them were gone, that I would have to lead myself and others that were looking to me. 

01:14:30
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Yeah. 

01:14:35
DR. JOSEPH WHITE You know, that, that was, uh, another stumbling block but, uh, just -- life itself is beautiful. It fascinates me, with all its pain. 

01:14:45
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Yeah, that's, that's deep. There's a, there's a gospel artist who years ago, in fact, I think he's saying this to me for Jesse Jackson's presidential run back on '80s, his name is Wintley Phipps, who sang a song called "God Uses Ordinary People. 

01:15:00
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Um-hmm. 

01:15:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM To Do As He Commands." 

01:15:05
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Um-hmm. 

01:15:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM I get that vision when I hear you talk about- (crosstalk) 

01:15:05
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Yeah. 

01:15:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM - that. 

01:15:05
DR. JOSEPH WHITE And there's a lady at the, uh, University of Minnesota that studies resilience, she's gonna do a slideshow on me. Those pictures from the time I'm four-years-old. She talks about ordinary magic, you know, that it's ordinary people who kind of get it together, you know, that figure out the resilience piece, the improvisation, they're not necessarily as brilliant as Einstein but it's their ordinary magic. 

01:15:35
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Ordinary magic. 

01:15:35
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Ordinary magic, just you have the ordinary everyday you know, brothers and as I look back on my childhood, one of the things that troubles me but also fascinates me is, I was not the brightest child in the cohort, I mean, they're -- brothers could shoot dice better than me, play pool, talk to girls, you know, but somehow the pieces for them didn't come together and somehow for me, it did. You know, I have the ups and downs but, uh, I've just had a fascinating life. You know, I hate (inaudible [01:16:12.970]) and people I'm still bad at, I don't have any big beef(ph) about life. 

01:16:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Um-hmm. 

01:16:15
DR. JOSEPH WHITE It's been good to me. 

01:16:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  And that, that brings us into, uhm, one of our final questions. It was the great Algerians that (inaudible [01:16:29.308]) friends from none, who said that each generation has an opportunity to fulfill it's legacy or betray it. As you look back over your life and career, what do you believe has been the most important contribution in creating your legacy? 

01:16:50
[sil.] 

01:16:50
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  There's an old miner song in, at the West Virginia, sang at funerals, real sad song, white folks sing it, called "What Shall I Leave Behind," and there's moaning, groaning. 

01:17:10
[sil.] 

01:17:10
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  And what I wanna leave behind. 

01:17:20
[sil.] 

01:17:20
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  Is that I experienced it all, love, tragedy, success, whatever, death, all that stuff, assassination. 

01:17:40
[sil.] 

01:17:40
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  That I tried to give it my best shot and that was the best I was capable of and it was a good ride. 

01:17:55
DR. THOMAS PARHAM It certainly was a good ride. 

01:17:55
DR. JOSEPH WHITE It was a good ride. 

01:18:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM We used to always joke and thank for viewers watching that when we would get into our quiet spaces and kinda sit down(ph) (inaudible ) trip(ph), we'd always say we're doing too bad for a couple of (inaudible [01:18:15.581]), you know. 

01:18:10
DR. JOSEPH WHITE You ain't doing too bad. 

01:18:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM You ain't doin too bad. 

01:18:10
DR. JOSEPH WHITE I ain't doing too bad, for a poor boy(ph) I've done all right, you know and, uh, and even from the loss and the setbacks, I learned and I think that most dangerous thing about being a black man in America, may be a black woman, but I'm a black man, is being consumed by anger and bitterness, that will destroy you. It's justifiable. I mean it's understandable why our brothers get consumed with all that. I understand them but it's almost like, you gotta deal with the contradiction and find a way to keep on, keep it on which is hard 'coz it's, it's unfairness, unjust, it's existential. 

01:19:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Yeah, the, the brilliant, uh, academician and scholar Cornwell(ph) West(ph) talks about the, the duality, the spirituality, and he says that "as long as you have spirituality, you'll always have instances of unjustified suffering, unmerited pain, undeserved (inaudible [01:19:22.898])." The question is- (crosstalk) 

01:19:20
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Um-hmm. 

01:19:20
DR. THOMAS PARHAM - not does craziness happen but how do you sustain some movement and momentum in the face of that adversity so that you'll never allow misery to have the last word. 

01:19:30
DR. JOSEPH WHITE And he got that from Martin Luther King who said, "Honor and suffering is redemptive." Continue to work with the belief that unearned suffering is redemptive. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Uh, only he didn't teach us because he was in a psycho-educational psychologist to go from unearned suffering to redemption. I mean, how do you get from one polarity to the other and then in direction of the earth, for known(ph) had his eye right on the center of what oppression does to a person's identity, but he died before he could pull us out on the other end. But as far as the diagnosis of what happens to an oppressed people and what the oppressor does and then how he plays the mind game, the boy was brilliant but then he passed before his time as many of that generation did with -- could have kept him another fifteen, twenty years. And I've had the good fortune to outlive all my mentors. I mean, they died, Martin Luther King, (inaudible ) thirty, Bobby Kennedy was 43, Malcolm was 39. So I, I've had the chance to see the other side of 50 which they never had. 

01:20:55
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Yeah. 

01:21:00
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Okay? 

01:21:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM That's powerful. Is there anything that we've not covered in this interview that you'd like to share with our viewers before we conclude? 

01:21:10
DR. JOSEPH WHITE I think what I would like to share with the viewers was, I grew up in a home without a father as many black males of this generation, current generation do but what I found was there are father figures available in the community. They may not be biological fathers or legal fathers, stepfather but there are older men, I don't care whether uncle, preacher, whoever, who will help you make the connections that you need to land on your feet as a solid male. And it took me a long time to get over the resentment that I have toward my biological father but it dawned on me one day that the healing was on me not him because he passed on. So, I had to do the healing. So, that was a missing piece but I was fortunate to find male figures at key points in my life who could step into the next. 

01:22:25
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Dr. White, we wanna thank you for the opportunity and privilege of being able to sit with you today and just talk about your career in life, uhm, I'm reminded, as we conclude, the Honorable Marcus Garvey, you know, passionate, revolution and (inaudible [01:22:48.525]) his own right was found (inaudible ) that chance has never satisfy the hope of a suffering people. It's only through hard work, persistence and suffering (inaudible [01:22:59.706]) by which the oppressed have never realized that a lot of them are free. You know, as I hear you talk about your life and the legacy that you have left, you really have contributed to both your own personal liberation and other peoples. Partly because you are a model of that suffered lines(ph) persistence that Garvey talked about in his saying. 

01:23:25
DR. JOSEPH WHITE And I've had the chance to live out part of Garvey's (inaudible [01:23:33.115]) you know, I've had the opportunity, you know, but I'm still the same basic boogaloo(ph) brother that I was when I was a teenager, I mean, that, that ain't change. 

01:23:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM (Laughing) 

01:23:40
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  What, whatever, they dressed me up and gave me a title, little Jews(ph), you know. 

01:23:50
DR. THOMAS PARHAM And you still got a little bit long way to go, (inaudible [01:23:53.392]) got promises to keep? 

01:23:50
DR. JOSEPH WHITE  Miles to go. 

01:23:55
DR. THOMAS PARHAM And miles to go before we sleep. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Dr. Thomas Parham. It's been my pleasure to be with Dr. Joseph White. We thank you for joining us this day and hope that something that we've said will inspire you to think about operationalize(ph) some of the principles and practices we've heard Dr. White talked about. Good day.
