Reducing Mental Health Disparities: Preliminary Findings from a Brief, Anti-Stigma Intervention for Chinese Immigrant Relatives of Individuals with Psychosis Lawrence H. Yang, Ph.D. Columbia University 

00:00:00
UNKNOWN Good afternoon, and welcome to our paper session this afternoon. My name is Michael Lau, I'm an assistant in the counseling psychology program, here at teachers college, and it's my pleasure to get to introduce a friend and a colleague, Dr. Lawrence Yang, today. Lawrence Yang is an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University. He received his PhD in clinical psychology from Boston University, and attended Harvard medical school for clinical internship. Dr. Yang studies the social prothesis[SP] that shaped the course schizophrenia with diverse culture and specifically Chinese immigrant groups. He has 30 peer reviewed papers, plus seven book chapters, including publications in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, and The Lancet. Dr. Yang is an affiliate researcher at the NIH funded National Asian American Center on health disparities at UC Davis, and is the sole intervention researcher that studies psychotic disorders among Asian American nationally. Dr. Yang has received six early career awards, four of which are national for his work. He has received a five year K-award from NIMH, and is scheduled to receive a five year RO1 grant from NIMH to study the stigma of the newly developed Hybris for psychosis diagnosis. Dr. Yang is also very active in mentoring a new generation of researchers in Asian American mental health, with about 12 to 15 grad students under his mentorship at any given time. Please join me in welcoming Dr. Yang.

ANTI-STIGMA INTERVENTION FOR CHINESE IMMIGRANT RELATIVES OF INDIVIUALS WITH PSYCHOSIS: LAWRENCE YANG, PH.D. GRACE LAI, MSW ASSISTANT PROFESSOR COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY Reducing Health Disparities 

00:02:30
LAWRENCE YANG Thank you Dr. Lau for that gracious invitation. I'm so happy to see some familiar faces in the audience today. First of all I want to say what an honor it is to present at the round table, I had been an attendee at this conference for years, and it has a special place in my heart. What I've always loved about the round table, was it's commitment to social justice, and in addition to listening- coming and listening to the research, what I always took from it was hearing about the researchers, and clinicians, their stories. Why they do the work that they do, how they came to where they are today. And so, in that spirit, I'm going to share some of my story with you as well, as I go through my presentation. So in graduate school, I began again studies in clinical psychology, and I became really fixated with this question of stigma among Asian American groups, because we recognized as a pervasive and pernicious social force, and one that I think actually underlies a great deal of mental health under utilization, and mental health disparities that we among Asian American groups. So, I always wondered, well, why doesn't somebody study that? And so what- I resolved to do that as a graduate student. And something, and that's something- a path that I have not really clung to through many twists and turns. So, you know, I see a lot of beginning researchers and clinicians in the audience, and so one thing I think that I share with you is, pick a big problem, you know, in the beginning of your career. And then, allow yourself to dream big, because you never know where it will take you. So as I begin my formal presentation, I'm going to start with several images from a modern Chinese artist whose work I've become inspired by. He's- to me he's a fascinating figure. His name is Ai Weiwei, I don't know if any of you know of his work. Several of- OK. So, I'll present in a snippet, he is not just an artist, but a human rights activist, and his work is scathingly anti-Chinese government and anti-traditional Chinese culture. And so, I would love to show this one image of his work today, but I can't do it in a public setting. So basically, if you can envision being at Tiananmen Square, in Beijing, and there's this huge portrait of Mao Saito,[SP] right? And so this is an iconic photo of his, there's a big picture- so he's taking a picture from Tiananmen Square, and basically he has his middle finger, OK, [laughs] right next to this photo, and you know it's his middle finger. So, he's not particularly loved by the Chinese government, he has been jailed several times, and again his work is just contentious and provocative. So, about a month ago, I went to see his latest exhibit, at a New York gallery, and it's called Sunflower Seeds. And, I was expecting the same kind of, you know, very controversial type of art, in terms of, you know, very inflammatory and just inciting, you know, emotions against what's traditional in China's society. 

00:06:10
SUNFLOWER SEEDS (NYC) 

00:06:10
LAWRENCE YANG So, I was struck by something very different. The Sunflower Seeds have a very powerful meaning within traditional China. Sunflowers follow the sun, so during the cultural evolution, these were meant to represent the Chinese people. What we have here are millions of porcelain sunflower seeds, and they are each handpainted individually. So, artisans within China, within a specific village in China actually, you know, created this, as part of this installation. When you're actually in it's presence, it's a little blurry but it's incredibly soothing, and beautiful, and to me it was actually quite shocking because- because of his prior work that I was familiar with. So, and what it- to me what it represents is that there are many Chinese in the world, you know there are regional differences, there are migrational differences, people come from different countries. They're people of part Chinese heritage, but within even considering all of this individual particularities, you know when you take a step back you can view the tapestry as a whole. We all have claimed to what it is to be Chinese, and this is a metaphor that I'll be using throughout today's presentation. 

00:07:35
SUNFLOWER SEEDS 

00:07:35
LAWRENCE YANG This is a closer view of some of the sunflower seeds, so you can actually see that, you know, they're distinct, and their shading and their stripes. OK. So let me move on, Asian to Asian Americans, so in terms of Asian American groups, immigration has been increasing steadily, since beginning in the 1800's, but within the last several decades has been growing enormously. So, in particular, they come from this, the Chinese specifically hail from this one region of China, from Fuzhou, and we refer to these Chinese as Fuzhounese Chinese. 

00:08:15
MAP OF CHINA Fujian Province located in southeastern China Across from Taiwan straits Mountainous, not good for farming Near coast 

00:08:15
LAWRENCE YANG So, where is this? So this province is actually located in southeastern China. The geographic particularities are important here because, first of all, it's located across the Taiwan strait, so it's close to Taiwan, it's close to Hong Kong. They have a long history of immigration out of the province. What happens as well, is that this region is very mountainous, so it's not easy for people to make a living, unless they're in the main cities. There's a great social pressure for young people, within this community, to leave the country and seek their fortunes elsewhere. How does it occur? 

00:09:00
COMPLEX SYSTEM OF SMUGGLING A network of smugglers (shetou or snakehead) working together in multiple countries Skyrocketing costs Smuggling methods consist of travel by sea, land, air 

00:09:00
LAWRENCE YANG How does it occur? Well there is extensive international networks, smuggling network, known as the snakeheads or shetou. And so, they're based in China, but they work together, linked across multiple countries. What happens is that, the costs of coming into the United States are extrodinary, especially after 9/11, so these days it's actually 80,000 dollars in order to come to the United States. And if the migrant doesn't pay this off, then they're a threat of violence, death, execution against the family and themselves. So, this group these circumstances really shape the particularities again that this immigrant group faces. When we- I talk about Chinese generally, but here, you know, in some instances I will be talking about this particular group, and the circumstances that they face. Again, they hail from this larger Chinese tapestry, but they have a particularly adverse set of circumstances that they live with. The smuggling methods are of all different means, and it typically can take years for them to come into the United States, and often times it's traumatic. People may suffer from PTSD as a result. 

00:10:15
ASIANS IN NYC Asians -11.8% of NYC's population Approximately 1,038,388 Asians in NYC NYC home to 659,596 overseas Chinese 

00:10:15
LAWRENCE YANG In terms of Asians within New York City, so once they get here, Asians are approximately 12 percent of the Chinese population. There are about a million Asians within New York City, and about 660,000 are Chinese in origin. You can see here that within the deep purple are the Chinese groups, where they congregate, and so we have within Queens, we have China town here, but also we have in southern Manhattan we have what's known as little Fuzhou. This is the first port of entry for many Fuzhounese individuals. What happens is that they come into New York as the first landing point. There's a whole host of services that are set out for them, and then literally, then they scatter to the rest of the country. Because in search of, in search of work because they have to pay off this crushing 80,000 dollar debt. .. Let me introduce this notion of what I call core lived values, or core social engagements that, sort that cultural groups engage in, and I'll use the Fuzhounese group as a vivid example of this. So this is a meta philantropalogical[SP] concept where people within a social group they engage in these daily activities that basically define personhood for them. It defines to be a part of this group means to engage in these activities. 

00:11:55
FOUR POST-MIGRATION GOALS 1. Pay off migration/travel debts 2. Send money to natal families in China 3. Perpetuate the familial lineage 4. Attain legal status in US 

00:11:55
LAWRENCE YANG So to be Fuzhounese, you must number one pay off your migration travel debts, once you've done that then you send money to your natal family in China. Then assuming that goes well, you seek to perpetuate the family lineage, so you sponsor a spouse, or excuse me a wife, from China and then you have to pay her smuggling debt too. Alright? Yes it's great to be a Fuzhounese guy. And then lastly when you finally accumulate enough resources, and this is kind of a mystery to me, I'm not sure how it happens. But apparently, it's possible for you to purchase U.S. citizenship status. OK. And this again, these are the core set of engagements that this group enacts every single day. OK. So that's the context for Chinese for the Fuzhounese, for this tapestry, let me shift over stigma. And so, in my story, I came to Columbia to work with Bruce Link, Dr. Bruce Link in epidemiology and he is one of the worlds experts in stigma and mental illness. So I came to work with him because I wanted to learn all about stigma in terms of how to understand it from a mainstream perspective so that I could take these theories and then apply it to Chinese groups. What is most applicable to Chinese groups? 

00:13:15
STIGMA AND ITS EFFECTS ON RECOVERY The Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health (1999): "[Stigmatization] reduces patients' access to resources and opportunities (e.g., housing, jobs) and leads to low self-esteem, isolation, hopelessness, outright discrimination and abuse. More tragically, it deprives people of their dignity and interferes with their full participation in society." 

00:13:15
LAWRENCE YANG So I always begin- I like to begin with this quote; "The Surgeon General's report on mental health, stigma reduces patients' access to resources and opportunities. Leads to low self esteem, psychological consequences, more tragically it deprives people of their dignity and interferes with their full participation in society." In terms of stigma actually is played out within Chinese groups, there are particular, again, these social forces that many shape many Chinese groups' experience of, you know, interacting with one another. 

00:13:50
STIGMA IN CHINESE SOCIETIES Confucianism Individual's role in a society To achieve a harmonious society Face Stereotypes of Dangerousness and Incompetent 

00:13:50
LAWRENCE YANG The first is that of confucianism, so that we can understand this as obligations, family obligations to one another. Especially filial piety, where children are obligated to their parents for raising them, but then are also obligated to continue their family line, their descent, their family lineage; not just by having- marrying, working, marrying and having children, but also maintaining the family's face, by bringing social resources to the family line. Once you achieve this, then you can participate in society. 

00:14:30
STIGMA AND ITS EFFECTS ON RECOVERY The Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health (1999): "[Stigmatization] reduces patients' access to resources and opportunities (e.g., housing, jobs) and leads to low self-esteem, isolation, hopelessness, outright discrimination and abuse. More tragically, it deprives people of their dignity and interferes with their full participation in society." 

00:14:30
LAWRENCE YANG To fulfill these obligations is to have face, and face is the essential calling; it's essential, basically, calling card, to enable you to participate in these social networks within Chinese groups, it's essential for social survival. So how does this interact with mental illness stigma? 

00:14:50
STIGMA AND ITS EFFECTS ON RECOVERY The Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health (1999): "[Stigmatization] reduces patients' access to resources and opportunities (e.g., housing, jobs) and leads to low self-esteem, isolation, hopelessness, outright discrimination and abuse. More tragically, it deprives people of their dignity and interferes with their full participation in society." 

00:14:50
LAWRENCE YANG You know, in one very basic way. All groups think, unfortunately, think that people with mental illness are dangerous and unpredictable, and incompetent. And so within Chinese groups, this has a particular meaning, because, this incompetence, this dangerousness leads them, leads other people to view them, as not being able to uphold these obligations, they lose their face. And then they can- in extreme situations, suffer a social death, which I'll get into in a little bit. 

00:15:15
INTERNALIZED STIGMA Stigma -set of interrelated social processes- including: labeling, stereotyping, cognitive separating, emotional reactions, status loss and discrimination, and power (Link and Phelan, 2001). 

00:15:15
LAWRENCE YANG In terms of stigma, there are a lot of ways of thinking about it, but this is the primary theory that I use. So we have Bruce Link and Joe Phelans' definitions, so labeling, stereotyping, cognitive separation, emotional reactions, status loss, discrimination and power. As you can see, these constructs range from processes that occur within the individual all the way to macro social forces within society. And today I'm going to be talking about two main components. 

00:15:45
INTERNALIZED STIGMA Stigma -set of interrelated social processes- including: labeling, stereotyping, cognitive separating, emotional reactions, status loss and discrimination, and power (Link and Phelan, 2001). Two main components: 1)Negative stereotyping leads to internalized processes of stigma 

00:15:45
LAWRENCE YANG First of all negative stereotyping and how this leads to internalized stigma. This is, I think, one of the main processes in which Chinese groups are effected by stigma. 

00:15:55
INTERNALIZED STIGMA Stigma -set of interrelated social processes- including: labeling, stereotyping, cognitive separating, emotional reactions, status loss and discrimination, and power (Link and Phelan, 2001). Two main components: 1)Negative stereotyping leads to internalized processes of stigma 2)Experienced Discrimination when individuals treat others unfairly 

00:15:55
LAWRENCE YANG Secondly is that of experienced discrimination, and this is what we commonly think of as stigma. In terms of pupilitives[SP] treat, a person with mental illness in an unfair way; I don't want to be your friend, I'm not going to give you a job. What's critical about internalized stigma, is that it can adversely effect individuals, even if there's- if nobody treats you in a bad way. 

00:16:20
INTERNALIZED STIGMA Internalized stigma takes place through stigmatized individuals themselves once they become aware of stereotypes and apply stereotypes to themselves. 

00:16:20
LAWRENCE YANG So essentially, even if you're aware that other people are holding these stereotypes about mentally ill groups, this actually- just the mere awareness and the application of these stereotypes to negative consquences. 

00:16:35
MODIFIED LABELING THEORY Labeled: societal conceptions become relevant to self Labeled individual's response -e.g., secrecy, withdrawal Negative consequences for self-esteem, earning power, or social network ties Vulnerability to new disorder or to repeat episodes of existing disorder Societal conceptions of what it means to be a mental patient: perceptions of devaluation discrimination Not Labeled: societal conceptions are irrelevant to self No consequences due to labeling 

00:16:35
LAWRENCE YANG And this theory illustrates this by Bruce Link, so essentially, and let me walk you through it because it really underlies so much of the rest of the presentation. 

00:16:40
MODIFIED LABELING THEORY Labeled: societal conceptions become relevant to self Labeled individual's response -e.g., secrecy, withdrawal Negative consequences for self-esteem, earning power, or social network ties Vulnerability to new disorder or to repeat episodes of existing disorder Societal conceptions of what it means to be a mental patient: perceptions of devaluation discrimination Not Labeled: societal conceptions are irrelevant to self No consequences due to labeling 

00:16:40
LAWRENCE YANG So if you grew up in a Chinese society, so we're in this first box here, and so people with mental illness, you know, are dangerous, they're unpredictable, they can't work, common stereotypes that are held. OK. Well so what? So I grew up in the society but I actually never had mental illness, so no big deal, you know these stereotypes exist but they don't apply to me, no big deal, no consequences. 

00:17:00
MODIFIED LABELING THEORY Labeled: societal conceptions become relevant to self Labeled individual's response -e.g., secrecy, withdrawal Negative consequences for self-esteem, earning power, or social network ties Vulnerability to new disorder or to repeat episodes of existing disorder Societal conceptions of what it means to be a mental patient: perceptions of devaluation discrimination Not Labeled: societal conceptions are irrelevant to self No consequences due to labeling 

00:17:00
LAWRENCE YANG However, if I have the misfortune of developing psychotic symptoms, then I show up at the hospital, and I have a psychiatrist tell me, oh you have schizophrenia, all of a sudden these conceptions they become relavent to who I am. They become relevant to oh my gosh I'm going to go meet my friend for coffee, or whatever, what are they going to think about me? What is my- what are my employers going to think about me? And so, the critical thing here is that nobodies treated this person in a negative way yet, it's just mere awareness that people are going to treat, are likely to treat him or her this way, that leads to negative coping responses. 

00:17:35
MODIFIED LABELING THEORY Labeled: societal conceptions become relevant to self Labeled individual's response -e.g., secrecy, withdrawal Negative consequences for self-esteem, earning power, or social network ties Vulnerability to new disorder or to repeat episodes of existing disorder Societal conceptions of what it means to be a mental patient: perceptions of devaluation discrimination Not Labeled: societal conceptions are irrelevant to self No consequences due to labeling 

00:17:35
LAWRENCE YANG So for instance secrecy and withdrawal being two prominent, harmful coping responses. These in turn lead to a cluster of negative outcomes, so negative self-esteem, effecting earning power, so people with mental- you know, they may not go out and seek jobs, or educational opportunities, also social network ties. in terms of socializing with other people. This cluster of negative outcomes then predisposes individuals to being vulnerable to future relapse... 

00:18:05
MODIFIED LABELING THEORY Labeled: societal conceptions become relevant to self Labeled individual's response -e.g., secrecy, withdrawal Negative consequences for self-esteem, earning power, or social network ties Vulnerability to new disorder or to repeat episodes of existing disorder Societal conceptions of what it means to be a mental patient: perceptions of devaluation discrimination Not Labeled: societal conceptions are irrelevant to self No consequences due to labeling 

00:18:05
INTERNALIZED STIGMA Internalized Stigma Self esteem Self Esteem (19 Studies) r= -.55 Self-Efficacy (17 Studies) r= -.54 Quality of Life (13 studies) r= -.47 Depressive Symptoms (11 Studies) r= -.41 Treatment Adherence r= .38 Psychosocial (4 Studies) Medication (3 Studies) Social Support (3 Studies) r= .28 Social Integration Social Network 

00:18:05
LAWRENCE YANG This is taken from a medded[SP] analysis, there's a lot of evidence at this point mental illness stigma and it's specifically internalized stigma leads to negative outcome. Psychological consequences you can see up here, and their whole host of studies. Leads to negative treatment adherence, psychosocial and medication, and also a decrease in social support. OK. So another step in the story. 2005 I was awarded a K-award by NIH, so five year grant to study Chinese immigrants with psychosis and as Dr. Lau had mentioned, this is, you know, one of the first- this is actually the first study among Asian Americans with psychotic disorder. 

00:18:50
STIGMA RESEARCH K-AWARD STUDY (2006-2010) Two Chinese bilingual inpatient units Individuals with Psychotic spectrum disorder Key relative who co-resides w/consumer 56 families 53 consumer-family dyads Questionnaires Consumer-Stigma (internalized consumer/family, experienced) Relatives- Explanatory model, Expressed Emotion, Stigma (Internalized consumer/family, experienced) 

00:18:50
LAWRENCE YANG So what we did is we spent time on two Chinese bilingual inpatient units, and we interviewed people- inviduals with a psychotic spectrum disorder, and a key relative who co-resides with the consumer. We interviewed 56 family members, excuse me, families, 53 complete consumer-family dyads, and we gave them a whole host of questionnaires. So we have, for the consumer, we gave them a questionnaire on stigma in terms of internalized stigma, or anticipated stigma, towards both the consumer but then also toward the families. So how much stigma with the family expect to face, and then also experience stigma, so do people actually treat them badly. 

00:19:35
STIGMA RESEARCH K-AWARD STUDY (2006-2010) Two Chinese bilingual inpatient units Individuals with Psychotic spectrum disorder Key relative who co-resides w/consumer 56 families 53 consumer-family dyads Questionnaires Consumer-Stigma (internalized consumer/family, experienced) Relatives- Explanatory model, Expressed Emotion, Stigma (Internalized consumer/family, experienced) 

00:19:35
LAWRENCE YANG For the relatives we had an involved battery, so explanatory model, expressed emotion, so this was a family affect, and then also the different forms of stigma. Oh sorry, I just wanted to, this project was excruciatingly difficult to do. I now understand why there's never been a study on Asian American psychosis, because nobody will talk with you [laughs]. We spent four years on the units and literally, you know, we had to try to engage people however we could, and just over time- you know actually the thing is that made it work, was the fact that we did the project on the inpatient unit. Because these interviews were hours long, and so once the consumer would recompensate then it would be cool to, you know, talk with us, 'cause they had nothing else to do, they were bored. And then the family members who just come and hang out, you know come and see the consumer like every week or so? We would grab them an hour at a time, hour at a time, hour at a time. Oh when is the next time you're going to see him? Oh great you want to talk with us for an hour. So, just overtime we're able to compile this data. And, you know, we really hope to move the field forward now that we finally have it. 

00:20:50
STIGMA RESEARCH K-AWARD STUDY (2006-2010) Consumers 82% Chinese speaking; 63% male 34.4 years old, $9,000/year, 12.6 yrs in U.S. 9 years illness, 5.2 hospitalizations Relatives 28 parents, 6 spouses, 22 "other" 48.8 years old, $18,000/year, 16.1 yrs in U.S. 80% co-reside w/ consumer 

00:20:50
LAWRENCE YANG So who are they? Just some characteristics, so mostly Chinese speaking, mostly male. 34 years old, poor, lived- had been in the U.S. for a long time, pretty sick, 9 years of illness or five hospitalizations. For the relatives there are 28 parents, excuse me, half parents half "other", in terms of relations. About 50 years old, again, poor, been in the U.S. for a while, most of them live with the consumer. I wanted, originally, to do an anti-stigma intervention with the consumers, that was always the purpose and the dream. But the thing is, you know very quickly it became evident that we couldn't realistically do it. When the consumers would come into New York, as I mentioned to you before they would immediately go out and work. And I'm not joking with you the Chinese restaurant system in the United States is like McDonalds, OK? You can work in South Dakota, if you- you can work in North Carolina, you can work in Ohio, you're going to find McDonalds anywhere. Basically it's the same thing like this Fuzhounese restaurant chain, it's crazy. So what happens is that they get- they literally as soon as they're in New York, as soon as they get well, they get out of the hospital, boom they're on a bus and then they're working in Ohio. So, it's really difficult it was almost- it just is incredibly difficult to engage this group. So what we've done instead is we've- our initial step has been to focus on the family members. 

00:22:15
FOCUS ON RELATIVES Chinese relatives found to be highly involved in consumer's care and use of medications (Lin 1991) Relatives will have more consistent contract with consumer over time. 

00:22:15
LAWRENCE YANG And the reasons being that first of all, they're highly involved, of course they're in the consumer's care. Secondly they will have consistent contact with the consumer over time. OK. So, at this point, you know, everything I have been reading, you- is so interesting, our field is informed by, oh just what people think will happen. You know what I mean? And then actually need the data to actually demonstrate what is it, or is it not, and there's so many- there have been a lot of writings talking about how family members are contaminated to the same extent as, you know consumers with mental illness. Well I wanted to see if that was true, so the first thing actually did suggest that it was true. OK. 

00:23:00
K-AWARD STUDY- STIGMA FINDINGS 71% agreed "better off not telling others about it" 30% kept it within the family 10% told no one Relatives Extensive use of secrecy 

00:23:00
LAWRENCE YANG At least an element of it, and that's that the relatives tend to used extensively used secrecy as a coping mechanism. And again keep in mind Bruce Links model that, again when the stereotypes are so severely negative of course you're going to be secretive you're not going to tell other people. 

00:23:15
K-AWARD STUDY- STIGMA FINDINGS 71% agreed "better off not telling others about it" 30% kept it within the family 10% told no one Relatives Extensive use of secrecy 

00:23:15
LAWRENCE YANG So 71 percent of relatives, and I'm going to present this next set in basically very descriptive statistics, but I think it tells the main story. I want to keep it simple. So 71 percent agreed that you're better off not telling others about it. 30 percent within this larger group kept it within the family, so they never told anybody else outside their nuclear extended family. And strikingly ten percent of the relatives that we interviewed told nobody at all, the first time- not even another family member, the first time they spoke of their loved one's mental illness was in an interview with us. So I was always struck by those interviews, and wondered how this could even possibly be. Why are they so fearful? OK. So what is this all about? Are they feared for themselves, what's going on? So here, again, we gave the relatives a set of different stigma batteries right? So we could really pinpoint what was happening. 

00:24:10
K-AWARD STUDY-STIGMA FINDINGS, RELATIVE Experienced Internalized family Internalized consumer 

00:24:10
LAWRENCE YANG And so here you can see in terms of experience stigma, thanks to the- you guys' posters by the way, Alright? We've found that, actually relatives endorse very little unfair treatment themselves. Less than ten percent across twelve domains as an example, so eight percent of relatives are shunned or avoided. This is pretty low, in terms of anticipated stigma by relatives, towards, you know, towards themselves, it's actually fairly low as well between 24 and 40 percent, as an example. So 40 percent of relatives think the family members will lose face. OK. So that's not low, but nor is it extraordinarily high, so what was going on here if the family members, you know, weren't fearful for themselves, they weren't anticipating stigma towards themselves. Well, of course the answer is that they were fearful for their loved ones. 

00:25:00
K-AWARD STUDY-STIGMA FINDINGS, RELATIVE Experienced Internalized family Internalized consumer 

00:25:00
LAWRENCE YANG You can see here in terms of their anticipated stigma towards the loved ones, it's got high. 86 percent of relatives thought that employers would not hire a person with mental illness. 98 percent felt that most young women would not marry a person with mental illness. So this really guided our intervention, all right we wanted to help the relatives cope with their own sense of stigmatization but we also wanted to help them in terms of really targeting terms of, you know, their loved one's well being. 

00:25:25
K-AWARD STUDY-STIGMA FINDINGS, CONSUMERS "Shunned or avoided" 45% "Looked down upon by Family Members" 45% Experienced Stigma Endorsed 10-45% Internalized family "Would look down on" 61% "Most Young Women would not marry" 78% Internalized consumer 

00:25:25
LAWRENCE YANG Our interpretations were pretty- were for the most part- corroborated by the findings among the consumer. So here you can see that the consumers themselves experienced much more discrimination than the relatives. So 45% were shunned or avoided, or looked down upon by family members. In terms of internalized stigma, again, so the family. The consumers didn't actually anticipate that much stigma towards the family, so it was between 10 and 45 percent. 

00:25:50
K-AWARD STUDY-STIGMA FINDINGS, CONSUMERS "Shunned or avoided" 45% "Looked down upon by Family Members" 45% Experienced Stigma Endorsed 10-45% Internalized family "Would look down on" 61% "Most Young Women would not marry" 78% Internalized consumer 

00:25:50
LAWRENCE YANG In terms of anticipated stigma towards themselves, you can see it's moderately high, so 61% felt that other, you know, community members would look down on the consumer, and then 78% felt that most young women would not marry a consumer. So to drive this point home, so the relatives they really weren't particular concerned- overly concerned about the stigma towards themselves, instead they were most interested in protecting the consumer from stigma. 

00:26:25
K-AWARD STUDY- OTHER FINDINGS Relatives not concerned for stigma re: self Instead, protecting consumer from stigma Younger sister about female relative: "Chinese people say, 'If she is crazy and not yet married, and if you tell others she is sick, no one will marry her.' One person finding out will spread to others. So I don't want others to know. Even her friends I won't tell." [Interviewer: "Will others look down on you?"] "They won't look down on me. [Instead they will think that] this person (sister) is finished. This person is someone who has no future. It's as if she has died." 

00:26:25
LAWRENCE YANG And this is a beautiful quote, well, it's a tragic quote, but its beautiful as well in that- of a sister, about her ill relative. So this is translated from Chinese; Chinese people say if she's crazy and not yet married, and if you tell others she is sick, no one will marry her. One person finding out will spread to others. So I don't want others to know. Even her friends I won't tell. So I asked, will the others look down on you? They won't look down on me. Instead they will think that this person, my sister, is finished. This person is someone who has no future. It's as if she has died. OK. So, when I talk about- I talk- stigma is bad in all groups, you know, but then people say, oh well you know, how could it be worse than the Chinese group? Well [laughs] this is how it's worse. Because what happens is that it's a metaphorical death, the person doesn't- ceases to exist. This is at the extreme of what can happen. 

00:27:15
K-AWARD STUDY- OTHER FINDINGS 1) Almost 40% of Relative labeled symptomatology as a non-MI problem (/ of Nervous and Mental Disease, 2011) 2) Endorsement of indigenous causes led to less frequent identification of MI problem (Community MH Journal, in press) 3) Relative's internalized stigma significantly associated with consumer's internalized stigma (Psychiatric Services, in progress) 

00:27:15
LAWRENCE YANG Other findings from the study that we're producing a bunch of results from at the moment. So 40% of relatives, so this was strikingly high. 40 percent of relatives didn't even identify the person's problem was a mental disorder, right, even though they've been hospitalized, on average, five times. Incredible. Endorsement of indigenous causes actually lead to worse identification of mental illness problems. And then lastly, and again this underlies, helps us motivate our intervention, is that relatives internalized stigma is, significantly associated with consumer's internalized stigma. So if we're able to affect stigma within the relatives, hopefully it can in turn affect the consumer's sense of their own selves. OK. In 2007, I had the opportunity to work with Arthur Climan, a prominent medical anthropologist at Harvard and we really sat down and we thought about how do you, how can we frame culture and it's impacts upon stigma, you know, is this possible, can we create a theory for it? And so what we did was we wrote a paper just describing that. Although stigma impacts people across a myriad of domains, so work, socializing, internalized processes, where it hurts people the most, where it's felt the most powerfully is among these core lived engagements, that people have to participate in, in order to be seen as, you know, a real individual, an adult individual within their world. So I'll just give you a very vivid example of this, the (inaudible ) of this work, is that again, for Fuzhounese they experience stigma all over the- you know, across all domains, right. 

00:29:05
FORMULATION Stigma acts in culture-specific ways to destroy an actor's capacity to take part in the core, everyday engagements that certify one as a fully viable (or "fully moral") member of a local community (Yang et al., 2007), Proposal: Stigma will coalesce most forcefully around a Fuzhounese individual's capacity to obtain competitive employment, repay his debt, and fulfill his filial obligations and extend his ancestral line. 

00:29:05
LAWRENCE YANG But where it hurts the most is around their capacity to obtain competitive employment, repay debt, fulfill their obligations, and extend his ancestral line. OK. And so this theory, even though we're illustrating it specifically, I think, you know, I believe that it has- we can utilize it cross-culturally. OK. In the last- so back to the story again, so in the past year or two we've been able to move on from these findings, they've guided our thinking in terms of you know, well, what can we do about it? Now we have the data, so let's actually create an intervention. So the last couple of years we've been focusing on this part. 

00:29:50
COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTION TO CONFRONT STIGMA 

00:29:50
OBJECTIVES We proposed a 3-session group treatment that utilizes empirically-tested principles. To increase knowledge of psychiatric disorders To reduce stigma specifically related to enhancing work and social recovery among Chinese immigrants. 

00:29:50
LAWRENCE YANG What we have done is we've proposed a three session group treatment that utilized empirically-tested principles, and we chose three sessions because, again, this group is so difficult to engage for an extended period of time. We just- we need, you know, to do something vocal and to engage them, but at the same time have enough time to actually do something meaningful. 

00:30:15
OBJECTIVES We proposed a 3-session group treatment that utilizes empirically-tested principles. To increase knowledge of psychiatric disorders To reduce stigma specifically related to enhancing work and social recovery among Chinese immigrants. 

00:30:15
LAWRENCE YANG So we had two purposes, first of all to increase the knowledge of psychiatric disorders, secondly to reduce stigma specifically related to enhancing work and social recovery, 'cause again we felt that this was most important...What's really novel about this intervention is that very recently, anti-stigma interventions had been developed, and one key component is that instead of a clinician presenting, you know, to people, saying oh you should get over your stigma, the core element is actually to have, in this case, a caregiver; someone, you know, who actually has a family member with a severe mental illness, have them work through their internalized stigma. OK. Train them, and then have them co-lead or lead, or co-lead the intervention with you. All right? This happens among majority white groups, at this point. We wanted to do it among Chinese groups, [sighs] I was told probably many times, you know, by very knowledgeable people actually, and you know, they didn't think that it could happen. You know, Chinese group was so secretive, why would you- how would a family member sort of come out about this to the rest of the community? You know thankfully I didn't listen to those people, [laughs] so what we did eventually was we actually found two caregivers. 

00:31:40
FAMILY CAREGIVER CO-LEADERS Identified and trained 2 Caregiver Co-leaders (NJ: Jan 2011; NY May 2011) Provided one-on-one psycho education 4 sessions, 2 months total Concurrently participated in caregiver mutual support group 

00:31:40
LAWRENCE YANG One within New York and New Jersey, we trained them in the psycho educational strategy, so four sessions, two months total. And they concurrently participated in a caregiver support group. I also want to note, OK. Eventually I've really hoped- so, OK. Our focus was to really create an intervention, just test this, can it work, can we engage Chinese families, can we show that this, you know, has a chance of working? And so what we did first as this initial step, is we actually recruited from pre-existing caregiver organizations. So we have, we recruited from New York City, Chinatown, psychoeducational support group, this amazing grass root support group that has existed for eight to ten years. 

00:32:25
INTERVENTION (PILOT DATA) Two recruitment sites: NYC Chinatown NAMI-NJ (Chinese outreach) 

00:32:25
LAWRENCE YANG We also recruited from National Alliance of Mentally Ill, New Jersey, they have the most active Chinese immigrant outreach program within the United States. 

00:32:35
INTERVENTION (PILOT DATA) Two recruitment sites: NYC Chinatown NAMI-NJ (Chinese outreach) Ran 3 groups New Jersey group: 3 relatives; Jan-Feb 2011 New York Group: 5 relatives; Aug 2011 New York group: 3 relatives; Sept-Oct 2011 

00:32:35
LAWRENCE YANG And we've ran through groups in the past year, so one in New Jersey, and two within New York. 

00:32:40
PILOT DATA RELATIVES (N=11) Relatives 10 parents, 1 husband 4 FT employed, 2 PT employed, 3 retired, 2 unemployed 2 completed 8th grade, 2 completed HS, 6 completed college 59.2 yrs (SD=9.2) Only 2/11 relatives Fuzhounese 

00:32:40
LAWRENCE YANG Just to give you a sense of who these people are, we have ten parents, excuse me, mostly parents, they are range of employment, more educated you can see than, for instance, our Fuzhounese group. About 60 years old, and again only two out of eleven of these relatives were Fuzhounese. Again, in the spirit of, you know, feasibility testing, we just worked with the relatives that we could get. However, you know, I hope that- my dream is to be able to circle back and to craft something specifically for the Fuzhounese group. 

00:33:10
PILOT DATA PATIENTS (N=11) Consumers: 6 female, 5 male 9 never married; 1 married; 1 divorced 2 PT employed, 7 unemployed; 2 student 2 completed 8th grade; 6 HS; 2 college 30.6 (9.5) yrs old; illness onset 20.9 (9.7) yrs 9 hospitalized, 2 unhospitalized 3.7 (3.1) times hospitalized (range 0-10) 

00:33:10
LAWRENCE YANG In terms of their loved ones, OK. We're not in the intervention to be clear, but just to give you a sense of who they were, mixed in terms of gender. Most were not married, most were unemployed, mixed of education, about 30 years old, 10 years of illness, 10 years of illness typically, most were hospitalized, and most were hospitalized 3.7 times. So again, it was- the consumers were fairly sick. 

00:33:40
THREE-SESSION GROUP TREATMENT Frequency: weekly 90-minute session. Group Leaders: one clinician and one more 'seasoned' relative caregiver. Participants: 3-5 relatives whose ill family member suffers from sever mental illness. 

00:33:40
LAWRENCE YANG In terms of the treatment format itself, we had- we used a weekly 90-minute session and we had a group caregiver co-leader. So we had one clinician, and one seasoned family caregiver. There were three to five naive relatives, whose family members suffered from mental illness, per group. So in terms- the first topic was that of- so wait, session one; because the mental health literacy in this group is so poor, we just wanted to start at a baseline level, so what, you know, what are symptoms, what are the prospects of recovery? So we basically presented focal psycho education around proper medication use, and it's role in restoring patient functioning. 

00:34:30
SESSION 1 EDUCATION TOPICS 1. Information about Proper Medication Use and its Role in Restoring Patient Functioning 2. Recovery from an episode of Schizophrenia *Indirectly addresses stigma-- improves understanding of MI to counter stereotypes 

00:34:30
LAWRENCE YANG Recovery from an episode of schizophrenia, and this actually laid the foundation for the later anti-stigma work, because we were providing them facts, we're providing them you know, you have- your relative actually does have a possibility of recovering. Maybe not immediately but, you know, sort of over time. In our second session, this is actually where we dove in to actually, you know, countering stigma specifically. 

00:34:55
SESSION 2 Introduction of Discrimination Definition of discrimination Different forms of discrimination Social discrimination Employment-based discrimination 

00:34:55
LAWRENCE YANG And so here, we first defined discrimination for the relatives, and for them, actually, it was pretty intuitive, they understood, you know, what it was to be treated unfairly. And then also, but we really focused specifically on social discrimination and employment based discrimination. 

00:35:10
SESSION 2 2. Provide problem-solving tools Locating and keeping employment and social recovery Facilitate coping with experiences of discrimination Analyzing the specific thoughts, feelings, and behaviors Sharing effective coping strategies 

00:35:10
LAWRENCE YANG We tried to give the relatives problem solving tools, so in terms of, first of all just very pragmatic things, so how do you locate, how do you keep employment, how do you you know, sort of keep your social recovery going. But we also provided them a method by which, you know, to really cope better with discrimination. So we gave them this thing called, this sort of behavioral triangle. So there are thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and what we would do, is we would walk the relatives through an instance of discrimination they may have encountered. And then we have them think through, oh what were you thinking at the time, how did you respond emotionally, what did you do? And then we had them problem solve in reverse, so you know, to have them actually come up with more adaptive ways of, you know, approaching the problem. So that- and that in turn would change the way they felt, in turn might change the way they were to behave in the future. So this was our primary way of trying to give them- to get them to share with one another, effective coping strategies. The third session, so this is actually where we tried to attack the internalized stigma, which is really you know, one of the fundamental aspects of this entire intervention. So, I thought this part was really cool, and we weren't sure it was going to work, but the relatives actually grasped it. So, as many of you know, CBT is a therapy technique that utilizes- that identifies automatic thoughts, and then trains people to recognize these misinterpretations or cognitive distortions. And then teaches them, basically, reasoning processes in order to counter them. So instead of in depression, where automatic thought might be oh well so, you know, I'm worthless, I'm hopeless, everything's hopeless, instead we replace that type of automatic thought with actually the stereotype of mental illness. 

00:37:10
SESSION 3 COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL APPROACH 1. Discussions on inaccurate stereotypes about mental illness Example: "people with mental illness cannot make significant contributions to society." 

00:37:10
LAWRENCE YANG So if you guys are following, a stereotype for instance that a relative might hold, so people with mental illness cannot make significant contributions to society. We would actually train the relatives to recognize these stereotypes as automatic cognitions that would come into their mind regarding their loved one. 

00:37:30
SESSION 3 COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL APPROACH 2. Introduce concept of "Automatic Thoughts" Illustrate the different types of automatic thoughts (i.e., "black-or-white" thinking) Facilitate a group discussion of experienced automatic thoughts specifically in relation to their ill relative's social and work functioning 

00:37:30
LAWRENCE YANG So what we did was we illustrated the different types of automatic thoughts, and then we facilitated group discussions to really counter these automatic thoughts specifically in relation to relative's social and work functioning. 

00:37:45
SESSION 3 COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL APPROACH 3. Teach how to challenge automatic thoughts "3 C's" approach: Catch it Check it Change it 

00:37:45
LAWRENCE YANG And there's a 3 C's approach. [laughs] So I'm going to walk you through an example, so relatives were taught to catch their cognitions first, so for instance a mother, this is a real example that occurred during one of the groups, a mother, her son was having trouble working at Dunken Donuts, OK. He was just struggling, just couldn't pay attention, unfortunately this symptom- he's still recovering from, you know, his latest episode. Mother was- you know, had this thought, oh my god my son's sick again, you know, he's never going to be able to work again, right? And so this is the stereotype, the cognition. So we asked mother, OK, well let's examine this cognition, is it really true that her son will never be able to work again, and so what happened was the mother was able to say well, you know, he actually- when he is stable, when he is actually recovered, to a better extend he can actually, you know, manage simpler jobs. 

00:38:45
SESSION 3 COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL APPROACH 3. Teach how to challenge automatic thoughts "3 C's" approach: Catch it Check it Change it 

00:38:45
LAWRENCE YANG So we had mother utilize that evidence to check her original cognition, and then, you know, could she modify her original cognition, and she could. She said well, you know, so he's having trouble right now, maybe we should cut down on his work, maybe we should take him out of the job, maybe we should, and then sort of you know, encourage him to find a job later on. And so, not only did this allow the mother to encounter her own sense of stigma, but it also encouraged her to act in a more encouraging way and adaptive way towards her loved one, which was the goal of the intervention. OK, so, wonderful, we all have this lovely theory, you know we actually went out and tested it and we actually had these nice clinical vignettes[SP] that show that, OK, maybe they are actually getting what we're trying to teach them. Does it work? 

00:39:35
PILOT RESULTS (N=11) Quantitative: Self-stigma: "I agree that people should avoid caregivers of those who have mental illness" (range= 0-7) High Pre-stigma (3-7) t(5)=2.2, p=0.9 5.6 Pre: Score 3.8 Post: Score 

00:39:35
LAWRENCE YANG So these are very initial pilot results, and again, there are only 11 caregivers and one of the main outcomes that we looked at was self-stigma, so I agree. So for instance, I agree that people should avoid caregivers of those who have mental illness. So again, this scale ranges from zero to seven, I actually took out the people who were very low in it because it's impossible to- if they started at zero or one, or actually there were no twos, if they started at zero or one you can't get them to go any lower [laughs] so, I took them out of the analysis. 

00:40:10
PILOT RESULTS (N=11) Quantitative: Self-stigma: "I agree that people should avoid caregivers of those who have mental illness" (range= 0-7) High Pre-stigma (3-7) t(5)=2.2, p=0.9 5.6 Pre: Score 3.8 Post: Score 

00:40:10
LAWRENCE YANG So, we have the people who start off with high stigma, and the average 5.6 at pre-intervention, and then again among this very small group, we did lower their stigma to a 3.8 post intervention, and this is actually of trend significance, probably the best we could hope for given the small end. 

00:40:30
THE MOST HELPFUL... Two co-leaders complemented one another Participants stated that the clinician was a good informational resource Caregiver co-leader supplemented this information with problem-solving strategies and sharing real-life experiences "She (caregiver co-leader) has real-life experiences to share, it adds to the theory (presented by the clinician) and is helpful". 

00:40:30
LAWRENCE YANG In terms of the qualitative data, thankfully, the participant stated first of all, that the clinician was a good, you know, that the clinician was a good- that the paring of the clinician and the caregiver was actually a good thing. So that they felt that the clinician was a good informational resource, but the caregiver really supplemented this with problem solving from their real lives, real life experience. 

00:40:50
THE MOST HELPFUL... Two co-leaders complemented one another Participants stated that the clinician was a good informational resource Caregiver co-leader supplemented this information with problem-solving strategies and sharing real-life experiences "She (caregiver co-leader) has real-life experiences to share, it adds to the theory (presented by the clinician) and is helpful". 

00:40:50
LAWRENCE YANG And so this is a quote from one of the caregivers; She, the caregiver co-leader, has real-life experiences to share, it adds to the theory presented by the clinician, and is helpful. OK. So, next steps, and you know, goals and dreams really. So I hope, we hope, I have so many of my team members here, amazing team members, that have, you know, done a lot of work on this with me. 

00:41:20
NEXT STEPS Further refine and test intervention Distribute statewide with hopes of national distribution Pilot projects in China (Shanghai) and Indonesia (Jobya) 

00:41:20
LAWRENCE YANG To further, first of all, test and refine the intervention, we wanted to expand, not just- we wanted to recruit not from just caregiver groups, but also from the broader community. We want to expand the intervention from three sessions to five sessions, because even though three showed some effect, we really think that it's going to need more, we're going to need more time to really work at this deeply engrained stigma that's felt by Chinese families. The hope then, if we can actually show that it works, is it's distributed state wide, and again the dream is to distribute it nationally someday. 

00:42:00
NEXT STEPS Further refine and test intervention Distribute statewide with hopes of national distribution Pilot projects in China (Shanghai) and Indonesia (Jobya) 

00:42:00
LAWRENCE YANG What is encouraging, is currently I'm collaborating with another professor at Harvard, Byron Good, and he's starting these pilot projects both in China and Indonesia. 

00:42:10
NEXT STEPS Further refine and test intervention Distribute statewide with hopes of national distribution Pilot projects in China (Shanghai) and Indonesia (Jobya) 

00:42:10
LAWRENCE YANG The same, actually, design and it's actually based on our work in New York City. So I...first of all, I want to conclude my talk on, you know, first of all, a big thanks, and then sort of circling back to the original things I begun to talk with, in terms of, you know, my story and also social justice, right? 

00:42:40
THANK YOU Team members Ming Tu** Vanessa Li, MPH Huiting Liu Jiao Li Liven Wu. M.A. NJ-NAMI Maggie Luo, M.A. Ruthie Yu, R.N. 

00:42:40
LAWRENCE YANG So first of all I really want to thank my team members, you know, you guys are amazing and many of you are here in the audience, and I- you know, you've done incredible work and you know, we're going to push this forward together. I, in terms of, you know, my story, it's an amazing feeling to be here, you know? Sort of, you dream of something, a long time ago, you know, as a young person and maybe you think you can change something in the world that's of significance, and it's pretty amazing to have that opportunity, you know, to be able to do that, I hope. In terms of social justice, I also want to conclude on one last note. I, as Dr. Lau mentioned, I'm actually in the medical school, and so sadly the medical school doesn't really value this type of work, they care a lot more about genes, they care a lot more about biology, but I'm, you know, committed to seeing this through. There're a lot- there are things that I could do that would be a lot more rewarded within that setting, and but again, this is something that you know, I feel very strongly about. And so the thing is, I share this with you, because again, there are a lot of beginning clinicians and researchers in this audience, and you know someday you're going to encounter a situation where you run into an impoverished person, or someone who's greatly disadvantaged, either an individual or a group, and you're going to face a decision in terms of well, am I going to spend time and the resources to help this person, you know either my clinical practice, or my research. It's going to be extraordinarily difficult, and no one will even know, you know, no one will even know if you help this person or not, and I would say to you, I hope that you will give of yourself. It is our honor, and our obligation to care for the least privileged members of our society, and I hope that, you know, when that moment comes, for each of you, that you will embrace that obligation, and answer that call. So thank you for your attention. 

00:45:10
[clapping] 

00:45:10
LAWRENCE YANG The Fuzhounese group especially they almost never enter hospitalization through community mental health services, it's their first point of contact at actually through the hospital. So they had just gotten to the point where they're just so sick, that police, or you know, family member drags them in, or, you know, the wheels have fallen off the car basically at that point. 

00:45:40
K-AWARD STUDY- STIGMA FINDINGS, RELATIVE Experienced Internalized family "Most young women would not marry" Internalized consumer 

00:45:40
LAWRENCE YANG If the rest of the world thinks these things, you know, what can you do to change it? So I think that, you know, the way we tried to approach it, first of all, is to- you know to the best- to the extent that we can, we try to change this thinking, again, to the extent that we can. It's not always possible within the family members themselves, because then, you know, they can see that there's hope for the person, because work, OK. Maybe not the- you're right, it's hard to change other people's cognitions. You can't change the way other young women feel, you can't change the way the employers would feel. But, what you can do, and what we have tried to do, is we've tried to sort of reinforce these capacities among the consumers themselves. So if you noticed during an intervention, we keep coming- circling back to, you know, sort of work functioning, work- how do you maintain this sort of functioning, how can you, you know, hold on to this core capacity so that the rest of the Chinese world can see you as a real person? One other piece of this I think that sort of comes out of this question, is that, in the United States, it's seen as OK to talk about mental illness or just to be open about these things, and it's seen as not good to sort of be secretive, or you know, to withdraw from people. The thing is, is that what I've learned in working with the Chinese group, the Chinese immigrant group, is that- lost my train of thought, sorry. With the Chinese immigrant group, is that, actually being secretive is adaptive, because the rest of the world is going to be so rejecting, that you really have to, you know, pick your battles very very carefully. And so maybe you can tell some family members, maybe you can tell a couple of trusted, very close, trusted others, but otherwise you're right, you know, this type of change can only take place over a very very long period of time. And I know, I think the same things too sometimes, god this is a millennia worth of culture, how do you undo that, you know, how do you undo that sort of socialization? Well I will say to you, you know, hundreds of years ago, what'd I think, what sort of am I thinking about? Sorry, there are disorders that have been stigmatized over time, and that we've actually shifted a lot of our attitudes towards. I think- I'm thinking of cancer as an example, but I think there's actually another, more striking one that I can't quite call to mind quite yet. I think that, you know, with concerted effort, we can change this. You have to hope. 

00:48:20
K-AWARD STUDY- STIGMA FINDINGS 71% agreed "better off not telling others about it" 30% kept it within the family 10% told no one Relatives Extensive use of secrecy 

00:48:20
LAWRENCE YANG Again, going back to this concentric circle slide, [laughs] there's a range for sort of, adaptation for Chinese families, and you do not want to be in this circle, this is not normative, you know? And even this you could argue is probably expand it further beyond the family if you had some trusted individuals that you could tell. The question, of course, you have to use your judgment so that, you know, can you really trust these people? So, you know, most of the people that I saw that were better adapted, accessed more resources from the community at large, they either told a other family members, or, and told other people, just two or three maybe, very very close friends about- about the person's mental illness, and in that way they were really able to derive really crucial support. So I hear your point, but I also don't think that, we can't buy into this paradime that, you know, it's so engrained within Chinese, you know, that anything shameful, don't tell anybody. [laughs] You know? Don't tell anybody. The question is, is that we really want to get to, not whether most people think it, in this case whether you think it. You know, the relative, do you hold this to be true, do you hold this to be absolutely true, you know? And again, in CVT we always identify black and white thinking, very very few things are absolutely true, you know, and so we're always trying to find the gray. Is there something that- is there a capacity that could be preserved, you know, among the loved ones. It's not always possible, sometimes people are really impaired, the illness is real, you know, people can't- some people can't work, that's just how it is. You know, and so with those, cases you have to be- it's tricky, we can't sell people false hope, you're right. But at the same time, I think there's just so many assumptions that are made by family members that go unquestioned, and I think that's really at the crux of all this. And it comes also from this fact that they're so misinformed, you know, they have this way of thinking about mental illness that's very archaic, it has nothing to do with, you know, our own understanding of how there're possibilities of recovery, even for psychotic disorders. I think one of the- and Ming touches on a really critical point here, what was critical to whether these groups worked, or didn't, because some went better than others, quite frankly, is whether or not we have the right caregiver. You know what I mean? Because some caregivers did not buy in fully, in fact sometimes, some of the caregivers would be like, they'd start agreeing about the stereotypes. They'd be like yeah, keep them away from sharp objects, yeah [laughs] (inaudible ) are dangerous, you can't trust them in a kitchen by themselves. And I'm like, oh god, I can't believe this is like our co-leader [laughs] saying this. So, but you know, this is sort of, you have to, you're continually working at this. This is the first run of interventions, hopefully, you know, we'll continue to sort of work on our caregiver co-leaders as well, but that is an essential element of it, and without them it's almost- it's extrodinarly difficult without them. One of the caregivers co-leaders, or not co-leaders, one of the caregivers actually carried around a story, like of a, of his- her son being discharged from the hospital, and she would actually show that to other caregivers. You know, sort of be like- and we thought that was a lovely way of, you know sort of telling her story through this, you know, through this written story, as you so nicely describe. We did toy, I'll be honest with you two, we did toy with the idea, so NAMI what they do actually, is to have this lovely thing that's a testimonial where they have five different families, actually they have a 20 minute video tape and each family member talks about their experience with stigma, they've created it, it's standardized, it's not standardized, but it's pretty- this one tape that they use now, and they've tested it, and it works. So we were thinking about doing the same thing for the Chinese group, in terms of actually creating a testimonial, but we thought that, and maybe we could still do that, there's no reason not to, but I think that, again, the power of the intervention is being pointed out as really an interaction. The caregiver- it's that they see the caregiver in a position of power within the group, and then they're able to associate, to identify with that person, and so, you know, that's really essential. You know, I had my- I wasn't sure if it was going to work, you know, in the beginning, and so I didn't know how they'd react to that. But, I'm now convinced that it's an essential element.

What about creating a sheltered employment program for this community?

LAWRENCE YANG That is a beautiful question, I wish you were the mayor of our city, or you know, governor of our state. Because, honestly, and I got asked this question a couple of days ago too, they were- you know, we're in this sort of stigma group, that discusses structural discrimination versus sort of culture. Where does one start, where does one end? And it was so funny because one gentlemen asked me, he said so, what are you going to do? You know this group has such incredible sort of circumstances against them. Are you going to work with the culture- are you going to try and work through the culture, are you going to try to- and I said you know what? We have to work with the culture, but if I could dream of a world, I would dream of actually, exactly what you said. You know, sheltered employment, for Chinese speaking individuals, who are illegal,[laughs] within New York City, you know what? That would make our lives so much easier, because then they would stay put,[laughs] and then we could actually work with them, you know, to actually adhere to medications, and you know, see their therapist, and you know, reduce their stigma instead of jumpiing on the bus and going, you know, to another state because they have to. You know, again, so again, you're right, we have to- those efforts, I think, have to take place in parallel. I've had a lot of days obviously, thinking about this, so this is the best that I think we can do right now, you know, is to strengthen the family, you know what kind of support can they give the individual, Someday, again, you know, maybe it might be possible. All right then, thanks so much for your attention, feel free to come up and talk with me afterwards.
