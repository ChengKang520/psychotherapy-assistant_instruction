JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Hi, my name is John Sommers-Flanagan. I am a professor in the Department of Counselor Education at the University of Montana. I'm also the author of a textbook in its fifth edition titled "Clinical Interviewing." And it's my pleasure and honor to be here for the Great Teachers Great Courses project. Thank you. And are you guys ready? Alright. So, once upon a time when I was in graduate school, I went to the University of Montana and we had to walk five miles uphill in the snow to make it to our courses. And interestingly enough, it was also five miles back and it was uphill on the way back. It snowed a lot in Montana. But this is just a way for me to introduce you to my first clinical interviewing class, and I remember it was the fall of 1981. We had this incredibly intuitive instructor. And he sent us out to do eight full 50 minute interviews and to record them. But he didn't assign us, he didn't give us anyone to talk with. We didn't have introductory volunteers, introductory psychology volunteers or anyone. We just had to go out on campus and find someone we didn't know, with our audio recorder, and do these eight interviews. And what was really fascinating was six of the eight had to be completely non-directive, no questions, no advice, nothing that could be considered directive, no interpretations, no confrontation, just listening. And I have to say that this was one of my first inspirations. I loved the class. I loved the experience. And it really helped me, I think, value the experience of doing the clinical interview, which is probably one of the reasons I ended up writing a textbook and pursuing this area as one of my main areas of study. The clinical interview goes by many names. Some people call it the intake interview or the initial interview. Physiatrists tend to call it the psychiatric interview. Social workers might call it the psychosocial history. And so there are a variety of different things that we refer to it as, but in one form or another, the clinical interview is the headwaters from which all mental health interventions flow. We need a beginning, and that initial interview or the clinical interview is that beginning. Now today's goal is for us to identify and describe the range of interviewing techniques or skills or responses that occur within the context of a clinical interview. Now even as I say that, even though it's techniques or skills or responses, I'm aware as I say that that Carl Rogers would vehemently disagree with this. Because he would say it's about attitude, about the attitudes and the experiences of the interviewer just as much as it is about techniques or skills or responses. In fact, he would not like that terminology. And so we'll try to expand our look at these kinds of techniques, skills or responses and include attitude. So, what is the clinical interview? I have up here a parsimonious definition, and it's one that I like because it's written by one of my favorite authors, which is, it's alright, that's supposed to be funny, it's written… it's written by me. Umm… And so I have defined it here as an interpersonal process designed to simultaneously initiate a therapeutic relationship and gather assessment information. Okay. So you see there are two dimensions there. We want to gather assessment information, but at the same time, we're working on that initial therapeutic relationship. Now if we look at it visually, and I've made a little graph here, we can break it into more than just two dimensions. You can see in the middle we have an interpersonal process. It's you and me talking together interpersonally, it's an exchange. On the top, I have therapeutic relationship. And in addition to therapeutic relationship, as that's forming, we're also trying to gather information, observe and assess the client or the student, whomever we're working with. In addition, as we collect that assessment information, and sometimes this happens very rapidly, we are gonna start to develop a case formulation or a more detailed treatment plan. And so in the end, and sometimes this happens actually at the beginning of the clinical interview, we focus on interventions or helping or a referral, right. Because at that end of that 50 minute hour, we would like to know what direction we're going. And so that's one way to think about and look at the clinical interview. But today what I really want to focus on is what happens. What happens in that interpersonal exchange that goes on between therapist, counselor, psychotherapist and client? And so to be more specific, I have this particular table. Now I want to warn you that there's a lot in this table, but in addition, it's very oversimplified. Because as you guys know, as people who have worked with individuals in counseling or are looking forward to working with people in counseling, there's so much that happens. And so this is just one way to look at it. And it's a way that I have found useful and I think many people find useful in understanding what you are doing in the room as a therapist or counselor. You will see here on the left, on the far left, and I… I refer to this as the listening continuum because I like to think of it as from left to right. And on the left, you might use a political analogy and say, "Well, this is where those left leaning, bleeding heart liberals spend a lot of time with lots of non-directive listening." It's like I want to know, I want you to tell me what's going on, and I don't do much directing, I just listen. And over in the far right, we have things like psycho-education or explanation, but also advice giving. And so you'll see that on the right, it's much more active and directive. If you think about it, what we're doing here on the left is we're mutually exploring with a client what's happening, what the problem might be. On the right, we're focusing on action. Here is what you should be doing. I have some ideas. Let me see if I can teach you something about how to deal better with your problem. And here in the middle, it's a little bit more focused on what we call insight. So, exploration, insight and action are these dimensions that we're looking at, along that whole listening continuum. And we're gonna go through each of these different techniques or responses in just a moment. If we hangout on the far left, then what we're doing is mostly non-directive, or sometimes I refer to this as less directive listening responses. Because of course as we all know there's nothing that's non-directive. Even as I look at it you or you look at me, there are things that we pay more or less attention to. And so it's impossible to be completely non-directive, but these are mostly non-directive responses and it starts with silence. And of course, you guys know silence can be used in really profound ways in counseling. Now here's one of the tricky things. I had an old professor who was very psychoanalytic and he would start every session, even the first session, just kind of looking expectantly at the client. And this was terrifying. It was a terrible way to start, because if you're going to use silence, silence is best used if it is accompanied by psycho-education. So, I might say, my approach is psychoanalytic and so I would be sometimes very silent waiting for you to say the next thing that comes into your mind. Because we find from this approach that it's important for it to just bubble out of you, for it to be something that naturally comes out of you. And I want to hear your next uncensored thought. So, if you explain that, and you can see that's a… a… a right column or right end of the continuum, explanation or psycho-education, but we use that in combination with silence so that our silence does not make our clients uncomfortable. And it certainly can make the clients uncomfortable if you just sit and stare at the client expectantly. Now encouragers, also called minimal encouragers by Alan Ivey years ago, way back in the '70s, that really involves a nod… head nods, right mm-hmm. And I'm saying, "Mm-hmm." I'm nodding my head. I maybe giving the right about of eye-contact for whatever cultural situation I might be in. In addition, it might involve that "Mm-hmm" and maybe body posture. We know there are certain kinds of discouragers. If I put my hands behind my head and I look over your head, that's sort of a talking discourager. You're less likely to talk. And so as we look at the clinical interviewing, the basic skills that go into it, we have to be aware that we can encourage talk and we can discourage talk. Now paraphrase is something we can talk about for… we can talk about for our whole 15 hour class, okay. We could just spend all our time on paraphrases, because there are many different dimensions of paraphrasing. A paraphrasing can include metaphors, right. It seems like… It feels like… It seems like you're spinning your wheels, that's what it feels like to you right now in your life. And we're not making much progress, right. So, I'm using a metaphor. We can use a sensory-based paraphrase and I can say, "Well, you know, as we talk, it seems like what you are saying is you're looking at yourself in the mirror and that that is umm… that's… that's enlightening for you to do that." And so I'm using the look and the "see yourself in the mirror", sensory dimension. Umm… So, there's is lots of ways to use paraphrases and it's a very important skill to have all the nuances… to have learned all those nuance about paraphrasing. Reflection of feeling is exactly what it says, and it means that I say what I see. If you are crying, I might just say, "It looks like you feel sad, okay." I don't go any further than that. I just say what I hear. I say what I see. If there's anger in your voice, maybe just a little bit, I might say, "It seems like you're a little bit annoyed or irritated about that." And so it's a way for me to reflect and be in touch with the feelings that are very clear in the room. Clarification is just when I say something like, "I'm not sure. It seems like you are angry, but I also notice some sadness, and I'm not sure which one it is." And so I'm really just kind of clarifying, asking a clarification question. "I'm not sure you've talked about staying and leaving your romantic partner." "I'm… I'm not sure which one you are leaning toward more." And so I'm just asking a clarification question based on things that you've said as a client. At last, summarization. Summarization, I have here the… the non-directive magic listening skills. And one of the things that I love about non-directive listening is it can just be, sort of, magical. I remember doing a demonstration years ago for a class and that was gonna be in all non-directive demonstration. And I… I think I did the silence and the encouragers and the paraphrases, the reflection of feeling, clarification, it was all going really well. But I… I felt like I needed to do a bigger summery. In summaries, when you take maybe 10, 15 minutes of information, maybe a whole session, and you start to summarize some of what was said. And I remember there was a young woman, and we're being videoed and I'd never met her before and it wasn't really for counseling, but as a part of this demonstration, I stumbled through a super awkward summary. I did it very badly. And the response to me was just, kind of, shocking. She then disclosed for the first time with me that she had been sexually abused. And it was to me surprising because I thought, I didn't think that was a very good summary. I was really, sort of, stumbling and trying my best. But one of the things about all these non-directive, sort of, you know, big hearted, left leaning sorts of responses, is I feel like the attitude really shows through. And if you're really trying to listen well, even if you get some things wrong, even if you stumble through some things, it's like the other person knows that you're genuinely trying to listen well. And to me, that has produced overtime many, kind of, magical and surprising responses from clients. One of the quick story about non-directive listening. Sometimes as you guys know you do non-directive play with kids. And I was seeing a 10-year-old boy, and it was the first session. And I had the parents in and then we talked about goals and I had the parents go out and I said now "For the next 20 minutes", I said to this boy, "You get to be in-charge. We can do whatever you want." And he looked at me and the first words out of his mouth were, "Get out." And I'd never had it. I never had that happen before. And I looked at him and I used a paraphrase. "So you are saying you'd like me to leave?" And he says, "Get out!" And he says… I'm really still not sure what to do. So I say, "So… So you want me to leave?" "Get out now!" I say, "Okay." I get up, I go outside, I shut the door and as I shut the door, I can hear him yelling in the office. And he's yelling, "Get back in here." So, I open the door, I lean in, I say, "So you want me to come back?" He says, "Get in here now!" I get in there, he tells me, "Sit down." I sit down. And as soon as I sit down, he looks at me again he goes, "Get out." He spent 10 of his 20 free play minutes just telling me to get out and get in, just really bossing me around. Now this brings me to a little bit of a conclusion. I guess the moral of that story is umm… a lot of times when we let things be non-directive, we learn a lot. We learn a lot about the client. I think what I learned about him was, wow, he… I think he'd been exposed to quite a bit of very, let's say, domineering or authoritarian parenting. He'd been bossed around a lot. And a lot of times, kids will just act that out and let you see what they are trying to master. So, the moral of the story with this non-directive magical listening is that we learn a lot. Now one of the problems with it is oftentimes we're not sure how much the client learns. If we just listen, maybe the client has insights and that would be great. But maybe we need to do a little bit more than just listen. So, as the clinical interview unfolds, and we'll talk about that more in a later lecture, we will be using more than just non-directive skills. But, if this were a class that I really wanted you to learn the skills, right now, I would have you take 15 minutes at least to practice only the non-directive listening skills. And I would go around and I'd listen to you guys and I'd have this little tiny electrical shock machine. No, I wouldn't really. But, I would want you to have it in your head, so that if you felt yourself do a self-disclosure, or you felt yourself maybe ask a question, you would say, "Oh, wait, I want to get back here to the left hand side", because my goal in this lecture and in lots of the clinical interviewing work that I do, is I want you to be intentional. I want you to do want you do for a purpose and to be aware of it, rather than, as an old professor of mine used to say, she used to say, "Don't fly by the seat of your pants." It's a kind of a funny image. But, actually sounds fun, but we shouldn't do that as we're doing clinical interviews or doing counseling. Now here's the middle of the road column. We're gonna go through these pretty quickly. But, as we look at the top, and imagine the top being the left hand side of this continuum, we have feeling validation, and that's different than reflection of feeling and you might have a really good sense for that already, but I know a lot of times people don't. But, if I say to someone, "It seems… seems like you're angry and, you know, I really can't blame you." That's different than a feeling reflection, because I am as an expert saying, "I can't blame you. It seems natural. It seems "I'm universalizing it, I'm validating it," and that is a big difference between a reflection of feeling. Reflections of feelings tend to let people explore. If I validate your feeling, I say, "You're angry, and darn it, I think anybody in your situation would be." Well, that might reduce your need to explore your anger, your reaction, okay. So, that's feeling validation. If we move across this continuum and down the list, interpretive reflection of feeling has been referred to as advanced empathy by a guy named Gerard Egan, who has written a lot about the interview and interviewing skills. Interpretive reflection of feeling is when I go below what I just see, into something else that might be there. So, I might say, "You know, I… I hear you saying that you're really, really angry with your father, okay. And yet it also seems like underneath that anger, there's just also a whole lot of disappointment." And I want to try that, not just get to the anger, but to get to some other emotions that might be underlying the anger. And that can be true. If someone is very sad, they might also feel at the same time resentful, and so I might be able to help the person by having this interpretive reflection of feeling or advanced empathy to have a deeper or broader experience of their emotional life. That would be a good thing. Think about these directive listening skills again as facilitating insight. I want the person to know or learn a little bit more about himself or herself. Interpretation, you know, we think of the old classic interpretation. Maybe you come into me and you say, "This one professor is just getting to me, just driving me crazy. I just hate him and the things that he says." And after a while, once we've got some time together and maybe you've told me some other things about your life, maybe your history, I might say, "You know, it seems like the reaction you are having to your professor is related not only to the fact that he's doing things that are annoying, but also to the fact that it seems to repeat some of the kinds of relationship dynamics you had with your father." So you can see that's the psychoanalytic. I want to tie the present to the past and help to enhance your understanding of what's going on in your life, in that class with that professor on the basis of that insight. There's also another kind of interpretation that… that people have used, kind of a more modern type, we call it reframing. And that might just be that it seems like the one of the reasons that you feel so angry at your professor is that he just… what he says is really important to you. So, I'm… I'm reframing it. A lot of times with teenagers, you know, if they're kind of annoying each other or being annoyed by each other, you might say, "It seems like you kind of like each other." So that's a reframe, a reinterpretation of the reality that the person's experiencing. Confrontation is interesting. You know the old fashion confrontation. "You're gonna have to stop yourself from drinking, 'cause you know you're gonna end up dead and in the gutter if you don't." And, you know, "What do you think you're doing?" And so that can be very aggressive confrontation, but the way we talk about it in a clinical interview it's just pointing out discrepancies. On the one hand this, on the other hand that. Let's say I'm working with you and you're in a romantic relationship, and it's a good one, and you're saying some good things about it, but then you also are talking about some of your struggles with gambling. And I might say, "On the one hand, I hear you really valuing this romantic relationship that you're in, but on the other hand, I hear that you're continuing to gamble and you recognize that this might have a negative affect on your relationship." I'm just bringing those two things together and just… and then I… I… I'd say those two things together, then I try to get from you your reaction to it. And people can go either way. Sometimes they will get really defensive and say, "Well, you know, I feel like I shouldn't have to change for him, or her." Or you might say, "Yeah, I got to do something." And so confrontation can produce insight and can move people towards some change. Immediacy, I'm sitting in the room and I do, kind of, an immediate self-disclosure. I might be, you know, sensing some sadness from you and so I might just say, "You know, as I am in the room with you, I notice I start to feel sad myself." Okay. And I share that. It's a little bit of a self-disclosure in the moment. It's not about my life. I'm not… And then I will start talking about, "Well, and I'm sad also because that professor reminds me of my father", yeah. So, I don't want to go too far into my own issues, but I want to resonate with what might be happening and given immediacy response. And now you'll notice the last thing on that list is summarization, and it shouldn't be. And I… I'd like to say that I planned to have the wrong word there, because it's good to show that, you know, you're fallible and you make lots of mistakes. And so the word that should be there is uh… open questions, because open questions, kind of, turn the corner from directive listening skills to action skills and open question, as you guys know, might be… and Studs Terkel said this really well, he was a journalist. You got people to talk openly about things. And he said the best question is the most gentle question, and it's often, "And what happened next?" And so open questions are what questions, how questions, how does it feel when you talk about this? How does it feel when you imagine yourself confronting or talking with your romantic partner, about whatever the issue is? So, again, if we're in class, you guys would be just practicing away for the next five hours. I'd have you practicing those skills. And now we're getting to the right side of the continuum. I'm gonna go over these quickly. These are very directive. I usually say to people, don't do these until you got that solid relationship and you've done some non-directive listening, with the exception of psycho-education, which obviously you need to do and you need to do well. And you need to be clear about what you're working on with someone. So that blends really well with the first two columns, but questions, questions don't come up here until you're on the right side of the continuum, because they are very directive, they are about me. If I say to you, "Where are you from?" It's because I want to know. It's not because you necessarily want to tell me, right? And so questions are super directive. They are also incredibly effective. One kind of question I love the most is the projective question. And so I'm gonna pose that to you guys right now and that is, "What if you were to do really well on a test?" Or maybe you were… you received the prize or the accommodation or the commendation in your class for the best performance? Who would you tell first? That's a projective question, because I'm asking you to put yourself into the future and to explore a possibility. It's a really powerful kind of question. I might also say, "And why would you pick that person?" And of course oftentimes people say, "Don't ask why questions", and I totally agree. Most of the times, don't ask why questions unless you have a good reason to ask a why question, in which case it's a good question. Other things, suggestion, I might say, I might just suggest that sometime in the next week, you could have a dream. Sometime in the next week, you might notice some of the strengths that you have in your personality, some of abilities that you have. Agreements should mostly be avoided, because if I agree with you, I can also disagree, it tends to be a dangerous thing. Giving advice, as we know, we get lots of advice in life. Good counselors, good clinical interviewers use advice sparingly, because they know a lot of people get a lot of advice and so you want to wait till the right moment to give it. Urging, I might actually urge someone to maybe get out of a difficult relationship. I might urge someone to practice some mindfulness meditation. I might push someone to get involved in a DBT group. Okay, so those are some things that, you know, you might urge someone to do because you really think it's the best thing. If we were in a class, you guys will be practicing the heck out of these directive things. Some concluding comments. The clinical interview is really all about different combinations of the therapeutic relationship, assessment, case formulation and interventions or referral. Now I've turned that into an ac… acronym. Therapeutic relationship is TR, TR-A-C-I. So, if there's anyone named Tracy, I've named this after you. The… The range of these responses that can happen within the clinical interview is overwhelming, especially in the beginning. So now to close, I would just like to say, I have a homework assignment for you. And the homework assignment is between now and your next meeting. Next time we meet for class, I want you to go out and do at least a 30-minute non-directive interview where you stay on the left hand side of that continuum. And I want you to see what that feels like, and then I think it will help you be more intentional and more aware of the kinds of ways that you're interacting with people during clinical interviews. So, thanks very much for listening. I appreciate your openness to learning today.
