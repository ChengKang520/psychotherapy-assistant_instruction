DAPHNA OYSERMAN So, you, you heard the, the topic of the talk and, uhm, why don't we proceed to the first slide. Uhm, the work that I've been doing, actually really since my, ah, graduate career has been asking the question, uhm, what is self-concept do? A lot of research and discussion about self-concept talks about what it is, uhm, and talk about quantitive self-concept, uhm, self-concept as a, as a, as evaluative, uhm, do we'd like ourselves, we do not like ourselves. Uhm, but the part of self-concept that I was truly the most interested in is the link between how we think about ourselves and the extent to which we actually do the things that we say we wanna do, that we actually are able to work toward our goals. Uhm, I, and, the, and therefore, the focus of my work, for uhm, many years has been on, ah, what have been called "possible selves". In other words, that aspect of self-concept that is the self that's imagined in the near and maybe also more distal future. Uhm, the self-relevant goals that we have or we're expecting to be like what we're afraid we might be like. And these, rather than calling them, uhm, uhm, values or ah, goals. I wanna talk about them really as very vivid images and those are the, the selves that I'm talking about or the images we have of ourselves getting to those valued endpoints. So it's that clever self who passed Algebra and is doing fine, uhm, on the positive side. And on the negative side, it's that off-track self who wasn't careful, got pregnant, got a bad reputation and so forth. And the, the theory at least is that by making the future come alive, by giving us that tactile feel, by giving us that vivid image, possible selves can impell current action. But of course in our personal lives and in ah, the lives of, of students that we work with, we know that just because you want it doesn't necessarily make it so. And it is the case that kids do end up, uhm, in end says they didn't want. So they end up failing Algebra, engaging in risky behaviors. And so my research that I'll be talking about today is really, uhm, ask two very basic questions. What makes it so hard to do the things that we say we wanna do to engage in that sustained self-regulatory behavior, first, and second because all of the searches that are engaging not just chatting about social justice issues, what can we do about it? Uhm, and I'm gonna focus exclusively on school and school achievement for a couple of reasons. First, kids really are worried about doing well in school. They really do wanna do well in school. Uhm, and second is, uhm, graduating high school as a first goal is an attainable goal. It's just not the case that it's in America, it's that hard to graduate high school, which makes it particularly perplexing why not everyone does. Okay. So, it's a goal that kids say they wanna do. It's a goal that ought to be attainable. It's a goal that plenty of kids do not attain. And also, it's a goal that is quite critical, because if you don't graduate high school, all sorts of other things that are good are less likely for you. And also to things that are problematic including mental health outcomes, unemployment, problems with parenting afterwards because of the stress of poverty and so forth. All sorts of negative things cascade from that. So it's really quite important, even if we're not in exclusive education, all of us really should be thinking about it. Uhm, and, and I'm giving some numbers that, that came out of, of Harvard or Field's ah, group. Uhm, they are looking at high school graduation nationally at 75% so we think it's universal but it's not, and particularly lower in, in ah, some of the targeted groups that they were looking at, African-American, Hispanics, uhm, but clearly in urban areas the numbers are a lot lower so ah, the local Detroit estimates are about 40 to 44% on time of graduation. So, what's going on? Why aren't possible selves sort of doing their job? Well, as I thought about it, it seemed to me that possible selves should improve self-regulation. Uhm, but that it's not always that easy because possible selves aren't always cued by the environment. So if it's hard to think of your possible self, your possible self is less likely to influence you. Uhm, and so that's actually one of the things I wanted to understand, why is it that it's not always easy to think about your possible self. So I came up with at least three sources of difficulty for the kids I was interested in kids who are living in Detroit so they, through this combination of low income and minority status. Uhm, public schools in Detroit are about 93% African-American. So since we here the, here the, here are the possibilities for difficulty. First, it may be difficult to bring to mind, school-focused possible selves and link them with strategies for doing it. It may be difficult to sustain over time the motivation to keep engaging in those strategies coz after all, doing well in school doesn't entail doing your homework once, or staying after school once, or doing your homework once. It means doing it day after day after day, which is the long slogan. Maybe that's the part that's hard. And the third part that I think we should think about so, you know, do the other's possible selves cued or they linked with strategies? Do you, can you keep doing those strategies over time and thirdly, does it feel congruent to you? I wanna do well in school. My parents expect me to do well in school but do we do school? So is school linked with social identities and in this case in particular, racial ethnic identities. Well, probably the answer to that is, well, self-concept is not so simple. Anyone who studied self-concept for more than, you know, a paragraph's worth of reading aboutn it is immediately struck by the fact that there's lots of ways to define yourself and those ways of defining yourself are not necessarily congruent. And these different parts of self more than simply, you know, the nicest thing is they're not necessarily congruent. They may be literally pull you in different directions. Uhm, and William James talked about this in 1890. The first, excuse me, I seem to be stuck on the tape here. Ah, the first ah, psychologist when psychology was, was decoupling from philosophy was already talking about these issues. And he said, you know, I mean if it were possible, we would have all possible goals but it's not possible because your social self, uhm, wants to go out and have fun and your school self, your scholar self needs to stay home and study. So we can't do all things. So now we do, we need to define what it is we would like to become. We also need in some ways to prioritize. There needs to be something that's more salient, more central, cued more often by the context than other things. Okay. So that's one thing. And the other thing is in adolescence during the time that kids need to be staying on track in school, that's a particularly difficult time because that's the time when kids are very sensitive not only to identity questions, "Who am I? How do I fit in?", but also that interface between personal and social selves, what kinds of things do we do, uhm, how do we engage the world. So the question is of all these possible selves, of all these ways of defining your selves, of all these possibilities for how your group might define, which are the ones that you should really engage long-term effort in? Which are the ones that you should sustain self regulation in? And my sense was that as you're going through life, some selves feel more true, more core, more real and genuine, and which are the ones that sort of feel right? Well, the ones that feel right are the ones that don't seem to be in conflict with other selves. Uhm, the ones that seem to, to flow, so you get us an experience of genuineness as you do them, and the ones that you know how to engage, you have strategies for. Problem for school is that, doing well in school, anyone who's been studying for finals or writing papers recently doesn't always feel good. You don't always have a sense of flow as you're doing school. In fact, you often have a sense of, or, okay. So there you are, you're trying to do school and if you're using that rule of thumb, that heuristic that if it feels good, it's me, then school is not gonna feel like you. So one of the key things we have to think about when we're thinking inventions is how do we decouple the sort of automatic heuristic "feels right is genuine" and reframe that so that difficulties that are experienced on route are experienced as normative. Doing well in school is hard. If it's hard that, and I'm working on it, it must mean that it's really me, I must really care about it 'cause I keep doing it. Okay. So on the one hand, as I said before, school-focused possible selves are common. We did ah, a broad survey across as, a number of states, across African-American, white, Latino kids who are moderate to low income, and school-focused possible selves are the most common thing. So almost all kids mentioned that at least once, either as a feared self that they won't do well or as an expected self that they want to do well. So it's really common. There's something to scaffold off of it if we wanna do some sort of an intervention on the one hand. On the other hand, very few kids, about 30% in that sample, had detailed, concrete, possible selves related to school, linked to strategies. So few kids actually have those visions in, that are articulated in ways that can actually do something. Many kids have some image. Why might that be? Why might there be lots who sort of, you know, have the sense that they wanna do it but few who actually have it in some detailed way? Well, we're looking at context and on changes on social psychologists so my immediate thought is well, what's in the context? What is the interplay between the personality, the individual self, and the social context? Well, okay, what do we see? Well, low, low income social context may very well be unlikely to automatically cue strategies to attain school-focused possible selves. And there's been a lot of discussion, most of it qualitative and ethnographic, arguing that they're likely to increase the likelihood that school-focused possible selves are perceived as incongruent, the rest of self because if you look at your in-group and your in-group isn't doing school, this may send a meta message whether you're getting that exclusive message or not that may be it's not a nice thing to do. Uhm, and therefore, makes it more difficult to grapple with the fact that it feels hard because the other mes, the other thing that we learn when things feel hard is that maybe it's not realistic. So all the little girls who are gonna be ballerinas and the boys who are gonna be, you know, star athletes at some point, they give up on those things because they don't feel realistic. And the question is for school, how many kids think, oh, this isn't a realistic goal for me and give up on it when that's inappropriate because in that case, difficulty can be something that you can work with. Okay. So in order to sustain action, those possible selves have to cue strategies. Research, resource rich context are likely to help kids make those cues. So everybody in your context is gonna get you back on board. They're gonna serve as models, yeah, I had trouble with Geometry too but you get through it, and then it's easier. Yes, Physics is hard but you can do it. I did it. You need a tutor? I'll give it to you. Okay. That's sort of the, the definition of a middle class or resource-rich context. And what happens in resource-poor context is not that people are necessarily of ill will. They're just simply is less to go around. So it's harder for kids to get help. It's less automatic and kids need in that sense to be having those strategies on their own, to know to go and look for the resources rather than assume that the resources will simply be there. Okay. So this is a little reiteration and, uhm, ah, a nice qualitative description of these issues comes in a Roderick's recent review, uhm, and basically the same kinds of issues that I talked about. He gave some qualitative descriptions of low SES context are less likely to provide models or cue strategies to change school-focused possible selves. Why? Well, what is the, what is the low SES context? There's lots of adult unemployment or underemployment. There are lots of adults, potentially of low academic attainment, uhm, less ability for the community to be an effective monitor of, of kids, uhm, which means that kids may end up with, as Roderick was calling it an abstract commitment to education. So it's not that they're saying they don't value it. They do value it but they don't make that connection in everyday behavior. So kids, he says, may express high aspirations but behavior doesn't necessarily reflect it. It reflects he said, avoiding or just getting out of the situation, cutting class because it's uncomfortable to be there.

00:14:05
DAPHNA OYSERMAN Okay. So clearly what we need to do is to integrate racial, I think, identities, social identities, social class identities and possible selves because if all these kids are running around thinking that they personally would want to do well in school but feeling unsure whether kids like them, can or do, do those things. Then there needs to be some sort of ah, a linking going on. Uhm, and as, uhm, a number of people, and I'm citing a bunch of people uhm, have, have talked about these issue that when you're, when you're not ah, a mainstream, uhm, middle class kind of a kid, but you are low income or you're uhm, African-American or Latino, you're more likely to get images out there, sort of in the air of, of uhm, negative outcomes. And Cowell(ph) did an ethnography in high schools and she asked kids, you know, what's gonna be with these different groups of kids, and there's a consensus among the kids. They saw these Latino kids I've been, they'll be laborers, the African-American kids, oh, they won't do well in school. So it's out there among your peers, uhm, Centrogram(ph) did, uhm, some experiments. She had kids uhm, listen to stories about kids and when the kid was failing, Latino and African-American students predicted that the, that the student was Latino or African-American, not white. When the kid was doing well in school, these same students said, oh, this kid is probably white. So Cowell's(ph) study is saying, you know, what do people say about your group. Gram's(ph) study is saying why do people in your group lost it again. Why do, why do people in your group, uhm, say about, about your group uhm, and another very interesting, uhm, studies with somewhat younger kids even, they gave kids uhm, pictures and, you know, kid's standing next to a house and they said, uhm, is this kid gonna do well or not, and low income low SES kids are more likely to say that, that kid standing next to that, you know, low income apartment complex, he's not gonna do well, he's not gonna attain his, uhm, goals. And that kid standing next to that nice brick house, that kid will do well, will attain his goals. Did you go to the next slide already? Okay. Then that worked okay. Uhm, uhm, so what we would wanna do then given the fact that kids from, the, these studies have been done (inaudible [00:16:18.575]) on. So given the fact that it seems to be, it's in the air, they sort of sense that kids like us may not do well in school. Uhm, the fact that if you're in a heterogeneous context, other kids will be having those uhm, negative assumptions as well, that it's important to figure out some way of doing an intervention that would increase the felt congruence between school-focused possible selves and, uhm, social identities. And for, for the reasons that I said because on the one hand, there was negative pre-formed images are out there. And on the other hand, uhm, those accessible images of in-group members engaging in, in undermining behaviors makes it harder for you to think about doing the things that would actually be promotive. Okay. Next slide. Uhm, so so far I've talked about the fact that you wanna have those possible selves. Low income context are unlikely to cue them. It's important for those possible selves to be connected to social identities but that too may not be automatic in low income context. And the third thing that I mentioned which is this idea of, uhm, the experience of difficulty. And so, an intervention would wanna do those first two things, getting those possible selves linked to strategies, getting those possible selves to feel congruent with, with ah, social identities but also to do what I've been calling, uhm, inoculating from over-interpretation of difficulty. So difficulty should not mean, "Oh, this is not me. I should withdraw. I shouldn't do it." Difficulty should be felt as, oh, this is how school is. You have to keep working at it and everybody sweats and, and has to do it. And so, what I thought is it's true that school is difficult for everybody. But it's also probably true that low-income kids are more likely to misinterpret difficulty because they would be less likely to have people who are models of saying that they turned difficulty into success. Okay. And more likely they have people who might commiserate with them which is not the same as helping inoculate. Commiserate is saying, "Yes, school was a misery for me too and I didn't do well." Okay. Inoculating is saying, yeah, it's, it's, it's a bear. It's horrible, but you get through it and then you know stuff. Okay. So that's also something that we wanna make sure that we do because that mis, that misinterpretation is crucial for withdrawing effort. Okay. So school ah, low SES kids are likely to need specific inoculation from over-interpretation of, of current difficulty and failure uhm, and success of movement toward positive school-focused possible selves and away from feared school-focused possible selves required on, requires ongoing behavior coz it's not enough to just do it once. So what we want is an intervention that gets kids going and keeps them going. It can't be something that is so expensive and resource-intensive that you can't do it for lots of kids, but it has to be something that is some sort of ah, you know, an engine that keeps on going because the, the process has to keep on going. It's not getting over one particular difficult time. It's, it's continuing through. Uhm, and so what we don't want is for kids to say if working on a possible self is difficult then this difficulty means that it's not for me or it's not true for me then I'll quit. We want kids to say, working on this possible self is difficult and not's just the way it is in difficulty and engaging difficulty means I care. Okay. Next. Can, can people hear me now? 

00:19:40
  Yes. 

00:19:45
DAPHNA OYSERMAN Uhr. It's better? But am I making, no? Now, I'm okay? Okay. All right. Are we on the different slide? Can we be on one? Turn this one off. No. Okay. So I got funded by NIMH to do those things. Okay. So what I wanted to do was to help kids, make it easier for kids to bring to my school focused possible selves and strategies, provide a coherent link between the school-focused possible selves and social identities, and provide alternative interpretations and if you've been wondering what crazy world I'm living on where there's a tune of possibles uhm, interpretations exist, you know, it's sports. I have three kids and I was dragged kicking and screaming into soccer and other sporting events in which clumsy, two left-legs kids are told to keep on trying. And I kept saying, "We're not riding the bus to the museum, why are we spending all these effort on school?" Oh no, not school, sports. "Oh." And when kids, what do we do with kids in school, we just track 'em. What do we do with sports especially with little kids, everybody plays. Okay. So it seemed to me that oddly enough, in, it's not that I'm going to a different culture or a different world and time and space, coexisting at the same time in America are all of these ways of, of discourse that are very helpful to get kids engage in sports and we're not using them to get kids engage in school. Okay. So all these things, you know, you miss a hundred percent of the shots you don't take, uhm, the a inspiration-perspiration, of course, is snuck in as a supposed quote from Einstein but we'll pretend it's a sports thing. It sounds sweaty and sports-like, uhm, and uhm, you know, the important things in life are the ones you really have to work for. There's a lot of that right direct within sports and that's what we wanted kids to get within school. Okay. So we wanna influence possible selves, moderate the relationship between possible selves and social identity, and moderate the experience of difficulty in asserting a possible self. And I'll show you, in the next slide, the picture. Uhm, so here's our process model and then press again, please the next slide. Okay. Uhm, so STJ, School to Jobs, is the name we call our intervention. We said the intervention should have a direct effect of possible selves as the first year(ph). That possible selves should influence self-regulatory behavior in that effort and then if you try, if you keep on trying, you will get better grades and you probably also will feel better. You won't be depressed 'coz not doing well in school should be depressing 'coz all the kids remember say they want to do well in school. Okay. But we said it's not just the blue path, we also wanna take care of other things. Why? Well, whoop! Back up please. Sorry. Yes. Social identity. So racial identity we say influences possible selves and that thing down there, the meta cognitive experience, that's feeling if it's hard, it's not genuine. Okay. That's the way that you deal with the feeling that you get while thinking about something. And what we said is we want the intervention to moderate those relationships so it typically may be that there's no relationship between social identity and possible selves or maybe even a negative relationship, we want it to be positive. We want the intervention to change the nature of that relationship. The same thing for meta-cognitive experience typical belief. It feels hard, you let go of that possible selves, we don't want that to happen anymore. We wanna change the nature of that relationship. So that's why those are moderating areas. Okay. Next slide. Okay. So we're going to do the intervention in school because if you wanna change something, you have to change it in its natural context. Right. Uhm, we wanted the intervention to make school-focused possible selves salient. And we wanted the activities to ah, inoculate kids from withdrawing efforts so they would keep working on attaining their positive, positive possible selves and avoiding their school, their, ah, feared school-focused possible selves. 

00:23:45
[sil.] 

00:23:45
DAPHNA OYSERMAN  And in the long term, what we hoped is that changing those possible selves would actually ah, get kids to keep working so they would spend more time on homework, they would behave well while sitting in class, which doesn't mean sitting there quietly. It means asking questions, uhm, staying after class if you need, participating. So that's the positive stuff, and it also means not the negative stuff because you would have to be a real genius to know the material while you're standing in the hall 'cause you've been thrown out for throwing spitballs. Okay. So we want kids to engage positively, not do the kind of destructive things that gets them thrown out 'cause that's not gonna help. The other thing we thought would be important again on, on, on the uhm, sort of ah, Woody Allen school of, of life which is show up, okay, and we would want kids to show up. We don't want kids to skip school. So the other thing that we would thought(ph) self- regulation would entail is actually showing up. So we want you to show up, behave while you're there, and do your homework at home. Okay. Those are the self-regulation things and we think that if you do those things, school is not that hard. You'll be able to pass and you'll feel pretty good. So those are the, the longer term outcomes. Uhm, I'm gonna walk very quickly through the actual sessions because, otherwise it all sounds very uhm, sort of esoteric, but yes, yes, yes, but what did you do. So let me just uhm, describe the sessions and I'll describe to you the, the randomized clinical trials. So first you get a feel for what it is and then I'll tell you how we did it. Okay. I want you to do something brief. I want you to do something fun. If it was hard, you wouldn't engage in it, and then we would be stuck from the beginning. Okay? So in the first session, we really want you to focus on making those school foc, focused possible selves feel relevant uhm, to their social identities. So uhm, we ah, got kids together. We, we play the game with marbles and they uhm, were paired up and they had to introduce their partner to the group in terms of the skills and abilities that partner had to do well in school and to make it to the 9th Grade, and make it to high school. And, you know, it's, that's, that's a different way of introducing, then typical ways of introducing, so kids needed a little practice. And then we sat in a circle, and uhm, we had kids repeats the names of the kids who have been introduced and all things they remembering about their skills or abilities. So if you think about this as a social context, you're sitting in a room with a bunch of other kids who you're getting to know in terms of a positive school relevant thing about them. Every single kid in the room has some positive school relevant thing about them. Okay. That's sort of it. That's, that's it. That's Session 1. That's enough. In Session 2, uhm, we focused on making a link to adult images. So kids came in the room and the room was filled with these nice laminated shots of adults doing things. And they were balanced, male and female, uhm, and balanced proportionate to the kids that we had. So our kids were African-American, Latino, and White. Uhm, and we had kids pick, pictures of, of adults that look like the adults they wanted to become. Uhm, we didn't tell them but they were picture of adults with jobs, adults with families, adults with hobbies, and some negative images of adults with, you know, who are in jail, adults who had died and so forth. And kids picked stuff. They pick things and then at the end, we had them describe, we know what, what they were thinking about, and mostly people picked, it's America, so mostly people picked stuff. Right. They're gonna have houses, and cars, and boats. Uhm, and at the end, the trainor, just sort of says, "Oh, okay. So how, how, do adults get this stuff?" Oh? Somebody invariably will say, "They, they have jobs." Okay, done. Okay, so you want stuff. You need a job. Okay, fine. Then we go on to the next session, uhm, where we look at role models, both negative and positive, and they draw, and you can see each session in some other tactile thing. You're doing something. You're not sitting around and chatting, which is boring and embarrassing. So you're doing things. Uhm, and everybody, you know, picked, drew, drew pictures and everybody in the end has both positive role models and negative forces in their lives. The idea that we wanna deal with this sort of idea of inoculation for failure is that negative things are there. They're present for everybody. Everyone has to deal with them. Next Session, 4? Uhm, timelines. So now we're not, we're doing something different to get this big, nice, long piece of paper that covers your desk and sort of narrow, so cut poster board. So there is your life, you start now and as far out as you can go, but unlike a timeline of history where it's a single line 'coz supposedly there's only one story, and we know what it was. Here, you have to have forks in the road because things made you make it depending on what your plan. These things may change. It may go one way or you choose something else, you may go another. But also, we called it obstacles, so breaks in the road, 'coz things may not go the way you planned and you have to draw at least one of those two and talked about how you get around it. So the idea is, you know, we're moving closer and closer toward things you do now, matter for the future, but also that things may be difficult but it's not just because you wish it, it will be there. Okay. That's, The 5th Session, next slide. Uhm, the 5th Session introduced action goals, okay, with this idea that it's not just saying I want to get from here to there. That you also have to think about how you're gonna do it. And one of the ways to think about it is to actually break it down and say, "Well, you know I'm gonna do this when?" Okay. So we had kids actually practicing those sort of, "When am I actually gonna do my homework?" Okay, because as anybody who had ever had New Year's resolutions that they have not fulfilled, it's easy to say you're gonna lose weight and, and how you're gonna do that, "Oh! I'm going to do them everyday. I'm gonna go do it for an hour everyday." And then you sit down and you try and figure out when, when during the day is that hour gonna occur, and then you realize, "Okay. Better figure out an alternate plan cause this one is not gonna work." Well kids don't necessarily do that. So they walk around thinking they're gonna do their homework, but there was never an actual time when it would happen. So at this session, we were sort of working on figuring out how would this actually happen, how are they actually gonna do these things, because by now, they're sort of more motivated to 'coz they've done the timelines and so forth. In the next two sessions, we looked at uhm, everyday problem behaviors. Oh! Sorry. That's not right. The next two sessions, we do poster boards, so a different thing, a big poster board. Uhm, the first third of it is next year, the middle is strategies, and the last third is when you're an adult. The first third, at the top, you have stickers for what you're expecting to be like. And the bottom third, what you're afraid you might be like. The stickers come from sort of years of research; we know what kids are likely to say. Plus, there are some blank ones, you can stick it in. So you start out and you have this empty poster board and you're putting in, "What am I gonna be like? What do I not wanna be like?" Fine. Then in the middle, there's another baggy. You take that baggy; it's strategies. What are you actually gonna do about it? And again, those are from things kids have set. Plus, we planted some extras. So, no, I'm not doing that. I'm not doing that. I'm not doing that. I'm not doing that. And after you've gone through and write all those things that you're not doing, often kids have a pretty blank middle. So they have all sorts of things they're expecting to be like. Also some nice positive things and things that they are wanting to avoid but they're not actually doing very much. And that's sort of a very sobering moment. There's sort of emptiness of that middle panel. So as not to leave it like that, we then, and they draw lines between the strategies and the possible selves that they relate to. So as not to leave it so empty, we then say, "Okay, go back to the baggy, take some things and put then on. That are things that now that you've read about them, you think Oh! I actually, I could do that. Put them on." And then it's a different color lines so you see what you're actually doing and what you think you might do. Then in the following week, we come back and we add an adult possible selves and we say, "What are the things you're doing now that would help you to become not only something next year but also the adult that you would like to become?" So that pathway to the future. And there's not much often. Now your parents have told you that, your teachers told you that, your pastor's told you that, but looking at it on your poster board, you have all these future goals but you're not doing anything about it. It's a very sort of powerful thing for the kids, and at that point, at, at the end, we have kids who are doing stuff that other kids say they would think they could do, actually talk about what it feels like to do those things. So that kids get some, some sense. Okay. The last sessions, we, uhm, we actually work on uhm, everyday problems. So we give them things like, you know, "You're in this math class and, and the first, the first test you got a C, and then you got a D. And now the teacher says, anybody who fails this one, that's it, they're out of this class." And we don't ask them immediately whether they should stay or go, but rather in groups. They're supposed to work on, you know, why, why would they care? What difference would it make? And then what would they wanna do about it? So that they have a chance to think about, "Well, do I need this math class? Does it actually matter? Okay. So I'm not in this math class and then I'll stop getting these bad grades. Great, right?" Or is, if, if not this math class, what is my alternative. And somebody in those groups comes up with different questions so that together the group process is much more enriched and they begin to, to be able to think about the kinds of things that of course, parent's and teachers want them to think about which is as more sort of contingent thinking, "If I do these things now, what difference they'll make for, for later on." Okay. And we do that with a bunch of different problems, so it goes over a couple of sessions, uhm, and depending on how the groups are, uhm, we also have them write their own everyday problems and pick one to, to work on as a group. Okay. So everyday problems about school. Then the last one is doing this sort of round up of linking the stuff we've talked about to the, the actual goal of the, of the interventions. So we ask them to think about uhm, high school. "So what do you need to do to graduate high school? What are the classes you need to take uhm, besides taking certain classes what else do you need, and uhm, how hard is it to do that." And the kids have to figure that out and brainstorm. And remember, this isn't the fall of the 8th Grade. And in Detroit, high schools they, fall of the 9th Grade. So the idea is to help kids who were not necessarily having parent's who are already explaining all that to them. Figure out and articulate the things because otherwise you end up behind before you even realized it. And somebody in the groups, all of them, they end up being able to figure things out, but we also give them lists to read. Uhm, Detroit is a complete school of choice city. So you can go to any school in the city and they are also testing schools. So sort of, in essence like, like New York that has testing schools. Uhm, so A, you have to know that you need to test in. B, you have to know what that means to test in. And then most of the testing, all the testing schools, if there's a test in and a throw out. Okay, so if you do not attain good grades while you're there, then out you go, they're not keeping you, which allows them to keep very high success rates but means that you need to know all that stuff. So we sort of work, work through all of those things. Uhm, Okay. Uhm, then we. we basically, school for many other kids, one of the things that we found out is that the whole thing is confusing. And we think it's of this sort of contingent things, and if you do well in English this year, you know it's different next year and, and all of these kinds of things. And for kids, it's really it's all, when the teacher made me read this and then I went there and I run(ph). So what we do for each of our sessions is, every week they need to tell us, "What did you do last week? What was that about? What did you learn?" Okay. "Now what are we doing this week?" Okay. And then at the end of that session, then next week, you say, "What did we do last week and so forth." To the very end, you want them to walk through all of the sessions and say, " What were the things that you did and what was that about?" So that they have some sort of an orderly thing in their mind about what that process was and through practicing it, then it's likely to stick, because remember it's only, uhm, it's, it's twice a week so there's only like four and a half weeks worth of stuff that we do. Okay. We do a couple of sessions with parent's or guardian. We did at the end. The reason we did it at the end is social psychologists often then go into marketing and the way that you sell cereal that parent's don't want by, is you advertise to the kids who then tell you that it's so great and they want you to buy it. So we wanted this to be so fun that we could get kids to bring their parents in. And then we could get parents involved. I see I'm on the 10-minute thing, so I'm gonna start moving more quickly. Can you, uhm, very briefly, ah, we had our, it was the, the, first round of the study was uhm, after school. The data I'm gonna be showing you is randomized clinical trial during the school day. The reason that we ah, went to randomized clinical trial during the school days it that after school, you may not be able to get everybody that we can stay after school. And this way, if it works in this context, that mean that it works because it's all kids. So we took ah, three middle schools. Uhm, they're entering cohorts. And as you can see it's predominantly African-American but much less African-American than you would expect if I said 93% of the, of the, ah, public schools in Detroit are, ah, Af, 93% of the kids in public schools in Detroit are African-American, is because we went to the southwest where there are more, ah, more diversity because I was concerned that if I run it in an all African-American context, people might think that it only works in the all African-American context or it only works for African-Americans, and I wanted to do this not only to improve the lives of these kids but to get a sense as a randomized trial. So I picked this, this ah, school. Uhm, it's an elective randomized clinical trial for 7 weeks, twice a week. Uhm, 11:45-minute class periods. It ended before Thanksgiving, before the first marking period. So you get all round up that you're gonna do school before your first set of grades. And before the teacher already knows what kind of kids you are. So if you decide you wanna be a different kid this year, you have a chance to do it. And before all the other kids have, you know, sort of pigeon-holed you. And as I mentioned, those two supplemental parent sessions. Okay. Can, let's keep going. Uhm, just in words first and then I'll show you that graphs. Uhm, absences and in-school misbehavior significantly declined compared to uhm, the ah, control youth both at the end of the first year and then I'll show you at end of 2 years. So 2 years later, at the end of 9th Grade. So they went from those 3 middle schools to, close to 80 high schools and the effects lasted. And in fact, as you'll see in all the graphs, they got bigger. Uhm, academic initiative. So standardized test-scores and grades improved compared to control, kids by school records. And effects were mediated by change in possible selves so found in the theoretical model and the intervention increased both school-focused possible selves, and I won't to get into how we had defined them uhm, with balanced and plausibility as well as increasing fear of, track possible selves that was interesting because they were not targeted. But it's a high-risk context, and so, potentially at the same time that you're thinking, "I better do this school stuff," you're thinking, " I better not get in trouble." Okay. Uhm, and so it increased both this feared off-track possible selves and strategies to avoid it so kids would say things like you know, "I told my friends that I can skip if I want to. If they want to, I'm going to class." Or, uhm, you know, "I don't wanna get pregnant so I'm, I'm reading a book and so forth." So they're using school as a way to avoid getting in trouble. Uhm, this is the, and all the graphs, let me just say, uhm, will follow the same pattern. The, the ah, the, the non-broken line uhm, is the intervention. The broken line is control. This is, and on the uhm, x-axis is gonna be months since baseline and the y axis will be the, the dependent variable. This one is hours a week of uhm, homework time. And you see it's basically flat for the intervention and significantly declining. And as you see the decline is escalating over time for the control group kids. And that's pretty much the line that you're gonna see for everything. So we might have hoped initially that what we were gonna do is improve a lot of the kids in the intervention. But what we were actually able to do is stave off the kind of rapid decay that happens to the other kids. So next slide. This is initiative in class. So again, flat line for intervention, kids dropping for the control kids. Again, dropping more as time goes on. Next slide. Uhm, risk of skipping. Skipping goes up. Everybody skips more. And what we see there, unlike the other two where it was an increasing amount of change over time. There, we, we got kids, they paid attention, they, they reduced the amount of skipping and it stayed flat. Now this one is graphed a little differently because you get the data the school can give you and not the data you want. So the data I was able to get starts at the end of the first semester. Now the intervention was done before the end of the first term. So half of that. But I don't have data that fast. So by the end of the first semester, the intervention effect had kicked in and it stayed there. So I don't know exactly when it kicked in but there it was. Okay. Keep going. Uhm, dropping grades. So grades are flat. We had hoped we would improve them but they at least didn't get worse and grades are, are declining with a, with an increase over time every quarter since baseline. Five minutes. Okay. Keep going. Ever quicker. Uhm, this is the path model (inaudible ) minutes, I won't go into it, but the point is that (inaudible ) did find the significant mediational paths that we expected, uhm, except with the, with the one ah, difference is that uhm, the school-focused possible selves, the balance and plausibility, actually mediated some kinds of, of sub-regulation, behaving while in class and doing homework, not others. Uhm, and school-focused possible selves did not influence the decision to not to cut class. What influenced it was the increased salience of feared off-track possible selves. "If I don't go to school, I will get in trouble. Bad things will happen to me. I will show up." And it was showing up and doing homework, but mostly showing up that reduced risk of depression by CESD(ph). Okay. Because if you're not in school in 8th and 9th Grade, you're not in a bond, you're just wondering around. It's depressing. Okay. Keep going please. Uhm, and at the two-year follow-up, the nature of the relationship between racial/ethnic identity in school focused possible selves was significantly different for intervention and control kids, 'coz remember, I said I wanted to show moderation there. So if you look at those, the next two slides please. Uhm, That, the school to job kids, there was a, these are regression rate so a bigger beta is better, okay. So, significant positive relationship between ah, racial/ethnic identity and school-focused possible selves, the possibility is that you have detailed ah, strategies, detailed concrete strategies as compared to control which is not a significant relationship. Next slide. Uhm, when you look just at the balance and do they have both positive and negative school-focused possible selves, positive relationship for the school ah, intervention kids and negative relationship for control kids. Keep going. Uhm. Okay. So that was, in my last couple of minutes, I'm going to tell what, whatever I can of other stuff. So the first issue is, "Can we make a difference?" Yes. Does it decay? No. In fact, it looks like it's getting better. The only piece of that initial flow chart that I did not measure, so I don't show you results on, is that I didn't explicitly measure whether in fact kids are able to say it, the fact that it feels hard doesn't de-motivate me. Okay. We assume that that's what happened. That's what all those sessions were for. So we're actually working on experiments now trying to get at that directly. Okay. Uhm, the other thing that I thought was important was I told you a story about how social context ought to be undermining and that's why we need this intervention. So what I wanna show you briefly now is some actual evidence that neighborhood, that there are negative neighborhood effects for low-income kids on these things. Uhm, So we looked at ah, parent and neighborhood effects and what we find is that for school-focused possible selves, as we had expected, income matters. So that's the story I told you about those moderate-income parents and they can do all this stuff. So in fact, yeah, we're getting uhm, some effects uhm, that uhm, the higher parent SES increases the plausibility. They have more detailed uhm, concrete strategies for attending their school-focused possible selves and more school-focused possible selves. And in addition, there is some interplay between parenting and environmental circumstances. Can you go, okay. You wanna stay there? Well moving right along, uhm, when you have high unemployment neighborhoods, then harsh discipline actually is uhm, bad for you. Okay. When you don't have high unemployment neighborhoods, it doesn't much matter, but it's that combination of not getting home, plu, and harsh parenting here isn't just authoritative. Okay, it's not just telling you what to do, it's throwing you out of the house, ridiculing you, so it's the, it's, it's mean parenting. So that plus, when you're thrown out of the house, what you get is lots of adults who are just wondering around, is quite undermining. Go, go to the next one. Uhm, parental monitoring. And all of this stuff sounds like things you've heard from delinquency and so forth, but no one has ever really looked at it for possible selves. So what do we see here? Well, monitoring doesn't really matter except if you're in neighborhoods with low residential stability. So when there's lots of sort of, you know another way people talk about a sort of chaos, so is all these people coming and going, then monitoring matters. Okay. Go to the next one. Uhm, what about those feared off-track possible selves? Where do they come from? There, we found really much more of an effect on neighborhood resources, and much more, the other ones, we didn't have race and gender interaction effects, but for these, we did. And for these ones, what we're finding is that there was a higher level of vulnerability for African-American boys. So neg, uhm, negative results in terms of not having enough feared off-track possible selves and strategies, when you're in high risk neighborhoods and you're African-American male. So uhm, keep going. Slides please. Uhm, so basically, as residential stability goes up, the dotted line are, are, are white kids, European-American kids. As residential stability goes up, they have fewer of those feared off-track ah, possible selves whereas African-Americans have more, and you might argue, you need more of them when it's more risky. Okay. Next, next slide. Uhm, this one is looking uhm, at neighborhood unemployment. And here again, you see the same thing. High neighborhood employment, you ought to have more and the two top lines are the girls and the two bottom lines are the boys. And the very bottom line that drops the sharpest and always is the lowest, that's the African-American boys. Okay. So they are not, it's not, for some reason, it's not kicking in. Now neighborhood level data can't tell us why; it just says that it's there. Go top the next one. Uhm, and that's the picture for strategies, and again, the, the bottom dotted line is African-American boys. In the left is low residential stability. So you should have the most of it. And the top lines are the girls. The bottom lines are the boys. So the boys in neighborhoods that have high instability have less of it. Less of those strategies for avoiding getting themselves into trouble. So even if they are worried, they're not thinking about how to, how to get out of that trouble. Okay. Ah. What do I have? Like two minutes, one minute, no minutes? No minutes. Okay. We also, actually, then I won't tell you, I'll just leave it on, on this slide. Uhm, we also actually asked the question, "Does, does parenting actually moderate the effects of the intervention?" Because a lot of people have said, "What you really need is really robust involved parenting and that also have all problems. And sure enough, very, very highly involved parents, their kids didn't need the intervention. The problem is it was really the most involved parents. And averagedly involved or low involved parents, their kids really did need the intervention, and that was looking at two years out. So at the very end of two years, parent involvement still could uhm, have an effect but most parents didn't have enough involvement to have an effect. So that's the work that I have been doing. What I am doing right now, because of the fact that you noticed everything was flat, I didn't improve anything, I just kept things from getting worse, is I'm going back and I'm testing to see, "Can we do this intervention in the beginning, as you enter middle school rather than as the end as you're exiting middle school?" Maybe I can either catch kids at a higher point or maybe get those lines to go up. So, thank you.
