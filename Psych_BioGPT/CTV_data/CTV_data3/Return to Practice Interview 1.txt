Return to Practice Interview 1 

00:00:05
UNKNOWN So, Norma(ph), we worked together for (inaudible ) years. 

00:00:10
NORMA We are. 

00:00:10
UNKNOWN I left the university a couple of years ago now. 

00:00:15
NORMA Yes. 

00:00:15
UNKNOWN You left it more recently. 

00:00:15
NORMA Yes. 

00:00:15
UNKNOWN And your plan was that by now having worked in voluntary agencies for years and years you would be in private practice. 

00:00:25
NORMA Yeah. 

00:00:25
UNKNOWN But you're not. 

00:00:25
NORMA I'm not. 

00:00:30
UNKNOWN What happened? 

00:00:30
NORMA Well, after making some very detailed plans about, uhm, setting up in private practice, uhm, and day would go wrong swimmingly because I had to say this on the date, ah, for retirement, you know, and I wanted everything in place. Uhm, you know, a, a time to process my leaving the university where you and I had worked, of, ah, doing some extra training. I was into certain online training of really setting up my counseling rule, you know, I decided to, to work at home. Uhm, working with my supervisor because he was aware of my plans, you know, and the, the plans that I made seemed to be set in concrete, were very certain. And then completely out of the blue, very unexpectedly, very suddenly, and quite traumatically my husband died and the very definite and clear plans that I had were blown clean at the, the water. And in the moment my husband died I became unfit for practice. 

00:01:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:01:55
NORMA Yeah. 

00:01:55
UNKNOWN So I heard you have been working in a shop. 

00:02:00
NORMA Yes. 

00:02:00
UNKNOWN Or in a bank or - 

00:02:00
NORMA Yes. 

00:02:00
UNKNOWN - pretty much any profession. 

00:02:00
NORMA Yeah. 

00:02:05
UNKNOWN Under those circumstance, you do had compassion to leave, you have taken time off, - 

00:02:10
NORMA Yeah. 

00:02:10
UNKNOWN - but by now you would have been back at work. 

00:02:15
NORMA Yes. 

00:02:15
UNKNOWN And what this is showing is that therapy is a very different kind of profession when it comes to personal loss or personal issues of some sort - 

00:02:25
NORMA Yes. Yes. 

00:02:25
UNKNOWN - that you suddenly found yourself feeling, and at first I could-- a feeling to trust, feeling that you couldn't practice. 

00:02:35
NORMA Yes. 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN What was that about? Why not? Why couldn't you practice? 

00:02:40
NORMA Because being a counselor demands a different kind of relationship with a client. It, it-- yeah, it, it expects you to be in quite a deep therapeutic relationship where you are empathizing deeply, where you're accepting that client, where you are open and congruently yourself. When my husband died, uhm, I lost the capacity to, to enter to any kind of deep relationship. It was just too, ah, too difficult, too painful. Ah, all I wanted to do was offset myself from the world and from people. I was too raw and it would have been impossible for me to have offered and to facilitate a kind of relationship that's required in a counseling relationship. And almost immediately I knew that I had lost the capacity to understand another person, uhm, I was just too wrapped up in my own grief to be able to give any energy any time, any space to anybody else who had a concern. Maybe he was bereaved in, in the same way that I was, you know. 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN So you just couldn't do it. 

00:04:10
NORMA No. It was impossible, it was impossible at that time. Uhm, and I think perhaps if my husband had been ill for a while, you know, I might have had time to prepare if I'd been working with clients, I might have had time to prepare them for the eventually of us having to break our relationships, ah, giving them the choice to, uhm, maybe wait until I was able to reconnect with them or move on to another counselor or indeed to (inaudible ) counseling on together. But that space wasn't-- it, it wasn't available to me. It was, it was so quick. 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN But I guess-- and there's a bit of a parallel there. If a therapist has an illness, - 

00:05:00
NORMA Uh-hmm. 

00:05:00
UNKNOWN - they just have, uhm, flew. 

00:05:00
NORMA Yeah. 

00:05:00
UNKNOWN They might take a week or two off. 

00:05:05
NORMA Yes, yes, yes. 

00:05:05
UNKNOWN So the-- you mind to being able to prepare in some ways - 

00:05:05
NORMA Yes 

00:05:05
UNKNOWN - if you're seeing clients - 

00:05:10
NORMA Yes. 

00:05:10
UNKNOWN But even so, my guess is, is that preparation would have been completely a knock on the head. 

00:05:15
NORMA Yes. 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN It would have been pointless in a sense because nevertheless that devastation - 

00:05:20
NORMA Yes. 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN - would occur - 

00:05:20
NORMA Yes. 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN - whether we prepare for it or not. 

00:05:25
NORMA Uh-hmm. 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN I guess another thing I'm thinking of, ah, unless it might be further down the line but it sounds like you're saying I simply couldn't do it. But I'm wondering whether one of the things that you would find impossible is to go into areas with clients that mind touch things yourself. 

00:05:50
NORMA Very much so. In the approach that I take which is a person centered approach, ah, one of the, the core qualities that counselor uses is to empathize, is to understand the client from their frame of reference, to see the world their glasses, you know. But I've always, you know, being able to do that at, at, at quite a, a deep relational level. When I became bereaved, I simply couldn't do it. It was quite threatening, it was as if I'd lost the second sense, I just couldn't-- I had, ah, couldn't understanding what they were saying or I just didn't want to understand. I did not want to have any more sorrow, any more problems, any more concerns. I was brimful with my own grief where I didn't have to capacity to enter into another person's world. And that was it, that was mainly what it was but there were flash-- understanding what another person was saying and then I'd be engaged and then the, you know, the interaction would finish and I would find myself totally exhausted by it, really, really exhausted. My head would be buzzing, I'd be breathless with it, and I thought this is not good for me and if I was working with a client this would not-- certainly not be good for them. 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN So-- it's, it's a bit like it. I'm reminded of when a therapist is seeing too many clients or - 

00:07:20
NORMA Uh-hmm. 

00:07:20
UNKNOWN - or sees too many in a day. At the end of the day, they were, "Hmm, that, that-- I shouldn't have booked in there, extra one there." That's, that's too much. 

00:07:30
NORMA But this was much more instantaneous. 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:07:30
NORMA You know... 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN You completely overload it by your own experience. 

00:07:35
NORMA A few more-- a few minutes when they're talking about working for no one, this would be just a few minutes, you know, that's, that's how it was. 

00:07:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:45
NORMA That one. And you will think about coming about, uhm, to work with clients and that state would have been totally unethical, you know, just not on the toll. And these number of months on, ah, 15 months on, this is something that I'm on littering very, very carefully my ability and my capacity to empathize with another and it's increasing the, the amount of time that I can spend listening to a person and understanding and entering to-- into their world is, is, is longer than those flashes, those of minutes that they had. But there's that same sort of tension either I'm not interested, I don't want to be interested or if I am interested and I enter into, you know, that empathic way of listening then it tires me. But the-- it's lengthening, yeah, my capacity to stay with somebody who is telling about their problems is increasing. 

00:08:55
UNKNOWN It's, it's kind of interesting cuz a lot of people get drawn to this work because they find friends, generally, - 

00:09:05
NORMA Yes. 

00:09:05
UNKNOWN - talking a lot about their problems. 

00:09:05
NORMA Yes. 

00:09:05
UNKNOWN We, we know the number of prospective students that will come and say-- or people say that I'm easy to talk to, a lot of people come to me with their problems. 

00:09:15
NORMA Yes. 

00:09:15
UNKNOWN So I now want training to do it in public. And it, it sounds like almost that is a sort of monitor for you how much you can listen to friends - 

00:09:25
NORMA Yes. 

00:09:25
UNKNOWN - talking - 

00:09:25
NORMA Yeah. Yes. 

00:09:30
UNKNOWN - to know whether you could listen... 

00:09:30
NORMA Friends and families as well, you know, - 

00:09:30
UNKNOWN Yes. Yes. 

00:09:30
NORMA - colleagues. 

00:09:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:09:35
NORMA Uhm, uhm, when I'm in supervision because I have, I have returned to supervision to, to monitor my, my progress. Uhm, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm very aware of how I notice what's happening to me, uhm, when I'm listening and when I'm not listening. I think back at the beginning I was just, uhm, completely in myself, you know. I just was so shocked and numb and, uhm, but then it, it, it, it' changing gradually, it is changing gradually. 

00:10:15
UNKNOWN Tell me a bit about the supervision, how you're using that, cuz this is-- how much supervision for you as a practitioner who's not currently practicing. 

00:10:25
NORMA Yes. Yes. Yeah. 

00:10:25
UNKNOWN So how do you use it? 

00:10:25
NORMA Yeah. It's-- of course, I haven't got any clients to be discussing and, you know, ah, I'm not talking about my process with those clients that they don't have. But what I am talking about is my process, uhm, in thinking about and considering will I return to practice. Because it, it, it still is uncertain for me, you know, and I talk in terms of, yeah, in similar terms to work you and I had just discussed about how my empathic understanding is increasing. Am I able to accept, ah, what my friends, my family, my colleagues are saying or am sort of still trying to push it away? 

00:11:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) about that. 

00:11:20
NORMA Yes. And, and I might talk about an instance, I might talk about it general terms but it's-- I guess, what I'm really looking at is my, my inner experience which I, I really want to respect, I really want to, uhm,-- because there's a conflict about should I return, I really ought to return against, "No, Norma(ph), you're not ready for it in any way." And it's not just about the ethical, it's, it's about, ah, you know, the, the ethical considerations on clients. It's about me being ethical about myself - 

00:12:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:12:05
NORMA - and self-care - 

00:12:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:12:05
NORMA - as well. 

00:12:10
UNKNOWN I'm thinking of... 

00:12:10
NORMA You know, to find the balance between I ought to but look, look after yourself. This is much important. 

00:12:15
UNKNOWN Without (inaudible ) I guess it will be a question for me about well, where did that "ought" - 

00:12:20
NORMA Yes. 

00:12:20
UNKNOWN - come from? 

00:12:20
NORMA Yes. 

00:12:20
UNKNOWN I guess that's-- well, that was my plan. 

00:12:25
NORMA Uh-hmm. 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN That was my plan. 

00:12:25
NORMA Oh, yes. 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN Well, the other thing I'm struck with is this is a bit mundane that people quite often and I know I was at the start of my training impressed by the hour rate of a counselor and (inaudible ) only. They had quite a lot of money, you know, ah, but the reality is you can't do it 40 hours a week, the training is lengthy and expensive, there are times in life when you need to take a bit of time off and (inaudible ) for any self-employed person. But then sometimes life can overwhelm you and you're not working for months and months and years and it's almost like you're saying, "And maybe I've become redundant." 

00:13:15
NORMA Yeah. 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN Maybe I can't do this job ever again. 

00:13:20
NORMA And the idea that I had about myself, - 

00:13:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:13:25
NORMA - the image that I had about myself as a counselor, as a, uhm, as a supervisor might also be in at a loss for me that I might have to, ah, work through as I am working through the grief and the loss of my, of my husband. But it's-- one of the considerations and one of the, you know, the things that I'm really thinking about is because I had quite a good salary when I was working at the university. I was the sole breadwinner because my husband was retired. That's gone. 

00:14:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:14:05
NORMA And now I'm on a very much reduced, uhm, income and to be able to go into practice would provide me with a living. So it's quite frightening to know that, you know, in a few months' time, in a years' time my decision might be that I'm still not ready that perhaps I don't even want to go back into counseling or supervision. And then what do I do about an income? 

00:14:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:14:40
NORMA Where do I go from there? 

00:14:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:14:40
NORMA That's, that's quite frightening. 

00:14:40
UNKNOWN Because the plan all along took you in a very clear direction, - 

00:14:45
NORMA Yes. 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN - your life for as long as I've known you - 

00:14:50
NORMA Yeah. 

00:14:50
UNKNOWN - has been working in that direction - 

00:14:50
NORMA Yes. 

00:14:50
UNKNOWN - in this field and suddenly that door has closed. 

00:15:00
NORMA With a bang. 

00:15:00
UNKNOWN With a bang. And then they locked and it sounds like you may not be locking it but you got no will or wish to try and pries the door open. You know it needs to be locked. 

00:15:10
NORMA Yes. And if it opens I think it has to open on its own accord not because I need an income - 

00:15:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:15:20
NORMA - or I ought to get back to counseling or supervision. It's because I'm ready for it and that it's-- the-- there's a shift in my perception of myself as well, you know. It, it, it was the image that I had, the private practitioner, you know, all set up and something has to shift about that for me as well in this-- that's another thing that I'm looking up in supervision. 

00:15:50
UNKNOWN Was that going to be the pinnacle of your career? Years of training how to counsel, years of working with clients and agencies and then you know the business, you, you knew this world, you are immersed in it. And then to be a private practitioner at the end of your career. 

00:16:15
NORMA Yes. It was bi-­- it was something about giving something back as well and having the, the time, uhm, the luxury, if you like, of just concentrating on being a counselor and not having it sort of dissipated in-- into training and, you know, assessments and, ah, going professional development, all that sort of stuff. I could have just concentrate on being with clients because there are-- in, in all my work there have been two loves, if you like. It's being working as, ah, a tutor, working with students and working with clients. Uhm, the, you know, the-- this plan although it's very structured, at the end, there was this sort of open space where I could just have, you know, being in that position of just being, ah, a counselor or, or a supervisor. It, it was, it was a sort of-- how the gold glow to, if you know what I mean. 

00:17:20
UNKNOWN Okay. You know, we've, we've gotten a sense of the story that's got to open. But if we were to talk in terms of an athlete say who breaks a leg there would be a very clear set of procedures. Once a leg is fixed there would be clear set of procedures that the athlete would take part in in order to be back into their spot, they would know what was expected of them. 

00:17:50
NORMA Yes. 

00:17:50
UNKNOWN I'm wondering whether you have any sense of well, if I do this, then I might more quickly get back into practice. 

00:18:05
NORMA I just wanna say I don't want to put a time limit on, on it. I don't want to say that I can get quickly back into practice. It's, it's more-- I wanted to be more of-- I want it to be a slower process for me so that I'm absolutely certain. I want to not concentrate on the, the art to get back, I want to be ready and feel and experience that I'm ready and I'm doing that in a number of ways. Uhm, it's im-- it's become important for me to, uhm, to experience my grief not to, not to bury it and, uhm, one of the things that I have to give up because of my reduced income was therapy. And so I had to find a way of still being able to express my grief which is quite difficult when you have friends, close friends and family. Uhm, although they are more than willing to, to listen I think I'm a bit reluctant to actually say it out. 

00:19:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:19:15
NORMA And so I have to find the different way of processing my grief, of expressing the experience that I have of it. And what I decided to do was to start a blog which you might find quite interesting and that's what I do. I, I, again, I don't want to make it that it's I have to do this blog, it's quite organic and quite often it's done in the moment if I have, ah, a feeling or a series of thoughts or an event that really strikes me that I need to, to explore, I open up my laptop and, ah, the site that I have-- and I start writing about it and it gives me actually quite a, a, a freedom to really explore what's going on for me and it addresses that part of me that needs to be looked at during this return if it's a return to practice. 

00:20:25
UNKNOWN I'm just, I'm just interested cuz knowing you and your-- perhaps phobia about technology, that would be fair-- I would expect for you to say I keep a journal. 

00:20:40
NORMA Yeah. 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN But you chose to keep a blog - 

00:20:40
NORMA Yes. 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN - which is a public... 

00:20:45
NORMA Yes. 

00:20:45
UNKNOWN Can you... 

00:20:45
NORMA I haven't gone public really yet. 

00:20:50
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:20:50
NORMA It's still in a journal form and... 

00:20:50
UNKNOWN So it's not available to other people. 

00:20:50
NORMA Not available yet. 

00:20:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:20:55
NORMA But I think it might well be. 

00:20:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:20:55
NORMA Uhm, I can't be the only person who is a counselor, who has become bereaved and I also think, uhm, that even for counselors it's, it's a difficult process, it's a painful raw process that sometimes can't be express, can't be explained. And what I found is that there are a lot of aspects of my grief that are similar-- that I can read up in the books, you know. I've taught this stuff, I, I've worked with bereaved clients for many, many years and there are similarities in my experience, to the people that I've read about, that I've worked about-- worked with. The blog is interesting for me because what I'm exploring are the differences - 

00:21:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:22:00
NORMA - and if I put it out, it's something I want to say to other people that it will be similar but it will be so, so different as well and to worry about - 

00:22:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:22:15
NORMA - the differences, not to be afraid of the differences, not to be afraid that it hasn't been written up, or that you haven't heard about it from anybody else, you're not going crazy, you're not going mad, it's just your unique experience. 

00:22:30
UNKNOWN What I think is worth saying-- well, well, one of the things that we would have been doing right now if we haven't already done that after you'd left the university - 

00:22:40
NORMA Yeah. 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN - was to settle down to make the video on bereavement - 

00:22:40
NORMA Yes. 

00:22:45
UNKNOWN - or loss because that is your area of expertise. 

00:22:50
NORMA Yes. 

00:22:50
UNKNOWN That's why we even done that. So it's in a sense you're the expert on this stuff but it's no help at all. 

00:23:00
NORMA No help, whatsoever. No-- uhm, in, in a way it's made it more difficult because there's another art. I know this stuff. I should have been prepared for it, you know, I should know how to think, behave, feel, - 

00:23:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:23:15
NORMA - uhm, I mean, it hasn't worked out like that at all, you know, not at all. 

00:23:20
UNKNOWN Ah, I guess the way which it has worked out just as you would have expected had we have this conversation a couple of years ago is that completely uncertainty about how grief impacts. 

00:23:35
NORMA That's the one thing that I can say for certain, how uncertain grief is and how uncertain the world becomes because of it. You know, uhm, yeah, it, it, it's, it's a strange tension between all this solid plans that they had made, precise plans that they had made sort of disappeared into the mist and I now live in a-- in, in quite an uncertain world. And that's why I can't say for certain whether I'm going to return. I don't know. I don't know. I hope I can. I hope I can but I've got to be prepared for the possibility that I might not. 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN Well, hearing you talk about preparation, I, I was just thinking, Norma(ph) always been someone who is prepared, - 

00:24:25
NORMA Oh yes. 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN - who, who makes life certain, certainly your professional life, makes life certain. I've got the exercise with the student, I've got this stuff to do if the students want to follow a particular direction and prepare for eventualities. 

00:24:40
NORMA Yes. 

00:24:40
UNKNOWN And suddenly that flows you into somewhere where you can't be prepared. 

00:24:50
NORMA And, you know, counseling is uncertain anyway when you're entering to a relationship with a, a client, it's uncertain where it's going to go, how the relationship is going to develop, what the outcomes will be, uhm, but I think the ardent uncertainty I have about my own life would really make me feel quite unsettled, you know, quite unable. I'd be too, too absorbed with my uncertainties - 

00:25:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:25:25
NORMA - to deal with somebody else's. And you mentioned earlier that my area of expertise is in bereavement, that's the kind of counseling that I want to go back to so I've got to make sure that I am-- that I have a strong foundation to go back into this kind of work as I possibly can, you know. 

00:25:50
UNKNOWN Because counselors say things that ordinary people, ordinary people-- the untrained people don't say. 

00:26:00
NORMA Yes. 

00:26:00
UNKNOWN They allow their clients to say things that maybe their friends don't say. And if you, as a therapist, can't do that because it's too painful for you - 

00:26:15
NORMA Yes. 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN - then you can't do the job. 

00:26:20
NORMA Yes. Yeah. And I could say I won't go back to the bereavement counseling. That's, that's very seductive. 

00:26:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. But... 

00:26:30
NORMA But loss is part of a human experience and, ah, as sure as eggs crack. What my clients would be talking about in one form or the other would be loss even if it isn't a bereavement loss and I'd immediately be thrown into, "Oh my goodness, that's what I was thinking. That was what I was feeling, that's how disoriented I was." And, again, I would not be empathizing, I'd be perhaps over involving myself sympathizing, uhm, yet not being in that relationship that may be going into the safety of well, let's see what we can do about your grief. 

00:27:10
UNKNOWN Well, yeah, but-- I mean, most are thinking you may have a client who is working with childhood issues - 

00:27:15
NORMA Yes. 

00:27:15
UNKNOWN - or issues of self-esteem, whatever and suddenly they become bereaved. 

00:27:20
NORMA Yes. 

00:27:25
UNKNOWN That-- it, it certainly happened to me when I was in therapy. My mother died, ah, but it was great to have my therapist at that time. You couldn't really be saying, "Look, I'm sorry. You kicked out too much stuff on me. I need you to take some timeout from therapy." 

00:27:45
NORMA Yeah. Yeah. So it's, it's this kind of consideration and many more that I'm working through and it, and it's, it's in the note of my thoughts, you know, uhm, am I ready, will I be ready, what are the things that are stopping me? I mean, what are the things that drives me really to frustration? Is that I forget things, very, very simple things. I mean, I find how it happened. I don't know but I found my keys in my fridge and I have no idea whatsoever how they got there that can you imagine me working with a client and really deep into their process and all of a sudden I realized I can't remember a thing about what they've said. And that would be, you know, that would be really-- it could be very, very detrimental and even harmful to the client and to the relationship that we're having, you know. 

00:28:55
UNKNOWN Okay, so we've been talking about you as a therapist, - 

00:29:00
NORMA Yes. 

00:29:00
UNKNOWN - as a practitioner but I know from lots of conversations we've had over the last year that you are working again as a counseling trainer, you have students. 

00:29:10
NORMA Yes. Yes, I do. Uhm, when I-- when Ron(ph) died, I took-- I think it was 3 months off work and then I came back not to teach but to do administrative tasks to I had-- I was working it to my retirement and I, I grieve in my colleagues and my line manager walk, I need it to do before I finished. And, you know, I, I question myself why do I actually need to return? And it was trying to find a balance between, ah, finding a structure in my life and it's, it's that, you know, balance between processing my grief and experiencing it but also having to step out into something that was quite concrete and, you know, gave me purpose structure. And it was during that time when I came back to work in a university that I was offered, ah, a small amount of training work with students and it wasn't going to be until the October. It would only be for a few hours a week and I thought about it greatly and I also took it to supervision. It was one of the things that we talked about whether I would be ready-- whether I would be able to do that because as you know, working as a counseling tutor has a toll. 

00:30:40
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:30:40
NORMA And what I found-- and it, it, it sort of give me some insight as well into how I'm developing my, ah, building up my empathic understanding is that for that brief time that I'm there I can do the, the lecturing bet, that's, that's the simpler part of it but I can, for the small amount of time that I'm with the students, engage in the, the process group as well. And I seem to be able to manage it and this is what I was alluding to earlier. When those-- I was finished, I'm pretty tired after - 

00:31:20
UNKNOWN Ah, yeah. 

00:31:20
NORMA - that I seemed to be managing thought I monitor it very carefully again with my supervisor. We talked about, you know, what might be happening because I'm pretty aware of myself as, as a tutor and how I might be impacting and how the students might be impacting on me. That's always been a way that I've supervised my work and the relationship that I have with them and what might be affecting that and we talk about perhaps an incident, perhaps a student, perhaps a group of student, perhaps a dynamic within, uhm, the student process group of how I am within that. What's happening for me? How is my experience of grief being, you know, how am I as a recovering bereaved person if you like - 

00:32:15
UNKNOWN Right. Right. 

00:32:20
NORMA - when challenged with a small group of students. 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN And I guess the other things I'm, I'm thinking is I can imagine how the lecturing will be pretty straight forward. 

00:32:30
NORMA Yes. 

00:32:30
UNKNOWN That would be just like going back to the job - 

00:32:30
NORMA Yes. Yes. 

00:32:30
UNKNOWN - you're working in a factory or whatever. You're engaging with people. 

00:32:35
NORMA It's almost the default decision I can do with that. 

00:32:40
UNKNOWN But the group work, the dynamics are tougher but then I'm also wondering about the kind of pastoral nature of tutorials and things like that. 

00:32:50
NORMA Yeah. 

00:32:50
UNKNOWN That's where I guess you're more vulnerable - 

00:32:50
NORMA Yes. Yes. 

00:32:50
UNKNOWN - to being so wiped out by someone else who (inaudible ). 

00:32:55
NORMA Yeah. And I think what I've noticed about myself (inaudible ) I, I've got to be careful that I don't slip into a sort of, uhm, parental role which is, is sort of protective of me, you know, to look after the students instead of really letting them develop as they wish, you know, to facilitate it rather than-- and I've got-- I've really noticed that and it's let me to think of how I protect myself when I, uhm, refused to engage with friends, family, what happens to me when I do engage, you know. It's, it's been, it's been an interesting time. 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN So let me just see if I was right. The-- there's a worry that, that your act to the students is different to how you have all - 

00:33:55
NORMA Yes. Yes. 

00:33:55
UNKNOWN - (inaudible ) before. That you be more protective. 

00:34:00
NORMA Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's around the uncertainty, I think, as if I can protect them from the world. 

00:34:05
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:34:10
NORMA Like I couldn't protect - 

00:34:10
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:34:10
NORMA - myself - 

00:34:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:34:10
NORMA - which is-- it's, it's a, it's a real awareness that I have of why do it. You know, it's, it's that, uhm, how-- when you're bereaved you become very vulnerable, very, uhm, afraid, I guess and frightened of what might happen to you. And I've got to be careful that I'm not just doing this to myself but that I'm - 

00:34:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:34:35
NORMA - doing it to the cla-- to the students as well, you know, like overprotecting them. 

00:34:40
UNKNOWN I was thinking overprotected parallel. 

00:34:45
NORMA Yes. Yes. 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN And not letting the child at risks. Yeah. 

00:34:50
NORMA Yeah. 

00:34:50
UNKNOWN Is there anything else to talk about now? 

00:34:55
NORMA The bit about self-care I think that is an important issue. It, it always has been an issue for me about balancing, what I give to others, about-- as opposed to what I give to myself and I think it's become really important to me that I find a way, a better way of looking after myself and to find the balance between what I give out to others, to students, as what I've take in to nurture myself. And a way that I found and it, it, it really surprised me was that, uhm, it was by chance. You noticed the hair so I go to a salon and they have my youth restored to me in a plastic bowl. But it also happens that they do alternative therapies, you know, and, uhm, the person, the young woman, ah, ah, was engaged with this how to go for a maternity leave. So they had they the student in and they were offering massage, aroma therapy for a much reduced rate. So I thought, "Uh-huh. I wonder." And I thought, "Right, come on. This is the way that you're going to look after yourself," and I opted into it. And I found that surprisingly helpful because part of the way that I grieve is that I, I get quite stress, I get quite anxious and I hold the anxiety in my shoulders, makes it quite painful, physically painful and to have a regular aroma therapy is somewhere that I can look after my physical self instead of my emotional self as well. 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN So I guess there's something here. There, there's almost quite right and that we've always understood but if you're going to look after other people - 

00:37:05
NORMA Yes. 

00:37:05
UNKNOWN - you've got to be looking after yourself too. 

00:37:05
NORMA Absolutely. It's not an option. 

00:37:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. It's got to be not. 

00:37:10
NORMA It's not an option. 

00:37:10
UNKNOWN And your priority right now - 

00:37:10
NORMA Yes. 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN - is about looking after you. 

00:37:15
NORMA Yes. Because if the hope is to translated, a big part of that is looking after myself, nurturing myself, giving myself a space to be absolutely certain that it's not about ought to get back because it will be that I'm ready and I want to and that I can give something back as well. 

00:37:40
UNKNOWN Okay.
