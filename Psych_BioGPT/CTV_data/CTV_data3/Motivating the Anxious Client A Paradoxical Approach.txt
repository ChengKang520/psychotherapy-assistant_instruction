RICH SIMON Welcome everyone. My name's Rich Simon. I'm editor of Psychotherapy Networker and I'm your host for this series on Treating Anxiety: Latest Advances. So over the next six interviews, we're going to be looking at some of the latest ideas on treatment of anxiety and talking with some of the real innovators of our field, specialists in dealing with particularly with anxiety disorders of all kinds. And we're very fortunate here to begin in our first session with a conversation with David Burns. David is, has written two of the most successful books that anyone in our field has written over the last several decades, Feeling Good and When Panic Attacks. He's one of a leading exponents of CBT and somebody who's been on the workshop circuit and who's written widely on a range of topics in psychotherapy, anxiety being one of his specialties. So we'll be talking with David today about some of the techniques he's developed over the years and particularly with the issue of resistance in anxiety treatment. So without further ado, let's get David in here. David, good afternoon, how are you? 

00:01:25
DAVID BURNS Good, good. Thank you for having me, Rich. I'm really looking forward to this. 

00:01:30
RICH SIMON I'm feeling very festive looking at your shirt. Very alive, very California. 

00:01:35
DAVID BURNS It's about 30 years old but somehow the cloth is holding up well. 

00:01:40
RICH SIMON It's bringing out your inner Jimi Hendrix. 

00:01:45
DAVID BURNS Yes. 

00:01:45
RICH SIMON Okay, so let's, you, let's... you're very forthcoming about your own experiences of anxiety during your life. And one, I remember reading one experience in particular about your, a drama teacher in high school who taught you a very important lesson about dealing with anxiety. So you, just talk a little bit about your own experiences with anxiety, overcoming it, and if you could, tell us a little bit about Mr. Bishop. 

00:02:15
DAVID BURNS Right, right. Well, that was I'm sure a disguised name, but when I wrote When Panic Attacks, I started noticing all the anxiety disorders I've had and by the time it was published, I had counted up to 11. I had 11 different anxiety disorders but then after then 

00:02:35
RICH SIMON Congratulations 

00:02:35
DAVID BURNS I thought of 4 others that, that I'd forgotten about. So whatever a patient has, I could say boy, I know what that's like. 

00:02:45
RICH SIMON Been there done that. 

00:02:50
DAVID BURNS And how much that sucks. And I can also show you the way out of the woods and what a joy it's going to be to, to show you how to change your life. And I think that's one of the reasons that I just love treating all forms of anxiety. 

00:03:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:03:05
DAVID BURNS Back when I was in high school, you know they say that anxiety is partially genetic. And I suspect that's true. My mother had a lot of fears and one of her fears was the fear of heights, and when I was little I had no fear of heights. It seemed funny to me that she was afraid of heights. But by the time I got into high school, for some reason I had developed the fear of heights. And I wanted to be on the stage crew of Brigadoon. My counselor said that I needed more extracurricular activities so I could get into a good college, and I had none so I went to the drama teacher, we'll call him Mr. Bishop, and he said well, David, we'd love to have you on the, working, you know on the crew for Brigadoon in the stage crew but the only thing is we can't have any students who have a fear of heights cause you have to work up, you know, up at the ceiling on a ladders and with the curtains and the lights and all of that. I said well, I have a fear of heights and he said well, you can't be on the stage crew of Brigadoon unless you'd be willing to get over that. And I said well, I'd be willing to get over that but you know, I don't know how to do that. And he said, well we can do it right now if you want. And I said great, what, how do I do it. So he took me into the theater and on the stage he put up a tall ladder, maybe a 12 foot high ladder, an 18 foot high ladder, one of those V ladders, and he put it in the middle where there were no curtains or anything to grab onto and he said all you have to do is you know, walk up and stand on the top of that ladder for a while. So I said, okay Mr. Bishop but if that's, that's what I'm supposed to do, I'll do it. I was young and trusting. He said I'll stand down here at the bottom and wait. So I got up to the top and I was just terrified. I was 100 out of 100 on the you know, panic scale, and I said what should I do now, Mr. Bishop? I'm, I'm really scared, and he said well just, just stand there and wait. Once you're cured, you know, tell me and then you can come on down. And so I stood there about 15 minutes and it was still 100 out of 100. I said nothing's changed yet, Mr. Bishop. I'm still really terrified. He said well, just, just stay there, you know, stick it out, you're doing fine. And then in another minute, the fear suddenly went from 100 to 0. It just dropped in five seconds, like being hit by lightning or something. And I said oh I think I'm cured now Mr. Bishop. And he said, okay, you can come on down. You can be on the stage crew of Brigadoon. So I went down and after that, I just loved going up to the ceiling and climbing around and I couldn't even remember how I could have possibly had a fear of heights, so that was I think my first, my first experience with effective treatment for anxiety and one thing it taught me is anxiety can, can nearly always be cured completely and quickly, and now we've developed many sophisticated techniques. Always the goal is to cause a rapid and total elimination of symptoms. 

00:06:25
RICH SIMON Okay, so now, within the, with all the perspective you've gained in the 40 or so years since that time, it's great when that works and one time exposure extinguishes the response, and you go as if it's you description at least that you never had it. But it, it's, sometimes at least it doesn't work that way. 

00:06:50
DAVID BURNS Exactly, yea. That's right. You can't just have one technique like exposure and hope to be able to cure most patients. Usually it's more sophisticated, more complex and we've, I've actually, I work with four powerful models in treating anxiety and I find if you use all four models with every patient, you can nearly always get a complete elimination of symptoms, but most mental health professionals, they want to do one thing. The cognitive therapists want to do cognitive therapy. The behaviorists want to do exposure, and the EMDR people want to do EMDR. Everyone has this kind of one thing, but we've found that by integrating several powerful models, we get the best result. 

00:07:35
RICH SIMON Okay. So yea, you can't be a Johnny or Joanna One Note. So it's, now you've developed a, and you've written for these various, these four different models and forty different techniques you talk about. Recently there's a particular method that you have indicated you've been using, really enhances whatever other techniques that you're using. And maybe let's start off with that, with this kind of, this paradoxical, I believe you call it paradoxical agenda setting, which is a method, is kind of a part of the early process of how you work with your anxiety clients. So talk just a little bit, how, what's the, what do you do and what' s it's role in treatment and why have you, why do you think it's so important that therapists pay attention to this kind of paradoxical agenda setting. 

00:08:30
DAVID BURNS Well, it's a powerful technique that we use not only for anxiety but for depression, relationship problems, habits and addictions. But it plays out differently for each of those four targets. And we developed a concept called outcome resistance and process resistance. And outcome resistance you can think in terms of the idea of a magic button. Say to the patients, suppose there's a magic button here on the table and if you press that button, you'll walk out of today's session in a state of euphoria. There's no effort and all your problems will disappear. If it's depression your depression and self-criticism will disappear. If it's anxiety, all of your fears will instantly disappear. Will you press that button? Well, the patient always says yes, I'll press the button. And then you say yes, but I can think of some good reasons not to. And then you, then you begin to talk about outcome resistance, the part of the patient that's actually, in a case of anxiety, afraid of a good outcome. And outcome resistance for anxiety has to do with magical thinking. Almost all patients with anxiety on the one hand they're suffering terribly, whether it's panic attacks or OCD or phobias or whatever. On another level, the patient thinks that the anxiety is helping them or protecting them in some way and that if they gave up the anxiety, something terrible would happen. I can give you an example of that if you want. 

00:10:00
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:10:00
DAVID BURNS A young man came to me in Philadelphia with six months of classic post traumatic stress disorder. He had been working here at Temple University which is a violent area here in Philadelphia. He was working ina Burger King, and he was the last to close up at night, and just before he closed up, two armed gunmen came in and kind of sadistically robbed the place and before they left, they threw him into a walk-in freezer and locked him in there and left him there to freeze to death and went out laughing you know, at what clever thing that they had done. The next morning the manager came in early, saw the doors open, the lights on, realized that something was wrong, opened the freezer, and found Sam huddled but still alive and traumatized by this event. And then he, he recovered physically but developed all the classic symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder very, very severe. In fact, when he came to me, he said that pretty much 18 hours a day, he was having flashbacks of the event, terrified that he'd run into some violent people and get mugged again, along with rage attacks, where he would imagine finding these men and killing them or getting revenge on them or having them arrested. He would also wake up in the middle of the night with panic attacks and rage and this type of thing and he asked is there any hope for, for someone as severe as me? And I said hey, we've got new techniques, we've got cognitive techniques to change the, the thoughts that are creating the anxiety. We've got visual imaging techniques to help you change these catastrophic daydreams, flashbacks and images in your mind, and the prognosis is actually positive. In fact, not only is there a good chance we can reduce your anxiety, there's a really good chance we can make it disappear entirely, the rage and the anxiety and furthermore, in my experience, it usually doesn't take much time. I, it, I can't make a definite prediction and that's not ethical to do that but it would be my hunch that you know, it might only take us 2 or 3 or 4 sessions and you'll be good to go. Now I thought he would like this because here, here's a person who's suffering incredibly and saying is there any hope and I, I'm saying there's hope beyond what you're hoping for. I mean, it's, I can deliver you know, I can make your dream come true. And you think he'd be happy about that but he's suddenly turned against me like I was some kind of an enemy and sort of swearing at me and where did I come off and who did I think I was and this is all a lot of bologna. And suddenly I was shocked. Here I'm, I've got these wonderful techniques, offer them to someone who's suffering and suddenly he's rejecting it. And that's prototypic resistance and it happens in depression, it happens with people who have trouble with marriages, happens with people with addictions as well. And for years, I helped to create a lot of what's now known as cognitive therapy. There were not many of us in the early days, and Beck was coming up with his great thinking and we were creating techniques, many techniques a week. And we used to think when someone isn't responding, it's because we don't have enough techniques and so we created more and more and more techniques. But now, we look at it very differently and the cause of nearly all therapeutic failure is the failure of the therapist to set the agenda, to deal with the patient's resistance. Now on Sam's case, it was very easy. We have about 15 or more techniques or more to deal with therapeutic resistance and one of the simplest is a cost benefit analysis. What are the advantages and disadvantages, Sam, of experiencing tremendous panic and tremendous rage. Let's list the advantages, maybe I'm kind of overlooking something important. And he came up with a lot of advantages. First he said the anxiety keeps him safe, that it keeps him vigil, and if her were to let that down, maybe he really would get murdered or killed, that it would be you know, ridiculous to let go of that anxiety living in this dangerous area. And then he pointed out also that the anger showed that he was a man, that he had feelings, that he wasn't going to let these men walk all over him and then feel happy about it. That makes him kind of like a passive doormat, he said, hell no, Dr. Burns, I have every right to be angry. Those guys deserve my anger. And then the third, he said if I could be cured in two or three sessions that would show that what happened to me was trivial, but that wasn't trivial. That was a horrible thing that practically ruined my life. Now we have the concept paradoxical agenda setting and what that means is you don't try to persuade the patient to change. Instead you become the voice of the patients subconscious resistance and try to persuade the patient to remain the same. And you have to do it with warmth and genuineness. It can't be done as a gimmick. So I simply said to Sam, I can see where I been barking up the wrong tree. What you're saying makes a lot of sense. It would be dangerous to let your guard down, it is dangerous in that part of Philadelphia, and you have every right to be angry. What those guys did was sadistic and was cruel and also I think I probably failed to empathize with you and how horrible it's been what you've been through and sure, if we could make that go away in three sessions, that would be insulting to you in a way. And to be honest with you, I, I'm sold on staying the same. Maybe this isn't something that we should try to eliminate. And what we've seen is 90% of the time or more, when you become the voice of the patient's subconscious resistance, then suddenly the patient doesn't have to argue that case anymore because you are arguing it for the patient and then they jump to the other side. And what he said is yes, but aren't we supposed to do the disadvantage column? Isn't there a downside? And I said okay, yea, I guess that's true. What price are you paying to maintain all of this rage and all of this panic. And he said, well number one, I don't know that the anxiety keeps me safe. Maybe the bad guys can smell it when you're scared and maybe they're more likely to mug you. I said well that's a good point. And how about the anger. I said, you've got every right to be angry,and he says, yea, but I've got the right to be happy too, and those guys don't even know that I'm angry. They're probably in Florida robbing 7-11's and I'll probably never see them again, so I'm the one who's suffering. And I said, yes, but if we could make the symptoms go away so quickly, that would trivialize what happened to you. And he says, yea but I could experience joy a lot faster too. So then I said, okay, how, what's it going to be? Is it 50/50, 60/40, how do you balance these? He said it's 35/65, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Those advantages are real, but now I see what you're talking about. Teach me those skills. So I just used simple stuff, the daily mood log, visual imaging techniques, and it took about three sessions and his anxiety was you know, disappeared completely, and he was able to terminate treatment. If I hadn't dealt with the resistance up front, all the other techniques would have been very ineffective. 

00:18:15
RICH SIMON Okay so we're going to come back and talk about your, how you perceive and how you organize. But before we move on, this sounds like a extraordinarily, to my ears, articulate point. You find that typically clients are so, they warm to this particular approach so easily and they're able to articulate all these disadvantages of change even at the time where presumably before you introduce this question, this is not something that has occurred to them before. They're very concerned with getting rid of whatever it is that they're experiencing and that's why they're coming to see you. 

00:19:00
DAVID BURNS The, the therapist needs quite a bit of training to learn how to do this, and it's one of the things I teach in workshops and it's kind of shocking to therapists how different this is from the way they usually think and you have to begin to understand why someone with depression really might want to remain depressed and the things you read about motivation in textbooks, I think are not accurate. They're these kind of generalizations that oh, the person, it's their identity or something like that, or they're afraid of change. Things that don't really ring true on the individual level and so it's really the therapist who needs to be able to think about resistance cause the patient has never thought about it, and it's a severe form, it's a deep form of empathy because you're really not only empathizing what the patient is saying and feeling inside but you're also beginning to empathize with some of the subconscious factors and if you can learn to do it, and if you're willing to do it, it's been to me the greatest discovery of my career, the cognitive revolution of 50 years ago when I was at Penn in the 70's and Ellis, Mack and others were just beginning to give birth to the cognitive model, that transformed the history of psychology and to some extent psychiatry. But I think we're now in the midst of a motivational revolution, and we're seeing that motivational factors have as powerful a role on how people think and feel as you know, distorted cognition or self-defeating beliefs or the things that cognitive therapists have been talking about for the last several decades. 

00:20:40
RICH SIMON So now, so in this example then, so in this case, this young man was, took the lead here in being to articulate these various objections that a part of him had to change. 

00:20:55
DAVID BURNS Right, mm-hmm. 

00:21:00
RICH SIMON But in a, perhaps is it more typical that the people are confused and they don't know how to get with it and you begin to articulate some of those for the 

00:21:05
DAVID BURNS Yea, that's right. The therapist's has got to take the lead. I did a workshop, an intensive last week at South San Fransisco Conference Center and what a joy that was. We, it was a small group, maybe 115 people but I did quite a bit of live work with participants and many of them had, had depression over different, different themes in their lives and one woman came up to the stage and she was, she was depressed because several people in her immediate family had malignancies and were facing death and loss, and I can't remember her negative thoughts on the daily mood log but on e of the themes that she had was that she should not be so upset and she felt that she had to keep this positive front up for her husband and her sister and the various people who were having these horrible medical problems and she had been unable to talk back to her negative thoughts. And I said can we just stop for a minute and talk about what all your suffering and negativity shows about you that's really kind of beautiful and awesome, and then together and with the help of the audience, we began to list you know, many things that it showed about her and it just had an almost magical effect. It was like afterwards, someone said it was like a young-ling thing, where there's a little bird pecking inside. The mother bird is pecking outside, and together, suddenly this little bird emerges, and that's suddenly like her whole personality changed, and the tears came, and then the joy came and she was really easy for her to crush her negative thoughts, and all. And she had been like 100 on the 0 to 100 scale for sadness and depression, and 100 on shame, and it just, they disappeared completely and it happened very, very quickly, it just, it took only a few minutes. But in the old days, I would have been working with her for weeks or months, trying to talk back to all these distorted self critical thoughts. 

00:23:30
RICH SIMON We're shifting out of that disputational role for the client and into this other mode and into this other, this other mode where you're an alliance with some force, and it helps and expansive quality within the client. 

00:23:45
DAVID BURNS Yea, it's like yin and yang, working through opposites simultaneously. On one hand, you're persuading the patient not to change and then on the other hand, we've got these 50 powerful techniques which will allow for sudden change. and putting those together, it seems to be you know one plus one is three or ten or something like that. It's just been very exciting for me to discover this and to share it with the colleagues in our training groups at Stanford and having colleagues who are able to learn it and see these amazing results in their clinical work. That's very heartwarming and exciting to me. 

00:24:20
RICH SIMON It sounds very exciting. Well, we'll get back to that, so for now, let's take the next step here. So this is a, in terms of it, this is the, this primes in a sense the process of the work you're doing these days. 

00:24:35
DAVID BURNS Yea, that's right. 

00:24:35
RICH SIMON This sets the agenda, this establishes a different kind of relationship between the client, and a different kind of relationship between the client and their symptoms, and why they're coming in and sounds lie it's very powerful. So for the moment let's, since we have a limited amount of time, then give us whatever the next in a first interview, this might take place, and would you, would that take most of the process that you just described, I'm sure there's a range and you're always, you keep emphasizing the importance of one size does not fit all and different people are different, but in a first interview, in addition to that kind of a, of an exchange with the client, what, what would you try to accomplish? 

00:25:15
DAVID BURNS Well 

00:25:20
RICH SIMON Anxiety client 

00:25:20
DAVID BURNS Well, with any client, I mean initially you've got to take a history and do the diagnosis, that's the part of therapy I like the least because I am eager to jump in and help the person change their life and yet I've always felt that I had a responsibility to do a good you know, comprehensive history. I think those aspects are perhaps not as interesting to your, to your viewers as once we get into the actual therapy, how the, how the new techniques might work. 

00:25:55
RICH SIMON Okay, so all right. So give us the flavor of that. So there's an initial, you're doing your first interview, you're gathering your information, you're getting a sense of the life context of the person, you're hearing their complaint, you're establishing your relationship with them, they're, you're establishing the conditions of the client's and these are, we're not going to emphasize that, but that's good therapy and that's, that's certainly, that goes for the kind of work. 

00:26:20
DAVID BURNS There is a little agenda setting that happens even in the first, the first interview when we're taking the history though. For example, I mentioned outcome resistance, but there's also something called process resistance. There is no magic button. And a patient with anxiety is going to have to do something that they don't want to do in order to be cured. A patient with depression is going to have to do something they don't want to do. There is no magic button in order to be cured, and so, we negotiate those things also, we negotiate at the very first interaction with the patient. For example, process resistance for depression has to do with doing psychotherapy homework. That's what the depressed patient is going to have to do that they're not going to want to do to get better. Exposure is what the anxious patient is going to have to do that they're not going to want to do in order to get better. And so I negotiate that with the patient. And again, it has to be done paradoxically. For example a young man came to me with crippling shyness. He was a handsome guy, he was about 31 years old, but he hadn't had a date in over ten years. How can a guy like this you know, be unable to get a date? Well, his problem was he sweated profusely and he had this great shame about his sweating and he would put on multiple deodorants and chemicals and pads in his armpits and chemicals on his face but still this is the summer in Philadelphia and he looked like a sprinkler system. 

00:27:55
RICH SIMON It's a losing battle, okay. 

00:28:00
DAVID BURNS Yea, and, and so he said is there any, is there any hope for me? I said so, would you like me to show you how to change your love life from rags to riches? And he said, oh I don't know if that would be possible but it would be wonderful, Dr. Burns, if you could do that. I said, oh yea, I could do that, but I don't know if you're willing to pay the price. He says, well isn't a hundred dollars an hour enough? What, what are you talking about? I said, well it's, it's not money. I would ask you to confront your fear, to do something that's going to freak you out. I might even ask you to do something called shame attacking exercises, do something bizarre in public to get, to get over your fear of making a fool of yourself. And if you're willing to do that, it's almost impossible for the treatment to fail. And if you're not willing to do that, it's almost impossible for the treatment to be successful. Well, I don't think he, and so, you see, so let me know if I accept you, would you be willing to do what I ask you to do? And we also call this sitting with open hands because if the patient says no I'm not ready to do that, then we say I can't accept you for treatment on this. Maybe we could work on something else. That's the paradox. Well, he bought it, but I don't think he was listening, and so I said next week we're going to have a 2 hour session and we're going to meet at 2. It's the hottest part of the, hottest time of the day, very humid, and we're going to go and do some shame attacking exercises. So he showed up early and you know, he has this fear that if any woman sees him sweating, she'll be all grossed out. So I said we're going to stop by the clinical lab of the hospital on the way out and grab some equipment that we'll need for our shame attacking exercises. So I got a squirt bottle that they used to clean out test tubes, filled it with water, so like, kind of like a squirt gun, and I said now we're going to jog to the 7-11. So we're jogging along, he doesn't know what's going to happen, he's kind of excited and we start sweating like crazy, both of us, and we get to the 7-11, and he says, well what now? And I said well, now here's what you're going to do. You're sweaty but not, you're not sweaty enough. So I'm going to sweat you, squirt your armpits so there's this big ring of moisture and I going to put water on your head so it looks like sweat is just pouring off you, like you've been in the shower. Then I want you to walk into the 7-11 and put your hand on the back of your head and then start pointing to your armpit and shout out loud, look at me, I'm sweating like a stuffed pig. It's so hot in Philadelphia this summer. Well he turned bright red and he said he wasn't about to do that, so no way, and I said wait a minute, you made a commitment. You would do whatever I asked, this is the price of recovery. This is what you have to do. We went back and forth, back and forth, finally he said well if you think it's so easy, I want to see you do it. I said no problem, so he squirted my armpits, poured water over my head 

00:31:05
RICH SIMON Good for you. 

00:31:10
DAVID BURNS I walked in, stood next to the cash register, started pointing at my armpits, saying you know, look at me, I'm sweating like a stuffed pig. It's so hot in Philadelphia this summer. 

00:31:20
RICH SIMON So no, I don't think Sigmund Freud would have approved of this intervention. 

00:31:25
DAVID BURNS Yea, yea, it's a little different. 

00:31:25
RICH SIMON Crazy to me, okay. 

00:31:25
DAVID BURNS Yea, absolutely. So people just ignored me. They got their slurp-ees and their hot dogs and this sort of thing and this fellow was watching me in amazement from the door and I went out and said now it's your turn. So now he can't get out of it. I poured water on his armpits and his head and he goes in and does his thing like starts shouting how sweaty he was, he's terrified. The only difference he was so handsome, everyone rushed up to him like a celebrity and said, oh do you, what kind of deodorant do you use, I sweat a lot too, what do you recommend type of thing. And he had great conversations with them. He couldn't believe that people weren't blown away by his, his sweatiness. So then we went from store to store taking turns going in, you know, doing our thing. And finally, we were in a little boutique and I saw this really good, they were selling women's sportswear and there was this really good looking young woman giving him the eye. He didn't notice. I said, you're last thing is go up and do your thing with her. This really freaked him out but he forced himself to do it. And got into this deep conversation with this young woman and finally she asked for his phone number. Or wait, she asked can I give you my phone number so maybe you can call me and we'll get together and you know, have a date or something. He went out of that 

00:32:55
RICH SIMON And discuss our choices of antiperspirants together. 

00:32:55
DAVID BURNS Exactly, so he went out of there on a cloud and it just, just you know imploded his whole anxiety system but I had to negotiate that up front. And that's again the thing that therapists tend not to do. They try to persuade the patient and then the patient starts resisting and that's the cause of all therapeutic failure. So at the very initial evaluation, I'm saying to the patient, here's what you'd have to do to change your life. If it's an addiction, if it's a relationship problem, if it's anxiety, and if it's depression, and if I agree to treat this for you, would you be willing to do that? And, and if not, the no problem, god bless you. I would hate to ask you to you know, confront your fears but by the same token, then I can't help you with it, with that problem. 

00:33:50
RICH SIMON Okay. All right. So it, so most, so by the end of a first session, typically for you, you've addressed these two aspects of resistance, outcome resistance and process resistance and in a sense, you've created a contract, an implicit contract for change that's different than what most of us do, and don't work in a, work in a non-paradoxical frame. 

00:34:15
DAVID BURNS Right, right. 

00:34:15
RICH SIMON All right. So once that is established, keep going with this. So give us a sense of what you do then. How do you setup your relationship and how do you decide the issue which you seem to emphasize over and over again, making sure that the methods that you're using are matching this particular client's needs as opposed to the one size fit all, fits all approach. 

00:34:40
DAVID BURNS Well, what I do is I fill out something called the daily mood log, and I have the patient fill it out as well, and I have them focus, say if it's anxiety on one moment that you're depressed, then what were you feeling then, how intense were the feelings and what were your negative thoughts? And then I take one of those negative thoughts and I put in the middle of what's called a recovery circle and then there's arrows coming out of this circle, and then I, with the help of the client, I select 15 or 20 techniques that we can use to challenge or crush that negative thought. And those techniques on the recovery circle, there'll be 10 or 12 cognitive techniques, 3 to 5 exposure techniques, plus the hidden emotion technique. And I find that by integrating those three different kinds of techniques, in most cases, can be a complete and rapid elimination of the symptoms. I would not want to use only exposure techniques. I would not want to use only cognitive techniques. I would not want to use only the hidden emotion technique or any other technique for that matter but integrate many techniques from many different schools of therapy. 

00:35:55
RICH SIMON Okay. So give us 

00:35:55
DAVID BURNS Give you an example of how that works if you want. 

00:35:55
RICH SIMON Yea, give us, exemplify that for us thank you. 

00:36:00
DAVID BURNS I'll give you, show you how the cognitive approach would work. A woman came to me after ten years of unsuccessful treatment for severe panic disorder associated with severe major depression. She'd had unsuccessful treatment with antidepressants, benzo's, all kinds of medicines. Essentially four or five times a week, she would have a overwhelming panic attack and she would think that she was about to die. She, typically what happened she'd get upset about something, gets upset with her children or something else. She doesn't notice that she gets upset, she begins hyperventilating and then her fingers get numb, her skin starts tingling, her chest gets tight, and she has to believe, I can't breathe, I'm going to have a heart attack. I'm about to die and, and she believes those thoughts 100% and that triggers massive panic. In fact, anyone watching this program, if you have the thought right now, you're about to die, you'd feel intense, intense panic. Now, one of the techniques on her recovery circle is called the experimental technique. And we're using the experimental technique now in an attempt to get a single session cure for panic disorder and for most patients, we're seeing that if we can sit down with them for one 2 hour session, we can pretty much complete the treatment for panic disorder in nearly all cases in on one session. You've got to take the history, you've got to do a little follow-up, but we get the job done pretty quickly, and I show a video of this, of her treatment actually in many of my workshops. I asked her for permission to induce a panic attack in the session cause I told her I wanted to show her a powerful technique to challenge her negative thoughts while the symptoms were full blown. She graciously allowed me to do this although she was terrified. I asked her to close her eyes and hyperventilate. And to indicate with her finger, wiggle her finger, when she's beginning to feel tightness in her chest, tingling in her skin. It took about 15 seconds and I said now I'm going to be that voice in your mind that gives you a panic attack. I want you to imagine that your windpipe is closing off. Imagine that you're about to have a heart attack ad sure enough this triggered a massive panic attack. You can see this in the video, and she's sobbing really severely, and begging me to stop, saying Dr. Burns, I can't go on. Please this is horrible, I know I'm about to die. Now a decision point for the therapist generally when patients are overwhelmed with emotion, we back off and empathize and when I show the video I say to the therapists, ask yourself what you would have done if you were the therapist, here's this woman sobbing, begging you to stop Would you come back often, what would have been the implications? I ask her, I said Terry, I want you to you know, stick with this because we have a chance right now to beat this devil that's been plaguing you for the past ten years and I have a question for you. If you were having a heart attack right now, do you think you're about to have a heart attack, what's one thing you wouldn't be able to do? And she said I don't know, and then she was just kind of babbling and you know, totally gone out of control and sobbing. And I said do you think if you were having a heart attack right now, you could stand up and do strenuous aerobic exercises? And she said no, I know if I stand I'll pass out. And so I said, well, then I'm going to show you the experimental technique, let's do an experiment and test that. Stand up and let's see if you pass out. Of course I know she can't possibly pass out physically because her heart is beating, her blood pressure's up, and so that, that's not going to happen. So she stood up, then she says I feel ridiculous, and so I said let's see if you can do some running in place. Maybe you have to feel ridiculous to beat this thing. So she starts running in place real slow like, and so I said come on now, let's push harder. I said this is the Olympics, we've got to bring on this heart attack. So she starts going faster and I said so how much do you believe you can't breathe deeply enough? Cause that had been 100%. And she said oh it's down to 70. And she said I'm too tired to go on. I said well, jog a little faster then. And so she starts jogging faster and talking and keeps trying to persuade me to stop, and then she stops and she says I just, I can't go any further, just too tired, I know I'm about to die. I said well do some jumping jacks then, so she starts doing some jumping jacks and you see her on the video, you see her say I wonder if I could do this if I was having a heart attack. And I said is this what you see in the emergency rooms of hospitals, patients with massive heart attacks standing next to their gurneys doing jumping jacks? And at that point she doubled over with laughter, and you see her, her face changing in a flash from this horrible misery to laughter and then she stood up again, continued with the jumping jacks, I said keep it up. I'm sure you'll pass out at any moment. And then she doubled over with laughter again, and she says I feel a lot better and she sat down and that was actually the moment of her recovery. And it's interesting for therapists to see this because it took six minutes to complete her treatment, and yet she had had ten years of unsuccessful conventional therapy, pill therapy before that. There was a little bit more too it, so she would see what was happening. I induced another panic attack, she got just as panicky. Once again, she was afraid she was going to die. I said, you think you could do some jumping jacks right now, she says no, if I stand up, I know I'm going to pass out. I said let's check it out, stand up, do some jumping jacks, and then 30 seconds into the jumping jacks she said, she started laughing again. She said that this is ridiculous. So that's called the experimental technique. It's just one of 50 techniques. 

00:43:10
RICH SIMON And the experimental aspect is you're directly challenging someone to do something that gives the lie, challenges their belief about what will happen if they do that thing. 

00:43:20
DAVID BURNS Yes, and in a sense you could say the shame attacking exercise that the other young man did, who thought that people would be disgusted by his sweating, was also an experimental technique, doing an experiment to test the validity of what you're thinking. And it's a lot like exposure but it's more powerful than exposure because they're testing a negative thought at the same time they're confronting their fears. 

00:43:45
RICH SIMON Yea, yea. 

00:43:45
DAVID BURNS And one other quick, quick think. Just to mention, empathy is important. We measure empathy after every single therapy session and I could not 

00:43:55
RICH SIMON And it's so crucial because that's the element here is that people are going out there and if they, if you haven't established, I mean it's quite a credit to whatever connection you're making with both of these clients, so this is the part that we're not making as a explicit as the technical aspect. 

00:44:10
DAVID BURNS Yea, you can't just attack people with these powerful techniques, because again, not only will they resist but it's going to seem insensitive. You've got to go with the patient to the gates of Hell and they've got a lot, in order to be cured, and they've got to have a lot of warmth and feel a lot of warmth and trust in order to make that kind of commitment. 

00:44:30
RICH SIMON Yea, now this is, one of the things that I've noticed is the various ways in which our traditional notions of who a therapist is and what a therapist does and doesn't do have shifted and teased you a moment ago with your non-Freudian approach with the fellow who was like Albert Brooks in Broadcast News, so now is, it sound, this is much more like the role of what I identify at least as a coach. That is the coach who challenges you, as a therapist who you know soothes you and is very concerned with creating a safe and nurturing environment for you. Does that term, does coaching have some resonance for you? I know some therapists have a negative association with that. They don't want that in any way associated with what they do. How do you think about your role as a therapist and its relationship to being, moving outside the tradition parameters of what we have thought of at least as being a therapist? 

00:45:40
DAVID BURNS Well, I'm not an expert in coaching but there are so many professions now that have gotten involved in therapy but I see the same error in psychiatrists, psychologists, coaches, clinical social workers, this urge to jump in and help without really, without really setting the agenda. So I wouldn't say it's coaching because that would be assuming that coaches don't make this, the same error that therapists make and I, I'm certain they do. 

00:46:10
RICH SIMON Yea, that's interesting. So it does seem like you, this first crucial step before rushing in is do we want to rush in? What's the goal here? Am I going to wind up in a tug of war to this person about changing something that they really don't want to change? So you're establishing a really collaborative alliance by voicing the aspect, the part of that person who may not be in the least bit invested in changing what they appear to want to change. 

00:46:40
DAVID BURNS That's right, and once you really become that part of their mind, then they suddenly want to change and then you've got a powerful teamwork, like you and I have a little bit of a teamwork and probably talking too much, it's the first time we've worked together. When we talked on the phone, I really liked you and thought wow, this guy's really got it together and so as we work together with good will we could probably accomplish a lot in many different arenas and it's the same thing. If you and the patient are working together, there's almost nothing that can stop you. If you haven't taken the resistance into account and melted away the resistance at the front end, then the therapy is going to be much slower. 

00:47:25
RICH SIMON And the other thing that you, once that's done and you're developing this alliance that brings some of the factors that may in the way, these unexpressed or subconscious factors, to the surface, the next thing you're talking about is getting highly concr-, you start off in a very concrete way where here give me an example of what you want to change and then everything that you're describing, your choice of methods, your interventions, follow not from a generalized description but a very specific description, that instant 

00:47:55
DAVID BURNS I love what you're saying and that, that I think is so important. It's kind of a Buddhist idea, I think the Buddha said you can only change at one second of your life. And it takes many reincarnations to do that. If you can change for one second, you would experience enlightenment, and not only would you become enlightened, the whole universe would become enlightened because the whole universe is one. And you hear that and it sounds like a lot of bullshit or something, and yet that's exactly how we're doing therapy and you saw it in fact, you can ask the question did Terry recover, or did Terry experience enlightenment? And the Buddhists actually have the one doing the jumping jacks, the Buddhists have a concept called laughing enlightenment, where you break into uncontrollable laughter at the moment of enlightenment. That's kind of what, what happened to her, and if I can help the patient change one moment of their lives, then in most cases, all the other problems fall apart like a house of cards. So I'm saying give me one moment you were upset, what were you thinking and feeling at that moment, what was going on, and then give me just one of those thoughts that, one of the negative thoughts, and then we'll bring this all this fire power to bear. And I call this the hourglass effect, you see at the top of the therapy, at the beginning, it's the top of the hourglass. The patient's all these problems, they're used to ruminating with therapists about their life, their childhood, all the things that are wrong and we've gone and narrowed that down to just one of those problems and just one moment in your life, and just one thought at that moment. But if you'll let me change you for one moment of your life, then at the bottom of the hourglass, suddenly on the other side, all the other problems generally, generally fall apart. So the dividends, the dividends are huge. 

00:49:45
RICH SIMON So yea, there's kind of a nexus. so its not as if rather than this almost impossibly complicated task where there's so many beliefs, so many circumstances in somebody's lives that are disturbing, we have to just take them one by one. You're experience is that they're the leverage point, the success, the success experience with something that's deeply distressing becomes a leverage point in a dramatic way. 

00:50:20
DAVID BURNS Yes, yes in my experience, and other therapists experience it differently, and of course every client you work with is a little different, but most of the time, the recovery hits like lightning. There's an ah-hah experience and there's a total body change. The whole brain changes at that point and then the patient sees everything differently. In the early days of cognitive therapy, we used to call that the cognitive click. Buddha called it enlightenment. You can call it whatever you want. But the other thing the patient has to know is once they've become enlightened and experienced this unbelievable joy, I mean after that session, Terry was, her joy was just, just boundless, it's like being born again, and the nice thing it touches the therapist too. You can't give that to a patient without experiencing it yourself at the same time, but you have to tell the patient the good news is this is the happiest you've ever felt and you're now cured and it took us six minutes. Even better news is you're going to relapse for the rest of your life, and that's even better news because that's going to, the second when you relapse and overcome it, that's the difference between feeling better and getting better and you'll have the tool that you can use for the rest of your life. No one's entitled to being happy all the time. We all fall back into these holes, so you have to do a little relapse prevention after you've had this dramatic change. The relapse 

00:51:50
RICH SIMON So tell us about that, What is that you, how do, tell us about the relapse prevention, so with Terry for example, very, you had this wonderful session and you've been through, you celebrate with this woman and you 

00:52:00
DAVID BURNS Well there's a couple, there are several aspects to relapse prevention training and it takes about 20-25 minutes to complete the job. One part of it is to tell the patient that for the rest of your life, you know, we might have had to try 10 or 12 techniques from my list of 50, before we find the one that really cracks it open for a patient, but the neat thing is once you've found a technique for a patient, it will work for them for the rest of their life, and they've got to know that. The second thing they've got to know that they're going to relapse because otherwise especially if they're depressed, and they go into this euphoric state for three weeks and then the depression comes back three weeks later, they may feel so hopeless that they commit suicide, because they all have the same thoughts of relapse. My recovery was just a fluke, I was fooling myself, I'm hopeless after all. And I actually practice a technique called externalization of voices, where I become that part of their mind, and I verbally attack them like that, with their permission of course. We write down the thoughts, here's the thoughts you're going to have when you relapse, now I'm going to be that part of your mind. And I start saying to them, oh wow, you were happy for three weeks, now you've relapsed. That recovery was just a fluke. The therapy didn't work. And see if they can crush me when I do that. And if they don't I do a role reversal, and we do role reversals back and forth until they can absolutely crush those thoughts and then I know they're ready for discharge. But I tell them I've never discharged a patient, never will, you're my patient for life. But if I don't hear from you, I'll assume that no news is good news. I hope you will relapse because I really like you, and now I just got to know you, and now you had to go and recover on me. And if you relapse, it will be my only chance to see you again. In my career 

00:54:05
RICH SIMON You're a pretty paradoxical fellow, David. 

00:54:05
DAVID BURNS Yea, I've had less than 12 patients who've relapsed in my career and I've had over 35,000 therapy sessions with severely depressed and severely anxious individuals. 

00:54:20
RICH SIMON When you say that though what do you mean? You're saying there's the inevitability of relapse so you have a depressed client 

00:54:25
DAVID BURNS I prepare them for it so they know you know, we all get upset and they, they just never called to come back. Maybe it's because they didn't like me, my techniques weren't any good, but I would hope the relapse prevention was a part of it, and those who did come back for relapse all but one of them was all but one or two sessions. Now take Terry, I didn't hear from her, you know we had a couple more sessions, pulled things together, did a little relapse prevention, there's a few other bells and whistles we probably won't have time to mention today. They had an emotional ones there's another awesome one we didn't get to, but I got a call from her about 8 years later, and I was, I had my little you know, emergency thing I would carry on call, and I was doing a workshop in Atlanta, Georgia and I was showing her video in the workshop, and I got a call, Dr. Burns I'm having a panic attack. It's the first one she'd had in 8 years, and I thought my gosh, I'm such a fraud, I'm showing this video and now she's relapsed. But I called her at the break and I said listen, do your jumping jacks and I'll be home tonight. We'll have an emergency session tomorrow, and I'll call you at the end of the workshop tonight at 4:30. So she said fine. So I called her back at 4:30 and she said I don't need the session tomorrow, I did my jumping jacks. Same thing happened. And I've had to call her every year or two to say can I keep showing the video, you know from an ethics point of view, do I still have your permission. And she always says tell your audiences, I'm still on a high. That was 1988. Ans she said I had that one panic attack during that time and that was that. 

00:56:10
RICH SIMON All right, well we just have a few minutes here, so let's, I'm sure many people who are watching will be interested in finding out more about your work and things they can read, and perhaps more to the point, training opportunities, so where do they go? 

00:56:30
DAVID BURNS Well, there's a few things, you know. My books, Feeling Good and Feeling Good handbook, as well as When Panic Attacks, they can get in any book store and those are written for the lay person, but therapists say they get a good benefit from them too. If you go to my website, which is a crappy website, I apologize, but it does list my workshops. www.feelinggood.com or another resource, I have a new psychotherapy ebook, and if you'd like an order form for that, it shows how to use the new what we call TEAM therapy, T-E-A-M, testing, empathy, agenda setting, and all 50 techniques, send me an email to david@feelinggood.com and I'll send you an order form for the new psychotherapy ebook which is called Tools Not Schools of Therapy. 

00:57:25
RICH SIMON Yea, okay, wonderful. And the last thing is as throughout this series, we really want to invite the comments of people who are watching the session, listening to this session, so there's a comment board below your screen. And that will enable you to carry forward the conversation that David has begun by introducing us to his work. 

00:57:50
DAVID BURNS I can see one of the comments, Rich. What does it say, Dr. Burns sucks. 

00:57:55
RICH SIMON Let's dispute that. Start doing some jumping jacks there. We'll cure you of that one. That, it happens occasionally. I don't there will be too many after this interview. In any case, please we invite you when your, what are your thoughts? Most importantly, put into language what you learned, what stood out for you about David's comments today. What does that do, how does that add some new sense of possibility, how does it shake up your therapeutic world, whatever it is. Please share it with us. It's good for you. It's also good for the rest of us, begins a group conversation. With each of these, one of the really interesting things is to see the varied responses people offer. David will, does not guarantee he will respond to any of these, but I'm sure he'll be grateful 

00:58:40
DAVID BURNS You'll forward them to me? 

00:58:45
RICH SIMON Uh, yes, I'll make sure that you get a chance to get in and you're a very engaged trainer. So you may well get a response from the, Dr. Dave himself. In any case, we'll invite you to share with the rest of us your reactions to this interview. David, we're out of time. What a engaging conversation, really appreciate you spending the time with us. Thank you so much. 

00:59:10
DAVID BURNS Thanks. It's been an honor to work with you Rich, I really appreciate it. 

00:59:15
RICH SIMON Take care. Well, that's, we're launched here on our Treating Anxiety webcast. See you again next time. Bye bye.
