00:00:50
SONYA PERDUTA Mike' and Joe's friend Miller Chat Hi, welcome to Miller Chat. Ah... First of all I like to thank Robbin Miller for her production and directorial assistance today. But hello to everybody out there. Ah... During today's show Joe Bellil, Mike Kennedy and I will be frankly discussing the perceptions, stereotypes and mythology about persons with disabilities. Myself, I thought we should start by defining those three terms. And what I did was I took them out of the dictionary, I'm just going to read 'em to you. It's taken out of the Merriam-Webster Collegiate ah... dictionary, that's the number 10. I think it was the tenth edition. But the three things we're gonna talk about are perceptions, stereotypes and mythology. Perceptions are the result of an observation or mental image. A stereotype is something conforming to a fixed or general pattern. Especially, a standardized mental picture that is held in common by members of a certain group and usually it represents an oversimplified opinion, a prejudice(ph) attitude or an uncritical judgment. An uncritical judgment, pretty much meaning that no real intellectuals thought or scrutiny went to why that stereotype is present, it's just, everybody just says it because it's there. Ah... Mythology itself is a popular belief or tradition that has grown up around something or someone, especially something embodying the ideals and institutions of a society or segment of society. So, you can see when we talk about these three terms that a perception is a combination of what we physically see with our eyes and what our memories, experiences and education tells us is the meaning of what we see. Ah... Stereotypes of mythology are usually widely held beliefs attached to certain types of people that lack intellectual foundation in a commonly based upon a single or a few emotion-laden experiences. Stereotypes tend to be based on negativity while mythology tends to be overly positive in grandiose. I just have a few examples ah... before we really start discussing. One of them is, a common perception of people with disabilities is that they do not go out in public. This is most likely based on the fact that large numbers of people with disabilities are not seen out and about, out and about the cities and towns within which they live. Okay. Ah... But the reality of that is, is there is a lack of access or people with disabilities cannot get out and they cannot ah... move around in their own environments. So, that's a perception there, people with disabilities don't go out and it's really not true. A common stereotype is that people with disabilities are asexual, that they have no sexual feelings or no sexual thoughts. This is an American societal stereotype mostly based on I think on a lack of visual validation of sexuality(ph) because people with disabilities don't get out in public. So, therefore, you never see two people together, one who maybe disabled or both of 'em maybe disabled who are in love and obviously having a romantic relationship, people don't see that. So, they assume that nobody with disabilities are sexual. Ah... A common myth about people with disabilities is this whole supercrip phenomenon. Ah... Supercrip meaning, you know, like superman but he's a super person with a disability. Ah... And that phenomenon is that that many people with disabilities can perform above and beyond and do wondrous things ah... even do great feats even though they have their disabilities. And it's true, a lot of people with disabilities do do great feats ah... for instance there was a recent blind climber who actually scaled Mount Everest. Now, that is a great feet. And that would be kind of supercrip phenomenon, but not everybody is like that. But (inaudible ) with this phenomenon is associated with everyday types of activities which is normal to everybody else, but with people with disabilities, ah... society might look at that as something that is wondrous and great just because you can reach for a canopies off a counter in a, in a grocery store. So, that's that supercrip phenomenon, that's what a myth is. So, we have what a perception is, what a stereotype is and what a... what the mythology is of people with disabilities, those examples. But now, Joe, Joe Bellil here and Mike and I will openly discuss what these perception, stereotypes and myths are associated with people with disabilities. How're you guys doing today? 

00:05:20
JOE BELLIL Oh, I am doing great! 

00:05:20
MIKE KENNEDY I am doing great too. I am doing super actually. 

00:05:25
JOE BELLIL Good! 

00:05:25
SONYA PERDUTA Just like a supercrip. 

00:05:25
MIKE KENNEDY Yes. 

00:05:25
SONYA PERDUTA So, ah... tell me what do you guys think of, of myths and perceptions or misperceptions. 

00:05:30
JOE BELLIL I like the supercrip deal. 

00:05:30
MIKE KENNEDY Yeah. 

00:05:35
JOE BELLIL I think that was kind of interesting although, I was bumming that super-class Spiderman is not in a wheelchair. 

00:05:35
SONYA PERDUTA Hahaha... 

00:05:40
JOE BELLIL Wouldn't that be great! 

00:05:40
MIKE KENNEDY Oh! 

00:05:40
JOE BELLIL I mean, having nice action hero in a wheelchair using that. 

00:05:40
MIKE KENNEDY Great, as long as he has a restrictive(ph) device to, you know, keep the chair attached by his side, you know, you know climbing up the, you know up the webbing. 

00:05:50
JOE BELLIL Oh, exactly, of course, nearby. 

00:05:50
MIKE KENNEDY But... Hahaha... But, no it's funny with talking about the, you know supercrips and ah... like say I mean, I've been there in a wheelchair for ah... 28 years now and I've actually played a lot of sports and one of 'em happens to be ah... basketball. And ah... I've probably attended, you know three or four of 'em, you know final fours of, you know the in, you know National Wheelchair Basketball Association games. And frankly there are ah... some incredible athletes out there playing basketball but, ah... you know someone like myself... 

00:06:25
Miller Chat 

00:06:25
MIKE KENNEDY ...I've been playing wheelchair basketball good 25 years and, and I can honestly say that if you see me play you are not gonna mistake me for a supercrip. Hahaha... 

00:06:35
SONYA PERDUTA (Inaudible ) the whole supercrip does that make ah... I guess people in wheelchair, who use wheelchairs that play basketball, does that make 'em any more athletic than someone who is able bodied and plays basketball. It doesn't make them super more or less, it just makes them athletic, right? Yeah. 

00:06:50
MIKE KENNEDY Right. It... You know because whether you're playing basketball from a, you know in a wheelchair, or you know less standing it, it will be quite as great the strength and ability. 

00:07:00
SONYA PERDUTA Right. 

00:07:00
MIKE KENNEDY And... But, you know what, you know when it comes to playing sports, where we're just like continue talking about basketball, you hate, hmm... Excuse me, you have the real good players in happy steps and me, I, I've been working hard just to stay mediocre. Hahaha... 

00:07:15
JOE BELLIL Hahaha... 

00:07:20
SONYA PERDUTA So, that the supercrip, what are their perceptions or stereotypes are they associated with people with disabilities that are untrue. 

00:07:25
JOE BELLIL Well I like the one brought up, about people not getting out enough and the access issues that are probably the main item on that. 

00:07:30
SONYA PERDUTA Hmm... 

00:07:30
JOE BELLIL Especially, if you look at some of the buildings, somebody says, well, I never see a person with a disability up here or somebody in a wheelchair or maybe it's, it's not accessible. I have heard that many times. 

00:07:40
SONYA PERDUTA What do you mean by that when you say it's not accessible, what, what (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:07:45
JOE BELLIL Mile's and Sonya's friend Miller Chat Ah... There could be steps, there could be a couple of steps. Now a couple of steps is a big barrier for, for most folks that use wheelchairs, and but other people may not see that, because they may say, well they can be hoisted up or lifted up there, but no, it's, it takes away a lot of the independence and, and people don't feel comfortable, I don't feel comfortable while going places where I have to be bumped up a step or whatever for, whatever issues, especially with safety issues. You know, I don't like another person helping me up, I'd rather do it myself and also there was ever some emergency where you needed to get out, I don't wanna worry about being, you know having to deal with a step or that is it. 

00:08:15
SONYA PERDUTA Being stuck there and dealing with some (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:08:20
JOE BELLIL Sure. So, I imagine lot of people wouldn't frequent ah... places that were inaccessible. 

00:08:25
SONYA PERDUTA I know, I don't frequent places that are inaccessible, maybe because I am really fervently independent I guess, as well as same facts. I prefer to move around and be independent, show people that I, that I am independent. 

00:08:35
JOE BELLIL Hmm... Hmm... 

00:08:35
SONYA PERDUTA And I think that mainly comes from the fact that when I was ah... not involved with anybody, I wanted to portray ah... to be an independent woman and kind of ah... prevent the stereotype of being dependent and needing someone to take care of me. I guess, I wanted to show people that I could take care of myself so that if someone might be romantically interested in me, they wouldn't think they had to like take care of me and do everything for me. I don't know, you guys ever feel that way or... 

00:09:05
MIKE KENNEDY Well, I mean, the way... you know about you were talking about the couple of steps, I mean, whether it's one step, two steps and as will be, you know six flights of stairs, and for me it's just a, just a simple as this. I wanna be able to come and go as I please. 

00:09:15
SONYA PERDUTA Exactly. 

00:09:15
JOE BELLIL Hmm... 

00:09:15
MIKE KENNEDY If... If it's a club, it's a night club and ah... the bands ah... big disappointment. 

00:09:25
SONYA PERDUTA You wanna go? 

00:09:25
MIKE KENNEDY I want to leave. 

00:09:25
SONYA PERDUTA Right! 

00:09:25
JOE BELLIL Right! 

00:09:25
MIKE KENNEDY And I don’t have to worry about, you know trying to find a couple of bounces to, ah... you know get me in and out of the place. 

00:09:30
JOE BELLIL Also, you hope that the, the bathroom is accessible, you know, the restroom is accessible and... 

00:09:35
MIKE KENNEDY Good point. 

00:09:35
JOE BELLIL ...(inaudible ) you're about for a few hours. 

00:09:37
MIKE KENNEDY Great, great especially a (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:09:40
JOE BELLIL If it isn't, then that's another reason why not to go to the club. 

00:09:40
MIKE KENNEDY Right! 

00:09:40
SONYA PERDUTA Right! 

00:09:40
JOE BELLIL I'm sorry I need to go outside, I mean, I have to go outside because the bathroom is not accessible. I mean... 

00:09:45
MIKE KENNEDY Sonya's and Joe's friend Miller Chat Right, which is... 

00:09:45
JOE BELLIL There are a lot of different factors. 

00:09:45
MIKE KENNEDY Yes. 

00:09:50
SONYA PERDUTA Unacceptable, totally unacceptable. 

00:09:50
JOE BELLIL Oh exactly, yeah. 

00:09:50
SONYA PERDUTA Right. 

00:09:50
JOE BELLIL Yeah. 

00:09:50
SONYA PERDUTA Exactly. They wouldn't expect someone else to do that, but they would think it's okay of us to do that, you know it's kind of interesting. But what are the other stereotypes? What about the one about that we are ignorant? I mean, that's a real major one there. All people with disabilities are pretty brain dead or brainless or don't have the capacity to speak well or speak for themselves even. What do you... What do you think about that? 

00:10:10
JOE BELLIL It's like having, if you're, if you are using a chair, you may have an additional disability automatically. You know assigned to you, you know whether it's intellectually or whatever, right. I mean, we're all people and we all have different levels of education and... 

00:10:25
MIKE KENNEDY Right. 

00:10:25
JOE BELLIL ...and things like that and people I think, tend to look at somebody and say okay well, if they are in a chair then they must, they must not be that right, because they're, they are in a chair or they must have other disabilities going on. I think the same thing is if somebody who is visually impaired for example, if somebody starts yelling at that individual, I think it's, it's the same way... they're not, they can hear, they are just visually impaired. So, they assume other disabilities. That's not right. 

00:10:50
Miller Chat 

00:10:50
SONYA PERDUTA I know people have assumed I've been deaf as well as (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:10:55
MIKE KENNEDY Right. I was just gonna say that, Joe (crosstalk)(inaudible). Well, yeah. If they are like talking to you when all of a suddenly they're talking to you a little louder and ah... 

00:11:05
SONYA PERDUTA Slower... 

00:11:05
JOE BELLIL Yeah. 

00:11:05
MIKE KENNEDY You know a, a, a, and slower and its funny they start getting that closer to you to the point that they are like starting to get really closer the person who (crosstalk)(inaudible). And speaking really loud and howl. Hahaha... I mean, it's like a, you know being in a front row, you know concert or something like that so, you know just tone it down a little bit. Hahaha... But, yeah, I mean, and I think another you know part of this you know ignorant or right not pride is they maybe they assume that because you don't get out much, maybe you don't have the same social skills as they might have because you know they do get out and about... 

00:11:40
JOE BELLIL Hmm... 

00:11:40
SONYA PERDUTA Hmm... 

00:11:45
JOE BELLIL And also lot of times you don't feel welcome and I also just speak for so many that uses, that uses a wheelchair. As you're saying we were talking about night clubs and feeling that you want, when you want to leave, you want to leave and you don't want to be restricted in that way. 

00:11:55
MIKE KENNEDY Right! 

00:11:55
JOE BELLIL But a lot of times places aren't that friendly, I mean sometimes, and then, I think it hits a lot of different perceptions. First of it, if you go to a place and, and you, the counters are really high. 

00:12:05
SONYA PERDUTA Hmm... 

00:12:05
JOE BELLIL And... And then it's a hustle to get a drink or to order your food or whatever else. And then you have to worry about getting, keep going through the isles, if the isles aren't 36 inches wide and you have difficulty going through and you have to make sure people move out of your way. Again that's another, it just reasons for not to go to that location. 

00:12:25
SONYA PERDUTA Fine, trapped(ph). 

00:12:25
JOE BELLIL And you see a lot of that. And I think a lot of it is ignorance by the public. I mean, it's just, you know, if people were more understanding about accessibility and about, the need to make sure the things are more open and, and people, listen to people disabilities more. I think it'll be a lot easier. You'll see more people involved, buying goods, being more involved in the society. But it's not just come a long way but it still needs to go a long way. I mean, we have, I mean, public buildings there is some of 'em are still inaccessible and lot of private buildings are inaccessible and ADA has done some good, but you need to, in order to really change it if somebody is not fore changing it, you need to file a suit. 

00:13:05
SONYA PERDUTA Right! 

00:13:05
JOE BELLIL And that's again more work and it's you got more people who wouldn't just realize that, as the population gets older and it's also the right thing they do is to make things as accessible as possible on all of us, not just wheelchair access. 

00:13:20
MIKE KENNEDY Right. That makes sense to me, you know, you talk about, you know some of the buildings that aren't very friendly, I mean, you know, it's really annoying is that a building might actually start up with a great potential to be friendly, then you know we are, you know the isles, 3 maybe even 4 feet wide then you start to cluttering them up with, you know these, you know what you call it's ah... 

00:13:45
SONYA PERDUTA Displays! (Crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:13:45
MIKE KENNEDY Sonya's and Joe's friend Miller Chat Yeah, these displays of the same merchandise that's upon the shelves anyways. I mean, what, what's the point. 

00:13:50
SONYA PERDUTA Right. So that it make places unwelcome for us, so it makes us feel that people don't want us in their establishment so they are not thinking about satisfying our needs as consumers in, in purchasing their products, to speak right. 

00:14:05
MIKE KENNEDY Right. 

00:14:05
SONYA PERDUTA You... You brought up a good point Joe, when you said that they don't listen to us. Where do you think that they don't listen to us comes from? Do that... They don't listen to us because they, they think we don't know, we are talking about or we don't, shouldn't be listened to because we are not, our opinions are as important or either, I mean is this valid or... What do you... Where do you think that comes from? Because that is, would be another misperception or myth or something, but... 

00:14:30
JOE BELLIL I think it's again I mentioned the word ignorance. I think people sometimes don't, if they, if they are not really open and wanting to get people with disabilities to enter their facilities... 

00:14:40
SONYA PERDUTA Hmm... Hmm... 

00:14:40
JOE BELLIL ...then they're gonna be less likely to worry to want to know things that would make it easier. Like I mentioned counters, I mentioned having those steps or ramp, also the way you talk to somebody. If you're going to a different facility, for example I know this maybe another perception is that when you, when you meet somebody with a disability, sometimes people don't shake your hand. 

00:15:00
SONYA PERDUTA Right, yes. 

00:15:05
JOE BELLIL And... 

00:15:05
SONYA PERDUTA Why is that you think? 

00:15:05
JOE BELLIL Because maybe they're sacred that we may not be able to shake hands or, or... 

00:15:10
SONYA PERDUTA That we're contagious maybe! 

00:15:10
JOE BELLIL We're contagious, so... 

00:15:15
SONYA PERDUTA I thought, I found that a lot. I mean, I remember (inaudible ) ever been in a elevator, we get in an elevator and that will send everyone behind you just kind of moves closer to the wall and away from you like you have some disease and it's emanating from you or something. 

00:15:25
JOE BELLIL Hahaha... 

00:15:25
SONYA PERDUTA So, you don't know how many times, I want to just up to grab and then touch 'em and then we've got it now, you know, something like that. 

00:15:30
MIKE KENNEDY You're raped! 

00:15:30
SONYA PERDUTA Yeah something like that, but because you can feel them withdraw. I don't know, and you can just see and you can actually physically see them back away from you, so, so those are, it's true, it's weird (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:15:40
MIKE KENNEDY But, I mean that when you can fun, I mean, so what you do is especially if it's say a long elevator right up, you know maybe if you have to go to the 21st floor or something, you start kind of inching closer and closer to 'em, and you know see 'em back up against the wall like oh... 

00:15:55
SONYA PERDUTA Hahaha... Right you can feel and do that. 

00:15:55
MIKE KENNEDY Yeah. 

00:15:55
JOE BELLIL Well. 

00:16:00
SONYA PERDUTA Good. So you said contagious like they would get it, and I am sorry what was the other thing you said before that it's, it's slipped out of my mind, but... 

00:16:05
JOE BELLIL I mean, just like shaking your hand. 

00:16:05
SONYA PERDUTA Oh yeah, they think you can't shake your hand... 

00:16:05
MIKE KENNEDY Right! 

00:16:10
SONYA PERDUTA because they don't know what your disability is and whether you can move that part of your body... 

00:16:10
MIKE KENNEDY Exactly. 

00:16:10
SONYA PERDUTA ...and yeah, they don't know whether to lean into you or what to do, yeah. 

00:16:15
MIKE KENNEDY Proceed with caution. 

00:16:15
SONYA PERDUTA Yeah. 

00:16:15
MIKE KENNEDY Yeah, like approach with caution or something like that. 

00:16:20
SONYA PERDUTA Hmm... Hmm... 

00:16:20
JOE BELLIL Anyhow, we, we've come across lot of folks with very different disabilities, I mean all, all three are all paraplegic, so we have the use of our hands and things. 

00:16:25
SONYA PERDUTA Hmm... Hmm... 

00:16:30
JOE BELLIL Other people may have some deformities. And... But the main thing is if, when you meet somebody you treat the person as you would with anybody else. 

00:16:35
SONYA PERDUTA Right! 

00:16:35
JOE BELLIL If you normally shake the person's hand... 

00:16:35
SONYA PERDUTA We shake hands. 

00:16:35
JOE BELLIL You know, you know put your hand out, and, but the person, you know generally the person will shake your hand... 

00:16:40
SONYA PERDUTA Hmm... Hmm... 

00:16:45
JOE BELLIL ...and no matter what... 

00:16:45
SONYA PERDUTA They won't say I can't. 

00:16:45
JOE BELLIL Oh sure. So it's like... 

00:16:45
SONYA PERDUTA Yeah, right, exactly. 

00:16:45
JOE BELLIL Yeah, exactly or they may grab it with the other hand because... 

00:16:50
SONYA PERDUTA Yeah. 

00:16:50
JOE BELLIL ...they are not able to use that hand. But that's, you know just again you wanna treat the person with the same respect you would treat anybody else. 

00:16:55
SONYA PERDUTA Right. 

00:16:55
JOE BELLIL That's the case but, again all these, all these perceptions, wrong perceptions, really limit, I mean will hinder people with disabilities to venture more out into the, into the public or into the certain, you know places that aren't as friendly. 

00:17:10
SONYA PERDUTA Hmm... Hmm... 

00:17:10
JOE BELLIL And when you, and this is needed to be changed. 

00:17:15
Miller Chat 

00:17:15
SONYA PERDUTA I agree, I agree. So, what you think about my, my use of the stereotype as asexual? Do you think that is a pretty common rampant kind of concept out there in an able-bodied world or, or the, the tab world as we could call it, the temporarily able-bodied, but what do you think? 

00:17:30
MIKE KENNEDY It's a good question. It, you know, you know, because myself, I'm, you know married, so I don't really think about it as much, but you know, when I was out there, you know a long time ago in that dating scene, it just, you know wondered why that, you know some people thought and I know, I mean I think it all depends on the person themselves. I mean, you know I was definitely, you know shy, later bloomer type of guy. So, but, I don't know that's, I have a less to say on that one. 

00:18:05
JOE BELLIL I am going to say the same thing. I mean, again people are, people of disabilities are people, people first then and by, I could tell you so many different stories but people with disabilities are very sexual, as sexual as anybody else. 

00:18:15
SONYA PERDUTA Well that's pretty much what I wanted to just say, I mean... 

00:18:20
JOE BELLIL Oh, oh, sure it is. Oh, yeah. 

00:18:20
SONYA PERDUTA ...I'm just bringing this out because that's what written in all the books, that's what you read. So, you, you both agree that people with, with disabilities are sexual that it is a stereotype that needs to be broken down or removed as a barrier that all people with disabilities are sexual, want to have sexual relationships and, and, and basically enjoy sexuality, right? 

00:18:40
JOE BELLIL Oh sure. 

00:18:40
SONYA PERDUTA Yeah. 

00:18:40
JOE BELLIL And, and but the perception of, of maybe some people is that, because we have some sort of disability or some sort of limitation, physical limitation that we are not sexual because of that... 

00:18:50
SONYA PERDUTA Right. 

00:18:50
JOE BELLIL ...and that's completely wrong. 

00:18:50
SONYA PERDUTA Though it's false, exactly. 

00:18:55
JOE BELLIL Oh sure. 

00:18:55
SONYA PERDUTA Yeah. 

00:18:55
MIKE KENNEDY No doubt about that. 

00:18:55
SONYA PERDUTA Cool. Any, any other one that you've been thinking of in preparation for this show. 

00:19:00
JOE BELLIL Hahaha... Preparation for this show. 

00:19:05
SONYA PERDUTA Show, yes. 

00:19:05
JOE BELLIL When somebody talks with you, I think it's important, again I keep on saying you want to treat the person with the same respect you would treat anybody else and that means that if you, when you talk to your, for example if somebody is talking to a child, if you are an adult talking to a child what, do you wanna try to, you know for a long conversation you wanna kind of sit down or talk to the eye level of that individual, not up versus downwards. And I think, I think that's another perception that, that well, no, no it may not need to be a perception. 

00:19:40
SONYA PERDUTA No. Actually, actually, I think, I think you're, that's more of a disability adequate(ph) kind of thing which I think you should have a show on that as well. But, but I think where that comes from though is I think it's coming from the whole point of someone standing above you talking down to you and kind of and it's more of a condescending kind of physical kind of thing and I think that's where, where that might come from. It's a condescension, because I know I have been talked down to even though I have a degree, people sometimes don't respect that I have that degree and they'll say; Oh they gave it to you because you are, you are disabled. You never earned it, and I mean, even in jobs I've had people check my answers with someone else before they'd actually follow through on 'em. So, I think that's, that's an issue too of, I don't know, I guess there would be ignorance on their part, but they are not trusting that we are intelligent or capable of, of working in the, in the, in the workforce. 

00:20:25
MIKE KENNEDY Making out the right decision. 

00:20:30
SONYA PERDUTA In making right decisions and especially like making decisions even for our self as well as for, for others. I mean, because I think a lot of times people think that we need to have decisions made for us, because we are incapable of doing that ourselves. Does that ever happened to you, to you guys? 

00:20:45
JOE BELLIL Oh! 

00:20:45
MIKE KENNEDY Ah... I think yeah it would, you know, that they try to go, someone may try to go that route and I would just, you know quickly interject and say; Hey. You know, I know what, what's best for me. 

00:20:55
SONYA PERDUTA Hmm... So you looked at the skills and the confidence to pretty much... 

00:21:00
MIKE KENNEDY Right! 

00:21:00
SONYA PERDUTA ...be assertive and stand up for yourself, yeah. 

00:21:00
MIKE KENNEDY Yes I think that helps tremendously. 

00:21:05
SONYA PERDUTA Right. 

00:21:05
JOE BELLIL You mentioned employment. 

00:21:05
SONYA PERDUTA Ah good that's on my list, go Joe. Hahaha... 

00:21:10
JOE BELLIL I think, I think some people will view somebody with a disability and say oh, they, they are not able to work. You know, they are, they are probably living with some sort of institution or, or, or whatever, again, you know that's so wrong, but part of the problem is that, we have 70% of people with disability is not working and I think perception has been part of the problem. Peoples attitudes, the general publics attitudes about people with disabilities, so much as though they are not encouraging the folks, who have disabilities to go to work and I mean, we, we trigger accommodation as usual trigger, trans-station(ph)... 

00:21:45
SONYA PERDUTA And access and accesses. 

00:21:45
JOE BELLIL Sure and access, right. They're... Sometimes if you do have, if you're in this wheelchair for example, you may be limited at work where you can work, just because of the access issues or trans-station(ph) issues they get involved with that. 

00:22:00
SONYA PERDUTA Okay. 

00:22:00
JOE BELLIL But, I mean, I would say that the general public would view somebody with a disability. I think it's changing slowly but, again they would view somebody with disability, yeah, you probably don't work, you probably don't have education, blah blah blah... You know again really putting the person down, just based, you know based on the past. 

00:22:15
SONYA PERDUTA Based on the stereotype people who can't work. And, yeah it's an important thing, because if you even look at laws, federal and state laws, I mean federal laws has employment (inaudible ) disabilities act as what title one is employment, right. 

00:22:30
JOE BELLIL Hmm... right. 

00:22:30
SONYA PERDUTA Sorry, and so there is employment mandates there but when you look at state codes they really aren't a lot of employment mandates even when you're building new environments, employee areas don't have to be accessible, right, which I think is a whole interesting concept that they don't have to make employer as accessible, but people with disabilities have over 70% unemployment rate, but everyone, and then some people even think that, you know we drain the system because we don't work and, but they don't make it easy for us to go to work. 

00:23:00
JOE BELLIL Right. 

00:23:00
SONYA PERDUTA Or for, for people with disabilities of the community, when I say us I always mean the community, but they don't they don't allow us to, or don't give us the opportunities to do that. It's all interesting and you're right, it is is based on perceptions and stereotypes. 

00:23:15
JOE BELLIL Right. You gotta (inaudible ) to, to work, you know, so lot of people have, you know difficulties doing that. You know, the other thing I was thinking about is perceptions. How many times on TV do we see people who have or professionals that have some sort of disability. We hardly ever see that. I was just thinking of LA Law for example, you know they brief runs of that nowadays and I don't, I don't see too many people, lawyers, they are having any kind of disability and I think as, that's the concern for me. I think we need to see more people with disabilities in professional and actually in all different type of, of roles in just to help the public better understand that, you know folks with disabilities can be anywhere, can do anything. 

00:23:55
MIKE KENNEDY Right, well. You know you are talking about, you know people with disabilities have been portrayed on some TV shows, I am thinking of, was it ER (inaudible )they had showing that, you know walk with the cane, you know one of the things, I know, you know reading is, you know they're actual, you know actors out there with disabilities trying to get roles, you know playing someone with a disability. 

00:24:20
JOE BELLIL Hmm... 

00:24:20
MIKE KENNEDY Hey, what an idea! 

00:24:20
SONYA PERDUTA (Inaudible ). 

00:24:23
MIKE KENNEDY And but a lot of times, if the role is someone with a disability it's usually an able-body person, you know playing that... 

00:24:30
SONYA PERDUTA Playing that role. Exactly. 

00:24:35
MIKE KENNEDY So that's kind of interesting. I mean, because believe me there is, I've read this a lot of, yeah, I, you think the, the unemployment rate for is 70% to say, I would imagine disabled actors, it would even be higher. Hahaha... 

00:24:50
JOE BELLIL True. 

00:24:50
MIKE KENNEDY Right, so, and... 

00:24:50
JOE BELLIL And what's in the population that disability population is what 15-20%... 

00:24:55
SONYA PERDUTA Yeah. 

00:24:55
JOE BELLIL ...of the total population? 

00:24:55
SONYA PERDUTA I think it's close to, yeah close to 20%. 

00:25:00
JOE BELLIL So are we seeing 15-20% of the people on TV with disabilities. 

00:25:00
SONYA PERDUTA No. 

00:25:00
MIKE KENNEDY No. 

00:25:05
SONYA PERDUTA Of course, so we have no role model, so when you think of, for a children growing up with disabilities, they have no role models of what they can aspire to become and then when people become dramatically injured or develop their disabilities as they age then they are taught to... you don't see a lot of people in the workforce when you are working there so then you become disabled you think you can never go back to work and no one will allow you to go back because there is no access to go back. So then you are stuck and then because you are stuck then they, you get negatively treated because of that. It seems like we are running out of time guys and we need to, we need to close up. So what are your final comments on the, ah... ah... the perceptions and stereotypes? What you wanna say as your final important point to say to the viewers out there? 

00:25:50
MIKE KENNEDY Wow, I can't believe it, you know it went so quick. The other, the other one that used to drive me, that's years ago was people with disabilities are sick, or sickly. Ah... I remember, you know in my 28 years, you know using the wheelchair, I mean I was only in the hospital couple of times, you know I remember this nurse asking me, after she asked all these you know, stupid questions; Oh, wow, you must spend a lot of time in the hospitals, ah! 

00:26:15
SONYA PERDUTA Hahaha. 

00:26:20
MIKE KENNEDY It's like; No, no! 

00:26:20
SONYA PERDUTA What does bothers you anyway. 

00:26:25
MIKE KENNEDY Yeah that, that really but to Joe, but of course she works there, but yeah, I just felt that incredibly insulting and, oh, one other time too I remember I was actually in the hospital visiting someone and you know this security guy, this you know toy-cop kind of guy, like, you know, he says; Are you a patient here? I said; No, do I look like a patient? 

00:26:45
SONYA PERDUTA Patient. 

00:26:45
MIKE KENNEDY Yeah. He says, yeah I said, no! He says, What are you doing on the wheelchair? 

00:26:50
SONYA PERDUTA So the assumption was because you are in a chair you are patient at that hospital. 

00:26:55
MIKE KENNEDY Right. Yeah. Right. (Inaudible ) my jeans and my, you know T-shirt I did, like come on, that just oh freaked me out. 

00:27:05
SONYA PERDUTA Hmm... That can't, and Joe any final comments? 

00:27:05
JOE BELLIL I mentioned before about just treating people with respect and just like you would treat anybody else and whether it's a hand shake and I think, I found that lot of times that people may not shake my hand because I use a chair and they, whether they feel I am not able to do that or if I can do it, you know, I am not sure what it is sometimes, but again just if, when you talk an adult who has a disability, treat 'em as an adult as you would anybody else when you meet with a child with a disability, treat, treat that, treat the child as a child, person... 

00:27:35
SONYA PERDUTA As an individual. 

00:27:35
JOE BELLIL Right, as an individual and, and, allow them to have, have the rights, same rights as anybody else does and, and when somebody is sitting at a restaurant, you know don't turn to the person without the disability to ask them what... 

00:27:50
SONYA PERDUTA What they want? 

00:27:50
JOE BELLIL Right. What they want. Yeah. 

00:27:50
MIKE KENNEDY Oh yeah. Oh my god. 

00:27:50
SONYA PERDUTA What would you like to eat, yes. That's always a good thing. 

00:27:55
MIKE KENNEDY Oh, (crosstalk)(inaudible) I got mad. 

00:27:55
JOE BELLIL Oh yeah, I know, I know. 

00:27:55
SONYA PERDUTA Well I think we should, we should do something definitely on disability. Ah... But just a few things I wanna mention that we didn't get around to talk in about, but we had good discussion, but the interesting one about that people with disabilities cannot have children, cannot be parents, I know myself, I am parent and lot of times everyone assumes the child is someone else's and not mine, lot's of issues there and that we don't make good partners or good spouses because either very asexual or we can't have a job or we don't think or you all those kind of things and there were all you know substance abusers or drug addicts or alcoholics and, and that we might frighten people and intimidate people very much. I mean, those are all kind of really misperceptions and stereotypes. I mean, you can see it from the three of us, we are pretty common Joes as we speak, you know and it just that we travel through our environments you know in different ways than other people. So, in conclusion I'd like to say that Joe, Mike and I want you all understand that every person with a disability is not like every other person with a disability. We are like all other Americans. We want that continuum. Some of us can be happy, nice and kind, and some of us can be sad, mean and just plain cruel. Ah... We just want things like the rest of society. We want what many Americans want, we want jobs, houses, transportations, relationships, sex and children, if we want those. Hahaha... And just like the rest of society, just like the rest of society, and just remember that we are people too like Joe brought out continuously and I think that's the greatest point and we all want to be treated like individuals. Not one of us is the same in anyway, in anyway just because we all sit that might be our only similarities that we sit and push a wheelchair, the three of us anyway. So final things, so, supercrip or too dependent or too independent, what are we all? 

00:29:50
MIKE KENNEDY Well I like to be a supercrip myself. Hahaha...
