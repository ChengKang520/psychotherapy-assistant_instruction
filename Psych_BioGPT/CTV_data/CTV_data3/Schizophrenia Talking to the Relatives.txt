David Goldberg 

00:00:00
DAVID GOLDBERG  There are two main reasons for giving accurate information to the families of schizophrenic patients. The first is the humanitarian one. Families often report that they feel like they were given very bad information about the illness that was affecting their relative. If they were given better information, they would feel better and they will be better able to cope with the illness itself. The second is because recent research indicates that the way in which a patient is handled by his family actually affects the cause of the illness itself, is therefore since in which giving accurate information to families constitutes part of the treatment of the illness. Graeme McGrath is a staff psychiatrist on my unit and he and I have got together today with two people in training on the unit. Dr. Sarah Davenport is a psychiatrist in her first year of training and Mrs. Vicky Coffog is a psychiatric social work student. Sarah what problems have you encountered so far in talking to relatives? 

00:01:40
SARAH DAVENPORT  Well, I have three main problems really, the first is the diagnosis... (crosstalk) 

00:01:45
DAVID GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:01:45
SARAH DAVENPORT ...and how to give it. I mean, I find to actually say the word schizophrenia very hard to a relative. And then there's the question of, of the genetic component because I feel that relatives often feel responsible for... (crosstalk) 

00:02:00
DAVID GOLDBERG Hmm. 

00:02:00
SARAH DAVENPORT ...an illness that they may have passed on to their child and then indeed if the patient says to you, "Can I have a family?" What do I say then? 

00:02:05
DAVID GOLDBERG Hmm. 

00:02:05
SARAH DAVENPORT  And thirdly, I often wonder who the best person to actually give the information to the patient would be whether it would be me, ah, or indeed the social worker. 

00:02:15
DAVID GOLDBERG Vicky, what kind of problems have you had? 

00:02:20
VICKY COFFOG Well, initially, I've got the same set of problems as Sarah I supposed uhm, I totally agree with her on the points about diagnosis and, uhm, actually mentioning the word schizophrenia and also as to who should impart the information, medical people or social workers, it's often very vague... (crosstalk) 

00:02:40
DAVID GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:02:40
VICKY COFFOG ...as to who should be saying what or who indeed has already said what. And, but I have three particular problems other than that. The first, being that a relative will come to me and say, "How long are our lives going to be influenced in this way by this illness?" And they can only see black in the future and I'm very, very uncertain about what I should say in response to that. 

00:03:05
DAVID GOLDBERG Uh hmm. 

00:03:05
VICKY COFFOG Secondly, of course, and they often relate how the patient is behaving very, very difficultly at home and they interpret that behavior as being bad, as the patient being wicked and putting... (crosstalk) 

00:03:20
DAVID GOLDBERG Hmm. 

00:03:20
VICKY COFFOG ...them through all this on purpose and how should I actually go about telling them that perhaps it's part of the illness... (crosstalk) 

00:03:25
DAVID GOLDBERG Hmm. 

00:03:25
VICKY COFFOG ...and that is it actually part of the illness. And finally I think that links up with another problem. I've heard colleagues of mine say that, uhm, over involve families and families where there's a lot of criticism about, that atmosphere can actually make the cause of the illness a lot worse... (crosstalk) 

00:03:45
DAVID GOLDBERG Hmm. 

00:03:45
VICKY COFFOG ...for the schizophrenic patient. I really need to know is that right? 

00:03:50
DAVID GOLDBERG Hmm. 

00:03:50
VICKY COFFOG And how on earth should I go to, about advising families if that is right. 

00:03:55
GRAEME MCGRATH  The first problems that Sarah and Vicky mentioned occur in the early stages of the illness when we have to establish contact and give accurate information to the relatives. 

00:04:05
DAVID GOLDBERG Yes, I think they were both telling us that there were problems in giving the diagnosis and actually naming the illness and that's, of course, exactly what the relatives of schizophrenic patients complained about... (crosstalk) 

00:04:15
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm. 

00:04:15
DAVID GOLDBERG  that nobody at the hospital tells them what's wrong with the patient, so that was the first problem. 

00:04:20
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm, and they were both concerned with the problem of explaining the genetic risks to relatives. Parents are naturally worried about whether they've handed the illness on. 

00:04:30
DAVID GOLDBERG Okay, so that's two and Vicky went on to say that she had problems giving the prognosis to relatives especially when she wasn't sure that it was going to be anyway. 

00:04:40
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm, so that's the third problem, they both have difficulty with who it is that gives what information? Who sees the relatives at what stage of the illness? And my feeling is very strongly that medical information should be given by doctors, by medical staff and it is quite inappropriate to ask social workers to deal with that sort of thing. 

00:04:55
DAVID GOLDBERG Hmm, okay, let's deal with these early problems first. I suppose the trainees instinctively feel that they shouldn't just blurt out the diagnosis. Of course, they're quite right. It's important to let the relatives themselves talk and tell us what they've noticed wrong with the patient. (crosstalk) 

00:05:15
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm. 

00:05:15
DAVID GOLDBERG And express their feelings about what they have seen. 

00:05:20
GRAEME MCGRATH Yes, of course, the relative should be given the name of the illness but it shouldn't be given entirely on its own. It's important; perhaps, the first thing is to relate the diagnosis, the name schizophrenia to just those symptoms that the relatives have noticed in the patient. 

00:05:30
DAVID GOLDBERG  Having given them a diagnosis related to what's been going wrong with their relative, of course, one has to go on to give a context to the diagnosis of schizophrenia and that's going to mean giving information about schizophrenia as an illness. I think, it's probably pretty important we show how that's done and that better include giving information about risk factors and genetic factors. 

00:05:55
GRAEME MCGRATH  Hmm, I think one of the problems about giving information about genetic factors is that parents do often feel that they've transmitted the illness themselves and that increases any sense of guilt that they might have. Now guilt is an emotion that does get in the way of being able to communicate and being able to help people, so I think it's vitally important to avoid any atmosphere that implies criticism or blame. 

00:06:20
DAVID GOLDBERG It's quite right and where prognosis is concerned, of course, the skill I think is to learn how to look on the bright side while still being honest and giving accurate information. I think that's really quite enough to be getting on with. Let's move now and let's watch you interview the parents of one of our patients. 

00:06:35
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:06:35
GRAEME MCGRATH  I'm glad you are able to come here today because now that Peter's been in hospital for a few days I think it's important that we got together so I can tell you a bit about what I think is going on but first of all- 

00:06:50
Let relatives talk 

00:06:50
GRAEME MCGRATH - I'd like to find out a bit about what it is that you've noticed? 

00:06:50
MIKE GIBLIN (clears throat) Well, (clears throat) I suppose basically it started at home and as far as I am concerned he's changed completely. I mean a lot he used to be, he's, he used to be a quiet, hardworking, modest, careful of his appearance and now well, he, he's downright scruffy. 

00:07:10
MONICA BAYNES  His manners are terrible, you should see the way he eats his dinner. 

00:07:15
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm, so his behavior and perhaps his personality had changed. 

00:07:20
MIKE GIBLIN  Yes, he doesn't give a damn anymore. He doesn't even care and what, well I think it's affecting younger children and frankly I'm, I'm worried about that. 

00:07:30
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm, I gather that you were in two alarming incidents recently. 

00:07:35
MONICA BAYNES Yes, there was the vase, uhm, I have this vase, it was a wedding present. And I was very attached to it and, ah, he broke it and when I asked him why he said someone told him to do it. There was no one in the room. 

00:07:50
MIKE GIBLIN You know, it's ridiculous, I, he goes around muttering to himself all the time... (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:07:55
MIKE GIBLIN ...and done it since then? And then the other night, I was watching the television, watching the news. He walks across the room and in other word switches the television off and, well, I mean, I don't know. I mean, perhaps I overreacted but I don't think so. I said what the hell he meant bias and, he, he became quite abusive... (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
MONICA BAYNES Uh hmm. 

00:08:10
MIKE GIBLIN ...and, and threatening. 

00:08:10
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:08:10
MONICA BAYNES  I thought he was gonna hit you. 

00:08:15
MIKE GIBLIN Oh yes, yes. 

00:08:15
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm, so I guess you must have formed- 

00:08:15
Find out what they think 

00:08:15
GRAEME MCGRATH - some idea yourself of what might be going on? 

00:08:20
MONICA BAYNES Uh hmm, I think it has something to do with the university. He's supposed to be resetting his exams and his heart isn't in it. I think perhaps he should never have been an engineer. 

00:08:30
MIKE GIBLIN No, I don't think so. I think, I think that was okay. He wanted to be, I, well, perhaps and he's getting in with the wrong lot there, I, I'm... (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm. 

00:08:35
MIKE GIBLIN ...in fact, it took me but I think he is on drugs. I think he's got into that crowd and I think that's the cause of the whole thing. 

00:08:40
GRAEME MCGRATH Well, that's a very important point but from talking to Peter himself and to some of his friends I think that it's very unlikely that what's happened is to deal with drugs. In fact, I think that what's happening at the moment is that Peter is suffering from really quite a severe mental illness. 

00:09:00
Pause for response 

00:09:00
MIKE GIBLIN  Mental illness? 

00:09:05
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm. 

00:09:05
MONICA BAYNES You mean a mental breakdown, something like that? (crosstalk) 

00:09:05
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:09:05
MIKE GIBLIN  What, what sort of illness? 

00:09:10
GRAEME MCGRATH  Oh it's one- 

00:09:15
Name the illness 

00:09:15
GRAEME MCGRATH - of the group of illnesses that we call schizophrenia. Now, I guess that's the word you must have heard of. You must have some ideas of your own about what that means? 

00:09:20
Find out what they think 

00:09:20
MONICA BAYNES  But schizophrenia, that's people who are violent and dangerous. He's not like that all. 

00:09:30
MIKE GIBLIN Yeah, I mean, isn't it something, I mean schizophrenia; it's something with split personality. I don't, I mean I know I've said he's, he's been almost violent but, ah, I mean, I, I don't know. I said, I mean now this is a doctor, you'd know ah, but schizophrenia? 

00:09:45
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm, well I do think so and I'll, I'll tell you why more precisely in a moment but first could I answer the- 

00:09:55
Amplify diagnosis 

00:09:55
GRAEME MCGRATH - couple of questions that you've raised, uhm, I don't think that split personality is, is necessarily a good way of looking at it. I think people with schizophrenia are often split-off but they tend to be split off from reality and from other people and where is it, it is true that very rarely people with schizophrenia can be violent. It is rare and I don't think for one moment that Peter is actually showing that sort of behavior at the moment. Now the things that have been affecting Peter are, are all the things- 

00:10:25
Relate diagnosis to patient's symptoms 

00:10:25
GRAEME MCGRATH - that you've noticed yourself recently. Uhm, he's, first of all, he's been affected the way he experiences things. So, for instance, he tells me that he's been hearing voices. Now those voices have been saying very rude and unpleasant things to him. And especially at meal times which is perhaps why you've noticed he's rather off behavior then. The other thing that you spoke about this vase when we spoke, when we talked to him, he said that, that at the time he broke the vase because he felt that he was being controlled by an outside influence and that it wasn't him breaking the vase at all. Now those are both symptoms of schizophrenia, but as you can understand, they are very unusual and unpleasant and frightening for Peter. So that he's been rather bewildered and perhaps that explains some of the aggressiveness that's he's been feeling. 

00:11:15
MONICA BAYNES But what causes that sort of illness? We've nothing like that in the family. 

00:11:20
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm, you did tell the doctor in the ward that you had an aunt who had been in a mental hospital sometime ago and there are occasions it's a genetic component. 

00:11:30
MONICA BAYNES You mean he got it from us? 

00:11:30
GRAEME MCGRATH Well, schizophrenia does tend to run in families- 

00:11:35
Answer questions 

00:11:35
GRAEME MCGRATH - and sometimes it may be a very distant relative who's involved, however, it does very commonly come out of the blue and there are other things that may influence it. For instance, we know that injuries at birth can increase the risk of getting schizophrenia later or now. 

00:11:50
MONICA BAYNES But what about the other two children, might they get it? 

00:11:50
GRAEME MCGRATH  There is a slight increased risk of them getting schizophrenia because they have a brother who has it. And now, I have to emphasize that in fact the chances of them not getting it are very, very much higher. There was one other thing that you were asking though, about whether the stress of the university could have caused... (crosstalk) 

00:12:15
MONICA BAYNES Uh hmm. 

00:12:15
GRAEME MCGRATH ...this sort of illness. Now, I don't feel that stress actually causes schizophrenia but there is some evidence that stresses can perhaps make the symptoms worst or perhaps can bring on episodes of relapses of the old. 

00:12:30
MONICA BAYNES You see his dad has been away a lot. He worked for a firm... (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
MIKE GIBLIN Uh hmm. 

00:12:35
MONICA BAYNES ...that involved a lot of meetings and conferences sometimes abroad. 

00:12:40
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:12:40
MONICA BAYNES Could that have anything to do with it? 

00:12:40
MIKE GIBLIN Ah, yes, yes, I, I have been abroad but that's the job, I mean I try to be home as often as I could. (crosstalk) 

00:12:45
GRAEME MCGRATH Hmm. No. I think it's most unlikely that- 

00:12:50
Avoid blaming parents 

00:12:50
GRAEME MCGRATH  you're being away has anything to do with him developing schizophrenia. But it is actually true that a lot of the families that we see feel that they might be in some way responsible... (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
MONICA BAYNES Hmm. 

00:13:00
GRAEME MCGRATH ...for the illness coming on. Where there any other ways in which you felt? 

00:13:05
MONICA BAYNES Well I was just thinking, I was in hospital when Peter was eight and he had to stay... (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm. 

00:13:10
MONICA BAYNES ...with his grandmother for about six months, could that have brought it on? 

00:13:15
GRAEME MCGRATH No, there's no- 

00:13:15
Decrease parents guilt 

00:13:15
GRAEME MCGRATH - evidence at all that separations of that sort can cause schizophrenia. 

00:13:20
MIKE GIBLIN But why did it start now, not years ago? 

00:13:25
GRAEME MCGRATH That's hard to say but it certainly is most common that people develop the symptoms of schizophrenia in early adult life, much the same age as Peter is now. 

00:13:35
MIKE GIBLIN Why? I mean will he be all right? Will he, will he change? Will he become violent or anything? I mean we were hoping that he's gonna come out of the university this term. 

00:13:40
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm, well, clearly one of the difficulties about the future is that I cannot predict exactly what's going to happen. However, in the immediate future one thing that is certain is that he'll have to spend quite a long time in hospital and people spend an average two to three months in hospital when an episode of illness like this and I guess that he'll be in for certainly several weeks at the very least. 

00:14:05
MONICA BAYNES Uh hmm. We can't leave him at home, the way he is now. 

00:14:05
GRAEME MCGRATH  Hmm. Well, I understand that. (crosstalk) 

00:14:10
MONICA BAYNES Uh hmm. 

00:14:10
GRAEME MCGRATH One of the things that will influence- 

00:14:10
Explain benefits of treatment 

00:14:10
GRAEME MCGRATH  the cause of the illness in the future is the treatment that he receives. Now, we do have drugs that can materially affect that and he's already started on some drugs that we call major tranquilizers that will most certainly reduce the symptoms and hopefully, we'll, uhm, help clear up the symptoms even though he's virtually could come back. 

00:14:30
MIKE GIBLIN Ah, and after that, will he be okay? I mean, will he be able to go back to college? 

00:14:35
GRAEME MCGRATH  Again, that's- 

00:14:40
Encourage optimism... 

00:14:40
GRAEME MCGRATH - uhm, another problem is predicting the future. However, what I can say is that certainly, quite a lot of people who develop schizophrenia do very well. In fact, one person in three who gets schizophrenia recovers completely from an episode like Peter's and we certainly have had a number of patients, who've been able to go back and resume their previous careers, including people who been into university. 

00:15:00
MIKE GIBLIN  Thus so, he will be all right then, it, it will, it will go? 

00:15:05
GRAEME MCGRATH  Well, again, that's something that is very hard to say. I'm afraid to say that- 

00:15:15
...but give realistic prognosis 

00:15:15
GRAEME MCGRATH - the chances are, although it may well be that this episode will clear up and he'll never have another episode in his life, the chances are that there is a possibility that he's going to develop another similar episode at some time in his life and perhaps, more than one. Anyway, I'm afraid I've said an awful lot to you today and I guess it's a lot to try and take it in one interview. I'm sure you want to go and think about some of the things I've said and talk about it yourselves and I'm sure... (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
MONICA BAYNES Uh hmm. 

00:15:45
GRAEME MCGRATH ...you'll have a lot more questions to ask. Now, I think it's important that we keep in touch and what I'd like to do is arrange to see you again and I'd like to arrange, if it's all right with you to arrange to see you with one of our social workers because he's will be keeping in touch with you over the next few weeks and months, uhm, and it will be... (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
MONICA BAYNES Uh hmm. 

00:16:00
GRAEME MCGRATH ...your way of keeping in contact with us. So, perhaps I could arrange that now. 

00:16:05
MIKE GIBLIN Hmm. 

00:16:05
[sil.] 

00:16:05
GRAEME MCGRATH  In that interview, I began to talk to the relatives about schizophrenia and some of the problems associated with it. I also made arrangements to introduce them to our social worker. Now let's go on to discuss some of the other problems that our trainees had. 

00:16:25
GRAEME MCGRATH  The second area our trainees were concerned about is after the illness has become established and the first point that Vicky made was that sometimes it's very difficult to help relatives understand the difference between the symptoms of schizophrenia and what they see as simply bad or malicious behavior. 

00:16:45
DAVID GOLDBERG Uh hmm. And then she went on to make another point but it was also important and that was that although most trainees nowadays know that they should try to reduce the expressed emotion in some families, they really don't know how to do that and how they should actually set about reducing the amount of contact between the patient and the relatives in a home that has high expressed emotion. 

00:17:05
GRAEME MCGRATH Uh hmm, that's right. In concerning the first point, well, the first thing that has to be done is to get the relatives to describe that behavior that they see is bad. 

00:17:10
DAVID GOLDBERG And ventilate their feelings about that bad behavior. 

00:17:15
GRAEME MCGRATH Right and only then can the professional use his knowledge to help them understand what behaviors are actually part of the illness but what about the point about contact? 

00:17:20
DAVID GOLDBERG  Before you even think of counseling a relative, you have to obtain accurate information about the amount of interaction that actually occurs between the relative and the patient and that has to be done carefully. 

00:17:35
GRAEME MCGRATH Right, you can't begin to counsel somebody and until you have established a rapport. And I think that it's important to show that you're trying to understand what problems and difficulties they have. 

00:17:45
DAVID GOLDBERG And if you show that kind of understanding, you could expect the ventilation of quite a lot of emotion and when that emotion is being shown, after that you can go on to give quite sensible practical advice about what could be done to help the situation. 

00:18:00
GRAEME MCGRATH  In Peter's case, initially things went well and he was discharged to our day hospital. However, after a while he stopped attending and he was discharged to out-patient care. Our social worker kept in touched with the family and sometime later, further difficulties arose and we're about to see his interview with him at that time. The first thing we'll show is how he deals with the parent's problems concerning illness and bad behavior. 

00:18:25
MONICA BAYNES  It's difficult to know where to begin. He stays in bed most of the day. 

00:18:30
TERRY MCDONALD Uh hmm. 

00:18:30
MONICA BAYNES  He's up the most of the night. He is not washing. He's a bit smelly. 

00:18:35
Establish relative's views 

00:18:35
MONICA BAYNES  He's, only goes to bed in his clothes, that's another thing. He's irritating us all in different ways, isn't it? 

00:18:45
MIKE GIBLIN Yes, that's right. It's, it's not he was in the first place before the illness. I mean, that seems to have cleared now but he's, he's just as bad as he was. He's scruffy, he's dirty and another thing he, he's dead to me. He can't do anything but then sometimes he'll flair up and switch the television off, throw newspapers across the room. 

00:19:05
TERRY MCDONALD  Hmm, and he's kinda normal isn't it children must have them. 

00:19:10
Obtain information 

00:19:10
TERRY MCDONALD What does he say, when, when you ask him about the outburst, what he's? 

00:19:15
MIKE GIBLIN Well, he became a very aggressive and, I mean, you might just say to him well "Why don't you change you're clothes?" He throw around something quite noxious, quite or anything, flares into his temper and he's very, very abusive and quite aggressive. 

00:19:30
MONICA BAYNES Uh hmm. 

00:19:30
MIKE GIBLIN He threatens and sometimes he, ah, he makes a fist as if he was gonna hit. 

00:19:35
MONICA BAYNES Yeah, sometimes I think he is going to hit you really; it's a bit frightening. 

00:19:40
MIKE GIBLIN Well, well he did and, you know, he, he, I think that was a while ago, he was going to do it. It was very close. 

00:19:45
TERRY MCDONALD So it sounds, it sounds that you both are coming close- 

00:19:50
Acknowledge feelings 

00:19:50
TERRY MCDONALD - to the end of the tavern? 

00:19:50
MONICA BAYNES Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
TERRY MCDONALD Up there. 

00:19:50
MONICA BAYNES  I'm worried about the other children, really. They're both got exams and one of them is doing History for A level and Peter tore up her History book. He said there was something in it about him. 

00:20:05
MIKE GIBLIN Bloody rubbish, everything seems to be, to do with him when he gets like this. 

00:20:10
TERRY MCDONALD So, he still feels that there are some references actually going on. 

00:20:15
MIKE GIBLIN Well, that's what he says, but if you ask me. I think he's putting it on most of the time. In fact, I think he does it just to annoy me. 

00:20:25
TERRY MCDONALD Well, that, that sometimes does happen. But I think in Peter's case, things are still specifically referring to him just as, was the case when he was in the hospital. Something, you both going to have to learn, is the difference- 

00:20:40
Distinguish illness from bad behaviour 

00:20:40
TERRY MCDONALD - between what is illness and what is bad behavior. Simple-bloody-mindedness and we will be able to help in that. We would be able to try and teach you but one of the hardest things you gonna learn or for anybody to learn is trying to cope with somebody who is mentally ill and that aspect of their illness. But before we, we talk to any great length about that, I would like to ask now- 

00:21:10
Obtain information 

00:21:10
TERRY MCDONALD - just how much time you both spend with Peter in a day, over, over any given days? 

00:21:15
MIKE GIBLIN  Well, speaking for myself and, I mean, I work all day, of course, ah, it's just an hour or two in the evening. 

00:21:25
TERRY MCDONALD Uh hmm. 

00:21:25
MONICA BAYNES I work part-time in the mornings. I'm at home in the afternoon, evening but it's the weekends that are the really difficult time. And that's when we all live together. 

00:21:35
MIKE GIBLIN Yes, that's true. That's right. 

00:21:35
TERRY MCDONALD Some of the things that you've been telling me- 

00:21:40
Show understanding 

00:21:40
TERRY MCDONALD - sound as though, there's a lot of tension within the family. And I'm wondering just how much of that tension is generated over a concern regarding Peter's welfare, is that possible? 

00:21:50
MIKE GIBLIN  I'm not sure what you mean. 

00:21:55
TERRY MCDONALD Well, I was thinking about the watching, the waiting for him to do something. You're intend to hooks and somehow that's generated to Peter. Is that possible? 

00:22:05
MIKE GIBLIN Well, I suppose we are a bit apprehensive... (crosstalk) 

00:22:10
MONICA BAYNES Uh hmm 

00:22:10
MIKE GIBLIN ...at times. 

00:22:10
TERRY MCDONALD I think, you both going- 

00:22:15
Offer advice 

00:22:15
TERRY MCDONALD - to have to try and reduce the amount of contact that you have in a day with Peter. Face-to-face contact with schizophrenic like Peter and those closest to or nearest to him can quite often trigger and arouse some of these outbursts that you've been describing to me. 

00:22:35
MIKE GIBLIN Hmm, well. (clears throat) I see what you mean about provoking but, to be honest, I don't see how we're going to do it. I mean, are we, are we to just let him stay in his bed all day and rot, to keep out his way or what? 

00:22:50
TERRY MCDONALD No, the, there's a medium, there, there's a balance. A balance that you will learn, knowing what the right amount of encouragement is and the right amount of living a regular life. 

00:23:00
GRAEME MCGRATH The social worker goes on to offer them a number of practical suggestions about the ways that they interact as a family. However, Peter's parents are by no means sure how things will go and the social worker is beginning to think in terms of Peter's possibly moving away from home. Let's see how he goes on to deal with reducing the amount of contact between the parents and their son. 

00:23:20
TERRY MCDONALD  So, there are problems for your other children too? 

00:23:25
MONICA BAYNES  Yes, there are because they want to bring friends home and it's very embarrassing. Peter is there and he doesn't wash and he doesn't go out, take any exercise and he smokes all the time. That's another thing. He never used to. I think it's something he picked up in the hospital. 

00:23:40
TERRY MCDONALD Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
MIKE GIBLIN Yes, he, he's become like a dominant, almost. 

00:23:45
TERRY MCDONALD That must be a- 

00:23:45
Show understanding 

00:23:45
TERRY MCDONALD - tremendously difficult thing to live with. 

00:23:50
MONICA BAYNES It's tense, you see, and I'm really worried about the other children. 

00:23:50
TERRY MCDONALD Yeah, of course. It's not just the stress and strain that it puts on you, as the parents, but it, it's affected the house and the whole family and the friends and. (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
MONICA BAYNES Oh, that's right you see. I mean, it's- 

00:24:00
Allow ventilation of feelings 

00:24:00
MONICA BAYNES - not much of a life for those other two. They want to be normal teenagers, bring their friends in, go out and enjoy themselves. (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
TERRY MCDONALD Uh hmm. 

00:24:05
MONICA BAYNES  And there's Peter there all the time. I mean, how would you like it, a boy like that in your family? 

00:24:10
MIKE GIBLIN  And he, he says he's bored. I mean, uhm, of course, he's bloody bored. He doesn't do anything all day. 

00:24:20
MONICA BAYNES Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
MIKE GIBLIN He lies about. 

00:24:20
TERRY MCDONALD Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
MONICA BAYNES I bring him to the outpatients for his appointments. 

00:24:25
TERRY MCDONALD Uh hmm. 

00:24:25
MIKE GIBLIN Yes and, and he knows at times that he's there for injections. I mean, when we came here six months ago, the doctor said that they would cure him but ah, their curing him all I can say is it's taking a bloody long time to do it. (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
MONICA BAYNES Uh hmm. Yeah. 

00:24:35
TERRY MCDONALD Well, maybe, maybe cure is the wrong concept. 

00:24:35
Give information 

00:24:35
TERRY MCDONALD  Injections, drugs they do control the symptoms and they take the steam out of the condition. But they can't do a great deal about the more negative symptoms, the lack of drive. Drugs just can't do that. 

00:24:55
MONICA BAYNES Well, I mean, that's a bit of a blow to us, isn't it. You mean, we've got to just put up with it, that he's gonna go on like this forever. 

00:25:00
TERRY MCDONALD  No, not at all. I understand that things are very, very difficult at the moment- 

00:25:05
Acknowledge difficulties 

00:25:05
TERRY MCDONALD  and that you must be feeling rather hopeless as to what you more you can do for Peter. But one thing you both gonna have to do and that's to, to reassess your, your expectations of Peter. From some of the things you say about his behavior, they sound fairly characteristic of somebody with a very serious schizophrenic breakdown, the, the lack of drive, the, the boredom. They're all part and parcel of the negative side of the, the illness that you'll have to learn to accept. 

00:25:45
MIKE GIBLIN But suppose, suppose we do everything you suggest and it doesn't work. I mean, I mean we've got the other two children to consider me. To be honest, I'm half a mind to tell him he can clear out. 

00:25:50
MONICA BAYNES  And that bothers me. I mean just suppose you did, what would happen to Peter out on the streets? 

00:26:00
TERRY MCDONALD Well, it does sometimes happen that the relatives of the boy like Peter can no longer cope with him living with them. But in actual fact, it may well be in Peter's best interest and the best interest of the whole family if Peter were to maybe change his living envi, environment. How would you feel about that? 

00:26:20
MIKE GIBLIN  Well, well I, I mean, I know we've, we've said that, ah, he is, he gets in a temper and he's like this. I think I've been calling him, but, uhm, you know, we wouldn't like to throw him out really. It's a, I mean... (crosstalk) 

00:26:35
MONICA BAYNES Hmm. 

00:26:35
MIKE GIBLIN ...you know, underneath it all. I mean, he is our son and we, we do care for him and. (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
MONICA BAYNES Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
TERRY MCDONALD Well, I can see, I can see that you care for him. I can also see that you have a great love for him and that's one of the reasons why you would want to him to stay in the family set up. But also, I think maybe there's an element of,- 

00:26:55
Reduce any guilt at son's possible departure 

00:26:55
TERRY MCDONALD - it's your responsibility and somehow you'll be letting the side down if you, to let him... (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
MONICA BAYNES Uh hmm. 

00:26:55
TERRY MCDONALD  go. 

00:27:00
MONICA BAYNES What sort of other environment do you mean? 

00:27:00
TERRY MCDONALD Well, somebody of Peter's age. I think, we'll probably do quite well in, in our local authority rehabilitation hostel, for example. 

00:27:10
MONICA BAYNES But you see, at home he's got his own room. He's got a stereo. He's got nice things around him. 

00:27:15
TERRY MCDONALD Uh hmm. 

00:27:15
MONICA BAYNES And what would it be like for him in a hostel? 

00:27:15
TERRY MCDONALD  Well, the hostel is only one provision but the hostel I'm thinking about does provide the residents with their own room. It provides them with a strip till to the day. It gives them involved in the community that they're living in. And generally the aim is to increase the level of function of the residents. 

00:27:35
MONICA BAYNES But, would there be people who really cared about him? I mean, what about the other residents? They could be quite a bad influence on him, I would think. 

00:27:45
MIKE GIBLIN That's right. I mean, you know. We don't really want to throw him out and, and to be honest and what we really like is for Peter to get better and, and then leave home perhaps in a more natural way. You know, like anybody else. 

00:28:00
TERRY MCDONALD Well, that's the plan I'd like to try and, but before we, we make any final decisions. I'd like to tell you more about the hostels and the other provisions that that we and the local authority can provide. So that you're fully aware of what options you have, should it become necessary and should the split actually. 

00:28:20
DAVID GOLDBERG  You have now seen excerpts from three interviews with these parents but a typical family will need to be seen on far more than three occasions. It's wrong to try to tell a family all that they need to know about schizophrenia in a single session because they simply can't take it in. It's also important that information about the diagnosis should be given to families by a doctor who should regard this as an important part of his or her professional work. Living with a patient with schizophrenia imposes a considerable burden on families. We hope we've shown you the importance of allowing relatives to give us information before we try to give them any and allowing them to express their feelings about the events that have occurred in the family before we try to alter the family's behavior.
