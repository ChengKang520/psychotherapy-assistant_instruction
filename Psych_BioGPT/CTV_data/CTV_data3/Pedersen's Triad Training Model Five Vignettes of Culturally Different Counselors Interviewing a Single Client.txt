MICROTRAINING ASSOCIATES (888)505-5576 www.emictrotraining.com MIROTRAINING ASSOCIATES PRESENTS The Triad Training Model: Hearing the Pro and Anti-Counselor in multicultural counseling Paul B. Pedersen Professor Emeritus Syracuse University Visiting Professor, Department of Psychology, University of Hawaii Introduction: Paul B. Pedersen Introducing the Client, Procounselor, Anticounselor Team a. Client Noela S. Yamamoto b. Procounselor Melody S. Fo c. Anticounselor Lianne Koki 

00:00:00
PAUL B. PEDERSEN  Every counseling interview contains three simultaneous conversations. The first is, of course, the verbal exchange between the counselor and the client, second is the client's internal dialogue, and the third is the counselor's internal dialogue. Now, the counselor is able to monitor the verbal exchange between the counselor and the client, and the counselor is able to monitor the counselor's own internal dialogue. The difficulty is in understanding what the client is thinking but not saying. And of course, the more cultural differences there are between the client and the counselor, the more difficult it's going to be to hear what that client is thinking but not saying. But the counselor does know two things about what the client is thinking. He knows that part of what the client is thinking is negative, and part of what the client is thinking is positive. The Pedersen Triad Training Model is a model that combines role-played interviews of a counselor from one culture and a client from a different culture. And it involves also the introduction of a third person a procounselor, think of that person as a, sort of, an angel, and the fourth person as an anticounselor, think of that person as a, sort of, a devil, in the interview. The anticounselor will be articulating the negative things that the client is thinking but not saying, and the procounselor will be articulating the positive things that a client is thinking but not saying. There are four skill areas that this model attempts to train in. First is articulating the problem from the client's cultural point of view, not imposing your own point of view on the client, but hearing it from the client's point of view. Second is recognizing resistance in specific rather than vague general terms. We've all blown an interview but not known why we, what we did wrong, what, why that client would never come back. Here, the anticounselor will tell you, even as you're making the mistake why that client is giving you resistance. Third is reducing counselor defensiveness. If you're ever gonna be defensive, it'll be with an anticounselor taking shots at you as you're attempting to do your best job in counseling. And, ah, the problem with, ah, defensiveness, is that it per, it presents increased barriers to the counseling interview. And, of course, the fourth is recovery skills. What do you do or say after you've said or done the wrong thing? In the following short role-played interviews, you will be seeing a counselor or therapist from one culture and a client from a different culture, ah, accompanied by a procounselor and an anticounselor from the client's culture. For more information on this Pedersen Triad Training Model, I recommend that you look at the book by Paul Pedersen, year 2000, Hidden Messages and Culture-Centered Counseling: A Triad Training Model. That's available through Sage Publications at Thousand Oaks, California.

MELODY S. FO You're both women. 

00:05:05

00:05:10
LIANNE KOKI  I'm uneasy. (crosstalk) 

00:05:15

LIANNE KOKI She doesn't understand. 

00:05:30
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uhm, well, I'm glad that, that you asked that question because I've been having some really hard problems, you know, with issues of, of guilt and, uhm, saving face being... (crosstalk) 

00:05:45
LIANNE KOKI Guilt. 

00:05:45
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO ...that I'm gonna be moving... (crosstalk) 

00:05:45
MELODY S. FO Saving face. 

00:05:45
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO ...away to a different town. And, uhm, my parents have been saying to me, being the eldest daughter, that you have to, you're a role model to your younger brother and sister, and how could you be leaving the family, and dividing everybody, ah, then, you're, you're doing this for yourself, you're being very selfish. 

00:06:05
LIANNE KOKI Selfish. 

00:06:05
SHELLY SAVAGE So, I'm hearing, there are few things that are standing out for me, uhm, saving face... (crosstalk) 

00:06:10
MELODY S. FO Great, good. 

00:06:10
SHELLY SAVAGE That's something that, ah, is, is very, different from my experience, I think. Uhm, so, saving face. Can you tell me more about what it, what it's like and what it feels like to save face? 

00:06:25
MELODY S. FO Excellent. 

00:06:25
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uhm, well, as far as I know, it's, it's kind of like bringing honor to your family and not bringing, that you represent your entire family, not only yourself as an individual. 

00:06:35
SHELLY SAVAGE Uh hmm. 

00:06:35
LIANNE KOKI Not supporting. 

00:06:35
MELODY S. FO She's giving you a chance. (crosstalk) 

00:06:35
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO So there is lots of burden and there's a, (crosstalk) 

00:06:40
MELODY S. FO Express yourself. 

00:06:40
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO a lot of pressure... (crosstalk) 

00:06:40
SHELLY SAVAGE Uh hmm. 

00:06:40
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO ...to represent the family. 

00:06:40
SHELLY SAVAGE  Uh hmm. 

00:06:45
LIANNE KOKI Lots of pressure. 

00:06:45
SHELLY SAVAGE And so, the burden and pressure, ah, I imagine, it is very difficult to find your own voice 'coz there's so many others that you have... (crosstalk) 

00:06:55
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Yeah, (crosstalk) 

00:06:55
SHELLY SAVAGE ...to speak for. 

00:06:55
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO  yeah. Uh-huh. 

00:07:00
MELODY S. FO Exactly. She understands. (crosstalk) 

00:07:00
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO I'm, I'm glad you said that. To be able to, to speak my voice and to, uhm, have that position in the family, because I, I felt that my parents have always taking precedence in what their wash, wishes and needs and, uhm, have always overshadowed my own. 

00:07:15
SHELLY SAVAGE Uh hmm. 

00:07:15
LIANNE KOKI You're so independent. 

00:07:20
SHELLY SAVAGE I imagine, uhm, the saving face is ah, my, my culture doesn't have that as a notion. Uhm, very, uhm, at least my experience, has been to be independent. Uhm, and I imagine that's the difference between our experiences. (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:07:40
SHELLY SAVAGE In terms of saving face, ah, does it, do you, do you feel about at certain times, like when you're anxious, you need to save face? 

00:07:50
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uh hmm. I think a lot of that comes from, from the anxiety. 

00:07:55
MELODY S. FO She gets in. 

00:07:55
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO You know, that... (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
LIANNE KOKI She's speaking for you. 

00:07:55
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO ...uhm, uhm, that my, the pressure over my family is always, is always following me wherever I am. It's kind of like there, it's a weight that I feel on my shoulder, and... (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
SHELLY SAVAGE Uh hmm. 

00:08:10
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO ...I think that's been adding to all this anxiety and, and, uhm, (inaudible ) inside had been happen. 

00:08:16
LIANNE KOKI Too much inside you. 

00:08:16
MELODY S. FO She trusts you, she's opening up.

00:08:40
SHELLY SAVAGE Uh hmm. 

00:08:40

Debriefing Interview #1 by Paul B. Pedersen 

00:08:55
PAUL B. PEDERSEN  Shelly, ah, what did you feel about this interview? How was it different by having a pro and an anti standing there, giving you a feedback on what your internal dialogue and the client's internal dialogue? 

00:09:10
SHELLY SAVAGE Ah, definitely, uhm, there was a lot to negotiate, uhm, in trying to find the, the stream of our conversation, and yet have it be informed by both the anti and the procounselor. Ah, and, and, I'm, I, I definitely felt that, ah, listening to both helped me understand and communicate better with Noela, the client. 

00:09:40
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Can you remember any explicit messages that the anti gave that caught your attention that you were able to use in working with Noela? 

00:09:45
SHELLY SAVAGE  Ah, it's gotta be, when you're black. Ah. (crosstalk) 

00:09:50
PAUL B. PEDERSEN That is a big one, huh? 

00:09:50
SHELLY SAVAGE Yes, because not often do I hear that, and, (laughs) and, ah, it, and, ah, it's, it, it's, it's off-putting, uhm, and, and I felt myself the nervousness of... (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:10:05
SHELLY SAVAGE ...ah, that, that it generated. And yet I knew that it was, uhm, it was important for us to be able to discuss it. 

00:10:10
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:10:10
PAUL B. PEDERSEN How about what the procounselor said? What, can you, ah, were any of those messages, did they help you work with the client? 

00:10:20
SHELLY SAVAGE It was encouraging to hear when I, ah, made contact with Noela. (crosstalk) 

00:10:25
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:10:25
SHELLY SAVAGE And that's what the procounselor, ah, allows, uhm, sort of gave me, uhm, yeah, I guess it, it was, it was very encouraging and supportive. 

00:10:35
SHELLY SAVAGE  Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
SHELLY SAVAGE but specifically, I don't remember what she said. 

00:10:40
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Okay. Noela, what was your feeling? How did you, how did you experience the, working with Shelly as the counselor? 

00:10:45
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uhm, I think Shelly did a great job. She helped me to feel comfortable, and I think that, that anticounselor brought to life very early on in the session, which would probably not be the case about the, the cultural difference, ah, you being black. I would've been, ah, more reluctant to actually have brought it up, but she gave me the voice and... (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:11:05
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO ...the courage to do so. 

00:11:05
PAUL B. PEDERSEN  Okay. 

00:11:10
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:11:10
PAUL B. PEDERSEN The role of the procounselor, what was your reaction? I'm sorry. Procounselor, what was your reaction? 

00:11:15
MELODY S. FO I thought they had a really good collaborative effort going in and early on brought to light what was really salient with the different cultures, uhm, however, I wanted to point out to both of them that they do have some commonalities as well... (crosstalk) 

00:11:25
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:11:25
MELODY S. FO ...such as that they're both women. 

00:11:30
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:11:30
MELODY S. FO Uh hmm. 

00:11:30
PAUL B. PEDERSEN And the anti, the devil? 

00:11:30
LIANNE KOKI (laughs) I thought it was a great experience that the, what I was sharing about their differences and about, uhm, especially the cultural differences were nicely played out in the session, but you addressing that right away, and I thought it actually enhanced the session. 

00:11:50
PAUL B. PEDERSEN So as you watched this session, try to imagine that this is, uhm, the procounselor is like an angel, and the anticounselor like a devil, and they're getting, giving you and giving one another a message of what they think the client and the counselor are thinking but not saying. We'll move on to the next interview.

NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Okay. 

00:16:25
JARRETT M. HORIBATA Yeah. 

00:16:25
LIANNE KOKI  You want her to be dependent on you? 

00:16:30
MELODY S. FO I think this is gonna work out. 

00:16:30
JARRETT M. HORIBATA I'm thinking like at times that, uhm, usually, it might be helpful if we talk about what this whole process is like, counseling, since you've said this is your very first time. 

00:16:40
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uh hmm, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
JARRETT M. HORIBATA Yeah. And I don't know if that's the direction you wanna go in or you do wanna take another direction?

MELODY S. FO Nice collaboration. 

00:16:45
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO  Hmm. I don't know. Uhm, what, what do you think would be the. (crosstalk) 

00:16:50

Debriefing Interview #2 by Paul B. Pedersen 

00:17:05
PAUL B. PEDERSEN  Ah, Jarrett how was this different with the pro and anti giving you feedback about what you and Noela were thinking but not saying? 

00:17:15
JARRETT M. HORIBATA  For me, it was really good because I could get immediate feedback to some of the things that might have been going on in her head and then respond right in session, in the moment. 

00:17:25
PAUL B. PEDERSEN  Can you remember any of the things that any of the pro and anti said? 

00:17:30
JARRETT M. HORIBATA Yeah. Well, anti was talking about control, uhm, talking about her emotional feelings, ah, some of the cultural issues, and then she was further reinforcing that when I did address things then I felt like, "Okay, I'm going in a right direction, this is how it should be approaching this client." Of the many possibilities, this might be a good way. 

00:17:50
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Great. 

00:17:50
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:17:50
PAUL B. PEDERSEN  Uhm, can you think of any specific time when you were able to pick a word or a phrase, keyword and use it a number of, at the beginning, you did something like that. I can't remember what the word was that you used. Can you, can you think of, uhm, of an example where you used something they said in the case of Noela? 

00:18:10
JARRETT M. HORIBATA  Co, I think, one thing, ah, what were some of the words that you're telling me at the very beginning about the guy being a... (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
LIANNE KOKI Uh hmm. 

00:18:20
JARRETT M. HORIBATA (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:18:21
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Yeah, that was one. 

00:18:21
JARRETT M. HORIBATA ...you have a different gender and that sort of thing, that's something that I picked up immediately. Uhm, and so I felt like Noela and I should be talking about that from the get-go. 

00:18:30
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Are you gonna be able to, ah, internalize this pro and the anti so that later in another interview with the client, where there're only two of you in the room, that you be able to have part of your mind being the pro and part of your mind being the anti? 

00:18:40
JARRETT M. HORIBATA I think the more I practice it, the more that it would be second nature for me, (crosstalk) 

00:18:45
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Good. 

00:18:45
JARRETT M. HORIBATA I think it is something that you can pick up. 

00:18:50
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Good. 

00:18:50
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:18:50
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Well we're helping to accomplish through these training videos, is demonstrating a model where the counselor later on will be able to internalize both what the anti is saying and the pro is saying and be able to monitor those three conversations at the same time as they're doing counseling.

MELODY S. FO Great. This is your chance.

00:20:35
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO  Yeah, they're, they're very dear to my heart and, uhm, what they think about and how they, how they, how they feel about my, my future is very important to me, that's why I'm feeling very torn between kinda venturing out of my own and developing my career and doing what's best for me versus what's best for the family and they...

PAUL B. PEDERSEN  What do you remember from what the procounselor and the anticounselor said that you were able to use working with Noela? 

00:24:15
KIMBERLY S. WAGNER I know I directly used something that the procounselor said in terms of, uhm, I forgot now what the exact thing. It was something about, about pride or, or what does that mean for Noela. So, I think I directly and something but I think it's seems that you're having more information to work with. 

00:24:30
PAUL B. PEDERSEN  Did you see any advantage or disadvantage when you were being from, ah, Caucasian and Noela as being Japanese American? 

00:24:40
KIMBERLY S. WAGNER Uhm, I think there's advantage and disadvantage to every counseling situation. Uhm, hopefully in my work as a white counselor, I try to understand other people's viewpoints from their not coming from a white cultural background and I think that's always an advantage. Uhm, the disadvantage is, yeah, I don't understand all the, the, uhm, kind of unspoken rule... (crosstalk)

PAUL B. PEDERSEN Would that deliberate, that you were nailing(ph) when you saw Kimberly... (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
LIANNE KOKI  Yes. 

00:26:05
PAUL B. PEDERSEN ...to be more independent and you saw Noela as maybe wanting to be more independent and you were saying. 

00:26:05
LIANNE KOKI  Yes, that that was an issue that I, you'd see it there. And that I wasn't quite sure that it was being... (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:26:10
LIANNE KOKI  Addressed... (crosstalk) 

00:26:15
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:26:15
KIMBERLY S. WAGNER Uh hmm. 

00:26:15
LIANNE KOKI Enough. 

00:26:15
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:26:15
LIANNE KOKI So, yeah. 

00:26:15
KIMBERLY S. WAGNER Okay. 

00:26:15
PAUL B. PEDERSEN  As a pro, what did you pick up on from this interview? 

00:26:20
MELODY S. FO I picked up on the facts that they were, ah, coming from very different places that they were initially understanding certain issues like pride from very different points of views... (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
KIMBERLY S. WAGNER Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
MELODY S. FO ...but I think at the end they really worked on, uhm, Kimberly allowed Noela to really express her uniqueness and her individuality... (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Yeah. 

00:26:40
MELODY S. FO ...and how her culture creates that and I think that they were able to come to an understanding by the end of the session because she has(ph) others(ph) to do that. 

00:26:45
PAUL B. PEDERSEN  Good. A lot of the counseling that goes on occurs between a Caucasian counselor and minority client. What we're trying to do in this particular five-minute brief interview is demonstrate some of the dynamics that are occurring in the internal dialogue, both of the client and of the counselor, both positive and negative and relate to these cultural differences.

NOELA S. YAMAMOTO  Well, uhm, I'm the eldest of three children. I have a younger brother and sister and, ah, my parents, uhm, have always instilled me in, in family values in doing what's best for the family. And now that I'm, what I'm doing is I believe is best for me, uhm, they're seeing it as a betrayal. 

00:28:30
MELODY S. FO Family values is best for the family. (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
LIANNE KOKI He's closed off. His hands are closed. 

00:28:35
GERARDO TORRES Why don't you tell me a little bit more about, ah, your family values or what you think your family values are? 

00:28:40
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO  Uhm, well, kind of that you, you brought the family thing and, and, uhm, I was just kinda wondering, being that we're from different cultural backgrounds and different genders and, uhm, if you can really understand and help me to understand my situation. 

00:29:00
GERARDO TORRES Well, I can try to understand that, ah, ah, maybe if I can get a description of what your role is in your family or how the order goes between siblings and... (crosstalk)

NOELA S. YAMAMOTO And, uhm, so I've, my parents always look to me as being the role model and setting the bar for the family and, uhm, they feel now that I'm, I'm not living up to that role. 

00:29:35

00:29:50
LIANNE KOKI But is it the same obligation? 

00:29:50
GERARDO TORRES  Tell me where some of your feelings are coming from. You have a sense of obligation. You feel, ah, ah, there are sort of things that you have to do or maybe your family's expecting you to do. 

00:30:05
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:30:05
GERARDO TORRES Uhm, how about you, what do you feel? Ah, what, what are you trying to do? Ah, moving away, you're trying to.

GERARDO TORRES So it sounds like you wanted to be a little independent or maybe move away from your family, ah, three hours a week, maybe that's not too far away. Ah, just far enough, ah... 

00:30:35

00:31:20
GERARDO TORRES What does that mean for you, ah, to be a good daughter? 

00:31:20
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO  Uhm, it means I have a lot of obligations... (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
GERARDO TORRES Uh hmm. (nods) 

00:31:25
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO To the family, to do what's best for the family and to uphold that. 

00:31:30
GERARDO TORRES Hmm. 

00:31:30
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO The honor, the duty, and, uhm, I feel, why can't I do that away from home?

GERARDO TORRES Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO ...they don't see it as, as being that. And, uhm, the sadness is coming from they're not being happy for my own decisions.

00:32:10
Debriefing Interview #4 by Paul B. Pedersen 

00:32:10
PAUL B. PEDERSEN  Gerry, how did this feel with a pro and an anti sitting here, giving you cues about what your internal dialogue and Noela's internal dialogue might have been saying? 

00:32:30
GERARDO TORRES (sighs) It felt really helpful. Ah, we're setting two, ah, two sides of a story or two sides of a book. Ah, I, I didn't really pick up any, ah, cultural cues or, or any other cues. But as I kind of listen to both of them, it was really helpful... (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:32:45
GERARDO TORRES ...to see how I might have been misinterpreting, ah, my words or, ah, misreading some of the words that she was giving me. So I thought it was really helpful. 

00:32:50
PAUL B. PEDERSEN  Can you think of any particular words or sentences that either of them said that were, that you were able to use? I saw you doing that a number of times. 

00:33:00
GERARDO TORRES Ah, I think, ah, when the word, ah, independence was... (crosstalk) 

00:33:05
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:33:05
GERARDO TORRES ...used. Uhm, the family values was used. I picked up, ah, pretty strongly, and... (crosstalk) 

00:33:10
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:33:10
GERARDO TORRES ...I really tried to say something about that. Ah, another time when feelings were mentioned, I really wanted to mention the feelings. 

00:33:15
PAUL B. PEDERSEN How typical would this be of an interview with a Hispanic counselor, let's say a Hispanic male counselor... (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
GERARDO TORRES Uh hmm. 

00:33:20
PAUL B. PEDERSEN  and another minority, say that Asian-American, Japanese-American female client? 

00:33:25
GERARDO TORRES  (sighs) I think, ah, I would probably have, what about how her role was, was affecting, ah, her, her judgment. Uhm, maybe, ah, seeing her as, ah, being independent maybe it's, ah, a little bit of fault in the family and in her, (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:33:50
GERARDO TORRES ah, just a little bit of fault on both sides. Maybe if, ah, ah, uhm, she couldn't gains to a compromise... 

00:34:00
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:34:00
GERARDO TORRES ...with the family. To be a little less independent and let the family let her be a little more independent, that would've been a solution. 

00:34:05
PAUL B. PEDERSEN  Noela, what was your feeling? Where did you see this interview going? 

00:34:10
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Tsk, uhm, I thought that Gerry helped me feel more at ease. (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:34:15
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uhm, and he's really keen upon the cues. I think I would like to have explored more of the culture... (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:34:20
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO ...aspects. 

00:34:20
PAUL B. PEDERSEN What, when you say more of the culture, what kind of culture aspects would you want to explore? 

00:34:25
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uhm, well, one has brought it up at the beginning about the interview being from different cultures and different genders. (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:34:30
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO He wanted to, uhm, really hear out, you know, the, more about the family situation. We kinda went to that and we got. (crosstalk) 

00:34:35
PAUL B. PEDERSEN okay. Family and cultures is what you're talking about? 

00:34:35
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Yeah. Uh-huh. 

00:34:40
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:34:40
PAUL B. PEDERSEN How's the anti, what, ah, was your experience working with Gerry here, inside his head? 

00:34:45
LIANNE KOKI Uhm, I felt that there was a family being brought forth. Ah, but I also felt that there might be differences even among those lines, even though family is important, it might be or have a different feel from, ah, a Japanese American standpoint and to a Hispanic standpoint. And I wanted that to be brought forth a little bit more. 

00:35:05
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Excellent. And from a pro-counselor's perspective? 

00:35:10
MELODY S. FO I thought that Gerry was very respective and I think he started with their common backrounds of both having families that are both important to them and he felt some of that. And from there, he started trying to tell him the differences between his culture values with his family goals and Noela's. 

00:35:25
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. No matter how different the client is from you, there will always be similarities. And no matter how similar the client is, there will have always be differences. What Gerry was able to do in this interview, as identify areas worth picking out of the pro and the anti, is identify areas of common ground that they could build on and use the typical, conventional counseling skills but use them within the context, the cultural context that they were both were in(ph). 

00:35:55
Counseling Interview #5 by Paul B. Pedersen 

00:35:55
PAUL B. PEDERSEN  Hi, Noela. I'm glad to see you today. Uhm, can you tell me a little bit about what you're thinking when you come in here?

00:36:15
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh-huh.

NOELA S. YAMAMOTO  Ever. 

00:36:25

00:36:25
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Oh, that must make you very anxious. 

00:36:25

00:36:25
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Yeah. 

00:36:25
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO ...I'm, I'm nervous right now. (crosstalk)

00:36:30
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO My hands are also little sweaty, in fact, yeah. 

00:36:30
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Is there anything I can do that will make that anxiety less? 

00:36:35
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO  Uhm, well, maybe since you brought it up, uhm, I'm just a little curious because there is the, the age differential... (crosstalk) 

00:36:45
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:36:45
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO ...and the, the gender... (crosstalk) 

00:36:45
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:36:45
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO And the cultures, so... (crosstalk)

00:36:50
MELODY S. FO Great, he's concerned. Good. She felt supported. 

00:36:50
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Yeah. I am concerned. I am concerned that we find common ground so that we can work together and, ah, that your level of anxiety will go down. That's what my hope is. 

00:37:00
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uh hmm. Yes, as we're talking, it is, it is going down. (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Good, good. (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
LIANNE KOKI But you still don't trust him. 

00:37:05
PAUL B. PEDERSEN It's hard to trust older male, so many differences? 

00:37:10
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:37:10
PAUL B. PEDERSEN  We'll work on that. 

00:37:15
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uh hmm. Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:37:15
MELODY S. FO Great. Good. (crosstalk) 

00:37:15
LIANNE KOKI A lot of differences. 

00:37:15
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Yeah. 

00:37:15
MELODY S. FO He wants to work with you. 

00:37:15
PAUL B. PEDERSEN So, what kind of problems are you facing that make you anxious besides being... (crosstalk) 

00:37:20
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:37:20
PAUL B. PEDERSEN ...here and talking to me? 

00:37:20
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO (laughs) Well, ah, my family always said not to, uhm, go on to the community in share... (crosstalk) 

00:37:30
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh-huh. 

00:37:30
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO (inaudible ) that was going on. So they thought element(ph) and also about, uhm, me moving... (crosstalk) 

00:37:35
PAUL B. PEDERSEN I guess. 

00:37:35
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO ...two hours away. And, ah, being 25 years old and also being at home, uhm, being from a more protective family, I'm, I'm having some difficulty for that. 

00:37:45
LIANNE KOKI He's not gonna understand. (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
MELODY S. FO What's so hard to share? (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
PAUL B. PEDERSEN So, your family believes that you should stay closer to home and be part of the larger family? 

00:37:50
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Yeah. 

00:37:50
PAUL B. PEDERSEN And, sort of your role, that they did it, their grandparents did it and their great grandparents did it and now it's your turn. 

00:37:55
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO  Right, right. Exactly. (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
LIANNE KOKI If you'd just be independent. 

00:38:00
MELODY S. FO Precisely. Right. (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
PAUL B. PEDERSEN And that's really hard for you because you're getting a lot of pressure from peers to be independent and a lot of pressure from your family to stay traditional. 

00:38:05
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO  Yeah, I'm, I'm being torn in both directions. 

00:38:10
PAUL B. PEDERSEN So, no matter which choice you make, you're going to get criticized. 

00:38:15
LIANNE KOKI Is he talking for you today? 

00:38:15
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Right, exactly. 

00:38:15
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Yeah. That makes it really difficult. (crosstalk) 

00:38:20
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Yeah. It is. It's making me reconsider even moving away. 

00:38:20
PAUL B. PEDERSEN  What, how can, how can we find a win-win outcome to this? How can we find a way that you can satisfy your family... (crosstalk) 

00:38:30
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Hmm. 

00:38:30
PAUL B. PEDERSEN And still not get criticized by your peers? 

00:38:30
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO  I don't know. I, I'm really kind of attended my role, by, I've been thinking about it and asking other people and I just don't know what to do. 

00:38:40
LIANNE KOKI Isn't he supposed to solve your problem? 

00:38:40
MELODY S. FO  She's relaxing. She's opening up. 

00:38:45
LIANNE KOKI No. (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uh hmm, maybe you can help me get some insight. 

00:38:45
PAUL B. PEDERSEN What have you tried so far? What have you tried in, as you thought of the problem... (crosstalk) 

00:38:50
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:38:50
PAUL B. PEDERSEN You've probably come up with some different ways of dealing with it. What are some of the ways that, that you've already considered... (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO Uh hmm. 

00:38:55
PAUL B. PEDERSEN ...in dealing with the problem? 

00:38:55
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO  Well, I thought of getting a place, you know, at my, in the new town... (crosstalk) 

00:39:00
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:39:00
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO ...and working there and coming back on the weekends. But that's a six-hour commute. 

00:39:05
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Yeah that's, uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO That's too much. And, uhm, I thought about maybe, uhm, taking that job and seeing what it's like and then maybe after a year, considering moving back. 

00:39:15
PAUL B. PEDERSEN Uh hmm. 

00:39:15
NOELA S. YAMAMOTO But this, this is a great opportunity. I don't wanna give it up.
