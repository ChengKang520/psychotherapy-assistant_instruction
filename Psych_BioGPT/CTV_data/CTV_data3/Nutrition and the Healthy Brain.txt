Aims Brain metabolism and function. Maintaining and enhancing function. Mental health treatment and supplementation for mental health problems. 

00:00:00
Why would nutrients affect our brains? Nutrients serve a variety of functions including: Energy metabolism Neurotransmitter function Maintenance of healthy mood Protection and growth of neural structures Up or down regulation of genes involved in healthy brain metabolism. 

00:00:00
Foundation 1: looking after our brains and preventing cognitive decline Looking after our brains involves optimal nutrition. The old saying that you are what you eat is most true for our brains. The sad reality is that many people begin to show cognitive changes that are related to decline by the time they enter their 30s. The quality of food we ingest might significantly reduce our risk of age related negative neurological changes. 

00:00:00
Genes and nutrition While some say genes might predict conditions like Alzheimer's disease, the reality is that genes only explain up to 30% of our risk for any disease. This means that up to 70% of our chance of getting a disease is explained by our lifestyle, health behaviour and living environment. Of course the relationship between genes and environment is oversimplified by this statistic, but the principle is that our health environment is something we have a lot of control over is sound. 

00:00:00
Energy metabolism a double edged sword Our brains are less than 2% of our body weight however they use 20% of our body's oxygen and 20% of its blood. It probably generates enough energy to power a small light bulb. Our brains burn energy like coal at a power station, and in the same way generates large amounts of toxic byproducts that must be disposed of by the body, of course our brains prefer to burn glucose to make energy. We slowly accumulate damage to our neurons and neural maintenance systems due to the wear and tear of brain metabolism over time. The older we get the more our brains accumulate damage because the brain is so metabolically active. 

00:00:00
The negative byproducts of energy metabolism are oxidation and glycation that damage cells, and produce low to high levels of inflammation that slowly damage neural tissue down regulating optimal gene expression Oxidation pathway Glycation pathway Do antioxidants work as we have been led to believe? The brain does not have the same protective mechanisms as other areas of the body because the blood brain barrier restricts lots of potentially protective nutrients from reaching our precious neural tissue. However, very small molecule nutrients can get across the blood brain barrier. The blood brain barrier consists of tightly packed cells to protect our brains from chemicals and pathogens in our blood. 

00:00:00
Even our own immune response in the brain can cause inflammation that can damage our neurons. Inflammation and brain tissue don't mix, just think of all the damage done by a concussion and the consequences of brain swelling. Chronic inflammation of neural tissue is thought to be a foundational pathogenic process in the development of Alzheimer's disease by allowing the expression of TAU proteins and the accumulation of beta amyloid plaques in neurons. 

00:00:00
Other reactions such as excitosis where neurons file uncontrollably until they die is thought to be related to low levels of neural inflammation or toxic chemicals in our food. Common examples of food related excitotoxins are some preservatives, flavor enhancers and artificial sweeteners that overstimulate glutamate receptors. These also stimulate genes to express inflammatory immune and cytokine responses. 

00:00:00
However, there are different classes of nutrients, chemicals and hormones can cross the blood brain barrier and serve important protective functions. E.g. higher levels of our own natural steroid hormones and various androgens appear associated with better cognitive and memory function and better mood than low levels in older people. 

00:00:00
This is part of the reason that cognitive function declines with age. Bio identical hormone replacement has been found to improve cognitive function, memory and mental health in older adults. Anabolic hormones likely stimulate brain growth factors. This might be another reason why exercise is important as it might stimulate these classes of hormones. 

00:00:00
Foundation 2: nutrition Certain antioxidant nutrients that cross the blood brain barrier appear very neuroprotective reducing damage created by metabolism, waste products, excitotoxic reactions and modifying inflammatory reactions. The good news is that we can do a lot with diet and nutrition of support our brains to cope with the stresses of metabolism and protect our precious neurons. 

00:00:00
What to do to keep our brains healthy Watch the sugar in the diet: Our brains need carbohydrate to run efficiently, it is in fact the preferred fuel. While we need adequate glucose for our brains to function well, more is not better, we simply need enough. Our brains are very sensitive to blood glucose levels, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) almost immediately affects the brain resulting in drowsiness, slurring of speech, trouble concentrating, and in the worst case unconsciousness and even death. 

00:00:00
What to do to keep our brains healthy Elevated blood sugar (hyperglycemia) is also a problem and indicate reduced insulin sensitivity or diabetes, meaning that our precious neurons and other cells might not be getting adequate glucose uptake. What happens to the elevated blood glucose as it washes past every cell in our body? Two things: the first is it creates higher levels of glycation than normal, where glucose fuses with proteins and cells as we discussed before. Secondly, elevated glucose that is not burned up by our cells is converted into triglycerides, (a form of blood fat) leading to elevate blood levels of this lipid and weight gain. So does all this mean that skipping meals and snacking on sweets all day is a problem and can potentially elevate glucose levels and create health problems in the long term? You bet it does! Our brains also need a constant supply of amino acids as these are used as neurotransmitters and as building blocks for other neurotransmitters. Poor and overly processed diets lack the essential nutrients to protect and create optimal brain function. 

00:00:00
What to do to keep our brains healthy Ensure enough protein in the diet, from plant, nuts, animal or dairy sources. Protein will supply amino acids. Get enough nutrition. When our cells burn glucose it requires oxygen which generates free radicals (unbalanced reaction between atoms) which damage our the delicate membranes and the micromachinery of our cells. Our bodies make antioxidant and anti-glycation chemicals. These are abundant in youth, but decline rapidly as one gets older. These natural systems have their limits, particularly in the brain. They are easily overwhelmed by poor diet, stress and poor health behaviours. These endogenous systems also require nutrients to work properly. As our endogenous systems decline with age the role of nutrition becomes more important to get these protective chemicals and provide optimal protection to our nervous system. Don't eat too much; huge meals cause rapid increases in blood fats and blood sugar and can be part of postprandial lipidemia (excessive rise in triglyceride rich lipoproteins after eating), which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and as some suggest also diabetes. Same can happen for post meal glucose. Narrowed arteries can also mean less blood for our brains. 

00:00:00
Foundation 3: Dietary and supplement neuroprotection Some super foods full of potent antioxidants that will protect your brain are blueberries, and most other berries, all have compounds called polyphenolics. Also found in smaller amounts in fruit, vegetables and nuts. They are antioxidant and anti-inflammatory and inhibit proteins involved with signalling neuron death and upregulate neuron function and health. Grape seed extract is an antioxidant that improves blood vessel function and tone in the brain, as well as a neuroantioxidant, brain levels raise over time with ongoing supplementation. 

00:00:00
Dietary and supplement neuroprotection Gingko biloba, antioxidant that also supports healthy blood flow in the brain. Curomin (found in tumeric) antioxidant and anti-glycating agent that is a potent down regulator of genes involved with inflammation. Blueberries appear to improve neurogenesis, improve function in old malfunctioning neurons, improve neural connections and neurons functions, via regulating genes involved with cell function and fluid balance. Uridine 5'-monophosphate, a phosphatide building block of RNA-DNA supports brain growth and neuroplasticity. Vincocentine, a herb which improves neural electrical conductivity in neurons and protect against excitotoxicity. 

00:00:00
Dietary and supplement neuroprotection Ashwagandha, a plant that inhibits acetylcholine reuptake, improving memory and concentration. Likewise some vitamins such as E, the B group vitamin Choline (acytolcholine precursor for memory) and phosphatidylserine (supports memory and neuroplasticity by supporting neuron function and structure). Alpha lipoic acid (an antioxidant and anti-glycation nutrient) is very neuro protective reducing inflammation and damage and stimulating neurotransmitters involved with learning, memory and mood. Omega 3 typically sourced from fish oil reduces inflammatory processes in the brain and protects it from toxic reactions. Support mood and memory. In fact our neural tissues prefer omega 3 and preferentially take these up from the blood stream into cell membranes. Acetyl-L-carnitine arginate is an example of a supplement which has been shown to stimulate neural growth factor increasing the length and thickness of dendrites in the brain. 

00:00:00
Dietary and supplement neuroprotection CoQ10, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) support energy metabolism and are potent antioxidants. PQQ may protect against neurological disorders and dementia and enhance memory via stimulating growth factors. Low levels of vit D3 is linked to cognitive decline and can predict Parkinson's disease. The vitamin hormone D3 is shaping up as an essential supplement for health. B6, B12 and folic acid slow brain atrophy in mildly cognitively impaired adults, via reduced homocysteine levels. Long term antioxidant supplementation improves arterial health, and insulin sensitivity. There are many more brain friendly nutrients and it is worth learning more about these and how to add them to your diet. 

00:00:00
Foundation 4: Depression Some big news For some people applying the principles already discussed will dramatically improve mood, others may need more specialized intervention. That natural compound S. Anenosyl Methionine (SAMe) may be equally effective as prescribed medications for depression and it is a brain antioxidant as well. It may be useful for treatment resistant depression, one study showed when taken in addition to prescription medication it doubled the remission rate compared to those on medication alone within a 6 week period. An Australian study, Bambling (2013), demonstrated 800 mg a day of SAMe in addition to SSRIs more than double the remission rate in resistant depression. Important finding as antidepressant medications do not work on at least 30% of patients and mixed effectiveness on another 30%. 

00:00:00
Depression SAMe is made from natural amino acids and supports monamine synthesis by affecting gene expression i.e. methylation which seems to regulate growth factors and neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine involved with mood. Endogenous levels lower in depressed people. Drugs work to reduce reuptake of e.g. Serotonin where as SAMe stimulates the production of serotonin. May stimulate and protect acytelcholine production. Low levels may be implicated in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Supports brain anticaldent systems. Should be taken with B group vitamins as co-factors. 

00:00:00
Depression Saffron extract. Has strong anti-depressive effect on par with pharmaceutics. Modulates serogeneric receptors in the brain, supporting mood, increasing motivation and sense of positive mental energy. Strong impact on desire to eat and hunger. Used as adjunct for assisting weight loss where there are significant emotional causes. L-tryptophan; precursor to serotonin and melatonin. May improve mood and quality of sleep. Uridine may be the next big thing in treating depression and a variety of mental health disorders due to its favorable modulation of mitochondrial function and cell membrane signaling. 

00:00:00
Depression Omega 3 supplements have been shown to be helpful for some people with depression, learning problems and hyperactivity. However results for individuals may vary. St. Johns' Wort is a weak MAO (monoamino oxidase) inhibitor and weak reuptake inhibitor of serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline, influences GABA and L-glutamate, and reduces the expression of interleukin-6. Best not to use St. Johns' Wort with anti-depressants. 

00:00:00
Anxiety Anxiety can be a disorder in own right, but also can be comorbid, and/or related to symptom severity in a host of mental health problems. Anxiety disorders have nearly three times the prevalence of depression in the western world. Meds: temporary fix, problems are tolerance and side effects. SSRIs have gained popularity as a front line anxiety medication, increases serotonin in synapses. Benzos: stimulate GABA receptors. 

00:00:00
For generalised anxiety Glutamate (accelerates) and GABA (inhibits) account for over 80% of brain activity. Work in harmony to keep brain activity optimal. Anxiety problems suggest an imbalance, too much glutamate or too little GABA. Too much glutamate can cause excitotoxic reactions and might be linked to the development of neurodegenerative disorders. 

00:00:00
Norepinephrine & Dopamine Nor. Increases alertness and arousal, great for sports, not for social functioning. Involved with panic attacks. Dop. More complex, can increase anxiety when levels are too high but is anxiety protective in the right amounts, increases motivation and experience of pleasure. Often needs boosting, especially if anxiety symptoms are accompanied by negativity, apathy, fatigue, can't loose weight, no pleasure, poor sex drive. 

00:00:00
Serotonin Wide range of functions from sleep, appetite, to impulse control and sexual desire. Can be calming and protects against cortisol. Not everyone will feel good when they have high levels of serotonin. May be low if anxiety is accompanied by low mood, insomnia, carb cravings, muscle aches and pains, impulsiveness, insecurity and poor stress tolerance. 

00:00:00
Cortisol Important part of our stress response, without it our physiology wouldn't continue to work. Chronically elevation creates a host of health and neurological problems. 

00:00:00
My pick for Anxiety & Sleep L-Theanine, a natural amino acid and found in high concentrations in green tea. Effective as medication for treating anxiety in doses above 200 mg per day with none of the side effects of tranquilizers; it even enhances concentration and memory. Increases serotonin and dopamine levels, and blocks the binding of L-glutamic acid to glutamate receptors. Promotes alpha brain waves, a relaxed brain state. The herb Lemon Balm can improve the quality of sleep for most people between 20-40% with no sedative effect the next day. May also improve concentration by modulating nicotinic and muscaninic receptors in the cortex. Can also be used to help smokers quit. 

00:00:00
Something new for OCD and Panic N-acetyle cystein (NAC) as a treatment to prevent liver damage in acetaminophen and other substance overdose. Modulates glutamate/GABA balance and found useful for the full spectrum of obsessive compulsive disorders, gambling, trichotillomania (hair pulling). Inositol reduces general anxiety, panic and OCD like symptoms. Found to be equally as effective SSRIs for panic attack without significant side effects. Concerns over use with bipolar people due to one report of worsening manic symptoms. 

00:00:00
Taurine calms the brain via Glycine/GABA. Glutamate protective. Can cause drowsiness and mildly lower blood pressure, take before bed. Taurine is involved with numerous physiological processes. DHEA if you can get it. Pregnenolone is available off script, but check your blood levels. Both are good for anxiety and also cortisol protective. 

00:00:00
Psychosis One theory is defective genes result in oxidized adrenaline hormone, creating adrenochrome. High dose niacin and Vit C reduce adrenaline production and oxidization with good results on symptoms for some people. Have liver function monitored. Fish oil, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) could help prevent the development of schizophrenia in teenagers and young adults, according to a promising study from Australia. Adding EPA to standard antipsychotic drug therapy may accelerate treatment response and improve the tolerability of antipsychotic medications in schizophrenia patients. 

00:00:00
Learning and memory L-theanine and Lemon balm. Ginkgo, vinpocetine (helps modulate neurotransmitters involved with attention and memory), phosphatidylserine supports NP Acetyl-L-Carnitine Arginate, Ashwanganda, Choline, blueberry neurochemical and neuron modulators. Pregnenolone, Rhodiola (herb) support energy production in neurons, good for older people. Omega 3, good for everything. 

00:00:00
Behaviour Problems & Addiction Omega 3 L-theanine and Lemon balm, Ginkgo, vinpocetine (helps modulate neurotransmitters involved with attention and memory), Phosphatidylserine, B group, folic acid, St. John's Wort. 

00:00:00
Weight loss Saffron extract, assist with emotional issues and food craving, shown to reduce desire to snack and 50% reduction in snacking between meals, better mood. Pinoleric acid, pine nut extract, increases hunger suppressing hormones, cholecystolinin (CCC) and glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) Reduces desire to eat by 36%. CLA conjugated linoleic acid, increase FA oxidization in liver, harder to gain weight, more weight loss when used in program preserves lean muscle during weight loss. Variety of fibers, carb and fat blockers can all help in weight reduction program. Can affect nutrient absorption. Thermogenics, can be of benefit. 

00:00:00
Foundation 5: One stop for mental health: Exercise Our brains like it when we do physical exercise. The old saying that a healthy body means a healthy mind is true. Sitting in front of a TV all day is not going to cut it for our brain. We need to get moving. Exercise has been shown to help symptoms in all types of mental health problems e.g. depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, addictions and so on. Exercise stimulates neural growth factors, the format of new neurons and stimulates dendritic connections to grow between neurons and enhance neurotransmitter levels. In areas of the brain involved in memory and learning and mood. 

00:00:00
One stop for mental health: Exercise All forms of exercise might be beneficial but aerobic exercise where the heart rate is raised appears best. While there is no conclusive proof in human research, high intensity exercise may be best when we are younger and moderate intensity aerobic type exercises from middle age onwards. Regular exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in old age so might help protect against Alzheimer's disease, depression and anxiety disorders and improve recovery from addictions. Exercise certainly modifies risk factors for most health problems such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, sarcopinia and stress which are all factors that in the long term might be involved with cognitive decline. 

00:00:00
Risks Nutritional and supplemental approaches have minimal side effects and are remarkably safe compared to prescription medications. The risks are that people often go it alone, taking the wrong supplements, stopping existing treatments or combining natural approaches with prescribed medications. Some mood regulating nutrients may interact with anti-depressants. Careful evaluation and monitoring is needed if treating mental health problems naturally. 

00:00:00
Forgotten culprits Health problems in mental disorders, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, heart disease, metabolic problems e.g. hormones. The most over looked is sleep disorder. Obstructive or central sleep apnea is underdiagnosed. Mild conditions are under treated. Strong associations with cerebral vascular disease and risk of stroke and cognitive degeneration, and demylenation diseases. Likely links with flair hyper intensities. Strong association with mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, poor memory, learning and concentration. Can cause elevated blood pressure and heart disease. A recent study shows the brain recovers to a significant degree with CPAP treatment. 

00:00:00
Conclusion Adopting a health brain lifestyle will have significant benefits for overall health and maintaining a healthy brain into old age. Consider adding specific dietary nutrients or supplements to upregulate genes involved with neurotransmitters and brain health and minimize the risk of cognitive decline or dementia. Consider specific supplements or compounds to assist with the treatment of mental health or behavioral problems. Don't forget to exercise. Do this under the guidance and supervision of an appropriate health practitioner. Do not encourage a go it alone approach. Ensure good quality sleep.

DR. MATTHEW BAMBLING Welcome everybody. I'm Doctor Matt Bambling and this presentation is on Nutrition and the Healthy Brain. It's a very interesting area of mental health practice. Right through from the whole side of prevention through the actual treatment of mental health problems nutritionally and with lifestyle changes. So I hope you enjoy the presentation today. The aims of this presentation, we're going to look at brain metabolism and function in the first part and maintaining and enhancing function, which we're all interested in as we get older, and supplementation for mental health problems. And that's using nutrients specifically to treat mental health issues. And the approaches I'm going to talk about today are evidenced based. There's a good deal of research for them. So why would nutrients affect our brains? Well, nutrients serve a variety of functions and are involved with a variety of co-functions in the brain. One of those is energy metabolism. And that's the production of energy and neurons to let them do what they need to do. Neurotransmitter function. Neurotransmitters have to be made out of things and nutrients provide the raw materials for that. Maintenance of healthy moods. Some nutrients have a specific effect on mood, usually through neurotransmitter modulation. And the protection and growth of neural structures and some nutrients protect our brains, their delicate neurons. And some stimulate the production of brain derived neurotrophic factor and other classes in neurotrophic factors involved with brain growth and development. At the core of this, and we'll look at this in a bit more detail, is the idea that nutrients, much like some medications either up-regulate or down-regulate various genes involved with brain metabolism. It's often the way they work. So Foundation One, looking after our brains and preventing cognitive decline. And as people are aware, cognitive decline is a very serious problem in our aging society. And so to look after our brains involves optimal nutrition. The old saying is that we are what we eat is most true for our brains. The sad reality is that many people start to show cognitive changes that are related to decline by the time they enter their thirties. So the quality of food we ingest might significantly reduce our risk of age-related neurological changes. So genes and nutrition. While some say genetics might predict conditions like Alzheimer's disease, the reality is that genes only ever explain about 30 percent of our risk for any disease. This means that up to 70 percent of our chance of getting any disease is explained by our lifestyle, health behavior and living environment. And of course the relationship between genes and environment is oversimplified by this statistic. Of course there's more to it than that. But the principle is a solid one, that health environment is something we have a lot of control over to minimize our risk. So energy metabolism in the brain, it's a double edged sword. Our brains are less than two percent of our body weight but they use about 20 percent of our body's oxygen and 20 percent of its blood. It probably generates enough electrical power to run a small light bulb. So brains burn energy like coal at a power station, and in the same way generates large amounts of toxic by-products that must be disposed of by the body. And of course our brains prefer to burn glucose to make energy. So we slowly accumulate damage to our neurons and neuron maintenance systems due to wear and tear of our brain, due to metabolism over time. The older we get the more our brains accumulate damage because the brain is so metabolically active. And we'll see that the capacity for the brain to manage this process and repair decreases with age as well. So what negative by-products of energy metabolism are oxidization and glycation that damage cells and that produce low to high levels of inflammation that slowly damage neural tissue and down-regulated optimal gene expression. So there's the oxidated pathway and the glycation pathway. The oxidated pathway is [00:04:450]where the atoms become unbalanced and they lose electrons. And the theory is that they cause cascades of electron imbalances in other atoms and it causes damage to cells and cell membranes. Is that true? Do anti-oxidants work in the way in which we've been led to believe? Well the answer is not really. They do to a point. You know, oxidization's absolutely essential for most metabolic processes. Without it we couldn't live. So nutrients to dampen oxidization to the point of making significant impacts in that process probably would make us sick. So dietary nutrients probably aren't strong enough to do that. They're certainly useful at the successive oxidization with illness and inflammation. However, more modern research is suggesting that antioxidants work a little differently. They certainly don't add electrons but they also have components that are involved in lots of different enzyme functions in the body. So that may be a pathway that works. But probably the most significant pathway is they modulate gene expression. So they're switching on genes which are good and switching off genes perhaps involved with excessive inflammation and other types of problems in the body. Glycation pathway, that's where glucose in the blood binds with proteins and cells. Into burn sugar reaction, like we burn sugar in the oven or if we overcook meat we get that burnt carmelized layer. That's a glycation reaction. Happens to our neurons over time and our cells in our body. We'll discuss the implication of this as we move through the presentation. But you probably can guess glycation's not good. The body doesn't cope well with it either. There's not a lot it can do to remove glycation reactions very easily. There's a lot we can do to stop them from happening though. So the brain does not have the same protective mechanisms as other areas of the body because the blood brain barrier restricts a lot of potentially protective nutrients from reaching our precious neural tissue. And they have a very small molecule, nutrients can cross the blood brain barrier. And the blood brain barrier consists of tightly packed cells in the blood vessels that feed into the brain. And it's there really to protect their brains from pathogens and unwanted things from entering in it because the neural system's so delicate. The downside is a lot of things can't get in unless they have a small enough molecular structure to pass through these tightly packed cells. So even our immune response in the brain can cause inflammation. And it can damage our neurons. And if you think about that inflammation and brain tissue just don't mix. Just think of the damage done by a concussion and the consequences in brain swelling. Neural tissue does not like inflammation. However as we said, inflammation is part of an immune response as well. So chronic inflammation of neural tissue is thought to be a foundational pathogenic process in the development of Alzheimer's disease by allowing the expression of TAU proteins and the accumulation of beta amyloid plaques in neurons. And that's certainly an important pathway. And the possibility the research is showing a link with excessive iron being stored in the brain as well is part of that process. So other reactions such as excitosis where neurons fire uncontrollably until they die is thought to be related to low levels of neural inflammations or toxic chemicals in our food. And that's where the neurons fire uncontrollably until they eventually die. It's as simple as that. And it's an important pathway of brain damage. Common examples of food related excototoxins are some preservatives, flavor enhancers and artificial sweeteners that overstimulate the glutamate receptors. It's a primary pathway by which that happens. These also stimulates genes to express inflammatory immune and cytokine responses. Once again adding for that inflammation effect we talked about. However there are different classes of nutrients, chemicals and hormones that can cross the blood brain barrier and serve important protective functions. For example higher levels of our own natural steroid hormones and various androgens appear to be associated with better cognitive and memory function and better mood than low levels in older people. We'll talk about that a bit more. It's part of the reason that cognitive function declines with age. It's the lowering of our natural steroid hormones. Bio identical hormone replacement's been found to improve cognitive function, memory and mental health in older adults. So anabolic hormones that are involved in the stimulation of brain growth factors. This may well be another reason why exercise is so important as it may also stimulate these classes of hormones in addition to the neurotrophic growth factors. Foundation Two is nutrition. Certain antioxidant nutrients that cross the blood brain barrier appear very neuroprotective and they reduce damage created by metabolism, waste products, excitotoxic reactions and they modify inflammatory reactions. The good news is we can do a lot with our diet and nutrition to support our brains to cope with the stresses of metabolism and protect our precious neurons. So what we can do to keep our brains healthy? Well, the first thing is watch the sugar in the diet. Our brains need carbohydrate to run efficiently. In fact that's the brains preferred fuel. While we need adequate glucose for our brains to function well, more is not better. We simply need enough. Our brains are very sensitive to blood glucose levels. Low blood sugar, hypoglycemia, almost immediately affects our brain resulting in drowsiness, slurring of speech, trouble concentrating. And the worst case scenario is unconsciousness and even death. Elevate blood sugar, hyperglycemia, is also a problem that can indicate reduced insulin sensitivity or diabetes. This means that our precious neurons and other cells might not be getting enough adequate glucose uptake. What happens to the elevated blood glucose as it washes past every cell in our body? Well there's two things. First it creates higher levels of glycation than normal, where glucose fuses with proteins themselves as we discussed before. Secondly, elevated glucose that is not burned up by cells is converted into triglycerides, a form of blood fat, leading to elevated blood levels of this lipid and weight gain. So does all this mean that skipping meals and snacking on sweets all day is problem and can potentially elevate blood glucose levels and create health problems in the long term? You bet it does. It's also a risk factor for diabetes. Our brains also need a constant supply of amino acids as these are used to make neurotransmitters. A couple of amino acids actually work as neurotransmitters. So and poor or overly processed diets often lack the essential nutrients to protect and create optimal brain functioning. So ensure enough protein in the diet, from plant and nuts, animal or dairy sources. This will supply amino acids. Get enough nutrition. When our cells burn glucose it requires oxygen which generates free radicals, as we've discussed before, which is part of the process of damaging the delicate membranes and micromachinery of our cells to the mechanism of new formation. Our bodies make antioxidants and anti-glycation chemicals. And these are abundant in youth, but decline rapidly as one gets older. And certainly poor health behaviors can overwhelm the body's natural protective systems. And these natural systems have their limits, particularly in the brain. And as we said poor diet can overwhelm them. Stress can overwhelm them. Lack of exercise can overwhelm them. It doesn't take a lot. So as our endogenous systems decline with age the role of nutrition becomes even more important to get these protective chemicals and provide optimal protection for our nervous system. So important principle is not to overeat. Huge meals cause rapid increases in blood fats and blood sugar and can be a part of postprandial lipidemia, and that's an excessive rise in triglyceride rich lipoproteins after eating). And this is a serious risk factor for cardiovascular disease and has been suggested by certain experts also for Type 2 diabetes. The same can happen for post meal glucose as well. When you get a surge of glucose after a meal that's uncontrolled our body can't cope with it. And as our arteries narrow, the bad news is less blood for our brains as well is often the case. Foundation 3: Dietary and supplement for neuroprotection. Some super foods are full of potent antioxidants that will protect our brains such as blueberries, and most other berries for that matter, all have compounds called polyphenolics. They're able to get through the blood brain barrier. And they're also potent gene modulators as well, this class of phytochemicals. They're found in smaller amounts in fruits and vegetables and nuts. They have an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect and inhibit proteins involved with signaling neuron death and upregulate neuron function and health. So some blueberries for example tend to stimulate brain derived neurotrophic factor. So they tend to help to keep the neurons alive and working well. And some studies have shown that in laboratory dishes when old neurons are exposed to blueberry extract their metabolism improves and they begin behaving like younger neurons again and start sprouting dendritic spines. So a useful thing to add to the diet. Grape seed extract is an antioxidant that improves blood vessel function and tone in the brain, as well as a neuroantioxidant. Brain levels, important with grape seed, it doesn't, levels don't peak very quickly. It takes a couple of weeks for the molecules to build up significant amounts in the brain. So you're getting the idea with some of these supplements or foods, we need to consume them regularly long term to get the benefits. Gingko biloba, an antioxidant that also supports healthy blood flow in the brain. And it's been used for thousands of years for exactly that purpose. And it's also thought to modulate the glutomate system and reduce-, protect the neurons against excitotoxicity and that reaction we talked about before where the neurons become overstimulated for various reasons. Curomin (found in tumeric). It's a potent antioxidant and has strong anti-glycation effects as well. And it's a powerful down regulator of genes involved with inflammation all throughout the body, including the brain. And it's thought to be chemo protective for that reason as well. So we mentioned before blueberries appear to improve neurogenesis, so blueberries are a stimulator of new brain cell development. So the neural progenitor cells, we tend to make them in varying amounts depending on our health and age and what not. Blueberries tend to upregulate the production of them, so if you want more brain cells eat lots of blueberries. As we said before they improve function in old malfunctioning cells. They improve neural connections with other neurons. And specific because they regulate genes involved with cell function and fluid balance. Uridine is an important phosphotide building block of RNA and DNA and it supports brain growth and is very important for neuroplasticity, which is our brain's capacity to change and develop as adults not just as children. If we want to maximize our learning Uridine's a good thing to get into the diet. Vincocentine, a herb which improves neural electrical conductivity in neurons and protects against excitotoxicity as well. And it's a remarkable herb that improves electrical communication between neurons. So dietary and supplement for neuroprotection. Ashwagandha, a plant that inhibits acetylcholine reuptake, and improves memory and concentration. Likewise some vitamins such as vitamin E, the B groups Choline. (It's acytelcholine precursor for memory) and phosphatidylserine, supports memory and neuroplasticity by supporting neuron function and structure. Alpha lipoic acid is an antioxidant and anti-glycation nutrient. It's very neuro protective, reduces inflammation and damage and stimulates neurotransmitters involved with learning, memory and mood. And lipoic acid is taken up by the brain very easily and it works in both the fat and water soluble domains. So it's kind of a universal protective nutrient. Omega 3 is typically sourced from fish oil, reduce inflammation processes in the brain and protects it from toxic reactions, supports mood and memory. In fact our neural tissues prefer omega 3 and preferentially take this up from the blood stream into cell membranes. Really important, omega 3's make the membranes very fluid and they let toxins be cycled out of cells and nutrients be cycled in. If we don't have omega 3's in the diet the membranes take up the more saturated or different types of fats and they don't work as well. Acetyl-L-carnitine arginate is an example of a supplement which has been shown to stimulate neural growth factor increasing the length and thickness of dendrites in the brain. So it actually increases the connectivity capacity of the brain, the strength of connections. CoQ10 and pyrroloquinoline quinone, that's a mouthful, supports energy metabolism and they're potent antioxidants. And PQQ may protect against neurological disorders and dementia and enhance memory via stimulating growth factors. Low levels of D3 is linked to cognitive decline and can predict Parkinson's disease. The vitamin D3 acts more like a hormone and it's shaping up as an essential supplement for health in all areas, neurological health as well as physical health. B6, B12 and folic acid slow brain atrophy in mildly cognitive impaired adults. And one of the mechanisms is via reducing homocysteine levels, which can selectively damage our arterial system as well as our neurological structures. Resveratrol's an excellent gene modulator for everything. That's another good one to get in the diet. Good news for the coffee drinkers, coffee evidence is shacking up to say coffee is very neuroprotective and may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. It reduces blood levels of albutim and in a dose dependent manner. And it also reduces the risk for Type 2 diabetes, better processing of blood sugar. And the caffeine and the other coffee components are important. When caffeine's given separately it doesn't have the same protective effect likewise decaffeinated coffee does not have the same protective effect either. So the combination of the full spectrum of nutrients in the coffee seems to be what's important. And the therapeutic effect seems best from about four cups a day. And the good news is it has to be proper coffee, not instant. So that's good news for coffee lovers. Tea's thought protective too and good for vascular health and neurological health. So that's better known perhaps, the protective effects of tea drinking. And that's good news for people who like to have tea and coffee. Long term antioxidant supplementation been shown to improve arterial health and insulin sensitivity. Once again if their cardiovascular system's in good shape our brain's likely to be in good shape. And if we have cardiovascular disease the chances are we've got terrible vascular disease as well. It's quite likely. There are many more brain friendly nutrients out there and it's well worth learning more about these and how to add them to our diet because it has an effect which can minimize our risk of developing neurological problems as we age. So Foundation 4. We'll look at depression and some big news for some people applying the principles we've already talked about will dramatically improve mood. Others may need more specialized intervention. It's important to realize that with people who struggle from depression that they're not doing the good nutritional foundations that's where we start. But if that's not sufficient or their diets are really quite good, consider the natural compound S. Anenosyl Methionine, which is, the trade name is SAM3. And it may be equally effective as prescribed medications for depression. And it's also a powerful brain antioxidant. It reduces inflammation as well. It's a methyliodide (ph). It's involved with the switching on of important genes in the brain, involved in the brain metabolism and neurotransmitter production through lots of pathways which are quite complex. It might be useful, so we can use it instead of an antidepressant medication and it works about as well for those people who have treatment resistant depression, which means that they don't get better no matter what we do. So they might be on antidepressants and are not improving. They might have had therapy and they haven't improved. If we add SAMe as an adjuvent, one American showed when taken in addition to antidepressants it doubled the remission rate compared to those on medication alone in a 6 week period. Quite impressive for people who don't get better anyway. A study I've done recently, we demonstrated that 800 mg a day of SAMe in addition to SSRIs more than doubled the remission rate in treatment resistant depression. So once again, a very similar finding. And we also show that there was a dramatic reduction in relapse as well. That of the effect of the SAMe as an adjuvent maintained improved symptom function across the sample. This is an important finding as we know that medications do not work on at least 30% of patients and have a mix of effectiveness for another 30%. So they're not the panacea on their own. So SAMe is made from natural amino acids and in fact our body makes it as well. It's an important compound in the body. And it supports monamine synthesis by affecting gene expression. We mentioned methylation which seems to regulate growth factors and neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine involved with mood. And so it's methylation versus phosphoration in DNA. And phosphoration is the other pathway in which we can modulate with nutrients for depression. Phosphoration through secondary mechanisms is about switching off genes which are unhelpful. And it's two interesting pathways, methylation and phosphoration, switching on and switching off bit of DNA in our genes. So endogenous levels of SAMe have been found to be lower in depressed people. And drugs, as we know, for example SSRIs work to reduce reuptake of serotonin whereas SAMe stimulates the production of serotonin. So getting the idea that SAMe is a more holistic way of approaching the problem. SAMe may stimulate and protect acytelcholine production which is involved with memory and concentration. And low levels have been implicated in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease as well. And SAMe supports our natural brain's antioxidant systems as well. It's best to take SAMe with B group vitamins as co-factors because SAMe is metabolized and broken down and we don't want it to metabolize into unhelpful things so taking the B groups, folic acid and B6 and B12 at least are sensible things to do with it to keep it working the right way. Saffron extract. Saffron's more than just a nice spicy thing we can put in food. It's got strong anti-depressant effects as well and it's on par with pharmaceutics. In fact studies have shown that saffron extract works about as well. Importantly when we use saffron extract in combination with anti-depressants it has an important function. A major reason why lot of people don't want to take anti-depressants is because of sexual dysfunction. If they're not depressed enough already, feeling bad enough the medication creates sexual dysfunction and they don't want to keep taking it because of that. A couple studies have shown that the saffron extract has reversed that effect. So it restores sexual function close to normal for people taking anti-depressants who suffer with the sympton. So it's an important thing to know about. Saffron extract modulates serogeneric receptors in the brain, supporting mood, increasing motivation and sense of positive mental energy. The other useful purpose of saffron has been it seems it selectivity influenced the desire for binge eating and modulates carb craving. And particularly binge eating where there's a strong emotional component, it seems to modulate that. A number of studies have shown that people with mood disorders, emotionally based binge eating, high carbohydrate content, saffron reduced that significantly in that population. L-tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin and melatonin. It may improve the quality of sleep as well as improve mood. In fact that's quite a reasonable thing to take as well. Uridine might be the next big thing in treating depression and a variety of mental health disorders-, the next big thing in treating depression and a variety of mental health disorder due to its favor of modulation of mitochondrial function and cell membrane signaling. Omega 3 supplements have been shown to be helpful for some people with depression, learning problems and hyperactivity. However results for individuals vary with Omega 3. They're certainly something worth adding as a first wave for anyone. St. Johns' Wort is a weak MAO inhibitor and weak reuptake inhibitor of serotonin. So it works a little bit like a couple of classes of anti-depressants. It also modulates the reuptake of dopamine and noradrenaline, and influences GABA and L-glutamate, and reduces the expression of interleukin-6. which is an inflammatory factor. So it has lots of useful functions And with this one, with St. Johns' Wort, because it works in some ways much like an couple of classes of anti-depressants, we'd never adjuvant (ph) that with an anti-depressant. So you'd never take them together. So with SAMe, L-tryptophan, fish oil, you certainly can take them together with anti-depressants and I will suggest of course under a physician's supervision and guidance because if we potentiate the treatment response they could well become overdosed on taking more than necessary of the anti-depressant. So it's important to make sure our clients are doing that in conjunction with their treating physician. Anxiety is another common problem that often parallels depression and certainly competes with it in terms of prevalence. And it can be a disorder in its own right, if not comorbid with depression. And anxiety disorders have nearly three times the prevalence of depression in the western world. Medications are a temporary fix. Problems of medication is tolerance and side effects. SSRIs have gained some popularity as a front line anti-anxiety medication and increases serotonin in the synapses and seems to modulate sympathetic, parasympathetic nerve system function and probably is preferable to benzos because it doesn't tend to be addictive and there doesn't tend to be as much of a tolerance effect. And we know that benzos stimulate GABA receptors and are calming or slow the metabolism in the brain. And the know the problems that go along with that with dependence and tolerance. So for generalized anxiety remember the Glutamate is the accelerator and GABA inhibits, if you like. It's the break for the brain. And those two neurotransmitter systems account for about, over 80% of brain activity. And of course it's oversimplified. But they're very, very important systems. They'll work in harmony to keep brain activity optimal. And anxiety problems suggest an imbalance, too much Glutamate or too little GABA. So too much Glutamate can cause excitotoxic reactions as we mentioned before and might be linked to the development of neurodegenerative disorders. And it makes sense. If our neurons are being hurt and inflamed and dying and what not that it's a recipe for cognitive decline and neurological disorders. Norepinephrine & dopamine. Norepinephrine increases alertness and arousal. And that's what we want for playing sports, but we don't want it all the time. So in social function and it's certainly involved with panic attacks as well. Dopamine's more complex. It can increase anxiety when levels are too high but is also anxiety protective in the right amounts. Dopamine improves motivation and improves the experience of pleasure. So physical pleasure, mental pleasure as well. And we're getting the idea you can start seeing the symptoms where deficiencies maybe of people finding they haven't got any pleasure in life. It's a possibility if they've lost physical pleasure, there's a loss of sensation of pleasurable activities, for example sex, it could be once again a dopamine problem. Serotonin's another possibility as well. So it often needs boosting, especially if anxiety symptoms are accompanied by negativity, apathy, fatigue, if they can't lose weight, no pleasure, poor sex drive as we mentioned before. All these things can indicate that. Serotonin. There's a wide range of functions from sleep, appetite, to impulse control and sexual desire. It can be calming and protects against cortisol, which is a stress hormone. Not everyone will feel good when they have high levels of serotonin. It may be low if anxiety is accompanied by low mood, insomnia, carb cravings always is an interesting sign, muscle aches and pains, impulsivity, insecurity and poor stress tolerance. Cortisol as we mentioned before. It's an important part of our stress response. In fact without it our physiology would not continue to work. But chronically elevated cortisol creates a host of health problems and neurological problems. And in fact it can begin to damage different brain structures if it's elevated for too long and damage our insulin response as well. So we can see in the little summary tables, and we'll look at some potential supplements that we can treat anxiety with. Thinking about the brain chemical glutamate, increases brain activity. Some supplements may be taurine, anacetyl (ph) choline, N-acetyle cystein, green tea, vitamin D3, magnesium, omega 3s. GABA, if we want to modulate that and slow brain activity. We want to calm people down if they're anxious. GABA, you can take as a supplement. It's an interesting one. It's a little bit-, can be absorbed through the gap and get into the brain. The little gap breaks down a lot of it. L-theanine is an important amino acid. Taurine, vitamin B6, zinc, insitol and some herbals. Norepinephrine increases alertness and to modulate that we can use L-theanine, N-acetyle cystein, omega 3s and inositol. Dopamine can focus attention, reward pleasure, these types of things. Once again L-theanine, B group vitamins, omega 3 and St. John's wort and gingko. If we want to modulate serotonin. It calms people, improves sleep, normalizes appetite and stress protective. Tryptophan, 5-HTP which is a precursor for serotonin. I'd probably suggest you use tryptophan. It's easier to buy and it's cheaper and works just about as well. DHEA, which is a hormone, folic acid is thought of as a B group, B6, B12, vitamin D3. Omega 3s and St. John's wort are good for that as well. So excessive cortisol, it's chronically elevated. We want to reduce that. DHEA, once again it's available on script. You can't buy it over the counter. B group vitamins, antioxidants and herbals all excellent for doing that. So my pick for anxiety and sleep? I really recommend L-Theanine which is a natural amino acid and it's found in high concentrations in green tea. It's effective as medication for treating anxiety in doses above 200 mg a day and has none of the side effects of tranquilizers. It even enhances concentration and memory. So people are likely to feel more alert and focused after using it rather than sedated as they might feel with the benzos. Increases serotonin and dopamine levels, and blocks the binding of L-glutamic acid to glutamate receptors. Once again stopping the overstimulation of the glutamate system. It promotes alpha brain waves, and that's a relaxed brain state. The herb Lemon Balm, it's a European herb that has been found to improve the quality of sleep for most people by about 20-40 percent with no sedative effects the next day. It may also improve concentration by modulating nicotinic and muscaninic receptors in the cortex. And therefore as you probably recognize those names, you can also use it to assist smokers to quit smoking. It's useful for dealing with cravings as well for nicotine. So something new for OCD and panic disorders, so obsessive compulsive disorders and panic disorders. N-acetyle cystein has been used as a treatment to prevent liver damage in acetaminophen or panadol and other substance overdose. And that's a-, panadol overdoses is one of the most common forms of liver failure actually. It's very, very liver toxic. That's why there are labels that say, are insistent about not taking more than the prescribed amount over a 24 hour period. However it also modulates the glutamate/GABA balance in the brain and is found useful in the full spectrum of obsessive compulsive disorders, gambling, trichotillomania, which is a compulsive hair pulling, and it's quite effective. Inositol reduces generalized anxiety, panic and OCD like symptoms as well. And it's been-, inositol's been found to be equally as effective as SSRIs for panic attacks without significant side effects. Some concerns over the use with bipolar people due to one report of worsening manic symptoms. But there hasn't been any systematic research into that. Taurine is a really important amino acid and more research is going on around it. And it's thought to be important for everything. But one neurological effect of Taurine is it calms the brain via the Glycine/GABA system. So it's Glutamate protective. It can possibly cause a little bit of drowsiness and mildly lower blood pressure, so it's a good one to take at bedtime. Taurine is involved with numerous physiological processes. And once again is one we need to key an eye on because it's going to tend to be big news in health over the years to come as its researched more. DHEA is one of the core hormones as the body makes the male sex hormones and female sex hormones from it. Unfortunately in Australia you can't buy it off script as you can in other countries for its regarded as a supplement. It is available on prescription from a medical doctor. It's been shown to reduce anxiety and improve mood and is very cortisol protective. In fact some research suggests there's a high-, in professions where there's a great deal of high risk of trauma such as the military, giving DHEA prophylactically reduces the right of post traumatic stress disorder after exposure to traumatic events. Pregnenolone is the mother hormone. DHEA is synthesized for the body from prenenolone. It is available as a supplement off script in Australia, but important when taking these sorts of things have blood levels checked. We just want physiologically appropriate amounts of these. We don't want super physiological amounts because it's not natural for the body to have huge amounts of these things in the body. Pregnenolone is also cortisol protective as well so people who have some of the ill health effects of cortisol, pregnenolone can reduce cortisol and also protect body tissues and neurological structures from the effects of cortisol. So once again looking at this further, supplement L-theanine, if we're going to use that I suggest divided doses of 200 to 800 milligrams a day. Or you can drink lots of green tea. You probably get 200 milligrams. You're going to be wanting to drink around six to ten cups, depending on how strong you like it. That's a lot. But it is a viable supplement form for those who wish to do that. And remembering that it's calming and improves concentration. 5-HTP or tryptophan in respectively in 50 to 100 milligrams twice daily. Tryptophan 1000 milligrams once before bed. Increases serotonin, reduces anxiety and improves depression. And I'd probably suggest try L-tryptophan first before moving to 5-HTP. N-acetyle cystein, 600 milligrams a day, three times daily for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder, the spectrum. Taurine, 500 milligrams once a day. Improves glutamate/GABA system. Insitol, 1000 milligrams up to three times a day for panic or obsessive compulsive disorder, phobias. GABA, 750 milligrams a day three times daily for the same purpose of course but remembering that it's less well absorbed. DHEA ten milligrams a day onwards. Once again that would depend on blood work, what the person's endogenous hormone levels are like. Typically people much over their mid-thirties, they're getting low. So it'll often be more than for men. Women may find themselves around that amount. Pregnonolone, starting dose is probably about 50 milligrams a day for that. Once again it helps modulate the stress response. Psychosis is a more serious mental health problem from the point of view of ultimate debilitation of people with symptoms. And really markedly little is know about it even with all the years of research that's gone into understanding the genetics of it. There are some theories with relevance to nutrition that may be useful. One theory which has some scientific credibility is defective genes result in oxidized adrenaline hormone, creating adrenochrome. And some research has shown that high dose niacin and vitamin C reduce adrenaline production and oxidization with good results in symptoms for some people. Once again it's not a panacea, but for some people it does seem to work well. If we're going to use this approach they need regular liver function tests because of the high dose niacin. Fish oil, this is something which is more across the board and less specialized, could help the development of schizophrenia in teenagers and young adults. And so it's an important thing to reduce the risk in people we think might be at risk. And that's due to one Australian study. Adding fish oil to standard antipsychotic drug therapy may accelerate treatment response and improve the tolerability of antipsychotic medications in people with schizophrenia. That's an important finding. The symptom response might be more rapid to medication and side effects may be more tolerable with the addition of fish oil. Once again, we're not talking one little capsule a day. Usually the doses need to be fairly significant. That's usually several grams a day of fish oil we're talking to do that. And a simple way is to increase the doses until somebody finds they get the optimal response to that. Unlikely to cause any health complications, fish oil, some people find that they don't tolerate it well. It can upset their stomach. There are forms that might upset stomach. People who take anti coagulant medications or warfarin, once again, fish oil's something that should be considered only in conjunction with consultation with their doctor because fish oil has a mildly coagulant effect as well. So we don't want to increase the potency of the pallet reducing effect in the body. We don't want them to bleed out. Learning and memory, to improve that. L-theanine and lemon balm, Ginkgo, vinpocetine helps modulate neurotransmitters involved with attention and memory, phosphatidylserine supports neuroplasticity. Great ones to enhance our memory and learning. Acetyl-L-Carnitine Arginate, Ashwanganda, Choline, blueberry are all neurochemical and neuron modulators. So they are the good things we can do. Pregnenolone has an independent effect on memory and neurological function as well as other useful effects. Rhodiola supports energy production in neurons and it's particularly good for older people. Omega 3 is just good for everything when it comes to the brain. So behaviour problems and addictions. So we're working with people with these sorts of issues. Omega 3's have been found to be useful in this area. Once again, most people are not going to get better on omega 3s but it's a useful thing that will give some degree of improvement for a lot of people. But we hope to see more significant responses on things like L-theanine, lemon balm, Ginkgo, vinpocetine, because that will modulate the neurotransmitters involved with attention and memory. And phosphatidylserine, B group vitamins, folic acid, St. John's Wort. You can see it's a nice combination effect as we can use with people's behavior problems and addictions. With children I can try all that. I probably wouldn't add the St. John's wort as a first cab off the rink. But try those other nutritional approaches first. Failing that, St. John's wort in conjunction with a physician. Adults, once again making sure they're not already taking anti-depressants before the addition of St. John's wort. Weight loss. It's another common problem people present for assistance with. Saffron extract is particularly good for dealing with cravings and the emotional component of eating. And it's shown to reduce desire to snack by around 50 percent. And also a 50 percent reduction in snacking behaviors between meals, as well as better mood. Pinolenic acid, that's an extract of pine nut. It increases hunger suppressing hormones, CCK and glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1). And reduces desire to eat by about 36 percent in studies. That's an average, so everyone would be a little different with how they experienced that. CLA conjulated linoleic acid, increases fatty acid oxidization in the liver so it's harder to gain weight when we take it. And there's more weight loss when used in an exercise program. And it preferentially preserves lean muscle mass during and encourages the burning of fat during weight loss. And as people may be aware, when we diet we tend to burn up muscle and the body wants to hang on to the fat because it thinks it's going to starvation mode. And these sort of CLAs a great supplement because it preserves lean muscle mass and encourages the body to burn up the fat during dieting and exercise. A variety of fibers, you've probably heard about different fibers. They're carbs and fat blockers and they can help with weight reduction as well. You take them before a meal to reduce the absorption of carbohydrate and what not. Being careful, those they certainly have a purpose that they can reduce nutrient absorption as well. If they're a fat blocker, some nutrients are fat soluble so you can see the connection there. Thermogenics, they're hurdles or combinations of things which are designed to increase our metabolism. Some people find them useful. But they probably have a mild benefit, certainly not something you'd be starting with. The best thermogenic is exercise. We want to increase our metabolism and metabolism stays raised for nearly two days after we have an exercise session. So is we kind of exercise every second day or five days a week we are able to maintain a elevated rate of metabolism continuously. Foundation 5, the one stop shop for mental health: exercise. Our brains like it when we do physical activity. The old saying is a healthy body means a healthy mind is true. Sitting in front of a TV all day is not going to cut it for our brains. We need to get moving. Exercise has been shown to help symptoms of all types of mental health problems. It independently improves severity of depression, anxiety, schizophrenia. It assists with managing addictions and the list is endless. Exercise stimulates neural growth factors in the formation of new neurons and stimulates dendritic connections to grow between neurons and enhance neurotransmitter levels. It does this in areas of the brain involved in memory and learning and mood. All forms of exercise are beneficial. However most of the research is focused on aerobic exercise where the heart rate is raised, and not is much is known about other forms of exercise such as weight training. While there's no conclusive proof in humans, high intensity exercise may be best when we are younger and moderate intensity exercise such as aerobic exercise and strength training tied from middle age onwards. And that's based largely on animal models. Regular exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in old age so it might help to protect against Alzheimer's disease, depression, anxiety disorders and improve recovery from addictions. Exercise certainly modifies risk factors for most health problems such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, sarcopinia, which is the age related loss of muscle mass, osteoarthritis, and stress which are all factors that in the long term might be involved with cognitive decline. So some risks. Nutritional supplementation approaches have minimal side effects and are remarkably safe compared to prescription medications. But they are biologically active compounds so we need to treat them with respect. And one of the big risks is that people often go it alone and they try to work it out for themselves and often take the wrong supplements. Or they stop existing treatments that are prescribed, or they combine natural approaches with medications without seeking advice. And some mood regulating nutrients may interact with anti-depressants. And beneficial as we discussed in non-beneficial ways, which we've also discussed. So if we have clients or patients who are wanting to do this, careful evaluation and monitoring is needed if treating mental health problems naturally. And of course we'd always recommend the client or patient to be discussing these approaches with their treating physician. Some forgotten culprits in mental health. And this are things such as health problems such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, heart disease, and hormone levels. Really important if we're physically unwell we're not likely to have good mental health. If you've got cardiovascular problems, maybe you've got blood problems in the brain too with cerebral blood flow. Hormone levels are out of balance so it affects our neurological health as well. If we're overweight, high blood sugar, all these things will affect mood, through all these pathways we've discussed so far. One of the most over looked I think is sleep disorders, obstructive or central sleep apnea is underdiagnosed as a rule. In fact a lot of people don't know that they have it. There's a strong association with depression. In over anxiety, people have obstructive sleep apnea. Most often people are assessed and they come away with a diagnosis of mild sleep apnea with an advice of no treatment or dental devices which hold the throat open. And probably that's under treatment. And I'm of the view it should be more vigorously treated, mild sleep apnea. And because people often have a marked improvement of mood and anxiety with treatment. Sleep apneas even in the mild form have a strong association with cerebral vascular disease and risk of stroke. And if we think most people have this for a long time untreated, slowly damage builds up in the blood vessels of the brain. Blood pressure goes up and it can cause hyper tension as well. Often that improves with treatment. So it's a risk factor for cognitive degeneration, and demyelination diseases, which are a whole host of neurological diseases. This is new research. It's also a bit of opinion. It likely has links with flair hyper intensities. They picked up an MRI that's marked small changes to cerebral blood vessels, probably would have been checked out for sleep apnea if it comes up on the MRI. You're often told they're normal, not to worry. They're not normal. They're the beginning of cerebral vascular disease. So a recent study also shows that the brain changes that occur with apnea and there's changes to the memory center of the brain begins to atrophy, the hippocampus begins to atrophy. People have cognitive and memory symptoms. Good news is that with treatment with a CPAP machine within a number of months people have nearly made a full recovery. So the areas of the brain tend to recover. Very long term untreated sleep apnea, it's not a 100 percent recovery but it's a significant improvement. So well worth checking out on your clients and patients when we're thinking about the range of health problems. So to conclude, adopting a brain healthy lifestyle will have significant benefits for overall health and maintaining our healthy brains into old age. So we should consider adding specific dietary nutrients or supplements to upregulate genes involved with neurotransmitters and brain health and minimize the risk of cognitive decline or dementia. We should consider specific supplements or compounds to assist with the treatment of mental health or behavioral problems. We shouldn't forget exercise. And we should do this under the guidance and supervision of an appropriately trained health practitioner. And we should not encourage a go it alone approach. And encourage good quality sleep and make sure we have a good night's rest. Okay, well I'd like to thank you for listening to this presentation and I wish you well with the application of these idea. Good bye.
