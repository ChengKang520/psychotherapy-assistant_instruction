DR. PAT LOVE Welcome. I am Dr. Pat Love of Pat Love and Associates, a licensed marriage and family therapist and 25 year clinical member approved supervisor in AMFT and a relationship consultant. And we're talking about this question, can sex go out of bounds? I want you to think about that. If sex sort of crosses the line or goes out of bounds, what would that mean for you? And truthfully, can it actually go out of bounds at all? Because in the… in many ways in the field we have a… a continuum between those who think, listen, sex is natural, it's orderly, it's healthy, we're born sexual creatures, and expressions will vary and we need to embrace that variation. And then there are others that say, you can't cross the line, it can become you know, abusive, there can be victims, there can be… it can be compulsive, it can even be an addiction. And so you know that there are… there are people all along this continuum. And I want to look at that and to say, if it can go out of bounds where is the line? And I think as clinicians and helpers we really need to know not only that, yes, relationships vary, yes, sexual behavior varies, but there are winds for each client and legal lines that can be crossed. And we want to look at what questions to ask. We know that we are sexual beings. You know, now once we started printing out pictures of babies in uterus, you know, with the sonogram, we found that there were babies masturbating. You say, well, why would they do that? It feels good, it's a natural drive to stimulate ourselves and to enjoy that stimulation. Sex is also a motivational drive when it comes to moving toward another person. It's an instinct, we're born with it. You know we're born sexual creatures for the most part. It's recognized by the brain, sexual stimulation, 20% faster than any other stimulation. Recently, I just completed a book with my daughter and a co-author, Swedish co-author and they sent us the cover. And they were saying, here… here different… they're like ten different examples of possible covers. And actually the one I like the bet… best to me looked like a woman's butt. And I wrote back to the editor and I said, I may just have a dirty mind, but to me, I like it, but it looks like a woman's but. And she said, that is hilarious. She said, because I said the very same thing and my colleague said, I just had a dirty mind. But the truth of it is, it's natural to see sexual stimulation where whether it's intended or unintended. Well, why is that? Because it's how we procreate, propagate, survive… survive as a species. So, we know it's a motivational drive, we know it's really natural and so we don't condemn it in others. Except, is there a line, do we have a boundary that we can cross? We are hardwired for sex, we know that. It's activated by the senses. You might remember a sexual experience or a partner that you had or maybe an aftershave or cologne or a perfume or a soap or a shampoo that when you smell it or you use it, it reminds you of where you were with that partner or that partner. I had a client one time that was grieving and he had been grieving for three years. And the last piece of the grief was he could not let go of the smell of his partner's hair. He just, he longed for it. And why is that? Because sexuality is activated by our senses. That's why touching is so important. One of the homework assignments I give so many couples has to do with touching. While a good meal will raise your dopamine level 50%, sex will raise it a 100%. We are so motivated by sex and there's a big, big payoff, isn't it? I want… it should go without saying, but I want a slide to say this, of course not all sexual acts, fetishes, pornography are out of bounds. So, when we talk about, can sex go out of bounds? There is so much sexual activity that's well within bounds that may not me, but might not be my preference, might not be your preference, but it's certainly in bounds. And we want to allow for that variety. Sexual boundaries are also cultural, aren't they? You know, what's perfectly acceptable in one culture can actually get you killed in another culture. But what explains this, a woman isolating herself from friends and fa… friends and family while seeking virtual sexual stimulation. Is that a boundary? So isolation, is that a boundary? Having unprotected sex with a… with a multitude of partners, safety, is that a boundary? A wife having multiple affairs despite pleas of a loving loyal spouse, is commitment a boundary? Husband paying for prostitutes despite a robust relationship with his wife, is that a boundary? Are there legal boundaries? So we begin to look at these boundaries. Why would a man climb a tree to watch a woman undress when he can do it safely and legally in another settings. You know, again, a legal privacy boundary. Why an intelligent person would have sex with an under-aged partner? Again, a legal and a very, very private, personal boundary. Why knowledge of potential ruin does not deter an employee from downloading pornography on the company computer? Fifteen percent of Fortune 500 companies have fired someone for using pornography on the job. What kind of motivation leads to autoerotic asphyxiation? Just for a sexual high, people have died, strangling themselves to the point of oxygen deprivation just to get that high. What would lead a person to do this? These are clients that can show up in your office. How you experience sexual desires? What frightens or disgusts you, reminds you that it will prove an adequate understanding the sexual practices of others? So, that's what we're going to look at in this section. Here's a hint, fear enhances sex by releasing hormones which further enhance the reward centers. Fear exacerbates, exaggerates every emotion. So, if you get stimulation or titillation or thrill from looking at your neighbor through the window, just think the fear in the risk makes it even better and stronger and more of a thrill. Fear accelerated the reward. And I think that's a key, that's really a key when you start working with clients and you're looking at patterns. Who's prone to go out of bounds? We know there's a certain ba… brain chemistry. You know right now it looks like it's dope… it's a dopaminergic issue that if you have a (inaudible ), you know, if you are D2 receptors and you don't get pleasure from the normal everyday activities then you may be more susceptible. We know trauma. You know, the inability to regulate your emotions, and trauma often translates into impulsivity. You don't think about it, you just do it because it feels good. So, if you grew up with trauma that could be a predictor. How you cope with stress? You're going to see a lot of people use sex because it feels so good and it gives you a high, as a stress management technique. And so if you know why they're doing it, that starts to point the way toward intervention. Family history of addiction. Sometimes we see it modeled, sometimes we get a genetic predisposition. So, where do we draw the line? You know we're talking about healthy sex consenting adults, mutual respect, non-coercive, responsible. You know that's what we're talking about, those are healthy boundaries. So, where do you go out of bounds? And here's a set of questions and you don't have to use them all. But this is an important set of questions because when you're working with clients, it's not just my opinion, it's not just what would be out of bounds for me or for you, it's okay, where does the society, our culture, our mental health say the lines are drawn and where… but what's even more important, where do people who say sex is a problem for me, who self-identify as a sex addict or a compulsive or a person who has problem with misusing sex, where do they say the line got crossed for them? So, here's the set of questions. Number one, and you're looking for yes or no. Do you experience an irresistible urge to do this behavior against your conscious wishes? People will tell you, I don't want to do it, I hate it that I do it and I do it. So, it's almost like it's out of your… it feels like it's not conscious, but I do it, I go into a state and I just do it. Have you promised or tried to cut back or to eliminate this activity without success? See, you're starting to… See where you… you have a boundary, but you've crossed your own boundary. Do you use this activity to manage stress or unhappiness? So when I'm… you know. And I want you to think for a moment. Does everyone of us probably has an activity that we overdo it, you know. So, you start to think of when do you overdo it. When you get stressed, do you think, I'm eating that ice cream tonight, I don't care what, you know. Or I'm going to happy hour, I don't care if it's Monday, you know, whatever. So you begin to see if you use this activity to manage stress or unhappiness. Have you lied to yourself or others about the seriousness of this activity? That's a big one, because you remember, your core values are your guiding, it's the North Star around your behavior. Are you lying, are you denying, are you justifying? That's what you find yourself doing. Have you lied to yourself or other people about the seriousness? Would you be embarrassed if they knew the truth? Do you spend far more time and energy in this activity than you planned? You know, you're texting, you're online, you're viewing pornography, you're looking for that perfect drive-by or you're seeing, you know, if I could follow this guy or if I could fondle this woman on the train. I mean, are that you spend a lot of time and energy, it's call grooming, grooming for the next event. Are there times when this activity becomes the central focus of your life? You can't wait to get home to do it, you can't wait to have an opportunity to do it. And so your day is sort of focused around this activity. Do you feel guilt, shame or embarrassment about this activity? Would you be embarrassed if other people knew the extent to which you're doing this? Because the guilt is corrective, it feels yucky, and it's designed to get us to move back to our core values, back to our finer character. And so, if you're feeling guilt and shame… and by the way, this isn't me saying you have a problem, that's you answering these questions. That's what I love about this. It's a self-assessment, it's not me a being the police, you know. It's not me, it's you, putting yourself in this category. Does curtailing this activity make you crave it more? Do you become obsessed with it? Have you experienced serious consequences in your work or personal life because of this activity? I mean that's a set of questions that I think every practitioner should have, a set of questions about that. Because if you're answering yes to three or more of these, or even one is worth discussion, isn't it? But three or more, you're fitting… what you're saying is, I now have placed myself in amongst a group of people who seek help for this who are saying, I have a problem. Where they use the word sex-addict, where the use sexually compulsive, acting out behavior, whatever word you want to use. But what you're saying when you answer these questions, you know. And it may… it maybe the… the client will… will lying in the home and think about it, you know because it's embarrassing, isn't it, to be able to answer it. And you… And you… it doesn't… you know, you may or may not want your client answering out loud at this point because we… depending upon where they are in the change process. And I'm going to mention that in a moment. But the point is, these are really good questions to start, to draw a line. Sex can become a compulsive, compulsion as well as obsession and these are people… what are we talking about? Inordinate amount of time spent thinking, fantasizing, preparing for being sexual, recovering from being sexual, controlling damage from time and resources spent. Damage control is a big one. And a need to increase the intensity, frequency, and risk to get the same benefits. Nobody starts out looking at mutilated bodies having sex, pardon my example. No one starts out there. It's just that, remember, novelty is what's novel today, is familiar tomorrow. So nobody starts out looking at that pictures that might even disgust them in the beginning or starts out grooming you know, a co-worker or a neighbor for a relationship. Nobody starts out consciously thinking, I'm going to have sex despite my commitment to myself and my family. Nobody starts out that way, because the… but this is what happens, you build up a tolerance to it. And you need to increase the intensity, frequency, risk to get the same benefits. So, and… and just… just so will be credible here. There are many, many levels of sexual compulsion. Right now we're just talking about level one, we're not talking, you know about exhibitionism. Basically we're talking about what level one where… are often called victimless crimes even though you could argue that prostitution does have a victim. You could also talk… argue that pornography might have a victim. You know, umm… the relation… compulsive relationship, you could argue that. But basically, we're talking about level one, we're not talking about level two and level three. But I do want to say this, working in this area requires a special training. It's very rewarding training and by the way, it's a growing area of need. So, if this appeals to you, you can really help a lot of people. In a relationship, sexual… sexual compulsion is an intrapersonal issue with interpersonal consequences. It's my choice, I don't make you drink, I don't make you shop too much, that's a choice you make. But those choices affect me, you know. And there are people who would argue, well, it always takes two. It's a personal choice, responsibility stops with the person who is acting out. If your partner is otherwise preoccupied by the way, you are loving into a void. Because the compulsion, the addiction, the focus is on the grooming and getting and recovering from the sexual activity. The commodity of relationships are interest in energy. I have to… I have to be here, don't I? I have to show up. And not only just have my body here, I have to be tuned in. And so if I'm always thinking about my next sexual act, I'm here, but I'm not here. And my partner then is loving into a void. In facts some signs that you're loving into avoid: blocks of private time. If you're in a relationship and your partner just has blocks of unexplained time. There but not there. Loss of interest in intimacy activities. You know sometimes sex still goes on, but what… what I've had partner say to me is, it changed, he changed, she changed. Or could be he or she lost interest altogether. But it could be, yes, we're having sex, we're being intimate, but something is different. Loss of interest in couple and family social activities. One it takes time. It takes time away from you. And also we don't like people who remind us of our bad behavior. We resent people who remind us of our bad behavior. So, you can see where that gets sticky. Anger, defensiveness, denial upon complaint, irritability, anxiety. "Gaslighting" is comes from an old movie where a husband try to make his wife think she was crazy by turning the gas down to making the lights go dim. It's an interesting old, old movie. The "Gaslighting," because the… when a partner complaints, complaints, it's usually met with anger and, you're crazy. So, usually if you've got a crazy partner the other ones often lying. So, why is this compulsive behavior threatening to the relationships? It's a fuel leak. As I mentioned, you know, if you're going to be in a relationship, you've got to… we know that we're hardwired for connection. You know you have to have someone for… you know, we're hardwired for connection as well as for sex. And there's a wide range of healthy sexual behavior. But, most relationships want three things, they want chemistry, they want compatibility and they want commitment. Oh, what is commitment? It's a commitment to show up, to sort of tune in and tune in to… to you long enough to understand you. And then once I understand you, my behavior should be congruent with my understanding. And so of you've asked me to be more attentive, to remember, to participate, to be more forthcoming, to initiate sex, to initiate contact. And you've said it time and time again I might hear it. But if I'm not listening, my behavior won't be congruent with my understanding of you. So, you begin to see why it's a fuel leak. Healthy relational sex consists of consenting adults, mutual respect, responsibility. Individuals are more prone. Some individuals are more prone for going out of bound. You need to know that about yourself. You know, if you're an alcoholic, you probably shouldn't be hanging out in the bar. You should, you know, if you know that about yourself, you know, that's why we have open policies, maybe with our computer or our cell phone. If I know I have… I have misused pornography, if it… I have used it to the point that it's changed my arousal template, that which I find sexually, interesting and attract… attractive, you know, because literally you can distort what… what attracts you with pornography use for example. So, if I know that's a problem for me… now if I have a computer out where there's, you know, the open air, there should be an open air policy. Just like with children, there should be… you know, this is my phone, I bought it, I'm going to let you use it, but I get check it because it's my phone, you know, an open air policy. So, we know that if you're prone to going out of bounds then, okay, all of us have these have some weaknesses, right. And we… So you need to know that about yourself and then put a protective boundary around your relationship or your time or your work to make it safe for you, so that you can then be acting congruently within your own core va… core values. Okay. Going out of bounds is an intrapersonal choice with interpersonal consequences. Where this is really important is if you have a partner in your office or even a couple in your office, because… because it effects me and because I have such an investment in you being here and being attune to me there is the temptation for me to try to manage your behavior. That's why I've said it and wanted to have it in the slide more than once. It's an intrapersonal choice. So that for me to micromanage your behavior if I'm doing your work, why should you do your work? If I'm doing it for you, if I am monitoring you why should you monitor yourself? And then you're going to resent me and you're going to push back for me. So, I've said that more than once for a reason. Umm… There are establish guidelines for determining healthy boundaries. And core value living can keep you inbound. That's always the bottom line, is a core value living. Thank you, and I want to ask one last thing, are there any questions? 

00:23:00
UNKNOWN I have a question. 

00:23:05
PAT LOVE Okay. 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN So you talked a lot about when you have a couple and one is acting out sexually and how the other partner may want to micromanage that activity. So how is it that you can help that partner not micromanage the activity? 

00:23:20
PAT LOVE Oh, that's a good question. How can you help a partner not micromanage that activity? Because as… as I mentioned, yes, it's a personal issue but it's interpersonal in its effect because you're really being affected by that partner's behavior. I guess the short answer to working with these couples and let me sort of back off to give you a general answer and then to move in and give you a more specific answer. The general answer is this, don't try this alone as a therapist. If you have a couple and you know one is acting out in the sexually compulsive way or and has identified as a sex addict or etcetera, right then and there you want to gather support. Because here's what research says, research says the best model for working with these… with a couple like… like you know, that presents in this way is… is sort of known as the three legged stool. And that means it's a stool that has three legs. What are the three legs? Basically three therapists. And that means the partner has a therapist, the person who's identifying with the problem has a therapist. And then you have a couple's therapist. Especially if this is a couple who wants to stay together, okay. So, because you can imagine it comes in a lot of different forms. Because… Because sex is a part of a committed love relationship for most couples. This "compulsive act", this behavior feels far more personal than ever… even… even like gambling or overspending or drinking, you know. Yes, those are problems, but this feels like you gave away something that belongs to me. So a part of the agenda for the partner is to manage, how do you manage the impulse to over function, and to be checking, and to be monitoring, and how do you, you know, how do you keep… how do you learn emotional regulation. And that is, you have to come up with a safety, a way to establish safety in the relationship, safety for personal safety for yourself. That's part of feel the feeling, but do the right thing. You've got to channel that impulse into saying, what would a loving partner do? What would a smart partner do? What with a, you know a strong woman do in this place? What would, you know, what would I do knowing that if I do his or her work why should he do his or her work? So a big part of that is managing your own emotions. And that would be on the agenda of the partner while the person who's identified as the problem will go ahead and do the work, his or her work on the issue and then the couple, but in that couple there are two or three things that are very bottom-line that helps the partner. And one is, we have got to come up with a safety signal, we have got a way, have a way to have safe conversations or when I'm feeling anxious, I've got to have a way for you to give me reassurance that works for me, if you're working on the relationship. If you get a contract and this is a couple who says as I want to stay together, you've got to give them skills for creating safety, emotional regulation and how we can check in with one another so I will know you're doing your work. I think that's really important. I had a particular couple come to me and he actually was in therapy. And the therapy was working, but she wasn't included. So, she didn't know if she could even trust the therapy. Yes, it looked like he was getting better, but because she had no information. So, she didn't get any reassurance from him and every time she would ask him, he would get defensive and he would say, you're just trying to micromanage my… you're trying to organize my recovery, and this is my recovery and it's not you and… I mean, he would get angry with her which would make her feel even more frightened and even more left out. And they came so close to breaking up not because his recovery wasn't working, but because she was exclusive and there was no way to establish safety, there was no way to give reassurance, and there was no way to regulate the emotions in the relationship. And she didn't… she didn't… she had no ladder to climb up to say, okay, this is why I think you're getting better because you're doing step one, step two, step three, then I can start to trust this new behavior. Because what she said to me was, well, before, you know, you're lying to me before, why should I believe you now? And when she wasn't getting any information, there wasn't any safety between the two of them and there was no way to regulate those emotions, she wasn't getting coaching around the regulating her emotions. He was working a program, but she had no idea what that program was, so she didn't think she could trust the behavior. So I think part of it is you've got to have a way if you're working with these couples even, you know, to… to one, you got to manage the partner's fear usually and the person who's in the compulsive activity, their shame. Because… And by the way, let me just say one thing, shame is so strong and especially for men, it's not that women like it you know, but for men, it will make them stop and hide. And this is what was happening in this particular, this particular couple is that he felt so much shame, he couldn't even talk about it. And so that's where couples therapy, the third leg of the stool really helps calm everything and helps you have give reassurance, you know, because we all feel reassured in very different ways. So, I know that's a long answer, but it… it is a part of it, it… it is managing your own emotions, creating safety and getting reassurance and having someone guide you through that. One last quick question. Is there another question that you have? 

00:29:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. I had a question along the lines of… of shame as well. That if the other end of the spectrum there are some people who's have such a restrictive attitudes towards sexuality from their cultures that any sexual thoughts or actions are considered quite shameful or they feel they are out of control, I was hoping you might speak to that. 

00:30:10
PAT LOVE Yeah, yeah, because there are people who come in with religious beliefs or cultural beliefs and then they're having these natural impulses, and there… it's an internal conflict. So, let me give you a magic phrase, that I always start with, and I say to the client, I start every session the very same way, "How can I help?" What's one small thing you would like to do in relation to this issue that would be helpful, because I don't… I would want to just slow everything down and find out what's congruent for you. Guilt happens like this, when your behavior and your belief don't line up. So, if I believe I shouldn't feel this way and I feel this way, I feel guilty, you know. So, I either got to change my beliefs or change my behavior. So, that's… I would start there, "How can I help?" Do you want to change your belief, you want to change your behavior or you want to go on feeling guilty? And I would show them the cycle they are caught in because my hunch is that guilt gets translated into some behavior as a reward that creates that cycle. So, I would be following the client on that very, very important question. Thank you all, so much.
