Narrative Skills: Practice exercises for developing counselling skills Part two: Decision-making and Externalizing with Lorraine Hedtke Ph.D. and John Winslade Ph.D. 

00:00:00
A Decision-Making Coversation 

00:00:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Ok. So, uhm, Let's talk a little bit about how we make decisions using a, uhm, Narrative Counseling, uhm, techniques... 

00:00:45
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:00:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE ...and thinking and, and where I want to start trying is, is seeking that how is my earlier training that, Decisi-, Decision Making when I am working with a client that accounts and might be encouraged to do things like, uhm, explore the stories of conflict or may be encourage the clients to go home with homework and making them work pros and cons and, you know, kind of try weigh out those different things and, and seeking how Narrative approach is actually quite different in how you go about making, uh, uhm, important decisions... 

00:01:15
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:01:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE ... and, and so wanting to may be look at that, you know, is that your sense that Narrative approach is different and, uhm, first conversations. 

00:01:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. And the pros and cons, uhm, idea comes from that sort of analytical thinking problem solving logical tradition. 

00:01:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm. 

00:01:40
JOHN WINSLADE And, uhm, a Narrative perspective is more about how, uhm, I think people actually make decisions on the basis of stories. 

00:01:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:01:55
JOHN WINSLADE And when I say stories, I mean, the stories of what has happened in the past, the stories that they are projecting out into the future, the cultural background stories that are shaping them and that their own story is often stories that come from the world around us that shape what we do, and how we decide. 

00:02:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm. 

00:02:10
JOHN WINSLADE And so, I think it, a Decision-Making conversation which is kind of one aspect of, uhm, a counseling relationship perhaps might be, uhm, the conversation that, that actually sorts out and untangles some of those background stories and then... 

00:02:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm. 

00:02:30
JOHN WINSLADE ...helps to, uhm, explore their effects in the, uhm, in the ongoing process of, of reaching decisions. 

00:02:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Where do you think, uhm, other people play in that sort of, you have a, uh, a single client, uh, uhm, a, an indivdual saying with you, trying to make a decision. What's the importance of other people in that Decision-Making process you think? 

00:02:50
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, that's an interesting question because the, uhm, the dominant discourse in the counseling field has been to work with people I think to isolate them in their Decison-Making to make them, uhm, make decisions in, uhm, under the rubric of personal responsibility, if you like. 

00:03:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm. 

00:03:15
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, individual personal responsibility. 

00:03:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm. 

00:03:20
JOHN WINSLADE Rather than thinking in more relation terms. 

00:03:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:03:25
JOHN WINSLADE And if we think in more relation terms what we notice is that, uhm, people, I don't think seldom make decisions totally on their own, they make them in relation to the poles of their experience in relationship... 

00:03:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:03:45
JOHN WINSLADE ...the anticipated effects on other people as well as on themselves... 

00:03:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm. 

00:03:45
JOHN WINSLADE ...especially with people that care about their love... 

00:03:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm. 

00:03:50
JOHN WINSLADE ...uh, or admire... 

00:03:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:03:50
JOHN WINSLADE ...or look up to or drive from or inspired by. 

00:03:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. Right. 

00:03:55
JOHN WINSLADE So for me a, a relation making decision conversation is going to, uhm, and be that relates to the dimesnion. 

00:04:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm. Hmm. 

00:04:05
JOHN WINSLADE And explore not just the personal realm of responsibility but the, uhm, the, uhm, kind of relational exchange that goes on between an individual and then the anticipation of how others in the audience, of their interactions might actually, how they might respond? 

00:04:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm. 

00:04:30
JOHN WINSLADE So, I takes into account the audience, takes into account influences... 

00:04:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Sure. 

00:04:30
JOHN WINSLADE ...and takes into account cultural disclosures and how we relate to those, uhm, and takes into account background stories that are grown from to make up their own personal stories. 

00:04:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE So, as to, as you are trying to make sense of how to have this kind of conversation, as they listen to this portion of , uh, uh, that take today. What kinds of things do you want them to be listening for? 

00:05:05
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, well, one thing I want them to listen to is the position that I take up as a counselor, uhm, which is, uhm, that I am not their to argue for any one particular decision and there are something that's not a big issue, you know, like whether I choose to eat Broccoli for dinner or not. 

00:05:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:05:35
JOHN WINSLADE It's not going to be a huge matter for me to take up a position in relation to. But when the decision is something like, whether or not I am going to commit suicide that's an other matter. 

00:05:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm. 

00:05:45
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, and counselors often get easily drawn into arguing for or asking questions that shape the argument towards, uhm, uh, not commiting suicide rather than taking ones own life. 

00:06:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE It's, it's an important point for me... 

00:06:00
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:06:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE ...is why would I not want to do that as a counselor, I would have a strong, uhm, preference that my client not commit suicide. So, why would I... 

00:06:10
JOHN WINSLADE So do I. 

00:06:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE ...right, so why would I not argue that position? 

00:06:15
JOHN WINSLADE Because if I do argue strongly or hint strongly or, uhm, persuasively, uhm, present that one side of that argument. 

00:06:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm. 

00:06:25
JOHN WINSLADE Chances are a little, basically, in, in a way from the motivation of interviewing... 

00:06:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:06:30
JOHN WINSLADE ...people, uhm, the, the chances are that the person is going to take up the other side of the story inorder to balance out what I am arguing for. 

00:06:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Ok. 

00:06:35
JOHN WINSLADE When they are in a situation where that is, uhm, a possibility. 

00:06:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE ok. 

00:06:40
JOHN WINSLADE And if I argue strongly for one side and inadvertantly position somebody in a place where they are arguing for the other side then I am infact, uhm, pushing them... 

00:06:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:06:55
JOHN WINSLADE ...further into... 

00:07:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE opposite. 

00:07:00
JOHN WINSLADE ...a decision that really the opposite into what I want, want to intentionally create. 

00:07:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Ok. So, 

00:07:05
JOHN WINSLADE So therefore for me, sorry what are you gonna ask 

00:07:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE So what is the alternate of that? 

00:07:10
JOHN WINSLADE The alternate is to invite people to speak for both sides... 

00:07:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm. 

00:07:10
JOHN WINSLADE ...to explore both stories and full. 

00:07:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Ok. 

00:07:15
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm.And then not for me to make the decision about what's important even when it is something like suicide. 

00:07:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:07:25
JOHN WINSLADE Because, uhm, people don't get to the point where they are considering sucide to for no good reason. 

00:07:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:07:30
JOHN WINSLADE uhm, and those good reasons need to be heard and understood and explored, uhm, and I would also at the same time explore the other side of the story aswell. 

00:07:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Ok. 

00:07:40
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, and I am not suggesting that, that's the only kind of decision where this kind of conversation might apply but it is one of those context. 

00:07:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right, I, I just want to make sure that we are expressive about that. 

00:07:50
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:07:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE And because it's such a, uh, important, uh, topic to learn, just kind of brush over. 

00:07:55
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:08:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Where we started though, I mean, go back there is, uh, the other things that you want people to hear, uh, or look for, uh, and making a, when I listen to the tape, you know, you were practising, somewhere inbetween eating Broccoli for dinner and suicide... 

00:08:15
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. (laughs) 

00:08:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE ...(laughs)is there, uh,uh, something for people to notice? 

00:08:20
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Particularly I would want people to think in narrative terms and that is to see a decision as a development in a plot... 

00:08:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Ok. 

00:08:30
JOHN WINSLADE ...in a narrative. 

00:08:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Meaning? 

00:08:30
JOHN WINSLADE Meaning that it has, uhm, things that have gone before... 

00:08:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Ok. 

00:08:35
JOHN WINSLADE ...that have led up to this moment in the plot. It has things that have gone forward from it into the future... 

00:08:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:08:45
JOHN WINSLADE ...and making the decision involves, actually I think, uhm, exploring the possibilities of that future and projecting the kind of current situation and the current plot development forward and not only, I mean, I am specifying plot but it also involves character development, personal development... 

00:09:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:09:05
JOHN WINSLADE ...Stories that have character in them. 

00:09:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:09:05
JOHN WINSLADE That have history to them... 

00:09:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm 

00:09:05
JOHN WINSLADE ...and the present... 

00:09:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:09:10
JOHN WINSLADE ...and the future. 

00:09:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm. 

00:09:10
JOHN WINSLADE And they also have background sort of themes or cultural stories that are of influence aswell... 

00:09:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:09:15
JOHN WINSLADE ...that exist. And they too have their own history, their own present and their own possible future. 

00:09:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm. 

00:09:25
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, and I would like people to, to have a conversation with people around the decision that, uh, that opens up all of that territory for consideration. 

00:09:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm. So is the Narrative counselor would be wanting to explore goals, plots, build future, possible trajectories, the past, the traces, all those pieces would go into... 

00:09:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:09:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE ...that, to kind of give the decision more fully, uh, waded, uh, process, if you will. 

00:09:55
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. It's going to have a certain kind of (inaudible ) to that... 

00:10:01
LORRAINE HEDTKE ok. 

00:10:01
JOHN WINSLADE ...as we explore that fully. 

00:10:01
LORRAINE HEDTKE ok. 

00:10:01
JOHN WINSLADE But I am also interested in how the decisions as it's made reflects the person's, uhm, hopes and dreams and values... 

00:10:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:10:05
JOHN WINSLADE ...and beliefs and, uhm, their kind of, uhm, projected futures... 

00:10:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:10:15
JOHN WINSLADE ...what they want from themselves in life. 

00:10:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:10:15
JOHN WINSLADE And what other people want from them in life. 

00:10:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:10:20
JOHN WINSLADE And, and, you know, what they hold precious in their own experince. 

00:10:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. Ok. let's listen to that conversation then. 

00:10:30
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. 

00:10:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Ok. Thanks. 

00:10:30
The Conversation 

00:10:35
[sil.] 

00:10:35
JOHN WINSLADE Hi Lorraine. 

00:10:45
LORRAINE Hi Doctor. 

00:10:45
JOHN WINSLADE It's, uhm, I appreciate you coming and being willing to do this, uhm, especially because you are doing it on film so that people can see this. Right? 

00:10:55
LORRAINE Right. 

00:10:55
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. And the aim is that it could be used in classes or is an example of an exercise not necessairly the whole counseling conversation but one piece of them. 

00:11:05
LORRAINE Right. 

00:11:05
JOHN WINSLADE And so one piece of counseling that often comes is the, uhm, issue of making decisions about things as often, I am sure you, you have this experience in life that there are countless decisions known backgrounds that we have to make and that there are things that pull us in different directions as we try to make decisions. So, why don't you, uhm, have a conversation as an example of a decision making, uhm, exploration. Is that ok with you? 

00:11:40
LORRAINE Yes. 

00:11:40
JOHN WINSLADE Well, thank you. And, and I also want to ask you, you know, if there is anything that I ask you and, uhm, you feel uncomfortable about it, you, you steer me away from, from something that you are not comfortable on camera. Is that ok with you? 

00:11:55
LORRAINE That's fine. 

00:11:55
JOHN WINSLADE Great. So, tell me what kind of decision came to your mind, I'm interested in, tell me a little bit about what you thought of in that bringing on? 

00:12:10
LORRAINE Decision Making. Uhm, it, well, like you said we, we all have decisions that we need to make and sometimes after making the decision other ones appear that may never kind of thought of... 

00:12:25
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:12:25
LORRAINE ...or, you know, I saw as a consequence. Uhm. 

00:12:25
JOHN WINSLADE One decision leads to another one always. 

00:12:25
LORRAINE Right. That one tend to, sometimes it tends to be the harder one... 

00:12:30
JOHN WINSLADE Does it? 

00:12:30
LORRAINE ...that was behind it, uh, for me anyway. Uh... 

00:12:35
JOHN WINSLADE Sounds like you referring to and experienced it. 

00:12:35
LORRAINE Yes. 

00:12:40
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:12:40
LORRAINE Uhm, I recently, uh, decided to tell my mom that I am gay because... 

00:12:45
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:12:45
LORRAINE ...because I been, I started a relationship with someone... 

00:12:50
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:12:50
LORRAINE ...and uhm, in the past figured if I doesn't listen anybody then what my mom have to think. 

00:12:55
JOHN WINSLADE yes. 

00:12:55
LORRAINE Uhm,I initially take it hard. 

00:12:55
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:12:55
LORRAINE Uhm, so I expected all of that. 

00:13:00
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:13:00
LORRAINE So, I took, made that decision to do that. Now because of the fact that she is taking it harder she has I now need to take a decision whether or not I want to be a part of my family. Or if I want to pull away and begin my own family, so to speak. 

00:13:15
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:13:20
LORRAINE So, that's kind of where the decision that I may have to make right now as far as deciding whether or not, uhm, if I want to be continue to be a part of the family that I grown up with because, it's not that she is coming to terms with it but she wants to pretend that it doesn't exist. 

00:13:40
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:13:40
LORRAINE Uhm, which then does not allow, uhm, my significant person to be a part of my life in that sense. 

00:13:45
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:13:45
LORRAINE Uhm, so, it's kind of like a, let it be like you told me, I am working with it but don't exhibit it, don't bring it, don't make me accept it, uhm, because in my eyes it doesn't exist. 

00:14:00
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:14:00
LORRAINE And so for me it's July, move away from my family which it means a world to me. 

00:14:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:14:10
LORRAINE To make a life, new life. 

00:14:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:14:15
LORRAINE Uhm, or July, put that burden strain on my new relationship to continue of having the family life that I always had. 

00:14:25
JOHN WINSLADE Well. Ok. You can see there is quite an issue in there Lorraine, right? 

00:14:25
LORRAINE Yes. Yes. (inaudible )for all parties involved very deeply. 

00:14:32
All decisions have at least two sides and I want to make room for 

00:14:32
each to be taken seriously 

00:14:32
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. ok. Hmm. So, uhm, I am wondering as we explore this really we can look at sort of both sides of that, one side which is kind of like, uhm, uhm, I am working to maintain relationship with the family you care about. 

00:14:55
LORRAINE Right. 

00:14:55
JOHN WINSLADE And on the other side working to create a new life for youself and distance yourself from things in your family that will be hurtful and difficult for you and your partner. right? 

00:15:05
LORRAINE Right. 

00:15:05
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. It's kind of like one decision where the decision you are having to make kind of grows out of the decision that you had to make a little while ago. 

00:15:20
LORRAINE Right. 

00:15:20
JOHN WINSLADE whether or not to sort of speak to your mother about this, about your inventation(ph.) and gay identity and things like that. 

00:15:25
LORRAINE Right. 

00:15:30
JOHN WINSLADE Do you mind if I get back a little bit. Can I ask you a little bit about that? 

00:15:35
LORRAINE Sure. No problem. 

00:15:35
Inquiry into the back story that led up to the current decision 

00:15:35
JOHN WINSLADE So the, the kind of, the first decision was kind of like a .coming out decision, would you call that or is there anyother way to do? 

00:15:40
LORRAINE Yeah. yes. 

00:15:45
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. Uhm, and I am interested in what it was that brought you to make that decision, what was kind of persuasive for you that, that was a empowering(ph.) thing that you did? 

00:15:55
LORRAINE To actually make the coming out decision? 

00:16:00
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. Yes. 

00:16:00
LORRAINE My feelings for my partner and me wanting to have the unity, uhm... 

00:16:05
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:16:10
LORRAINE ...with them and with my family, uhm, because family is, family is very important to me. 

00:16:15
Honoring the best possible intention 

00:16:15
JOHN WINSLADE Ok.Yes. So you, you had a hope of unity. Is that right? 

00:16:20
LORRAINE Yes. Yes. 

00:16:20
JOHN WINSLADE Can you speak to me about that hope. What was the hope? 

00:16:25
Curiosity about detailed thinking behind earlier decision 

00:16:25
LORRAINE Uhm, well, you know, how our mistakes that we made and stuff, so , I figured that since my mom has accepted the way the way my siblings happy with their significant others... 

00:16:35
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:16:40
LORRAINE ...the good and the bad... 

00:16:40
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:16:40
LORRAINE ...that they brought in the family. 

00:16:40
JOHN WINSLADE So, you have given me a little bit of background about how your mom, I need to remember it. 

00:16:50
LORRAINE Yes. (laughs) 

00:16:50
JOHN WINSLADE And, and your mom has, uhm, responded to people as you referring to your brothers and sisters have brought into the family. 

00:17:00
LORRAINE Yes. Yes. 

00:17:00
JOHN WINSLADE And it seems that you were, you were saying, uhm, you were hoping with the history of what she is been through... 

00:17:10
LORRAINE Hmm-hmm. 

00:17:10
JOHN WINSLADE That, that, that it would be ruined for you and your partner even though it wouldn't necessarily been immediate or easy but you had this hope that, that she would be accepting and, and open and to you bringing your partner into the family? 

00:17:25
LORRAINE Right. 

00:17:25
JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

00:17:25
LORRAINE Right. 

00:17:25
JOHN WINSLADE So there are, it seems there are steps to this process, there are kind of, uh, one, one part is that formally bringing him in... 

00:17:35
LORRAINE Right. 

00:17:35
Breaking the decision down into a series of small steps 

00:17:35
JOHN WINSLADE ... and then this, I am imagining that there must be a informal part before that. Is that right? 

00:17:40
LORRAINE Yes. Uh, there is , you know. 

00:17:40
JOHN WINSLADE you went to unleash? 

00:17:40
LORRAINE Yes. Yes. There is this, you know, buying them to generic parties, you know,... 

00:17:45
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:17:45
LORRAINE ...interaction type thing, uhm, so that they, my family knows, my mom knows of them... 

00:17:55
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:17:55
LORRAINE ...or sees them or what, whatever the case may be and that's for any, anybody's fiance. 

00:18:00
JOHN WINSLADE Fiance. 

00:18:00
LORRAINE Yeah, 

00:18:00
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. Yes. And has that happened with you, with your partner before or is this the first time when you talked to him all about this? 

00:18:05
LORRAINE No. No. It happened before. 

00:18:10
JOHN WINSLADE Are you sure? 

00:18:10
LORRAINE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:18:10
JOHN WINSLADE So she had met your friend. 

00:18:10
LORRAINE She had met her, she had interacted with her, uhm, they headed off very well. 

00:18:15
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:18:15
LORRAINE Uhm, I thought that was one of the things that was going through me. 

00:18:20
JOHN WINSLADE That gave you a little more, it added to the hope. 

00:18:20
LORRAINE Right. Right. Uhm,because of the background, they were , uhm, uhm, both born in Mexico. They share this little town type thing. So, I was kind of hoping that would be something, uhm, especially since, she, my partners tends to be everything that my mom hopes for, in me if I mean any partner. 

00:18:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. What you think she was hoping? 

00:18:45
LORRAINE Well my mom has always told me to find someone who, uhm, shared the same likes that I had. 

00:18:50
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:18:55
LORRAINE Uhm, same, share the same type of, uhm, family value. 

00:19:00
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:19:00
LORRAINE Education. 

00:19:00
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:19:00
LORRAINE And always made me laugh. 

00:19:05
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:19:05
LORRAINE And so, so I thought If I present that to her that would be, you know, another name for her to , may be not being working with it but atleast given this an opportunity to be a part of the family. 

00:19:15
Inviting a rich account of how earlier decision was carried out 

00:19:15
JOHN WINSLADE Right. So, how did you go about, uhm, itroducing your, your partner to your mom? 

00:19:20
LORRAINE It was my birthday. 

00:19:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:19:25
LORRAINE She came over to my birthday dinner that my mom throws for me. 

00:19:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:19:25
LORRAINE Uhm, and, uhm, I just, it was, at that time we worked together. 

00:19:35
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:19:35
LORRAINE Uhm, and they just kind of headed off because my mom talking with all my friends and it was nothing but friends there... 

00:19:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:19:40
LORRAINE ...at the time so they just all, some of them already knew my mom obviously, interacted with her, uhm, they just, uhm, chose to grab a cup of coffee and she was sitting at the kitchen table well the rest of us were outside... 

00:19:55
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:19:55
LORRAINE ...and uhm. 

00:19:55
JOHN WINSLADE So you are sittnig kind of going all isnide of it. 

00:20:00
LORRAINE Hmm-hmm. 

00:20:00
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:20:00
LORRAINE Hmm-hmm. And the matter of fact the next day my mom even made a comment you know about, you know, whether speak to her or, you know,... 

00:20:10
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:20:10
LORRAINE I am not too sure about all the conversations was about. 

00:20:15
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:20:15
LORRAINE You know, she didn't. She actually remembered her. That's when it counts. 

00:20:20
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. That is important. 

00:20:20
LORRAINE That's when it counts. When my mom remembers a friend. 

00:20:20
JOHN WINSLADE She made room in her consciousness for your partner. 

00:20:25
LORRAINE Yes. Yes. 

00:20:25
JOHN WINSLADE Even though she didn't quite know that she was your partner at that moment. 

00:20:30
LORRAINE Exactly or potential to be my partner. 

00:20:30
JOHN WINSLADE Potential to be your partner. Right. Ok. Hmm.So what happened then? 

00:20:35
LORRAINE Uhm, after I told her? 

00:20:35
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. Well, I mean , you told me the part where she is having a conversation with your mom. 

00:20:40
LORRAINE Hmm-hmm. 

00:20:45
JOHN WINSLADE When did you tell her? 

00:20:45
LORRAINE I didn't tell her that day. It was a. 

00:20:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah that's what I heard? 

00:20:45
LORRAINE Yeah. It was a while after, after my partner and I secured more of our relationship, uhm, it was at a point where I wouldn't say pulling away uhm, it was more like I was starting to build the relationship which was, uhm, taking, you know, time, uhm... 

00:21:15
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:21:15
LORRAINE ...away from being able to, you know, uh, spend time with my mom,... 

00:21:15
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm. 

00:21:15
LORRAINE ...shopping, just going over to the house etc, and my mom always tends to know that there is something going on . 

00:21:25
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. Right. Ok. 

00:21:25
LORRAINE ...and so she was on that track. We were having lunch and ,uh, she was along the track of you know, you haven't been coming around lately, uhm, how are the... 

00:21:35
JOHN WINSLADE She knows something happening for you. 

00:21:35
LORRAINE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:21:40
JOHN WINSLADE That she knows you. Right. 

00:21:40
LORRAINE Yeah, she knows me very well and, uhm, she's like you do seem happy so I am not considering that there is something wrong which is like you don't have to tell me anything, uhm, if you don't want to because, uhm, you know... 

00:21:50
JOHN WINSLADE She had a sense that there is something you want to tell her. 

00:21:55
LORRAINE Yes. Yes. And so, uhm, I told her. 

00:22:00
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:22:00
LORRAINE With the whole intention in my head of, she is gonna, she is going to be ok with us. 

00:22:05
JOHN WINSLADE And what happened? 

00:22:05
LORRAINE It looked in my face. 

00:22:05
JOHN WINSLADE How did it blow up? 

00:22:10
LORRAINE She basically told me that, uhm, no daughter of her was going to be gay, uh, because she didn't raise us to be like that... 

00:22:15
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:22:15
LORRAINE ...and there was no way she would ever except my partner. And, uhm, if she would have know back then,then that,that was a potential... 

00:22:30
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:22:30
LORRAINE ...uhm, she probably would have thrown her out of the house, she doesn't want us to be around, uhm, her house. 

00:22:35
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:22:35
LORRAINE She hasn't allowed me to go back in. Uhm, she doesn't want, I, I have to take care of my niece and my nephew. 

00:22:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:22:40
LORRAINE And so she doesn't want us be together when I have my niece and my nephew. Uhm.... 

00:22:45
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. 

00:22:50
LORRAINE ...for purposes of whatever, I mean she just really went on and on and on about how she was never going to accept this and that, I can never force her to accept such a thing, idea. 

00:23:00
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. Ok. So that was a stronger kind of reaction that you were expecting? 

00:23:05
LORRAINE Yes. Very, very much of. 

00:23:05
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. And what, what impact did that had for you? 

00:23:10
Inquiry into the effects of earlier decision 

00:23:10
LORRAINE Uhm, wow for about, may be a month, I didn't talk to my mom which was a killer because I talk to my mom almost like daily basis. 

00:23:20
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:23:25
LORRAINE Uhm, it just killed me off on everything that I thought I knew about my mom... 

00:23:30
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:23:30
LORRAINE ...type of thing. 

00:23:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:23:30
LORRAINE Uhm, made me see her through a different light, uhm, almost to a point where even think that wasn't my mom, who taught me all those little things. 

00:23:40
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. Ok. Hmm. And I can see the look in your eyes as you speak about those things were pretty painful. 

00:23:45
LORRAINE Yes. Very much. 

00:23:50
Double listening to story of hope as well as pain 

00:23:50
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, it's kind of,uhm, you had big hopes and you had, uh, love for your mom and love for your partner as well. 

00:24:00
LORRAINE Hmm-hmm. 

00:24:00
JOHN WINSLADE Is that my (inaudible ) to my mouth or is that different? 

00:24:05
LORRAINE No that's(inaudible )truth. Yes. 

00:24:07
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:24:07
LORRAINE Yes. I, I love them both and if there I would actually, you know be able to, to teach other, she really and I told my mom this, she really is the daughter that all will hope for. Every comment that she ever made about the individuals that my brothers, the womens that my brothers used to bring with to the house.. 

00:24:30
JOHN WINSLADE Right.Hmm. 

00:24:30
LORRAINE ...she has bringed it out a characteristic of my partner. 

00:24:30
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. 

00:24:30
LORRAINE And it's like I know that they could be really good friends. 

00:24:35
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. If, if there was room... 

00:24:35
LORRAINE Right. 

00:24:35
JOHN WINSLADE ...in her heart full of it, possible... 

00:24:40
LORRAINE Right. 

00:24:40
JOHN WINSLADE Is there something you spoken with her. Have you said that to her? 

00:24:45
LORRAINE Yes. Yes. 

00:24:45
JOHN WINSLADE And, did she heared it? 

00:24:45
LORRAINE No. I don't think so. 

00:24:50
JOHN WINSLADE You don't think so. 

00:24:50
LORRAINE I don't think so. 

00:24:50
Deconstruction of the cultural story rather than blaming the person 

00:24:50
JOHN WINSLADE The kind of, uhm, uhm, uhm, the story of,uhm, being gay, being what unnatural being stronger for her at that point or something like that? or is there something like that? 

00:25:05
LORRAINE Yes. It was, it's a, it's a, uhm, unnatural, uhm, not,uhm, fulfilling for me or, at that so she sees it. 

00:25:15
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:25:15
LORRAINE She sees it's not fulfilling for me in a sense that, that takes away all what, the potential there is, uhm, I know she is traditional... 

00:25:25
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:25:25
LORRAINE ...and just, I guess, this traditional is that a point to say that, you know what the having a man in my life, you know, I would never succeed. 

00:25:35
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. 

00:25:35
LORRAINE Uhm, actually having a real partner. 

00:25:35
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:25:35
LORRAINE Uhm, That it's a man's strength that sometimes you know pushes this into that next level of womanhood. 

00:25:45
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Hmm. 

00:25:45
LORRAINE Uhm, trying to pick up the kids thing, which obviously shut her down with, uhm, in letting her I can give you grand kids if that's what she wanted, if that would made her happy but, uhm it, it, uhm, to her didn't, uh, make sense because she said, that we would not be a family. That we will always brings those kids into torment and torcher. 

00:26:05
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. Hmm. So. Ok that brings us upto this kind of current decision that you are facing which is, where do I go now with this. 

00:26:15
LORRAINE Right. 

00:26:15
JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

00:26:15
LORRAINE Right 

00:26:20
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. Hmm. So you are facing this decision of, do I, uhm, work at uhm, kind of retaining my realtionship with my family at this moment in this time or do I work at my relationship with my partner, let go a little of relationship with family at this time. Does that summarize you? 

00:26:40
LORRAINE Yes. 

00:26:40
John avoids positioning himself on either side by asking her to argue for both sides 

00:26:40
JOHN WINSLADE So, can I ask you about both sides of this dilemma, if you like? 

00:26:45
LORRAINE Hmm-hmm. 

00:26:45
JOHN WINSLADE Let's start with the side which is about, uhm,uhm, kind of moving, you putting distance between you and your mom? And, uhm, devoting more of your energy towards your partner. Right? 

00:27:00
LORRAINE Right. Hmm-hmm. 

00:27:00
JOHN WINSLADE What are the, what, what sort of, are the, uhm, arguments for that, for example, what, what would you say be the reasons for taking that side of the dilemma, if you like? 

00:27:15
LORRAINE Well, I would basically be happy. 

00:27:15
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:27:15
LORRAINE It will be my happiness first. 

00:27:20
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:27:20
LORRAINE Uhm, I would first be in the long term relationship of my life. 

00:27:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:27:25
LORRAINE Uhm, and the stepping stone into my own individual identity away from my family. 

00:27:30
Inquiry into relationship of each possible decision to core values 

00:27:30
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. Ok. And what's the importance of that to you? 

00:27:35
LORRAINE Uhm. 

00:27:35
JOHN WINSLADE It sounds like it's important. 

00:27:40
LORRAINE Yeah. It, it's just being able to finding the happy Phase of what I want. 

00:27:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:27:45
LORRAINE I tend to do a lot of, what my mom would want me to, kind to do, like, you know, trying to fit in with what's right with the family there. 

00:27:55
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:27:55
LORRAINE Uhm. 

00:27:55
JOHN WINSLADE So you kind of met your obligations through the years. 

00:27:55
LORRAINE Yes. Yes. 

00:28:00
JOHN WINSLADE And it doesn't sound like that's being a resentful thing, it's something (inaudible ), uhm, valued and it fits with things that are important to you. Right? 

00:28:06
LORRAINE Oh, it's may be, be the person that I am today. 

00:28:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:28:10
LORRAINE Yes. 

00:28:10
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. But on the other hand there is something that appeals to you about persuing this new life, if you like. 

00:28:20
LORRAINE Yes. 

00:28:20
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, because it offers something else, something, some other dimensions, some new dimensions for you, for who you can be and... 

00:28:25
LORRAINE Yes. 

00:28:25
JOHN WINSLADE ...is that...? 

00:28:25
LORRAINE Yes. It's, it's gonna be the creation of, of me. uhm, you know, it's gonna be the, the next step in my life on my own... 

00:28:35
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:28:35
LORRAINE ...even though, I,I been in it all, I've been on my own. 

00:28:40
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:28:40
LORRAINE I never felt like, I was actually going to begin a path... 

00:28:45
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. 

00:28:45
LORRAINE ...of my own. 

00:28:45
subjunctive inquiry into future dimensions of possible decision 

00:28:45
JOHN WINSLADE what would you be hoping to create for yourself in this new life? 

00:28:50
LORRAINE In my new life I would hope to actually create my own family. 

00:28:55
JOHN WINSLADE Your own family? 

00:28:55
LORRAINE Yeah. 

00:28:55
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. 

00:28:55
LORRAINE To begin my, a new career. 

00:28:55
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. 

00:28:55
LORRAINE To begin, you, know a new family, to be me. 

00:29:00
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. Those are big things. 

00:29:05
LORRAINE Yeah. 

00:29:05
Inviting her to situate herself in a possible future 

00:29:05
JOHN WINSLADE Also like to sort ofexpel those and kind of replace those and sort of invisioned that kind of future. 

00:29:10
LORRAINE It's actually kind of gets exciting. 

00:29:15
JOHN WINSLADE Is that? 

00:29:15
LORRAINE Scary and exciting. But exciting. 

00:29:15
JOHN WINSLADE Scary and exciting. 

00:29:15
LORRAINE Yesh. But more exciting because uhm, I never thought that would actually be a possibility. 

00:29:20
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:29:20
LORRAINE I never really invi..invisioned that, I've been focussed on, you know, doing my part in the family, uhm, to, you know, to keep us together, to, you know, be there for my mom... 

00:29:35
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. Alright. 

00:29:35
LORRAINE ...you know, the kids and stuff, that I never actually saw myself away from that type of mentality. 

00:29:40
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. ok. And now you are starting to sort of see that and invision that, I see the smile that comes on your face... 

00:29:45
LORRAINE (laughs). 

00:29:45
JOHN WINSLADE ...is that right? 

00:29:50
LORRAINE Yes. 

00:29:50
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:29:50
LORRAINE Yeah. 

00:29:50
John bears witness to the excitement associated with the possible decision 

00:29:50
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. And is exciting, and I mean, I catch a sense of the excitement that you had around there. 

00:29:55
LORRAINE Yeah. 

00:29:55
JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

00:29:55
LORRAINE Yes. 

00:29:55
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:29:55
Acknowledging the costs associated with possible decision 

00:29:55
LORRAINE But at the same time now the struggle is, if I pull away from my family, does that make me alone. I mean... 

00:30:05
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:30:05
LORRAINE ...I have somebody... 

00:30:05
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:30:05
LORRAINE ...but it's always been my family. 

00:30:05
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:30:05
LORRAINE You know, they have been the, the. 

00:30:10
JOHN WINSLADE And it sounds like your love for your family has changed. 

00:30:10
LORRAINE Right. 

00:30:10
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:30:15
LORRAINE Right. 

00:30:15
JOHN WINSLADE But it is still there. 

00:30:15
LORRAINE Right. 

00:30:15
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. Including you mom and she has, interestingly she has trusted you and you have been the one that is clsest to her always... 

00:30:20
LORRAINE Oh yeah. 

00:30:20
JOHN WINSLADE ...it sounded like. 

00:30:25
LORRAINE Oh, yeah, yeah. 

00:30:25
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:30:25
LORRAINE Her and I are the, the closest. 

00:30:25
JOHN WINSLADE One like that. 

00:30:25
LORRAINE Hmm-hmm. 

00:30:25
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:30:25
LORRAINE Hmm-hmm. 

00:30:25
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:30:25
LORRAINE and like I said, I, I want to make sure that I am, I guess doing right by her, uhm, in a sense of like showing her that I can have that strong family value that she placed in me. 

00:30:40
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:30:40
LORRAINE But she doesn't approve for the family that I am trying to hopefully make and have. 

00:30:45
Inquiry into the arguments for the other possible decision 

00:30:45
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. Hmm. So, let me ask a little bit about the other side of that. 

00:30:45
LORRAINE Ok. 

00:30:50
JOHN WINSLADE If you were to make the decision of putting more energy into the storing the realtionship with your mom... 

00:30:55
LORRAINE Hmm-hmm. 

00:30:55
JOHN WINSLADE ...and with your family. Uhm, what would that be like? What, what arguments are there for that story? 

00:31:00
LORRAINE Well, if, if I go more and putting back into my mom I, I had that structure... 

00:31:05
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:31:05
LORRAINE ...the balance that I always had, uhm, 

00:31:10
JOHN WINSLADE Is that kind of relying on? 

00:31:10
LORRAINE Right, uhm, but I, I have that structure and I, I can rely on that I just feel it would take away from the partnership. 

00:31:20
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. You, you perhaps some would loose something of the possibilities that you spoke about on the other side. 

00:31:30
LORRAINE Right. 

00:31:30
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:31:30
LORRAINE Right. Because we can never be a full part of each others lifes. 

00:31:35
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:31:35
LORRAINE Uhm, and I know my partner wouldn't have a problem with me picking that because she is very familiar to that aswell. 

00:31:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:31:40
LORRAINE Uhm,but it would, I, I. 

00:31:45
JOHN WINSLADE She would understand. 

00:31:45
LORRAINE Yes. 

00:31:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:31:45
LORRAINE But I could still see a strain being put on that relationship. 

00:31:50
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:31:50
LORRAINE Because I would have to , you know, having a lot of, having a big family and having a lot of family parties. 

00:31:55
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:31:55
LORRAINE You know, be able to be like, wow I'll be gone this weekend because I will be at a family party of my mom or my mom will be there so therefore you can't come. 

00:32:00
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. Hmm. 

00:32:05
LORRAINE You know, and I, I know that in time that would put a lot of strain... 

00:32:05
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:32:05
LORRAINE ...on it. 

00:32:10
Summarizing builds a platform for moving forward into decision-making 

00:32:10
JOHN WINSLADE So, if I can sort of summarize we, were at in this conversation right now... 

00:32:15
LORRAINE Hmm-hmm 

00:32:15
JOHN WINSLADE ...and what you told me about is that you made one decision which was, the kind of, uhm, initial, kind of coming out kind of decision... 

00:32:20
LORRAINE Right. 

00:32:25
JOHN WINSLADE ...and you had hopes for, that it would kind of work well, it didn't quite go well as you wanted to... 

00:32:30
LORRAINE (laughs) No. 

00:32:30
JOHN WINSLADE ...infact it was disappointing... 

00:32:30
LORRAINE Yes. 

00:32:35
JOHN WINSLADE ...infact how it did happen. Uhm, now you face for the next decision which is, kind of, ok, where do I go from here, how, where do I put my energy in my relationships with my, with the people that I care about and love... 

00:32:45
LORRAINE Right. 

00:32:45
JOHN WINSLADE ...when those things are not easily coming together, they are not, they are not working in a complete way, the word you use is unity... 

00:32:55
LORRAINE Hmm-hmm. 

00:32:55
JOHN WINSLADE ...that you would like. And I am imagining that as you contemplate that decision you also looking at, ok whatever decision that I make now amongst down the road there would be another one. 

00:33:10
LORRAINE (laughs) Yes. 

00:33:10
JOHN WINSLADE (laughs) Like this is an ongoing process, it's not gonna sort of suddenly be resolved immediately. 

00:33:15
LORRAINE Right. 

00:33:15
JOHN WINSLADE Is that, is that fair enough? Is that, I'm, I'm sort of summarizing and also speculating a little bit here and there. 

00:33:25
LORRAINE Yes. 

00:33:25
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:33:25
LORRAINE Now, not one I am kind of want to look at right now but, yes I am pretty sure after that there will be another... 

00:33:30
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm 

00:33:30
LORRAINE ...you know, uhm, deci...decision that would be need to be made... 

00:33:30
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:33:30
LORRAINE ...after I get over the, which path I took. 

00:33:35
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. 

00:33:35
LORRAINE I, either way I, I do see some pain... 

00:33:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. Yes. 

00:33:40
LORRAINE ...either for, both for me and for either my mom or my significant. 

00:33:45
JOHN WINSLADE Atleast in immediate future. 

00:33:45
LORRAINE Yes. 

00:33:50
Inviting her to weight up the effects of her own arguments 

00:33:50
JOHN WINSLADE You don't know what the long term thing but, uhm, and so I am interested in, first of all as we have been talking what's been happening in our conversation which has been happenig inside you about this kind of dilemma, this sort of decision that you are facing as it sort of being, as you talked about, kind of, as it sort of, which way you are leaving or kind of which, which is pulling you the most or where is your decision making heading as you think about this as we talk about it? 

00:34:20
LORRAINE As, as we talk about it in, in remembering why the relationship with my mother is so important... 

00:34:25
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:34:25
LORRAINE ...I, I think that's what making me lean in a sense going towards that new life... 

00:34:30
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. 

00:34:30
LORRAINE ...because had it been a, a male that I would, you know, told her about I think that she would have asked or pushed for me to work on that. 

00:34:40
JOHN WINSLADE She would have, she would have wanted that. 

00:34:40
LORRAINE Yes. 

00:34:45
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:34:45
LORRAINE Because I know that, you know, from the times that I have grown, as growing up one of the things that she used to always tells us was that, her fear would be that, you know, if she passed away that we would be left with no one in our life to, you know, share our pain with or share our laughter with. 

00:35:00
Re-membering her mother's words 

00:35:00
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. So you remember her wisdom from that... 

00:35:05
LORRAINE Hmm. 

00:35:05
JOHN WINSLADE ...from that perspective. 

00:35:05
LORRAINE Right. And that's why I think I need to put her and family on pause to actually see if that's the, you know, the happiness that I am going to gain from it. 

00:35:15
Keeping multiple possible stories open 

00:35:15
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. And the way you are using this pause rather than, you know, right out of the picture. Right. 

00:35:25
LORRAINE I don't want that to happen but, I mean, it is not possible. 

00:35:25
JOHN WINSLADE You are not totally in control what happens. Right. 

00:35:30
LORRAINE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:35:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. So it's not all your decision in the end. 

00:35:30
LORRAINE Right. 

00:35:35
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:35:35
LORRAINE Right. 

00:35:35
Double listening keeps multiple possible stories open 

00:35:35
JOHN WINSLADE But you, if I understand you right you are saying that, I would like to embrace this new direction in my life... 

00:35:40
LORRAINE Right. 

00:35:40
JOHN WINSLADE ...but also make sure that my heart remains open to my family and especially to my mom. 

00:35:45
LORRAINE Right. 

00:35:50
JOHN WINSLADE Is that a fair summary? 

00:35:50
LORRAINE Yes. 

00:35:50
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:35:50
LORRAINE In a sense because I would push the same on her behalf. 

00:35:55
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Hmm. And I guess if we have more time I might explore how you might go about that and we would kind of talk about detail of how that would look on the ground as you were to do that. Uhm, in that I guess is where, you know, the decisions and dilemmas would, would arise, perhaps how you would go about that. 

00:36:15
LORRAINE Right. 

00:36:15
Reflexive question about decision-making folds another layer into conversation 

00:36:15
JOHN WINSLADE We are, we are not going to have time to do that at this point but let me ask you before you do that What's your experience of talking about this today. How, how was this conversation? 

00:36:30
LORRAINE It actually has helped me hear out, uhm, why it's difficult for me. 

00:36:35
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:36:35
LORRAINE Uhm,I, I thought it was a matter of being pulled in directions. 

00:36:40
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:36:40
LORRAINE But it, it's a matter of, uhm, actually finding myself again. 

00:36:45
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. 

00:36:45
LORRAINE uhm, finding why it bothers me so much, uhm, in a sense of like, uhm, the reason I am pulled in, being pulled is because, you know, of the values that my mom instilled in me. 

00:37:00
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:37:00
LORRAINE And so, I guess, if I never learned those types of values from her I, it wouldn't matter, it would be something that would be easy and I... 

00:37:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:37:10
LORRAINE ...just would pick you the one. 

00:37:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. It's kind of, it's sounds like, you are talking about this is being helpful in terms of understanding, kind of, how can you be pulled, so to speak. 

00:37:25
LORRAINE Right. 

00:37:25
JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

00:37:25
LORRAINE Yes. I didn't, I didn't realise that. 

00:37:25
Invites reflection on what has been most important in this conversation 

00:37:25
JOHN WINSLADE And what difference does that make to realise that. 

00:37:30
LORRAINE Because it, it helps reinforce and proves what I try to tell my mom that I am the person that she raised. 

00:37:35
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. 

00:37:40
LORRAINE I haven't changed. 

00:37:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:37:40
LORRAINE Uhm, and I did listen to everything that she ever told me than and... 

00:37:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:37:45
LORRAINE ...I am fulfilling what she expected from me... 

00:37:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:37:45
LORRAINE ... in, in my growingup life. 

00:37:50
JOHN WINSLADE In a way that you choose to do that. 

00:37:50
LORRAINE Right. 

00:37:55
JOHN WINSLADE Well, thank you Lorraine for sharing for what is a very intimate decision in one that has a powerful sort of impact on who you are and also expressess something that, that, that's, that's speaks to who you are, that's speaks to what's important to you, that's speaks to how you are seeking to honour some quite complex, uhm, threads of value in your own life and I appreciate the fact that you shared those things with me at this time. 

00:38:25
LORRAINE Oh, you are very welcome. 

00:38:30
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. Thank you. 

00:38:30
LORRAINE Welcome. 

00:38:35
[sil.] 

00:38:35
An Externalizing Conversation 

00:38:35
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. Well, Hi Donna. 

00:38:45
DONNA Hello. 

00:38:45
JOHN WINSLADE And thank you for willing to do this today. 

00:38:45
DONNA Thank you for having me. 

00:38:50
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, and one thing that I would like to just, uhm, speak to you before we start is that because there are people watching this video I would like you to have a sense that you can shape and control what you talk about and that you don't feel compelled to, uhm, go down to anything that I may ask you about, uhm, but feel free to, to steer me away in a different direction if you don't, if you don't comfortable with what I am asking you. Is that ok. 

00:39:15
DONNA That's ok. Yes. 

00:39:20
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. And, uhm, what we are doing is, uhm, not a whole counseling conversation it's piece of it, and in this particular example we are going to explore An Externalizing Conversation. Uhm, which will become clear as we go through it. Is that alright? 

00:39:40
DONNA Yes it is. 

00:39:40
JOHN WINSLADE So what I ask you to, to think of inorder to give us the chance to do that is something like a habit. Some, you know, it can be some small habit, whatever, uhm, that you would like to make some difference to? 

00:39:55
DONNA Ok. 

00:39:55
JOHN WINSLADE Is that ok? 

00:40:00
DONNA That's ok. Yes. 

00:40:00
JOHN WINSLADE So can we start by asking like what sort of thing came to your mind when I asked you that? 

00:40:05
DONNA Well the first thing that came to my mind is somthing that I have been trying to work on for probably a few years and I try to stay away from it and inspite of it, it always comes back is "Tardiness" 

00:40:15
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. Ok. tardiness. 

00:40:20
DONNA Yes. 

00:40:20
Asking Donna for meaning rather than making assumptions 

00:40:20
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. Alright. So tell me about what that means to you because it means different things to different people, I am sure. 

00:40:25
DONNA To me it's being late to any type of activity, event, work, school, anything where I required to be somewhere at a certain time, I find, even two or three minutes late it causes stress to me trying to get there right on time or not, if not five to ten minutes before, it starts. 

00:40:40
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:40:45
DONNA And I feel like I am always running up againsst that clock and showing up five minutes late, ten minutes late and even though, even though I am not significantly late... 

00:40:55
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:40:55
DONNA ...I still do not like being there even five minutes late after I am supposed to be. 

00:40:55
Clarifying question 

00:40:55
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. So, I hear the story of stress, uhm, about sort of not being and I am wondering like does it end up that you are late or. 

00:41:10
DONNA Uhm, most of the time, yeah. (laughs) 

00:41:15
JOHN WINSLADE I (laughs). Ok. And is that what you mean by habit? The habit that you are in, as if, kind of getting there a bit too late or something? 

00:41:20
DONNA Correct. Yes. 

00:41:20
Locating the problem story in a context 

00:41:20
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. So when is that being important? 

00:41:25
DONNA It's, it's important for work, uhm,... 

00:41:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:41:30
DONNA ...that I will be there on time and I tend to get away with being five minutes late to work sometimes because so everybody else is always late, so aslong as I can get there before my boss then, it, it tends to go unnoticed. 

00:41:40
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. 

00:41:45
DONNA But, that's, I think that's where it stresses me out the most is that I am late to work. 

00:41:45
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. 

00:41:45
DONNA It's an issue of oversleeping or not getting up in a timely manner and trying to get there in time and traffic and there is a lot of things that kind of factor in what make me late. 

00:41:55
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Yeah. There's lof of contrbuting... 

00:42:00
DONNA Correct. 

00:42:00
JOHN WINSLADE ...factors to tardiness for you, like one of them is sleeping, one of them is, what were saying is? 

00:42:05
DONNA Traffic. 

00:42:05
JOHN WINSLADE Traffic. 

00:42:05
DONNA Or. May be, may be sleeping too long and traffic. It's those two things that will get me into trouble. 

00:42:10
Inquiring into the breadth of the problem which is externalized as "it" 

00:42:10
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. Hmm-hmm. So, what concerned me, does it affect anything else? 

00:42:15
DONNA Uhm, if I am late to events like family functions, family events, uhm, my family is very punctual for the most part... 

00:42:25
JOHN WINSLADE Oh, really. Ok. 

00:42:25
DONNA ...and (laughs) if I show up late, I feel like all eyes are on me, I, I think I make more of a issue out of it than it actually is but... 

00:42:35
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. 

00:42:35
DONNA ...that's an other area where it, it does bother me. 

00:42:35
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. So, work and family events anywhere else? 

00:42:40
DONNA Events for friends. 

00:42:40
JOHN WINSLADE With friends as well. 

00:42:40
DONNA Anytime somebody is depending on me to be there at a certain time and if I am even slightly late it's, it's an issue for me. 

00:42:50
JOHN WINSLADE It becomes an issue. 

00:42:50
DONNA Yeah. 

00:42:50
Inquiry into effects of problem on other people 

00:42:50
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. For you and for other people? 

00:42:55
DONNA I think it's probably more of an issue for me than it is for other people. 

00:43:00
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. 

00:43:00
DONNA I, I don't like to be known as the person that is always late. 

00:43:05
Double listening hears a problem story and a preferred story 

00:43:05
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. So, it challenges something that is, something that you would like to be known as. 

00:43:10
DONNA Yes. (laughs) 

00:43:10
Tardiness is externalized and its historical effdcts mapped 

00:43:10
JOHN WINSLADE So, let me ask you about, uhm, what are the effects of tardiness in your life, in your experience? What, like, uhm, I am thinking about in the past, first of all and then we talk about the present and may be the future aswell. 

00:43:25
DONNA Uhm, well, let me see in the past, uhm, one time I was late, I, I really overslept for a work function, It was like a, a rewarding activity when I was back in college, I was working at a restaurant as a waitress and as a lead server and they had an activity for all of us to, all the lead servers to go to Catalina Island... 

00:43:50
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:43:50
DONNA ...for the day, so, kind of like a reward. 

00:43:55
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:43:55
DONNA And we had to be in Long Beach where the boat docked, I think at eight in the morning and I completely overslept, I think my goal was to be up and out of the house by six thirty and then I wake up to seven O'clock, so, 

00:44:10
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. 

00:44:10
DONNA Just threw clothes on, rushed out of the door, drove as fast as I could on to Long Beach and barely made it, once the, the boat was literally about to pull out and I barely made it. 

00:44:20
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. 

00:44:25
DONNA But, uhm, there was really no consequence I, because I made the actual event but that was probably one of the biggest close stand. 

00:44:30
JOHN WINSLADE Close stands out in your memories if you think about the, the history of this habit in your experience. 

00:44:35
DONNA Correct. Yeah. 

00:44:35
JOHN WINSLADE Any, any other examples of, of, of your memory from the past where this is been an important issue that affected you? 

00:44:40
DONNA Uhm, just with jobs may be being told by supervisor, you know, instead of running in the door at, if you are scheduled to start at you know, instead of running in the door at eight a.m. you need to be at your best to work at eight a.m. So,... 

00:44:55
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. 

00:44:55
DONNA ...been reprimanded I would take it like. 

00:45:00
JOHN WINSLADE So that's an affect that's, you know, you being reprimanded. 

00:45:05
DONNA Yeah. 

00:45:05
Mapping the future effects of "this habit" 

00:45:05
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. hmm-hmm. And, if, let's first go forward into the future, uhm, what I am gonna expect would be some ongoing effects of this habit for you, if you were keep doing things exactly as they happen at the moment and, and you end being a few minutes late often. What do you expect the future of it? 

00:45:20
DONNA I could continue to see it being an issue at work... 

00:45:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:45:25
DONNA ...especially if I have a boss that's very punctual. 

00:45:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:45:30
DONNA Like I said earlier, uhm, it's not a big issue at my job right now because everybody else is late so aslong as I can get before them it's goes in as it is. 

00:45:35
JOHN WINSLADE Right. So, there, there is a little relief there. 

00:45:40
DONNA Correct. 

00:45:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Hmm. 

00:45:40
DONNA But if I have a job where being punctual is expected every single day if it's supposed to start at eight a.m. I need to be ready to work at eight a.m. uhm, if I can't do that or if I have trouble doing that then I expect that to be an issue and it should be, I mean, that's. 

00:45:55
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. Ok. So, like if you had a job which had more responsibility for example Or... 

00:46:00
DONNA Uhm. 

00:46:00
JOHN WINSLADE ...more expectations that you there on time... 

00:46:00
DONNA Correct. Yeah. 

00:46:00
JOHN WINSLADE ...or be more consequences for being late that, that would have a bigger effect. 

00:46:05
DONNA Yes. 

00:46:05
Summarizing and mapping the breadth of the effects 

00:46:05
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. Ok. So, uhm, have the effects been, uhm, you know, the kind of the breadth of the effects, like, you know, how widely they have, they have gone in your life because you are talking about some of the effects in terms of, uhm, being reprimanded. 

00:46:25
DONNA Hmm-hmm. 

00:46:25
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, interms of how you think about yourself, uhm, interms of family being unhappy with you, anyother kind of ways in which this is, kind of, spread out through your life? 

00:46:35
DONNA No, It hasn't. It hasn't really affected my life, like I said, when I am late it is usually five or ten minutes, it's nothing major. 

00:46:45
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. 

00:46:45
DONNA It hasn't gone to the point where I have completely messed something that.. 

00:46:50
JOHN WINSLADE You even made that boat on time. 

00:46:50
DONNA Barely made the boat. Yeah. 

00:46:55
JOHN WINSLADE Barely. But you made it. Yeah. 

00:46:55
DONNA So, it hasn't had any major, major impact. 

00:46:55
Inviting story of agency against the externalized problem 

00:46:55
JOHN WINSLADE So, would you say you stopped it from getting worse? 

00:47:00
DONNA I have stopped it from getting worse. Yeah. But I haven't fully corrected it. 

00:47:05
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. So, how did you stopped it from getting worse? 

00:47:05
DONNA Uhm, well, I mean, I haven't let it really become a point where I am like an hour late or two hours late. So, it's. 

00:47:15
JOHN WINSLADE Some people do. Right? 

00:47:20
DONNA Yeah. 

00:47:20
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah? 

00:47:20
DONNA Yeah. Some people do 

00:47:20
JOHN WINSLADE So, how did you stopped it from being like that for you? 

00:47:20
DONNA Just trying to wake up earlier or maybe trying to tell myself like if I am supposed to be there at eight O'clock, I need to tell myself to be there at seven thirty 

00:47:35
JOHN WINSLADE So, you sort of trick yourself a little bit. 

00:47:35
DONNA Trick myself or actually another thing in that, actually just comes to mind right now is I set all my clocks ahead. 

00:47:40
JOHN WINSLADE Do you? 

00:47:40
DONNA Yeah. It drives my husband crazy because they are all different. So, (laughs)... 

00:47:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. Yes. 

00:47:45
DONNA ...and I know what they are but my bedroom clock is like thirty minutes ahead, the clock downstairs is twenty minutes ahead and the clock in my car is eight minutes ahead, so, all set in ahead but then I know how far ahead they are, so, I know. 

00:48:00
JOHN WINSLADE So, you, kind of undo your own trick almost at the end. 

00:48:05
DONNA (laughs) 

00:48:05
Inviting a story of how she opposes the externalized problem and its effects 

00:48:05
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. Do you have anyother methods of, uhm, of kind of preventing it from getting to the point where it, it gets worse? 

00:48:10
DONNA No. I think that is the only thing that I have done so far. 

00:48:10
Looking for exceptions 

00:48:10
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. You were mentioning that there must be time when you do get there on time, that you are not late. 

00:48:15
DONNA Yes. 

00:48:15
JOHN WINSLADE So, it's not kind of all the time that this habit actually that has control of yours. Sometimes... 

00:48:25
DONNA It goes in spurts(ph.) 

00:48:25
JOHN WINSLADE Does it? 

00:48:25
DONNA Yes. 

00:48:25
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. How, how does that work? Clear us What that means? 

00:48:30
DONNA Uhm, work as an example that I can use and I have notice, uhm, since I have been school and having evening classes, uhm, I have to be at work at seven a.m. in the morning. So... 

00:48:40
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:48:40
DONNA ...uhm, when I go to school I get home at ten, ten thirty at night and I try to get on bed as soon as possible, uhm, but it's been more difficult to wake up on time... 

00:48:50
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:48:50
DONNA ...in the morning to go to work when I have evening classes. So... 

00:48:55
JOHN WINSLADE yes. 

00:48:55
DONNA ...I noticed for the past couple months actually, uhm, I have been five minutes late to work more often than when I was in school and I was getting plenty of sleep, I could be there, you know, five minutes early. So, I tend to notice that. 

00:49:10
Double listening contrasts two stories 

00:49:10
JOHN WINSLADE So one of the spurt would be, uh, uh, you tend like two spurts one being the spurt later and another spurt which is kind of being on time. 

00:49:20
DONNA Yes. 

00:49:20
JOHN WINSLADE And the same goes with spurts you hear both of those things. Is that right? 

00:49:25
DONNA Yeah.I'll have spurts if I'll be on time all the time and I know how many problems I have. 

00:49:30
JOHN WINSLADE Those are the times when you get more sleep and you plan it better, something like that, right? 

00:49:30
DONNA Yes. 

00:49:30
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. An...another times, you, the spurts, the, sort of life happens and ways and leaving you with less opportunities for sleep and... 

00:49:40
DONNA Yes. 

00:49:40
JOHN WINSLADE ...it's more likely that you be later. 

00:49:45
DONNA Correct. Yes. 

00:49:45
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. Hmm. So, ok, so, there are sometimes when you are on time in spurts. 

00:49:50
DONNA Hmm-hmm. 

00:49:50
JOHN WINSLADE And then there are times when you have the other spurt where you kind of, uhm, uhm, running late more often. 

00:50:00
DONNA Yes. 

00:50:00
JOHN WINSLADE Which one are you in at the moment? 

00:50:00
DONNA The late spurt (laughs) 

00:50:00
JOHN WINSLADE The late spurt (laughs) 

00:50:05
DONNA Yeah. 

00:50:05
Searching for unique outcomes 

00:50:05
JOHN WINSLADE So, within that late spurt, uhm, are you late everyday? Or there are sometimes when you, I am thinking of work? 

00:50:10
DONNA Yeah, uhm, yeah, I have been about five to ten minutes late everyday for the past month or so. 

00:50:20
JOHN WINSLADE For the past month? 

00:50:20
DONNA Yeah. 

00:50:20
JOHN WINSLADE And hasn't, hasn't been even one day when you been in there even once sometime. 

00:50:25
DONNA (laughs) I don't think so. 

00:50:25
JOHN WINSLADE You don't think so. Ok. 

00:50:25
DONNA No. 

00:50:25
JOHN WINSLADE When was the last time when you got there? 

00:50:30
DONNA Uhm, hmm, Gosh, I don't, I mean, may be over a month ago I was probably there righ at seven a.m. 

00:50:35
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. 

00:50:35
DONNA Six fifty nine, seven a.m. 

00:50:40
Asking for an account of the unique outcome 

00:50:40
JOHN WINSLADE So, what did you do different that day? 

00:50:40
DONNA I woke up earlier, I, I, uhm, set my alarm for five thirty in the morning because it takes me about twenty five to thiry minutes to get to work, but usually I sneeze it and sneeze it and sneeze it until... 

00:50:50
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. 

00:50:50
DONNA ...finally six o'clock comes around and I know that I have to be up orelse I definately be late, so, when I go through this spurt right Iam on time I won't sneeze as many times so, I will be up at five fourty or five fourty five and it's easier to get up. 

00:51:05
JOHN WINSLADE So, that'a the piece of knowledge that you have that helps you counter... 

00:51:10
DONNA Yes. 

00:51:10
JOHN WINSLADE ...your tardiness because you, kind of don't use the... 

00:51:15
DONNA Sneeze. 

00:51:15
JOHN WINSLADE ...sneeze button so many times. Right. 

00:51:15
DONNA Instead of sneezing it three times like I usually do, I'll know that after that second sneeze that I have to get out. 

00:51:20
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. Hmm. So, has there been any occasions recently when you done that and kind of got up after the second sneeze button? 

00:51:30
DONNA Uh, yes. And (laughs) I got back to the second sneeze button but that particular day I have to wash my hair. So, I ended up taking longer to getting ready and I still there be late for work. 

00:51:45
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. Ok. 

00:51:45
DONNA It's. It's. 

00:51:45
JOHN WINSLADE It sounded like you are annoyed with yourself. 

00:51:50
DONNA Very annoyed. 

00:51:50
JOHN WINSLADE You did, into this effort of getting up after the first, after the second sneeze button as the sneeze alarm went off and then you, for some other reason you ended still being tardy. 

00:51:55
DONNA Yes. 

00:52:00
Widening the search for resistance to the problem 

00:52:00
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. So, do you have anyother, uhm, strategies that you use, that kind of help you to overcome and fight against the tardiness happen? 

00:52:10
DONNA Uhm, just once that I mentioned about trying to set my clocks ahead or trying to tell myself I have to be there earlier than I actually have to be. 

00:52:20
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. Alright. 

00:52:20
DONNA And sometimes they work and sometimes they don't, you know. 

00:52:20
Seeking possible future unique outcomes 

00:52:20
JOHN WINSLADE Sometimes they don't. Yeah. so, do you , I mean, do you have anyother kind of ideas that you are entertaining about how you might in future, kind of counte this effects of this happen? 

00:52:30
DONNA Just continuing to do what I do and hopefully it eventually starts to work permanantly. 

00:52:40
JOHN WINSLADE So, you are kind of hoping that it will start to work? 

00:52:45
DONNA Hoping that I will get so annoyed with myself that I will get to a point where it, I know that I have to be up and out of bed at five fourty five or else I am not going to get to work on time. 

00:52:55
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. Alright. 

00:52:55
DONNA Instead of when I see the clock and it says five fourty five, sayin well I will sneeze it one more time because I am really tired so , I can get that extra ten minutes to sleep and... 

00:53:05
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. Ok. 

00:53:05
DONNA ...I could still rush to get their on time but it doesn't work that way. 

00:53:10
JOHN WINSLADE So, is that something that you do when you get annoyed with yourself? 

00:53:10
DONNA Very annoyed with myself. That's usually, I have to get to a breaking point of annoyance with myself before I can really change it. 

00:53:20
Inviting the expression of arguments for the counter story 

00:53:20
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. Alright. So, tell me as you get annoyed with yourself what would you say to yourself? 

00:53:25
DONNA That I am making myself look irresponsible and, uhm, like I said it hadn't got to a point where it is affecting my job but it's just more of how I am perceiving. I don't wanted to perceive that's a irresponsible person thats why he is running late. 

00:53:40
Externalizing the competing stories as voices in a debate 

00:53:40
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. It, I mean, it sounds to me like a debate, you know, going on with you. Right. 

00:53:45
DONNA Yes. 

00:53:45
JOHN WINSLADE One, one voice is saying don't worry everyone else is late, uhm, it won't affect your job, it's not that bigger deal, then the other voice is saying, no that's not right you are being irresponsible, is that right? 

00:53:55
DONNA Yes. It's absolutely right. 

00:54:00
JOHN WINSLADE That kind of debate goes on inside your head always. 

00:54:00
DONNA Yes. 

00:54:00
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. Hmm. And, uhm, I am wondering kind of, how you, thinking about growing, because it sounds like, you know, you think about the debate, you making, you thinking about making anyways, some choices about how to grow that other side the voice that says, no I want to be more responsible. 

00:54:20
DONNA Yeah. Yeah. 

00:54:20
JOHN WINSLADE Am I right. 

00:54:20
DONNA Yeah, you are right. Yes. 

00:54:25
JOHN WINSLADE And. Uhm, we haven't got that much time to explore that but I just want to ask you one more thing about that. If that is ok? 

00:54:30
DONNA Sure. 

00:54:30
Growing the counter story 

00:54:30
JOHN WINSLADE And that is, how might you grow the strength of that voice that says, uhm, the one, the one that says I want to be responsible? Because it sounds like that's your preference. 

00:54:45
DONNA It is. I think just continuing to tell myself that I need to be better on it, I think that will eventually make the difference. 

00:54:55
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. 

00:54:55
DONNA It's, I don't want to ever get to a point where it does effect my performance in a certain way and somebody, if it gets to a point where somebody actually have to tell me something about it that's where, that's when It's really going to upset me and I don't ever wanted to get to that point. 

00:55:10
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. Ok. So, those are the things that you are going to tell yourself, that, that help you, I mean, is that persuasive when you hear youself say that? 

00:55:20
DONNA Yeah. It is, it is, I guess.(laughs) 

00:55:25
Double listening: the word : "but" often indicates competing story 

00:55:25
JOHN WINSLADE But. Always, always the other side pulls you the other way. 

00:55:25
DONNA It's, it's like as you said is the debate with... 

00:55:30
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:55:30
DONNA ...I know my boss doesn't get there till seven fifteen so why do I have to be there at seven o'clock. Even though I want to be the responsible person that's there on time. 

00:55:35
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:55:35
DONNA It, it always is that debate and when sleep is overcoming you and you are exhausted and you know that just an extra ten more minutes sleep is going to be nice. 

00:55:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:55:45
DONNA It's, it's really hard to, you know, motivate yourself. 

00:55:50
JOHN WINSLADE So that voice is strong and persuasive too. 

00:55:50
DONNA It is. Yeah. 

00:55:55
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. We gonna pause in a second. I just want to ask you before we pause What's it like talking about this? 

00:56:00
DONNA Uhm, I'ts, it's interesting talking about it. It's, it's nice to kind of get, to realise how much it does bother me because when I am, just having this debate internally I tend to not really focus on what an issue would it become. 

00:56:15
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:56:15
DONNA And I just push it aside but speaking about it, it brings it to my attention a little bit more that it is something that I need to work on. 

00:56:25
JOHN WINSLADE Is that a good thing to bring to your attention? 

00:56:25
DONNA Yes. Yeah. It's something... 

00:56:25
JOHN WINSLADE Why Is it so important? 

00:56:25
DONNA It's something that I wanted to change upon myself. 

00:56:30
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. Hmm. So, am I right in hearing you saying, I wanted to get more serious about this? 

00:56:35
DONNA Yes. 

00:56:35
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. Ok. Well, we could go on and I could explain many more things about this but I think this is probably a good point to stop and I want to thank you Donna for sharing this story of a habit that, that has an impact on you and you sort of contemplating making some changes and getting more serious about. So, thank you very much in sharing that with me. 

00:56:55
DONNA You're welcome. 

00:56:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE What I would like to talk about is, kind of, couple pieces of commentary what just happened between Donna and you. 

00:57:05
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:57:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE If that's ok. 

00:57:10
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:57:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Because you she engaged in what we call, uhm, An Externalising Conversation. 

00:57:15
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:57:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE So. Uhm, to kind of enter into that first. Could you just speak briefly about what, uhm, Externalizing is and then I will follow of slower commentary. Ok. 

00:57:25
JOHN WINSLADE Ok. Well it's a particular development of Narrative counseling practice uhm, uhm, uhm, I was, uhm, It's heritage to Michael Wordsworth (ph.) especially I think and also David Thexton (ph.) 

00:57:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm. Yes. 

00:57:40
JOHN WINSLADE uhm, it's about not treating problem issues as if they reside inside people and more treating them as external, putting them out into the kind of context of the world in which people live. 

00:57:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm. 

00:58:00
JOHN WINSLADE So that we can explore, you know, how we relate to them. 

00:58:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Ok, uhm, as everyperson who is watching this tape, uhm, what kinds of things would they might have noticed that, you said to Donna that distiguishes it, that , uh, that's an externalized piece? 

00:58:15
JOHN WINSLADE We talked a number of times about the habit. 

00:58:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yes. 

00:58:20
JOHN WINSLADE Not about Donna's habit, not about Donna having a habit, not about Donna being the habit, 

00:58:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Ok. 

00:58:25
JOHN WINSLADE But about that habit having her, or affecting her or shaping her or influencing her or persuading her. 

00:58:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Ok. So where the places where you separatd her from the problem. 

00:58:35
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Gramatically. 

00:58:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Gramatically. Yes. 

00:58:40
JOHN WINSLADE And, uhm, the aim, I think for an Externalizing Conversation is that the Gramatical separation of, uhm, versus an internalizing object that people are, are, uhm, experienceing , where they have started to feel that there is something wrong then. 

00:58:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Sure. 

00:58:50
JOHN WINSLADE Rather than thinking that there is something wrong with the habit. 

00:58:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Sure. So, one of the places where, uhm, as I was watching as you speak to her I noticed that, you were exploring some of those things, is that you are exploring about the, uhm, the length the problem had been around in her life. 

00:59:10
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

00:59:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE And in different places in which the problem exerted it's influence on her. 

00:59:15
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm. 

00:59:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Uhm. And I assume that was intentional from your part. 

00:59:20
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. I, I had a check list in my head, the words length, breadth and depth. 

00:59:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:59:25
JOHN WINSLADE And, and exploring the dimensions of the problem and it's effects in peoples life. 

00:59:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

00:59:30
JOHN WINSLADE Even in the Externalizing Conversation the lenght means the history of it. 

00:59:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:59:35
JOHN WINSLADE It's movement throught time. 

00:59:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Sure. 

00:59:35
JOHN WINSLADE Breadth meaning, the, the domains of life that it, that it effects. 

00:59:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:59:40
JOHN WINSLADE Work, home, family, friends, uhm, selfconcept, you know, it affects the mood of oneself and things like that. 

00:59:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm.Hmm.Hmm. 

00:59:50
JOHN WINSLADE And also depth meaning kind of the extent of the, uh, impact that it has, the, the, the pain that it causes, the effects that it has. 

01:00:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. Right. 

01:00:05
JOHN WINSLADE That is a check list that I use in my head. 

01:00:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. Yeah. And, uhm, it seem like there are many places when you were speaking there that you touched on some of that. 

01:00:15
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

01:00:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Uhm, but it also seem that, you know, these are kind of sniffers of conversations. 

01:00:20
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

01:00:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE And that you just got started with some things, you know, you talked her about the different domains... 

01:00:25
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

01:00:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE ...uhm, that have been around and, places in, ih her work life and someone in her family life aswell. 

01:00:30
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

01:00:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Uhm, and there are other places where you might want to, to take in the conversation had you had another thirty minutes with her. 

01:00:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Well, I mean, we could have gone a lot further and this wasn't Brief Conversation and... 

01:00:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

01:00:45
JOHN WINSLADE ...just an illustration. 

01:00:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

01:00:50
JOHN WINSLADE So, we could have lot further in exploring some of the effects. 

01:00:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Ok. 

01:00:50
JOHN WINSLADE Particularly the effects on, uhm, we, we did a lot of work effects, but, but could have explored lot about the family and friends... 

01:01:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

01:01:00
JOHN WINSLADE ...and those domains. 

01:01:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

01:01:00
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, uhm, we could have also explored, you know, little more depths on the effects on Donna interms of, uhm, how she thinks of herself. 

01:01:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yes. 

01:01:10
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, and whether, the kind of getting annoyed with herself was helpful or not helpful. 

01:01:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm. 

01:01:15
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, whether there is something she wanted to do more of or less of. 

01:01:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

01:01:25
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, so, there are a number of avenues like that, that we could have gone down but I was also, as the conversation went on wanting to explore the countless stories aswe. 

01:01:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm. 

01:01:35
JOHN WINSLADE And, we only had, a very brief touching on that kind of story. 

01:01:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. Yeah.Yeah. 

01:01:40
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm. 

01:01:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, I noticed that and again it was just sniffer of a conversation that, that we didn't get, get to develop that counter story. 

01:01:45
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

01:01:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Uhm, and it's full, can you give a couple of examples of questions that we might wanted to have asked on, that could potentially bring forward the counter story. 

01:01:55
JOHN WINSLADE Well, I was, I would have wanted to if we had more time to explore more and more detail the conversation that Donna was having with herself. 

01:02:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

01:02:10
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, especially about what she would prefer to be doing. 

01:02:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm. 

01:02:15
JOHN WINSLADE And to open up, uhm, a bigger and more detailed account of that. 

01:02:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

01:02:20
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, to explore more firmness and richness, uhm, and to notice the, the, the future possibilities that, that had sorrowfull possibilities aswell. 

01:02:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Alright. Alright. 

01:02:35
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, and if you like the length, breadth and depth of that. 

01:02:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. Hmm. When you were, I was curious about listening, to Donna was, uhm, there were places where, uhm, I hear the story of contrast. 

01:02:55
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

01:02:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Uhm, and that, that was tied up in identity story, and would have been interested in what the counter stories there. 

01:03:00
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

01:03:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE So for example. 

01:03:00
JOHN WINSLADE So, what would you have asked? 

01:03:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Uhm, I, I was thinking about asking, she was talking about how everybody in her family her family was really punctual. 

01:03:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. Yes. 

01:03:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Uhm, and that eventhough she might have been only few minutes late, uhm, that... 

01:03:15
JOHN WINSLADE It was noticable even if she was few minutes late. 

01:03:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE It was noticable if she was few minutes late and that same distinction then came up when she was speaking about, uhm, her work. 

01:03:20
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

01:03:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE That she don't wanted to be seen as irresponsible or unreliable. 

01:03:25
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

01:03:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Uhm, as I was hearing, I went to hear a little bit about this identical stories more and again had you had more time would have explored... 

01:03:30
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. Hmm. 

01:03:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE ...those what are those counter stories, you know, uhm, uhm, where she infact, uhm, where she infact, uhm, exhibit responsible behaviour, where people know who her is, uhm, uhm, kind of intelligent and moral... 

01:03:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. Yes. 

01:03:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE ...person. And I was curious about exploring some of those exceptions. 

01:03:50
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. Not only the area of tardiness that responsibility lies but their might be other aspects of, uhm, her, her work, and her committment to her family. 

01:03:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

01:03:55
JOHN WINSLADE And things like that, that might exhibit that kind of responsibility. 

01:03:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

01:03:55
JOHN WINSLADE Like responsibility was like a title for a counter story in a way. 

01:04:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. Right. That's why I was thinking about where might I have taken again, you know, it's not kind of wrong. 

01:04:15
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. Hmm. 

01:04:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE But I was just thinking about the other places I was like with, curiosity. 

01:04:15
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

01:04:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Than just the story of responsiblity. 

01:04:20
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

01:04:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE That I was, I was double listening, you know. 

01:04:20
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

01:04:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Boring in hearing. 

01:04:25
JOHN WINSLADE And this sort of conscious of how any problem exist within a social context. 

01:04:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

01:04:30
JOHN WINSLADE Which is one the reasons for Externalizing. 

01:04:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. Right. 

01:04:30
JOHN WINSLADE And placing that back into social context. 

01:04:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

01:04:35
JOHN WINSLADE So, what you are reminding me of was that, what Donna had said about, uhm, being punctual rather than family story. 

01:04:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

01:04:45
JOHN WINSLADE And made to stand out for her. 

01:04:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

01:04:45
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, uhm, perhaps we could have more explored in terms of what it meant interms of her relationship with her family. 

01:04:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. Right. Right. 

01:04:55
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, and there is a whole domain of both exploring the problem story and the counter story in that domain, if you like. 

01:05:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. Right. If it was a relational domain. 

01:05:05
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

01:05:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Absolutely. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Because that again could potentially shift that and so, uhm, the Externalization can be used to open those identity stories. 

01:05:15
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm. 

01:05:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. hmm-hmm. In a social domain in connection with her... 

01:05:20
JOHN WINSLADE Right, and that sort of conscious in that respect of how when we were talking about the story of, uhm, uhm, being responsible. 

01:05:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

01:05:25
JOHN WINSLADE That we were talking about that mainly interms of Donna's relationship with herself but... 

01:05:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. 

01:05:30
JOHN WINSLADE ...there may have been other people who had a different story of her, uhm, uhm, that could be or, or have responses to her story of responsibility. 

01:05:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

01:05:40
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm. which is an interesting response to responsibility. 

01:05:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Uhm. Uhm. 

01:05:45
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, that could have been woven into a different account as well. 

01:05:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm. Right. You would have been talking for hours with her. 

01:05:55
JOHN WINSLADE There is alot of, you know, you know, a lot possbilities in any conversation I guess. 

01:06:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE (laughs) Isn't it. Yeah. Ok. Alright. So, that's an introduction to Externalizing. 

01:06:05
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-Hmm. 

01:06:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE And to counter stories. Alright. 

01:06:05
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm-hmm. 

01:06:05
