00:01:40
JENNIFER GILLION Sarah’s Mother My name is Jennifer and I have two kids Sarah who is seven and Kira who is four. With Sarah um... I guess I knew something just wasn’t right. About three months old, she wouldn’t sleep she wouldn’t nap things where just so confusing. There were things going on at school when she was in JK and SK and I decided like enough was enough, I needed to find out what was bothering her. So we went to sick(ph) childrens and saw someone there and she did diagnosed her with ADHD with the hyperactivity inattentive type.

00:02:50
KAREN O’DONNEL Kail 

00:02:55
KAIL Um... my name is Kail I am 12 years old like to play the computer and I like to cut out with my cats and play with my, my puppy I'm… God... 

00:03:15
KAREN O’DONNEL Kail’s Mother I believe that Kail’s ADHD is not in extreme case in any way how it manifests in him is mostly through his social abilities. He will be the first to tell you that, if he is done something like task something or wacked me or whatever. He doesn’t know he is going to it before he does it. Or things like um... maybe where another person would think about what they're going say before they say it. And say well... you know this might be true but maybe it's not a good time for me to say this or whatever and sort of self at it, he can’t. 

00:04:00

00:04:15
ROGER The news that I want to with Daniel was incredible and he was (inaudible ) with one pediatrician and every pediatricians and me too. A specialist and another specialist (inaudible ) there are special to re-finally it's to my persistence that I finally got Daniel the proper diagnosis. I see the ADHD component in... in Daniel is attention sometimes. He is very scattered and how many times I say to him Daniel you are scattered... 

00:04:45
ROGER AND DANIEL DESJARDINS 

00:04:45
DANIEL DESJARDINS And I had to believe it... 

00:04:45
ROGER ...got all over the place because he, he has a hard time to focus on one thing, but the same time he could be on one thing but he wants whatever everything else is going on around him. 

00:04:55
DANIEL DESJARDINS And he... 

00:04:55
ROGER And he can’t focus, he can’t focus on that one thing. That's the attention part the hyperness comes into they intertwined with each other. The... I find when he on falls himself at the end of the day. He gets quite hyper. I mean, you know how many times I keep saying him, Daniel relax take it easy step back just breath deep take it easy and I… go to him Daniel slow down, slow down. Because he is, he is all over the place, he can’t control it. 

00:05:30
SARAH I don’t think (inaudible ) this one… 

00:05:40
JENNIFER GILLION Eat… 

00:05:40
SARAH Dad, daddy who was all (inaudible ) who wants small this… 

00:05:45
JENNIFER GILLION So want to have lunch hour with her, because she is not eating for me. 

00:05:55
FRED MENKA She is not eating for you? 

00:05:55
JENNIFER GILLION Not eating 

00:05:55
FRED MENKA I'll just… I will just get her off. 

00:06:00
JENNIFER GILLION Just do it right now. 

00:06:00
FRED MENKA Sarah’s Father Yeah, I am Sarah’s father and Jennifer’s husband. I am an educational assistant at, at high school, I basically help children with special needs. I’ve actually learned that I don’t know a lot from dealing with Sarah. It's something that’s so large and so different with each individual. That um... I you know I, I did, I had learned a lot of things about myself and about my work from having Sarah. As she has got a really tremendously strong will so she wants something she is gonna argue about it, it should go in different angles try and make it to what she wants. 

00:06:55
SARAH Mommy this Sunday I want you to fix that… 

00:06:55
JENNIFER GILLION Well, you know what I really want you to sit down and eat Sarah. 

00:07:00
FRED MENKA For me it's the volume of it, it just goes on all day and like she doesn’t wind down. 

00:07:15
ROGER Just recently ah... I decided after 30 years a bit of health problems, I decided to take early retirement. I still able to socialize ah... not as much I used to because obviously being a single parent right now it tells me to be with Daniel a lot and plus little sectors that I have. I have to worry about that, but ah... I have a little handful of things, I have to take care of so my time is not, is not just sitting around and wondering totally my times and wondering what I am going to do next. 

00:07:55
DANIEL DESJARDINS I remember back in 96th, March 11th that was one of the worst days in my life. Because my mom died that day. I, I remember like it was yesterday, um… I woke up and I think ma-ma was in her room right and so and so then she got up and she went to the washroom. And I was (inaudible ) then like I heard a thunder break and like she, she is like fell down the ground. And like she wasn’t answering for sometime but she was still awake and she was like moving her leg, she lost control of her bladder. And like, like I said "Mom what's wrong, what's wrong." And to that she said, she said and she was like, like a, like a shocked state and so I said, "I'm gonna call 911." And so they came took her away and that was the last time I saw her, I never got to see her again never got to say good bye. 

00:08:45
KAIL I don’t have lot of friends. And yeah they my friends come over to play at my house, but they usually don’t invite me over it I kept for other one, I go down the street. Don’t know why they don’t invite me. I think it may have some indirect ADHD maybe, because they don’t want me in their house being like hyper or something. 

00:09:15
KAREN O’DONNEL He just, he doesn’t need a lot of sleep and he just goes and goes and goes he is, he’s just a you know like he's, he is got a fully charged battery all the time. And um.. so those things really prompted me to start looking into all these natural things to happen to in child development. Finally, at the age of seven ah... he was diagnosed at the Scarborough hospital by Dr. Turgay with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. 

00:09:50
DR. ATILLA TURGAY M.D. F.R.C.P.C. Director, ADHD Clinic And Training Institute, The Community Hospital Childhood is, for most kids fortunately its full of life overly active stage they acted up thinking they don’t want to focus on one area, they jump from things to things. And almost every kid has somewhat Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder as part of growing up. How do we differentiate them from severe cases that we call Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder. First of all it’s a degree of severity so once a child who is hyper, restless, high in energy, impulsive, inattentive with difficulties in learning that three represents a chronicle syndrome for us. 

00:10:35
KAREN O’DONNELL My first reaction when I got the diagnosis for him I was relief. Um... because I found an answer to what was going on, but that was before I really knew what it all meant. I looked for all of the answers for him in many different ways. I've been through medication, I’ve tried neural feedback and um... I have looked into sort of the holistic approach as well, I find all of them to have their advantages and disadvantages. My particular belief is that ah...there is not one thing that works its many different strategies that have to come together. I just feel that it’s my responsibility to keep on looking, to keep on searching eve... and always to be on top of the newest information to, to help him and to give him the tools that he needs to be able to grow into a very creative and successful and, and loving and lovable adult. 

00:11:50
SARAH But I wanted, what I'm first... 

00:11:55
JENNIFER GILLION For Christmas we went to Ottawa to um... visit my cousin. The thing that really distressed me a lot though was that um... because her social skills or she doesn’t understand social cues or um... she needs to be taught how to play with the other kids. And the other kids just couldn’t understand her, so lot of times they just walked away and she was left by herself. And she just couldn’t understand that and the reason why is because everything was hers that was her club, her rules. And I was trying to teach her and trying to explain to her that there has to be just give and take. 

00:12:35
[sil.] 

00:12:40
JENNIFER GILLION Finding a way to channel all this energy and in all her guess and where I'm stuck up right now. And I get really tired of having to explain away Sarah’s behaviors um... I just wish people could accept Sarah the way that she is. 

00:13:00
We're going off the internet. As in of the internet, all the way of the internet. Now Daniel 

00:13:05
ROGER Do the teachers at school Daniel understand what you have? 

00:13:10
DANIEL DESJARDINS What most of them do some of them are little bit strict but like a few of them are very good to me and, and a lot… I have more, I think I have more friends and they look difference. 

00:13:20
ROGER Why is that? 

00:13:25
DANIEL DESJARDINS I don’t know because the teachers (inaudible ) I'm more mature and I'm more understandable. And some of the most of the kids you know they are not always say aware of the things they might be doing. And that, that, that in my short age you know just like me. 

00:13:35
ROGER Have you ever tried to explain that the kids what you have? 

00:13:40
DANIEL DESJARDINS Yeah, yeah sometimes I think they easily accept that. 

00:13:40
ROGER They accept that? 

00:13:40
DANIEL DESJARDINS I don't... some says a lot of kids call me... (inaudible ) and that is… it hurts me. 

00:13:50
ROGER Oh, I got imagine so. 

00:13:50
DANIEL DESJARDINS Because I am far from… which I'm smarter than most of them. 

00:13:55
ROGER You… Daniel you could, you probably could be smarter than most of them, but then on the other hand... what you got and do is try to explain them, and make them see and understand what you're all about. 

00:14:05
DANIEL DESJARDINS Hmm…hmm… 

00:14:05
Hi, how are you? 

00:14:10
Yes, that are relationships between ADHD and other psychiatric disorders. One in two threat disorder patients had a passion of hyperactive disorder. 

00:14:25
Who could remember at what time the agricultural(ph) reforms system is typically would start, the timing... 

00:14:30
About 2pm. 

00:14:30
Another 2'o clock in the afternoon right greater science… 

00:14:35
ROGER The relationship are between ADHD and (inaudible ) it's almost like it fits together. 

00:14:40
DANIEL DESJARDINS (inaudible ) threats is really bad see threats is, is actually because, caused by imbalance chemicals in your brain. And it causes you to twist like you know voluntary of vocal things you know with your mouth you know, you know stuff like that. And some, some, some try to even bark you know whoof, whoof. But don't, I don’t really do that thank god because when you are in public you know like in a restaurant whoo, whoof, whoof everybody will look at you right I think you will, oh god you know and it also this monothics(ph) which I'm more of than vocal you know. 

00:15:15
University of North California 

00:15:15
KAREN O’DONNEL I have been reading and hearing and off a lot about ah... Dr. Levine and his theories of Attention Deficit Disorder. And I, I love the way he thinks, I feel that ah...kids shouldn't be labeled, I wanted Kail to meet him. I wanted him to hear from someone who is as wise as this man is to know that ah… we're on the right track. 

00:15:45
DR. MEL LEVIN Founder, All Kinds of Minds Institute I think the research we were doing is extremely important ah... because I think it has the potential to prevent so many tragedies that occur in our society of kids who could have been successful and ratified in life and instead get into serious trouble. Or lose their ambition and never reach the heights of accomplishment and productivity of life that they could have done. So I think we're in a position to save a lot of suffering and a lot of ways simply by understanding kids who are really the innocent victims of the way they happened to be in life. 

00:16:25
[sil.] 

00:16:30
JENNIFER GILLION The medication issue is a really difficult one. We went to the natural pathway for about a month first of all we can't afford it to go get um... organic foods and, and, and Sarah will not drink the milk. So we passed on that we did try medication at the end of senior kinder garden. Um... more, more self-abusive when biting her hand and hitting her head. It was almost as if the medication suppressed all that anxiety and after whereof it came up double. So we took her off the medication, but I am very reluctant even try where to let her again. But I guess I, I am constantly searching for answers, I'm constantly reading, I am constantly talking to people, because I want the answers or some strategies to help her. 

00:17:30
[sil.] 

00:17:35
DR. MEL LEVIN We live at a sanctuary formed(ph) here in North Carolina and ah... at the reason these for 30 years now. So we now have 240 geese, so we have 35 different varieties of geese including some endangered species. I’ve over the years got very interested in how children learn, that how different children learn differently. It’s not their fault, it's not the parents fault, it's not necessarily the teachers fault, but children who just are having difficulty succeeding in life particularly of course in the school. Ah... and I’ve been fascinated by these kids by their strengths. My help desperately we need to redeem them, so they don't end up on drugs or in jail or chronically depressed. So they don’t know where their aspirations in life and write themselves of. And I think sometimes schools overlook the needs of these children, so that’s been a passion of mine over the years in sort of rescue fantasy to help, to help more and more children taste what success take is like. And we approach that I and my college uses, one way we don’t label children, there is no ADHD, no ADD, no LD, no Ds and all, instead we just try to describe their strength and weaknesses and their issues as well as we can. What phenomena is this kid dealing with its making life hard. There are so many things that a teacher can do in the class room. To manage more effectively the differences of learning the kids have, for example teachers if they know a child has trouble expressing himself. Then when you call on a class you have 3 seconds to respond. And if you got language ability to not all that strong kid formulate (inaudible ) fast. If a teacher knows that about a student she can go up to him and say Michael I am gonna call on you tomorrow to talk about the causes of World War II can be ready for that? In which case he has 23 hours instead of 3 seconds to formulate a response, it doesn’t cost any money that you make... and you see the ones with the stripes in their head. They are from India, therefore Indian bar headed geese. One of the same kind of observations and making children I see in the geese particularly socially how they interact with each other how much pride they have, how they have to display and market themselves to each other. 

00:20:00
I like their femur(ph)… 

00:20:00
DR. MEL LEVIN Yes. 

00:20:00
…we're sticking up for the (inaudible ) 

00:20:05
DR.MEL LEVIN That’s right, the misunderstood minds. 

00:20:05
That’s right… 

00:20:05
DR.MEL LEVIN They're wonderful, no two geese has the same kind of mind I think. 

00:20:15
KAREN O’DONNEL Kail was extremely happy when we were there and he was very comfortable. And um... I think he took away some knowledge that he as he is different but there... he doesn’t have a disorder, he there isn’t anything wrong with him, there is something different about him and that he needs to be able to learn how to work with his strengths. 

00:20:40
[sil.] 

00:20:45
DANIEL DESJARDINS (inaudible ) which may causing that's an, I'm it can kill us... 

00:20:50
ROGER Relax, take it easy. 

00:20:50
DANIEL DESJARDINS So you know we get this (inaudible ) oh yeah that require it requires they need to call the parents of the kid and tells them what they did. 

00:21:00
ROGER Okay, now about this you missing, missing these classes that... 

00:21:05
DANIEL DESJARDINS I know what I am (inaudible ). 

00:21:06
ROGER Well, Daniel and that for example on the history 10 course you miss, 10. 

00:21:10
DANIEL DESJARDINS Well, probably because I was late... 

00:21:10
ROGER …for the 22, where were you? 

00:21:15
DANIEL DESJARDINS I don’t know, I am not skipping... 

00:21:15
ROGER Then why it, why it... 

00:21:15
DANIEL DESJARDINS I don’t know. 

00:21:20
ROGER There is something wrong somewhere. 

00:21:20
DANIEL DESJARDINS You hadn't told me about it. 

00:21:25
MIKE COLELLA Daniel’s former principle When I reviewed the file and this is going back a few years, but he had turrets(ph) he was a ADHD and I think there was oppositional defiant disorder. And also some, some behavioral concerns so he had all of those. Um... I also visited Daniel at, at home I remember because I wanted to kind of ah... meet him so that I would know what his needs where. And that time I also realized that he was pretty bright young man, you know you could tell that he had some attentional deficit concerns, but then he was sitting at a computer and he could read well beyond the great level that he was up. 

00:22:00
KAIL Mommy I forgot my French dictionary. 

00:22:00
KAREN O'DONNEL Okay, and you forgot your pill just a sec. 

00:22:00
KAIL Okay. 

00:22:05
KAREN O’ DONNEL It took me a, a year to think about it, but then I finally did put him on medication and I put him on middle in and the result for him was evident in one day. So I really didn’t, you know worry about my decision at that time, but now he is, you know he's growing. And I don’t want him to be on medication. Um... all of his life I don’t think he needs to be, first and foremost time I tried to teach him what is going on with him, so that he can be knowledgeable so that he can advocate for himself one day. 

00:22:45
KAIL But it's just that time, you know my teacher said that um... that it would be of tomorrow, but one of the girl in my class raised it and then I never got to write, I never got to a.. 

00:22:55
KAREN O’DONNEL But if someone who raised it why didn’t you asked for help to write it down. We are having terrible trouble at school very, very significant problems at school which are creating more problems for him and his self-esteem. In the Kail’s grade 7 year half way through the year by that point in time he had been suspended twice. And was also following way behind in his school work so I went to the school and I asked them to do special testing. And I was denied that, the school really didn’t have the funds to do the testing right away. I finally sort out a educational advocate um... they help fight for him so the bottom line was I said forget it I don’t, I'm not going to wait, I'll do it privately. And the results came back that he’s actually at that time in grade 7 but operating on a grade 12 and fourth year university level. So I am looking at an extremely gifted child who is potentially failing. 

00:24:00
ROGER Daniel you never gonna pass history? 

00:24:05
DANIEL DESJARDINS I could. 

00:24:05
ROGER Daniel you're not I don’t think so, Daniel you have lot of work to do buddy you have an awful, awful, awful lot of work to do, you miss seven in religion. 

00:24:15
DANIEL DESJARDINS Because I kicked out of the class so many times. 

00:24:20
ROGER Why? 

00:24:20
DANIEL DESJARDINS Because all the kids bothered me and also misbehaving I lost that paper. 

00:24:25
ROGER But who’s winning on this year? 

00:24:25
DANIEL DESJARDINS I don’t know, not me. 

00:24:30
ROGER If he has to do two years next year I don’t know how I'm going to get, how am I gonna get to it. I have just have a it just seems that in the past month or so I guess or maybe two months, I just can't get through to him. 

00:24:45
TRACEY PARISH Daniel's current principal Daniel is an extremely talented young man I think he has got a great confident level with adults, I think he spent a lot of time with them, he said very articulate. But I think that he gets himself inappropriate relationship with students. And some students ah… take advantage of you know try and encourage him to do things. On a bad day Daniel has come in here and just been so mad, turned over my chair and went under my table. 

00:25:10
[sil.] 

00:25:20
JENNIFER GILLION I feel some guilty about, about seeing this, because I love Sarah with all my heart. To go out for lunch with Sarah is almost an impossibility. Because um... I've been out for lunch and just Sarah and I wanting that mother daughter connection and to have fun and to sit down and to talk and you just can't do it at a restaurant. 

00:25:40
SARAH I want that. 

00:25:40
JENNIFER GILLION No more ketchup, no. And you will get the ketchup for her, no more ketchup. 

00:25:45
FRED MENKA Sarah. 

00:25:50
JENNIFER GILLION With Kail on the other hand, it's easier to engage, um... so they are, they're very different and Kail is getting at the point where she gets flustered with Sarah because she wants to play with Sarah, she loves Sarah. But she's getting very defensive about how intrusive Sarah is. But I, I'm at a loss. 

00:26:15
SARAH No, no... stay away. 

00:26:20
FRED MENKA You can sit on my lap when we get home, okay I promise you we'll cut all and do all the stuff, but right now you got to sit in the chair. 

00:26:30
SARAH No, no... no no, no, no, no... 

00:26:45
[sil.] 

00:27:05
KAIL Some teacher's treat me going at school like um... a (inaudible ) teacher but some others don't really not, they don't really treat me as equal as everybody else, I don't know why like that. If I do something to somebody, I guess an accident or something they shall get me in a lot of trouble. Like the principal will get me in lot of trouble, but, but like if they do the, the same thing to me then they don't even get any, in any trouble. In my overall marks were probably around like 82, 83. 

00:27:45
[sil.] 

00:27:50
Shana can you bring Kail up first place. 

00:27:55
KAIL I feel a lot more comfortable I think it's in the scouts than I do with some of them at school. 

00:28:05
I promise that I will do my best. 

00:28:05
KAIL I promise that I will do my best. 

00:28:05
To do my great duty to. 

00:28:10
KAIL They treated like equal and like you just think of them as you think of yourself, but at school you try to be nice to somebody and then just, they're not nice to you. 

00:28:20
[sil.] 

00:28:30
FRED MENKA There isn't much time between Jennifer and I, you know we're like... a lot of the time you know, it's like we're passing each other by and, um... and I'm not feel badly about it and you know and um... so anyways that's basically it. 

00:28:55
[sil.] 

00:29:00
KAREN O'DONNELL Now...tell me. 

00:29:00
KAIL Why? 

00:29:00
KAREN O'DONNELL Is it true? 

00:29:05
KAIL Yes. 

00:29:05
KAREN O'DONNELL It's true. 

00:29:05
KAIL Yes. 

00:29:05
KAREN O'DONNELL Tell me exactly what it is. 

00:29:10
[sil.] 

00:29:15
KAREN O'DONNELL What? What's that? 

00:29:20
KAIL Read it. 

00:29:20
KAREN O'DONNELL What does that say? 

00:29:20
KAIL Fuck you. 

00:29:25
KAREN O'DONNELL Where did you find that? 

00:29:25
KAIL In my desk. 

00:29:30
KAREN O'DONNELL In your desk? Are you having problems with the kids at school? I don't why he get's set up that way, I know that the school doesn't help it at all. Um... I've talked to the principal so much about the fact that he's, he's really got problem in a social way. 

00:29:55
[sil.] 

00:30:05
ROGER This was a big shock to me yesterday to find that Daniel got suspended. 

00:30:15
DANIEL DESJARDINS I think I may be acting because I'm worried about my dad. 

00:30:20
ROGER I'm try not to put my personal problems on him, I had to go for a procedure yesterday, which I didn't even tell him about it because, I felt that it wasn't necessary for him to carry that burden to school with him. I'll go back on the 24th will see if its... if the procedure work, if not then I got a face the inner part of it is I mean my, my leg amputated, which is another, another stage in my life that I got to go through, what am I going to do with him, because its you know, it's easy to say that you are gonna get an amputation, but, the rehabilitation takes four months and they got to stay in a place for four months, what do I do with Daniel for four months. It's easy to blame everyone else… 

00:31:05
DANIEL DESJARDINS I always used to blame them. 

00:31:10
ROGER But Daniel you are always blaming someone else, but now the suspension it's not your fault, inside of your mind, it's not your fault it's the teacher's fault, it's everybody else's fault. They are suspending you because I'm not... they shouldn't do it, because of me… it's you son. It's what goes on... 

00:31:25
DANIEL DESJARDINS Well, I didn't think, if you look at the teachers, so the decision is (inaudible ) that office is the big mental world… 

00:31:30
ROGER Daniel, they, they, they have to do their job. 

00:31:30
DANIEL Well, it's not, it's, it's about (inaudible ) at them so it's not… 

00:31:36
ROGER It makes no difference Daniel. I'm fighting you know for myself, but I'm also fighting for him and it just seems yesterday that the whole wind was knocked out on me, because of the suspension. I never know, what is the ADHD or what is the rebellious part of it. You are mad in an instant, but the love is still there, then you sit back you think like you say well, they are not really in control of what is going on. Love is the most important thing, it's unconditional, and you either do, you don't there is no in between. 

00:32:15
KAREN O'DONNELL School is a dangerous place for him. Kail was discriminated against, I think he is labeled as a bad kid, he has a bad behavior problem, everybody wants everything to along smoothly, I know that teachers are up against the wall, because they have a lot a kids in the classroom they have been given more kids now, with different challenges and I think they are having a very difficult time with them. 

00:32:45
KAIL I got so stranded and I wouldn't, I am not able… I'm not like, um... first real team that I was on, like that in school, I got suspended, I couldn't go into the tournaments, the softball tournament and I went to (inaudible ) and cheered the team and watch the games anyways. 

00:33:10
KAREN O'DONNELL I did lose it when the police were called on Kail the situation, was taken totally out of context of what had had, what had happened, but however, he did do the wrong thing, but in the process, when I was informed about this by the principal, I had asked to be the… to be present. I'd didn't even know what was going on, and then I... when I arrived to the school, I found that the police officers were leaving, they had been there for 30 minutes, they were two police cars called for him for an incident that happened a week prior which again I wasn't even informed of, so I lost it and you I called the principal a bitch. 

00:33:55
FRED MENKA All the wonderful things Mr. Brown can do, he can go like a cow he can go moo… moo, but Mr. Brown can do it, how about you? You can go like cock, pa... pa... pa... pa... you can go like (inaudible ) clack... clack... clack... 

00:34:11
I got scared and I ran... I ran... I ran and knocked over, but (inaudible ) again, I get back what's wrong with that cow. 

00:34:20
FRED MENKA eek... kee... koo... hoo.. clack... clack... clack... dibble... dibble... dub... dub... cock-a-doodle-do... Mr. Brown can do it, how about you? Mr. Brown can whisper... whisper... very soft... very high... like the soft, soft whisper of a butterfly, may be you can do. I think you ought to try. 

00:34:45

00:35:05
DANIEL DESJARDINS I love you. 

00:35:05
ROGER Okay Daniel. Bye. Have a good day, good luck. 

00:35:05
DANIEL DESJARDINS I will. Bye. 

00:35:05
ROGER I'm right, no problems. 

00:35:05
DANIEL DESJARDINS No. Well, yesterday I turned 16, and this is (inaudible ) 16. I actually made it this far as all these years, kinda amazing, how I got this far. I cannot feel a big difference, I had from the way I used to. You know because, I used to get all that you know, you had to be more mature, and you can't... I can't if I am 16 though, I can't act like a 10-year-old. Ah... ah... ah... and whatever you know, the role in the (inaudible ) and you can't really do that. I just see my year turning no good, because this is the way I wanted to get turn out, passing everything and I was doing well and making everybody proud of me. So, I can learn computer, you know I was being able to like as I'm gonna put up my resume, you know I actually passed two years in high school well, doing well. I haven't got my average yet. My new average spike on up a bit. 

00:36:15
KAREN O’DONNEL Kail I... I'm sure will end up somewhere working with animals, because that he is just he has a very very special talent with them, and a very special bond. I had heard about this some, this man, who is one of Canada's three Horse Whisperers and when I heard about the work that he was doing with horses, that it was, it was incredible, because of the way in which he works with them. 

00:36:40
Pleasure Valley Ranch, Ontario 

00:36:45
CARY CONVERY Horse Whisperer This horse, his name is Toby, he is a registered Rocky Mountain Horse, he came me with lots of behavior problems or what were deemed to be behavior problems, he was a very scared horse, no one was interested in him. He was very afraid with any kinds of changes, he becomes very emotionally disturbed, so he needs someone who can, I guess be as slow as I am, and relax and teach him. 

00:37:20
[sil.] 

00:37:40
CARY CONVERY Thinking about humans, children who are ADHD, children who are different. ADHD children could feel like they are prey animals, and I think that possibly as another reason why when I watched children with special needs come to horses, even horses that are little bit nervous and so on it's like they understand each other. I have learned more from handling behavior problem horses that I ever did the ones that were solid, so that's been their gift to me. 

00:38:15
CARY CONVERY Kail, how would you like to come in and work with this horse and use your space and your energy and a big smile and ask this horse to follow you around as it's needed, would you like to do that? And learn how to talk to him in this way? Alright, come on. 

00:38:35
CARY CONVERY Push into his space, don't let him push into you, alright, come and walk in front of him and look right at his butt, and move his butt this side, that's the stuff, good, walk right around in a circle to the right... to the right very nice and see what he is doing. Good boy, his front feet, and he is a ajerthy(ph) okay, because you have a new bubble now your horse. 

00:39:05
JENNIFER GILLION It's very hard to have a relationship, I guess, even on the best of time, when you are raising kids, because there is always something going on and there is... I mean you are exhausted, but having a child who has ADHD, it's like having three or four kids by mould(ph) up into one. So by the end of the day, you are just like so exhausted, that there at least a very little time for a husband and wife relationship, because I think he works for special aide kids and he should have more of an understanding. 

00:39:40
SARAH I want to go now. 

00:39:40
JENNIFER GILLION We are going to go very soon. 

00:39:40
SARAH No. 

00:39:40
JENNIFER GILLION Very soon. 

00:39:40
SARAH Now. 

00:39:45
JENNIFER GILLION No, not now. 

00:39:45
JENNIFER GILLION I think that maybe he should have more of an understanding, where he comes home, and he says I deal with these behaviors all day long and then I have to come home and deal with them. And then I kept for... you know... 

00:39:55
SARAH I want to go now. 

00:40:00
JENNIFER GILLION I know you want to go now, I'm gonna to go in a minute. 

00:40:00
SARAH Now. 

00:40:00
JENNIFER GILLION In a minute. 

00:40:05
SARAH Now. 

00:40:05
JENNIFER GILLION So, he should have more of an understanding of what's going on, like we are on the verge, right now of separating. 

00:40:20
JENNIFER GILLION Although our landlord decided to sell the house. So, we were actually forced to move and were very fortunate to find this place with a backyard, and the neighborhood is pretty quiet and it's a lot nicer and a lot healthier environment. Now there, I think that we have decided Fred and I has to move schools, so we found a school, that's town near the heart of (inaudible ) and it's wonderful school, they has a lot of classrooms, they are totally for inclusion so they had kids of all different abilities in the class, they don't withdraw kids to the learning center, they are getting the learning center to the kids. They educate the kids about differences and how everyone is different, they are totally like for the different learning styles it relates the kids kept fit into a box and I think it's going to be wonderful Sara and Kira. 

00:41:20
ROGER Over here. 

00:41:25
[sil.] 

00:41:35
ROGER You failed three subjects. 

00:41:40
DANIEL Yeah, I know. 

00:41:40
ROGER Why didn't you listen to me, all you along or I have no problems… 

00:41:45
DANIEL I'm sorry. 

00:41:45
ROGER Denial want this, but you were always on the computer, you are ready to go play with your friends outside. Now look, look at the mess that you are in. You are going to go to summer school now. I told you today, he comes in... you (inaudible ) said well my computer needs to be upgraded, while I said, I said no, you said fuck you. 

00:42:01
DANIEL No I didn't. 

00:42:05
ROGER Yes, you did Daniel I go call Debby and Tom they were both here. When you don't get your way, you lash out at me like crazy, now this is not going to be easy, if the minute that you are gonna screw up they are going to kick you out. I am very, very, very hurting and disappointed. I am disappointed for you, you doesn't seem to bother you one bit, does it? Right Daniel. Answer me Daniel, being silence is not going to help. 

00:42:40
DANIEL Yes, it is. 

00:42:40
ROGER Why? 

00:42:40
DANIEL People keep saying, I don’t want to say. 

00:42:45
ROGER I don't know what to do anymore. I tried to give you the best I can, but it's not working, it's definitely not working. 

00:42:55
KAREN O’DONNEL Most of the time, I'm just sort of intellectually, sort of say don't worry about it. But I guess after many years of sort of dealing with, this and fighting with schools, um... you know I get more now. 

00:43:15
KAIL I don't want to change schools, because like feel kind of like that it's running away from my problems and I want to stand up to a principal and tell don't like(ph), I'm sure that like... I'm not... I'm not scared of her... I'm not gonna run away. I'm gonna beat it. I'm gonna graduate from the school, and I am gonna show her that I can do it. 

00:43:40
KAREN O’ DONNEL We went through the series of meetings throughout the school, the rest of the school year, and although we fought very hard and we did everything that we were supposed to do in the way that we're supposed to do it. Ah... literally, nothing happened in the entire year, and that's why I worry for him to go school next year, because I think at the slightest incident of anything that killed us. um... I worry about him, being the police being called and yeah it's... it's... it's not, I'm not looking forward the next year. 

00:44:20
[sil.] 

00:44:35
KAREN O’DONNEL How are you doing? 

00:44:35
DR. ATILLA TURGAY Fine, thank you. 

00:44:35
KAREN O’DONNEL Good. 

00:44:35
DR. ATILLA TURGAY Nice day. 

00:44:40
KAREN O’DONNEL Yeas. 

00:44:40
DR. ATILLA TURGAY Great. 

00:44:40
KAREN O’DONNEL Enjoying the weather. 

00:44:40
DR. ATILLA TURGAY Okay, how is he? 

00:44:45
KAREN O’DONNEL I have some really specific things to ask with regard to you know, is it possible to be for him that his age to may be, be growing out of ADHD and how would I find that out? 

00:45:00
DR. ATILLA TURGAY About 1 in 5 kids grow out of ADHD almost every year. About half may grow out of the major symptoms before they become an adult. You brought me some electro-physiological information, that I understand computerized electroencephalograph now shows more of alfa wave distribution during the week time, which is a very good sign, that shows more mature brain functioning, definitely he is doing much better in my view as a cognition(ph) I would say that there are signs that he is growing out of this. 

00:45:35
KAREN O’DONNEL It takes a period of time, before that label perse is removed from the child. I have started that process with Kail with the first meeting that I had today where I learned, that he has definitely moved away from the original symptoms, which I agree with because he is nowhere near the kid that he was when he was younger. The diagnosis will now take yet another period of time to, to find out where he is at in about 6 to 8 months from now. 

00:46:10
JENNIFER GILLION Well, Sarah it's not, it's not warm enough. 

00:46:15
[sil.] 

00:46:20
JENNIFER GILLION It's incredible what your environment can do. And like I can't believe that just a change in a house can make that big of a difference. But as far as like the ADHD, it's still there and it was not gonna disappear just because we have moved. 

00:46:35
[sil.] 

00:46:50
JENNIFER GILLION They are still that the power struggles and they are not focusing in the getting up and going to do something else and they are coming back and eating the breakfast, and then realize oh I has something else to do and they're also there. At the other place, I was so rushed to get out of the house, because I hated it so much. Now, the mornings I am more relaxed, I stay behind with Kira if I takes her to school, and I think that helps Sarah be more calmer too, because I'm calmer, and I am not so rushed in the mornings. 

00:47:25
[sil.] 

00:47:30
JENNIFER GILLION So she is beginning to realize that her brain thinks faster or differently than other people. She has got to her own way to learn and if it is standing up or going on the floor then that's the way it's gonna have to be. And this new school, I think, it's... it's going to be better, they are not as strict and as tight as, as the other schools. They, they want to adapt their program to how the kids learn, and that's only makes somewhat sense. 

00:48:05
[sil.] 

00:48:10
ROGER I had plans, I mean I didn't tell him I had plans, I can't go too too far, because of dialysis. What I was planning is may be they can assure a little trip up to visit my two sisters up in South Hampton to get him away with everything and all that now, unless... unless he surprises me and does really, really well in the summer school. 

00:48:40
[sil.] 

00:48:45
KAREN O'DONNEL I think what Kail and I anywhere trying to accomplish is to be able to say you know, look beyond the symptoms and see really, truly who I am inside. And I think in our day and age in our society, it's easier to say oh that, it doesn't exist or those kids are just using it as an excuse, then to say may be these guys are just operating on a different level, and maybe they just have to be we have to open up and... and we have to be able to change the way that we are dealing with them in order to be able to get the reaction back, that we need from them. 

00:49:25
[sil.] 

00:49:30
KAREN O'DONNELL I do believe that his ADHD has sort of compensated you know like one part of the brain may be working at a lower capacity, while he has another part of the brain that is working at a higher capacity, you know Kail is a very very intuitive individual and I, I believe that horses work on a very intuitive level as well, and they connected. And that connection is very solid and you know he continues to, to visit there and to, to work with that horse. 

00:50:05
CARY CONVERY I think, may be these children with ADHD or anyone with it is living in a now time, alright and is happening fast, so they need an opportunity to have the time to have all this fastness going on, or whatever it is, they have a movement in time to let it slow down. And... and that will happen, I believe anyway if they, if they're given the space and the time and the respect of the awareness of it. 

00:50:35
[sil.] 

00:50:55
Sarah and Kira are very happy in their new school. Jennifer and Fred remain together. Daniel passed one of two classes at summer school. Roger had part of his foot amputated and regained use of his leg. Kail has made new friends and still visits Toby. Karen continues to work with the school to implement his accommodations.
