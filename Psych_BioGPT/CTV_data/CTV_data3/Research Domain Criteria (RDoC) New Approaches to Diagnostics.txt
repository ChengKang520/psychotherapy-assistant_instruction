Research Domain Criteria (RDoC): New Approaches to Diagnostics 

00:00:25
ALLEN IVEY Welcome. I am Allen Ivey, and today, I would like to share what I see as a really important issue, really important issue for the future of counseling and psychotherapy. This is the NIMH research-based domain criteria, which is going to lead to new approaches in brain-based diagnostics. This will be ultimately replacing or changing the diagnostic and statistical manual in the way we relate to and plan our treatment for patients and our clients. What you are going to see is my adaptation and additional slides, on genes particularly, of original work by NIMH's Bruce Cuthbert. He is director of the Adult Translational Research, and he is at NIMH, and very important and the leader in terms of seeing that this new project, it's a 10-year project on brain-based diagnostics actually come to the fact. I can't say how important this is, and I really hope that you will start looking for news, information about this project and start looking at neuroscience and related issues. Neuroscience informs social justice. These research domain criteria, RDoC it's often called, RDoC ultimately has important social justice implications. What the NIMH says is that we are holistic people. We are disciplines of neuroscience, neurobiology, neurology, genetics, biology, chemistry, physics and psychology become important. And as you see how they have laid out the framework for this new diagnostic system, important that you are aware of many issues. But in each of these issues, whether it is family, community, the culture, or the environmental context, social justice impacts what's going to happen in the genes, what happens neurobiologically, what happens in genetics, what happens in biology, chemistry, physics and of course, psychology. Let's start philosophically with I think a wonderful statement from Robert Sapolsky, at Stanford, "Depression is the disease, as is diabetes." As therapists and counselors, we tend to focus on depression as something in the mind, which of course it is. And we know that CBT, Cognitive Behavior Therapy, in a good relationship we can have really a good impact on depression and it's action. The same time, there is a stressed synapse, emotions change body functioning. And notice the body is reacting, sleep disturbances, we eat more or less, stress hormones work and the biology, bio-clock is out of whack, rhythm repeats or distorts. So depression is a disease as diabetes. Schizophrenia is a disease as diabetes. Anxiety is a disease as is diabetes. Each one of our diagnostic categories has a body factor, and that is what's really important about this new RDoC brain-based approach, brain-body. And they start giving us the specifics, and our handouts that go with this, I hope you have the handouts. We certainly have supplied them, but I know handouts kind of get lost, so you may want to stop and look carefully at some of the slides here, because the text is going to get just a bit small. I apologize for that, but it is necessary. That's why I supplied handouts for this presentation. Important in all of this is severe stress and the need for social justice, action and awareness. Stress brings about negative neurogenesis. You don't generate new neurons. There is neuron loss, cortisol, you are losing neural connections. Fetal neural migration, the whole idea of stem cells moving to appropriate parts of vein because of alcohol or maternal depression, the neurons don't migrate appropriate. Interestingly, shockingly actually, in fact, to me is they have now found that if the father is depressed, through the semen, some aspects of the depression can be passed on to the infant, to the fetus. So, there is a whole connection of environment that's critical. So, this is where social justice issues become diabetes and heart disease are more often problems with the poor and oppressed, lack of growth goes with the stress. They are shorter, anxiety and depression go with the stress, and of course, acting out and violence go with stress. I will just say one story which in one sense is a bit extreme, but I think it illustrates what stress can do. Tony Crespi(ph), one of my very… I have had many super-star students and Tony is just one of them, at the University of Hartford now. Tony studied, looked at the 13 teenagers who were on death row. What he looked for was how many traumas they had gone through, serious, interpersonal traumas, and violence. He found that the average kid, child, teenager, on death row had experienced 13 traumas of violence. So, in effect, there is a whole issue of destruction that happens in the brain and body from severe stress, and violence of course is one of the worst types of… worst type of stress that you can encounter. Also, another example of social justice before we get to the actual work within NIMH, is just notice quickly here that high socio-economic status, middle socio-economic status and low socio-economic status, all start about the same point. But with enrichment, money and opportunity, these three babies at 37 months have very different total gray matter in the brain. So, is again the importance of social justice and looking at issues of income, opportunity and racism, all of the problems we have all too much in our society. What does the RDoC, the brain-based plan, the strategic plan and its goals? Classify disorders based on neurobiological measures and observable behavior. Classify disorders on neurobiological measures and observable behavior. Rather different than DSM, which focuses on… on observable behavior and inferred mental conditions from observable behavior. There is of course a strict pathological orientation. On the black you have Bruce Cuthbert's words on the mind, on the right you have mine, noticing there's very little positive you are going to find in RDoC. That is a problem in the model, and I will be referring to it frequently. Second goal is identify fundamental components that may span multiple disorders, executive function, affect regulation. Here we are working on the PFC, the limbic system. I want to identify what's going on in terms of the PFC, what's going on in limbic system. All of this now is measured with fMRIs and another measures. So, we are going to… these fMRIs, EEGs are going to become an increasingly important part of the assessment, and I think treatment, particularly, as you move to transmagnetic stimulation neural feedback. They are interested in normal… they have normal variations, we can't argue with that. But they… And this is really critical. One of the things I really like, maybe even love about the model, they integrate genetics, neurobiology, behavior, environment and experiential components. And I got to say, first of all, I have been anti-genetics pretty much throughout my life. And the idea of genetics determining… particularly that horrible research that's done around IQ is very offensive. And so I decided… but I saw increasingly in the neuroscience literary discussions that it's genetics. So, I looked up and bought Stoller's psychiatric genetics, and expecting to find things I disagreed with. He presented a very convincing argument that schizophrenia and other disorders do have genetic components. I all… The interesting thing, the chapter would be like two-thirds in schizophrenia, on the genetic component, but the last third would tend to be at… or given that how can we avoid the tipping point that takes a child or a teenager or an adult into schizophrenia or a serious disorders. Then it lays out issues, income inequality, social justice, a whole raft of issues in terms of we need to think about community, development and community building to provide a healthier environment for people. And this particular aspect is not really mentioned adequately in the RDoC. The genetics, uh… from an intelligent point of view, tends to have a lot of supporting stuff for work in social justice. And they want to develop a reliable and valid measures for using basic and clinical studies. But there is no significant attention to multicultural issues that rattles me, resilience, idea of you can get better, development is underplayed, very little… nothing much in positive resources. In that sense, in my perspective, RDoC is naive and I would like to see a change. But nonetheless, it's like DSM, which I disagree with. We need to know what it is, because what is is, what is what is. Now this is Bruce's… Bruce Cuthbert's statement, and I like this. It starts with neural development. Very… but on other hand, they start looking at the fine print, very little is done with neurodevelopment. But it does allow space for fetal development, and what happens to the child neurologically throughout the lifespan. And then we have an environmental orientation. Again, it's there in the framework, this is where I really fall in love with the RDoC framework. You start with development, development occurs in an environment, terrific. And here we have domains. That's why we say "research domains". First domain is negative valence, things that are really problematic with the client, and that's where we get into the limbic system in the… in the mid-brain, in the center of the core of the brain. What's going on in the amygdala, what's going on which might react negatively, but these are measurable in the limbic system. Positive valence, this comes in through… what's going on in the PFC where are the more positive emotions lie. I like that. Cognitive systems, that's very, very psychological and we certainly believe in cognitive system. But we are still working with the PFC, where we read notes in slide, and of course I am going to remind, and social systems come in as well. And notice that we have all of these physical systems and then the social system, behavior and history. Social systems can and could and should include much more in terms of cultural issues. Arousal and regulatory system, that's bringing under breathing, heart, uh… amygdala function(ph), response rates, really critical stuff. I like that a lot, because it really shows us we need to look at the body. There is also units of analysis, and it gets right down to cells, and I said cells. My gosh, what… what… what do I as a psychologist need to know about cells? So, I followed that up and now I am reading… every now and then, I read an article on cell biology, and I begin to see what happens in the environment, whether it's a social justice issue, or just… not just, or a trauma actually effects the developmental interaction within the cell. And this is now measurable. We can see changes in cells. We can all see changes in the circuits. This is where we are getting into the connect dome, and the whole issue of brain circuits. How does the amygdala connect with the PFC? What is the whole issue of… how do the nerves… how do the nerves connect and so forth. This is research, it's just starting now, and it's still far from actually providing any specific things that we can do, we were doing. Health, we are in favor of, but eventually, we are going to start to identify problematic dysfunctional brain circuits and start functioning… start aiming our treatment, both medical and psychologically, on specific brain circuits. Behavior, you are familiar with behavior. I will continue to read, it's still in there. And self-reports. Traditional stuff that we work with are kind of done here in the lower right hand of the quarter. But there is lots of other areas of domains and units that we don't do a lot with. So, recently scientific advances have revolutionized the power of genetics. Old view, biology, genetics and destiny. New view, biology is not destiny, genetic effects are not fixed. Genes are turned on and off. They mutate. Epigenetics… it can be much more common in our thinking. I like to think of "dancing genes", dancing genes that are constantly moving in relationship to what's going on in our body and in our environment. These dancing genes are inheritable and… and they can pass on. But basically, there is no change in basic DNA, although there may be, research may show later on that DNA may be permanently change. New information can be passed on generationally. So, genetics needs to become a more central part of our thinking and our work with clients. And genetic counseling, of course, becomes an important issue. The new scientific understanding of genetics and the dancing gene. Genes turn on and off by stress, drugs, hormones, environmental toxins, pollution, nutrition and exercise. This is where you can start thinking social justice, because the poor, those who are oppressed, tend to have much less opportunity to keep their genes, the positive genes. Turning… So, you can turn on genes positively with exercise and cognitive challenge, or they can be turned off by problems in those areas. Lifespan gene changes. Genetic mutations influence mental and physical health. They are common, and most are spontaneous rather than inherited, although the environment can lead to genetic changes. And epigenetic changes are heritable over generations. For example, I mentioned the stressed father and depression. The semen can pass depression on to the fetus, and fantastic… startling research says that what goes on between the… even before birth, very much effects the action of genes turning on or off. DNA and gene expression, this is greatly oversimplified, we go back to Watson and Crick in the UK, and DNA leads to RNA, leads to proteins. And this, believe it or not, DNA and translation to a specific types proteins now is becoming an issue we begin to need to understand. I am not going to go into this slide in any detail. That's one of the reasons I have started to pay much more attention to neurology and cell biology, because I see this very much as in our future. DNA impacts our gene expression. Greatly oversimplified here, something we are all going to have to understand as we move along in the field, very necessary part, certainly over the next 10 to 20 years. This is a study done at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, fear conditioning impact memory. Histones order DNA and regulate genes. What they found was that these histones stop or slow the memory of fear. These histones control the consolidation of recent and remote memory, the hippocampus and the cortex. And if they are epigenetically changed or removed, the fear memory lingers. It's a possible issue in dementia. Now this is a very small study. I just mentioned this one and the references down there below, to illustrate not too practical for us today, but there's going to be a raft of studies like this one coming that are going to show us what we need to think about in counseling and therapy, and our need to understand… develop a new language to deal with the body, DNA, histones, cytokines, mitochondria, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, lots to learn. We are going to be changing. We need to think body-brain, brain-body. Genes, mice and human resilience. Learning, change, brain plasticity, all require energy and stimulation. Their action… One this study, they located in the mouse a gene located for intelligence. Can you imagine they found the gene related to intelligence in the mouse? Well, they bred these mice until they had a lot of them, and they had them run through the mazes, and lo and behold these genes, these mice zipped through the genes incredibly fast, very, very skillfully. And then the dumb mice who had the ineffective gene, couldn't get through the mazes. They put these mice with the defective, dumb genes in a resilient environment. Lots of things they could do for exercise, gave them a better diet, better light, etcetera, and lo and behold, before too long, the so called dumb mice were zipping through the maze just as fast. What does this tell us? There is no excuse to give up on mice. They are resilient. What does that else say to us? There is no excuse to give up with people. And people literally make a generalization from this. If we provided a stimulated and social justice environment, we have resilient people if they have the opportunity to grow. This is a very central study we need to be aware of and what can be done. This particular issue is not stressed in the RDoC, and the thing is society and the wealthy perhaps don't want resilience. Let's keeps a group of people operating like dumb mice. Let's not give any opportunity to grow. The Gulf War illness is not in the veteran's head, but in their mitochondria. This is also called post-traumatic stress disorder. I refuse to use the word "disorder", because any veteran's been in Iraq or Afghanistan, or probably have to deal with ISIS now, is subject to depression, anxiety, fatigue, exercise and (inaudible ) cognitive difficulties, GI problem, sleep problems, etcetera. And their mitochondria power all of this very important issue. The ATP is damaged by this, and ATP is the energizing thing that make the muscles work, and makes the thinking work. We have all kinds of mitochondria in the brain that provide the energy for our thought and thinking. If you have a trauma over there, Gulf War illness, you are going to have some certain problems with that. And it's not in their heads, but in their body. It's in their body. Interestingly enough, the supplement Coenzyme CQ10, antioxidant, electron carrier, it hits the mitochondria electron transport change, is beneficial in the treatment of Gulf War illness. So in effect, we need to become much more aware of what's happening in the body. This isn't post-traumatic stress, it is definitely not a disorder. It's a logical response to insane environments. We need to be aware that there are ways to treatment that are medical as well as psychological. And by the way, anticipate epigenetic transmission to children of Gulf War illness. Figley found this a long time ago and has worked with families, trauma impacts and goes down through the generations. Now this is where you really need the handout, otherwise you are going to have to stop this slide and read it carefully. But negative valence system speaks to elevated stress reactivity. So, you are reacting especially to stress. If you're stressed, the next time there is stress, you tend to react more. And that's based on the limbic fear avoidance. So, we need to look at stress reactivity, and that's possible to measure that that leaves the problems in emotional regulation. And that's all based on limbic fear avoidance, that make the lap of PFC emotional regulation. The gut brain access. Remember the gut as more serotonin than the brain produces. Dopamine comes from about the same amount from the brain because as it does from the gut. So, we need to start looking at stress reactivity, and that's the negative valence. Acute threat, potential threat, sustained threat, loss, frustrated. So, we need to look at things that will happen with the client, but these are all measured in terms of what happens because of that in the genes, what happens in terms of molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior. So, you can see how we get the interaction between units of analysis and the domains. Positive valence system, it means lack of pleasure in usual activities, a lack of energy, PFC, a lack of dopamine, norepinephrine for activation, serotonin, lack of emotional regulation. So, positive really means speaking to the lack of pleasure, lack of energy. I always have trouble with the positive valence system. Still we are dealing with the problem. Cognitive system, we look at memory problems, problems of executive functions, PFC issues. And we move down to social withdrawal, poor relations, arousal systems. But notice genes, molecules, cells, circuits physiology and behavior. You look at each of these issues in relationship also to genes, molecules, cells, and eventually, we are getting very comprehensive and by the way, very complex diagnostic systems. Interesting way to think about this is a holistic approach. This is the simpler way to think about anxiety's affect on the stomach and digestive tract, the heart, the lungs, the brain, the immune system. That's basically is what the great strengths of RDoC, it tell… helps us look holistically at what's going on rather than just what's going on in the head. And DSM, the diagnostic statistical manual, tends to be focused on the head, failing to deal with all these other things that are happening simultaneously. And this is an example of how to use that same chart with anxiety, and this is where again… I would really recommend pausing of this particular slide and looking at the handout. And there you begin to see how the valence systems go across. This is one that's just for acute threat, and we see that all those genes, BDNF, CRF, these genes are now known to relate to what… how a person responds to acute threat. The molecules, you see specific molecules that respond to acute threat. We see the brain circuits. We see hippocampus, the amygdala, these various brain circuits that react, and we're going to get more and more precise with this, with President Obama's brain-based initiative, the physiology, what's going on with skin conductance, what's going on… So that's just with acute threat. Of course, the behavior and self-report stuff you are familiar with, we will leave it at that. And that's what happened in relationship to threat. And that's the anxiety matrix, and just one piece of the anxiety of matrix. What's going on in terms of cognitive attention. And we can measure attention in the brain, we can measure memory, etcetera. Let's look at the negative valence for anxiety just a little bit more in detail. With the genes, these are some examples I… I selected. In molecules, we have CRF, cortical releasing hormone, and the blue is of course Cuthbert, the red is me, I add that to give a little more clarity. Cortisol, which can damage the brain, which by the way can lead to suicide. Anxiety leads to less effective brain functioning and over time can be permanently damaged. Cells, we look particularly at the pituitary cells. We get into hormones and cortisol. Circuits, we want to go to the stria… stria terminals, that nucleus. The activity relates to the HPA again, the brain circuits, how the things move from place to place. Startle effect, average cortisol level and physiology. And then, of course, behavior self-report. And paradigms, I do like… they mentioned paradigms that has to do with context. But here they are just focus on contextual sort of darkness in humans, light in rodents. I think that's kind of a limited start to what are the various environmental impacts that are involved. I think we will see improvement later on. Depression examples, this one is one I developed, the… I was pretty interested in the genes, and I think it's a gross generalization, but it's believed that depression is 37% genetic. And so, my goodness, this individual or some people depression probably is totally environmental, other people, there are certain genetics that are going to take at a different place. But clear to all is that five HTTLR, and there's 14 variants of that serotonin transporter genes. So (inaudible ) responds better than anti-depressants, but different variations respond differently to different anti-depressants. So, genes are really critical, and one thing you want to… eventually we are going to find is well they are using genes for identifying cancer… treatments for cancer. We are going to start, at some point, looking at genes and what's the best treatment for depression. I find that almost shocking, hard to believe, but that is something we can anticipate coming. Particularly as they move to more serious issues, serious troubles, serious challenges such as schizophrenia, etcetera. In the molecules, depression, you will find that dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, cortisol, all impacted in depression. And these are measurable. Production of dopamine is measurable, production of serotonin, these are measures that will be available in the long run. Pituitary, very important to look at the pituitary, how it relates to anxiety and depression, immune cells, cytokines and mitochondria. This is mitochondria again. Circuits and depression are about the immune system, hyper-metabolism. Again, these are probably your handout, and I think it's useful to sit there and talk about, in smaller groups, what do you think about this idea of measuring these type of things as part of the treatment? And physiology, heightened cortisol, which results in slower thinking, movements, et cetera. And of course depression has familiar things such as withdrawal, crying, sadness, loss, inappropriate behavior, guilt, morbid thoughts, psychomotor retardation behavior. To summarize all of this, we are back to depression is a disease as is diabetes. Schizophrenia is a disease as diabetes. Posttraumatic stress, Gulf War illness, is a disease as is diabetes. All of these, and why do I say is disease, disease is anything impacts the body. It may be a logical reason for that disease, and that disease is often a logical response to an insane and often oppressive and traumatic environment. So called disorder, trauma, disease is often a logical, and defensive response by the way, to insane, traumatic, dangerous environment. So we've got to start thinking brain and body, and that's one of the things I treasure about this. But I am, as you know, quite concerned about the insufficient attention to environmental effects, oppression and social justice. For me, that third dimension is handled poorly. Not enough stuff on developmental, environmental effects. We need to think more about fetal development, child development. We are sure this is where we can do a lot of good, be acting the social justice and improve this. What's going to happen, what actually is happening, Tom Collins (ph.) who is director of NIH, when he announced the… his brain-based initiative, part of this was they stopped funding DSM research. They stopped funding DSM research, and they said they are only going to fund the research on what I have just been sharing with you. Needless to say, this created quite a hullabaloo. The next day, Tom Collins, head of NIH, came out and backed off saying, "Well, that isn't what I really meant." Well, we all know that the lobbyists got to the politicians, big pharma got to the politicians, and put big pressure on NIMH. NIMH, I think, would like to open more to environmental, et cetera, effects. But we are going to see big pharma, politicians sort of narrowing it down… and psychiatrists, think of the money that psychiatry gets from diagnostic and statistical manual. They will be there ensuring, monitoring the whole process. So this brain-based thing has marvelous possibilities, but I think it's going to be very much damaged and limited by what happens politically. So we are actually seeing a political issue happen here. There is a great need to look at what happens at adolescent brain development, so far not mentioned. We need to look at what happens in the social environment, what happens with fear and distress in teens, we need to look much more at changes in the average… age is not really given attention so far in the… in the issue, it's the developmental issue. I think we anticipate it will be in the future. Abuse and trauma, you don't get enough or if any attention. No discussions what's called the "default brain". I am not going to talk about the default brain, that's missing. We are getting into issues of the unconscious, which by the way are measurable. We have now got ways to measure activity in the unconscious. Insufficient or lack of attention in jurisdiction, and not surprising, no discussion of gender, no discussion of class, no discussion of poverty. So these are things that greatly trouble me about this fantastic model. And yet it's got some very practical stuff for us today, and I think you've got to prepare to deal with these issues. I hope we will be able to deal with them with a more social justice and environmentally oriented framework. So what can we do, this is a whole different issue. And this is where I am going to end the thing, is I am going to go study by Dean Ornish, lifestyle changes gene expression at the molecular level. In other words, Dean Ornish, well known for work in diet has found that a very low fat vegetarian diet with 10% of calories from fat, 180 minutes a week of moderate aerobic exercise, one hour of stress management each day, how many of you are going to do an hour of stress management, but look at the results there in red. Ornish profiled 22,000 genes, so we actually have of the NIMH RDoC here in operation, we profiled the genes, a 143 changed expression, improvement in cardiovascular risk, weight, hypertension and cholesterol. So I am talking about… this is ten years away. Dr. Ornish today is profiling genes. We are not very far away from profiling genetic changes in psychotherapy. We are not very far away for looking at how brain circuits work as a result of psychotherapy. We are not very far away from a raft of issues and how the body is impacted by various types of trauma. We're likely going to find that certain type of trauma induces this type of impact, therefore this type of therapy plus this type of medication, hopefully not so much medication, lots of medication if you are a big pharma. But we are going to start developing what I call "precision treatment" in the new way. So there's some very exciting things ahead, and to ignore these, I think is very much at our peril. Psychology and counseling have tended not to pay much attention to the body impact. Now I think they need to become a central issue, and that's a great strength of the NIMH, National Institute of Mental Health, brain-based initiative. I hope this has been somewhat interesting to you. It's what… It's our future, folks. Let's get at it. Thanks for listening.
