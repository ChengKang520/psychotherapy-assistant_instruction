MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development The 24th Annual Teachers College Winter Roundtable on Cultural Psychology and Education PRESENTS: Joseph G. Ponterotto, Ph.D. Fordham University, New York, NY Looking Beyond Race, Looking Beyond Borders: Explorations into the Multicultural Personality 

00:00:00
JOSEPH G. PONTEROTTO  Thank you, Sam. With, ah, thank you for that. Madonna, thank you. Thank you for all, all for coming. I'm pleased to deliver this lecture in honor of Janet E. Helms' groundbreaking contributions to World Psychology. Her vision, courage and scholarship made a solid foundation on which my generation of psychologists stepped upon to launch our own research programs and career pursuits. Let's take a look at today's title of the lecture, ah, overhead one, which, Rich, has up. So I'll be talking about, "Beyond Race, Beyond Borders", our new work on the multicultural personality. How does that topic sound to people? Sounds interesting? 

00:01:00
JOSEPH G. PONTEROTTO Okay. Before I gin, begin. I first like to dedicate this lecture to any students in the audience. May I put you on the spot and ask all the students in the audience at any level, high school, college, Ph.D., masters, to stand for a minute and stay standing, as I want to ask you something, so all the students please stand. St, ju, just stay standing for a minute. Well, quite a few. We wanna gaze upon the future of our field. I al, also asked you to remain standing coz I have a request for you. My generation of psychologist and educators and those before us have made some inroads in meeting the mental health needs and educational needs of a multicultural society. But we have failed to reach the majority of those who really need our help. We need you. In fact, it is up to you to take our work and build upon it, to extend it in new and creative ways. It is up to you to bring indigenous and western psychological services to the people in our diverse communities. We rely on you and we honor you for your efforts. Your committed efforts now in your schooling and your diligent work to come for decades because today I place so much responsibility in your hands, I honor you by requesting your permission to begin our lecture today. Thank you.

JOSEPH G. PONTEROTTO  Today I want to talk to you about a topic that I've been thinking about for quite a long time. It's relatively new concert(ph) for psychology and it is somewhat controversial. I will speak for about 30 minutes and we'll have about 10 minutes for discussion. I believe we can identify and measure in persons a narrow matrix of personality traits that cluster together to form a multicultural personality. Now, to be able to call this cluster of traits an actual personality, we must meet certain criteria as reflected in overhead two, which Rich has up. Personality, an individual's unique constellation of consistent behavioral traits. So the behavior is consistent and the personality trait is durable, a durable disposition to behave in a particular way in a variety of situations. So, this behavior transcends many contexts. Let me start with the definition of the multicultural personality then I'll share a bit about the evolution of my thinking, then I will slowly deconstruct the definition of the multicultural personality into its component parts so you can all see where the theory actually came from and I'll end with a very brief review of research testing two aspects of our theory. Overhead three, thank you, Rich. Now, as I read off these 12 characteristics of the multicultural personality, I'm gonna ask you a favor. I hope you have a pen. I'd like you to rate yourself in each of these 12 characteristics. Give yourself a one if they don't apply to you at all. Give yourself a five if they really emulate you and this really describes you accurately. So one to five, and be objective. So at the end you'll have a score between, ah, 12 and 60. Okay. So let me read them off and then you can score yourself, get you actively involve in today's lecture. " Emotionally stable." Looking around, I don't think we should go above one or two on that, ah, only kidding of course. "Secure in his or her racial ethnic other identities." Again one to five, give yourself a number. "Actively attempts to learn about other cultures and interact with culturally different people." So active attempts. " A spiritual essence and a sense of connectedness to all persons." " Wide-reaching and empathic abilities." " Self reflective and introspective." I know I'm going quickly. " Cognitively flexible and can deal with ambiguity." "Has a good sense of humor." "Effectively negotiates and copes within multiple roles in cultural context." "Understands the biases inherent in his or her worldview and actively learns about alternate worldviews." " Understands the impact of internalized racism and homophobia and/or unearned privilege in his or her personal life." And "Is a social activist, empowered to speak out, against all forms of social injustice, racism, homophobia, sexism, ageism domestic violence, religious stereotyping." Okay, I know, you don't have calculators, but add up your score as quickly and let see what you get between 12 and 60. Oh, put the slide up. Thank you. Poor Rich. He had no idea he would be working today. I owe him a nice dinner. Okay. I did it last night. I got 34 out of 60. Who got higher than 34? It's okay if you did, I know I have a long way to go. All right, so we got quite a range there. Okay, lets look at slide number four, Rich, and see why, why is the multicultural personality important? What's the basis of my theory and why am I working, or we working on this area? It's pretty straightforward. I think those with higher levels of the multicultural personality are going to have higher resiliency, hardiness, humor, et cetera, et cetera, which will lead to greater satisfaction with life, with life, greater quality of life and greater psychological and physical health. So this are kind of, ah, strong hypotheses that I'm presenting at this point. Okay. Thank you. So that is the definition and my hypothesis regarding the multicultural personality. Now, let me move to the origins of my thinking on this new construct. This is to the students again. I also want a model for you, the process of theory development. All of you here today have the knowledge and vision to create your own theories. You do not have to be a genius to create a new theory. I'm an average person of average intelligence, and look, today I'm presenting our new theory. I think it takes three things to create you're own theory, those of you in grad school and in that process. One, being highly self-aware and introspective about your own life experiences, because most psychological theory start and emanate with our own experiences in this world. Being extremely well read across disciplines and then looking for connections between the different literatures and integrate it. And three, having the courage and perseverance to present something new that most people will initially disagree with as they have about my multicultural personality theory. Now, the origins of my work on a multicultural personality really started in my childhood and involved early life experiences. Then being observant of others behavior and then in adulthood reading life stories and biographies of leaders in the field, in the multicultural psychology field. Can we have overhead five there. All right. You're, you're okay there? Let me start with an impactful set of experience I, I had as an eight year-old. In 1966, my family, parents, myself, five brothers and sisters moved to Rome, Italy for 14 months. It was during the Vietnam War and growing anti-American sentiment throughout Italy, especially in Rome. Wanting me to learn my culture and language of origin, my parents enrolled me in a third grade intercity public school in Rome. My first four months was still in Rome and in school particularly were quite difficult as I was disliked simply for being American. Over time, however, as I learned the Italian language and learned the nuances of Italian culture, I began to feel empowered. I began to develop skills and a life orientation that made life fun and easy for me as an eight year-old in Rome. Whether I was dealing with my Italian peers and their families or other immigrant, American and English-speaking families, I had a worldview shift, so to speak. When we returned to the US, I continued to see the world through two lenses now and I was drawn to observe people that seem to effortlessly transcend cultures in their behavioral and affective states. One such person was my dad, Italo Ponterotto, a multilingual professor of languages. I was always taken with his ability to shift in and out of languages and cultures effortless, effortlessly and comfortably, sometimes three or four on the same day in terms of the people that he interacted with. Then as an adult I was drawn to reading life stories of pioneers in the multicultural psychology field and I began to notice certain characteristics and behaviors that transcended these individuals and some of you in the audience today. For example, if you look at overhead 6. Twelve pioneer life stories in the handbook of multicultural counseling. Reading them over and over again, I started to see some commonalities in the life experiences of these twelve brilliant minds; one, multiculturalism was at the core of their being. It wasn't just a set of skills but they lived and breathed their cultural identities. Introspective about their own experiences of oppression and its many forms, actively seeking contact with diverse others. They had a strong support system that transcended culture and gender. They had a spiritual and collectivistic sense about them, the sense that we're all connected in an evolutionary and spiritual way. They're all highly interpersonally comfortable and competent in many cultural contexts. All 12 had the strength and courage to fight social injustice in its myriad forms and continuously speak out time and time again. And all 12 channeled hurtful, painful, and frustrating experiences into positive, humanistic, and educational action and support of others, particularly others who they saw as disadvantaged or oppressed, or the underdogs. Okay, let me begin covering the theory. Now, I'm watching our time, I wanna make sure we have some time for discussion. And I wanna review briefly the seven anchors, diverse literatures that we drew upon to draw the definition that we read earlier, that's the characteristics of the multicultural personality. First, racial and ethnic identity theory, the last stages, you know, the final or the next to final stages of all 22 models of identity which, which we reviewed. The model of coping with cultural diversity by Hardin Coleman, who works with adolescents having to, ah, adjust in culturally diverse environments. Social psychology, the ground breaking work of Gordon Allport, 1954, The Nature Of Prejudice on a Tolerant Personality, worked on Universal Orientation And Social Psychology and then Universal Diverse Orientation And Counseling Psychology initiated by Marie Miville here, right here at the Teacher's College Columbia. Drawing on feminist psychology and gen, gender role research, and expansionist's theory of gender roles boring(ph) from African centered values in mental health, and then most recently venturing into Europe and studying the life and work adjustment of ex-patriot workers moving to Europe and Asia and Africa and the characteristics that predicted whether they would succeed in their new life in a new country. So those were the seven anchors that formed the basis of the theory. So you see how we're building it from pre-existing literatures. Let's break down the anchors starting with overhead number 8, in honoring Dr. Janet Helms by talking about racial identity. If you look at the last or next to last stages of many of the racial and other identity models, you'll see this commonality; there's a sense of connectedness to one's own racial ethnic heritage, openness to people of other cultural groups, cognitively flexible, seeks opportunities to interact with cross cultures, aware of possible internalized racism and unearned privilege, and again a commitment to social justice. Now, quickly if you look at the next two overheads, we studied all 22 identity models and in the last column, you'll see the final stages whether it's Cross' model, Kim's model of Japanese-Americans, et cetera, et cetera. Rich, the next page, White European identity model whether it's Helms', Derald Sue's, who's right here at Columbia, that we'll work it out for you (inaudible ). The biracial-multiracial identity models, the groundbreaking work of Sue Jean Misalitus(ph) at the University of Hawaii Medical School on multiracial identity and measuring that, feminist identity models and gay-lesbian identity models. All of the last stages have that common cluster of characteristics. And I'm going quickly but you're following the gist of building the theory? Okay. Next Hardin Coleman's dynamic work with adolescents, ah, in the mid-west particularly talks about different strategies for the coping to, with culturally diverse new environments, in different stages, ah, or options that you see there, separation, assimilation, enculturation, et cetera, et cetera. There's some relationship with (inaudible ) a lot from Vois's work on biculturalism, Manuel Ramirez' work on bicultural, ah, skill development, and to state that most closely resembles the multicultural personality's integration, where both cultures are deeply integrated into the personality structure, and the person becomes bicultural, maintaining her/his culture of origin and incorporating language, customs, and values from the host culture. In balancing multiple roles, this is gonna come up time and time again, as bicultural and multicultural coping skills. I wasn't very familiar with social psychology but I went back and studied particularly Allport's classic, ah, the Nature of Prejudice. How many of you read that 1954 book? Okay, the rest of you, highly recommend classic and, written 52 years ago, reading it now, it's like he's writing today. He talked about empathy skills to the board strectum, spectrum of people. He defined it as flexible capacity to know another state of mind and to adapt to it, so not just know it, but adapt to it, self-aware, introspect of looking inside for responsibility rather than projecting outward. He actually used the phrase, "intropuni, intropunitive." Rather than blaming someone, we look inside for a cause and responsibility first, and then react based on our own self and examination first. Self-analytic, tolerance for ambiguity, cognitively sophisticated, some of the same terms keep coming up. And unique to, Allport's work is sense humor, I don't know if any of you were surprised by that definition in the, in the, ah, multicultural personality, and here's what he said, quote, "one who can laugh at oneself is unlikely to feel greatly superior to others." Think about that. How many here have a good sense of humor? Okay, I'm sure you all do. (laughing) Okay. We're already up to slide 13, you see, so we're moving well, thanks to Rich. In social psychology, the work of, ah, social psychologist Phillips and Ziller, Ziller in the early 1990s developed the theory of non-prejudice and the Universal Orientation Scale, and they thought that if we look more at similarities, maybe we'd stop hating and hurting people who were different. And then, in the late 1990s, Mary, Marie Miville at Maryland and in Oklahoma now at TC Columbia, many of our colleagues and students looked at universal and diverse orientation bringing it together which reflects a level of multicultural awareness and an attitude of acceptance toward both differences and similarities among people. The shared experience of humanity, humanity creates a sense of connectedness, there's that connectedness again. Influenced by my wife, Dr. Ingrid Grieger, in the back; Ingrind, raise your hand. Ah, and other feminist writers, ah, work on expanding gender roles on the feminist's view of psychology, particularly Burnett's and Hyde's meta-analysis of many studies and they had three principles about gender roles. One is multiple roles are beneficial to women and men. Who, who, let me have, see the men raise, raise their hand. How many men do we have here? Okay. One concept is buffering, a rewarding role can offset a stressful role. Thus if my work life is very stressful but I come home to Ingrid and our son, Marcus and daughter-in-law, Wendy, et cetera, et cetera, that might buffer my stress at work. Multiple roles, increase opportunities for social support widens a ray of context in which success can be experienced thus enhancing self-confidence and self-efficacy, facilitates expanded frames of reference and increase self-complexity and multiple roles promote a similarity of experiences which result in improved communication with one's significant other. Ingrid, how is our communication? Okay. Who else is here as a couple? Lisa and Rich? (inaudible ). Okay. However, principle two, there is an upper limit to the number of roles one can play given the time demands, so too many roles will lead to overload in emotional and physical stress. How many of you feel that now? Just too overloaded? Okay, more women than men I see hands raised. The quality of roles is more important than a number of roles. Finally, gender differences in personality, workplace behavior, and family behavior are smaller than hypothesized. Gender differences are neither large nor mutable, and that therefore the magnitude of male-female differences does not support highly differentiated life roles. Again, similarity, theory brings us together and maybe we can get along better. Born from Native American culture and African-American culture and our elders, I have just African-American on the slide number 16, the work of Linda James Myers and James Jones and Thomas Parham and Jon Yudsy(ph), Carlon(ph) Lee, I see another as Madonna, there's so many, I don't wanna mention names, I know I'll skip some. But Linda James Myers defines the concept of spirit and spiritedness(ph), that permeating essence we come to know in an extrasensory fashion, within the spiritual material anthology, we lose the sense of individualized ego mind and experienced the harmony of the collective identity of being one with the source of all good. Think if we all felt that towards one another, how much less violence and war there might be. Then James Jones' TRIOS model from Delaware, time, rhythm, improvisation, morality, spirituality, so I drew on all of these models in our work on the multicultural personality. The most recent exploration for me, which is very exciting 'coz I was really limited reading mainly American and, and North American journals and I really wanna urge all of us to read beyond our country, and there's so much great research in multicultural psychology of the European and African and other journals, Asian journals. So I came upon the work of Karen Vandersi(ph) and Peter Van Udenhoven(ph), ah, in the Netherlands who worked for corporations helping, ah, ex-patriot workers adjust to life. So corporations like Xerox and IBM were spending hundreds of thousand dollars to send American families to Asia, to Africa, to other places, and within weeks, the people wanted to come home again, they couldn't adjust to the, to the life, to the work. And companies are losing lots of money and you have psychologists who, who were there to answer questions. So, they studied in a fabulous systematic, ah, way, ah, the characteristics of people who are gonna successfully adapt to these new cultural work environments and life environments. They developed a multicultural personality questionnaire, which I'll talk about briefly later. And the five components that we drew on from this work in Europe is cultural empathy, we talked about empathy before; open-mindedness; social initiative; emotional stability, that's where that came from early in the definition, from the work in Europe and flexibility. Okay, take a look at overhead number 18. This is how we bring it all together. I'm missing the African and the Native American circles in this particular version. But in the outer circle, we have broad conceptions of personality like Coaster McGray's(ph) big five that transcends, ah, all of us. Then within that, we have the multicultural personality which is made up of these separate components, and research in personality psychology has proven without a doubt that narrow personality traits are better predictors of actual human behavior than the broad models of behavior. So if we can identify and measure, ah, the multicultural personality, it has tremendous implications I believe. Now, we have scales and instruments fortunately to measure all seven constructs and that's what we've working at trying to pull that together. Okay, then we're doing good on time. I'm gonna extend just a few minutes really integrating quickly the research, ah, just because it will overwhelm me to go into too much right now, and I'm gonna focus in two areas. One is a narrow construct of the seven universal diversal orientation, and then the broader construct, construct which is the multicultural personality work with ex-patriots in Europe. So first, let's take a look at Marie Milvel's(ph) work and many of her colleagues and students. Ah, I found 22 studies published in 16 different articles that used either her long or short version of her scale, all of them in the US, most of them focused adult university samples, two with practicing school counselors, et cetera. So collectively, when you pull together the hundreds of correlations and the regression equations that the researchers used, here is what we find in terms of significant, ah, relationships. Higher levels of universal diversal, again, same similarities and differences come together. In counselors, they have perceived higher, ah, multicultural competence and perceived higher ability to connect with others interdependent, ah, self-construal. General adolescents and young adult, college student's levels of empathy, maturity, these are all diverse studies, acceptance of diverse others, academic performance, people who scored higher in (inaudible ) had higher grades, and general psychological health, strong findings there. In all of the findings across these studies, this, the effect sizes were small to medium which is consistent for research in psychology and medicine. Now, let's go to the multicultural personality, 91-item questionnaire that's available in Dutch. Leone(ph) did a translation into Italiano and there's a UK English version and our US English version of that with the permission of the European researchers. Ah, most of these studies were in Europe with only two studies in the US and most of them used, ah, ex-patriot workers or international students, and let me summarize briefly the findings. Those higher and some of the multicultural personality, ah, traits, again there are five factors and research varies a little bit depending on the factor, but had much more interest in international career work. Higher job satisfaction, particularly if they're working in multicultural environments with multicultural colleagues. Much more multicultural activity efforts and stress scenarios coped much more effectively with stress, perceived peer and mentor support was higher and their physical health was better. Not just psychological coping but their physical health, you're gonna live longer, I think, if you have more of this personality. Furthermore, of course as expected, it was related somewhat to broader personality measures like the Big Five but the correlations weren't big. And with hierarchical regression models, ah, it was shown that these multicultural personality factors predicted variance above and beyond any variance accounted for by the general personality factors. Okay? And now the last overhead, so I wanna thank you all for being so efficient with me in getting through 21 overheads. What, what are our next steps for the research teams at Fordham? And I see Fordham students here and, and, and around the country. Here are some theoretical and research questions. We wanna study more closely the multicultural personality overlap with and uniqueness from general personality models, not just the Big Five, others as well. We're working towards better integrating the separate seven anchors of the multicultural personality. We're working now on a new measure that includes all seven components, 'coz right now we're just looking at measures that measure each one in trying to pull it together and that's limited of course. So we wanna develop a new multi-item measure that taps all seven components, and that is a multi-process of, of validating a measure like that and, and students have a lot of exciting work ahead of them. Now, if early research does support, it's just hypothetical now, this theory and the practical validity that if you have higher levels of it, it's gonna be good for you. If that's proven early in the research, then there are other implications as in number five. How does it progress? When does it start? So it's developmental progression. In personality research, there's a lot of heritability components of certain personality traits, temperament and things like that. So we wanna partner with neurobiologists, neuropsychologists, and take a look at, at paternal and identical twins studies in terms of multicultural personality. How much of it could be inherited, how much is just life experience and other factors. Finally, design studies to test interventions aimed at increasing levels of the multicultural personality throughout the lifespan. Parent training, obviously we have to start early; early childhood education programs; programs for high school and college students; corporate training for work at home and abroad and so forth. Now, first I'm gonna thank Rich again. Now, I'm gonna thank you for listening, and now Rich and I would like to give voice to the audience and maybe we can get some questions and discussion, all those of you doing we're doing similar work. We have at least 10 minutes I think, right? To have some discussion interaction, questions.
