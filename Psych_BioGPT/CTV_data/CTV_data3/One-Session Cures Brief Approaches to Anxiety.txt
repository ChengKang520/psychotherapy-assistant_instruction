CYNTHIA Welcome, everyone. My name's Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker, and welcome to this Networker webcast series on anxiety, what is it, and how to fix it. So in this series we'll have, we're talking to a number of accomplished clinicians with different ideas about anxiety and different interventions, different models and different methods. Today, it's our pleasure to talk with someone who I consider one of the more provocative thinkers and contributors in our field whose idea that even the briefest of therapies is most of the time not brief enough. We'll be talking with him today and finding out why he thinks that and looking, uh, what's exciting is we're gonna actually see him at work with and demonstrating a couple of methods that, uh, can work and, uh, and you'll judge for yourselves, uh, but it works, seems to work with astonishing rapidity in helping people with some serious anxiety issues. So it's my great pleasure to introduce my friend, Steve Andreas. Steve, how are you? 

00:01:20
STEVE ANDREAS I'm good, thanks for being here. 

00:01:20
RICH SIMON All right, so let's, let's set this up. I mean, this, this is, I appreciate that you've, uh, given us a couple of clips so we can really see very concretely what you're talking about, but you have a, a notion, uh, and your work is really premised on the idea that when you can really understand in a, kind of a micro-detail people's inner experience, therapy can work with what most people would consider a really astonishing rapidity. So talk to us a little bit about what makes that possible, what's, what is the, in terms of the, what, what's your ideas about what is it that's the difference between therapy that can work within a session or a matter of really a few moments and the therapy most of us practice. 

00:02:10
STEVE ANDREAS Well, the key thing is to go inside the black box and find out what's really going on inside somebody's head, and words don't usually do that. Uh, what's really important is what kind of images they make, what kind of, uh, talking to themselves, what kind of feelings do they have, and that's not only emotional feelings but also tactile feelings, uh, in their fingertips and on their body and so on. And that's basically the nuts and bolts, and most of that is unconscious for most people, most of the time. And so the way I work usually with people is to illicit what's going on inside and it's usually preconscious, but can become conscious if you ask the right kind of questions. Um, ask the right kind of questions, you find out what's going on inside, then you make changes there and then that actually ends up with changes in the unconscious functioning in the person. 

00:03:00
RICH SIMON And, and you are, um, the focus of your kind of interventions are at a level of detail that's different than most therapists I know, that the, the, the way in which they illicit internal experience. So, so, so with anxiety, for example, somebody's coming to you with a anxiety issue, and we're gonna see this in just a few moments, but tell, tell us a little bit to set, set this up. What's your mindset, what are you trying, what are you looking for in your initial encounter with a client who's coming to, uh, and presenting an issue where they have a problem with anxiety. 

00:03:40
STEVE ANDREAS I wanna know exactly how they developed the feeling. Most people, uh, have a panic attack or anxiety attack and it's, it's like as if it drops out of a cloud on them, suddenly it happens. Now, it doesn't really happen that way, but they haven't learned to pay attention. A lot of, uh, one way of talking about what I do is it's "directed mindfulness." Uh, mindfulness is great and I totally approve of it, but if you just sit and you're mindful, that doesn't give you the nuts and bolts of how to be mindful on, in a specific way so that it really, uh, you find out what's going on and make a difference. So in terms of anxiety, the anxiety usually, the feeling usually starts in some part of the body and moves to some other part. Sometimes it starts as a knot in the stomach and then comes up through the head like this. Sometimes it starts out here, comes in through the head, goes down in the stomach. You have all sorts of weird stuff goes on. And, uh, literally there is a pathway for the anxiety. Sometimes it even loops around and gets worse and worse because it comes up through here and it comes around and it comes down here and it gets more and more. It's like a vicious, a, literally a vicious circle. Now, if you find out how that works, then you have a chance to make some changes in it, and you can make the changes directly without talking about the content or their history or anything like that. A lot of people work with history, and history creates structure. Someone has a horrible experience, they get PTSD, now they've got the structure of PTSD. But you don't have to go to the history to work with the structure. The structure is here and now in the moment. 

00:05:15
RICH SIMON Okay. All right. Okay, so, you're gonna show us this in action. You're gonna show us, um, what you mean by this internal structure and this kind of, uh, directed mindfulness that is, gives you the information that you need in order to make the kinds of rapid changes that some of the methods that you use are able to accomplish. And, uh, why don't you set up, we're gonna, we're gonna see this, uh, a clip in just a few moments, what is it that, uh, what do you wanna say to us about this clip before we actually see it? 

00:05:45
STEVE ANDREAS Well, the main thing I wanna say about it is that it's weird as hell. 

00:05:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:05:55
STEVE ANDREAS And I thought so too the first time I heard about it, but I, I tried it, it worked perfectly for me. I did it with myself which is another thing, uh, uh, I like things that people can learn to do themselves so that they're empowered and they don't have to go to a therapist for forever to continue on their path. 

00:06:10
RICH SIMON That's, that's for sure. Okay. 

00:06:10
STEVE ANDREAS Uh, but despite it being weird, it was, uh, it took only a couple minutes to try, and I tried it, and it worked perfectly for me with the certain difficulty I had. And that, that sold me. It was a matter of trying it out and finding out that, yes, it works for other people too, I'm not just a weird old codger. I mean, I am a weird old codger, but, uh, not that's, that weird or that special. It works, and so I use it. And I don't have to understand how it works. And that's often true in any field. Often there are discoveries and at first, people go "What? I don't know how this works." But if it works, it works, and then later on sometimes they figure out how it works. 

00:06:55
RICH SIMON Okay. All right. So, uh, I hope people are intrigued. What we're gonna do now, uh, we'll have plenty of time to talk about the clip, but, uh, let's, let's move into seeing, uh, Steve at work and seeing what you're gonna see now, uh, is about a, a nine-minute clip of, uh, someone coming in with a, an anxiety issue and you'll see how, uh, Steve applies his method. 

00:07:20
STEVE ANDREAS Let me say one more thing about it before we start. Uh, there are three segments in the clip. The first segment is where she tells me about her problem and I'm gathering information. The second session is, section is about 15 minutes later when I do this, this method which is called "spinning feelings." And then finally, there's a follow-up with her a month later when she's, she has had a chance to, uh, test this. 

00:07:45
RICH SIMON Okay. Great. Okay. Enough said for the moment, so, uh, sit back and enjoy a extremely intriguing demonstration of the spinning feeling technique. 

00:08:00
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, so tell me about what goes on with you when you play in public. You freeze up or you? You said "panic," you use the word "panic" a little bit, I don't know. 

00:08:05
CYNTHIA Yeah, it, it is panic, and, um, it's, it's actually physical as well as, as mental and emotional. Um, you know, obviously, I'm nervous when I play, and most people are nervous when they play, even people that aren't debilitated by it, but, um, I get to the point where I literally can't think, like I can't see the next notes that are coming at me, and my eyes go blurry, and sometimes the keys even get blurry, so it's like I can't see what's going on, I can't think. 

00:08:35
STEVE ANDREAS You really check out, don't you? 

00:08:40
CYNTHIA I just completely just want to get the hell out of there. It's like, can I be anywhere but here, you know? And then I worry about, oh my God, I missed that note, and then I'm gonna miss the next note, and then I'm thinking, "Okay, I just missed those notes, but where can I get to in the music to keep things going?" and it's, it's blank. And it doesn't matter whether I'm playing from score or whether I'm playing from memory. 

00:09:00
STEVE ANDREAS Doesn't matter. 

00:09:00
CYNTHIA Yeah, and it's just, I mean, I hyperventilate, I hold my breath, I sweat, it's just. There's supposed to be joy in music! 

00:09:10
STEVE ANDREAS Right. When you get the, that response to next, it's a... 

00:09:15
CYNTHIA Yeah, it is. 

00:09:20
STEVE ANDREAS Tell me more about your feeling. I want more details, like, for instance 

00:09:25
CYNTHIA Physical feeling or emotional feeling? 

00:09:30
STEVE ANDREAS Um, well, it's both, but it's primarily emotional feeling I'm talking about. 

00:09:30
CYNTHIA Fear. 

00:09:35
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:09:35
CYNTHIA It's just like... 

00:09:35
STEVE ANDREAS Now, when people have feelings like that, particularly strong feelings, it often seems like, bang, it's just there. All, all together. I want you to slow it down a little bit and tell me where does it start in your body? Like it might start here or here or here or wherever. 

00:09:50
CYNTHIA It starts in my gut. 

00:09:55
STEVE ANDREAS Starts in your gut, okay. And then where does it travel? 

00:09:55
CYNTHIA Goes to my heart. 

00:09:55
STEVE ANDREAS Goes to your heart. So it goes... like that, right? Okay, good. And how big is it? The path? 'Cuz it goes, you know, how big is it down here and, and as it moves up, does it get bigger or smaller? 

00:10:10
CYNTHIA It feels small when it starts, and it feels tight and small and immediate. And then it swells. And when I feel it in my heart, I notice it in my breathing, and then I notice that I sweat, and then I notice that it's like my brain gets foggy. 

00:10:30
STEVE ANDREAS Right. Okay, good. Now, as you're gesturing up, it's not just your heart. You gestured like this, like it goes 

00:10:35
CYNTHIA Yeah, it feels like it just kind of sweeps over the whole top of me. 

00:10:40
STEVE ANDREAS Got it. Wonderful, good. Now, here's another weird question. As it moves from this small, tight knot, uh, into this, this big sweep, which way does it spiral? Does it spiral this way, or does it spiral that way? 

00:11:00
CYNTHIA Wow. 

00:11:00
STEVE ANDREAS Weird question, huh? 

00:11:00
CYNTHIA Yeah, and I don't know if it spirals. I don't. If it spirals, it spirals this way, but I didn't think of that until you mentioned it. I felt like this. 

00:11:15
STEVE ANDREAS Right. You felt mostly the, the motion from the small knot to the big. 

00:11:20
CYNTHIA Yeah. But if I do like this, that feels wrong, like it wouldn't be that way. 

00:11:25
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, so it's the other way. Okay, great. Okay, so you're gesturing like this, and here's what I want you to do. I want you to go back to that, the next, and the knot starts here and then it goes up, and spiral it in the opposite direction, which for you would be this way. 

00:11:50
[sil.] 

00:11:55
STEVE ANDREAS And just notice what happens. Give me a little 

00:12:00
CYNTHIA It's like resistance. 

00:12:00
STEVE ANDREAS Resistance? 

00:12:00
CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:12:00
STEVE ANDREAS And how do you, how do you, what is it you actually feel that you're calling resistance? 

00:12:10
CYNTHIA Um, like a tightening between here and here. Just, it's tightening rather than going. It's, it's stuck, if that makes sense. It's stuck. 

00:12:20
STEVE ANDREAS Now, when it's stuck, is it still unpleasant? 

00:12:20
CYNTHIA Yeah. Like worse. 

00:12:25
STEVE ANDREAS Like worse? 

00:12:25
CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:12:25
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, 'cuz it's kind of bottled up? 

00:12:25
CYNTHIA I feel like I can't breathe. 

00:12:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Interesting. Okay, that's a different thing than most people experience. Let's try something, a little modification. Try again, again starting with the small knot, and spinning it in the reverse direction, put some sparkles on it and spin it faster. 

00:12:50
CYNTHIA Spin it faster in the reverse direction? 

00:12:55
STEVE ANDREAS Correct. 

00:13:00
[sil.] 

00:13:35
CYNTHIA Well, that was better. 

00:13:35
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:13:35
CYNTHIA But I visualized it like a, one of those 4th of July firecracker things, the, the sparkler deals, and it just kind of fizzled away, I guess. 

00:13:45
STEVE ANDREAS So did the feeling itself fizzle away as well? 

00:13:50
CYNTHIA Yeah. Yeah. 

00:13:50
STEVE ANDREAS Now, would that be okay with you if whenever you think "next" that it would just kind of fizzle away that way? 

00:14:00
CYNTHIA I could work really hard to employ that, yeah. 

00:14:00
STEVE ANDREAS What if it were easy? Would that be okay? 

00:14:05
CYNTHIA That'd be better. 

00:14:10
[sil.] 

00:14:10
One Month Followup Interview 

00:14:15
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, Cynthia. Thanks for coming back for a follow-up. 

00:14:15
CYNTHIA Sure. 

00:14:15
STEVE ANDREAS And I'm eager to hear what happened at your concert. 

00:14:20
CYNTHIA Well, um, it was, it was actually good. I was disappointed because I wanted to play the harder piece, um, and I fell and sprained my hand a little bit so I, I couldn't, my hand hurt too bad, I couldn't play the bigger piece, but I played a couple of smaller pieces that didn't require that kind of movement. Um, and the thing that was really strange about it is I remember just sitting there, enjoying, um, the other people that were playing, I was like fifth or sixth, whatever, and I got up there and did my thing and I sat back down, and one of the other ladies said to me, she was like, "Wow, you seem really calm today. What's different?" And it didn't even hit me until after that. I was like, "Oh, yeah, I didn't freak out!" 

00:15:00
STEVE ANDREAS Wonderful! 

00:15:05
CYNTHIA I was completely calm. I had one, I remember having one little point of time in the middle of, of the second piece where I got a little bit keyed up. 

00:15:10
STEVE ANDREAS Little tensed up or something? 

00:15:15
CYNTHIA Yeah, but I was able to just brush that off, um, so I felt really, really good about it. So I wanna keep practicing the technique, um, because I am gonna play the bigger piece two weeks from now. 

00:15:25
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:15:25
CYNTHIA Yeah, so if I can get through the big piece, then I'll know for sure that this is like a, a real revelation for me. But I'll share something else with you, um, and this was really special, um, as a teacher, the thing I struggled with is trying to help my students not to have stage fright. And it's really an individual thing. Some of them have it from the first day, others never, ever have it. Well, I have one, one female adult student, and she's had it from day one. And she sings, so she sings really well, and she can sing anything in front of anybody, but, um, when she has to play the piano, she's like a wreck. Just a wreck. And so 

00:16:05
STEVE ANDREAS Interesting. So she's fine singing? 

00:16:05
CYNTHIA Yes! And to me, I mean, don't even, I can't even imagine how singing in front of people would be, you know? But she's fine with that. So I taught her the technique that you showed me, and we did it in our lesson and we practiced it, and then I brought her out on the stage, not during the concert, but, you know, during our regular lesson time, and, and had her play out there, and we worked through that process a couple of times, um, and then the next week she had her recital, and she completely nailed it. And I remember she jumped up and down on the stage, and she was just like, "Yes! Yes! Yes! It worked!" And everybody was like, "What's wrong with this girl?" But, I mean, she has had serious breakdowns and almost in tears all of her other recitals. So she's thrilled. And I was thrilled for her, so. 

00:16:55
STEVE ANDREAS Wonderful. 

00:16:55
CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:16:55
STEVE ANDREAS Well, this is terrific. 

00:16:55
CYNTHIA Yes, it was great. It works for me, I was able to teach it to somebody else. 

00:16:55
STEVE ANDREAS So did it work? 

00:17:00
CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:17:00
STEVE ANDREAS Sounds like it to me! 

00:17:05
CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:17:05
RICH SIMON Okay, well, we're back. Uh, quite an interesting demonstration. So before we even get into the, the method and, uh, talk with you, Steve, about what you see is going on, the thing watching it that strikes me is just the way, the way in which you're physically in sync with this woman, uh, where you're, where you're sitting, your gestures, the way you're paralleling each other is, is, um, that the, uh, there's a kind of a, a rhythm to the, to the way you're, you're talking with her. Is that something that you're particularly aware of as you're working or is that something that has become second nature to you? 

00:17:50
STEVE ANDREAS Well, a little of both. It's second nature, but I now, but, uh, the main thing is that when she talks about her problem, I'm in there with her in the sense that I'm taking it on. I'm not in her, with her in the sense of freaking out as you, as you see on (inaudible ) and, in that sense I'm not with her in her, uh, her problem, but I'm taking on what she describes as if it were happening to me so that I can understand it better. 

00:18:20
RICH SIMON Okay, right. And so you're taking it on, and you're a little bit outside it so you, you laugh and it's sort of like the way she might, at some point in the future, regard her problem when has a little bit of, uh, distance from it. But you're, you're, you're there with her so it feels very much like you're with her, this isn't just a application of a method, uh, to, uh, to a subject. Now, um, so ta-, take us into, so one of the, the other thing that's striking is you're asking questions at this level of detail that people who are not, uh, most therapists would, uh, not ask questions at this level of very precise inner experience, so talk to us about that. What are you trying to do in this first part of this, uh, intervention? 

00:19:05
STEVE ANDREAS I want her to really notice, and again, directed mindfulness, I, I might trademark that. 

00:19:15
RICH SIMON And that's nice! 

00:19:15
STEVE ANDREAS Um, really notice exactly what goes on inside her, uh, body when she has this, uh, anxiety. See, anxiety is just a name. We really don't know if two people who use the same word have the same experience at all. In fact, it might be totally different. But they can get in touch with, uh, how they experience anxiety and where it starts and where it goes to and begin to, that kind of knowledge, uh, offers an opportunity then to change some different aspects of it and find out what happens. Actually, um, although sometimes I'm asking questions, mostly I'm directing her attention, I'm asking her to actually do something. Essentially I'm saying, "Pay attention and find out where does it start, where does it go to, what is its shape" and, uh, at the time I did that, I was playing scientist and doing, uh, one variable at a time. So I was just doing the spinning feelings, but you can also ask what color is it, uh, and, uh, as well as the shape and, uh, something else I can't think of right now. That's crazy. 

00:20:20
RICH SIMON Well, you know, with what you're saying to yourself, were there other dimensions or other modalities of inner experience. So she's, so you're asking her to directly report to you, and so you're tracking that, but you're really asking her to get below, beneath the filter of language and what's the actually, you wanna, what's the experience, what's the immediate, at the most immediate level she can get of what's going on inside. 

00:20:40
STEVE ANDREAS Right, and there's another example in this. Uh, after she does it the first time, she says "There's resistance." Well, I don't know what "resistance" is, that's just a word. So I said, "What do you experience when you use, that you're labeling with the word 'resistance?'" and then she talks about, "Well, it comes up to here, and then it stops." That tells me concretely what's going on. And then I ask a little more to find out, well, it didn't work, it actually made it worse. So then I have to try something else. And one of the frames I use when I, uh, first meet with someone is, look, I'm gonna ask you a lot of questions, some of them will seem really weird, I'm gonna ask you to try out a lot of things, some of them will work, some of them won't work, we'll find out. And you're the judge of what works and what doesn't. Uh, I'm the judge of what to try to try and make the experience different. 

00:21:25
RICH SIMON Okay. So you ask her about her feelings, she asks you, she's not quite sure what you mean by "feelings," she's doing a little bit of, uh, what you do right back at you, and then, then you direct her at first towards her, you say "emotional feelings," but really what you wind up discussing with her and asking her to report back on is, uh, a physical sensation and then some other, um, experiences in her, her, in her experience of that, what begins with the physical feeling. So is there some, some reason you direct her to, uh, the emotional aspect of feeling initially? 

00:22:05
STEVE ANDREAS Well, she's concerned about anxiety. That's what most people would call an emotional feeling. Now, all emotional feelings have tactile qualities you feel in some place in your body. It's, uh, you know, pleasant or unpleasant or weird or overwhelming or not and so on and so on, and so I'm just trying to get more details about exactly what she feels and how and where she feels it. 

00:22:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. And that, but that, at that point, you get very much, and so the external whole situation and circumstance becomes, uh, uh, it really moves off and we get into this, this feeling, this tightness, this, this what's going on and, at the gut level, lit-, almost literally, gut level of feeling. So tell us about, what, what are you listening for there, what are you, as you're working with her, what are you thinking? 

00:23:00
STEVE ANDREAS Well, in this particular process, I want to focus her attention on what is essentially a visual representation of what has previously only been overwhelming feeling. So as she describes it starts here and goes up, I'm sure she has visual imagery that goes along with this. When I ask which way does it spiral, pretty much that, you can feel it, but you can also see it. If I were to ask her what color is it, that would make it explicitly visual. So I'm, part of the, part of the process that I think I understand is that it's translating a feeling into a visual representation and then making a change in the visual representation which then goes back and affects the feeling. But exactly why this spiraling makes a difference, I don't have a clue. Now, I don't care 'cuz it works. 

00:23:45
RICH SIMON So now the spiral comes out of, you introduced that, she's taken back, she has no representations so she would 

00:23:55
STEVE ANDREAS She has no idea. 

00:23:55
RICH SIMON She has no idea what, but you're just asking about a spiral, not because that's the most natural question, which direction does a feeling spiral in, it's not because that's the most natural question in the world, but you have had some previous experience with this method which works for reasons that you're not, still not aware of, and has something to do with this, the direction of the, of the spiral, of the physical sensation inside someone's body. 

00:24:25
STEVE ANDREAS Right, right. 

00:24:25
RICH SIMON And, and so you 

00:24:25
STEVE ANDREAS Part of, somebody else discovered this, I just grabbed it and ran with it. 

00:24:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:24:30
STEVE ANDREAS And actually, I should, I should give a little credit to Nick Kemp in the UK because he's the guy who really put this together and also the other one that I'm going to, uh, demonstrate. 

00:24:40
RICH SIMON All right, so take us through from, from that point. So you're giving her, um, so we, we have, we've reversed the spiral, and then there's a series of, uh, visual suggestions of different ways in which she can represent this sensation in addition to the, the change of direction. So say more about what's, what's going on at that part of the, the, uh, and what is it, from your viewpoint, what are you trying to accomplish as the therapist here? 

00:25:10
STEVE ANDREAS Well, basically, I'm following a procedure and a process that says if you reverse the spiral and you're adding color and you add in sparkles, it's gonna make a hell of a difference. And as you saw, it changed it, and it happened very, very quickly, and, um, I should say a little more too in the roughly 15 minutes between what you first saw and what you, what the actual doing the spinning feelings, I gathered quite a lot of information about her, uh, internal experience, what she says to herself, the tone of voice that she says to herself, she had a critical voice and so on. And, uh, I gathered a lot of information, I tried some other interventions that did not work, but when I did, when I did the spinning feelings, that really nailed it, uh, for her. And different people respond to different kinds of interventions, and it's wonderful to have a whole variety of things that you can do because then if one thing doesn't work, you can try something else until you find something that really clicks with the client and that really makes a difference for them. And now, the first time, it made it worse. Well, that's curious. That hadn't happened to me before, so I went, okay, now what? Okay, let's spin it faster and add the sparkles. And there's something about the sparkles that really amplifies it. The, the key thing is the spiral. If you do just the spiraling, it will often work just by itself, but the sparkles and changing the colors is better, kind of dresses it up, makes it more vivid in the person's mind, it makes it more powerful. It's an amplifier. 

00:26:40
RICH SIMON Or you can put some sprinkles, some whipped cream on it, and see if that works, as well. 

00:26:40
STEVE ANDREAS Well, let's, let's not mix things up too much here. 

00:26:45
RICH SIMON All right, so the sparkles, now, is that, again, that's just something, just like the spiral, there's no a priori, there's no reason that that should work. Is that part of what Nick Kemp had come up with or is that something you had discovered had worked when you were trying to, trying this method with other clients? 

00:27:00
STEVE ANDREAS Uh, it's what Nick Kemp came up with. And it's, it, we just found out that it, it works and it amplifies it. 

00:27:10
RICH SIMON Okay. So in this way of working, in a very short span of time, the, the first piece of it in terms of the structure of, of how you work is you want to see if the intervention has an immediate impact. And that's, that's, that's the original thing. So you have the, uh, you have her report on her internal state. 

00:27:30
STEVE ANDREAS Right. 

00:27:30
RICH SIMON Okay. So is it 

00:27:30
STEVE ANDREAS Not only, not only report verbally, but respond nonverbally in a way that's congruent with the report. 

00:27:40
RICH SIMON Okay. And so 

00:27:40
STEVE ANDREAS Which is very important. 

00:27:40
RICH SIMON That's very important, that's, yeah. So you're, uh, so there's a real, oh, kind of a hallmark of what you're talking about is a real, um, skepticism about what people say and the degree which what they say matches their inner experience, and so you're always checking out that verbal report versus what you're seeing and, and really challenging them to translate just language, broad descriptions, into more precise description. 

00:28:05
STEVE ANDREAS I'm definitely a skeptic. 

00:28:10
RICH SIMON Okay, and we've, I think we've established that. 

00:28:10
STEVE ANDREAS But I like to test. 

00:28:10
RICH SIMON And test. Okay. So at this, so what, but for this, it's, what else would you say for you to feel like, okay, this client is ready to test this, this change out in the world, what is it that you want to have seen happen? What do you want to have tested involves? 

00:28:30
STEVE ANDREAS Right. First I, first I look for the change in the session itself, and she, she says, you know, "Oh, it's fine. The feeling just kind of fizzled out." We joke about whether it'd be okay if that just happened by itself in, uh, in the music performance situation. Now, what I then did is I spent the next 20 minutes or so taking her through a whole bunch of rehearsals, first going back to past disasters, uh, and having her do it there, first intentionally. So go back to a time when you really choked up and the whole thing fell apart and so on, do the reversals of the spinning, and find out how that works there, and then, uh, do another one, maybe two or three in the past, and then do some in the, into the future. And the eventual test is to, what happens if you don't try to do anything? And the idea is that if you rehearse it a number of times in the past and you make changes in past experiences, and then you go into the future and you, it's what we call "future pacing" or "rehearsal's" the more ordinary name for it, where you're going into the future, trying this out, and eventually you test it by saying, "Now just go ahead and do it, another future situation, try it out, and just find out what happens. So don't try to do anything, don't do the spiral or change the thing, just find out what happens." And when you get to that test, that's really the best test you can do in the office where you are now. The ultimate test, of course, is in reality, and often people will say that. Well, it's fine here, but how about the real thing? And I say, "All I can say is 'Of course. The real test is in reality.' This is just, we're doing the best we can to make sure that you're all set up for the real, uh, experience." 

00:30:10
RICH SIMON And, and so you want to see in that, that future pacing and that rehearsal that something automatically is happening without the client trying to do anything, say things to themselves, you just wanna see that it's, that it's kind of a natural, a natural response. Uh, so if, when you, for whatever reason, it's not working as, uh, as quickly, um, as, as it is with this client, and what, what goes through your head and what is it, what's, what is it that you, you do if you can't seem to get that response within the session? 

00:30:45
STEVE ANDREAS Then I try something else. 

00:30:50
RICH SIMON Is there something in this particular, would, would you have, uh, at this point, so it maybe it's not the spiral, you might move back into the internal dialogue some, so you might focus on some other aspect of that person's inner experience, of thinking, well, for whatever reason, maybe that's the key variable, that modality is more prominent in the way they construct their, uh, their anxiety, let's say? 

00:31:15
STEVE ANDREAS Right, and in this particular case, I spent about 15 minutes gathering a lot of information about the voice and the tonality and so on. We tried some experiments with changing the tonality with, uh, changing the content of the voice 'cuz the voice is saying things like, "You're gonna screw up," and things like that. And it, it made some difference, but it didn't really nail it, and so I went, "Okay, then I'll try something else." And so then I went to the spinning feelings. If that didn't work, then I'd try something else, and there are lots and lots of things I have to try, and so it's just a matter of futzing around until you get something that works. 

00:31:45
RICH SIMON Yeah. And it's highly em-, empirical. So you, you're, you're, there's an outcome, and if you don't see that outcome, you're tapping into your, whatever the interventions, whatever you can think of until you, you get that outcome. 

00:32:00
STEVE ANDREAS Right. 

00:32:00
RICH SIMON So then she comes back, um, and, and this, this is, uh, some time later. How much time had passed between? 

00:32:10
STEVE ANDREAS One month. 

00:32:10
RICH SIMON A month, month's time. 

00:32:10
STEVE ANDREAS You know, she did a concert, it was perfect. She did, uh, concerts once a month, and it happened to be, uh, like, two weeks from the session she had a, another context, content, concert. 

00:32:25
RICH SIMON Trying to spit anything out, like spit out through your brain, okay. 

00:32:30
STEVE ANDREAS And, uh, so two weeks later, she came in, and I had no idea, by the way, we had not talked, I didn't know anything about what had happened or what she was going to say which was really a treat. 

00:32:40
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. No, no, it, it's, you know, it's very fun. She looks so different. And what's striking, and I think is, from what I understand, you're often character-, it's not as if she's so exultant about it, there's a quality where she's, um, downplaying it a bit, in my viewing of, of, of her response. How would you describe it? 

00:33:05
STEVE ANDREAS Well, this is, this is a sign of what you did really, really worked when people forget that they had a problem and they just go into a situation and it's like any other situation. I mean, imagine you had a phobia of doorknobs or something like that, and I, and I fixed it, then when you walked up to a door, you wouldn't go, "Oh, I don't have a phobia of doorknobs!" You'd just open the freaking door. It would be ordinary, and that's really the best test of really, really good work is if people forget that they had a problem and they behave very nonchalantly as, because now it's just like all the other things they know how to do. And that's, that's something that's often kind of ignored. You know, people have all these skills and all these capacities and all these things that they do excellently, and they don't think about them that much because they're so ordinary. It's like the fish, last one to discover water. Uh, that's what you really want where after you've made a change, you don't want people, uh, freaking out by, and saying, "Oh, gosh, now I can open a doorknob!" 

00:34:05
RICH SIMON And what's also striking is this, not as if she's showing very grateful to you for having, um, helped her with this difficulty, she feels, she's feeling quite, rather casual about this, rather nonchalant, in your words, and, uh, and also that it's, it's very empowering, that is, and, and she, and then, of course, the, the grace note here is now she's, uh, she's teaching this very method to her students. What, what do you make of that? 

00:34:30
STEVE ANDREAS I love it. It doesn't happen all the time, but when it happens, it's a real treat. And that really tells me that, uh, what I, what I do, a lot of people say, "Oh, well, you know, it's because of you and your experience or this, that, and the other." Something like this happens, I go, "No, it's the method." You don't have to be practiced or famous or anything else like that; it's the method that really does it. 

00:34:55
RICH SIMON So let's, we're gonna go to another clip in a moment, let's just try to put this into the context. If, if most people are like me, this is a pretty impressive demonstration of a, of a, of a problem, a real issue in woman's life. You've, uh, you had a, a session with her, uh, spent a relatively short period of time. It, it certainly seems as if she's, uh, at the point of this follow-up, at least, that she's, uh, that this problem has essentially, um, uh, disappeared from her experience. She's not 100% sure, she's still, she's still who she is, but, uh, she's certainly it's a very dramatic change. Do, do we have any further information about her in a more long-term follow-up? 

00:35:40
STEVE ANDREAS No, I don't. I should've gotten that, but I didn't. I did get it on the next clip that we'll see. 

00:35:45
RICH SIMON Okay, so, you know, perhaps we'll get that and we can put this on the comment board or something. But okay. So now, put this in the context of, um, of therapeutic practice. Are there that many issues of pe-, of people coming in to therapy where you think that if we had methods and we had the kind of observational skills and the kind of precision that you're demonstrating in this particular session that we could in, in a very brief period of time make this kind of profound difference in somebody's life? 

00:36:20
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah, there're a lot of things that we have now developed a particular protocols or processes, sequences of, of, uh, experiences that work very, very dependently. Uh, shame, guilt, uh, grief, uh, PTSD flashbacks, it's, uh, not, not the larger meaning of, of the event, but, but that often pales into guilt and so then you can use that method and so on. Uh, there, now, there's plenty of things I can't do. I saw a whole bunch of clients not too long ago on the camera and, uh, a bunch of them I didn't help at all. So it's not like I can do this all the time. Uh, and there're other issues too. Some people come in and they don't really wanna change, and so then your first job is to get them to want to change because if they don't wanna change, then they won't cooperate. All you need is cooperation. You don't need, you don't need belief. Uh, I've got some great videos where people are totally, totally, totally skeptical, but if they're willing and, and cooperative enough to go through the process, they'll get the change. But if they're not willing to cooperate, then they won't get the change. 

00:37:30
RICH SIMON So your, your assumption, it's, it's, it's if, if, if you can really understand the structure of the experience, the, the troubling experience that the client is having, whether it's guilt or phobia or, or, uh, panic, uh, shame, if you understand that structure, you can intervene, in the way you're intervening here, on the way in which that person creates that inner experience for themselves and in a short order of time, uh, make an enduring change. Is, is that correct? 

00:38:05
STEVE ANDREAS Yes. Absolutely. 

00:38:10
RICH SIMON And then if, if we don't under-, in contrast to it, and there's a, a range, human experience is complicated, so in the range of experience, where we don't yet or you don't yet understand the structure of that inner experience, you, it's not as if there's any magic here. 

00:38:25
STEVE ANDREAS Well, if it looks magical and it, it still seems magical to me even though I've done it a bunch of times. 

00:38:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. But there's, there's no magic in, if you don't understand the structure of the experience, uh, and, and if the intervention doesn't change 

00:38:45
STEVE ANDREAS Then I don't know what to do. 

00:38:45
RICH SIMON You don't know what to do. Okay. All right. 

00:38:45
STEVE ANDREAS And, you know, three years ago, I wouldn't've known what to do with the spinning feelings. If somebody came to me for anxiety, I'd would go, "Well, I don't know what to do." And now I do. And I didn't invent it, but boy, I'm sure grabbing onto it. 

00:39:00
RICH SIMON So with the spinning feelings, what's, what's your batting average? What's your, uh, experience with using this particular method with clients who're coming in with anxiety as their presenting issue? 

00:39:15
STEVE ANDREAS Close to 100%. 

00:39:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:39:15
STEVE ANDREAS Now, there may be other issues. Sometimes people have anxiety and it has a positive function. In this case, there's no real positive function. She gets up to play piano and freaks out. But sometimes anxiety has a positive function to get you out of the situation or to protect you in some way. And then you have to build in coping skills so that they can deal with whatever the situation is that they would otherwise have to leave because they can't cope with it. So often there's, uh, in the next clip we'll see, uh, an interesting example of, of "follow-on," that a, a method works with what she presented, it, uh, that then created a new problem. 

00:39:55
RICH SIMON Okay. All right, so let's, let's 

00:39:55
STEVE ANDREAS Let's go to the next clip. 

00:39:55
RICH SIMON Let's move into the next clip. So why, why don't you set this up for us. What, what do we need to know in order to understand this situation? 

00:40:05
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. This is in a training context, we're in training the method, and it's a method that works with the, with an internal dialogue that happens just before an unpleasant feeling. A lot of people don't realize that when they have bad feelings, very often there's an internal dialogue that triggers it off. Now, most people work with the words of the dialogue, the meaning of the dialogue. And I do work with that a little bit here, but primarily I work with nonverbal aspects of the dialogue, the tempo, the tonality, uh, various other nonverbal aspects because that's what really, usually triggers off the emotional response. And I just ask for someone who, uh, had a feeling that they didn't like in a certain set of context and, uh, that they hadn't heard about this particular method. It was in a training seminar. And that was it, so maybe that's enough. 

00:41:00
RICH SIMON All right, fair enough. All right, well, uh, here we go. So here's another clip of Steve at work and working, focusing here on, uh, another modality, another aspect of, uh, inner experience and the, the, the tempo and the voice quality of the, of one's inner dialogue. So let's, let's see him in action. 

00:41:20
STEVE ANDREAS So you got some situation where you respond in a very strong way. 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:41:25
STEVE ANDREAS And you'd rather not. Is that right? 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:41:25
STEVE ANDREAS Good. Now, do you have any objections to not having that? Is it gonna be really okay to have that? 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN I think so. 

00:41:35
STEVE ANDREAS Disa-, disappear or mutate into something else? 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:41:35
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Put yourself into that situation now. 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:41:40
STEVE ANDREAS Do you feel the feeling? 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:41:40
STEVE ANDREAS Great. Now, in that situation, what is it you're saying to yourself just before you have that feeling? 

00:41:50
[sil.] 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN I think it's "I can't do it." 

00:41:55
STEVE ANDREAS "I can't do it." That ought to do it. 

00:42:00
UNKNOWN Exactly. 

00:42:00
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. "I can't do it." I'm gonna put it up here so we can all. Okay, "I can't do it." 

00:42:10
[sil.] 

00:42:20
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, now, when you say that to yourself, is it in your normal tonality or is it faster? 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN I think it's normal. 

00:42:30
STEVE ANDREAS Think it's normal? 

00:42:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:42:35
STEVE ANDREAS 'Kay. And you just checked once. Check inside again. Just right now, you go, "I think it's normal," about like that. Is it like that or is it faster? 

00:42:45
UNKNOWN It's like how I said it, like "I can't do it." 

00:42:50
STEVE ANDREAS What's that? 

00:42:50
UNKNOWN It's, it's "I can't do it," like that. 

00:42:55
STEVE ANDREAS About like that? "I can't do it?" Maybe a little faster than normal, but basically about the same. 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN Maybe, yeah, a little faster maybe. 

00:43:00
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, great. Okay, I'm gonna ask you to do several things. First, just say it in your normal, the normal way you just did. 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:43:05
STEVE ANDREAS "I can't do it." About like that. To yourself. You don't have to say it, 'cuz you don't say it out loud, do you? 

00:43:10
UNKNOWN No. 

00:43:10
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Do it inside. 

00:43:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:43:15
STEVE ANDREAS "I can't do it." Now slow it down by about a third. Say the same words. 

00:43:25
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:43:25
STEVE ANDREAS What happens if you slow it down by about a third? 

00:43:25
UNKNOWN It's more relaxing. 

00:43:30
STEVE ANDREAS It's more relaxing. Okay. Great. Now, I'm gonna say your sentence first and, just to give you a, an exact idea of what I want you to do, and then I want you to do it internally in the same tempo that I use. Okay? 

00:43:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:43:45
STEVE ANDREAS I. Can't. Do. 

00:43:55
[sil.] 

00:44:00
STEVE ANDREAS It. 

00:44:00
UNKNOWN Okay. All right. 

00:44:05
STEVE ANDREAS So say it like that internally, okay? About that tempo. 

00:44:10
[sil.] 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:44:25
STEVE ANDREAS Now, what do you experience when you do it that slow? 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN Well, it's a little depressing. 

00:44:30
STEVE ANDREAS Little depressing. 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN But it's less anxious. 

00:44:30
STEVE ANDREAS Less anxious. Okay. So it still doesn't feel good. 

00:44:35
UNKNOWN It's better. 

00:44:35
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. A lot better. 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:44:40
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Let's do something else then, make it even better. Okay? 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:44:40
STEVE ANDREAS You up for that? 

00:44:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:44:45
STEVE ANDREAS Print out the words, out like on a billboard. Okay? Got it? Where does the billboard, it looks up fairly high? 

00:44:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:44:50
STEVE ANDREAS Nice and high, nice banner? 

00:44:50
UNKNOWN On that wall over there. 

00:44:50
STEVE ANDREAS And, oh, way over on the wall. 

00:44:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:44:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, great. So how high are the letters? 

00:44:55
UNKNOWN Like this big. 

00:45:00
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Are they bold face or san serif or? 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN They're, um, bold. 

00:45:00
STEVE ANDREAS Bold? Great. So black on the wall? 

00:45:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:45:05
STEVE ANDREAS And you can see them through the pictures and everything else, no problem? 

00:45:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:45:10
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, great. Now, take those words and spread them out. You can even use your hands if you want to. So you spread them way out so they're, and then notice the space between the words. 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:45:25
STEVE ANDREAS Attend to the space between the words? 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:45:25
STEVE ANDREAS And then spread the letters out as well. And then attend to the space between the letters? 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:45:35
STEVE ANDREAS And then say the same thing to yourself internally while you, while you look at those, those letters up there. Actually, the space between the letters. 

00:45:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:45:50
[sil.] 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:45:55
STEVE ANDREAS What does that do for you? 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN It's frustrating. I like, I wanna just like, break them. 

00:46:00
STEVE ANDREAS You wanna break them? 

00:46:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:46:00
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, let's do that. 

00:46:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:46:00
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Close your eyes. 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:46:05
STEVE ANDREAS And you can see all those letters up there. And I want you to delete this apostrophe and the "t." 

00:46:15
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:46:15
STEVE ANDREAS Just fuzz them out, just make them disappear and you know they're gone because when you look, you can't see them. 

00:46:20
UNKNOWN Right. Oh, okay. And they're still spaced out, right? 

00:46:25
STEVE ANDREAS Uh-huh. Or you can bring them back together if you want now. 

00:46:35
[sil.] 

00:46:40
STEVE ANDREAS What's it like now? 

00:46:40
UNKNOWN I'm, I, it's harder to do. 

00:46:45
STEVE ANDREAS It's harder to do? What's harder? 

00:46:45
UNKNOWN I mean it's taking me a little bit of time to get rid of the, the apostrophe. 

00:46:50
STEVE ANDREAS Oh, I see, you haven't got rid of it. Close your eyes. Picture them inside. And you're not getting rid of them, you're just allowing them to fade away. You know, sometimes a mist comes in on the mountains or something like that and you can't see the mountains anymore? 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN Okay. Okay, yeah. That worked. All right 

00:47:10
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, what's it like to see there? 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN It's surprising. 

00:47:15
STEVE ANDREAS It's surprising? And it looks like it's pleasantly surprising, is that right? 

00:47:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, it's kind of, um, it's good. But I look like I don't, it's not good, but it's like, wow. It's, sorry. 

00:47:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, we've got some Kleenex here. Now, it looks good to me. 

00:47:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:47:35
STEVE ANDREAS We'll explain to them in a minute, okay? You just, just, just. 

00:47:40
UNKNOWN It's just I've seen those for a long time so it's like, wow, that's kinda cool and, um, it's hard to believe. 

00:47:45
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. Okay. 

00:47:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:47:50
STEVE ANDREAS Have your, have your tears fully. Stay there a little bit longer. 

00:47:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:47:55
STEVE ANDREAS Stay there a little while. Just, just be with them. I think I would call these tears of relief. Is that right? Something like that? 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. I mean, it's a little scary 'cuz I've had those for, you know, I've had "I can't do it" for a long time. 

00:48:15
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

00:48:15
UNKNOWN But it feels good now. 

00:48:20
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Close your eyes and hang in there a little longer. What is like to see those words, "I can do it?" It's a little scary, it's unusual, little bit sad for all along, all the time that you had the previous thing, right? 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN Um, I haven't even thought about that yet. 

00:48:40
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN It's more like, oh, I don't know. I can't. 

00:48:50
STEVE ANDREAS Taking a while to, for this to become familiar for you. 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:48:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:48:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:48:55
STEVE ANDREAS All right. Have anything else you'd like to report? 

00:49:00
UNKNOWN It just feels more round. 

00:49:05
STEVE ANDREAS More...? 

00:49:05
UNKNOWN More round. 

00:49:05
STEVE ANDREAS More round. Like 

00:49:05
UNKNOWN In a good way. 

00:49:05
STEVE ANDREAS Like soft and full? 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:49:10
STEVE ANDREAS Is "full" a good word? 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN Or just, yeah, like not edgy. 

00:49:15
STEVE ANDREAS Not edgy. 

00:49:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. So it feels good. 

00:49:15
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:49:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:49:20
RICH SIMON We're back. What a, what a sweet and touching demonstration that is. Um, you know, just kind of a classic moment that many of us would love to see with our clients, especially here's this young woman at the beginning of her life and there's that sense that something really important has had, and we have no idea what the content of that is and in the context of this demonstration, it doesn't particularly seem to matter right now. So let's, um, so Steve, uh, let's go through this. So, so what stands out for me, uh, in addition to this very moving experience that, that you shared with her and I think many of us share as we're watching this, we have no idea really what's, what's going on in terms of the content of this, only that some-, something is very moving to her and her sense of enhanced possibility. So you started this off about, you, you mentioned, you check in with her about possible objections, so talk to us about where you, why you start, start with that. 

00:50:20
STEVE ANDREAS Well, whenever people have symptoms or problems, um, sometimes they're just relics from the past. Sometimes they have no relevance in their current life, they don't have any impact. But very often, they, they do have some kind of positive intention or positive function and what's often called "secondary gain," and I wanna find out about that, and I wanna find out about it up front, and I wanna find out about it at the end. And so usually I ask right at the beginning when I'm proposing to make a change or help them make a change, I say, "Is there any problem if, uh, you know, really think this through, is there any problem if you no longer have this response?" And of course, I'm going on the nonverbal response as well as the verbal. And it's, it's really important because sometimes you don't wanna change things. Uh, for some, and unless you change something else first or make some other arrangements so that the person's protected in whatever way they need to be protected. And a lot of what's called quote "resistance" quote is damn smart. Uh, they know something that I don't know or that the client, the therapist doesn't know, but if they made that change, it would actually not be, uh, worthwhile overall. 

00:51:30
RICH SIMON So this, this is a classic therapist mistake that leads to, as you say, resistance and, uh, gets you to bark up the wrong tree. So, okay. 

00:51:40
STEVE ANDREAS I eat, I eat resistance for lunch. As soon as somebody says, "I, I'm, I don't wanna do that," or "I'm concerned about that," I go, "Great. Great. Great. Let's really find out about this," and then I go into that and deal with that and then come back to the original outcome. 

00:51:55
RICH SIMON And throughout this, the, "great" is a, a prime therapeutic intervention here 'cuz you're responding to everything that happens in the session with that, in that tonality. "It's great," with the, and the, what it suggests to me is, uh, you, we, we are making progress here. There's, there's nothing you can say that's gonna throw me, uh, we're gonna get somewhere. So it's, it's a very potent part of kind of the, the alliance element of what you're doing in addition to whatever the, this, this method, uh, provides. 

00:52:30
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah, it's a very, very simple thing that, uh, I think people can integrate into any, any, uh, approach or any theoretical, uh, foundation or whatever. Whenever the client tells you something that's interesting or useful or good information, you just say, "Great. Okay, great." And just as in like a casual way like that. It's not, "Oh, great!" It's a "Okay, great." And that leads me to think of another thing. Um, when she's done here, she's saying "I can do it," in a fair-, fairly soft voice. Now, to contrast that with some of the motivational speakers that get people all whipped up with, with loud music and stuff and then being, throw their arms in the air and "I can do it!" It's a whole different experience. And this, what you, what you saw in this one video is the one that I trust. 'Cuz it's, again, it's fairly nonchalant. It's like, "Oh, I can do it." And it's unusual for her, it's very touching for her 'cuz she's had a lot of experiences of "I can't do it," of feeling bad, but, uh, now she can do it. 

00:53:35
RICH SIMON Yeah, okay. Yes. So it's kind of understated, uh, uh, sense of, uh, kind of a quiet confidence. All right. So then, then we, you begin to explore this, the way in which, as, as you've, uh, as we've been talking about, you're trying to get into how she constructs her inner experience of this obstacle, of a sense of limitation, whatever it happens to be, we're not quite sure what it is, and you, you, so you ask her to, uh, about how she says it to herself, and not just to report on it, but to have the, not just to describe it, but to have the inner experience and tell you about it. So describe what you're, you're getting at there and, and the process that you're going through with this young woman. 

00:54:15
STEVE ANDREAS Well, let me relate this back to anxiety because I didn't ask for, uh, both of these methods work for anxiety and they work for a lot of other strong feelings too. So they should be one of the first things in a person's toolkit for, what do you call it, uh, emotional regulation is the, is the, the buzzword these days? 

00:54:35
RICH SIMON Self-regulation, yeah. Okay. 

00:54:35
STEVE ANDREAS Self-regulation, yeah. My thing there, it's perched now there. Um, I lost my train of thought. 

00:54:45
RICH SIMON Well, you wanna say that this is a technique not just for anxiety but a range of things that are emotion-, about emotional self-regulation, yeah. 

00:54:55
STEVE ANDREAS Thank you. Now, if she was anxious, see, if she just kind of, in the, "I can't do it," she just got a little down and depressed, if she were getting anxious, nine time-, 99 times out of 100, the voice would be much faster than her normal speaking voice because anxiety typically is created by a very fast voice. And I'm sure this is something that learned, when, that's learned. When you're a kid and your parents want you not to run out in the street, they don't say, "Don't run out into the street." You know, they're probably screeching at you, probably in a high pitch and a very fast tempo because they need to get the message across. Now there are a few people who, uh, actually have a slower than normal tempo in anxiety. And they probably had parents that said, "Get out now," or something like that. And this is, this is not backed up by experimental, uh, evidence or proof, but that's my guess about this. And it's these nonverbal things that usually are, trigger people off in these bad states rather than the words. I mean, the words aren't, are part of it, but most people focus on the words, and they're only a part of it, and, uh, it's the nonverbal aspects that are much more important. 

00:56:10
RICH SIMON And the, and the nonverbal aspects that you're focusing on are first tonality and then tempo. 

00:56:20
STEVE ANDREAS Right. 

00:56:20
RICH SIMON And so we, you, you work with her, and again, you're having her checking in with her and having her try out in her, the feeder of her, her experience, these different, which she, uh, so, so what, what are we getting at here? What are you, what are you trying and what are you, what's the information that you're getting out of what's, what's going on between you and her? 

00:56:45
STEVE ANDREAS Well, the process essentially takes what is, uh, normally a, a short little sentence, "I, I can't do it," and spreading it out and making it longer. It's changing the tempo. When you change the tempo of something, it changes the impact, the emotional impact. Now, when I first did this with her, it didn't make a lot of, uh, change in her. It made it a little better. It made her a little relaxed, but it wasn't, didn't get the whole, uh, nine yards, as they say. So then I transferred into the visual representation of the same thing, the banner printed out on the, on the wall. And one of the key things there is what's called "figure, figure ground," that if you spread this out and then pay attention to the space between the words and then spread out the, the words and pay attention to the space between the letters, figure ground alone is a very powerful intervention. Whenever people are in difficulty, they typically have tunnel vision, they're focusing on a particular problem or what's not working for them and so on. Simply to say, let that recede into the background and notice the background and have the background come forward can make a real state shift. I have to do other things as well, but as a, as one piece of intervention, that's a very powerful one. 

00:58:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah. So she, you, you go through some tonality shifts, you slow it down, she, she says she's, that she's, um, a little more depressed, uh, less anxious but a, it's a bit depressing to, uh, to hear, have her, have that self statement come out in that way. And so you keep experimenting with her and trying to, having her try out things and then checking with her how that affects her, what's her response, positive, negative, how does that shift her anxiety, shift her mood, does it move her further towards something positive or, or, or not. 

00:58:35
STEVE ANDREAS Absolutely. The word "try out" is key there. I have a lot of, got a lot of things people can try out, and I have ideas about how they've worked with other people in the past and what's likely to happen, but there're all sorts of surprises and, um, then we try something else. 

00:58:50
RICH SIMON You never know. And then this, so when you, when she's having spacing out of the words and you've shifted modality from the auditory to the visual, and then she has that, that initial, she has some problems with that, that isn't, uh, such a positive experience, she's a little confused, she's having some difficulty with it, and then you, you, uh, have her, this idea of, of, your initial idea is that, uh, uh, spacing them out, and then you, you move into this idea of turning "I can't" into "I can." Now, is that something that occurred to you in that moment or is this something that in, you've had experience with? 

00:59:25
STEVE ANDREAS No. This is another particular piece. Now, often people say things to themselves where there isn't a negation, but if there's a negation, it's very, very useful to do this little piece, it's like an additional piece within the piece, of fading out the apostrophe and the "t." You have to be careful about how you talk about it because if you say, "Change 'can't' into 'can,'" that's much too intellectual, that's much too verbal. But if you say, "Look at the, look at the sentence up there and allow," and again, that's a hypnotic command, "allow the apostrophe and the 't' in the second word to fade out, and you know you can't see them anymore because when you look, they're not there." That's a little mini-hypnosis thing. And it didn't work for her right away. She was, at first, she was struggling with that, so then I used what's called a, uh, "mini-reference experience." I said, "You know how when you see the mountains and the mist comes in and then you can't see the peaks anymore?" or something like that. And then she got it instantly. You could see, you could see her shift right away. People can replay and go back and, uh, see it. That made it totally easy for her, and very often, that's the case. Somebody may say, for instance, that, uh, "Pictures are jumping all around, I can't, I can't keep them still." And I say, "You know how that, how Velcro sounds when you put something down on Velcro? A little... like that?" and make an actual little sound, and then they go, "Oh, now the picture stays put." So put a little Velcro on the back of that picture, stick it down on the background, and suddenly they can do it. And this is because they're accessing some kind of piece of memory or neurology, however you wanna talk about it, that exactly fits what they need in that particular situation. 

01:01:10
RICH SIMON And, and that's what you mean by a mini-reference experience. 

01:01:15
STEVE ANDREAS Right, it's a, it's a, an experience that refers to something that they have experienced in the past. 

01:01:20
RICH SIMON Okay. Because what, what's going on, this is the, the, uh, how in sense, at a level of detail that most of us don't experience in such a precise and meticulous way, that this, if we track what happens in both these demonstrations, it's a series of these mini-experiences. It's not about interpretations, it's not about, um, uh, labels, it's about having these experiences that, that are alternative experiences to the distress that these, uh, that these, uh, these, these clients, these, these, uh, these women are having, uh, and, and you're calling attention to those. 

01:02:05
STEVE ANDREAS And it's also, you know, it's more than that, it's the experience that they're having, um, usually at an unconscious level or a preconscious level, not at the level of ordinary consciousness. So if you take ordinary consciousness, it's not gonna get there, you know? Conscious mind can do wonderful solutions for conscious problems, but if they're not working, then you gotta do something else. You gotta go somewhere else. And this level of detail is very, very important. 

01:02:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. So this, uh, well, the, you know, as we've seen. So it's, it's this, uh, kind of liminal, it, it would be hard to, someone watching this I imagine, trying to describe to somebody else what we've all been watching here in terms of the process, the, this kind of, uh, it's, it's hypnotic, there's a, this kind of liminal journey that people are taking through different alternative ways of experiencing very familiar emotions within them, and they keep coming back to your very positive, uh, uh, very accepting, um, very in tuned presence guiding them to the next, the mini-experience, what kind of wonderful little thing is gonna happen next. Great. Here, here we go where something is going to happen that's going to be different than this distress that I'm used to experiencing. 

01:03:25
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

01:03:25
RICH SIMON And so now, and so, and then what's, what's so touching is when, is, uh, is her, her tears and this very sweet moment that you have. So talk, talk about what that was like for you in the session. I imagine this is something you, you experience, um, with some regularity, these, and, and the way you label those tears in really, uh, an important part of the, the gift that you've given this young woman in this session. 

01:03:55
STEVE ANDREAS Well, it's not so much me labeling them as, I used some words to find out, to make sure that I'm correct in my assumption. They look like the soft tears of resolution or reintegration than whatever other good words you might use, but I wanna check and make sure. And I think a lot of therapists, I, I've even seen some articles about this, and many therapists are afraid of tears. Oh, I think you, they had an article in a recent Networker about that. 

01:04:20
RICH SIMON Yeah, of all places. Absolutely, yeah. 

01:04:25
STEVE ANDREAS Of all places! And, uh, there're a whole bunch of different kinds of tears, and these are kind of tears of relief or integration. 

01:04:30
RICH SIMON Well, what a, what a lovely phrase. I, I thought that was a, a, a great, you know, a really, and she certainly, most importantly, she, uh, it captured her experience. 

01:04:40
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. This is not the tears of moaning about losses and things like that. This is not the tears that often go with screaming or freaking out. These are very nice tears, and they're lovely, I, and noticed she, she kind of wants to jump out of them and, and get on with the show, so to speak, and, uh, I encourage her several times to just stay with them because this is integration, the change happens, but the integration of the change can sometimes take a little longer, and I really want her to honor and respect those tears and remember them. I don't want her to jump out of it and do something else. 

01:05:15
RICH SIMON So there's, at that point, you very gently, you kind of touch her very gently on the leg as you're, as you're saying that. So is that, what's, what's happening there, what is it that you're, that you are doing at that moment? 

01:05:25
STEVE ANDREAS It's just a little additional contact, nothing else. Some people go, "Oh, you're, uh, triggering something or you're doing this that and the other," something like that. It's just a kind of thing, you know, when, when you're together with somebody and, uh, somebody's having a strong feeling, and you may just reach over and hold hands or touch them on the shoulder, something like that. 

01:05:45
RICH SIMON A reassuring touch. 

01:05:45
STEVE ANDREAS I wouldn't even call it reassuring. Reassuring sounds like, uh, that word to me means, "Oh, it's all right, it'll get better," and I don't think it gets any better than that. So it's not reassuring, it's just, "I'm here with you." I think that's a better phrase. 

01:06:05
RICH SIMON That's lovely. Okay. Yeah, I like that. I like that. 

01:06:10
STEVE ANDREAS And, uh, you know, a touch like that says that better than words. If you say something like "I'm here with you," then they have to kind of pop out into their conscious experience and process the words and think about them and so on, but just a touch like that, it's a very, you know, it's an important human thing. We're, we're animals that live in packs and touch each other and, uh, it's just, it's just like saying, "I'm here." 

01:06:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. And, and you definitely have, you have to be in tune with, with folks in order to do that, you know, to, in order to, for that to communicate that sense of just being with them, not, not, basically, yeah. So, yeah, it's, so that, there's, um, throughout both of these demonstrations, we just have a few more minutes here, so this, this, uh, there's a, a way in which you're trying to, uh, therapy is, can often be so talky, and what you're, so often seems like you're trying to do is, and that's because words are the shortcut that we use to get places in our lives, and what you're trying to do in this work is, uh, go to places where you, that are, are more anchored in people's experience rather than just verbal labels. 

01:07:25
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah, and another aspect of that is many years ago, Paul Watzlawick made a distinction between descriptive language and injunctive language. Descriptive language is "this is that," using lots and lots of words to describe something. Injunctive language is "try this out," "find this," uh, "do this and see what happens," uh, commands. They're gentle commands, but they're saying, "Okay, now make this picture. And now slow down the voice," or whatever it is. So it's doing something, and it's only through doing something that change happens. Giorgio Nardone has a book, I think it's called, uh, Changing Through Doing or something like that, and it was on doing things to make a difference. If you don't do anything, nothing happens, nothing really changes. You can talk about it till you're blue in the face, but nothing really makes a difference. But doing something, trying something out, you find out if it works. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't work. 

01:08:20
RICH SIMON And, and you, and you're giving people this ongoing experience of creating alternatives to things that they're quite used to, creating experiences for themselves by these very slight shifts in how they use their attention and what they focus on. 

01:08:40
STEVE ANDREAS And actually, having somebody try something out and do something is a real way of making choice and empowerment. Sometimes people say, will say, "Well, you have a choice," but if you don't offer them a choice, they don't really know what that means. But if you say, "Try seeing it this way," "Try changing your perspective," "Try looking at it this way," 'Try making the, the picture smaller," or "Try making the voice faster or slower," and so on, that's an operational way of actually making some-, giving someone choice. They don't have to do it, but they have the choice now. 

01:09:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah. So, all right, so, so now let's, we're gonna move back to this world of language and labels. We've got, been in this very precise liminal world of experience. What is this that we're talking about? Why, how, how do we begin to label this? Is this hypnosis? Is this neuro-linguistic programming? Is this Milton Erickson come round again? Is there, how would you integrate, if someone is interested in, uh, uh, the, the, what you demonstrated and is trying to understand how does this fit together, what do you say to them? 

01:09:45
STEVE ANDREAS Well, it definitely has its roots in Milton Erickson and also in Virginia Satir. She was always having people do things. She would talk, but she'd always have people do things, do, "Stand over here," "Crouch down," uh, etc. etc. She was always giving people commands. And she was, I think Milton Erickson was probably the greatest therapist who ever lived, and Virginia was close behind him. And so they've been some of my models. And yes, it has something to do with NLP, but I need to put in a, a disclaimer 'cuz a lot of this stuff going out, I don't know that all of it's called NLP, that I do not wanna identify with. So I stand behind what I do, and some of my colleagues like Nick Kemp who invented these two things, and some, a few other people in the world, and then there's a lot of stuff I really go like this to. I don't wanna have anything to do with that. 

01:10:35
RICH SIMON All right, fair enough. Duly noted. So if people want to follow up, I think, uh, they're interested in these methods and, so there's, is there a, is there, there's not a term, uh, that packages what you just described. There, you've been, uh, we're been discussing the operating principles and the, the actual methods that you're using. What would be, what is somebody who's intrigued by this, what would be the next step for them if they want to integrate more of this way of working into their practice? 

01:11:10
STEVE ANDREAS Well, I'm biased, of course, but I have a website, steveandreas.com, that has a lot of free articles. Uh, realpeoplepress.com has videos and a lot of clips, um, free clips and then if you wanna see the whole thing, you have to buy something, and books. Uh, those would be my, my first thing. I've got a new book coming out in late July called Transforming Troublesome Voices or something like, no, Negative Self-Talk. We went back and forth on the title. 

01:11:35
RICH SIMON Okay. We have to take, how to be the author of a bestselling book, you have to get the title of the book right. 

01:11:40
STEVE ANDREAS Have to get the title right! 

01:11:45
RICH SIMON You can show it on the screen! Okay, that's great. 

01:11:45
STEVE ANDREAS Well. 

01:11:45
RICH SIMON W. W. Norton, I, I hasten to add on your behalf, is your publisher. 

01:11:50
STEVE ANDREAS If I can mention one other thing about the last client, I've, I've got a feedback from her just a couple weeks ago. Here's what she says in the email. 

01:12:00
RICH SIMON Yeah, let's hear from her. 

01:12:00
STEVE ANDREAS "Before, I would have a path show up in my life and I would instantly feel overwhelmed and say 'no' and feel bad about myself. Now I say 'why not?' and have taken on many projects, so I need to learn to figure out what is good for me to do and what not, what is not." So it's kind of an interesting example. She, now she's, she doesn't say "I can't," she says "I can," and she goes out and does something, now she needs another little piece which is "How do I sort out, what is it, I need to prioritize and figure out, of all these opportunities that I can do, uh, what do I want to do and what do I have time to do and stuff like that?" So I'll be having a talk with her on the phone. 

01:12:40
RICH SIMON Yeah, okay. And, uh, uh, a, and that's, that's an issue, that's a problem in life that has much more expansive possibilities for her than "I can't." 

01:12:50
STEVE ANDREAS Yes. You know, it's a good problem to have. Now she has choice, no, too many choices. Before, she had no choices, now she has too many choices. 

01:12:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. I'll, I'll take too many choices. All right, well, that, that's it for now. Steve, thank you so much and thank you for bringing your work to us so people can actually see what we're talking about, we're not, we're not just describing in language something that may or may not bear any relationship to what, what somebody's actually doing. 

01:13:15
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah, most of the discussions I hear about therapy have no relationship to anything in concrete reality, and I really wanted to present what I do. You can criticize it, you can examine it, and you, but you can see what I do. And I've been railing for years about private practice. I think people oughta practice publically. Because then they get feedback of what they do, and believe me, I've seen a lot of videos and, uh, well, as you know, I've communicated with some of the 

01:13:45
RICH SIMON I've heard, I've heard my share. 

01:13:45
STEVE ANDREAS Observations that I've made, I think, you know, psychotherapy troubles from the Lake Woebegone effect. Do you know what that is? 

01:13:55
RICH SIMON What it, well, we, no. 

01:13:55
STEVE ANDREAS Where all the children are above average? You know. Something like 95% of therapists believe they're above average. Now, all you can say is some of them have got to be wrong. But there isn't enough public demonstration of stuff, and that's one of the things that Virginia Satir was so good at. She allowed herself to be videotaped, hours and hours and hours and hours of videotape. Maybe I'd better stop my rant.
