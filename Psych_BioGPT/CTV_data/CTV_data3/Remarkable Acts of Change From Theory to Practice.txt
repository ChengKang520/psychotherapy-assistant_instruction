HARRIET LERNER Thank you, Jeff, for that beautiful introduction, but now I have to be charming and erudite and, oh my God. I'm always amazed by Jeff and what he makes happen and how he brings all of us together in so many different ways. So there is -- actually it's Jeff who makes me think of an old folktale about this old man who is bothered by noisy -- noisy boys who would play outside his window. So he called the boys over to his side and he told them that he was getting hard-of-hearing. And if they would come back and make an effort to play more noisily, he would give them each a quarter. So the boys came back and they played noisily and he gave them each a quarter, but the next night -- I mean the next day, he gave them only 15 cents, explaining that he was sorry, but he was running out of money and then the following day he gave them only a nickel and the boys refused to come back. Because it wasn't worth their effort to play noisily for just a nickel and they weren't going to be ripped off by this stupid old guy. You know, I can help but wonder if this clever guy studied with Milton Erickson, because you know Erickson taught us that you can change the course of a river by blocking it, you have to accept the force and divert it in a new direction. And I also like this folktale because it reminds me that sometimes it takes imagination and uncommon sense to solve the riddles and relationships of life and it also reminds us that even when we think we've done everything, our clients have done everything, there is always something new to do after all. But when it comes to helping our clients navigate their most difficult relationships, which is my subject always. The folktale is too simple, it's too easy. By the time people end up in our consulting rooms, there are often drowning and difficult emotions and caught up in relationship struggles that have roots over generations. And as people try to get through to each other and set things right, they confuse their anxiety-driven reactivity with having a voice and sharing real feelings and speaking their own truths. And we know that anxiety and reactivity keep people stuck in dichotomous polarized thinking and dichotomous polarized positions. So their attempts to change things and solve problems just lead to more of the same. As people yo-yo back and forth between distance and blame and get over-focused on what the other person is doing wrong and under-focused on their own creative options to move differently. For our clients and for ourselves, we all have some relationship where a fog descends upon our brain and reduces it to mush. For our clients and for many of us, this happens in our family of origin. Family of origin relationships are all intense, many painful things happened before we even entered the picture. And if you think your family is not intense, that simply means the intensity is being managed through distance and cordiality, superficiality. So my younger son, Ben, the poet and novelist actually once summed this dilemma about family of origin up very nicely when my husband Steve was driving him back from the airport to our house in Topeka during Ben's sophomore year of college. You know, dad, Ben said, matter-of-factly, the closer and closer we get to home, I can just feel the layers of maturity peeling off me. I'm 68, and when I visit family members, certain family members, I still feel the layers of maturity peeling off me or it might be with your partner or boss or ex, that you know you clutch when you're just in the same room with that person. The older I get, the more humble I feel about relationships because if everything has come from myself and in the family, I can fancy myself to be a highly evolved clear thinking Zen Buddhist like person. But if I get anxious enough or angry enough, I have the brain of a reptile. So actually -- I mean for any of us, when anxiety and underground emotional intensity mount to a certain point, the most mature relationship can actually begin to look like the most dysfunctional one, which is why I love Mary Karr's definition of a dysfunctional family, which she defines as any family with more than one person in it. So that's my definition of a dysfunctional relationship is any relationship with more than one person in it. But actually I'm realizing at this moment that I -- one can have a dysfunctional relationship with one's very own self. You know, I do, maybe it only takes one. So in my talk I'm going to share 10 bold acts of change that help clients and ourselves navigate relationships wisely and well and promote maturity and differentiation of self even if a particular relationship fails. Before setting what I think, I just want to comment a little bit on how I think. The theoretical perspective, one major theoretical perspective that guides my work is family systems theory. I owe a great debt to Murray Bowen even though I disagree with him on many, many things and he wouldn't want to claim me as one of the tribe, feminist that I am and other things too. The -- and, of course, all of my life experience and all of my learning shapes my work, including what I've learned from people who are presenting -- many people who are presenting here today. Because that term family systems theory means something different to everyone who here said, I gave you a chapter handout that includes a very clear clinical vignette in which I am the unfortunate subject, that illustrates exactly what it means to think systemically. And I will just say briefly that thinking systemically, it's not about the headcount, it's not about if you have one person in the room or the whole family, it's not something you use with this diagnostic category and not with that. It has nothing to do with whether a therapy is very short or a very long conversation, I do both. Family systems theory is simply a way of understanding human emotional functioning. And like feminist theory, it's about pulling back the land setting and seeing a problem in context and appreciating the interconnectedness of all things. Since we're in California, I would quote John Muir who says, when you try to pull out any one thing, you find it connected to everything else in the universe. That's so -- it's so true. Just to give a very brief example of the importance for me of a multi-generational context, I also gave you a handout of a family genogram, which begins with a -- this very simple genogram and then there is a more complex one. How many of you, raise your hand, like print out the handouts and have paper with you? Oh my goodness, the world has changed on me. Does -- can you find this in your -- okay, some of you. Well, for those of you who can't, I'll sort of walk you through it, but basically illustrating, I -- I -- I get a genogram on every person I work with, whether I'm seeing them -- I have a three-session model or I'm seeing them over time. And this very simple one of a nuclear family, the mother came to see me, Mrs. Kesler, complaining that her son Billy was acting out in school, he was not being responsible. She was upset about it. It started in third grade when he was eight and she was also very mad at her husband who she felt was too hard on the boy. And with some questioning on my part because I want to get a sense of the interactional sequence in the family in which the symptom in embedded, it became clear that there was a very intense child focus triangle in which mother stood for love and understanding and dad stood for law and order and they would fight constantly about Billy's care. So -- and I described this in The Dance of Anger, I basically coached her to change that position in the triangle and to relate to her husband's competence to manage that relationship with Billy as he -- as he would. And then actually what happened then with the change in the marriage is that he became depressed and he came to see me. And during -- this is the genogram you probably don't have in front of you. But when I did dad's genogram, Mr. Kesler, it was very interesting, because one question I always have is why does things heat up when Billy was eight. Well, when you access this genogram in your handouts and you do the simple arithmetic of birth dates and death dates and the previous generation, what you see is that Billy's dad lost his dad at 36, which is the age that Billy's dad, Mr. Kesler, is at the time that the triangle became so entrenched and it's actually a double anniversary because Billy was eight and eight was the age that his dad lost his father. In fact, over several generations, sons had lost their dads early. And the reason the genogram was so helpful to me because I was very quickly able to help Mr. Kesler dad broaden the focus away from Billy, away from his son because it's the intensity of the focus on a family symptomatic behavior that makes the symptoms worse. And to help him to really look at the unresolved issues of loss and grief in his own family of origin and do some specific work up the generations, so that the intensity didn't trickle down the generations. This is the only trickledown theory that actually is true, I believe, and that what's not resolved in the earlier generations, the next generation will inherit. So I'd like you to take out your handout, but you don't have handouts and I gave you -- but this is very simple because there are bold acts of change. And I'll, you know, certainly tell you what they are, if you don't have them in front of you. An essential concept in systems theory and multi-generational work is differentiation of self and these 10 steps are the essential ingredients, I believe, in the process of differentiation. They look very simple. When I tell them to you, they will sound very simple. They are not simple, if you are dealing with a difficult person or a difficult issue. And what I mean by differentiation of self is, to put it most simply, that capacity to have a authentic -- have a self and yet stay connected to the other person and to have relationships that don't occur at the expense of the self and to have a self that doesn't occur at the expense of the other person. So I also want to invite you, most importantly as I go through these 10 things, I want to invite you to choose one, one thing that you will do differently in a key relationship, that you'll take out of here and do differently. And I say do differently because it's only after we make an essential change in a relationship and maintain it, can we actually see that relationship? And I also offer this invitation because it is my firm belief that therapy is usually, not always, but usually no higher than the therapist as someone put it and that there is so much to be gained whatever your model, your theoretical model is in working on one of these things. So let's go through them. The first is, this is for our clients and for ourselves and I coach people in all of these 10 things that we can say what we think and feel about things that matter. This is at the heart of differentiation of self to be able to say, this is what I think, this is what I feel, and this is how I see it differently. Now it's easy to speak to the differences if it's a flexible relationship or it's as -- if it's a very calm topic like sports and the weather, actually the weather is no longer a calm topic and where I live actually sports isn't a calm topic either. There -- there must be a calm topic like Meryl Streep and ice cream, right. We would all agree that those are really good things. So, you know, it doesn't take great courage to say, for example, I know you like chocolate, but I in fact prefer vanilla. But if what you are going to say is a very hot issue and it's going to stir up a lot of reactivity, it can take a lot of courage to define the differences. And I remember a very difficult conversation I had with my mother in Topeka, she was in her 80s, she was in assisted living and we had had an ongoing not good conversations about some of my father's not very honorable behaviors that had occurred decades earlier. And I remember going to her and saying, you know, I want to talk again with you about dad. And we see it very differently and it makes sense that we see it differently because you are his wife and I'm his daughter and let me tell you how I see it. And then I proceeded to do so, you know, without trying to convince or change or -- and you know, and then I asked her what it was like for her that we saw this so differently, what was the hardest thing for her. And I asked her to help me understand why it was that she was so anxious that I see it her way that poor guy, his mother, it was his mother's fault, he couldn't help himself, he did the best he could. What was so difficult for her that that was not how I saw it. Now if you think not that -- and this was many conversations as everything important is, if you think that simple or easy, you haven't done it in your own family. Number two is that we can refrain from sharing our thoughts and feelings when appropriate. Who was it that said in a good marriage people get a lot of bite marks in their tongue? Actually it is a special challenge and couple relationships to help people refrain because in couples people feel compelled to tell their partner everything they feel even when corrosive criticism in fighting is a negativity is wearing the relationship down and eroding intimacy and connection. And, of course, any of us can talk a subject to death or focus on the negative in a way that draws us deeper into it when we'd be better off distracting ourselves and going balding. So in the name of truth telling and authenticity in any relationship people can bludge on each other and approach a difficult issue with such a presence of the timing intact that we close down the lines of communication rather than widening the path for truth telling. And part of number two part of refraining is saying it shorter, anybody who gets me as a therapist gets me as an editor and saying it shorter is very difficult because anxiety as we know pushes the polarities so that some people manage emotional intensity by shutting down and convincing themselves it's just not worth it to speak and the other person manage -- usually they are paired up in somewhat. The other person manages emotional intensity by over-talking things. I mean I do that and it's very difficult to modify. And I want to present you a very brief clinical case of a stunning -- I think stunning example of courage illustrates both one and two. The courage to speak and the courage to say it shorter. This is a brief therapy, my client Margo who I first met when she was a high school senior and she was full of talent and energy. She had a huge gift for empathy and compassion and she was also vulnerable to deep depression and she made a suicide attempt during her freshman year of college after her boyfriend broke up with her. So needless to say it was the year from hell for Margo and for her wonderful family who loved her. So when Margo returned home to Topeka after spring break, she visited her favorite teacher from high school who had mentored her and believed in her promise and had meant a great deal to her. So they had some catch-up conversation and as Margo was leaving, the teacher said, "I were so sorry to hear about your suicide attempt Margo. To be frank, I felt very disappointed. I didn't see you as the sort of person who would do such a thing." Now Margo had already suffered mitaly(ph), she was already struggling and -- to -- to keep some side of her competence and her strength and she was totally flattened by shame, by the words of this teacher. And you know how shame just takes the words right out of here now. You know it just takes you back to that place when that you had no words or couldn't speak and -- it makes you want to fold up in a corner and in a dark corner. And in therapy, in her first session with me her -- her shame turned to anger and she decided that she was going to write this teacher a letter and that she was really going to tell him what she thought, which was very brave and she -- I -- I -- you know, when she brought it to me the letter the next session and it was very brave. It was a very long, intense two or three typewritten single space pages of sort of how he had damaged her further and research on suicide and so forth, you know what, the research literature. Now if Margo's intention was simply to let him have it, you know, however she felt it the letter was fine. As I talked to her, she clarified that her intention was to make her teacher understand that he had no right to talk to her that way and she wanted to make him feel bad. Now, of course, we can't make another person feel or understand anything, but given that was her intention, I was very clear with her that this long letter would simply let him off the hook. It would simply -- you know, he would not read it and it would not get in. And, of course, whenever we blame the blamer or shame the shamer, a perfectly natural impulse, but that person will wrap themself more in blankets of denial and rationalization. And I knew that the teacher would not do more than sort of eyeball this very long critique. So I challenged -- you know, I talked with her in the session and she came back, she ended up writing six sentences and she put it on a card, which was also a very good idea and I want to read you her six sentences she wrote. And there were six sentences that he could not so easily disqualify or put aside and here -- that's probably the teacher calling right now. So here is the letter. Dear mister so and so, you've been such an important person in my life. I came back to see you needing your support. It hurt me to be told that I disappointed you as if I'm some kind of failure. I left your office feeling like I was a smaller person who didn't live up to your standards. Maybe that's what you believe, but it didn't help me to hear it. I also need to tell you that I don't believe that I am a lesser person because of my suicide attempt. Love, Margo. Now to the teacher's credit, he actually called her and apologized for his insensitivity and explained that it came out of his anxiety of losing another student, their first year of college the suicide. But his reaction that -- that the teacher rose to the occasion is really not to the point how incredibly brave for a young woman just out of high school recovering from a major depression and the neat loss of her life to talk back to such an important authority. To let him know that she would not accept his invitation to view her vulnerability to depression and her suicide attempt that she would not accept it as shameful or lesser or weak or wrong. So that's an example both of number two of speaking, of saying it shorter. Number three is actually the most important is just calm things down, actually calm yourself. I don't know what I meant by things, several things, but calm yourself down and that's the most important because you really can't do any of the others without this one. And, you know, as therapist we learn to be a calm presence in an anxious emotional field and, you know, we can also learn to do that when, you know, that certain person gets off the plane or were in the same room with that person. And in terms of working as a therapist, I -- I really can't help an adult. I need one key person to get a grip, it just takes one and their intensity and we do know people do better in problem solving when we can operate out of the thinking part of our brain and not out of the limbic system. I could never remember exactly what the limbic system does, but Bessel van der Kolk from Harvard came to Menninger and he gave us this little mnemonic device, if I can remember the mnemonic device for what the limbic system did, because he said that it -- it's in charge of the four Fs, feeding, fighting, fleeing and reproduction. So now -- now -- now I remember and so we all have ways depending on how we work of lowering the reactivity in the office or lowering our own reactivity. And people -- when people really pay attention, you know, they know from what's helped them in the past, what helps them to calm down, the dilemma is one really has to practice it. You know, you can't be like the proverbial man who lies shivering in bed, but is too tired to get up and get a blanket. And -- and obviously there are times when -- when you can't calm down, there are times -- I like Jon Kabat-Zinn's image of the mind, the surface of the mind being like the ocean, the surface of the ocean, it will always be whipped around by weather. You will always -- our clients will always at some point wake up three in the morning with their anxious brains doing the three things that anxious brains do with three in the morning, you know, making to-do lists, nursing old grievances and worrying about future catastrophes, I mean that about covers it. But when one is feeling anxious or intense, it's really not the time to send that long e-mail to your sister or -- I -- I can give you a whole other lecture on e-mail and the ways that it takes -- when people try to process an e-mail, it takes things downhill. Okay, next, number four, that we can clarify the limits of what we can do or give. I mean this again sounds very simple. You know, I -- the generation that I was raised in women learned to feel guilty if we were anything less than an emotional service station to others. And then feminism came along and with it assertiveness training. Although I tell you the truth, this -- really the truth is that people will encourage you to be assertive, but they really only want you to be assertive if they like what you are saying. The message is though, the girls and women have changed a lot, you know, thank goodness, and Ellen Goodman was saying that her -- this is a great example of a good message to give to girls. She said, her best friend has four daughters and says to each of the little girls, speak up, speak up, speak up, speak up, the only person you'll scare off is your future ex-husband. That's great advice, but it's not so simple. You know, we're working with people who in terms of what they should give or do, they are struggling with very complex issues of like whether to bail their child out again financially, how much they can do for an aging or elderly parent. These are not things that are helped by the therapist having an attitude and will just say no. You know, like with drugs just say no. And just very briefly, I mean I'll never forget one woman I saw in therapy that really brings home the fact that therapist need -- you need to know -- you need to know where the person is coming from, to say it most briefly. But I saw a woman named Maria, and after she had a hospitalization at Menninger she was a homemaker with two children, she had just celebrated her 40th birthday. And her husband brought his elderly mother to live in their apartment and his work kept him on the road so that left -- and -- and the larger -- their large Italian-American families had dispersed, so basically leaving Maria as the sole caretaker for her mother who was by the way a piece of work. And she began to absorb more anxiety than she could manage and she complained a lot. You know, she would complain when she was angry and upset and he would come home, but she really believed because it was her culture and her family legacy that she should be able to handle it. So she complained, but she didn't really clarify a bottom line position, saying that she could not do this all by herself. So what happened anyway, her -- her mother did end up in assisted living and -- but this happened only after Maria briefly went into Menninger, because the stress of all this she took a brief foray into some kind of mental illness and I remember what. And during -- I didn't see her till after she went into the hospital. I'll never forget the first thing that she said to me when she came in my office, I think even before she sat down, she said, thank god, the person, the psychiatrist who admitted me to the hospital explained to my husband that I could no longer take care of his mother in the home. I could never have said those words myself. And when you looked at her genogram and also the culture that -- you know, that -- that went back for generations were daughters and especially eldest daughters always took care of elderly parents in the home. You know, she could not say directly, I cannot -- I can no longer do this, okay. So the next, that was number four, number five of bold acts of change is warm things up. I started Marriage Rules with 10 rules on warming things up and it was very difficult for me to do it because it -- it felt at first to me sort of icky, you know, like this women's magazines you read about how to -- you know, and Virginia Woolf said it so long ago how to reflect your man at twice his natural size, as Virginia Woolf put it, but I thought, you know, warming things up, yuck. But actually this is very essential and for many reasons. One being that nobody, I don't care whether there are eight or 80, nobody values criticism if there is not a surrounding climate of love and respect or at least respect, respect. And in couples, many men, for example, welcome constructive criticism in the beginning of the relationship and then the courtship stage or the Velcro stage as I call it or early on, but they tolerate it less well over time. And it's very interesting because when couples first get together, they know automatically how to make the other person usually feel valued and chosen and special and respected. And when they first get together, they automatically pay attention to what they like about the person and they speak to that. So it's very interesting, because it's almost like a law of physics, the longer the relationship, the more enduring the relationship, the more the selective attention flips and the person will automatically notice and pay attention to what they don't like and give voice to that. So -- and it can be a lot of little -- little things like why are you putting so much water in the pasta pot, it's going to boil over and that's not the right knife to cut a tomato, what's -- what's wrong with you. So it actually requires intention and paying attention to speak to the positive and reverse that ratio and I often quote Gottman's five to one ratio, because people like numbers and people like research. And you know, very end I also tell people that God is in the details. I put that in the handout that God is in the details, meaning you know -- you know, it's interesting we know with children that we -- it's not enough to say I love you, I love you, you are such a great kid. We have to speak to the specifics. We need to say, you did a great job setting the table or it was really brave of you to tell your friend that she hurt your feelings. And we forget that adults, whether it's a partner or your mother, whoever, need -- also need the specifics like, I heard you on the phone with your brother last night and it's so amazing how you can get so funny to sort of calm him down, I mean something specific. People tell me there are no specifics. I tell them they've lost perspective and people also will say, I'm not going to do that until he does this. Well, if you want a great recipe for divorce, just wait for the other person to change first. So warming things up, I did -- you know, it's important. The next one, number six, is dial down the defensiveness. I'd become very interested in defensiveness and listening and I mean defensiveness is automatic, it's in the body, it take like a nanosecond if someone says, we have to talk, like it's just right there. It's also the arch enemy of listening and the arch enemy of connection. Now it's easy to listen if we like what the other person is saying, but if for example we are being criticized, we automatically -- we automatically listen for -- for the inaccuracies, the distortions and the exaggerations that will inevitably be there. So we listen for that, so we can correct the person and make our case. And we can help our clients and ourselves learn to listen differently. We can listen only to understand and to validate that piece first. We all know that -- we all know that how we talk and how we listen has a great deal to do with how things go. But most of us are far more interested and invested in the talking part, learning to, you know, talk better than we are in the listening part, which just isn't a very sexy topic. And I remember in terms of talking, my brilliant colleague and friend, Marianne Ault-Riche at Menninger's, actually we took this out into the community. We did these workshops in the community helping people to talk. Marianne developed workshops called Talking Straight and Fighting Fair. She now has a private practice in Palo Alto. So we did these workshops, women were breaking down -- there were women breaking down the doors to get in and I decided once that I would do myself one in the community on listening. And I had to cancel it, let's just say for a lack of registration, we don't even need to hear that numbers here. But it's so important and I -- you know, to digress for a second, Brene Brown -- do you know Brene Brown? She -- yeah, she wrote a couple, actually she became quite famous when her TED talk on vulnerability went viral and she's written the books, two best-selling books, The Gifts of Imperfection and she has a new book, Daring Greatly, which was number one on the New York Times list a while ago. And she did a very sweet thing for me, the paperback of Marriage Rules just is out this minute and because I'm a marketing dinosaur, she sent me a box of like two bazillion bookmarks for Marriage Rules and she put on the back of it though a really great quote that she heard me say during a talk and the quote is, "If we would only listen with the same passion that we feel about wanting to be heard." So, you know, it's -- it's really -- really what I'm saying is, I put a bazillion bookmarks down by my book and I want you to take a bookmark home because what am I going to do like with 20,000 bookmarks, such a sweet gift. I want to share an example -- I want to share an example of tremendous courage -- tremendous courage in listening. Listening with great compassion and openness in the most difficult of circumstances and it was a very moving moment I witnessed between mother and daughter. I was Leddy's therapist, Leddy was the mother and she invited her daughter Kim in for a session with her because Kim's father had died and Kim had been avoiding Leddy and clearly wasn't speaking to her and didn't want to talk about it. When Kim was growing up, her father had been out of control with his sexuality and he had molested her. And Kim's mother, my -- my client Leddy did not know that this was happening and when the facts came out, she responded appropriately, she did all the right things, she got the family in therapy in New York. But when dad -- when the dad died, when Kim's dad died, his death stirred everything up again for his daughter, including an enormous range. So when Kim came in for one session, I asked her -- I basically said something like, how are you doing since your dad's death? And it took about one minute before she launched into a terrible attack on her mother. And although I'm trained, I'm usually -- I usually am a calm presence in an anxious emotional field in my work, I felt my own anxiety rise just with the intensity of this anger that was directed not toward the father who harmed her, but toward her mother, which -- which often happens that -- that the betrayal is located in the relationship between mother and daughter. And I was about to intervene for no other reason than I had offices on each side of me and this was like, you know, very intense attack. I was about to intervene and Leddy pulled her chair over to her daughter and I thought she was going to scream back at her daughter and instead she said in the most fully present way, she said, I am so sorry, Kim. I'm so sorry, I didn't know. I'm so sorry that I didn't protect you and I'm so sorry that this terrible thing happened in our family and she began to cry and then her daughter began to cry and put her arms around her. Now I don't know how Leddy was able to be there for her daughter in such a remarkably open and non-defensive way. She didn't say she was sorry because she thought it was her fault that this happened, but now in the midst of being totally blasted, she moved to a place of pure listening and -- and just offered her love and her apology for being part of this painful history was genuine and heartfelt and was the beginning then of a process of healing. And Leddy's apology was especially useful in beginning the healing process because it didn't include any postscripts. She didn't say I'm sorry, but you need to keep in mind that I didn't know it was happening or I'm sorry, but your dad was a really weak man. Or I'm sorry, but now that we've talked about it again, I certainly hope we can put this behind us and move on. She didn't even say I'm sorry and I hope you'll forgive me. Of course, Leddy hopes that Kim will forgive her, but a real apology does not ask the other person to do anything, not even to forgive. What's really important here is that the mother's work, Leddy's work was not done when that session was over, it just began because when there's been trauma or a person has been harmed or betrayed, nothing is healed in one conversation or by saying, I'm sorry. So I coached Leddy to take the initiative to open up conversations with her daughter after this session to let her daughter know that she still always thought about what had happened, that she had never forgotten that she still felt pain over it. And she said, she was so sorry that she had never brought it up after all these decades, because her intention -- her thought was, well, if I bring it up and she's not bringing it up, I'm just going to cause more pain and she said to her daughter, I realize now what I did through my silence is I left you totally alone with this. I refer you to the brilliant work of Janis Abrahms Spring, who I've learned so much from in terms of not just leaving it to the harmed party to -- to -- to bring things up. And her books After the Affair, her books on forgiveness, her concept of the transfer, what is it, the transfer of justice. I can't -- I can't remember what it's called, but it's very, very important. So the next one, number seven, is overcome your LDD. This is also about listening. LDD is the new diagnostic category I'm trying to get into the DSM, Listening Deficit Disorder. Really -- I really do want to see it in the DSM. You know and again it has to do with listening where I have two homework assignments that are really very useful. One, I call, I challenge people to do the ultimate listening experiment, where they take the initiative to invite the very conversation they'd read. That is in your handouts in rule number 25, an example of that in my own marriage. And people are very resistant to that idea. They say, you know, I'm not going to invite her when she is already over-talking and obsessed. I'm not going to invite her to tell me everything about her worry about little Billy. And, you know, I explain it's not useful to muscle a person, they will only feel more intense and more obsessed. And then the other very useful assignment I give people around listening in overcoming their LDD is to think of doing the two step, to think in terms of two conversations where in the first conversation, you will only listen to understand. That is all you're going to do and to ask questions and to say, is there more you haven't told me. And then you have another conversation where you speak to the differences, as in I've been thinking a lot about our conversation. I really agree with you that I ignored you at the party and I'm sorry about that, but as I think about it, I don't agree that I'm responsible for your over-drinking. I'm responsible for my behavior, but I'm not responsible for your behavior in managing my bad behavior. So one needs to do both, the number two, you know, sometimes I find harder for men who -- and couples tend to be much more conflict avoidant. And they manage emotional, this is just a generalization, obviously. But women are more likely to move into the fray when they are feeling intense and men are more likely to distance. And there is a very popular joke, it's actually international, not just in this country that maintains, the joke maintains that the husband should always have the last word and that last word should be, you're right honey, I'm wrong, I'm really sorry and I'll never do it again. That's not good enough, it's just not good enough. So number two, first conversation you only listen, but you also have to, in conversation number two, speak. The next, let's see, number eight on our 10 points is to become a good questioner. And, of course, we learn this as therapists. You know, the more experienced I am as a therapist, the more I'm a better questioner. And when Isidor Rabi, who was a Nobel laureate in physics, he was once asked, what motivated him to be a scientist? And he credited his Jewish mother from Brooklyn. He explained that all the other mothers would ask their children after school that they had learned something, but his mother always asked something else. Isi, she would say, did you ask a question -- a good question today? That difference he said, asking good questions made me a scientist. And it also I think makes us good therapists, however we work. So I coach clients to stay curious and become very creative questioners with their family as they're filling out a genogram, it's interesting how parents and other family members can be surprisingly forthcoming with information if they know that it's going to be helpful if they're approached with genuine curiosity and respect and they know they're not going to be criticized, blamed, diagnosed and the questioner doesn't overload the circuits and doesn't act like a lawyer even if they are one. Okay, number nine and 10, and I'm going to go through these together, because I pay a lot of attention to read your feedback and I realize a lot of people have the problem that they get nine and not 10 or 10 and not nine. It's better to get one than neither, but it's actually -- I'll explain why very important to get them both. And number nine is respect differences and number 10 is to find a bottom line. In terms of respecting differences, I always help people like nub about differences. We all see the role through a different filter, you know, through the filter of your birth order and gender and generation and, you know, race and culture and unique family history and how the gene pool falls and the moon and stars and grace and everything else. And differences, of course, don't mean one person is right and one person is wrong. And we know that humans have a terrible time with differences. I have a -- in my consulting room in Lawrence, Kansas, I have a great cartoon that my humorist friend, Jennifer Berman drew, created and it shows a dog and a cat in bed together. And the dog is looking morose and reading a book called "Dogs who Love too Much." And the cat is saying, "I'm not distancing damn it! I'm a cat!" Now here is the problem, here is the problem and why we need number 10 about defining a bottom line is that what I noticed is that, you know, appreciating differences or respecting differences or tolerating differences can turn into this sort of Mars, Venus stuff where 1% doesn't expect enough from their partner. They don't reach enough for the other person's competence to do better and insist on it, you know, and they begin to make excuses for the other person based on this notion of differences like, you know, he can't vacuum the rug, his penis will get in the way. I exaggerate, but really just a little bit, you know. So, you know, I write in all of my books from the Dance of Anger and especially in Marriage Rules, it's very complex to define a bottom line position and it's so curial and it's a challenge in all relationships and very simply a bottom -- but it's not simple, a bottom line position is that place where your core value -- core values, beliefs and priorities are not negotiable under relationship pressures. A bottom line position evolves from a deeply felt in the body knowledge of what a person feels entitled to in a relationship and the limits of their tolerance. And there is no one bottom line that fits all, but if a person has no bottom line or you set the bar too low, relationships will spiral downwards. And a bottom line does not need, you know, it can be about a very serious issue, a bottom line position can be -- well, for example, one woman I was working with, whose husband was in treatment for a long time for sex addiction, which they labeled as a disease and she was studying up on it and, you know, this was his disease. And something shifted and she had a bottom line position for the first time in a long time and she basically said to him and she said it at a calm time when she was actually liking him, which is important because a bottom line position will turn into a sort of angry ultimatum, if you do it when you're angry. At a calm time she said, you know, I don't care if we call it sex addiction or we call it sauerkraut. And I don't care what caused it or what's happened is that I'm now in a place in this marriage where if there is one more event that I cannot stay, I will not stay and I need you to know this because I can't -- I can no longer stay and feel good about myself and you and the marriage. And I also coached her to put it in a card to write it, because she had been complaining and saying this in anger for so long, you have to change the venue or change the medium or -- Bill O'Hanlon talks about this and has many brilliant books also. But it's not, you know, a bottom line position, it -- it's also there in the dailyness of living where you might say to someone, look, if you keep talking to me in your debate mode, I'm not going to be in the conversation. You know, bring this up another time when you can approach me with respect. That's a bottom line position. It's not a bottom line position if you say, I can continue if you talk to me in this way and then you continue or you sit there crying or, you know, pleading or whatever, but it's a bottom line position when your actions are congruent. So in conclusion, you know, what we call the self, of course, is never static, it's always under construction. We can always work on it and through the quality of our words and listening, we can create a far more accurate and enhancing view of ourself and the other person and the possibilities between us. And it's a tall order, I mean these very simple sounding 10 things are the challenge of a lifetime. Or since we're in California, I'll say they're the challenge of many lifetimes perhaps, but like all things worth doing, it's a matter of motivation, courage, goodwill, a genuine wish for a better relationship and the willingness to practice, practice and practice. So thank you very much.
