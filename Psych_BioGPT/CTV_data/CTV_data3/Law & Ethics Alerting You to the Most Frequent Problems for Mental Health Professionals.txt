Law & Ethics: Alerting You to the Most Frequent Problems for Mental Health Professionals

Steven Frankel, Ph.D., J.D. 

00:00:15
STEVEN FRANKEL Well, good morning. Nice to see you. Nice to be here. Ah, and for the two of you who really wanted to spend six hours of your life doing this, let me extend a very warm to you. This is a four or six, depending on what your schedule is today, ah, hour program in law and ethics that, ah, is designed to qualify for your license renewal. And every year--every two years-- I have to change the program and I am now in the, in the mode of getting ready for the next two years. This is the last rendition of this program. So if you were here a year ago, ah, you're going to be exposed to much the same stuff. If you come to the couples conference, ah, next year, it'll be all different. And every two years, it's a crisis for me. It's a, it's really a crisis because the speed of change in the world of law, ethics and regulation is, shall we say, glacial. Ah, and trying to figure out what new stuff I can talk about is a nightmare. It's just a nightmare because there's not noth--how many, how many Tarasoff cases are there anyway. So it's, it's a big problem every two years and I'm in it now. I've decided on the title of the next two-year program. It's doing to be Dancing With the Risks. We're going to start with fox trot, slow, quick, quick, slow, quick. And which is a safe, very safe dance. And we're going to talk about tangos, which can be very tricky. And, ah, then we're going to talk about the funky chicken, which may be very not so good. Uhm, but for now, I'm getting--going to do for the next four hours this morning and then two hours this afternoon, ah, the program that I developed for this, for this two years, Law and Ethics Greatest Hits because what I decided to do is rather than sample from the universe of things I could talk about, I would start by looking at what we get in trouble for, what is it that gets us into, into trouble. And I, I figured it out. I have data for you from a variety of states, including Arizona, ah, including California, including Oregon, including Missouri, ah, of all places, because I did one of these there. And you'll see that the, the data about what we get in trouble for are remarkably consistent state to state to state, nationwide, and over time, very, very consistent. So, so that's what I'm going to talk about is what we get in trouble for and how to pay attention to not getting into trouble for those things. Ah, for those--how many of you have not been one of these with me before? Okay, great. The rest of you can take a nap for a minute while I introduce myself to those of you who've not been to one of these with me. Ah, I'm a Ph.D. in clinical psychology of Indiana University in 1968, which tells you I've been around for a while. I would like to say I was fourteen at the time, but I wasn't. Uhm, and, ah, if you resonate to that kind of psychology training, I was trained in a tradition known as Midwestern industrial empiricism. The, the hallmark--oh, kindred spirits--ah, the hallmark axiom of which is that I was trained as, as some of you may have been, ah, to, to refuse to offer an opinions about matters psychological absent data. If there were no data, you weren't allowed to speak. Uhm, that, of course, is a direct contrast to my legal training.

STEVEN FRANKEL After three years in Bloomington, Indiana--well, I should tell you I'm from New England. I grew up in Connecticut and Vermont. And, and going in 1964 to Bloomington, Indiana was like going to South Pluto and, and Pluto isn't even a planet anymore. Uhm, I, I don't mean anything offensive to those of you who may be Hoosiers, it just wasn't a good place for me. I was--in fact, I was so unhappy there, that I finished all my doctoral requirements including my dissertation in three years and I fled, a fairly tightly wrapped cognitive psychologist, ah, because we didn't have cognitive behavioral at that point in time. And I, I fled to New York and entered into Columbia where I played with psychoanalysts for a year. Uhm, and I had the real thing. I had, I had analytic supervisors who had hyphenated Austrian names . And so they loosened me up real good. Ah, and then I fled to California, ah, and I joined the faculty at U.S.C. and taught there in the psych department for 12 years and then I had to make a living so I, so I, I devoted myself to clinical practice. And I practiced to this day--actually, not this day, yesterday. Ah, I had to shift my patients around in order to fly here yesterday. But I practiced psychology on Wednesdays. So I go into a phone booth and I come out a psychologist and I spend the day seeing, ah, eight patients. My patients are now after 30 couple years, I started this particular kind of work in 1980, knowingly. Ah, I work with adults who claim child abuse histories, that's my population. So I'm basically--I'm a trauma therapist. And that's who I work with, that's who I see and I see eight of them, eight folks a week and, uhm, the rest of the week, I practice law or I teach and that's all you need to know. Uhm, where am I slidewise? This is risk management and, and I love and detest it not because it isn't interesting. I think what you'll find out is that it is--there's some really interesting stuff we're going to talk about. What I hate about it is that it's toxic. Ah, it's going, it scares the bejesus out of everybody because it's, it's all about things that we get in trouble for and the terrible things that can happen to us. So let me see if I can inoculate you against the heebie-jeebies, ah, a little bit. And, and the best ways I can do begin with this, begin with some information. In the world of learned professions, we mental health professionals, especially the nonphysicans among us, are blessed. We are the least persecuted, the least prosecuted, the least pursued, the least attacked of any of the learned professions. Ah, let me, let me support that with some data. Ah, the Indiana tradition lives with me--within me. You can, you can take the boy out of Indiana but you can't take Indiana out of the boy. Uhm, I'll give you some California data. In California, there are--well, let me, let me start with, with malpractice insurance. Maybe that's better. Uhm, I, I, I've been in clinical practice since 19--I've been licensed in California since 1970. I work with a very high risk population. Childhood trauma survivors are very high risk. They are involved in a lot of litigation against therapists. And, uhm, I, I have the blessings of the force and I have not been sued or, or reported to a licensing board in these, these years. Ah, but I carry as much mental health malpractice insurance as I can and I pay about $1,000 a year for that mental health malpractice insurance. Ah, I'm in my fifteenth year of law practice. I work with a relatively non-risky population. I work with us. We're not litigious and nasty, most of us aren't anyway. Uhm, and, uhm, I've not had anything happen with me like a lawsuit or a, a bar association complaint, again thank the force. And I carry as much legal malpractice insurance as I can. And I also pay $1,000 for it. But I pay $1,000 every month not every year. That should tell you two things. It should tell you that therapists get sued a lot less than lawyers do. Lawyers get sued a lot more than mental health professionals do. And it should also tell you that the insurance industry which pays the bills for a malpractice suit if you lose, the mal--the insurance industry views us as very low risks because they don't have to pay a lot of money. When a lawyer screws up, the, the lawyers insurance company pays a lot of money. When a mental health professional screws up, it's not anywhere near that much. It's between $30,000 and $80,000. When a lawyer screws up, it's in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, easily. Uhm, if it's a psychiatrist that has medications, it goes to lot of money. So physicians pay--my wife is a child analyst and psychiatrist. Uhm, I don't, I don't even ask her what she pays for malpractice insurance every year because it's way more than I do. Ah, because medications can really do some damage. So just in terms of malpractice insurance premiums, you can tell that nonphysician mental health professionals are really a very protected class. Ah, if you're in California, you, you're even more protected and those of you who are not Californians listen up. If you're connected to your professional society's, ah, government relations committee, the marketing group of your professional society, in California, we had a, a-- we lost many, many physicians during the 1970's because lawyers were suing their pants off. And they were not able to pay their ins--their malpractice insurance premiums. I knew, I knew, ah, anesthesiologists and, uhm, OBGYNs who in the 1970's were paying $10,000 a month for their malpractice insurance premiums. In, in 1970's dollars. It was an enormous amount of burden to them. And they were fleeing California. Uhm, what happened was that all the healthcare professions went to the state legislature and said you've got to fix this problem. And this, the legislature stepped up and did two things to protect healthcare people. The first is they put in the shortest statute of limitations on record and I'll talk to you about that when we get there this afternoon. And the second thing that they did was they put a cap on emotional damages. No matter what a healthcare practitioner does in California to, to harm a patient, the most the patient can collect is a quarter of a million dollars. And the attorney can only get a third of that. And that's about $85,000. When a mental health professional screws up and does damages, it's usually emotional damages. No lawyer in California wants to sue somebody for $80,000--$85,000. It's not enough money. So Californian therapists are really protected because lawyers don't want to sue them. They just don't want to work for $85,000. It's too much, too much work for too little money. Uhm, so that's the story with malpractice premiums and, and the policies. I'll give you one more data point. In California, there are currently over 70,000 nonphysician therapists that are licensed. Ah, there are about 22,000 psychologists. There are about 15,000, 18,000 LCSWs, ah, and the rest are MFTs. We are now having professional counselors coming in, ah, for the first time so I don't know how many of those we've, we've got. So there are around 72,000 nonphysician therapists in California right now. That's the target population for, uhm, a board action. For a licensing board action, I can tell you that there are about 2,000 complaints to the licensing boards in California every year and of those, there are about 800 investigations and of those, there are about 40 to 60 colleagues who get harmed by their licensing boards. You don't have to be a probability theory freak to know that 40 to 60 hits out of 70 some odd thousand targets are great odds. And California therapists can go to sleep every night feeling safe. And it's the same in all the states. The, the board actions are lethal and horrible and all that, but they're relatively rare. And I'll show you some data about that. Uhm, so, I wanted to give you some information that would quell some of your anxiety. And the rest of what I'll do to quell your anxiety is to sort of forget about you and entertain myself. And if I can do that, then we all get through this a lot easier. That doesn't mean I won't attend to your questions. If you have questions, go to the mic because we're recording and broadcasting. And so you're doing to need to go to the mic and stand there and I'll, I'll say yes and you'll ask a question and then they'll record it. Okay, uhm, as Jeff told you, I have provided all the slides and all that stuff to him and to the foundation for handouts so you'll be able to access all the stuff I'm going to show you today, ah, by going to their website. We're going to go until about a quarter to 10. We're going to take a 15 minute break. We'll come in--we'll come back at 10:00 and we'll go til noon and then we'll break and then we have lunch and those of you who need six hours or really love this stuff, come back, come back at 1:15 and we'll do two hours then. Uhm, couple of suggestions. You can ask me questions anytime you want. There's the mic. Just come on up and, and ask and I'll try to answer the best I can. Ah, you're welcome to come up at breaks but you should know that the only part of me that asks my age is my prostate gland and--it's always the women who laugh. It's always the women who laugh. Uhm, and so you want to come up and talk to me at a break, ah, count to eight. If I'm still here, come on up. Otherwise, wait a minute, I'll be right back. Ah, when we're done this afternoon at, at, ah, at 3:00, uhm, try not to ask me questions because every time you cover a topic, the convulsions in my brain deepen so that by the time we're done after six hours of this stuff, I suffer from acute convulsional melancholia and, ah, I'll, I, I--but I'm basically a nice guy with a law degree. And I'll answer any question you may ask. I have no idea where the answer will come from though. And I wouldn't trust anything I tell you after 4:00 or 3:00. The, the last thing I'll, I'll tell you, you've probably already figured out. I've been around for a long time and during the years of my, my full-time practice in psychology, I was also doing inpatient work in a private psychiatric hospital. And so the word, word that comes out of my mouth when I talk about consumers of mental health services is patients. Uhm, I don't mean it in a pejorative way. If I'm in therapy, a patient doesn't bother me at all. But it's handy for me because the word that I use to describe consumers of legal services is clients. So you'll know who I'm talking about by which of those words I use. You can use any word you want. I can translate. Uhm, okay. So that's that. When we get the slide back up, I will move on. Hello. Here you are. One of the few fun things about doing a, a slide show for a program on law and ethics is finding funny quotes, ah, or poignant quotes or remarkable quotes. This is a George Orwell quote. "On the whole human beings want to be good, but not too good, and not all the time." Ah, these are data on lawsuits against mental health professionals. These are 1989 data on frequency of lawsuits against mental health professionals that Ken Pope published. Ken Pope is a very senior behaviorist--behavioral ethicist who used to live in California and now lives in Connecticut. And, uhm, why am I showing you 1989 data? Well, it isn't because they're the same as they are now. They aren't. Things have changed and I'll you what's different. But what, ah, I, I'm stuck with and you're stuck with is 1989 data because you can't get newer data because the data are controlled by the insurance industry. And the insurance industry is not interested in advertising how much it makes. And it makes an enormous amount of money. So it doesn't release the data on malpractice suits. Ah, further, the vast majority of malpractice suits are, are resolved in private mediation and arbitration sessions and those are required for the parties to commit to not talking about them. So the data are not available. Since I live with one foot in that world, I'll tell you what's different from 1989 but, ah, these are the newest data I could get, sorry. So in 1989, 20% of the cases against therapists were, were sex cases. Ah, they're still up in that range. They're still up in that range. You'll see when I start to look to show you data from the licensing boards across the nation, you'll see that the number of us who have sex with patients is unbelievably consistent year after year and year after year, roughly the same number of us have sex with patients. And since licensing boards take our licenses if we have sex with patients, it's, it's the same number of us, different ones of us, each year. It's, it's quite, quite remarkable. Uhm, in 1989, incompetence with the second most frequent lawsuit category. It is still one of the top four categories. Incompetence basically means you think you know what you're doing, you don't. You hurt somebody. They sue you. Uhm, confidentiality was--now we go into the lower level ones--confidentiality was not big in 1989 data. It's not big now for lawsuits. It's big for law--for licensing board complaints. And let me see if I can explain why that is. Uhm, if you want to file a lawsuit against somebody, you have to show that you were harmed and that harm has to be translatable into money, how much money you should be paid because you were harmed. Breaching somebody's confidentiality to the tune of just letting people know that they're your patient doesn't typically harm them very much. Most everybody's in therapy these days every once in a while in their lives and it's not all that shameful. If you breach their confidentiality with some really powerful thing that hurts them, and, and they are damaged by it, you tell some horrifying secret about them and it gets out, that's worth suing in, in, in a malpractice suit. But by and large, there's not enough money in a malpractice suit for beaches of confidentiality that are pretty trivial to sue somebody. Licensing boards, however, don't require harm. They require a violation of the standard of practice, the standard of care. And so if we do something wrong, it doesn't matter whether we hurt somebody or not. All that matters is we did something wrong and the licensing board can take your license for that. So confidentiality issues aren't big for malpractice but they are big for licensing board actions. Ah, then comes fee collection. It wasn't big then. It isn't big now. Most of us have learned that, that when people stop paying, we stop treating and we make that clear in our informed consent. Ah, and we stand, stand by it. We don't, we, we, don't anymore--I hope we don't--ah, use collection agencies and stuff like that. Those trigger enormously aggressive nasty, ah, complaints and activities from patients. So we don't have much prob--problems with, with fee collection at this point in time. Suicide was not a big deal then. It, it's a big deal when, when people commit suicide or attempt to harm themselves. There, there are a lot more suits now than there were then. Uhm, the families get litigious. Ah, the patient if, if they survive and they don't feel protected by us, gets litigious. Uhm, many states, many, many states have something that's called the apology statute. Uhm, I have a log of how--which states have, have those and if your state has an apology statute, it means that you are free to say how sad you are about something that's happened to a patient or to the family of a patient without admitting guilt and liability and responsibility. And it's the data, there's been research on the apology statutes, and the data are really clear that if we express our, our sadness, our, our regret, our, our feelings of empa--empathically connected to the patient or to the patient's family that's upset with us, the probability of legal action against us drops statistically significantly. They want to hear that we feel bad about it. But we don't have to say we did it. We can't say--we can't--if you--the statute won't work if you say, my bad. I screwed up. Doesn't work. It only works if you say I feel your--some version of I feel your pain. I share your pain. Uhm, so suicide is still around. It's a little bit higher than 5.8% now. Wrongful failure to diagnose is not a big issue except for two categories of patient populations. One is if you work with really little kids. If you work with really, really young children, the, the forms of psychopathology in young children aren't always consistent with DSM and, and so sometimes, psychopathology in children, you know it's there but you're not quite exactly sure what it is. And so there are wrongful diagnoses and failure to diagnose problems with people who work with small children. Ah, the other population are borderlines. Ah, there are two cases in California that didn't go very far. But there were two different borderline personality disordered patients who sued their thera--first therapist, uhm, you have to know borderlines to get the joke on that. Ah, they sued their first therapist for not telling them that they had borderline personality disorder. They had a, they had a predictable falling out with their first therapist, went to a new therapist, who said you have borderline personality disorder and here's what it--what it means. And they said--they turned around and sued their former therapist for not telling them that. Didn't, didn't work. Uhm, custody was 2.2% in the 1989 data. It is now one of the top four. If you work with people involved in high conflict custody cases, you're working with a potentially lethal population. And this is a very risky-- we're going to talk about this, this work later today, uhm, because it is so frequently involved in legal stuff. Ah, so that's jumped way up, ah, custody. Custody evaluators are protected. They're immune from lawsuits. They're not immune from licensing board complaints. But treating clinicians are really exposed and have problems. Ah, dual relationships was .6%. It's now one of the top four. Uhm, and this excludes sex. There's a separate category for sex. Sex is, of course, a dual relationship. But dual relationships in general turn out to be now one of the top four. So what'd we got for the top four? We've got sex. We've got competence. We've got, uhm, custody. We've got dual relationships. Those are the top four now. They weren't then but they are now. Now look. Let's have a talk. I'll fix you at the break. Uhm, failure to warn is not a big deal. Most of us know what we're supposed to do in our states about that. Abandonment is not a big deal unless you work with, ah, with borderlines then it becomes a risk. Failure to refer is not a, is not a big deal at this point. So that's, that's what's now. That's what's going on now with lawsuits. These are board actions and, ah, this is California and this is-- these are the master degree therapists in California. So these are LCSWs, MFTs, ah, and there are going to be counselors, will be here. And the, the most frequently occurring one is personal conduct, ah, 45 cases over the, over the bunch of years. Personal conduct means one of two kinds of things. It means that you are having a dual relationship with somebody, a boundary, a boundary issue. And the other personal conduct issue is covered here is if you get arrested for a crime, uhm, and convicted of a crime. Any crim--criminal conviction. And if it's substantially related to your functioning as a mental health professional, it, it goes here. Uhm, what is the most frequent crime that we commit? DUI, driving under the influence. It is the most frequently occurring crime that mental health professionals get caught in each year. And the second, ah, I can tell you, I've, I've seen--I've represented five clinicians over the past 14 plus years who have shoplifted. Uhm, I don't know. I have no idea. I, ah, the only one where I have an idea is one. Ah, she took Ambien and she'd never done anything like this before in her life. Under Ambien's influence, she shoplifted twice. And it, it is so well-known in the legal community that Ambien can produce a variety of antisocial behaviors that the deputy attorney general who prosecuted her for the state board was willing to have us go forward with, with dispensing justice with her without me even producing an expert to tell the court how much damage Ambien can cause because they deputy attorney general knew that Ambien causes damage like that. So shoplifting. So that's what personal conduct is. It's, it's boundary issues and it's, ah, conviction of a crime. And it's getting worse year after year. I know what the problem is. I'm not getting any kind of power. 

00:24:10
[sil.] 

00:24:15
STEVEN FRANKEL Let's try that. Nope. At a break, we'll have to figure this out cuz I'm not getting any power to my computer. That's why it's shutting down so much. Uhm, all right. So that's personal conduct. And then it goes from 45 to 34, which is competence. That's you think you know what you're doing and you're not, and you don't and somebody gets hurt. And then it drops to sex and look at the consistency of sex. It's, it's an amazing--careful--it's--you can't talk about sex without many entendres, right. Uhm, it's very consistent and you'll see it again in the other data. Ah, after sex, unprofessional conduct means--it's legal language. Unprofessional conduct means you, you did something that your licensing board's law says you shouldn't do. You, you violated a licensing board regulation. That's called unprofessional conduct and then it drops to fraud. Uhm, it--fraud doesn't happen very often but when it happens, the licensing boards go ballistic. And let me see if I can explain why that is. Uhm, licensing boards are created specifically with the mission to protect the public from being harmed by the regulated community. That's--we are the regulated community. And, and boards exist to protect the public from being harmed by us. If a licensing board believes that one of us has committed some sort of fraud and fraud, the definition varies from state to state, but if the, if the board believes we are--we have committed fraud--and fraud includes things like upcoding on insurance bills, ah, ah, ah, using a wrong diagnosis to be nice to somebody. Ah, ah, a variety of different kinds of things like that. Saying, saying something didn't happen on a, on a--here's, here's a common one: saying that you had no history of arrest when the board knows you did when you're fil-- when you're filing your renewal on your, on your licensure thing, that kind of that. That's called fraud. And the reason that the boards go nuts is because they believe that someone of us who commits fraud is likely to have a character flaw, have a character logic problems, a personality disordered kind of problem. And the boards believe that if one of us has a character flaw, we are a great danger to the public. And so they will act with hobnail boots, jumping up and down on us, if they believe we have committed fraud because it's assigned to them that we have a character logic problem and that's something that's very, very not okay with them. 

00:26:45

00:26:50
STEVEN FRANKEL It would be nice if I had a quick fix but I don't. The cords disappear. Uhm, okay, so, so that's fraud. Uhm, I'll tell you, I'll tell you a horrifying fraud story. In California, you can be guilty of fraud without having intent to deceive. In most sta--in many states you have to intend to deceive somebody in order to be convicted of fraud. But out in California, you just have to say something isn't true when it is true or say it isn't, is true when it isn't true. Uhm, in California, last year in 2010, 150 candidates for the licensing examination in psychology were denied the right to take the examination because their supervisors had filled out a form--you know when you start to supervise a student, you have to fill out a form that says today we began our supervision and we--and then you log hours and then the student takes that and submits it to the board and if they have the right number of hours, they get passed on to take the exam. Well in 2010, what happened was the board got 150 student applications that included a document signed by their supervisor that dated when they began their supervision experience but the form itself was not created at the time that the supervisor says they signed it. What happened was we, we're not noted to be real obsessive-compulsive kinds of folks most of us, you know. And so we don't look at these things really carefully. So what happened was the supervisors obviously misplaced the form and they went to the board's website, downloaded the form and didn't realize that it was a new form that form--that the board had, had modified it, updated it and had the new updating date on it, you know. But the supervisors didn't noticed that. They downloaded the form. They signed it and they dated it the date that they actually began to do the supervision which could be 1,500 hours ago, or 3,000 hours ago. And they submitted it and the board said fraud. And they denied every one of those 150 students the right to take the examination because their credentials were fraudulent. And they wrote letters to every supervisor who did that and they said this is fraud. You do this one more time and we take your license. Signed, your friendly licensing board. Uhm, so that's, that's how, that's how aggressive they get when it comes to fraud. It's, it's very, very aggressive. Uhm, okay, so that's fraud and then unlicensed activities, so people who are practicing without a license. Probation violations, I have no idea what other means, ah, whatever. Oh, I forgot health and safety. Health and safety, four cases. Uhm, health and safety is stuff like, ah, why don't you get up--I'm a cognitive behavioral therapist doing cognitive behavior therapy with a depressed patient who sleeps very late and then gets up and is in a behavioral energy sink, losing energy every day. And I say go to the gym and work out and get up early, that'll help you feel better. And they go to the gym and they have a heart attack because I didn't give them the right instruction. The instruction is go to your physician, get an evaluation, get, get a coach, you know, then go and get a pran--a play, a program, whatever. All right. So this is the California board--this is the, ah, California Board of Psychology and you can see that we got the same kind of configuration except they use some different categories. Ah, personal conduct is dual relationships, ah, and, uhm, and they separate that out from criminal conviction. So those are tied for first place. Ah, then it goes to unprofessional conduct, which is violating any board issue. Don't worry about the fact that the numbers don't seem to add up. They fell off the page as I was creating the slide. Uhm, unprofessional conduct and it drops down to sex, 13 cases of sex again. Look at the consistency, with the exception of, ah, 2009. It, it--that was some kind of year for sex. But, uhm, otherwise it's very, very consistent. Ah, and after sex, it's other state board, you come into California with another state board action and you have a problem and so on. So these are the, the psychology data. Ah, this is Arizona. And this is the Board of Psychologists--the Board of Psychologists Examiners. At the time, I took--gathered these data, there were about 1,500 active psychologists in Conn--in Arizona. Ah, unprofessional conduct is breaking any rule of your board and there were 19 cases, record problems, custody evaluation problems and other state licensing problems, criminal conviction, those are DUIs. No sex. Congratulations Arizona psychologists. This is the Arizona Board of Behavioral Health Examiners. There are about 8,300 licensees back in 2009 and unprofessional conduct is the champion. That's breaking any rule that your board has for you and it's increasing. Ah, fraud is right up there. Ah, chemical dependency, a specific category for, for therapists who have chemical dependency problems. Uhm, crimes, 38 cases of crimes. Those are all--almost all DUIs. Ah, sex, 26 cases among the, the, the masters level people. Uhm, mental illness, they have a category for mental illness. California Psychology does too. So I'll tell you a mental illness story. Ah, boards can come after us for, for, quote, mental illness. Uhm, I was sent a guy by a psychologist who practices in San Francisco for a legal consultation. The, the patient was in his late thirties, early forties. His parents were from India. He, he was born here. He was into yoga and, and that kind of stuff for a living. His marriage blew out and he got really bent out of shape about it. He went to see a woman, a psychologist in San Francisco who was born in Vietnam, ah, came out during the Vietnam conflagration but apparently her family didn't make it out. She came here, studied, became a psychologist, went to practice and operated with a sort of eastern sort of orientation to the world and which fit this guy's orientation. And they worked together for three years on what was going on with him and women. And things went really well. He felt really good about the work she did with him. He felt understood. He felt cared about. It was a good connection. And then she began to get really weird. Ah, she began to say things to him like I'm communicating about you with the source. And then she began to bill him for communicating about him with the source. And, and then she told him that he was Satan possessed and that he as Satan was responsible for the deaths of her family members. Ah, she told him that she had another patient who was Satan possessed and they had, they had to meet each other. And then she had a patient who was angel possessed and they had to meet each other too. And he had all three of them writing purging documents. I don't know why the angel possessed one would want to purge the angel from her but what'd I know. Ah, and this went on for a period of about three months and got crazier and crazier and finally he said, you're crazy and I'm not and I'm leaving. And he goes and he leaves and he goes to a new therapist who says yeah, she was crazy. And he, he comes to me and I--all three of them come to me, and, uhm, they decide to file a lawsuit and report her to the licensing board. During the pendency of the lawsuit and the licensing board investigation, she died, the therapist died. To this day, we don't know of what. I've not seen a death certificate, but the speculation is either suicide from profound shame or a brain tumor or something like that. This lady became increasingly psychotic o--over time. Uhm, when a board learns that somebody is really crazy, they step in and they'll take the license, require them to get into therapy and get evaluations and stuff like that. That's, that's common. Uhm, okay. This is the number of people in different categories in Arizona, which is not important for us now. This is Missouri. Uhm, these are psychologists, 1,800 plus active licenses. Ah, boundary violations which include sex are there. Ah, crimes, same thing, DUIs. Unprofessional conduct, breaking a rule. Incompetence, probation violation and supervision problems. This is for social workers. There are 5,100--5,100 active licenses and 56 board actions, about 2% a year. You should pay attention to what I'm about to tell you. I'll get you in a second. Uhm, in many states because of the economy, the legislature is passing statutes that authorize licensing boards to act against someone's license if they haven't paid their state income tax. And the theory is if we're licensing you with a state license for you to make a living and you don't pay your state taxes, we're going to yank your license. You're committing a crime against the state. And it turns out that 17 of these actions were for failure to, to pay their state income tax. Sir? 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN I understand that, uhm, in California there's a physician psychiatrist head of the prison system that has been, uhm, denied practice because of--considered incompetent and he's getting paid like half a million dollars a year. Uhm, even though he hasn't any clients or patients for two or three years. And he's, I think he's like the psychiatrist for the prison system. 

00:36:15
STEVEN FRANKEL That, that may be. I, I frankly don't know. Uhm, I wouldn't be surprised. The, the quality of healthcare in general in a prison system is, is rancid. And, and highly problematic. Uhm, the prison system used to be a refuge for professionals who had lost their licenses, especially the federal prisons, ah, because you didn't need a state license to practice in a federal prison. And there's been--there's an effort underway to, to, to, to change all that. And I don't know this guy in particular and, ah, so I can't comment on, on, on what you're saying is true. But I know that the system has problems. 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN It, it seemed like that it'd been going on for several years. Uhm . . . 

00:37:00
STEVEN FRANKEL I've heard rumors to that effect. 

00:37:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:37:00
STEVEN FRANKEL I just haven't looked into it. 

00:37:00
UNKNOWN Just wondering about the--how long it takes a board to actually do something. 

00:37:05
STEVEN FRANKEL Ah, it can take a long time, especially now because the economy is in such bad shape--and this is true for a lot of states--the economy is in such bad shape that, ah, a lot of the investigators are overwhelmed with cases and, and they're understaffed and the board staff have to take furloughs. Ah, they don't work five days a week every week. It, it's a big mess. So it can take years. In most states, there's a statute of limitations on how, how soon a board has to act once a complaint is made. In California, it's three years. Uhm, if, if a board is informed that someone did something wrong or believed to do something wrong, they have three years to take action. And if they don't take action in three years, they lose the--they can't bring the case. And there have been several cases that have been lost that way. 

00:37:45
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:37:45
STEVEN FRANKEL Sir? 

00:37:50
UNKNOWN I'm on one of those Missouri boards. 

00:37:50
STEVEN FRANKEL Uh-huh. 

00:37:50
UNKNOWN And it's not that we are going after but when you renew your license that's when it kicks in. 

00:37:50
STEVEN FRANKEL Yeah. 

00:37:50
UNKNOWN Not, not if you haven't paid while you--unless you're . . . 

00:38:00
STEVEN FRANKEL Right, so it's at renewal time. That's when it--that's when the board finds out . . . 

00:38:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:38:05
STEVEN FRANKEL . . . or somebody finds out. Yeah. And, and I'll show you the statute. There's a statute that I'll, I actually found online in Missouri, ah, for MFTs and social workers. I'll--that's coming up in a, in an upcoming slide. I don't need to show you that. Uhm, here, effective July 1st, 2003, all persons and business entities applying for or renewing licenses with the Division of Professional Registration are required to have paid all state income taxes. That's your, that's the statute. Uhm, this is Oregon. These are psychologists. Competence issues. Ah, unlicensed practice. I had never seen that many cases of unlicensed practice. Uhm, unprofessional conduct, sex, a little bit, personal conduct, breaking a rule, supervision problems. These are--oops--LCSWs in Oregon. Uhm, more sex. This is MFTs and LPCs in Oregon. Ah, some sex, a lot of unprofessional conduct. So, so, ah, what you can see is that what gets us into trouble has to do with our competencies, has to do with, ah, our sexuality, has to do with, ah, a variety of things that are pretty consistent state to state to state. One of the biggest issues is a boundary issue. And so a bulk of what I'm going to do for the rest of the morning is to talk about boundaries because, of course, in boundaries is--if--I hope none of you know this from your own personal experience, but most licensing boards, many licensing boards, if they discipline somebody for a boundary violation, they require them--in California the actual statement goes like this: you are required to take a semester long college or university course in boundaries as part of your probation. Now how many of you believe there is such a thing as a college or university course in boundaries. Don't raise your hand. You'd be wrong at least in California. There aren't any. Ah, and so this is the closest we're going to come to a course in boundaries, the next couple of hours. And I actually have checked with a couple of licensing boards and have sent them these slides and they say yeah, we can't say this officially to endorse you, ah, cuz you, you're a business and like that, but yeah, do this, teach this. So we're going to talk about boundaries. And this is a, a blatant attempt for, for some appreciation and pity because of what I do, I have to curl up in bed with books on boundaries from time to time. My, my wif--as I told you, my wife is a psychiatrist. She tries to understand these things but, ah, I--it's part of my life. And so I've read a lot of books on boundaries. And of all the books I've ever read on boundaries, this is the only one that I really think is terrific. Ah, this is a 2008 publication and it's, ah, Tom Gutheil and Archie Brodsky, ah, who are from Boston. Ah, Gutheil is a psychiatrist and, and, ah, Brodsky's a colleague. And the book is terrific. It's about 300 pages, written in English, easy to understand. These guys have been around and they know what's going on. And, ah, with one exception, they have a blanket rule about you're not allowed to touch patients. Uhm, that's a--we'll, we'll talk about that later. But aside from that one thing, the book is really terrific. Uhm, and they tell stories. It, it teaches, it teaches you the way I sort of like to teach. So it tells you a story to, to try to make a point. So here's an example of a boundary story. Uhm, psychiatrist in New York lost his license to practice medicine. Here's how he lost it. He was seeing a woman in therapy for several years. The woman comes in one day and says, this is going to be our last session. He says how come? And she says, well my husband owns a company that's a big deal. It's being traded on the New York stock exchange and last night he signed the papers. He sold it. It's not even been announced yet. We bought a palace in another state and we're moving. So I'm, I'm out of here. And he says well, you know, congratulations, good luck. If you need a referral, let me know. And she goes out the door and as she does he picks up the phone and calls his stock broker and he says buy eight trillion shares of this company's stock for me please. And he reaps a lot of money. He gets a lot of money. He also gets a phone call from an agency. A licensing board is an agency. It's a state agency. This agency that contacted him is a federal agency. It's called the Secur--Securities, Securities Exchange Commission, and it's a watchdog agency that has the job of monitoring activity on the stock exchange to, to look for un--out of the ordinary act--activity. And they, they say so we, we saw that you bought eight trillion shares of this company that was just sold before it was announced and we wondered how did that happen? And breaching his patient's confidentiality, he told them how it happened and, ah, if you're convicted of a crime, which he was, a federal crime, ah, in any state, you'll get reported to your licensing board. All the licensing boards get reports of any criminal conviction. And, ah, the, the licensing board in New York gets a report of this and then they haul him in and they say what's up with this? And he tells him, again, ah, her confidentiality is in question. And, ah, they take his medical license. So what's the moral of the story? The moral of the story is that we're supposed to be amnestic for things our patients tell us in the office that could benefit us enormously if--when-- once they walk out the door. We're not supposed to take advantage of that. It's not supposed to--I mean, look, if a patient says there's a new ice cream parlor that just opened up, the--incredible ice cream and if you bought a cone, it wouldn't get us into trouble. Ah, but if we buy a gazillion shares of stock, that's going to get us into big trouble. So the moral--so that's the moral of the story. Ah, amnestic for what they tell us that could do--that could enhance us materially. Uhm, so boundaries. So let's talk about boundaries. A boundary is defined by these guys as the edge of appropriate behavior at a given moment in a relationship between a patient and a therapist as governed by the therapeutic context and contract. So if we deconstruct that sentence, here's what we get. The edge of appropriate behavior means one more step in the direction that we're going and we are no longer in a therapist's role. We are in some other role. That's the edge of appropriate behavior. Uhm, at a given moment in the relationship. That means that things that might not be appropriate to talk about or to share at one point in the relationship may be appropriate to share at another point in the relationship. Uhm, because we know somebody really well. We know them much better. Ah, we might disclose something more about ourselves later on in the therapy than early on in the therapy. Ah, that kind of thing. So at a given moment in the relationship between a patient and a therapist is governed by the therapeutic context and the context includes what kind of therapy is this? Are we doing cognitive behavior therapy? Are we doing systems therapy? Are we--what are we doing? Are we doing, ah, ah, a 12-step recovery kinds of stuff? Uhm, what is the cultural difference between us and our patients? Uhm, religious, spiritual orientations, a variety of different kinds of things that have to do with the context, and the contract. Uhm, this is when you can call me. This is when I start to charge you for calls. This is when I tell you to stop calling me, that--all that kind of stuff. So that's the definition of a boundary that they use. And a boundary crossing is a departure from the usual norms of therapy, the verbal and physical distances normally maintained in the therapeutic interaction, benign deviations from the standard of practice, those that are harmless and nonexploitive and may even support or advance the therapy. That's a boundary crossing and we'll talk about some examples of those in a minute. And a boundary violation is a boundary crossing that takes the therapist out of the professional role. Uhm, so, so that's what a boundary is, a boundary crossing and a boundary violation is. Having said that, they now talk about some--well that's just a summary of what I just said. Uhm, well let me just add one point to this. Everything about boundaries is about the psychological meaning to the patient and the--and to the therapist. And, and what it means is, is the, is the core issue always. And you'll see this issue coming up over and over again over the course of the day. So I told you that they, uhm, they say no touching at all. So two examples of the three examples they use for boundary crossing involve touching. I don't know. Uhm, the first one is extending a hand to help a patient who has stumbled and fallen. The second is giving a ride to a patient who is stranded in a blizzard and the third is withholding the human gesture of accepting the embrace of a patient who comes to the office sobbing because she's been involved of a sudden death in the family. Those are considered boundary crossings. So now they're going to take one of these, now I've told you already that they say no touching, right. So which one are they going to take? They're going to take giving the patient a ride when he or she was stranded in a blizzard. They stay away from the touching ones. Two of the three of those were touching. This one is not. And so, and because they're in Boston, they, they'll they'll talk about being stranded in a blizzard and things like that. That doesn't quite happen here. It doesn't quite happen where I am in California either, but who's counting. Ah, then they give you rules: behave professionally while in the car together. No personal revelations, exchanges that would be inappropriate in the office, don't conduct therapy outside the office, document the boundary crossing as relevant data, document that the therapist exercised clinical judgment, considered the possible impact on the patient in the therapy, at the next office visit debriefed the patient, opened up the incident for exploration and then note the boundary crossing in records, supervision, consultation, and note any reluctance to do this as a possible warning sign. So I put the caps there. That's my emphasis. And so let me pause here and, and comment about this. The most important thing I can tell you to take home from today about boundary stuff is that your greatest ally in protecting yourselves from boundary violations and boundary problems has to do with self-reflexivity, self-monitoring, ego--observing ego, whatever language you choose, paying attention to yourself. Uhm, that kind of self-reflexivity is critical to, to avoid boundary problems because if you're paying attention to yourself, you're asking yourself am I doing anything different in this person that I would do with anybody else? Am I handling this case in any way differently than I'd handle anybody else? Am I handling this case in any way differently than I'd handle anybody else? Am I following procedures that I would never do with anybody else? Is this person special in some way? Do I feel like this patient is lucky that they're so special and I'm so special for them? There's this slippery slope and self-monitoring is really the most important piece of prophylaxis that I can tell you. And you'll see it over the course of the morning, ah, that self-monitoring is critical. And we're going to talk about a test that's been developed an, an actual, ah, psychological--it's actually a psychiatric test. It was developed by psychiatrists for psychiatrists and it's the only test there is of boundary dangers, ah, that exist in our field. So we're going to talk about that. It's called the Exploitation Index. Uhm, what's important and--what's important about what I've capitalized is that documentation of boundary issues is the most effective prophylactic act you can, you can commit. Ah, there is a section in my own recordkeeping system that says patient statements and behaviors. And in that section of my, my, my recordkeeping, I write things that patients say that, that show what they got out of the session, what it means to them and things like that. But in that section I also write any boundary issue that comes up. I write what happened and how I responded. What the issue was, how it came up and how I responded. And I, and I do it in as much as a verbatim way as possible. So here's an example. Some of you may have heard this story but it's appropriate for this particular topic. One morning I have, uhm, two cancellations in my eight-hour therapy day which is unusual. And I figure I'm going to use the time effectively to do something to fix my desktop computer which is now malfunctioning. So I know that in two hours my, my favorite PTSDer's going to walk through the door. Uhm, and that what's going to happen is I can get this maybe fixed before she comes in and so I'm on the phone with the support people for my computer and I don't even realize but the two hours is virtually gone and we can't fix the computer. I am frustrated, angry, annoyed, perturbed, irritating and I want to take the computer and the support people and throw them through the window and I realize what time it is and I know who's coming through the door. And I slam the phone down and I make a clinical error. I don't take a second and sit before she walks through the door. I open the door and say come on in and as she comes in on that particular day because the--this category of patients has radar for what's going on with us. They walk into our building and they know what we are thinking and where our, our distress level is. It's like they, they got it. And as she walks in the door she says--and I quote--how old's your wife? Now my wife is a psychiatrist. We practice in the same suite, ah, and so that's--it's known that we're husband and wife. And I shot back, none of your business. 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN Oh! 

00:51:00
STEVEN FRANKEL I wasn't okay. And to show you how okay she was, she said was that supposed to be helpful? 

00:51:10
[sil.] 

00:51:15
STEVEN FRANKEL Now if you work with this kind of PTSDer, ah, with some Axis II involvement, ah, you know that that's as good as it gets. That's as good--that's why she's my favorite one. It's, it's because she does stuff like that. And by the time--by the time she said that, I was set and I said oh, it wasn't about you. I'm really sorry. I was just on the phone, computer people couldn't fix it, angry and you caught it as you walked in but it wasn't for you. I'm sor--I'm really sorry. She said you know, thanks so much for telling me that it wasn't about me because everything about you is about me. Isn't that wonderful. Ah, and, and then she said, so how old is your wife? And by that time, I was set and so I said, why do you ask? And she said, I just turned 52 and it's been 19 years--this person keeps records for herself. She goes back into her own records. It's been 19 years since I've been in a relationship with a man. I know that you're divorced and remarried and what I'm interested in is did you go after a young one because I'm worried that at 52, any man who would be age-appropriate for me wouldn't be interested in women my age. They'd want a young one. So I thought I'd ask you what you did. And I said, sounds like we're talking about grieving. The possibility of not being in a relationship forever as a result of the--what happened to you as a child. And she said, you know, that's really right. And we spent an hour doing grief work. On--at no point did I tell her how old, how old my wife is cuz that's none of her business or yours for that matter, ah, but I can tell you that I did not go after a young one. My wife is okay with me saying that. Uhm, and I wrote in my record patient stated colon, quote, how old's your wife, question mark, unquote. I said and I recorded the entire none of your business. Was that supposed to be helpful? Documented the entire interchange. And I do that with every boundary issue that comes up. I document what, what they said, how it came up, how I responded, how it got resolved. And the reason I've been doing--I've been doing this since the 1990's and the reason I'm--I do this is because I know who reads our records. It isn't colleagues. How many times have you read every record that a colleague has produced for a patient they've referred to you? Hardly ever, right? Most of us read maybe a page or two or a treatment summary and then we meet the patient and figure it out ourselves. Ah, who reads our records? Lawyers, lawyers read our records and experts that lawyers hire if we are in trouble in some way. And I want to make absolutely clear to the legal community if, if I ever fall into their get--bad graces as a clinician, ah, and to the licensing board community and so on, that I document boundary stuff. And that is an incredibly helpful prophylactic measure to take to keep us safe because no lawyer is going to get interested in filing any kind of action against me when they realize that I'm documenting boundary stuff. Ah, because it means that I know what a boundary issue is, I know how to deal with it and I'm not afraid to document it. And so I pass that along to you as a piece of friendly advice. So three axioms for boundary violations, this is a now here this everybody, the responsibility for setting and maintaining boundaries always belongs to the clinician. The patient is not blamed or stigmatized for violating therapeutic boundaries. And the next slide says the same thing but in a somewhat different language. And any interaction between two people, the actions of both play a contributing role. However, by axiom one the fact that the therapist and patient are in essence responsible for their own actions can't be translated into blaming the patient or victim. The reason I push this goes like this. Part of what I do as a lawyer is I defend colleagues like us when they have board inquiries from licensing boards and I ask them to begin by writing a response to what the patient said about them to the licensing board. And in many cases, especially those who are being reported to a licensing board by an Axis II involved patient will trash the patient. This is an Axis II involved hysterical borderline, narcissist acting out their primitive crap on me kind of stuff. This is not okay. You can't, you can't say that to a licensing board. That's not professional. I can say it. I'm a lawyer. I, I get to trash the complainant. But, but my professional colleague cannot trash the complainant. So it's very important that this axiom be, be seen as, as important, uhm, central. We can't blame them for the boundary violations. We have to take responsibility for what we do. And third is that research is important. And you'll see that the research data that, that I'm going to show you, uhm, is really helpful. So ethical principles for maintaining therapeutic boundaries, respect for the dignity of the patient, respect for the patient's authentic goals and choices. Ah, just because they aren't being--wanting to be who we think they should be doesn't mean that we shouldn't support them. Ah, and respect for the fiduciary relationship. Fiduciary relationships are relationships where the professional's needs come second and the patient's needs come first. In terms of boundary issues, there are several categories. The first one we're going to talk about are role issues. Ah, the second is time and the third is place, although I don't think that's a good--necessarily a good way to think about it. Ah, and there are three subdivisions of role-related issues as far as risk is concerned. The first is called role conflict. And role conflict is basically the multiple relationship issue. This is the dual relationship category. Uhm, multiple relationship--if you look at your, your national professional society's ethics code, this is true for psychiatry, psychology, social work, ah, marriage and family therapy and counselors. Our ethic--our ethics codes--well actually it's interesting for psychiatry. Uhm, psychiatry doesn't have its own ethics code per se. It uses the AMA's ethics codes with annotations for psychiatry. It--psychiatry's now working on an ethics code that stands free of the AMA's code but they use the AMA's code with annotations for psychiatry. Uhm, but our ethics codes all say the same thing, that not all dual relationships are unethical. Those which exploit the patient or compromise the clinician's judgment are unethical. Ah, sex is always unethical. Ah, but if they don't exploit the patient or compromise the clinician's judgment, but try--as, as I give you examples of these things, what you'll see is that it's really hard to prove that your judgment wasn't compromised and it's hard to prove that you didn't exploit a patient. Ah, the informed consent piece goes like this. I get a call from a psychiatrist who practices in San Francisco who says I want to close my practice. Ah, this is, this is a woman who'd been in practice for 30, 40 years. And she calls and says I want to talk about how to properly close my practice and I talked with her about it. And I hear from her about a year later and she says thank you for the help in closing my practice. She said, I did it in and it worked fine. I'm calling you with a related issue. Uhm, I got a letter sent by one of my former patients who, who I really like and respect. She's a woman that I saw for some years and I really feel good about the work we did together. She wrote me a letter. She sent it to my former office address and it got forwarded to my home. Ah, and she wants to be my friend. And wonders, wonders if we can be friends. And so I was calling you to get some consultation about whether that's okay. And, and, and how to think about it. I said okay. Have you answered the letter yet? No. Uhm, all right. So let's talk about what, what she would know about you if you became friends. What would she know about you that she doesn't know now if you became friends? And she said, well she'd know that, uhm, I bitch about my husband and I bitch about my kids and, uhm, and she went on a little bit and then she said, you know, I don't think this is a good idea. And I said, good. Good. Because that's the process you go through to decide whether it's a good idea or not. And, and it's especially important because if seeing you in a different light would in some ways impair the, the wellness that she achieved under your care, then you've got a real problem if you become friends. Because if part of her, her success in treatment with you was a function of how she regarded you, then this serial dual relationship, because this isn't a concurrent dual relationship, it's a serial one. First I'm the therapist, then I'm a friend. Ah, would be really risky for this particular woman. And she said, you know, that's really helpful. Thanks. Bye. Over and out. So that's a serial relationship-- dual relationship. Let me give you a story about a concomitant dual relationship. Uhm, this is about a therapist who practices in a large California city and who does a lot of workers comp and a lot of managed care kinds of stuff. He sees a patient in--through workers comp. He, he's a Caucasian therapist and the patient is an African-American woman who's not able to work because of emotional problems. They worked together for about three years. And she does great. She does great. She's back at work. Things are really good. She's feeling good about herself and all that stuff. And she says, can I continue to see you privately, not on workers comp anymore because that's not available. And he says sure. So they continue to do clinical work together. And she comes in one day and she says I got, I got a problem, that--a real life problem and I want to talk about it with you. Uhm, I, I'm a senior relative of a very large family from the Midwest and they're having a reunion and they've invited me and I'm a senior person. I haven't seen these folks in years. I want to go. But my problem is my car. I have a car that's very special to me. It's this make, model, year, color, texture and, and I have no garage for it and in the neighborhood where I live. If I park it on the street and it's there for more than 48 hours, somebody will either vandalize it or steal it or both. And I couldn't tolerate that. And he thinks about that for a second and then he says, well you know, my, my oldest son just took off for college and took one of the cars, so I have a space in my garage but I would have an interest in it, in, in, if there's an emergency situation, you know my wife is my office manager, so maybe one of us would need to use it. Would that be okay? Uhm, and she said well let's talk. And so he's documenting in his notes session by session. They take about five to 10 minutes for the next six sessions to talk about this and they talk about every piece of it. What happens if I have it out or my wife has it out and it gets in an accident? And she says well I have an insurance card. And dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. And so anyway, they talk about it. He documents it all because that's what we're supposed to do. We're supposed to document all that stuff. And she goes. Gives him the keys. Gives him the registration stuff, ever--all--insurance card and she goes. His wife takes it out two days later and somebody comes to a red light, drunk driver, smashes into the car. The insurance company totals it. That means the insurance company is not going to pay for it to be repaired. And they're going to pay only what it would be worth on the open market. Uhm, they are--the therapist and his wife are not in a good place. They're freaked out. And they are really sad. So what they do is they go online and they find about eight of these same cars, color, texture, model, make, year, all that huff. They actually go to see them. They find one that's virtually identical to the one she had. Ah, they have pictures of it, all that kind of stuff. When she comes back, they talk and they say, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. And here's--and we'll pay for whatever the insurance payment doesn't cover for you to buy the same car that you had before. She says great. We talked about it. She was fine with it. And when's her next appointment and all this stuff, her sister wasn't fine with it. Her sister was really distressed about it. And her sister began to grind on her until she convinced her to file a small claims court claim and they appear in small claims court and the judge says, I'm not understanding why you're here. Uhm, what you're telling me is that the car got destroyed but the person who was driving it--the people who had it--are giving you enough money so that that plus the insurance will buy the same identical car. How, how, what is it that you want from me? You, you've been made whole. And the sister went off like a rocket and the judge threw them out of court. And then the sister began to grind on the patient to make a licensing board complaint, which she did. The licensing board took the position that this was an unethical dual relationship and revoked the therapist's license and put a stay on the revocation and put him on probation for five years. What that means is no workers comp cases, no managed care cases. The only cases he could get from that point on were private referrals from people who believed him, ah, because you can't get referrals from any kind of organized referral program once you've had a board action like that. We'll, we'll talk more about that later, ah, about how the board reached its decision and I'll tell you one more dual relationship case just to show you how--to make a point, uhm, that even, even relationships that, that should not in any reasonable person's mind meet the criteria for impairing the therapist's judgment, ah, a board can decide to the contrary. This is about a, a guy who's a therapist in, in California who's, who does two kinds of work with people. Uhm, he, he's trained in Jungian analysis and he does Jungian-oriented kind of ther--psychotherapy. He also is a trained body therapist and he does body work. And one, one afternoon, one evening, he's seeing a patient who is a 20-year old college student, female who lives about an hour from his office. And on this particular occasion, it isn't always the case, but on this particular occasion, he--she was his last patient of the day and he did body stuff with her, ah, and she--when she left, it was dark. And about five minutes after she leaves his office, she's banging on the door and he opens the door and he says what's up? And she says my car won't start and I'm stuck and I don't know what to do. And so he says well, uhm, do you have Auto Club and she didn't and he didn't. And then he said well, what'd you think? What, what'd you want to do. She said, well I'll call my mom and I'll call my dad. They're, they're not together but I'll each of them and if I--if one of them comes around, they'll help me. So she, she calls her mom and she calls her dad and neither are available. Uhm, so she leaves messages and then she says now I don't know what to do at all. And he says well here are some options. Uhm, I, I can put you in a cab. I'll pay for the cab. You'll reimburse me and the cab will take you home. Uhm, I'll put you up in a hotel. I'll pay for the hotel and you'll reimburse me and you'll get your mom or your dad to come in the morning. Ah, a third option is, uhm, I--if need be, I can drive you home and I'll charge you for half the time of the trip. You know, pick one. And she says no, I can't, I can't do any of those. I'm not okay with any of that. And then he says well I don't know what else to do and she's beginning to get uncomfortable. Ah, she's a 20-year old college student and she's not personality disordered but she's beginning to get agitated. And he's thinking I can't just leave her sitting here on my doorstep. It's 8:00 at night. It's dark. Ah, if she's here--she's here, I, I, something bad happens, I can't do it. So they go round and round for a little bit longer and finally he says look, uhm, you can sleep in the office. You--there's a couch. Ah, there's a bathroom. Ah, there's water. Ah, you know, sleep in--how about sleep in the office. I'll, I'll lock you in and you can get out yourself but I'll come back in the morning. No, I can't do that. I can't do that. I can't do that. Finally, he says look, I got a granny unit behind my house. It's unoccupied, nobody lives in it. I live in the front with my older son. Ah, ah, I can show you how to barricade the door, nobody will bother you and we'll get you out in the morning and take you to the office and you can call your mom. She said okay. So he puts her in the granny unit. And they go back the next morning and the mom wants to know what kind of body therapy this guy is doing, what is she wearing, how does he touch her, all this kind of stuff. And so she decides that she's going to report him to his licensing board. After a year of investigation and deliberation, the board comes to a decision. The deputy attorney general, who's the lawyer who represents the board, calls me on the phone and says the board isn't going to revoke his license. I said uh-oh because I knew what was coming. She said the board is going to dish out the least drastic measure that it has available to it. I said yeah. And let me tell you what that is. It's called a public letter of reproval. It's one step before revoking somebody's license. The public letter of reproval goes like this. The board publishes on its letterhead in your hometown newspaper for two days every day of the week, a letter that says you did this bad thing. 

01:08:35
UNKNOWN Oh! 

01:08:35
UNKNOWN Hmm! 

01:08:40
STEVEN FRANKEL And detailing what it was that the person did. And so that's what they did. Uhm, I said to the deputy attorney general, does the board have any advice? If I'm going to use this as an example when I teach people about boundary things, does the board have any advice about what he should have done? What, what did the board want him to do? What would a board want him to do? Uhm, and what I got back was the board's job is not to tell people what to do. It's just to react to what they did do. I said cut the crap. Does, does anybody have any suggestions from the board side about what somebody in this position ought to do? I mean, you know, let's just talk adults. You and me. What'd you think? Sorry, can't do that. Uhm, what I think he could have done, the only I can think of that he could have done was to get more assertive. This is not an assertive guy. This is a very, very nice, gentle, easy-going, thoughtful guy who didn't say pick one of these options. I'm walking, you know. Do it now. Make a decision, ah, cuz we're not going to stay in here all night and, and really push it and set, set those kinds of limits. Not like you would with certain kinds of patients that are character-logically disturbed. But in a firm kind of way. But I don't know what else he could have done. Uhm, so, so, so those are examples of dual relationships and how boards react to them. 

01:10:10
UNKNOWN Is it dual if like you call a taxi and she would have had-- and--to reimburse you? 

01:10:15
STEVEN FRANKEL If, if you called a taxi and she had to reimburse you that's not what the board would call a dual relationship. Uhm, that would be a therapeutic kind gesture. Ah, that's my thinking. So, so it was the fact that he took her to his home even though she didn't sleep in his, in the building that housed him and his son. She slept in a separate building. That was considered dual relationship by the board. Okay, uhm, the other thing I, I, I need to mention is this informed consent piece. If, if you're going to be in a dual relationship, it's really important that you talk about what the boundaries are, what can be expected, how it might impact the way that the therapy is going or, or could go or should go. There's got to be a whole bunch of informed consent stuff that's done. That's we-- that's what I talked about with the psychiatrist, you know, what--if, if you were going to be a friend of this patient, this former patient of yours, what would you tell her about what she'd learn about you? What would be the informed consent piece? So the informed consent piece is important. Uhm, so then comes role deviation and role deviation has to do with helping outside of therapy. Ah, the first is called gratuitous advice. What falls in this category of gratuitous advice are things like this: I went to this really good restaurant. You'd love it. Why don't you try it. Has nothing to do with the therapy. Or I saw this great movie, you ought to go see it. Has nothing to do with the therapy. That's gratuitous advice. Uhm, in certain kinds of therapies with certain kinds of patients that might not be a bad thing to do because if you're working out of a more existential model and you are really using your own self-disclosures as a way to engage somebody therapeutically, those kinds of things might not be unheard of. But, in general, gratuitous advice is not thera--it's not a therapeutic intervention and they don't like it. The most frequently occurring therapeutic intervention in our field, can you get me out of jury duty? It's a very fre-frequent request that therapists get from their patients. Can you get me out of jury duty. And the, the answer is go see a disability evaluator and get a disability evaluation. If the, the disability evaluator says that you're not fit for jury duty, they'll write, write it up. I'm your therapist. That's--getting you out of jury duty is not my job. That's, that's an extra-therapeutic intervention. Ah, and apparently this happens so often that they have a special category of balancing the checkbook. Somebody is so disorganized that they are not balancing the checkbook and the therapist says to the patient, bring in their checks, their, their bills, ah, all this kind of stuff and, and write checks in the office. Uhm, the intervention is get a bookkeeper and let's work on ways you can organize yourself better. Then role reversal. We have many patients who delight if we disclosure something about, something about our lives that they can respond to us therapeutically with. So, so let me tell you a--let me tell you about December 26th, 19--ah, 2009, no, 2008. Uhm, every year between Christmas and New Year's my wife and I take off work and we hang out with our now 15-year old daughter, god help us all. Uhm, and we typically watch series of movies so we'll watch the Bourne series or we'll watch the Harry Potter series or you--we, we watch a series of movies and we eat and we do annual chores. And my annual chore--one of my annual chores that I do every year. I've been doing it for years and years and years is to clean out the, the gutters around the roof. Ah, get all the, the leaves and crap out of them. And so on December 26th of 2008, I go up on the roof and I clean out the gutters and I'm coming down and the feet of the ladder, as I'm coming down, I put two feet on the ladder and the feet of the ladder on tile, a tile patio, and the feet of the letter start to skid out from under me. And I see that the ladder is going to fall, and me with it. And so I then, you know how time does weird things when you're in an emergency kind of situation. So it took about 10 minutes for me to fall. But in that 10 minutes, I had this, this revelatory experience. I, I had a real epiphany. I was--I said this is going to be really cool. I'm going to grab the gutter as I go floating by it. I'm going to break my fall and then I'm going to release and drop lively to the ground below and everything is going to be cool. Watch me now. With one error in my analysis and that is that the gut--gutter was soaking wet because I'd just swept out all of the leaves and the water that collected with the leaves and the gutter was wet and so my grip didn't hold. It--my hands lost their grip. But they did jerk my body. It did grab and my feet came up in front of me like this and I fell flat on my back on the ladder. 

01:15:05
UNKNOWN Oh! 

01:15:05
STEVEN FRANKEL My head smashed into the tile between two of the rungs but I didn't lose consciousness and I knew, of course, from my training that that was important. Uhm, I, ah, I knew I broke two ribs because I'd broken a rib skiing and I know what a broken rib feels like. So I broke two ribs back here. Uhm, and my kidney took a whopping so I was having some blood in my urine. And, uhm, and I had hairline fractures in my lumbar spine, which of all the things that happened to me that was the most painful because those fractures are-- you have wincing pain from them. So, uhm, we went to the emergency room and, ah, I learned something I never knew. Right after Christmas, the emergency rooms do an incredibly big business from people who fall off their roo--roofs and ladders when taking down their Christmas decorations. And they said, oh you fell off your roof taking down your Christmas decorations. I said, no I'm not observant and, and so, ah, ah, so I said, I told them what happened and they, they did scans of my head and of my thorax and so on and my abdomen and what they knew--what they found was what I just told you. I knew, I knew pretty much what had happened. I was grateful that, uhm, I didn't have anything more happening with the swelling in the brain because that would have--I wouldn't be here today. Ah, I'd be corpse-like or unconscious someplace. Ah, so I, I, I came through that one okay. But I had a real problem because I was--they gave me--what'd they give me? They gave me, ah, ah, one of the pain meds that just makes me whippy woozy and I stopped taking it, ah, cuz I don't like it. So I took, ah, ah, Motrin. And I had a decision to make cuz I went back to work the next week. And the decision I had to make was because I wasn't live and lik--lively like I usually am. I was moving very slowly because any twisting motion at all and I had bad news. Ah, so I had to decide which of my patients, if I--if any, I was going to tell what happened. Uhm, and I made a decision. I have, uhm, I have a couple of patients in my practice who are physicians. And they are both dissociative. And, uhm, I decided I would tell them but I would tell everybody else. And all my other patients came in and I said what happened and I got what you would expect. I got poor sweet baby, and then let's talk about me. Ah, and that went as I would, would have predicted and expected. The, the two physicians I didn't tell. And the reason I didn't tell them was because they would become my doctors. Not in the immediate present. I wasn't worried about that. Ah, I wasn't worried about oh, did you get the right kind of scan and all that. That's, that's not what I was worried about. What I was worried about was that beyond the usual monitoring that they were doing of me cuz all of my patients monitor, you know, trauma survivors from childhood, they monitor every--like my patient said, everything about me is about you is about me. Uhm, I didn't want them to become my doctors in the sense of following my cognitive functions for the next eight months because they're going to be looking at how--what's my eye blinks doing, what are my--do I have word-finding problems more than I normally have word-finding problems because, you know, I'm, I'm 69. I have word probl--word-finding problems. Ah, I couldn't think of the medication that they gave me just a minute ago. So, so, ah, they'd be monitoring for that. And I didn't want that. So I didn't tell them. I just sat in my chair and said I'm going to make a note--why don't you come on in--from my past session and while--I'll make a note when you're gone. Goodbye. Ah, and I didn't tell them. I, I told them actually much, much later after it was all over, ah, for months. But not right away. So, so the self-disclosures become things that have to do with, with whom, for what purpose, to what end. And, and what's the therapeutic impact of certain kinds of self-disclosures. The ones we need to look out for are the role reversal ones. That's the--that's the role problem. Ah, and then they talk about time. I, I don't like this category because it's not really about time. It's about doing things with a patient that you wouldn't do with any other patient. More time, ah, extended session, ah, a lot more flexibility in billing, ah, any, any kind of decisions that you make that are different with a given person that you wouldn't do with anybody else. When I was in law school and I, I took the, the course in legal ethics, which is not always an oxymoron, ah, I, I wrote a paper on something that the legal community actually has kept pretty secret. Uhm, but is getting to be known more broadly now. Ah, the frequency of sex between attorneys and their clients is very high in the community of lawyers who do divorce law. And it's high in the sense that, ah, the, the clients are vulnerable. They're angry. They're feeling rejected, hurt, upset. Ah, and, and boundary stuff comes up between them and their lawyers. And so I wrote a paper about it in, in law school. And the analysis I gave was the same analysis I use with mental health professionals. It's the same kind of slippery slope. It begins with this person and I are on the same wave length. We--I really resonate to this person. They really resonate to me. We have the same sense of humor. We, we're really connected. And I like to see them more than I like to see other people I see who are not connected to me that way. And the next step is and this person is sure lucky to have me as a therapist because I really get them. And then the next step is yeah, they're, they're, they're not doing well but that means that they're shedding their old brittle and not effective defensive operations and they're going to come back with new flexible ones and they'll do better and then it's a mess. Uhm, tha--that kind of, of, of problem. So it's, it's treating somebody differently than you treat anybody else. And the particular content of the slide is, is not, is not accurate. It's as it, as it expresses itself. It's really about treating somebody differently than you treat anybody else and that takes self-monitoring to look at. Ah, and then comes places. Uhm, ah, if you work out of an office in a tradition way--I had an interesting phone call. I had a phone call from a therapist who wanted to talk to me about building a practice. She came in and she said, I want you to know something. I've solved one of the problems that therapists have. I, I don't have an office. I don't have to, to spend money on an office every week, every month. I said how do you see the people that you see? She says well I drive to their houses. And I said well, do you work a population where home visits are, are appropriate? And she said well, do you have a rationale for why you see your patients in an office? I said you know what, that sounds very funny and sexy here in the office between us but tell it in front of a judge. Ah, that's not going to look so funny and sexy if you say it in a courtroom. If you don't have a rationale for why you see you see everybody where you see them, you've got a problem. Let's, let's think it all through. Uhm, so where you see people makes a difference. If you use a home office, your neighbors are going to know who you see. Ah, there's that issue. They're going to know where you live. That may be an issue. Ah, a lot of people use home offices. There's nothing wrong it. It's a matter of what population you work with and whether it's appropriate to work with that population in your home office or not. Ah, but the rules are somewhat different in all the different kinds of ways that we, we see people. I want to take a minute and talk to you about high tech, uhm, because we're having increasing issues come up about whether and in what way we can use the electronic developments in, in the world to provide clinical services. Uhm, so I want to talk about the use of, of computers and the internet to provide clinical services. And, and here's what I want to tell you. Uhm, of all the forms of clinical interaction that are available, the one that's the most dangerous in, in an ethical, legal kind of context, risk management context, is email. Uhm, and, and the reason that email is the most risky is that it's only one channel of communication. It's the written word. And with written words, the probability of misunderstandings is higher than in any other form of interaction. If you talk with somebody on the phone, you hear the words but you also hear the voice and you can hear tonal inflections and you can hear affect and so on. And you can clarify things pretty quickly. Uhm, if you use Skype or one of the teleconferencing services that's perfectly fine. Uhm, I have a patient who, ah, who I saw--who I see in the Bay area. We both live there. And her mom was, was dying and was in Hawaii and so she moved to be in Hawaii to be, to be with her mom through her passing. And since she didn't intend to stay there, ah, and live in Hawaii but was just visiting, I could continue, I could send my services across state lines from California into Hawaii to her without violating Hawaii state law. And I saw her on Skype or ooVoo or iChat video or gmail video, any of those were fine. And, and it worked very well because I could see her. She could see me. Oops, sorry. I could see her. She could see me. Uhm, I could hear her. She could hear me. It, it all, it all went perfectly reasonably. And then when she came back, we just continued. So teleconferencing software, ah, is fine. Then the other issue that comes up is can you send your services across state lines using the internet. And the answer is very complicated. So let me give you the answers. Let me give you the pieces of the answer cuz we now have the capacity to send services globally and receive, receive communications globally. Is that okay? And the answers are, are really kind of complicated. So let me start with the basic reality. The constitution of this country, U.S. Constitution, says anything that we don't talk about that's run by the federal government is left to the states. Among the things that's left to the states is licensing of healthcare professionals. That's us. Uhm, so each state has its own licensing law and its own rules. And so the questions that come up are what are the rules about sending one's services across state lines? I'll teach you a legal word. The word is domicile. You are domiciled in a state if you live there, pay taxes there and intend to stay there. You are domiciled in a state if you live there, intend to stay there and pay taxes in that state, you are domiciled in that state. When somebody from another state comes to see you in your state, you may see them in your state. Anybody that comes to you in your office or wherever you work to avail themselves of your services, no matter where they come from, you can provide services to them without breaking any state laws. Once they go home, then you've got a problem because if they have a home that's not in your state and their home is outside of your state and they live there, pay taxes there and intend to stay in that other state, then you cannot send your services across state lines to them without one of two conditions. You neither--either need to be licensed in that state where you are sending your services or you need a temporary permit in that state. And states generally have rules about temporary permits. Each state has a different kind of rule. So you need to see--check and see what your state permits say. Otherwise, you can't send services across state lines. So I did one of these programs for Kaiser in, in Portland, Oregon. The Kaiser facility in Portland, Oregon sits on the border between Oregon and Washington state, Vancouver, Washington. And the clinicians that treat people in Washington from Washington who live in Washington but who are only licensed in Oregon can't do it without getting a license in Washington as well. Uhm, if you, if you practice at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School, you're in the south--you're, you're in the westernmost part of Pennsylvania, your catchment area comes from Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and when those patients come to you in Pittsburgh, you can treat them but once they cross state lines and go back home, unless you are licensed, you cannot. Okay. So if you are going to send your services across a state line or that becomes an issue, you need to contact the licensing board in that state where you want to send your services to that governs your license and say what goes on with you with permits for temporary services. And you'll get an answer. Ah, I'm, I'm representing a, a therapist right now who is licensed in Minnesota, came to California, is moving to California, getting a license in California and while she's here, she's doing some consultation for another therapist by meeting with the therapist patients and providing consultation. And she signed a receipt for one of these patients who, who paid her and the patient turned around and sent it to her insurance company. The insurance company wants--has decided to throw her off their panel because she saw a patient in California, charged her but she has no license in California only in Minnesota. We are appealing that decision because the statute in California says that for LCSWs, this is an LICSW from Minnesota, this--the analogous license in California is an LCSW, the--what the statute in California says that if you're doing consultation, the laws governing LCSWs do not apply to you. You can do consultation all you want. No problem. So we are appealing this decision that the board has made--that this insurance company has made, ah, to, to throw her off their panel. Uhm, so you need to know what, what the laws are in each of the states into which you send services. If you're a psychologist, I have some interesting news for you, if you don't know about it already. And if you're not a psychologist, listen to what I'm about to say because I'm recommending that, that other professions follow this model. There is an organization that's now probably 20, 30 years-old called the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards. Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards. It's www.asppb. And what it does is it--if you want to avail yourself of its services, you send your credentials in and that organization stamps you as qualified and if you are qualified and you meet their standards, you can become eligible for what they call a certificate of mobility. They then turn to the states, all 50 states plus D.C. and all nine provinces and say we have a cadre of psychologists who meet standards that we have who are qualified and have met our standards, would you let them practice in your state. And the states are signing up. So they're allow--it's, it's a reciprocity organization. It's building reciprocity so that psychologists can move from state to state. There are two groups of psychologists who avail themselves of this particular service mostly. Ah, one are the forensics because forensic who--if you build a very big, strong forensic practice, you're, you're going to get known nationwide and you're going to go practice in a variety of states and you're going to need licenses in those states so the mobility certificate is really helpful. And the others are for those of us who want to retire slowly in another state. So we have a home that we want to go retire in and we want to continue to do some practice in our retiring period. And we want to be able to do that where that--not in our state home is. Those, those two groups seem to be the most frequent users of this certificate of mobility. Uhm, I think this is a great idea because it addresses a problem that we have that is a constitutional problem in--by its nature and there is, there is no national license to practice our profession. It's a state by state by state license. 

01:30:55
UNKNOWN Ah, what if you have somebody who is, ah, let's see in the military. And they're in Germany or in Europe. 

01:31:00
STEVEN FRANKEL If you're working with military people, its federal and you're free to do that. 

01:31:05
UNKNOWN Or even if there was a corporation, not in the military. They're in Europe somewhere. They can only speak English and they want to have some therapy and if its federal now because it--is it because it's international . . . 

01:31:15
STEVEN FRANKEL It's international . . . So, so the question, the question is what about people who are not in the military but who are not in this country who are abroad in some other place. The, the answer is you have to see what that country's policies and laws are about licensing people because the, the western democracies, using the term loosely, ah, ah, typ--typically have, ah, licensing laws. And certain middle eastern countries have licensing laws. And so you have to look at their licensing laws and see what the licensing laws of those countries say about sending your services into those countries. And if there's no law that, that exists in the country where this person is, then you're not prohibited from sending your services to them. But if there are laws, then you have to follow what those laws have to say. Sir? 

01:31:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, I've often been curious about these, ah, radio and television talk shows where they have med--medical doctors, psychologists, whatnot on their radio or television and people call in and they're giving them advice. What is their liability? 

01:32:15
STEVEN FRANKEL Uhm, this is, this is both a new and an old question. Ah, this question first came up during the seventies when we had the first of the radio talk shows with psychologists who began to do radio things. And, and now with Dr. Phil and other kinds of folks who are doing these things now. What, what, what they're saying is that this is not therapy, these are not professional services. This is entertainment. If you look at Dr. Phil's website, it's loud and clear, this is entertainment. I am not providing a professional service, ah, this, this is entertainment. And they're, and they're trying to avoid, ah, liability as a result of that. Ah, there may be some litigation that is going on with some of them. I've heard rumors to that effect but I don't--I'm not aware of any specific cases yet. Sir? 

01:33:10
UNKNOWN Ah, a different version of the same question. What if you're licensed in say California. 

01:33:15
STEVEN FRANKEL Yeah. 

01:33:15
UNKNOWN You travel to Minnesota and six of your patients in California do Skype sessions with you. They're in California. 

01:33:20
STEVEN FRANKEL No problem. 

01:33:20
UNKNOWN You're in Minnesota. 

01:33:20
STEVEN FRANKEL That's not, that's not a problem. 

01:33:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:33:25
STEVEN FRANKEL Because you're, you're sending your services into your own state where you are licensed. And so that's no problem. 

01:33:30
UNKNOWN Okay. Thank you. 

01:33:30
STEVEN FRANKEL Come, come over and, and use the mic because otherwise I'll have to remember to repeat your questions. And I don't want to do that. Yeah, go ahead. 

01:33:35
UNKNOWN So I had a pa--I work out of California and I had a patient who I was doing a phone session with who told me at the very end . . . 

01:33:40
STEVEN FRANKEL Little bit louder. You, you . . . 

01:33:45
UNKNOWN Sorry. 

01:33:45
STEVEN FRANKEL . . . work in California. 

01:33:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, I'm licensed in California and had a patient who I was doing a phone session with tell me at the very end of session that she was in Nevada. So . . . 

01:33:55
STEVEN FRANKEL So the patient called you . . . 

01:33:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:33:55
STEVEN FRANKEL . . . from Nevada. 

01:33:55
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

01:33:55
STEVEN FRANKEL And they live in Nevada? 

01:33:55
UNKNOWN No, California. 

01:34:00
STEVEN FRANKEL If they're Californians, you can see them no matter, and provide services, no matter where they go. 

01:34:00
UNKNOWN Oh, okay. 

01:34:00
STEVEN FRANKEL If they're, if they're college students and they go to a college in a different state, you can see them--provide services to them--in that other state cuz they're not domiciled in that other state. Uhm, if they're on, on a work, ah, temporary placement, you can, you can provide services to them. As long as they are domiciled, they, they live in California, maintain a residence, pay taxes in California and intend over the long term to stay, you can, you can treat them no matter where they go. Sir? 

01:34:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:34:30
UNKNOWN I just need to have you repeat the name of it. 

01:34:35
STEVEN FRANKEL Repeat the name of the organization. Yes, okay. It's--I'll give you the, the website address and then I'll, I'll say the name of the organization. It's www.asppb. 

01:34:45
UNKNOWN You said NP? 

01:34:50
STEVEN FRANKEL ASPPB. It is the Association of State Psych--and Provincial Psychology Boards. 

01:34:55
UNKNOWN Is that .org? 

01:35:00
STEVEN FRANKEL .org. Sir? 

01:35:00
UNKNOWN So the question is, uhm, by the way, Portland, Oregon, Kaiser. 

01:35:05
STEVEN FRANKEL Welcome. 

01:35:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. And, ah, question is if I have a patient-- and this happens--who lives across the river in Vancouver but comes to see me in Portland but then calls me, maybe an emergency or seeking advice or something like that, from Vancouver. Am I in danger of any sort or . . . 

01:35:30
STEVEN FRANKEL Ah, technically yes. The likelihood of it happening is really low. I mean we're, we're talking about very low probability events that somebody's going to go after somebody and report--they'd have to report you to the, the Washington state licensing board . . . 

01:35:40
UNKNOWN Oh. 

01:35:40
STEVEN FRANKEL . . . for your license and unless there's a major falling out between you and the patient, it's not going to happen. So it's a--in reality it's a very low risk. But it's, it's there. Sir? 

01:35:55
UNKNOWN Hi, hi. I'm a licensed psychotherapist in California. 

01:36:00
STEVEN FRANKEL Uh-huh. 

01:36:00
UNKNOWN And, ah, as far as the entertainment, ah, questions--see these are just statements I'm going to make. Dr. Laura, Dr. Phil, ah, some other, some other radio hosts . . . 

01:36:10
STEVEN FRANKEL Right. 

01:36:10
UNKNOWN . . . have all given up their license so that they, uhm, for, for a number of reasons, uhm, and they, and they do state they're entertainers. So that, that's just across the board. Ah, unfortunately, Dr. Phil went into a hospital with the--I think it was Brittany Spears or someone--and, ah, for some odd reason he decided to do services and get got called on it. So that, that's what that's about. 

01:36:40
STEVEN FRANKEL Yes. 

01:36:40
UNKNOWN And, uhm, were, weren't you a part of the panel of, uhm, can I saw a nam--a magazine name as far as an ethical series, ah, web, webinar series in September. Ah, can I say the magazine's name? 

01:36:55
STEVEN FRANKEL Ah, I'm not following. 

01:36:55
UNKNOWN Ah, Psychotherapy Networker. 

01:36:55
STEVEN FRANKEL Yes, Psychotherapy Networker. 

01:36:55
UNKNOWN You were, you were one of the . . . 

01:37:00
STEVEN FRANKEL Yes, I was one of the speakers. 

01:37:00
UNKNOWN It was excellent. 

01:37:00
STEVEN FRANKEL Oh, thank you. 

01:37:00
UNKNOWN And, ah, on there, uhm, it was either you or Dr. Zor who pointed out a couple websites that I think is extremely important, timely and up to date about, ah, what therapists are exposed to. Ah, a lawyer's written one. It's called I think, ah, therapistabuse.com and you, you can read in, you know, just volumes of stuff on, on how, uhm, how lawyers will, ah, ask their clients to gather information to, to, you know, place the grounds for a lawsuits. And one of the, the, ah, ah, lawyers were stating, ah, the first time he sees a patient he says sit down and write everything you know about a therapist. His, you know, his life, his car, his or her, you know, relationships. And, ah, that's what we'll start to talk about. So, so that, that was very striking to me. It was just amazing. 

01:37:55
STEVEN FRANKEL We're actually going to be talking about a case where that exact, that happened. 

01:38:00
UNKNOWN And then again, ah, I'm not sure if it was you or Dr. Zor but, ah, there's very many, ah, ah, up-to-date articles on these type lawsuits. And, and, you know, I think it's, ah, ah, pretty evident that, ah, ah, litigation is going on. And one of the things that I got from that whole series was, ah, many of the malpractice attorneys are--will say to you, why, you know, why do therapists do anything outside of their office because that's where the lawsuits come in. 

01:38:30
STEVEN FRANKEL Except there are certain kind--actually, I'm not sure the majority are, are out of the office. There, there may be a hunk of them. But there are people who provide services to children and families where they make home visits. 

01:38:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:38:45
STEVEN FRANKEL The, those are, those are less, less risky. 

01:38:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, okay. And, and the one last statement, ah, I know from, ah, European colleagues, uhm, probably folks who are here. Uhm, the United States is looked at as, ah, having, ah, premier, ah, ah, colleges and education institutes and licenses. So the U.S. license is really, ah, well-respected around the world so it's, it's quite, ah, easy to get licensed in a, in a country, ah, wherever you're going to practice, they want their taxes so that's really why you need to, you know, get that license or even in the states, the United States, uhm, you should get that whatever you called it in each and every state that you're going to do anything in because they want their taxes so, uhm, I think it's as, ah, U.S. therapists we're, we're pretty well covered but you do need to get those kind of, uhm, uhm, whatever those certificates you just mentioned. 

01:39:35
STEVEN FRANKEL A temporary permit, a license of some sort. 

01:39:35
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:39:35
STEVEN FRANKEL Sure. 

01:39:35
UNKNOWN Okay, thank you. 

01:39:35
STEVEN FRANKEL Thank you. Last three people and then we're going to take a break. 

01:39:45
UNKNOWN Uhm, patients very often ask about al--alternatives to, ah, prescription medications, about natural supplements. A colleague of mine sometimes gives out printed information from books and magazines about natural supplements but writes on the, on the literature a medical disclaimer, this is not a medical recommendation of mine, never start or stop a supplement or, or prescription med without consulting your M.D. first. Is she protected? 

01:40:15
STEVEN FRANKEL Ah, depends on the state. 

01:40:15
UNKNOWN California. 

01:40:15
STEVEN FRANKEL California? 

01:40:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:40:20
STEVEN FRANKEL Psychologist? 

01:40:20
UNKNOWN Ah, no. MFT. 

01:40:20
STEVEN FRANKEL Ah, not sure what the MFC board said--what the BBS says about that specifically. The Psychology Board says you can do that, uhm, under those circumstances. You can actually give advice if you, if you have training. 

01:40:30
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

01:40:30
STEVEN FRANKEL So if you're trained, if you have training and background in nonprescription, ah, alternative, ah, agents, ah, you can, you can make recommendations. 

01:40:45
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:40:45
STEVEN FRANKEL Yeah. 

01:40:45
UNKNOWN All right. Yes, please feel free to answer this if you're going to incorporate it later. First you alluded to, ah, when you presented the, the book on--I'm referring to boundary issues, the rule never touch a patient and then mentioned about, ah, doing energy work. Ah, so if you had any different, ah, recommendations, ah, concerning that and whether or literally, ah, unless you clearly can document your competence in an area, don't touch a patient. Ah, the other area which you might get to later is the issue of coaching. So in other words, your a licensed psychologist but the relationship is phrased as coaching and whether the issue also is whether you are practicing in a state other than your licensed . . . 

01:41:35
STEVEN FRANKEL I'll, I'll, I'll cover both of those later. 

01:41:35
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:41:35
STEVEN FRANKEL Uh-huh. 

01:41:40
UNKNOWN If you're a counselor, I think there's a comparable board, the NBCC. And then, you know, as far as, as practicing in another state and getting your license. The other thing is, uhm, I would, I would suggest that, ah, you check with your licensing board before you do counseling via Skype because the Missouri board, ah, for purposes of counselors, uhm, it, it's not okay yet. 

01:42:05
STEVEN FRANKEL Really? Really? 

01:42:05
UNKNOWN Yes. None of that stuff. There's been discussion about all that stuff but . . . 

01:42:10
STEVEN FRANKEL That's really interesting. 

01:42:15
UNKNOWN . . . it's not been approved. 

01:42:15
STEVEN FRANKEL Thanks for the information. I, I didn't know that. Ah, because it's, it's been, it's been endorsed, ah, by federal law at this point, ah, for HIPPA. It endorses using teleconferencing software. Ah, most states that I'm aware of are . . . 

01:42:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, we're still talking about whether you can do supervision that way. 

01:42:30
STEVEN FRANKEL Oh. 

01:42:30
UNKNOWN So it will be a while. 

01:42:30
STEVEN FRANKEL I got it. Thanks. 

01:42:35
UNKNOWN I'm talking about something that happened 30 years ago and right now I'm retired but I'm going to be re-licensed if I passed my exam . . . 

01:42:45
STEVEN FRANKEL Uh-huh. 

01:42:45
UNKNOWN . . . in legal and ethics. Okay, I have a colleague in Hawaii and our informed consents used to say that when I go on vacation, I have a colleague in California who's going to come here and will see you and we state each other's competencies. And we did that in the past. As long as I get a temporary permit, is that legal? They stay in my home, I stay in their, their home, we go to our own offices. 

01:43:15
STEVEN FRANKEL If you get a temporary permit, you can send your services to wherever you get the permit to send them. 

01:43:15
UNKNOWN Okay, it doesn't matter? Okay. One other question. I have a, I have, I'm proposing a home office until I have recovered from my physical condition. And the people come in the home office. There's a, like a Shoji screen. It's all private and all that. They go upstairs. The catch is it's obvious what the religion is because there's a Mezuzah on the door. 

01:43:40
STEVEN FRANKEL Okay. 

01:43:40
UNKNOWN Is that going to create a problem because they're going to see what religion I am? 

01:43:45
STEVEN FRANKEL I don't, I don't think that's a problem that they know what your religion is. It's--it would be a problem if you tried to avoid talking about it. Uhm, if, if you, if there's enough religiosity in you, and spirituality in you of that kind where you, you have the Mezuzah on your door, you might, you might want to, as a part of the informed consent, raise the issue about your religious orientation and see how they feel about that. As long as it's not a secret. 

01:44:10
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:44:10
STEVEN FRANKEL Okay. All right. We'll take a break. It's now five of. I'll see you at 10 after.

STEVEN FRANKEL All right. Get ready, get set. We're going to talk about sex. 

01:45:00
UNKNOWN Woo! 

01:45:05
UNKNOWN All right! 

01:45:05
UNKNOWN Woo-hoo! 

01:45:10
STEVEN FRANKEL Sorry? Yes. Yeah. All fixed. Uhm, I love this slide. This is, this is a great slide. 

01:45:25
[sil.] 

01:45:30
STEVEN FRANKEL When we started this morning and I was giving you the, the general overview and I was going through the data on sex with patients, uhm, and I was talking about the lawsuits, I said that, that the 20% sex with patients, ah, issue with, with, uhm, malpractice suits is pretty similar to, to what's going on these days. And then I showed you data to show how many of us are having sex with patients. The reason that there is so much litigation and, and that the 20% back in 1989 was a little bit high is, is all the fault of Masters and Johnson. Ah, if you get my drift. Ah, what was happening--here's what happened. What happened was that in the sixties Masters and Johnson were doing research on sex, people with sexual dysfunctions. And, uhm, they--Masters and Johnson were not what we used to call sixties people. They, they didn't wear tie-dyed shirts and they didn't smoke dope and they didn't do all that stuff. They were straight and very serious researchers and they had a very serious topic to look at. And what happened was that in their research subject population what they discovered was that a substantial cohort of their research subjects who were sexually dysfunctional reported that they had had sexual relationships with their therapist. And Masters and Johnson went ballistic. They just went nuts. And they published a paper in the mid-seventies and in the paper they said that because the power balance is so out of whack between therapist and patients, any therapist that has sex with a patient should be prosecuted under a speci--special and specific code for rape because the issue of consent is not a possibility in therapy relationships. And what happened was that when that news hit the, hit the streets, and then when a case was decided in 1976 of a, of a, of a psychiatrist that, that lost his license--actually a psychologist--that lost his license. And, and that--the jury awarded in a, in a civil suit, the jury awarded an enormous amount of money to the patient who he had had sex with. What happened was that our professional societies all paid attention. And in the 1980's, when each of our professional societies revised the ethics codes, every one of our societies put in a specific prohibition against sex with patients. That then resulted in a flood of litigation. It opened up the floodgates. And we saw during the eighties an enormous amount of, ah, litigation for sex with patients. That's why that the, the data, the 20% figure is a little bit high. But that's how it all developed. So in the eighties, we became aware of it in a very powerful, public way. We did--our societies began to put in ethics codes proscribing it and there was a whole bunch of research that went on. And the research showed that 80% of the cases were male clinicians and female patients, 5% males with males, 2% females with males and 13% females with females and these ratios are the same today as they were back in the eighties. These, ah, estimates of, of, ah, these ratios have remained the same. The incidence rate, they, they used the wrong word. The incidence rate has stayed the same. The, the same number of us every year wind up having sex with our patients. The prevalence has gone down because there's more of us every year. But the absolute incidents has remained the same over the course of these years. Uhm, which is truly, really remarkable. What happened was that a variety of studies began to be done in the eighties to try to understand what harms befell the patients that had sex with their, their therapists. And the reason that the studies were triggered right away was that the major defense that was used by the therapists that had sex with their patients-- you, your patient accuses you of having sex, files a lawsuit against you, you, you admit, it's clear that, that you had sex. What's your defense? It didn't harm the patient because to win a lawsuit, you have to show that you broke a rule and that the breaking of that rule harmed somebody. The defense was it didn't harm my patient. My patient felt cared about, felt valued, felt special, felt attractive, felt loved, felt excited, felt, you know, didn't, didn't harm--those arguments failed. Didn't work. Uhm, and so--but they also started to result in studies that were done to look at harms. And this is the first that was done. This is a 1985 study. And the problem with this study and the next one I'm going to show you is that regardless of the fact that their data are, are pretty clear about what, what harms happen to people, they did not control for whether these patients were dysfunctional sexually before they saw the therapist to begin with. So it's not clear that the sex with the therapist caused the symptoms. What's clear is that they were symptomatic but it isn't clear from these studies whether the sex with the therapist caused the symptoms because what we know now is that a significant number of the patients who wind up having sex with their therapist, they're people who have childhood sex abuse. The pat--that patient population is vulnerable. And so if they're symptomatic sexually after they have sex with the therapist, it may not have been the therapist sex with them that caused the symptoms. It--they may have been symptomatic already. That was not controlled for in these studies. But nonetheless, the, the census of the harms are pretty similar. Ah, so what are the harms? Mistrust of therapists, question of your own sense of reality, repeating childhood trauma instead of resolving it, ah, being bonded to the therapist, I can't get him out of my head, ah, exacerbation of symptoms, constricted intimacy, all of these things are, are pretty much, ah, across the board, the kinds of complaints that we hear. Uhm, then, uhm, at--this is, ah, Pope and Bouhoutsos in 1986. The same kind of thing, ambivalence and isolation and emptiness and all this kind of stuff, sexual confusion, that kind of stuff. And then as we move through the eighties into the nineties, one of the things that we see in the data on harms is for the first-- I opened an office in southern California in 1974. I saw, I, I was there in that community until 2001 when I moved to northern California. And over the years my practice got more and more focused on trauma survivors but during the early two decades or so of my practice, it was very general. I, I, I was into Dr. Erickson. Ah, I did a lot of hypnosis. I did a lot of couples. I did a lot of families, uhm, a lot, a lot of that kind of general practice stuff and enjoyed it very much. Uhm, and what I found was that people who I saw first when they were children, part of a family, called me back when they were mid-adolescents, called me back when they were young adults. And some of them called me back when they were in relationships and had children of their own. And that's lost. That, the capacity to call somebody that you know, you knew, you trusted, who doesn't take a lot of training up time about you because they knew you when. They knew where you came from. Ah, that gets destroyed. And those--that kind of harm wasn't seen in the studies done in the early eighties but was seen in the studies that were done in the early nineties. Clinicians also are harmed, ah, those who are--those clinicians who are not psychopathic or, ah, ah, narcissistic beyond belief, who are maybe not harmable, but the rest of the clinicians that wind up doing this get, get-- you know some of those huh? Uhm, ah, aren't they fun to work with. Ah, the, the, the, ah, the clinicians who are not like that get significant harm. And it comes in a variety of ways. Our licenses are very much a part of our identities. Ah, I don't practice psychology. I am a psychologist. I, I, don't practice. I don't practice law. I am a lawyer. These are identities. They are parts of our identity. If you look--if we lose a license, it's, it's a major--bless you--assault on our identity. Uhm, we wind up feeling profound shame. Shame, ah, I mean, those of you who are trauma therapists know this. Ah, shame is in my view the most noxious emotional experience that humans can have. I'll show you what it looks like. It, it, it is, it is a, a feeling that is overwhelmingly horrifying because it comes with a message that the person who feels it is not worthy of being called human, is not, is not acceptable, is not of worth. Ah, it is a profoundly awful feeling, difficult to manage. And results in anger toward self, pushing self away and pushing others away. It's a big, big deal. Ah, so there's a lot of shame. There's a lot of financial--and, and your name is in, in the news, you know. It, it goes out. Ah, your professional society, your professional board sends around newsletters that says this person, sex, bad. Uhm, financial burdens because you can't make a living. Ah, I don't know if you know this but your malpractice insurance doesn't pay damages if you are in a lawsuit and you lose, ah, with a sex charge. And the reason is that sex with a patient causes damages that are not the result of malpractice. Let me see if I can explain. Uhm, malpractice in, in legal, in a legal mind means negligence, means you thought you knew what you were doing and you didn't do it right and something bad happened. Ah, sex with a patient doesn't occur by accident. It isn't like how, how did we get here. I mean that, that, that doesn't, that doesn't happen by accident. It can't happen by accident. It is, it is by intent. It is in the same class of legal activity as punching a patient in the mouth. It is something that happens by--with intent. Your malpractice insurance company will cover negligence where you make an error, well-intended but an error, and you harm somebody. It won't cover you for the damages when you punch a patient in the mouth or when you have sex with them. You pay it out of your own pocket. So they'll defend you but they won't pay the damages. Just thought I'd tell you that. I, I, I--part of my, my issue here is when, when I get done with this section on sex, you'll know a tremendous amount about how that happens, who it happens with, under what circumstances it happens, who's vulnerable, and all that kind of stuff. What we don't know is how to stop it. Ah, that's what we don't know. Real, real loud. Otherwise, you got to go to the mic. 

01:56:20
UNKNOWN What is the percentage of cases that were reported, ah, because the relationship went bad? 

01:56:25
STEVEN FRANKEL What--oh that's, that's very often when they get reported. The question is what's the percentage of cases that get reported like to the licensing board or a lawsuit or something like that because the relationship in general went bad. Uhm, overwhelming number of the cases because what happens typically is that it starts off as a therapy relationship. It morphs into a sexual relationship and all of a sudden, it's gone like that. Uhm, there's something horrible that happens. The patient says this is wrong. This is bad, or the therapist says I can't do this anymore, or, or they can't do anything else but that and it's, it's not going anywhere and it ends. And it ends typically abruptly. And there are some that don't end that way. There's a large number of marriages between therapists and patients that they've had sex with. Uhm, if you know New York and you know this psychoanalytic community in New York, there are a good number of psychoanalysts who have married their analysands. Ah, that's not just in New York. It's in other places as well. The--there are, there are stories of, of patients and therapists who actually do get married and have long stern--standing relationships or get married and then it blows out. Uhm, so--but the majority of complaints come when the relationship goes bad. The therapy goes bad because it's been corrupted. 

01:57:40
UNKNOWN Is it legal for them to marry? Is it permitted by societies in New York? 

01:57:45
STEVEN FRANKEL It's legal to marry in any state, not just New York. You don't, you don't break a law by getting married. You may break your bank or your heart but it may not break a law. There, there are ethics issues but there, there are not legal issues. Ma'am? 

01:58:05
UNKNOWN Besides touching, are you going to talk about can we still use sex surrogates? What happens if you view a couple doing sensate focus, you're not touching them but they're partially nude, that kind of thing? 

01:58:20
STEVEN FRANKEL I, I wasn't going to but I can. So, so let me get through this. 

01:58:25
UNKNOWN Okay. Wonderful. Thank you.

STEVEN FRANKEL Okay. So, so, so these are all the different kinds of things that happen to clinicians. Uhm, lives get, get profoundly messed up. There, there is a category of false allegations. Ah, Ken Pope back in, in the eighties wrote a paper--or actually early in the nineties--wrote a paper indicating that about 4% of the claims of therapists having sex with patients are false. We think it's a little bit higher now, uhm, than it, it was in, in the early 1990's. What's really important is the records keep--the recordkeeping stuff. It's really important because if you're documenting boundary issues in your recordkeeping, it's, it's a lot easier to protect yourself from false allegations. And false allegations are made. So if you're going to do--like right now I'm a forensic expert in a case in California where a professional was accused of having sexual contact with his patient. Uhm, and, and my job was to access the complainant. I'm, I'm brought in as an expert on the defense side. And I, I've assessed the complainant and part of what I've done is I followed this outline, which is a forensic assessment of a complaint. And what I'm looking for when I do the assessment is what is the patient's motivation for bringing this complaint? Is it revenge? Is it retaliation? Is it object retention? Object retention, he's never going to forget me. I got him forever. Uhm, competition with others, his wife wasn't as good. Ah, fantasy or distortion, delusions, extortions, financial gain, some, some escape from treatment actually. Ah, is the patient who's making the complaint borderline? It's over-- over-represented. This is a category of patients that's over-represented in those who file lawsuits. Uhm, and, and who claim sex with patients. Are there other factual evidence, uhm, considerations? Is the, is the report consistent? Is it plausible or implausible? It--what's the object choice of these people historically? Can the patient describe the therapist's body? Warts, moles, scars, textures, colors. Uhm, are they aware of things that they would not be aware of but for the fact that they had a sexual relationship? Ah, is there a historical of decep--deception, lying, fraud and so on. The other thing--this thing about indoctrination by subsequent treaters. Let me tell you, we, we in particular, mental health professionals, have a major problem that has to do with not just the usual schisms that you would predict in our, in our foundations, like psychiatrists are better than psychologists who are better than social workers who are better than MFCs who are better than counselors. Uhm, we got that. But we also have psychoanalysts and systems people and, and all--behaviorists and on and on and on. We all got that. And then we have a, we have a real difficult time with suspicion about our colleagues. We are not, we, we are not, uhm, kindly disposed towards colleagues a lot. Ah, when we see a new patient who tells us something terrible happened with a former therapist, our profession doesn't circle the wagon and aim at the patient. Our profession circles the wagon and aims at the therapist. And, and, and there's a psychologist in San Jose, ah, named Marty Williams who has done research on the number of board complaints against mental health professionals that are triggered by subsequent treaters. That's a lot. It's a lot. Subsequent treaters are a source, a major source, of board complaints. And what happens is that the therapist, the new therapist bonds to the patient by, by accepting and embracing the patient's story in a way that often is unthoughtful. Uhm, what I want to tell you about this is that in almost all of your states, there is no statute of limitations on a board action, no statute of limitations. California has a statute of limitations against a board action. It's to my knowledge, the only state that does. No other state has a statute of limitations on a licensing board action. What that means--the reason I'm telling you this is the patient has a lot of time to consider whether they want to make a board complaint. They don't have to make it as soon as they see the new therapist. You don't have to get outraged and say make a, make a board complaint. You get to know the patient really well because what you don't want is for the patient to be talking to the next therapist about you. So take your time. Uhm, there is a high rate of complaints that are made by subsequent treaters in our field. We are suspicious of each other. Uhm, so, so that's the kind of outline you follow. It's really important to understand that, that if, if you are doing anything resembling long-term death oriented therapies, uhm, you're in an intimate relationship. And intimate relationships are intimate both for us and for the patients that we serve. And that means that everybody's vulnerable. And, and that needs to be remembered. There's, there's no one who's absolutely un-impermeable, un--not in the vulnerability category someplace over the course of their careers. So here's the research. Uhm, all clinicians are vulnerable. Let me tell you what these, these groups mean. Ah, first of all, I used to know what neurotic meant but we don't use it anymore so I don't know what it means anymore Ah, but I can tell you what the naï¿½ve normal are. The naï¿½ve normal are students who get licenses and enter the field but in their training have never had any kind of training experiences with long-term death oriented therapies. They've been in short-term--if they're, if they're in facilities and they go to agencies, it's short-term, rapid turnaround, get them out, that kind of stuff. They haven't had the long-term death oriented kind of training and what that means is that they haven't had to confront during their training years the fact that they got feelings and the fact that the patient's got feelings and how do you deal with that. Uhm, it's--so that's a naï¿½ve normal group. And there's a substantial number of the people who wind up getting into sexual relationships that are in this naï¿½ve normal group. Uhm, the third line down, socially isolated. We know that colleagues who are at stages of their life where they are emotional affectively empathically disconnected, they're widowed, widowered, alone, in solo practice, no, no relationships really that are, that are nurturing and empathically connected to colleagues, friends, so on. That group is extraordinarily high risk. Uhm, we, we need, we need very much to maintain affective, empathic connections to, to people in our lives over the course of our lives, not only because it's a value and it helps us in all kinds of ways, but because it's prophylactic, uhm, when it comes to this kind of thing. So the socially isolated group is a high risk group. Ah, sociopaths and narcissists definitely, what else is new. Uhm, the, the medically disabled group do--if you look at a high risk group in general, it's senior colleagues, emotionally disconnected in their lives with medical complications in their lives. That group is really--is very, very high risk. We are seeing more and more senior colleagues, people who've been in practice for years and years and years and years and, ah, are in solo practice, have no connections to other people because of the circumstances of their lives, and have some sort of medical thing going on, very high risk group. Uhm, so these are the data from the mid-nineties on who are the most vulnerable colleagues of ours. 

02:06:15
UNKNOWN Who is the 75? I didn't get that. 

02:06:15
STEVEN FRANKEL Sorry? 

02:06:15
UNKNOWN I turned--I got as far as G-o-n, the writers of studies. 

02:06:20
STEVEN FRANKEL Ah, there are two, there are two studies. One is Gonsiorek-- if you get the book that I've, that I've recommended, the, the boundary book . . . 

02:06:25
UNKNOWN Oh, okay. 

02:06:30
STEVEN FRANKEL That boundary book contains all of this stuff. 

02:06:30
UNKNOWN Oh, okay. 

02:06:35
STEVEN FRANKEL Okay. 

02:06:35
UNKNOWN How many sex offenders of all the clinicians because sex offenders don't get licenses? 

02:06:40
STEVEN FRANKEL Uhm . . . 

02:06:45
UNKNOWN Hopefully. 

02:06:45
STEVEN FRANKEL There, there are, there are some, there are some licensed people who wind up being sex offenders. And, ah . . . 

02:06:55
UNKNOWN They wind up being sex offenders. 

02:06:55
STEVEN FRANKEL And they wind up, and they, there's a, there are, there are sex offenders who wind up going into rehab with others. And wind up being sort of acting as clinicians. And they are a very vulnerable group. All right. So, uhm, I told you before that there is a test, the psychological test or psychiatric test actually, that was developed in the early nineties at the Meunier Clinic, ah, for, for--that, that had two purposes. It, it was standardized on psychiatric residents. It is still given to psychiatric residents. And it has been shown to--and it's, and it's not given in the sense that I'm the test giver and I sit there and ask you questions and you answer them. This is self-reflexivity. This is about getting to know yourself. This is about paying attention to yourself. Uhm, and, and they take this test and what they've done is they've done published research on how the test predicts risks for the psychiatric residents. And I have the test. You can get it online for free if you, if you type in Exploitation Index, that's what it's called. It's called the Exploitation Index and you can download it. I have it. In fact, I, I may just show it to you in a minute. But the categories of the questions--so, so it's 32 self-assessment questions. You read the question and then you answer the question how often is this true about me. And the questions are grouped in a factor analysis--analytic way into categories. So the first one is generalized boundary violations. Uhm, those questions are about how blurry am I? Do I, do I blur by talking about my patients with my family and my friends even if I keep their identities protected? Uhm, do I talk about my family and friends with my patients? How, how blurry a guy am I kind of thing. So that's, that's the first category. Eroticism is the second. Uhm, self-gratifying romantic feelings about a patient. And again, it's not to you ever have any, it's how often do you have them and how, how much do you have them. Ah, exhibitions and boasting or otherwise attaining personal gratification of the patient's accomplishments or notoriety. Some of you may remember the morning after Nicole Brown Simpson was murdered, a therapist in L.A. went public about the fact that she was Nicole Brown Simpson's therapist. And the licensing board didn't wait for a complaint. They jumped on her license right away. Ah, this therapist also was the publisher and writer of self-help books and, ah, was, was known in that domain in, in, in California. Ah, and this is exactly where that falls. It, it falls in the, ah, getting personal and financial gratification from a patient's notoriety. Ah, dependency, needing a patient to continue in therapy to give emotional support to the clinician. This turns out to be a big deal. Ah, and if you think about clinicians who are isolated and cut off, ah, this is, this is a very big deal for that. Ah, power seeking, need for mastery, control, ah, greed, ah, and finally and if, and if you any of you have any experience like I do with trauma therapy, trauma therap--remember the nineties, trauma therapists were getting slaughtered in courts? During the nineties, there were, there were unbelievable numbers of lawsuits against trauma therapists. They were take--those who work with dissociative disorders had child alters in a body sitting in their lap, reading to the child alter in adult body. I mean, it was, it was wild. Uhm, what this is about is rescue stuff. Most, most of us, we come to this field because part of us is about rescuing. I mean that's just the way reality works for us. There's a--we have a thread of one sort of another in us that's about helping people with problems. And as that thread is more and more powerful, it becomes more and more about rescuing and it takes a good while for us to be able to really feel comfortable with the fact that we can have those feelings and not get caught up in boundary problems. Uhm, and, and those of us who, who do that kind of work know that there's limits. I have clients who have--legal clients--who have gone over those lines and, and have done things that have been profound bout--boundary violations that have begun by rescuing attempts. Uhm, I have two clients who allowed patients to sleep in their houses. Uhm, one outside their bedroom on the floor. I mean, that kind of stuff. Ah, because the client was homeless, ah, kind of thing. It--there's limits to the rescuing that we can do. So, so and, and this rescuing thing happens a lot with people that we wind up feeling something very special for. So let me show you the Exploitation Index. Actually, let me do that later. Let me do this now. 

02:11:45
[sil.] 

02:11:50
STEVEN FRANKEL Okay. You want to start there huh? I don't want you to start there. 

02:12:00
[sil.] 

02:12:20
STEVEN FRANKEL The vulnerable patients fall into these categories, everybody's vulnerable first of all. Ah, those with current loses, marker events in their lives, ah, anniversary reactions, all kinds of stuff like that, developmental turmoil, ah, relationship loss, isolation, medical illness, abus--history of, of abuse, incest, ah, substance abuse histories and borderline of course, ah, disorders appear here. So these are the vulnerable patients especially. All right. So, so that's what I wanted to tell you about sex. Uhm, we know a tremendous am--amount now about what the vulnerability factors are. We know what is needed to be able to help ourselves with it. The evidence is that like what most of us learned in our introductory psychology courses, psychology is the science of understanding, predicting and controlling behavior. We're really good at understanding and we're really good at predicting. We're lousy at controlling. We're, we're lousy in terms of trying to make this stuff not happen. The absolute frequency of these things is consistent year after year after year, state after state after state, ah, probably country after country after country. And it isn't all psychopaths and narcissists. It's not. It's, it's people who have certain kinds of vulnerabilities that need to be-- pay attention and need to be in connection with colleagues. When, when I get to some of the prophylactic stuff, I want to talk about later, one of the things I'll tell you is about, uhm, the importance of peer consultation. It's really important and helpful to have peer consultation. It's even better if it's not just peer consultation but if there's a, a designated leader to the consultation group. Uhm, for private practitioners, I, I, I speak from some experience. When I moved to northern California in 2001, I had already established two groups of trauma therapists with whom I meet monthly and I've been meeting monthly with, with a group in Oakland and a group in Davis since January of 1999. And we meet once a month and I assign two papers to read in the trauma therapy literature and we meet one group--the Oakland group is smaller and meets for an hour and a half. The David group meets for two and a half hours and we meet on the fourth Fridays of each month and we talk about the papers and we talk about patients and we've gotten to know each other very, very well and it's been a place where--and, and we don't name patients' names and we don't follow cases over a long period of time. We don't do things that would get us into trouble in terms of anybody firing at us about being supervisors. We're not. We're, we're consultants. And I'll tell you about that later when we get to that topic, about how to be a consultant and protect yourself and protect your consultant from legal liability for the consultation relationship because consultants generally are not liable but supervisors are. And I'll, I'll give you an example of the way that courts decide whether a given professional is a consultant as opposed to a supervisor so that you can know what that, what that's about. Uhm, the most important ingredient I think I can tell you, which I've told you, I'll you again over and over again, in protecting yourselves from these kinds of boundary violations has to do with making sure that you're connected to yourself. The more connected you are to yourself, the more self-reflexive you are, the more you are willing to document, uhm, issues that come up between you and patients that are boundary issues, the safer you are going to be and the safer you're patients are going to be. So let's look at nonsexual boundary issues. Uhm, Neils Bohr had won eight Nobel Prizes in his, in his life. Uhm, so let me, let me, let me go back and, and tell you, remind you of a story that I told you. I told you that a guy saw a, a patient and, uhm, let her park his--her car in his garage and used it and so on. Mem--remember that story? Well, when the board acted against him and said this was a, an unethical dual relationship, it--the board did that because it had an expert who was a colleague, has the same license that the guy--that the, the client of mine had, and that colleague did an analysis of that relationship that he had with the patient whose car he book--he let store in his garage. And it was that expert who decided for the board that this was an unethical dual relationship and he did that by using an analysis that I'm now going to show you. The analysis was created, was developed by a friend of mine, a guy who I know very well. I've known for about 40 years. We lived in the same community. Our kids went to the same schools. So I've been on committees with him. His name is Jeff Youngrin. And he is, ah, a very senior psychologist who also is a--we're friendly. We're not good buds, but we're friendly. And, and we have very different world views. Jeff is a retired full-bird colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. I am, shall we say, not a retired full-bird colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. In fact, if I were to make a true confession as to when I allowed Indiana University to grant my doctoral degree, it was two weeks after my 26th birthday, at which point--when I turned 26, I was no longer eligible to be--for the draft. I-- and so, I, I like that better than going to Canada myself. Uhm, so I'm going, I'm going to show you Jeff's analysis. And I want you to see where the analysis begins. Is the dual relationship necessary? Now I ask you, aside from the relationship between a parent and child, what relationship is necessary? You can bet that anybody who uses Jeff's analysis is not going to find any relationship that's going to pass muster if it begins with that question. Any relationship that's dual relationship hasn't got a pray of surviving this analysis because of where Jeff starts. So he starts there. Is it necessary? Is it exploitive? Who does it benefit? Is there risk that the dual relationship could damage the patient? Is there a risk that could dam--could disrupt the therapy? Am I--the therapist, am I being objective in my evaluation? Have I adequately documented the decision-making process in the treatment records. And did the client give informed consent? The guy I represented who lost his license in this, in this case because he used the woman's car, uhm, and stored it in his garage and so on, uhm, documented everything in the notes. And he documented every one of these conversations about should he take the car and should she give it blah, blah, blah. Ah, and documented that he had a personal interest in, in having the car there. He did all that. But it doesn't matter. Because with this analysis, the relationship couldn't survive. So this analysis resulted in the expert's opinion that this was an unethical dual relationship. Since I'm the defense lawyer, I have to go out and find another expert who might see it differently. And so I went to a woman named Jan Sunny. Jan is a psychologist who practices in southern California who is an award-winning nat--nationwide award-winning psychologist in the issue of boundaries. She does a lot of work for the board and so they know her and they, they respect. I respect her. I asked her to take a look at this. Now I will tell you in all candor that, that because I've had 30 years of being a trauma therapist, I, I have come to the clear conclusion that women are far more, far more nuanced than men. Uhm, I think that that's just true. And, and as an example of the truth of that, you're looking at Jeff's analysis which takes one page, one slide. I had everything in my--I had, I had to do everything in my power to get Jan's analysis onto two slides. You'll see how nuanced Jan's analysis is. Now she says, I want to look at therapist factors, client factors and relationship factors. I want to look at the therapist statistical sensitivity, did the therapist see this as an ethics issue? Ah, did the, did--was the therapist willing to expend cognitive effort? Uhm, was the therapist aware of the guiding principles about not doing any harm? What's the gender relationship between the therapist and the patient? What's the cultural relationship? What's the religious, spirituality relationship, if any? Uhm, what's the therapist's professional identi--identification, theoretical orientation, years of experience, character? What are the patient's psychosocial strengths and vulnerabilities? Do they have a history of prior boundary violations? What's the nature of their relationship, the power differential? Blah, blah, blah, all of that, and more. Clarity to change and the nature and function of the relationship, professional's motivation for engaging pat--patient's, professional's affective response, role conflict, benefit, blah, blah, blah, all that stuff, okay. Jan. Good. So, so Jan comes back to me and she says you know what? I'll tell you what I think. But I have to tell you what I think, I don't know what you think, but I'll tell you what I think. I said I don't--what I think isn't important. What's important is what you tell me. Ah, so tell me the truth cuz I don't, I don't bring experts on just to sort of say what I want them to say. I, I bring them on because I want to know what they think. And Jan says, this is a 50/50 judgment call. Uhm, he's right on the cusp. Ah, it could, it could go either way. I don't see this as, as, as clearly an unethical dual relationship but I also don't see it clearly as a not unethical dual relationship. It's right on the borderline. And I said great. And let me tell you why I said great. And it has to do with the standards that boards have to use and meet in order to be able to take action against one of us. If we're in criminal court and I'm, I am accused of murdering somebody and you're in the jury and you hear all of the evidence, how confident do you have to be that the evidence shows that I am guilty? What is the standard? It is beyond a reasonable doubt, 99% sure. Why is that 99% sure? It's because if you are wrong, I lose liberty at least and in some states life. And life and liberty to say nothing of pursuit of happiness, are things that we, we absolutely value in our society. And so wrongfully taking someone and convicting them of a, of a crime where they have to lose liberty and potentially life is a very serious matter and so the criterion is 99% sure that they did it. Beyond a reasonable doubt. Okay, so let's now go to civ--civil court. Let's say that somebody, ah, ah, crashes into my car and I want to sue them for damages. How--what standard do I have to convince the jury that they did this bad thing to me in order to be able to win money? And the answer is 51%. It's called the preponderance of the evidence. I have to show that it is more likely than not that they did something wrong. Why is it that low? It's because if they make a mistake, it's only money. It's not life and liberty. It's money. Not so, not so big a, a problem. What evidence, what confidence level does a licensing board have to meet in its evidence to take a person's license? It is called clear and convincing. It is not beyond a reasonable doubt. It is not preponderance of the evidence. It is 75% sure, clear and convincing. That's what a licensing board uses. So when Jan tells me this is a 50/50 judgment call, it could go either way, I'm happy cuz I now have evidence that I can use Jan's testimony and--who's well-known to the board and makes a very powerful case that this isn't such a clear issue of him being, ah, over the line. And then I do the next thing I have to do as a defense lawyer. I have to find out how serious the board is in its intent to act against this, this licensed person. So I called the deputy attorney general who represents the board and I say, okay, I got an expert who's going to say this. That's nowhere near the 75% confidence level that the board requires and I know that the board's expert says definitely 75%. But we've got room to talk here. How serious is the board if, if we went to hearing and the judge, the administrative law judge who hears the case, decided that my client didn't do wrong, didn't at--didn't meet the 75% threshold, what's the board going to do? And the deputy attorney general said take his license. What I just told you is that a licensing board is the final arbiter. An administrative law judge who makes a decision doesn't make a decision. They make what's called a recommended decision. The board gets to recommend a decision and decides whether to adopt it or not adopt it. And that's in states where the board doesn't do the hearing itself. In some states, they're called small states. Small means not as many mental health professionals as big states. In small states, the board does this all by itself. Ah, does the hearing itself, does the ruling itself. In big states, an administrative law judge does, does the hearing and writes a, a recommended decision and it's up to the board to adopt it or not adopt it. And what this person told me was, the board was not going to adopt a decision that was anything but revoke. And it made no sense to go to the hearing. It made no sense, ah, because he would, he would lose no matter what. And so that's what happened. And I'll tell you more about this later. If you come back this afternoon, I'm going to spend some time talking about boards and how they operate and what you need to know. So this is Jan's assessment, which was wonderful and helpful and, and intellectual ways but didn't help legally. Other non--nonsexual boundary issues. Ah, money, services and gifts. Boards are very, very sensitive to fraud. Very sensitive to this first thing called colluding with a patient to fraudulent bill insurance. I'm going to make sure you're insurance does really well for you. I'm going to make this a parity case. I'm going to give you the serious diagnosis so that you can get more money and more support from your insurance company. We're going to use a, a higher level of, of involvement so that you can get the most you can get out of your insurance company even though your true diagnosis wouldn't merit that. That's called insurance fraud. We call that being nice. The insurance company and our boards call that being fraudulent. Uhm, it's--and it's, and it's very serious kind of thing that a board will react strongly to. Ah, issue of sliding scales. We are allowed to use sliding scales. It's not uncommon in our field to use sliding scales. Uhm, the, the worry when you use sliding scales has to do with people for whom you do not slide the scale finding out that they're people for whom you did slide the scale and getting upset with you. Ah, that's the kind of thing that has happened that has made some clinicians really unhappy because the one who didn't get the scale slid gets enraged when they find out that the--you are willing to slide scales. But there's nothing unethical or wrong about sliding a scale. What you will be held do is a standard of documenting what convinced you that you should slide the scale down for this person. You don't have to insist on seeing their IRS returns. What you do have to do is question them about what's going on with them financially and document that you've done that analysis in your records so that you can show that you have slid the scale properly in a proper case. Uhm, the issue of limit setting with respect to payment is, is no longer a big issue for most of us. Most of us have in our informed consent, uhm, I expect you to pay when I--when you see me. Ah, if you don't pay by the third session, there isn't a fourth session. However you do it. Ah, being really clear about what the limits are in terms of payment is really important and sticking to it, not changing your policy because you like the person a lot. After three years, they can't pay you at all. It's important that, that you stay with your policies. Uhm, I already told you the insider information talk. Let me talk about bartering. I had a call from a, a psychologist in southern California who said, I've been treating a woman for two years and she and her husband both lost their jobs in this economy and she's very resourceful. Uhm, and she has started to knit sweaters and sell them at flea markets and she's getting $60 a pop for her sweaters. And she wants to know whether I'll accept sweaters for payment because she doesn't have any money. And I said well, there's no ethics problem about your accepting some sort of barter system. The, the questions I got though are how, how long do you think you're going to be seeing her? And how, how frequently are you going to be seeing her during that period? And how many sweaters do you want? What'd you, what'd you going to do? You're going to see her for two more years. That's what she said, two years. I said how frequently? Well at least once every other week if not every week. So let's count sweaters. Are you going to sell them at flea markets too? I mean what are you going to do with the sweaters? So, so the two problems with bartering is you can't barter for services. You can't have them become your secretary. You can't have their brother be your gardener. You, you can't barter for services because what if your unhappy with the service? It, it doesn't, it doesn't work. So you, you can only bargain--barter for goods. But how many goods do--are-- how many goods and, and how--what kind of goods meet whatever your fee is. So barter is acceptable ethically. It's just that it's difficult. It's got major difficulties that go with it. Ah, if you're in rural communities, there are times where bartering works fairly effectively. Uhm, ah, because certain goods you might need. Uhm, so there might be a corn crop, stuff that, that you, that you would consume, not sweaters. And then comes gifts. It's interesting, when I did this in Missouri, I did one of these in Springfield, Missouri. And when I said wha--what I'm about to say, I got shock, ah, from the audience. Our, our fields do not object to us, on ethical grounds, accepting gifts from patients. There isn't an objection in our field for accepting gifts. There are--that realization that one of the people in Missouri to say that's a dual relationship. Uhm, okay, maybe. But that's a decision that everybody gets to make. Uhm, there are--there's an organization, one organization I've found that has a policy, a firm policy about not accepting--no line clinician can accept a gift for, for--worth more than $25 and that's Kaiser. Uhm, without supervisor's approval. To--from my perspective, it's not such much what is the value of the gift, although there are limits which I'll describe in a second. It's not so much the monetary value of the gift, it's what it means. I mean, what's important about a gift is not how much it's worth, it's what it means. And so let me give you a couple of examples. One of my dissociative patients comes in one day and there is obviously a child part of her that's, that's in the body and she's carrying a brown wooden highly polished box about that big by that big. It's, it's small box, wooden box. And she says, if you can open it, you can have it. I said, okay. And I went to open it. And it didn't open. And I turned it around and I went to open it and it didn't open. And I tried all four sides and it didn't open. And then I thought well, maybe it slides. So I pushed it sideways, it didn't open. And I pushed it the other side sideways. It didn't open. And then I thought maybe there's a catch inside. If I squeeze it, the swatch--the catch will spring and then can open it. I squeezed it and nothing happens. And she's, she's going . . . And then because I'm human, I shake it, right. Like what's it going to tell me if I shake it? Ah, and she's laughing hysterically. And finally I, I I have one more idea to try and what I try is I hold it diagonally and push the lid across diagonally and it slides open. And she says you can have it. And I said, thanks for reminding me how counterintuitive I have to be to work with you. Uhm, and that was indeed what it meant. That--what it meant was I'm a complicated person and you need to keep that in mind. And if you keep that in mind, we'll do good. And if you don't, we're not going to do good. Ah, it sits on my credenza. It's the same color wood as my credenza is and most people don't even see it. But she sees it. Uhm, so I'll tell you another gift. I have, I have permission to tell you all these stories. But it was at one of these conferences, there was a strong reaction that somebody had that I was telling stories about real patients that you could identify if you Googled them cuz of the information I'm giving. I have permission to tell you everything I'm telling you. Uhm, I treat a woman who is 75 years old. I treat her pro bono. I have now treated her for 20 years. She's dissociative. Uhm, and when--and she, she's living in Section 8 housing and she barely gets by financially. Uhm, and she has a dog. That is the one indulgence in her life. She has a dog. And she has lots of child parts inside of her. Most, most of her are now, are now integrated but there are some left. Uhm, I began to see her in southern California when we both lived in the same geographic area and then she moved to northern California but not where I did--was and slowly she moved close--it turns out-- closer to where I am. And so she comes in once a week and I see her without charge. She is a woman who was born in the Midwest, uhm, in a highly abusive family. Her mother, her mother abused her. Her father abused her. To escape them, she, ah, moved into the convent. Guess what? Priest and nuns abused her. Ah, she developed dissociative disorder and with all that baggage, she who is now 75, got two master degrees. She got a master's degree in computer science and a master's degree in physics. Now if you know something about women and the history of women in education, you know that a woman who is now 75 who got those two master degrees at the age-appropriate time in her life with that kind of history has to be remarkably bright and remarkably achieving. And she is all of that. Uhm, I, I really admire and respect her. And, and she does very well in, in treatment. Uhm, when she was doing well in life before she fell apart completely, she made a living, very nice living, as a computer consultant to the aerospace industry and her primary function was to debug the computer programs that the aerospace industry was using to keep satellites from falling on us. That's what she did. And she traveled the world and whenever she traveled the world, she bought stuff and she currently has a whole bunch of stuff from her travels. She has been in Papua New Guinea. She's been to Tibet. She bought a bunch of tapestries in Tibet that are now worth about two grand a pop and she has about a dozen of them and they're in storage. Ah, and here's what she does. She, she brings me on occasion coupons in case I want something that she has a coupon for, I can get it cheaper. 

02:35:55
UNKNOWN Aww. 

02:36:00
STEVEN FRANKEL I have a daughter who is born during the period of time I saw her and she's never seen my daughter but she's bonded to her and every year around my daughter's birthday time, she goes to a library who gives away books--that gives away books and she brings books that she thinks my daughter--she knows nothing about her--might like and she gives them to me for my daughter. Uhm, and she used to bring me, uhm, Afghan or Pakistani or Indian pumpkin bread cuz she knows that I like it. But I've been on the Atkins Diet and I can't eat it anymore so she can't bring me that. So, so we have this conversation that goes why are you giving me the coupons and the books? And, and why are you giving me these things? And she said oh, it's pretty simple actually. It's because I, I have to be a person of value. And I say, am I not showing that you're a value? And she says, no stupid. My patients sometimes call me things like Dr. Dense. No, it's not about you. It's about me. I have to feel like I am of value. And this is the way I express that. And I said thanks. Uhm, and we talked about that a bunch. And then one day as she's walking out the door she says and when I'm dead, you're going to get the Tibetan tapestries. 

02:37:25
UNKNOWN Aww. 

02:37:25
STEVEN FRANKEL And I said, no I'm not. And she said, why not? I said, then my lawyer alter said, I can't have an interest in your death. 

02:37:40
[sil.] 

02:37:45
STEVEN FRANKEL My psychologist alter would say, I can't benefit from your death in any way. Any way of that kind of substance. And she said, why not? She says I have no one in the world. I have no relatives. I have no family. I have no friends. I have a dog. Uhm, I know you don't want the dog. It's okay. I, I made other arrangements. I'm 75. I outlived both of my parents. I have no idea how much longer I've got. You've been kind to me beyond belief and why shouldn't you have the tapestries? And what I said was, look there have been many times over the course of our work together when you have been acutely suicidal. And at times where you've been a chronically low-grade suicidal and do you think I could live with myself if there was any possibility that your life ended at your own hands, by your own will. There's not a chance so just forget it. And she walked out the door muttering it'll be delivered to you when I'm dead, don't worry about it. I said it better be delivered with a paper that says which charity you want me to send them to cuz they're going to a charity. So it was an interesting conversation. Uhm, but I'm not going to take them. There's a doz--there's a dozen of them and they're worth two grand a pop and I'm not going to take them. What I, what I don't tell her and won't tell her is that if she sold them and wanted to pay me for her therapy that would be okay. I would accept that. But I won't take the tapestries. Ah, I won't. So, so that's the thing that I wanted to say about gifts. It's, it's not, it's not about how much they value within, within reason. It's about what they mean. And the discussion of what they mean is critically important because it has a lot to do with what the hell's going on inside these folks and what's going on with us. So I'll tell you one more gift story that happened to one of my pat--one of my colleagues in one of my study groups. Uhm, I told you I meet monthly with a study group in Oakland and Davis. And one, one of the therapists in the Davis study group walks in one day and she's got a bag about this big in her arms and she puts it down and she says I gotta question for you guys. Uhm, I have some little things in my office that are gifts that patients have given me over the years and I, I keep them in the office. And I've been seeing a new patient for about six months and she came in the other day bringing this and she said I wove this for you out of all the colors I've ever seen you wear. 

02:40:00
UNKNOWN Wow. 

02:40:00
STEVEN FRANKEL Oh, that's so sweet. And then she opened it and it's bigger than this screen. 

02:40:10
UNKNOWN Oh my. 

02:40:10
STEVEN FRANKEL It's, it's, it's enormous. It is enormous. It would cover this third of the wall. And she said, I don't know what to do with this. Uhm, it dom--it would dominate the office so I don't know what to do with it. So we talked about it as a group. And what we--the first question out of my mouth was how much narcissistic Axis II disorder does this lady have? Ah, and it turns out that that's seems to be a big piece of the problem. And so what the clinician decided to do after talking about it with us at some length was to say that, uhm, she would not keep it in the office, that she would take it home because it didn't fit in the office but she was appreciative and to expect all hell to break lose, which is exactly what happened. And they had a long talk about what it meant and why it was this big and all that kind of stuff. And she was actually able to have the conversation and with somebody who's that narcissistic to be able to have that conversation is huge. So that went well. So what mean--what gifts mean becomes something really important. Uhm, I became interested in the issue of self-disclosure. And, and we're going to talk about Facebook in a few minutes. We're going to talk about social networking in a few minutes cuz it's part of the self-disclosure stuff. Uhm, when I became interested in it-- during the seventies, from 68 to 79, I was a full-time professor at U.S.C. I was Director of Clinical Training in the Psychology Department. And during that period of time, self-disclosure was considered a therapeutic tool of considerable import and of considerable impact. Uhm, there was a book called The Transparent Self. There was a lot of stuff going on about self-disclosure as a clinical tool. And the pendulum has swung way over and back into be careful about self-disclosure. And I had a conversation with one of you at the break that's, that's going to be reminiscent of something I'm going to talk about in a minute. Uhm, and here's what happened. I got--about five years ago, I got called into the defense side consulting attorney on a case of malpractice claim by a patient against his therapist. The therapist had seen the patient for three years and something happened and they had a falling out and the therap--the patient went and got a lawyer who was willing to sue the therapist in California. And this is a lawyer who specializes in suing therapists. And because you can't make a lot of money by suing one of us, he sues as many of us as he can. And, and I don't know how you'd feel about this if you were the lawyer but his name is John Winer. There's certain cosmic things that happen in life to me. Anyway, he has a website. This is how you sue a therapist. What he likes are cases where a therapist can be seen as having made a patient dependent on the therapist and then has exploited the patient. As part of the paperwork that I reviewed in, in being the defense consultant, I, I saw a page, a paper that was written by the patient. It was single-spaced typewritten and it had a list of everything that the therap--that the patient had learned about the therapist personally in the three years that they were doing therapy together. Single-spaced typewritten, 12 pages long. And it included things like the therapist's bicep size. And I'm reading this stuff and I'm thinking, as my 15-year old daughter would say, WTF! Ah, it was . . . If you don't know what that means, it's good that you don't have an adolescent in your house. Uhm, what's going on? Was this guy blabbing about himself for three--for all the three years that they were in therapy together? And what is this? And so because I'm on the defense team, I get to sit with the therapist and, and I go through this document and said can I ask you about this stuff, these disclosures? And he said sure. And I said well let's start with your bicep size. What, what relevance is that do the therapy? And he says oh I thought you were going to start with a hard one. That's easy. He said, I'm a cognitive behavior therapist and I'm doing work with this patient who's depressed and I was extolling the virtues of exercise. And, and I said exercise is really good for us with--even if we're not depressed. But if we're depressed, it's really good. You get up earlier in the day. You start the day. You don't lose as much energy. Uhm, it makes your head smaller, your waist smaller. It makes your biceps bigger, you know. My head was like this before and now I'm, I'm, I've calmed down and take myself less seriously and my waist is in here and my bicep is there and it's good for every part of me. And I said all right. Okay. And we went through this entire list of items on the 12 pages and for every one he had an adequate at some level explanation for why it was there. And what I realized was that the attorney teaches his plaintiff patients, his plaintiff clients to write borderline documents, to take things out of context and make them fill the field, as if they were so big and awful that anybody would see how big and awful that they were. And that's what this guy does with all his clients. He, he teaches them how to write a borderline document that way. And so I became interested in what, what do patients really know about us. And, and what do we disclose and what's available without our disclosures. And with the internet, there's a lot available. I mean, there's, there's tremendous amount about us that's available. Uhm, so hang on, so I came up with this--these ideas. Uhm, back in 1991, Constance Dalenberg wrote a book called Countertransference and the Treatment of Trauma. Constance is brilliant. One of--she's the second smartest person I've ever met in my whole life. Uhm, she's really smart. She's a psychology professor at, ah, CSPP in, in Alliant International whatever it is this year in southern California, in San Diego. She wrote this book on countertransference and trauma treatment which is brilliant. And one of the things that she talks about--and I read it when it came out in 1991--and one of the things that she talks about is what happens when your patient starts to attribute things to you that may or may not be true, you know. So I have patients who often say to me something going on with you today? Something going on? You, you got something happening in your life? You're, you're different today. And before I read the book, I would say things like no, I'm doing fine. Something going on with you? Uhm, cuz it was pretty much projections. And I would treat them that way. But once I read Connie's book, I, I changed and I began to say things like what am I sending? What are you picking up? And while they're telling me what they're picking up, I'm thinking is something going on? And is something going on that I can actually share or is something going on that I can't? And if there's something going on that I can share, I'll share it but if there's something going on that I can't share, I'll, I'll say something like well, you know, I may be tense today because I'm a person and I have things going on in my life. I can't talk about them but the fact of the matter is I'm okay to work today. I'm fine at work. So let's go ahead. My favorite PTSDer with an Axis II big B disorder says things like this is really probably about me but is something going on with you today? I love it. So, so I've learned to validate observations by, by patients, ah, when they, when they made observations, ah, in, in ways that I think are helpful. Ah, I've already talked about disclosing to different types of patients. Ah, I didn't tell my physicians about my fall from the ladder. Coerced self-disclosure, this is the, the psychological version of I'll tell you mine if you'll tell me yours. Uhm, I had a--my favorite PTSDer with Axis II-B disorder came in one day and said something happened that I really want to talk with you about but before I tell you how I reacted, I want to tell you what it was that happened and see how you would have reacted cuz I want to see how a sane person would handle this. And I said, no, no. That's, that's not a deal I'm willing to make. Well why not? Because the way that you make that deal gives me no option except to tell you how I would have reacted and not knowing what it is, I don't even know if I would have anything near that experience. And it feel sort of coerced. If, if I have a reaction that I can share with you, I will but why don't you tell me what happened. Stop this extortion stuff. Uhm, so coerced self-disclosure is something that happens that we have to watch out for. And then exploring spontaneous self-disclosures. I already told you one where I said something nasty and hurtful to her because of my computer problem. Uhm, but let me, let me tell you another, ah, one. This particular patient who's my favorite PTSDer with an Axis II-B disorder, uhm, is very good at knowing when I'm not set. She has radar for that. So one day she comes in and I'm not set and she comes--as she comes in the door, she says have you heard what we're doing in Haiti? We're taking their babies. We're stealing their children. We're doing our American thing. Have you heard that? It's not in the popular media. And like a jerk, I responded to the content rather than what's up with you. And I said, yeah I think I heard it. Well it's not in the popular media. Where did you hear it? And I said probably in the Huffington Post. Huffington Post? That's way too liberal for you. And my first thought was shut the hell up. And my second thought was I've seen this lady for seven years at this point in time when this happened and she still doesn't know where I am politically, good boundaries. I'll take it. Uhm, so spontaneous self-disclosures are things that happen when--for me, when I'm not set. And so since I have somebody with radar for when I'm not set, I try really hard to get as set as best I can before anybody comes in the door. Then there's issues about shared affiliations and experiences. And this came up with one of you. Uhm, I did one of these in Sacramento and there was a woman in the audience who was a native American and who was in a tribe and most of her pat--she's an LCSW--and most of her patients are her, her fellow tribe's people. And one of the things she said is that she was concerned that periodically her tribe has meetings like a sweat lodge kind of deal and she sits with her colleagues, her, her, her fellows-- fellows in, in, in this meeting and is one of the members of the group and has to disclose like everybody else about her personal life and what's going on with her and her husband and this and that and, and she's not sure that's okay when she has people who are her patients sitting in the same space that she's in. So we talked about it for a while and I was, I was reminded that, that when I first opened my practice in 1974, it was in a small and insular community in southern California and it became clear that I was going to be running into my patients and their families cuz I saw a lot of families, ah, on the streets, in the bank and in Safeway and all over the place and that I needed to be able to find a way to deal with that. And so I would make as a part of my informed consent we're likely to run into each other out there in the world and if we do my, my practice is basically to smile, nod and walk, walk on and do my business, unless you want something else in which case I want you to talk about that with me. The only thing that I request that you not do is blurt out is oh, here comes my Steve Frankel, my therapist. I, I, that, that would not be a good idea. And everybody respected that. And so I began talking with her about when she sees somebody in fo--who becomes a therapy patient of hers that that's part of the informed consent. We're going to be meeting in the sam--in this, in this room, we're going to be talking, I'm going to be making personal statements, let's talk about how that's going to work. Uhm, and in small and rural and other insular communities, there are certain spiritual communities that are insular because there aren't a lot of churches of it around so if you meet somebody that's in it and you're in it, uhm, or some spiritual orientation that becomes an issue. It's really important to take care of all that stuff in informed consent and, and go that route. Uhm, so that's, ah, shared experiences and affiliations. Then the childhood trauma survivors. Ah, interestingly enough, the authors of the book that I've been recommending to you today, ah, Gutheil and Brodsky, say out loud that childhood trauma survivors need a little bit more flexibility in disclosures than others because they were raised by people who behaved one way during the day and one--another way at night. And, and they need to know who you really are in, in a way that they can feel safer with. And I had something right about that thing happen. Uhm, one of my patients came in and, and in the course of conversation, she mentioned by first and last names, the name of my older daughter and her husband. Neither of whom have my name. Uhm, I have two kids, one is 15 and one is 40. Every 25 years whether I need to or not, I father a child. I've got, I've got 10 years to go and I'll be ready in case you know anyone, anybody who wants a girl. I do girls only. I, I do. Uhm, so this, this patient comes in and she, she--and, and I have nothing in my office that, that gives the names out, nothing. And so my response to her mentioning the names of my adult daughter and her husband was okay, let's talk about snooping. Who's doing the snooping? And she--here's what she says. She says I'm going to tell you something that I don't know if any of your other patients have told you but I'm sure it's true for every one of them and it's true for me. I have to know whether you--who you seem to be and whether you're who you say you are because I was raised by people who are not who they say they were and not who they presented as being and I will stop at nothing to find out if you are indeed who you seem to be. End of story. I said knock yourself out. Uhm, I had another patient who walked in and said you own property in Sonoma County. Where, where is it? And I said none of your business. I--what I said was as long as you remember our rule, the, the only rule that I have that will cost you this relationship will be that you show up where I live. You show up where I live and we're done. That's the surest way to end our relationship. So maybe you don't want to know because if you show up there, you'll--it'll be by accident or something. Uhm, so childhood trauma survivors need more, more of us and, and with me that works out okay because as you can gather from the way I am here, I--when I was in high school, I, I was in an actor. I did, I had the lead in a play and I was a Thespian and I was this and I was that. And I can't act with a damn. Uhm, and I was grateful that I figured that out pretty quickly cuz I'm all me all the time and, ah, so acting is not a possibility. But I'm the way I am. So I thought we weren't going to do that anymore. 

02:55:45
UNKNOWN Question. 

02:55:50
STEVEN FRANKEL Yes? 

02:55:50
UNKNOWN What are the, uhm, ethics problems if you have one goal of the client and say they're on a 28-day-- say for conversation, 28-day, short-term, residential program. 

02:56:05
STEVEN FRANKEL The patient's in a 24-hour a day, 24-day residential program. 

02:56:05
UNKNOWN And when they leave that program, you are say a spiritual counselor in another setting. You don't charge anything and they want to come and be a part of that. Is that still a dual role although your first role has ended? 

02:56:20
STEVEN FRANKEL So the question is if you were involved in treating somebody who's in a residential setting and when they got out of the setting and moved on to the next part of their life, they got involved in a spiritual community where you were involved in some capacity. Could--what's the ethics about having a continued relationship in that second context. I got that question right? 

02:56:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

02:56:40
STEVEN FRANKEL Ah, the, the first, the first question I would raise to answer that is does the residential setting have a rule about its staff and having post-residential therapy relationships with patients because most residential settings that I'm familiar with have a rule that says that their staff cannot get involved in their patients' lives once they've left. And so the first thing I would want to do is I, I would want to check and see what the facility's rules are about that kind of involvement. The second question is, uhm, is it something that if you want to do it, the, the next thing that would be important would be to find out whether you could get consultation from a colleague that, that knows you, know the agency and knows enough about these issues so that you could get a consultation with them cuz consulting with colleagues is really important, not only for the information value but also because of prophylactics against bad things happening. If you can document that you consulted with a colleague and, and, and that, that you've documented that consultation, you have a record of it someplace, it, it protects you enormously, enormously. Uhm, so I--the second step is to get a consultation from a colleague about whether and if so what kind of relationship you could have with that person. And it may be that you're in a setting where it's possible. Uhm, it's not, it's not an absolute thing. So there's no absolute rule about it. It's about--it's a matter of thinking through what will the fact that you were involved with the person this way mean for your later involvement. How will they understand your involvement? What will it mean to them? Uhm, what, what issues get triggered in you that could be risky? Uhm, what could be problematic? What are the downsides of doing that? See if there are policies and agencies, see if there is consultation you can get cuz it--this is like, like a lot of other essic--ethics, ethics issues. There isn't a right or wrong, yes or no thing about this. This is one of those things that, that you explore step by step. But the steps begin with is there a rule or a policy in the agency? Are there colleagues that you can consult with? And I'd start there. Okay. Uhm, so a good rule of thumb, uhm, goes like this. I'm going to do an experiential exercise with you. It'll take about 30 seconds. I am not going to look at you. I don't need you to out yourselves. Uhm, but it, it--there's, there's a point to it. If you want to participate, close your eyes for a second and put your hand over the part of your body where you feel the stress when you get distressed if there is such a place. Uhm, and think to yourself, uhm, if you have a patient that you have felt pretty connected with and that you've seen over a long period of time, for whatever for you is a long period of time, where things changed and they filed a lawsuit against you and they wrote a document saying everything, listing everything that you've disclosed about yourself to them at a time you were in therapy with them. How many pages would it cover? And as you think that, if you feel distressed in any part of your body where you feel distressed, shut up. You're talking too much. Okay, uhm, last but least, not least. We did small communities. Let's do physical contact. I told you that the authors of the book that I value otherwise so much have this rule that says no touching. And I think it's unfortunately because I don't think it's about whether or not it's about under what circumstances, in what way and what the meaning of it and all that kind of stuff. Certainly, there are boundaries to, to touching. We, we don't touch in a sexual way, although the same number of our colleagues do every year. Ah, but, but I don't think about it in quite the way of yes or no or good or bad. If you work with kids, it's really hard to have no touching. The kid comes over and goes and you're touch, you know. It's, it's, it's hard to, to think about it without--so you, so you deal with the parents about how you deal with kids who touch and all that. Uhm, but it's not a matter of whether, it's about what it means. So, so let me give you some examples. Uhm, it--I, I teach other things besides law and ethics. I teach a series of courses in trauma and one of them, I show a video of a, of a session done by a psychiatrist made in 1993 at Michigan State University Medical School. A guy named Fray--Frank Ochberg. He's a senior, senior psychiatrist in the world of PTSD and trauma. And, and the video is of his, ah, treatment of a woman who is a real patient. So we see a real patient with him. And she is in her mid-thirties, late thirties, attractive, engaging, uhm, smart. She's a teacher. She's a professional. She's a teacher. And at some point in her life, she became a single mom of two kids and she had apparently tried to get social service in the community she lived in to help her with her kids. And the guy that they sent out came on to her. And she went for it and he turns out to be a batterer. And she had five episodes of him coming into her place and beating the bejesus out of her. Ah, and then raping her. And, and then fortunately, he left the relationship and, and that was good. But it took her three years before she could go seek therapy because she was so profoundly ashamed by the experience. She'd never had, had anything like that happen to her and she just couldn't tolerate the shame. So she, she took three years before she sought therapy. Since she lived in East Lansing, Michigan, she went to Michigan State and she sought therapy there and she got Frank Ochberg who is a very senior guy, who treats her for seven months before he begins to do the trauma work, which is normal approach in, in, in standard trauma therapy. And he--they work out this very nice relationship and he begins to do an exposure technique because she has flashbacks. And the medications that he gives her which are SSRIs are not succeeding with the meet--treating the flashbacks. And so he does an exposure technique that he developed with her called the counting method where he counts from one to 100 and she imaginal goes through this traumatic stuff that she's carrying and then when they reach 100, it stops. And then they talk about it. And she's going through a scene where, where she--this guy comes in and bat--takes her shirt and shoves it down her mouth, beats her on face, breaks teeth, ah, pounds her and then rapes her. And she goes through tonic immobility where she's perfectly aware of what's going on, can't feel, can't move, nothing and then she dissociates out. And so she's going through this and he's counting and she's, she's profoundly shamed and agonized and all that. And then in the post-intervention discussion, he--it's like she's sitting here looking at the camera. He's sitting here looking at her but there's the camera. There's a cameraman. There's two psychiatric residents here who are watching this training session. And this is the mid-nineties and trauma therapists are getting sued like crazy in the mid-nineties, and so in the post-intervention part of the session, he says--he, he says let me tell you something that's going on with me. You, you were so profoundly in, in, in terrible pain and agony and--with this and there were tissues right next to you. And I wanted to reach over and give you the tissues. And she said oh, I had them. I knew where they were. It's really okay. I had them. And then he says but more than isn't a proper role for me. You have to learn how to take care of yourself. And I thought you're lucky you made this in 1993. I was horrified. Uhm, because she doesn't get a vote in what she needs. Ah, if he would have said well I wanted to put my hand on your shoulder or on your wrist to ground you cuz you were just off, you were off the charts in terms of your, your distress but we hadn't talked about that so I didn't do it. But I wanted to let you know that I was thinking it. She could have then said, well I'm glad you didn't you SOB. I'd have kicked you down the street, or she could have said, that would have been really nice, or she could have said yeah, we didn't talk about that. Uhm, so she doesn't get a vote in what he, what he does. And we--and, and how he handles it. And I don't think that's really good work. But again, 1993, he's probably teaching his residents don't touch, don't make contact. Don't, don't do this. It's dangerous. Uhm, understandable at that timeframe. But, but not now. Uhm, now let's talk about. It's, it's about talking about. So it comes up in my practice because I have trauma survivors and, and part of informed consent includes the issue of there is likely to be a period of time in the work that we do together where you're going to be feeling a lot of really powerful stuff. And either to let you know I'm there or to help ground you, to help, to help you stay within--I, I explain to them what the window of affective tolerance is. Some of you who are trauma therapists know what that word--what that phrase means. The window of affective tolerance. It means they, they're in, they're, they're in the trauma material and as long as they, they are in this window of affective tolerance where they can tolerate the pain or shame or whatever they're feeling, that--the, the exposure technique is helpful. If they are feeling too much distress, they can't benefit from the exposure technique and they get re-traumatized. If they're not feeling enough distress, they're not going to get any benefit from the technique at all. So, so you want to be able to keep them in this window of affective tolerance. And so I'll say, there may be times where I want to let you know I'm here or I think that you're too cranked up or not, not cranked up enough and I may want to just help ground you. And I would do that normally by putting my hand on your wrist or on your shoulder and I would always let you know before I did that just to make sure it was okay. Let's talk about that. So we talk about that in informed consent. Ah, that's a form of touching that, that is a, is a part of trauma therapy. Uhm, I've had patients ask about do you hug patients at the end of sessions? And I say no. I don't because obligate hugs are one of the higher risk forms of patient contact. Obligate hugs always lead to is it as long as it was last time? Is it as tight? Is it this kind of hug? Is it that kind of hug? Is it squeeze? No squeeze? What, how--it leads to comparisons. So obligate hugs may not be a great thing to do. But if they're talked about, touching can be something that's important and can be helpful. But it has to be talked about and it has to be documented. And that's, that's what I think is really important about this. Uhm, I don't think that a no-touching rule per se is helpful. And I don't think a touching-a-lot rule is helpful. I think that talking about it as a part of informed consent and talking about it when it comes up in the, in the, in the therapy is really important, and documenting the discussions, really important. Okay, let's see where we are. Yeah, okay. Uhm, questions about anything that we've covered this morning because we're going to come to a break point and I'm going to stop the formal content of this morning session with this material, uhm, on, on boundary violations. The boundary course is over officially in terms of the content I wanted to share with you. When we come back at 1:15 for those of you who come back, we're going to be dealing with the other areas: competence, moral crimes, ah, a variety of different kinds of things, ah, ah, that'll, that'll come up in the issue of high risk things for clinicians. If you would, come to the microphone. That would be really helpful. Otherwise, I have to repeat your question. 

03:08:30
UNKNOWN At some point, you'll talk about Facebook and also . . . 

03:08:35
STEVEN FRANKEL Oh, yes! Yes. 

03:08:35
UNKNOWN . . . other things that's a hobby. 

03:08:35
STEVEN FRANKEL Yes, yes, thank you. That's really helpful. Let me get these two people and then I'll do the Facebook thing. Go ahead. 

03:08:45
UNKNOWN So, ah, a gentleman this morning asked you about marriage to patients, etcetera. 

03:08:50
STEVEN FRANKEL Uh-huh. 

03:08:50
UNKNOWN I understand that there are ethical rules regarding the length of time between contact and engagement in therapy and contact and engagement and an outside therapy type relationship. I find myself going was it three years or five years or . . . 

03:09:05
STEVEN FRANKEL Depends on the state that you're in. 

03:09:05
UNKNOWN . . . or is it seven, you know. 

03:09:10
STEVEN FRANKEL It, it depends a, a lot on the state that you're in. Some states have actual time rules. Uhm, the, the, the ethics position is you need to think through carefully and with a colleague in consultation what, what it would mean to have anything other than a therapy relationship with a patient once therapy is over. And that includes not just--let's leave sex out--but a friendship. 

03:09:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:09:35
STEVEN FRANKEL And it could, that's, that's another relationship and so you need to have lots of talks with colleagues about is it okay for me to have this relationship once the therapy is over. Is there anything about how long I should wait? Ah, what if they contact me? How--that all should be done in consultation. For sex, different states have different rules. Ah, California has rules that, that say you can't have sex, a sexual relationship within two years of the time that you terminate formally. And, uhm, and then even if you wait for that long, if--you can't terminate in order to start the clock running to have the two years go by. So each state has its own different rules. You want to know what I think? I would think it's--your best policy is no. 

03:10:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:10:15
STEVEN FRANKEL Just no. 

03:10:15
UNKNOWN Okay. Thank you. 

03:10:20
STEVEN FRANKEL It's too loaded. Too loaded. Yes? 

03:10:20
UNKNOWN I have a question. Uhm, do you have any references for examples of documentation as you've just been describing of, ah, using documentation to . . . 

03:10:30
UNKNOWN Documentation for what? 

03:10:30
UNKNOWN To, uhm, for instance, of--about the touch. Like just now . . . 

03:10:35
STEVEN FRANKEL Oh. 

03:10:35
UNKNOWN . . . the--what you described, you described documenting adequately after discussions. I'm asking you have . . . 

03:10:40
STEVEN FRANKEL Not off the top of my head. 

03:10:40
UNKNOWN . . . any references for any sample . . . 

03:10:45
STEVEN FRANKEL But if send me an email, I'll see if I can think of some. I'll try. 

03:10:45
UNKNOWN Thank you very much. Thank you. 

03:10:45
STEVEN FRANKEL Last question, then I got--then I want to talk about Facebook and stuff. 

03:10:50
UNKNOWN It's a question about sex and the informed consent. Right now I'm just an educator. But I say I will not talk to you about issues or I will not at this point, and I won't later as a therapist, if you are doing something that will physically harm you health-wise such as golden showers or something that's going to lead to an STD. And I have other people that you can see or if you even are going to bite someone or spanking and I know other people who deal with those issues. I'll refer you. But it's in the informed consent for them to see. Do I have to be that specific? Is it too much disclosure about me? 

03:11:30
STEVEN FRANKEL I don't think--I would think-- I don't think you need to be that specific. 

03:11:35
UNKNOWN I don't--I just, just a health issue? 

03:11:40
STEVEN FRANKEL Ah, I think that if you start in your informed consent by saying there are certain kinds of issues, hang on before you come up. I'm going to try and stop after this question and deal with the Facebook issue and then if there's more time, I'll have the questions. Uhm, I--it seems to me that you, you are obliged ethically to put the boundaries of your competence and interests and, and what kinds of things you work with and what kinds of things you don't work with in the informed consent period. So you--I don't think you have to so specific that way with the golden shower and all that kind of stuff. That's a little bit too, too specific. But you introduce the subject at a more general level and say do you need any examples of this? And that's when . . . 

03:12:15
UNKNOWN Just the health issues? Can you say that? 

03:12:20
UNKNOWN You can say that, sure. Sure. 

03:12:20
UNKNOWN Steve, are you going to cover supervision this afternoon? 

03:12:20
STEVEN FRANKEL This afternoon I'm going to talk about supervision, yeah. Uhm, I want to talk to you about, about Facebook. I don't want to limit it to Facebook but I wanted to talk about social networking. Uhm, I do not have a Facebook account. I have a very strong web presence because I, I do continuing education programs on the web. So my CV's on my, on my website. Ah, there's some blogs on the website but it's not about me personally. It's about me professionally. Uhm, this is a, an article that was written by a ph--a woman who is a physician in Washington, D.C. And this is what she says about Facebook. I don't know, I don't know if there's a chance you can read it but I'll, I'll just tell you what it says. Uhm, she says: As your doctor, I might sit on the edge of your hospital bed and try to quell your fears and anxieties of being ill. Or, I might bounce into the examination room with a bright smile and try to make you laugh with one of my very funny (read: corny) jokes. We might sit together and catch up on your life over the past six months since we last saw each other. In fact, we might have a patient-physician relationship that makes other patients and physicians utterly jealous. But, please, don't ask me to be your friend. That is, your Facebook friend. Facebook, for those who have been able to resist the popular social networking site's magnetic force field, recently became the most visited Internet site in the U.S., ousting Google from the top position. Facebook "friends" can gain access to each other's profile pages and leave comments, view photos, share links and even send virtual gifts to one another. All of these activities are documented on a person's profile page for anyone with access to view. Now, I can split my physician colleagues into two camps. There's one camp that would be dre--that would not dream of being on Facebook. The mere mention of the F-word sends shivers down their spines. It is too personal, too much potential risk, a frivolous time-suck. Then, there's the other camp of colleagues who are on Facebook and either: a) have awkwardly dealt with a patient who added them as a friend or b) actively dread having a patient add them as a friend. I am on Facebook, and I dread. As social media have redefined (read: near-obliterated) the distinction between personal and professional identities, physicians have been grappling with how to define our professionalism in the digital age. There are currently no national guidelines for social media use by physicians (although the American College of Physicians is reportedly in the process of devising some), and few medical schools have social media policies in place. For many of us physicians on Facebook, the thought of opening up our personal pages filled with family photos, off-the-cuff remarks and potentially, relationship status and political and/or religious views to our patients gives us the heebie-jeebies. For one, there could be sharing of things not usually disclosed in a normal patient-physician encounter. At best, this could result in awkwardness. (For example, you discover I am a huge Wayne Newton fan, and you have previously sworn never to associate with somebody who likes Wayne Newton. Purely hypothetical.) But, at worst, these disclosures could work to dissolve a hard-earned patient-physician bond built on trust and respect. Imagine if a patient tells his doctor he has been sober for months, yet recently uploaded a photo of himself doing a keg stand last weekend. Having a so-called dual relationship with a patient--that is, a financial, social or professional relationship in addition to the therapeutic relationship--can lead to serious ethical issues and potentially impair professional judgment. We need professional boundaries to do our job well. Much more serious are the potential threats to patient privacy that can occur when patients and physicians are communicating on a public platform such as Pac--Facebook. Violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the law that protects against unauthorized disclosure of identifying health information, can result in fines up to $25--$250,000 and/or imprisonment, besides being an ethical breach. The mere existence of a patient-physician relationship (like having others suspect a Facebook friend is a patient) could be a violation of HIPAA. Even behind the pseudo safety walls of "private" profiles, the social circles involved create a potential HIPAA minefield. For these reasons, if you add me as your friend on Facebook, I will have to politely decline. Because I like you. Because I love being your doctor. And, because some lines shouldn't be crossed." Uhm, my biggest problem with Facebook is that you can't trust it's, it's privacy policy. It can shift in a way that you have no control over at any time that they want to shift it. I know that there are some people that are using Facebook as a personal marketing web page. That's, that's fine, as long as you understand that if there's anything private on your Facebook site even if you don't let any of your patients friend you, when/if there is a breakdown in the, in the software when/if there is a change in the company's privacy policy, you got trouble. I am not on Facebook. I waited a long time before I responded to any of these LinkedIn invitations. I get--I must get five to six LinkedIn invitations a week. And I just ignored them for years and years and years. But then there are people who I really know well and I'm close with and begin by telling them I'm not going to do it. Uhm, and then I started to do it with them and now I'm, I'm doing that more. I don't like it, ah, at all. I have a web presence but I don't do the LinkedIn thing and I don't do Facebook at all. I, I think that we need to be careful. Part of what, what is important about us is that we really are private people. And that's part of what our obligation is to keep our privacy. Uhm, I think that this is important. Our patients feel safer with us if they know that we are good in terms of boundaries and privacy. You had a question and then you got your hand up. So come up, come up to the mic and let's do your questions and then I have to leave at noon. Jeff will not feed me if I don't go to his room at noon. 

03:17:55
UNKNOWN Well I have a question. I live in New Orleans. I see a lot of artisans, musicians, ah, and occasionally, they will give me a CD just because it's out and they hand it to me. I accept them because I feel that it, it's good in the relationship. And the other question I have is, uhm, going to see them perform. And I found that I can hardly avoid that if I'm going to go listen to music. But . . . 

03:18:25
STEVEN FRANKEL I think--I don't think . . . 

03:18:30
UNKNOWN Well here's my question. 

03:18:30
STEVEN FRANKEL Yeah, go ahead. 

03:18:30
UNKNOWN They'll very often offer to put me on their guest list, which means if there's a $10 cover charge and I'm on the list, I get in. Now a third question is I've gone to see some of my clients and if it's a big crowd, I don't go up to them and say hi, great performance or anything like that. But if they discover that I've been there, they want to know why didn't you come up and say hello, you know. So that's kind of a question. New Orleans isn't that big of a city. Uhm, I know a lot of, a lot of performers and so it's practically impossible for me to go and not see somebody. 

03:19:10
STEVEN FRANKEL My answer to the questions that you're asking if I understand them right is that it's perfectly okay to do this. What's not okay is to not talk about it. 

03:19:20
UNKNOWN And so I should do that when they come in? 

03:19:20
STEVEN FRANKEL Absolutely. 

03:19:20
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:19:25
STEVEN FRANKEL Absolutely. 

03:19:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:19:25
STEVEN FRANKEL You want to talk about what does it mean that you show up at one of these things, these performances. 

03:19:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

03:19:30
STEVEN FRANKEL What does it mean to them? What do they think it means to you? What does it really mean to you? Those are the three topics. 

03:19:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:19:35
STEVEN FRANKEL What would it mean to you. 

03:19:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:19:35
STEVEN FRANKEL What do you think it means to me and now what, what does it really mean to me. 

03:19:35
UNKNOWN Okay. It really helps me to see them. 

03:19:40
STEVEN FRANKEL And how, and how do you expect that I handle myself. 

03:19:40
UNKNOWN Yes, well one of the things I've discovered is it really helps me to see them on the stage as far as their therapy goes, you know. 

03:19:50
STEVEN FRANKEL Yep. 

03:19:50
UNKNOWN Their performance because a lot of times they're like night and day. 

03:19:55
STEVEN FRANKEL I understand. 

03:19:55
UNKNOWN So anyway, I wanted to ask that because it was sort of gnawing at me. 

03:19:55
STEVEN FRANKEL You talk about it-- about what it means. 

03:20:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:20:00
STEVEN FRANKEL Last question. 

03:20:00
UNKNOWN Just a comment about LinkedIn, LinkedIn. 

03:20:05
STEVEN FRANKEL Yeah. 

03:20:05
UNKNOWN I kept getting invitations and I saw people on there that I respected and liked. And I said yes and they hijacked my entire email list including clients and invited them and invited them repeatedly until I, I wrote a letter to LinkedIn and said that this made me very unhappy. So they said they would quit inviting people. So I--and I'm technologically not advanced so just a warning. And I'd heard good things about it. But I, I'm not very happy with them now. 

03:20:30
STEVEN FRANKEL I understand. Good for you. 

03:20:30
UNKNOWN I don't know how that happened. 

03:20:35
STEVEN FRANKEL Yeah. It, it happened sideways. I know a lot of people who suddenly find themselves on it and really didn't realize that they were doing anything to get themselves on it. Okay, for those of you who are not coming back have a great rest of the day. Have a great conference. Ah, for those of you who are coming back, I'll see you at 1:15.

STEVEN FRANKEL I want, I want to take you to a website to show you some things. 

03:21:30
[sil.] 

03:21:30
STEVEN FRANKEL The website I'm going to take you to is www.apait.org. apait.org. This is a free public website. 

03:22:00
[sil.] 

03:22:05
STEVEN FRANKEL It is the website of the American Psychological Association Insurance Trust. It is public. It is accessible to anyone. It's www.apait.org. 

03:22:15
UNKNOWN I-T or I-P? 

03:22:15
STEVEN FRANKEL I-T. A-P-A-I-T, as in Thomas. American Psychological Association Insurance Trust. Okay. If you put your cursor over Resources, and you slo--scroll down Download Documents and you click on Download Documents, forget about the top set of documents here. There are insurance applications. I'm not here marketing their insurance program. You will see Resources. The first one says Risk Management Article: Beware of Medicare Audits. The second one says Sample Informed Consent Document. Sample Informed Consent Form is what it says. Ah, if you click on that informed consent form, Sample Informed Consent Form, you get a document that you can, you can download that covers a general informed consent agreement that you can use with all your patients. It's an informed consent for treatment. There is also a Sample Forensic Informed Consent Form. There's a Sample Outpatient Services Agreement For Collaterals. Let me tell you what that is and why that's important. 

03:23:50
[sil.] 

03:23:55
STEVEN FRANKEL If you are Ericksonian types, the odds are you see couples and families. And if you see couples and families and you are treating let's say a child is an index case and you're using the family involved in a, in what otherwise might be called adjunctive family therapy or collateral therapy, you have people that are coming to your office that are not the patient as defined by the insurance world. The patient is the identified patient who you specify is the, the patient. But if you have parents coming in, they are collaterals. And this is an informed consent for collaterals. And what it does is it says to whoever it is that comes in, whenever you have a visitors that comes to a psychotherapy session that is not your identified patient, having them sign one of these agreements for collaterals is very good protection for you because it tells them that they do not have patient status in your office, that they are not professionally connected to you as patients. They are--they're as "collaterals" and it tells them what collaterals means and it tells them that there's no--they don't have an access to records. It tells them that basically that they cannot sue you, which is why I'm showing it to you because I'm here to try to help you see some resources that can protect you from lawsuits and board complaints and things like that. 

03:25:20
UNKNOWN Is it in the handout? 

03:25:20
STEVEN FRANKEL If you have people who . . . 

03:25:25
UNKNOWN Is this in our handout? 

03:25:25
STEVEN FRANKEL Is this in your handout? No, it's not. That's why I'm showing you the website and where to find it and how to get it. So this is an informed consent agreement for collaterals. It introduces what a collateral is. It talks about the roles of collaterals in therapy, risks and benefits, records, fees, confidentiality, uhm, do, do collaterals become patients, releases of information, parents as collaterals and so on. And this is an extraordinarily helpful document for you to have in your armamentarium. You can download it for free even if you are not a member of the APA or, or a psychologist at all. It doesn't matter. This is a free public website and these documents are available for you. So I wanted to show you that. 

03:26:10
UNKNOWN Can you repeat that website, please, for us? What's the website? 

03:26:15
STEVEN FRANKEL Just a second. 

03:26:15
UNKNOWN Would you add anything or change anything to that? And would you add any kind of (inaudible ). 

03:26:25
STEVEN FRANKEL You, you have to individualize it to your own practice, your own practice circumstances. So you might make some changes. Okay, the website is www dot a, as in apple, p, as in partridge, a, as in apple, i, as in eye, t, as in trust, dot org, a-p-a-i-t. It stands for the American Psychological Association Insurance Trust, a-p-a-i-t dot org. So it's got all of these informed consent documents that are samples that you, that you can download for free, that you can put on your own letterhead, that you can, uhm, modify for your practice. They have--this is Sample Private Practice Social Media Policy. The, the next one Sample Coaching Contract. The next one is Sample Child Therapy Contract. And then a Primer for HIPPA. Uhm, these are helpful documents for you to be aware of. You can download them for free. They are put up by a malpractice insurance company. That's what the APA Insurance Trust is. It's a malpractice insurance company. And so if you're malpractice--if a malpractice insurance company is making these forms available to you, you can pretty well rely on the fact that they pass muster from a legal point of view because there's nothing in it for the insurance company to give you stuff that is bad. It's just only going to cost them money. So I wanted to bring this website and these documents to your attention so that you would know that they exist. 

03:28:15
[sil.] 

03:28:20
STEVEN FRANKEL And I wanted to take a minute . . . 

03:28:25
[sil.] 

03:28:30
STEVEN FRANKEL I told you that you could download for free from the web this Exploitation Index that is not part of your handout so I'm, I'm just tell you that you can, you can type in Exploitation Index. And what I told you is that was normed on psychiatrists and it's for psychiatry residents but it's--what's important is not so much whether you're a psychiatrist or not, what's important is that this is, ah, an assess--a self, a self-assessment device that asks you to pay attention to yourself. So let me, let me show you how it works. It's--you, you write in whether--what--the, the item that you're, you're dealing with applies to you never which is zero, rarely which is one, sometimes which is two, often which is three. And if you get a total score of 27 or greater, you're in the top 10% of a sample of over 500 and a half psychiatrists. Okay, so it tells you that you're, you're in danger. You're at risk for boundary violations. And this is what, this is what, uhm, it is. It's--you'll see when--if I read you some of the items that it's not sensitive to things in, in this year, 2011 almost 2012. It's also not sensitive to, to--in particular, to nonphysician therapists. So it says things like do you have any--do you any of the following for your family members or social acquaintances: prescribing meds, making diagnoses, offering psychodynamic explanations for their behaviors. Are you gratified by a sense of power when you're able to control a patient's activity through advice, medication or behavioral restraint? Do you find that chronic silence or tardiness of a patient a satisfying way of getting paid for doing nothing? Do you accept gifts or bequests from patients? Have you engaged in a personal relationship with patients after treatment was terminated? Do you touch your patients, excluding handshakes? Do you ever use information learned from patients like business tips or political information for your own financial or career gain? On and on. So, so what you do is you read these things and then you say never, rarely, sometimes, often and if you're score is up in the, in the 27 or greater range, you, you need to, to pay attention to what's going on. So this is the Exploitation Index and I told you I'd show it to you, so I did. 

03:30:50
[sil.] 

03:30:55
STEVEN FRANKEL Okay, so this morning's program was focused on boundaries. Uhm, now I want to start to talk about the other categories of things that get us into trouble. And the first on the agenda is competence. And this is Potter Stewart is a, is a past Supreme Court justice who says ethics is knowing the difference between what you have a right to do and what is right to do. You certainly have a right to ask a patient to sign a waiver so that they can--you can bring your child in to watch what mommy and daddy does for a living but it isn't right to do that. Ah, this is one of my favorite competence stories. This took place in the nineties when trauma therapists were getting their buns sued like crazy. Ah, and this is one of those horror stories. It took place in Manchester, New Hampshire, which is a suburb of Boston these days, ah, over the, the Massachusetts line. Here's what happened. An LCSW who was in practice, who'd been in practice for, for well over 10 years in Manchester, ah, decided in the early nineties that she needed some training in trauma and she'd never had any, which many of us didn't in those days. Most--many of us have been trained more recently have no background in trauma. And since she was in the Boston greater metropolitan area, she found Bessel van der Kolk who is there at Tufts and she went to one of his workshops. And it was a weekend workshop and the scales fell from her eyes and she got how big a deal trauma was. And she got that there were patients that she'd seen in the past that probably were childhood trauma survivors that she didn't recognize as such cuz she had no training and didn't know what to do but now she's all set. She goes back to her office, the following week she sees a new adult female for the first time. She stops halfway through the initial session and says I get it, you're father sexually abused you in childhood. And the patient says my what did who? What? Huh? The patient had no connection to that idea. The, the therapist was absolutely adamant that this was the case. And at the end of the session, the patient went home and the therapist picked up the phone and called the district attorney, gave the name of the patient and her father and said, this man sexually abused his daughter in childhood. You ought to arrest him and the D.A. does. Sends out cops. They arrest him and the father is not only mortified, the father horrified because he believes he's wrongly accused. And, uhm, of course it blew her confidentiality to call the D.A. and give her name out under those circumstances. And then what happens is the father posts bail, bail and gets out of jail and he calls his daughter, who won't talk to him. He calls his daughter's therapist, who won't talk to him. He finally finds a therapist of his own and says will you please see me because I didn't--I'm feeling like I'm coming unglued. And in the process of seeing me, I'd also like it, if you feel comfortable doing this, to see if you could arrange a four-way meeting between you and me and my daughter and me and my daughter and, and her therapist as well so we could sort of sort this out. And the daughter's therapist is not responsive to that request from the father's therapist. So the father files a lawsuit against the therapist for malpractice. Now the father wasn't the patient of the therapist. He, he had no legal standing to sue her for himself because he had no professional relationship with her. She was the daughter's therapist and his daughter was an adult. If the daughter had been a child, she could have--he could have sued her on behalf of his child, but he couldn't sue her for herself. And so the--he could have sued her for defamation. Defamation is saying something bad about a person, uhm, and that's wrong and--but he didn't sue her for defamation, which he could of but he sued her for malpractice, which he probably couldn't have done until this case. And it went up to the New Hampshire Supreme Court to decide whether it was okay for him to sue the therapist of his daughter himself. And the Supreme Court acted on it in this way. There's a saying in the law--in the law school training, you hear a saying that goes: bad facts make bad law. What that means is that when judges get outraged and really annoyed and angry about facts that they hear, they're vulnerable to making bad decisions. And this Supreme Court made a really bad decision. It said that he could sue the daughter's therapist for malpractice. So in the state of New Hampshire, therapists are vulnerable to lawsuits against them from people who aren't their patients. It almost happened in Arizona but the governor before the current one got contacted by people-- some people I know actually, uhm, who convinced the governor to not sign the bill. There was an attempt nationwide to try and change laws during the nineties and early 2000's to make therapists vulnerable to the parents of adult children who were angry at the therapists for whatever the therapist was doing with their adult child. In New Hampshire it is law because of this case. Uhm, so this is a case where the moral of the story for, for us today is if you go to a workshop and learn something new, whatever it is, don't come back and just apply it. Come back and get supervision, get consultation, get experience with it. Don't just implement it yourself without any supervisory support. It's really important. And it's important to do informed consent. Ah, this is a, a slide from one of my favorite websites. The website is called despair.com. Despair.com takes business, ah, uhm, posters and says something cynical about them. Uhm, so this one says "When consulting, if you're not a part of the solution, there's good money to be made in prolonging the problem."

03:36:55
STEVEN FRANKEL So this is the Diderot quote: "There is no moral precept that doesn't have something inconvenient about it." And this is where I was going to tell you about my study group. Once a month I get in the car, I drive from where I live near Walnut Creek to Oakland and then from Oakland to Davis and then back to Walnut Creek where my office is. And that is not convenient at all to do that. But I've been doing it once a month since 19--January of 1999. And it, it is really a helpful thing to do to have a consultation group, really, really helpful. I told you this morning that one of the highest risk areas for mental health professionals is in those who work with families where there is a custody fight going on. This is an extraordinarily high risk area and so I wanted to talk about the, the risks involved and see if I can give you some insulation, some ways to protect yourselves in the event that you are doing work with families where there is a custody fight going on. Uhm, I want to talk a little bit about custody evaluators. I want to talk about special masters and parent coordinators and then I want to talk about treating clinicians. How many of you have--are, are doing custody evaluations? Any of you custody evaluators? A couple of you, okay. And how many, how many of you have ever been or intend to be special masters or parent coordinators? Don't. Uhm, the shortest lived job there is. It is--and you'll see why when we get there. Ah, how many of you see families where--or anybody--where there is a custody fight going on? Okay, so the bulk of it will be about that. So let me talk a little bit about custody evaluators. Not only in California but nationwide, custody evaluators are exempt from lawsuits. They are protected by quasi-judicial immunity so that if you are a custody evaluator, the--neither of the parties can sue you in civil court for malpractice because you, you are a judicial officer if you are a court-connected evaluator. So you're immune from civil suits. What you're not immune from is board complaints and not only in California but in many other states, if not most in the other states. The highest frequency category for board complaints is custody evaluators because it's usually the top 5% of the conflicted cases that require custody evaluators and of those, you got people who can't negotiate with each other. You can't--people who can't have their lawyers negotiate with each other, and they're really hard to deal with. And one of them is going to be mad at you, really mad. And these are people who are so far out there that they'd rather take you down if their mad at you than leave you alone. And so custody evaluators are protected from lawsuits but not from board complaints. And the good news about board complaints-- well let me, let me get there. Uhm, know--you should know the rules. There's no ex parte contact. You can't have contact with either side without the other side being involved. Your work has to be transparent. Your documentation has to be up to stuff. You need training and consultation, uhm, ongoingly. Out in California, our custody evaluators typically have custody evaluator peer consultation groups where they talk about their cases because they need the extra support to stay safe. The good news is that very few of these board complaints result in discipline against the evaluator because the boards know that the parties that make these complaints are nuts. They're just, they're really out there. I mean, let me, let me give you an example. I, I represented a, a custody evaluator who was working with a family where mom was living here, dad was living there, and the children were in a separate residence. And there was a restraining order to keep dad away from his children. And the custody evaluator made a mistake. She wrote a letter to go to all the parties and to the children and she put in the salutation the names and addresses of mom, of dad and the children. So that everybody could see where everybody was. Dad reported her to her licensing board. Said he was outraged that she told him where his children were because he had a restraining order to stay away from his children. And so her letter to the board said, I'm really sorry. I wouldn't do this again. It was--it wasn't a good idea for me to do that. Uhm, and, and I get it. My cover letter said since when is it wrong to tell somebody where they cannot go without violating the law and getting busted and sent to prison? What's wrong about that? They closed the case. But that's how, that's how far out they are. I mean, they are really, really out there. So there are lots and lots of complaints that are filed against custody evaluators but the boards know, the staff knows, that the people who file them are not on solid ground. And so very few of them go anywhere. Hardly any of the cases result in discipline. Uhm, you are more protected if you practice custody evaluation in a state where there is a lot of mandatory contin--continuing education requirements for you because what we did in California was the, the judicial arm of the government passed a statute that says you got to have lots and lots and lots of continuing ed every year. And what that did was it cut off the tails of the distribution of custody evaluators so that the custody evaluators who are really out there, cuz years ago, custody evaluators were, were making it up. They, they were just sort of opining about the way it should be without really doing anything thorough. There, there were a lot of problems that way and it caused a lot of litigation. So with the amount of training that's been prescribed in the law, the tails of the distribution of custody evaluators has been cut off and they are more alike. So everybody does the same kind of evaluation, uses very common assessment devices, common assessment approaches, uhm, writes reports that make sense and are like each other's reports. And there's very little problem with the board complaints against the custody evaluators in reality. It's just that it's part of the territory of being a custody evaluator that you get board complaints. Special masters. The top 5% of the top 5% of the conflicted couples in divorce--in, in custody are so unmanageable that the judicial system, the judges, decided that they needed a buffer between them and these crazy people. This was entirely done by the judges. And they did it for that reason. They did it because they didn't want to interact on an ongoing basis with parent who are nuts and who, who can't get un-nuts. And so what they did was they created a new job title called special master. Special masters appear in a variety of different parts of the law. Let me give you an example that's not related to family law. Uhm, we had a psychologist who was shot to death in the streets in Concord, California about 10 years ago, murdered. And what happened was that the, the police wanted his clinical records so that they could find out whether any records that he was keeping suggested that one of his patients might have been the killer. And his malpractice insurance company had to hire a lawyer to go fight that because I don't know about you and your pro--your informed consent documents but my informed consent documents that I have my patients sign does not say in case somebody murders me, you agree that your records should be accessible to the police. That's not a part of my informed consent and I suspect that it probably isn't your either. So the malpractice insurance company hired a, an attorney to protect the psychologist's records. What the judge did was he said find me a senior psychologist. I will appoint that person to be a special master. That person will go through the files and tell us if there's anything to worry about with any of the patients. And that's what he--that's what happened. Turns out, the guy didn't keep records. That's another story. We, we are infamous in the, in the world of lawyers for professions who are the worst recordkeepers in the world. Many of us don't keep records at all. Not safe. Not safe. Uhm, okay, so, so in family law, a special master is somebody who buffers between a judge and these crazy people and they are judicial officers. They are called referees is the technical leg--legal term for them. And they, they function like judges. And depending on their orders, they can have orders that say, you're a judge. You will make findings. You will issue that you, that you--these people have to follow. And if they don't, you can order sanctions. You can fine them just the way a real judge would do it. And who can be a special master? Any licensed mental health professional and and any attorney that, that wants to do this work can do this work. And some of the special masters orders don't say that you can make findings and make orders and, ah, ah, sanction people, it just wants--they, they want you to do something clinical with these people to see if you can get them to work with each other. But the ones that allow you to do these things that only judges do are highly, highly dangerous because you're dealing with the craziest people around who would rather take down their spouse--their ex-spouse or their ex-partner and you in the process if they can't have the custody they want. And so what the judiciary did not do is they did not when they created this category of special master referee, they didn't define the category as one that was exempt from licensing board actions. So they didn't, they didn't protect the special masters, the psychologists, the psychiatrists, the social workers, MFTs, counselors and attorneys are unprotected because the judiciary did not institute that protection. And so what happens is that the crazy, anger party that doesn't get the way they want reports you to your licensing board, which now is evaluating your functioning, doing things none of us were trained to do. None of us were trained to tell people you will do-- you'll--dad, you'll you pick up this at this time and this day and you will deliver the child to mom and mom, you will take the child and if any of you blow, I'll fine you. We were never trained to do that. I don't know, were you trained to do that? I wasn't trained to do that. So we are now vulnerable to licensing board actions against us for unprofessional conduct as mental health professionals. It's a bad deal. So I was on a panel with the Association of Family Conciliation Courts in the, in the California division where Schneider--where Paul Schneider is the presiding judge in Los Angeles. And he agrees that everything I just told you is true. And he said, uhm, the judiciary has uttering failed to protect special masters and parent coordinators from licensing board actions. And this is a big problem, which is why I said don't when you raised your hand and said you do this sometimes. If you have orders that don't allow you to write orders and make findings and apply sanctions, you're safer. But if your order gives you the right to do that, then if you do any of those things, you're at really high risk. Ah, yeah? 

03:48:10
UNKNOWN Can't that be easily rectified by implementing a training requirement for these people if they want to get this special, uhm, label in law? 

03:48:20
STEVEN FRANKEL Well they often do have special training. The, the, the problem is that they're not functioning--when they do this work-- they're not functioning as mental health professionals. They're functioning as referees, as judic--as figures from the judiciary. They're making decisions. And they're making these decisions from, from their clinical knowledge, using their clinical knowledge to do that, but they do things that none of us do in clinical work with patients. And what's needed is an addendum to the statute that created this job that says and when you are functioning as a special master, you are exempt from licensure act--actions against you. It could--it's easily done if they would be willing to do it. They've just never been willing to do it. So parent coordination or special mastering is a very high-risk enterprise. It's very stressful, uhm, because you're dealing with the highest conflict couples there are and there's a lot of danger. And typically, it's the shortest-lived profession there is. Most people who do this, don't do it very long because the amount of heat that you take is typically enormous. Okay, uhm, treating clinicians. I could tell--I could take rest of the time we have available for this afternoon and talk about this one because it varies state by state by state. So let me tell you that I have written a chapter in a, in a book that uses California law but the issues that I talk about in the chapter are generic for all states. The answers I give are California law answers but the issues, what, what's the issue of who, who holds the privilege for a minor. Uhm, that issue varies from state to state to state. The fact that it's an issue is, is general. Uhm, so if you want the chapter, I'll send it to you free. Send me an email. If you download the, uhm, the set of files from the, ah, Erickson website the way that Jeff told you this morning, the first slide that you see will have my email address and you'll get caught in my spam blocker and it'll say you have to say please, please, please and this and that, but I, I check it daily so I'll let you in. Uhm, so it's really important that you know your statutes about psychotherapist's privilege, who holds the privilege for a minor, under what circumstances does the minor hold his or her own privilege. In many states, minors over a certain age hold their own privilege. Uhm, there are issues that vary state to state in terms of who has custody and who has legal and who has physical and what's joint and what's not, and that varies state to state. One thing that you may know about because people across the country are doing it, is they are putting into their informed consent when they're dealing with, with, with couples and families something that, that clinicians are calling the lit--litigation limitation. Litigation limitation is a paragraph that goes into your informed consent that says, you want me to treat--in essence, you want me to treat your kids? I'm happy to do it if you'll sign this document that says that if you get legal with each other, you don't subpoena me and my records. You leave, you--we protect the child's therapy. And that's fine. You can use it. You can, you can put it in your, in your, ah, informed consent but don't expect that it will protect because I've seen judges say I don't care what it says. I, I, I want, I want you to be able to subpoena the therapist and bring the subpara--the, the therapist in for, for a deposition. I want the records. It's okay. So some will say no, I can't because you signed a contract and a contract is a contract. Others will say, the hell with it, bring her in or bring him in. So you can use it but don't rely on it. And now the third piece on this page is, is a piece where I see the greatest number of problems, uhm, for clinicians. I'll get a call from a clinician who's treating a child who says mom and dad both signed agreements to authorize me treat this child. Now dad's angry and doesn't want me to continue to treat the child and says I have to let go of the child and refer the child elsewhere. Uhm, and what'd I do? And generally--and, and, and if you know your law, you know how to think about this. In California, the law says that if you get two signatures that authorize treatment, if one changes their mind and pulls out, there's no law that says that you have to stop. You're not bound by law to discontinue treatment. The issue is what's the best thing to do for the child. The clinicians who get in trouble say I have a very good relationship with this child. The therapy is going exceedingly well. Dad is out of his mind. He's the bad guy. I don't want him to bully me around and to bully the child around. I'm hanging in. And dad just escalates. Dad just escalates. And winds up making both the child and the thera--and the therapist and the mom upset, angry, distressed until finally mom says, okay, let's get the child into new therapy. And the therapist goes down in flames. And it's not a great idea for a kid, not a therapeutic moment for kids to see their therapist go down in flames at the hands of their outraged parent. So the general wisdom here is if you are seeing somebody and both parents have agreed for you to see them and one pulls out and says no, I want you to stop, your well-advised for the child's benefit because of what the escalations will look like, to start to make the referral. That's the safest thing to do for the child, which is really what the concern is here. Uhm, saying that the, that the parent who's-- who wants you out is bully and is out of their mind and whatever, that's nice but, but the child needs some protection. Okay, so that's what I wanted to say about the family law piece. Uhm, then we got confidentiality breaches. And there are lots, there are lots of confidentiality breaches. It's, it's really an amazing thing. I keep hearing about these. And again, many of them aren't actionable in, in, in civil suits but they are actionable in terms of, ah, board complaints. So let me, let me see if I can frame this discussion about, about confidentiality. The general concept--construct that applies is privacy. Privacy is something that many state's constitutions have the word privacy in there. We Californians have the word privacy in our state constitution. It says we have a right to privacy. Of course, in the, in the digital age, we have no privacy. But we have a right to it. Uhm, the U.S. Constitution does not have the word privacy, which is why Roe v. Wade has been such a controversial decision. Uhm, I mean, it's controversial for the obvious reasons, but the legal controversy has been since the word privacy doesn't exist in the U.S. Constitution, the fact that the Roe v. Wade drafters, the, the, the justices who wrote Roe v. Wade, crafted it--their ans--their response so that they wove together a series of rights that do exist in the Constitution that they say these mean privacy, a number of rights that, that offer women privacy to discuss their reproduction issues with a physician in consultation and make a decision about, about abortion. But the word doesn't exist in the U.S. Constitution. It does in state constitutions. But the concept is privacy. Confidentiality is privacy in the context of psychotherapy. So confidentiality is the expectation that patients have that the fact that they're in therapy in and of itself and anything about what they disclose in therapy, uhm, are protect unless they authorize the disclosure. If the disclosure is into the legal system, it is no longer called confidentiality, it's called privilege, psychotherapist-patient privilege. So privilege is about the disclosure of confidential information into the legal system. Here is what you've got to look out for. How many of you have received subpoenas for records? Yeah. Happens a bunch. Uhm, and this is a state by state issue. So if I say something that's not true in your state, don't take umbrage. Uhm, there are certain principles about these subpoenas that I want to articulate that are pretty much in common state by state, with the exception of Washington state which uses the word subpoena for even a court order--what the rest of us call a court order, which is an order by a judge, written by a judge, signed by a judge, but it still is called a subpoena in Washington state. Subpoenas are sent by lawyers. Subpoenas are data gathered devices that lawyers use to get information about their cases so that they can see what the information says and make decisions about how to, how to run, run a case. So a subpoena comes from an attorney and it requests records. Whether the subpoena is proper depends on the state that you live in and practice in. Some states require that you cannot respond to a subpoena by sending records unless you get a signed release from the patient who's records these are or from the parent who is the legal, ah, guardian or the custodian of the child. Some states have, have laws that say that children of a certain age have to be the ones that sign the releases themselves. Some states it's 12 years of age, some it's 13, some it's 11, some no children have the right to sign their own releases. But if you get a subpoena and it doesn't contain a release and you can't identify it as the signature of the patient, it's really important that you contact the patient right away, as soon as possible. It's, it's a good idea to contact the lawyer too. But it's important that you contact the patient. Do you know that your records are being subpoenaed? Do you agree that the record should be sent in to whatever this matter is? Will you come and sign a release if there isn't one already? 

03:58:20
UNKNOWN What if the CPS is the guardian and subpoenaing? 

03:58:25
STEVEN FRANKEL What if CPS is the guardian ad litem? 

03:58:30
UNKNOWN Guardian and subpoenaing. 

03:58:30
STEVEN FRANKEL I missed the last word? What if CPS is the guardian and . . . 

03:58:35
UNKNOWN The people who are subpoenaing the records. 

03:58:35
STEVEN FRANKEL And CPS is subpoenaing the records. Uhm, if, if in your state-- I don't know what state you live in--but . . . Arizona. If in your state, CPS has the legal right to subpoena records when it is the guardian, it would make legal sense, if they are really the guardians, if CPS--in California, CPS is not--is never a guardian. A guardian ad litem is chosen and appointment by a judge. But in--if in your state, CPS can be a legal guardian, then they have the right to the records because whoever is the child--a child's guardian, if there is a guardian appointed, has the right to the records. So that, that could happen. What's imp--what's--yeah? 

03:59:20
UNKNOWN If you're, ah, consultant to somebody that's in the group but the--I and the consultant also have to have them sign releases for anything that I know and that I rec--that I contribute? 

03:59:35
STEVEN FRANKEL If you're a consultant . . . 

03:59:35
UNKNOWN To other therapists. 

03:59:35
STEVEN FRANKEL . . . to other therapists and they get a subpoe--and you get a subpoena for your, your . . . 

03:59:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

03:59:40
STEVEN FRANKEL . . . consultation records? 

03:59:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

03:59:45
STEVEN FRANKEL You need to make sure that the patients that are being consulted about authorize you--a release for you. 

03:59:50
UNKNOWN Okay, so I can back to the original therapist and receive that? 

03:59:55
STEVEN FRANKEL Yes. Okay, uhm, one of the things that has happened, ah, to a great extent in California that makes me really angry is that licensing boards will send letters about a complaint that a patient has made to the licensing board, they'll send a letter to the clinician. And the licensing board is supposed to include with the letter a release signed by the patient so that you are free to answer the board's questions and address them. As you might imagine because I've already told you that a lot of the complaints--the major category of complaints to our licensing board as, as they are in many states, is about custody evaluation and about custody stuff. And what happens is that let's say dad makes a complaint about a treating clinician to the board, signs a release for himself and his child. The board sends a letter to the clinician and says dad's filed a complaint against you. He's released you to talk about him and the child, answer these questions. You can't because you don't have a release from mom. And that the board would set the clinician up because if a clinician's not getting a hold of a lawyer when they get this thing from the, from the board, it's really important that they do but if they don't, they're, they're in danger and the board is setting them up for violating mom's confidentiality. Yeah? 

04:01:25
UNKNOWN It's a catch 22 because as part of your license, you have to cooperate with any board action or questions about you. 

04:01:35
STEVEN FRANKEL Yes, you do have to cooperate and that is . . . 

04:01:35
UNKNOWN I would like to comment also about the custody evaluations. On our board, we have seen an increase. But what happens, therapists set themselves up. They'll say that one parent will make a better parent than the other one when they've never interviewed the other parent. 

04:01:55
STEVEN FRANKEL Not a good idea. 

04:01:55
UNKNOWN And that's protecting them--and that's the one parent they haven't met that is filing the complaint. 

04:02:00
STEVEN FRANKEL Yeah, it's, it's a flat breach of ethics to make any evaluative statements about anybody that you haven't evaluated unless you've, unless you've had an opportunity to do, to do some kind of a, of an assessment, ah, even a third party assessment. If you've seen the records that somebody developed but you have to qualify what you say, ah, under those circumstances. Yeah, th--not a good idea to make comments about anybody that you haven't seen yourself. Yeah? 

04:02:25
UNKNOWN If the client is working with an attorney, and there's an agreement between them that the attorney will subpoena their records, is there a responsibility on the attorney's part to educate his client about the effect of what he or she means in terms of it no longer being private information? 

04:02:50
STEVEN FRANKEL It is, it is a part of the attorney's obligation to explain that by subpoenaing records, uhm, and by entering the records into the legal system that they'll--that unless a judge is willing to sign a protective order, ah, sealing them. 

04:03:00
UNKNOWN And if they don't do that? 

04:03:05
STEVEN FRANKEL And if . . . 

04:03:05
UNKNOWN I'm in a situation where . . . 

04:03:05
STEVEN FRANKEL If the attorney doesn't do that? 

04:03:05
UNKNOWN The attorney does not educate the client. 

04:03:10
STEVEN FRANKEL Well I, I think that the other piece of it--so let me, let me just sort of finish what I started. In addition to the fact that it is part of the attorney's job to do that, to educate the patient about what it means to have their records come into the legal system, it's also important for clinicians when they get a subpoena for records to contact the patient right away, sit down with the patient and say I want to show you what's in your records. Ah, you, you can bill for the time. Ah, ah, there's a--I've added a paragraph to my, to my implom--informed consent document that says if you get involved in legal things where you--where I get dragged in, I'm going to charge this much money kind of thing. That's entirely legitimate. So you sit down with the patient. You say you want to go through the records? I want you to see what the records say. I want you to see what's going to be exposed in the legal system if your records go in. You have also an ob--obligation to prepare the patient for wha--for what happens when records get subpoenaed. So it's both. Uhm, so subpoenas-- and by the way, just, just for the, the humor of it. Subpoena comes from Latin. It means under penalty. And the reason that it means under penalty, besides the fact that that's what the words mean, ah, is that if you get a subpoena, you can't forget about it. You can't throw it away. You can't ignore it. You have to respond to it in some way. You don't always have to do what it says. If you get a court order, you have to do what it says. If it's signed a judge, you, you have to do what it says or you're committing, ah, ah, ah, an act of contempt and you could be fined and put in jail. So if a judge says do this, you do it. Uhm, if a lawyer says do this, you don't necessarily have to do it that way but you can't ignore it cuz what will happen will be that the lawyer will go to the court and get an order for your arrest with $25,000 bond. You can't ignore a subpoena. You have to do something. Yeah? 

04:05:05
UNKNOWN I work for a federal agency where, ah, the clients that we work with are criminal offenders. 

04:05:10
STEVEN FRANKEL Guy works for a federal agency where, ah, the clients are criminal offenders. 

04:05:15
UNKNOWN And a lot of the, ah, clinicians for the case are law enforcement agents also. 

04:05:20
STEVEN FRANKEL And the clinicians that do treatment are law enforcement agents also. 

04:05:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. So there are a lot of them where the line of your role seems very blurred. So what's best advice you have on should you go with the clinical side or you go with the legal side. 

04:05:40
STEVEN FRANKEL Uhm, if I'm dealing with law enforcement, I'm dealing with them as law enforcement personnel. I don't care how clinically cool they are. Uhm, I'm, I'm dealing with them as--I would view them as law enforcement personnel and, and not get too hopeful about the clinical piece. Clinical just-- if they're clinically trained, it means they know how to talk to people which may mak--give their, their law enforcement piece some extra skill but they're still law enforcement agents. 

04:06:10
UNKNOWN For example, say you have a case where, you know, in criminal justice you share--it's, it's nothing for them to share information with a lawyer without being subpoenaed for, for those records. But as a clinician, you know that I need a court order, you know, to share the records. 

04:06:25
STEVEN FRANKEL If, if there's--if, if there are issues about confidentiality and protecting doc--documents, protecting communications, the, the person who is the--both law enforcement agent and clinician has to declare which one they are and be bound by the rules that apply to that one. I'm both an attorney and a psychologist. I can't be somebody's both. I can't, I can't be an attorney for my patients or and, and--it doesn't go both ways. I have to, even though I have information and skills that apply--can apply in both situations, if there is--if I'm, if I'm a, a clinician treating a patient and a legal issue comes up, I refer it to an attorney. So you, you have to pick one. You can't, you can't say I'm one of these but I can also violate rules that, that this one has to abide by. 

04:07:10
UNKNOWN But if it does, and if they're . . . 

04:07:15
STEVEN FRANKEL Okay. Uhm . . . 

04:07:15
UNKNOWN They are hired to be both. 

04:07:15
STEVEN FRANKEL Got you. So, so here's, here's the way that gets dealt with. Our ethics codes say-- there's a, there's a part--all of our professional societies have an ethics code that reads something like when there is conflict between a, a professional and organizational tasks, or organization structure or the conflict between the individual and an organization, and what the ethics codes say is when you are told to do something by your boss and you believe it's wrong, you hav--you are obliged to res--raise the issue and document that you have raised the issue and try to work it out in a way that's consistent with the ethics code. And if you cannot, you are free to go ahead and do what you are not ethically, properly--what is not ethically proper to do if you're, you, you don't--the ethics code won't make you force yourself to quit your job or get fired. That's what the ethics principally is. We want you to make a, make an issue of this. Try to work it out. If you can't we're not going to make you quit your job and we're not going to make you get fired. But we do want you to raise the issue. And so professionals, mental health people that are employed by an agency, when the agency says do this and it's contrary to their ethics code, the only real obligation they have ethically is to raise the issue and say this is a real problem for me ethically. Can we work this out so that I can be within my, my ethics code. And if the answer is no, we can't work it out, then the clinician just does what they have to do to keep their job. But they keep a record of having raised the issue cuz that's the ethics issue. And we see that actually a lot where an organization will tell employee clinicians to do this or to do that that's not consistent with ethics. And the clinician has to raise it and see if they can work it out. And if they can't, they, they can what they're, they're told to do without being unethical. Okay, uhm, if it's a group or family therapy--yeah? 

04:09:10
UNKNOWN Will you comment on the obligations for therapists in private practice when they're seeing somebody who is active status in the military? I'm asking if they're bound by the (inaudible ) 

04:09:30
STEVEN FRANKEL Uhm, I'm not sure what kind of thing you're interested in having me comment about, private practice and therapist seeing people who are ac--active duty military. 

04:09:35
UNKNOWN Their commanding officer can be able to obtain my private records, my records of seeing somebody that I was seeing in private practice. 

04:09:45
STEVEN FRANKEL Okay. 

04:09:45
UNKNOWN I might be seeing them in couple therapy. His wife might be a civilian but the husband might be active status in the military. 

04:09:55
STEVEN FRANKEL What, what it's called is informed consent. If you have a situation where there, there are rules that you have to abide by that are not your typical kinds of rules and where there are risks for the patient, you have to disclose of that in an informed consent and document it. They have to know what they're getting into. 

04:10:10
UNKNOWN Does the commanding officer have the right to them? 

04:10:15
STEVEN FRANKEL I don't know the answer to that. I don't--I've not study that part of military law. So I don't, I don't know the answer to that specific question. But, uhm, but I will say that if you find out that the answer is yes, they have a right to it, the patient needs to know. Everybody in, in the system that you're treating needs to know. But I don't know the answer to that question. Yeah? 

04:10:30
UNKNOWN We, ah, work with a lot of, ah, military people at our agency in North Carolina, and, ah, from what I understand about the (inaudible ) and the whole pecking order of the military and all that kind of stuff, the records are private. He is not privy to the commanding officer (inaudible ). 

04:10:51
STEVEN FRANKEL Okay, for our listening audience, we have somebody who works with the military a lot and says that the commanding officer is not privy to the records just because they want them. Yeah, is it about this issue? 

04:11:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

04:11:00
STEVEN FRANKEL Okay. 

04:11:00
UNKNOWN Ah, this military family and, ah, they usually come through a care benefit insurance called TriWest. 

04:11:10
STEVEN FRANKEL TriWest, yes. 

04:11:10
UNKNOWN And so through TriWest, ah, it's very easy . . . 

04:11:15
STEVEN FRANKEL I'm going to go there. 

04:11:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

04:11:15
STEVEN FRANKEL Give me a minute because I'm going to go to third party payers. Yeah? 

04:11:20
UNKNOWN I have question about a religious court (inaudible ) civil courts where you go . . . because I was once a witness and boy I got stuck. I'd never do it again. 

04:11:30
STEVEN FRANKEL In civil or in religious court? 

04:11:30
UNKNOWN I got stuck in the civil court and they were going to rule no matter what was said to the man or woman. 

04:11:40
STEVEN FRANKEL Yeah. I've, I've not heard this issue come up so I don't know how, how to, how to address it. Sorry. 

04:11:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

04:11:45
STEVEN FRANKEL All right. Uhm, let me go on. We're going to be here way long. I've got a lot to cover. For group therapy or family therapy, everybody has to sign releases unless you've had the family members sign one of those collateral forms, then they don't have to. Ah, you have to know what the laws are in your state about a minor's privilege. I did the board inquiry already. Uhm, then there are confidentiality breaches when clinicians get caught off guard. I've actually seen cases where complaints have been made because two clinicians who work for an agency go to a bar or coffee shop after work and sit and talk about work. And the person at the next table or the next bar stool overhears the conversation, recognizes who they are talking about, tells the person they're talking about that they talked them and there's been trouble. So when clinicians are caught off-guard, it's really a difficult thing. You, you need to be careful about where you, you go and what you say. Uhm, if you don't have good soundproofing in the office, you have to be careful. Uhm, if you leave files left out, those are confidentiality breaches. Again, we're not seeing many confidentiality breaches for lawsuits but we see them for board complaints. Ah, third party payer problems. So this is your-- we're, we're going to talk about, ah, let me see if I talk about that here. That's there. So I'm going to talk about some other ones. Uhm, third party payer problems include fraud, upcoding. Uhm, I had a case, incredible, I got contacted by a psychiatrist from San Francisco who has been a provider for a managed care company for 10 years at the time he contacted me. He contacted me in October of 2009. He'd gotten a letter from--there was some sort of complaint about him filed with the third party payer and he had to send in a whole bunch of charts and it turns out that he only charted every fourth session. And he billed for every session but only charted every fourth session and in his chartings, he didn't always allude to what happened in the intervening three sessions. And he got a letter from the third party payer that said this is called fraud. Uhm, you're billing for sessions that haven't been documented and so they didn't happen. And this is called insurance fraud. Send us $150,000 now. So he calls me and I said, uhm, do you have a copy of the contract you signed with the company when you became a provider 10 years ago and do you have a copy of the preferred provider manual that the company had for you when you signed on with the company 10 years ago? Yes. That was good. It was good that he, he had those. Obsessive-compulsive enough for, for, for me to do my work. And I read the contract and I read the provider manual and what it says is--it was so interesting--what it said was that the company will do four times every calendar year, four times every calendar year, it will sample 25% of its high volume providers. This guy was a high volume provider. High volume provider means he gets more than 25 referrals every two years. So four times a year, they'll sample 25% of their high volume providers and for an educational audit and based on the educational audit, they will either take corrective measures and, and teach the person who to chart better or they'll say you're doing fine. The guy had been a provider for 10 years, four audits a year had never had drawn--they never drew his name for one of these educational audits. I computed the probability of that. I did take statistics in graduate school. And I computed the probability of that and I actually called my--I'm, I'm, I'm a clinical professor at U.S.C. still and I have very close relationships with the faculty. Uhm, and, and I called down to a contact of mine at the faculty at U.S.C and I said Mick, talk to whoever does the statistics, make sure I do this right. And I did it right. I computed the probability that, that he would not be called four times a year, 10 years. The probability is less likely than flipping 25 heads in a row of a fair coin. That's how unlikely it would be that he would be not sampled in 10 years. So I said to the company, ah, because they're using fraud. Fraud is a big word. If you use fraud in a, in a, in a healthcare case, it means that your licensing board is going to act against your license. Once the insurance company is done with you and they do whatever they're going to do, the report goes to your licensing board because the licensing boards want to hear and it, in almost all states, there's a, there's a statute that says if, if, if a, if an agency or a, or a hospital or a company or a, an insurance company act against someone for clinical misbehavior of any sort, it has to be reported to the licensing board. So I know that this guy's going to lose his license if, if, if he can't get out of this because not only would he have to pay them the $150K he owes them, he also is going to have to, uhm, deal with the medical board, which is not going to be happy. And so I say you guys sound like you, you had a contract that required you to sample 25% of your high volume providers. He's never been sampled. That's called a material breach of contract. I got a letter back that said, no, uhm, he--each time we sample, we sample 25%. That means has a 75% chance of not being sampled. I said yeah, but that's if you only sampled once. You sample four times a year. I'm right. I took statistics. We never heard from them again. 

04:17:40
UNKNOWN Oh, my god. 

04:17:40
STEVEN FRANKEL It went away. I went whew! To say nothing of what he did. Ah, uhm, so third party payers are doing these post-payment audits and, uhm, I'm going to talk about those in a minute. Fraud misrepresentation, I've talked about already. This is one I want to talk to you about in a really clear way. There are plenty of times when people that we're treating get mad at us and threaten to sue us and report us to our licensing board. We are free to negotiate with them to prevent a lawsuit. We are free to say how much money do you want me to repay you. You, you can do that all you want. What you cannot do is to negotiate with them to not report you to your licensing board. It is unethical. It's a breach of ethics. And if your, if your licensing board learns that you have negotiated with a patient to keep them from making a licensing board complaint about you, it will act against your license. And here's the reason. Licensing boards are created to protect the public. That's their primary mission. They are not created to be friends with the professionals. The, the professionals are the regulated community. The public is the object of the regulation to be protected. If the licensing board learns that a member of the regulated community who may have and who is suspected of doing something wrong, thwarted the board's right to evaluate and investigate this situation by negotiating with the patient to not make a complaint, the board will act. So it's very important that your response to a board threat be like this: If you want to make a report to the board, go ahead and do it. I'll deal with it when it comes but why don't we talk about what you're mad at me for. Let's talk about what you're upset with me for. But if you want to make a report to the board, go ahead and make it. I'll deal with it when it comes. Because the odds are that most complaints to boards are going to go nowhere. And you want to be able to document that you said those words. You want to make a report to my board, go right ahead. I'll deal with it when it comes but why don't we for now talk about what you're so upset about. That's the way you handle it. You document that. Post payment audits. Briefly put, the money that you get paid by a third party payer isn't yours for five years. I can't say it anymore bold--bluntly than that. So if you have Value Options or, ah, Magellan or Aetna or Blue Cross Blue--whoever, whatever third, ah, CHAMPUS, ah, is another one, you raised that with TriWest. You--the money that you get isn't yours until five years have passed when they can no longer come after you with a--with an audit. And what they are doing now is they're coming after providers with audits. They say send me these charts. If it's, if it's an educational audit, you don't have to worry about it because if something's wrong, they'll fix it with you and you'll, you'll be okay. But if it's based on a complaint, uhm, or a random audit that isn't educational in nature, pay attention because they're going to want your charts and sometimes they let you pick five charts. Sometimes they tell you they want 50 charts. They want--and they'll name the people. Uhm, and they want to know what your chart look like. Here's what they're going to do. They're going to have nurses look at your charts and compare the way that you chart with the charting guidelines that the company publishes in its preferred provider agreement. Our problem is that most of us chart one way for anybody that we see. We don't chart one way for Value Option patients and another way for, for CHAMPUS patients and another way for . . . We chart the way we chart. And if you're not charting the way that the insurance company has put in the agreement that you're going to chart that way, they can start to act against you. And they get incredibly picky. Uhm, I saw a TriWest one where--which is CHAMPUS--where they, uhm, they wanted--they, they dinged a therapist who billed 90847 for family therapy but didn't write the name of the family member who was in the room, wrote the word mother but didn't write her name. Wouldn't pay her four bucks. Had the difference between 90806 and 90847 and they wouldn't help--they wouldn't, they withheld six bucks, whatever the hell it was. It's just crazy. And then they turned to their investors and say see we're saving money. So the biggest problems are Medicare, which started all the post-payment audits. Medicare is the biggest one. So if you're not a Medicare provider, be grateful. Uhm, uhm, but all the, the third party payers are, are doing this. And there's one wrinkle with TriWest that I want to mention cuz you raised the issue. You can be I like to say an in-house provider or an outhouse provider, sorry. If, if you're not, if you're not a part of their, their in-house panel, uhm, you will not be, you will not be audited for eight sessions. You are allowed to do eight sessions without review. And so there's a therapist that I work with who's in San Diego who sees a lot of, a lot of CHAMPUS patients governed by TriWest where she, she commits in writing that everything about them with the exception of child abuse reporting and stuff like that are mandatory will be protected because she only does eight sessions and CHAMPUS doesn't review the first eight sessions. Well that's true. It doesn't review the first eight sessions. It's if you want more than eight sessions, it'll review. And she stops at eight sessions. But what she didn't count on was a post-payment audit. And a post-payment audit came way after she'd stop seeing somebody and they wanted her charts. And what she did was she paid them back all the money that CHAMPUS had paid her for these patients so that she could commit--keep her commitment to the patients that she would keep their confidentiality and not turn their charts over. That's how firm she was in her belief that she needed to maintain her agreement with the patients that their charts would be protected. And the policy of the insurance companies is if you don't want us to look at the charts, send us back all the money. And, and pay that we don't do something worse to you. Yeah? 

04:23:50
UNKNOWN Did they sign a waiver of confidentiality when they send . . . 

04:23:55
STEVEN FRANKEL I'm sorry, couldn't hear. 

04:23:55
UNKNOWN Do you waive confidentiality when they sign for insurance. 

04:24:00
STEVEN FRANKEL Yes, as it turns out that what happens is when anybody signs up for any insurance plan, they waive confidentiality. They, they authorize the insurance company to obtain records to do audits. That's a normal part of getting any kind of mental health coverage. 

04:24:15
UNKNOWN Now do the insurance companies report the conditions? 

04:24:15
STEVEN FRANKEL Yes. The insurance companies are not entitled to see psychotherapy notes--that's under HIPAA-- uhm, for, for deciding about whether to pay somebody or whether to authorize more sessions. But they're allowed to see clinical records to do that. And with audits, they, they're now fighting to see if they can get psychotherapy notes. 

04:24:40
UNKNOWN How are you distinguishing the psychotherapy notes from the regular notes? 

04:24:45
STEVEN FRANKEL Uhm, I'm using HIPAA language. Under, under HIPAA, a clinical record is all what we have to keep. Psychotherapy notes, we don't have to keep at all if we don't want to. And if you look at what the statute, what HIPAA says about psychotherapy notes, it is incomprehensible. Uhm, if you were trained a long time ago like I was or you were a social worker, a psychotherapy note is, or, or you're an analyst, uhm, a psychotherapy note is, is, or a process note. They use those two words interchangeably, a psychotherapy note and a process note are the same thing under HIPAA. Uhm, a process note is a, a narrative record that articulates dynamic forces operating within a patient and how they play out in the transference. That's what a process note always was. Under HIPAA, we don't know what the hell it is and we don't know what, what a psychotherapy note is. It's whatever you want. But the patients by law are not allowed to see it. You don't, you can keep it from them and you can keep it from the insurance industry if it's about authorizing more care or paying you for the care that you've rendered. Uhm, but now Medicare is trying to get access to psychotherapy notes if you keep them. 

04:25:50
UNKNOWN Clinical records are what? 

04:25:50
STEVEN FRANKEL A clinical record is the usual stuff that you write about patients. Uhm, if we have time at the end, I'll show you a sample of my clinical records and a psychotherapy note that I generated to see if I could do it. Uhm, so, so let me go on. Ah, I've already talked about being nice for co-pays. We call it being nice. Insurance companies call it fraud. Ah, treating managed care patients for private fees. In times past, I would never have given you the advice I'm about to give you. In times past, I would say that if some--if you're a provider for a ma-- third party payer and one of their insured's contacts you and says I want to see you privately. I don't want to involve my insurance, my insurance at all. I would have said you can't do that. Don't do that. You're in breach of contract. What I say now is call the insurance company and say one of your insureds, and I'm one of your providers, has asked to see me on a private paid basis. I have a way to save you some money. Ah, can I see this patient in my own private practice without involving the insurance? And if they say yes, you document who you talked to, what they said and what the date of the conversation was and then you see the patient because insurance companies are into saving money and making money. Uhm, okay. Fraud, ah, I've already told you about the supervision documentation problem that we had in California. Uhm, civil suits and licensing board responses, ah, let me do the CV's piece cuz that's, that's the one that I think's important. If, if you keep a CV, a resume, take a look at it every two years and when you review your CV or your resume ask yourself if somebody who didn't like me and wanted to hurt me got my CV or my resume and wanted to check out every references I put on it to see if I did those things, are any of these things iffy? And if the answer is yes, get them off. Take them off. Take them off the CV because we are having trouble at many level, uhm, with people who are having stuff on their CV's that they can't document, that they can't verify and when somebody really wants to come after you and get your CV and fin--contacts every person that you mention and every agency and every facility and every training problem that you say you attended to see whether you were there, you want to make sure the answers are all yes that you were there. All right. I want to talk about malpractice suits. And then I want to talk about board actions. This is a quote from Senator Al Franken: "Mistakes are human. Appreciate your mistakes for what they are, precious life lessons that can only be learned the hard way, unless, of course, it's a fatal mistake, which at least others can learn from." 

04:28:35
[sil.] 

04:28:40
STEVEN FRANKEL A malpractice suit begins when you get a notice. Somebody says I'm going to sue you and different states have different laws. In California, you have to send a certified letter that says 90 days after you get this letter, I'm going to sue you. It's to give you time to regulate your bowels and all that stuff. You want to look at the statute of limitations for, for malpractice suits in your state. They vary state to state to state. Some states are, are very primitive and have lousy statute of limitations that basically says a year from when the person discovers that you did something wrong, they can come after you. That basically is forever. There's long-term vulnerability. Other states say a year from when they figure out that you hurt them but under no circumstances longer than eight years. That's Washington state. So every state is different, so you need to know your state's statute of limitations and, and see whether the patient has missed their opportunity to file in time to satisfy the SOL, otherwise they are SOL and they can't sue you anymore. Uhm, you contact your, your malpractice insurer and tell them. You will be greeted by a clerk who will begin to ask you questions that will make you very upset and angry. I tell you this because it happens all the time. Somebody says I don't want to call my insurance company. They ask me these questions and it's awful. And then I feel awful. What's happening is insurance companies survive and thrive to their cap--to the degree that they can predict risk. The more they know about what risk factors are operating out there in the world, the better they are at making money, okay. So the clerk asks you questions like was this a child patient? How old was the child? Was an adult involved? Were they not involved? Did you do collateral, not a collateral? They aren't questioning your integrity, they're trying to find out what risk factors are operating here so that they can keep their database up--upgraded. So you call your malpractice insurer. They will send you an attorney. The attorney--you know what a managed care provider for us is, right? A managed care provider is somebody who discounts their fee to get a contract to get patients referred to them by man--by a managed care company. Lawyers who do malpractice defense are managed lawyers. They discount their fees to become lawyers who represent the, uhm, the insureds, which would be us, by the malpractice insurance company, okay. And the malpractice insurance companies all the shots as to what happens in a malpractice activity. So you meet with your counsel. You review your records. Do not change your records. Do not alter them without saying I am altering it on this day because there are companies that make a lot of money detecting what's called spoliation of records, meaning somebody spot two years of records in a weekend. It's been known to happen, lots, in our field. Somebody doesn't keep record and then they get a threat for a suit and they write records. But there are companies that can analyze the ink on the page and when it was written and all that kind of stuff. You want to keep records and you don't want to change them. Uhm, you meet with your defense counsel. You try to give the information to your, your counsel about--you don't--well let before I get there. You don't have to work with the lawyer they send you. If you don't like them, you can tell them I don't like this person, send me somebody new. But you have to work with somebody they appoint unless you want to pay out of pocket for your own counsel. So if you don't like the lawyer they send, tell you--tell them to send you another one until you get somebody that you, that you feel better about. But you have work with somebody who's part of their panel. Uhm, you talk with the attorney about information about the case and you also go through your records with the attorney and you also give the attorney the names of people who you recognize are experts in the part of the field where you are working where the case that you're working on is involved. You want the best-regarded professional you can, even nationwide, to be an expert for you and you want your attorney to know who that is. Uhm, generally not a great idea to talk about it with other people. It doesn't make you feel good for very long and it makes people wary of you, uhm, because we are wary of colleagues who get--bad things happen to them. We, we are that way. Uhm, most cases settle out of court but there are post-settlement problems. And the major post-settlement problem is that when a case is settled out of court, the court gets notified-- the court, the, the, the board gets not--notified that the case has taken place. There is a building in Boston. The building is called The National Practitioner Data Bank. It is owned by the insurance industry. All the records of the insurance companies of professionals who have had insurance-involved cases are stored in the National Practitioner Data Bank in Boston. When a case is settled and the insurance company writes a check, no matter whether it's for a buck or whether it's $20,000, $50,000, $100,000, doesn't matter. It goes into the National Practitioner Data Bank which sends a letter to your licensing board. Hello board, this professional who has a license in your state had a lawsuit. That's when things get really uncomfortable. Because up until that moment, everything's about money. It's not about you. It's about money. And what happens next is about you. So I'm now going to talk about licensing board actions. 

04:34:05
UNKNOWN Can I ask you a question? Does the public have access? 

04:34:10
STEVEN FRANKEL No, the public does not have access to the National Practitioner Data Bank. Some of you may remember the Old Testament story about Moses, uhm, who is raised as a quasi-brother to the future king of Egypt. They were raised as, as brothers and pals. Uhm, in those days in the land of Egypt, Moses' people were held as slaves by the Egyptians and they got pissed off, as slaves will do. And they, ah, they contacted Moses and said, WTF, we're, we're tired of being slaves. You have the ear of the pharaoh, the king. Do something about it and do it now please. We're done. And Moses sort of lights up. He finally gets it--what's going on and he talks to the pharaoh and the pharaoh says no way, you know. Slaves are good for us. We like that. Uhm, and Moses says please don't do that. Please let my people go and pharaoh says no, I ain't going to do that. So Moses calls God and says God it's Moses. God says hey Moses, what's up with you. And Moses says God, listen, my people are being held and, and your people are being held slaves in the land of Egypt and I'm calling you because I don't know how to get the pharaoh to let us go. Thought maybe you could help. No kiddin, really? He's keeping you slaves? Well let's see. Uhm, the problem is that--I mean I could talk to him but I'm not his god, see. I'm, I'm your god. So, so I got a credibility problem with him and so I figure that, that I need to show him how powerful your god is before he'll pay attention to me. So let's see what I'm going to do. I got it. I'm going to send some plagues. I'm going to do some stuff that'll get their attention and let them know how powerful your god is. Ready? The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to turn the Nile River into blood. And everything in the Nile River is going to die. That'll get their attention. Thanks God. No problem Moses. I got your back. Okay. God turns the Nile River red, blood, things die, fish die, everything dies, vegetation dies, Moses says, Pharaoh see, my god did that. Let, let my people go. He says no way, no way. Okay God, didn't work. What else you got up your sleeve? Well I got, uhm, eight more of these plagues that they get and more harsh as we go up until they take me seriously and if they never take me seriously after eight more plagues, I'm going to do the big casino. I'm going to kill all their firstborn. That'll get their attention. So the next plague I'm going to send is frogs. Frogs will fall from heaven. And get ready cuz they're coming. Thanks God. No problem. Frogs fell from heaven and then came locusts, your rain and all kinds of stuff. And the pharaoh just never got it, never paid attention, never worried about it. Ah, and so God finally sent the last of the 10 plagues. He killed all the firstborn of the Egyptians and pharaoh let him go and God parted the Red Seas and the rest is history. Uhm, if you get contacted by your licensing board ever, ever, ever, ever, think frogs.

04:37:30
STEVEN FRANKEL Your career, your self-esteem, your everything is on the line. This is, this is about who you are. So here's how it works. Your state is not likely to have a statute of limitations which means you're board has the legal right to initiate an investigation any time it learns of anything that's suggested you did something wrong as a professional except if you're a Californian. There's a statute of limitations in California and I, I won't share it with you now but there is a statute in California and it's, uhm, it protects you after roughly 10 years after you've last seen an adult and it protects you after a minor that you've seen turns 28. You're, you're safe from a licensing board forever once your patients have reached those statuses. But in other states, there's no statute of limitations on a licensing board action. Uhm, which means you have to keep your records forever. That's one of the implications of that. If you have no statute of limitations on a licensing board action, you don't shred your records. Even if the law in your state says you can shred them after X number of years, don't. It's your only way of telling your side of the story. Frogs. The complaint is usually downloadable from your licensing board's website. The complainant fills it out, sends it to the board. The board does a streen--screening review, making sure it's to the right board cuz most states have different forms of therapists, different licenses, different licensing boards. Uhm, and then make sure it's written in understandable English instead of schizophrenize or som--or written by somebody who's decorticate. It has to be understandable. Uhm, and they have to also determine that even if it's true, it's, it's--something is wrong, uhm, because if, if, if it's true and there's nothing wrong, they don't--they drop it. So they throw it out. Once they get all that screen review done, they then begin to get an investigation. And they'll have a board expert who'll be a colleague of yours, ah, telling them yes, you need to do an investigation. The board will investigate in one of two general ways. It will either send you a letter saying a complaint's been received and what's up with you? You have to make a response to the complaint. Very often they will ask for all of your records. Uhm, and so you do a written response to their, to their letter. They will--they should be sending you releases so that you're free to disclose the information about the patient. The other way to do it is they may ask you to be ev--interviewed by an investigator. Uhm, an investigator is somebody who is a nice person. Investigators that do board investigations are nice people. Number one, it's not street cops. They're, they're, they are, they're not doing street cop work. They're, they're board investigators and, and they're very nice for two reasons. One is that they're nice. The other is that they know two things about us that lead them to be very nice. The first thing they know is that we are the most passive-aggressive people on the planet. Mental health professionals are really passive-aggressive. Somebody messes with us, we want to jerk them around like there's no two ways. I mean, we are really impossible. So they don't want to piss us off. Uhm, and they're not going to throw us up against a wall and put us in a hammer lock and say we have to spill because we'll make their lives miserable. Ah, the second thing they know about us is that we are among the most codependent people on the planet. And if they say listen, I, I'm a licensing board investigator and there's a complaint about you. I got files coming out my ears. I'm overwhelmed with work. I think I can put this away with a couple hours of your time. You can bring a lawyer if you want but I don't think you really need one. Uhm, so I've got a problem. I need your help. And we go problem? Help? I do that. And then we talk. That's not the response. The response is the next call you get will be from my lawyer. Let me have your contact information and your--you have a lawyer. Uhm, so those are two form--pathways for an investigation. And once this information gets to the board, the board reviews it and has an expert review it and tell, and answer the following questions that the board asks. One is if these allegations were true about you, would they be a departure from the standard of practice, standard of care, and if they are a departure from the practice of the--the standard of practice, are they a simple departure or an extreme departure. And if there's a lot of simple departures or one extreme departure, the board can launch, ah, an accusation. And some state boards have some leeway where they can actually negotiate a probation with you without revoking your license first. Some states will revoke your license first and then negotiate a probation with you. Uhm, if they file an accusation with you and don't close the case, almost all the cases close after the investigation because most of the complaints about us are not well-founded. And, and we, we stand up very well relative to other learned professions this way. But if they go to an accusation, life gets really bad. Uhm, because now you're facing either contesting it and going to a hearing. And if you're in what's called a small state, which means there aren't a lot of therapists, the board will hold the hearing and you'll, you'll be there with your attorney at the board's meeting or if you're in a big state where there's a lot of therapists, it'll be an administrative law judge. And you go to a hearing and it's determined as to whether you did something wrong or not and depending on what you did, if it was wrong, they may revoke your license. If they revoke it, they may stay the evalu--revocation and put you on probation, uhm, where there will be terms and conditions. Sometimes they'll--in some states, they'll work out a probation with you and, and not revoke the license first. It very, very much depends on which state it is. If it's a state where there's an administrative law judge, the administrative law judge writes a recommended decision like I told you earlier and doesn't have the power to decide the case, only to recommend what the board decides to do. So that's the way licensing board actions work. Uhm, they are hard to appeal if a board takes action against you and does you dirt, ah, it will be very difficult for you to win on appeal. The grounds for appeals are very, very narrow and hard to meet. Uhm, board insurance. Many malpractice insurance policies that you may have may not cover board actions. This is bad. You'll want your insurance company to cover board actions. The reason they don't cover board actions or they don't cover it well, because some colic--policies come with either a $2,500 or $5,000 limit on board activity, board actions. This is not enough. You want it because it, it--they don't cover it very well because number one, it's relatively rare. Relatively few of us have board actions, less than 1% of the professionals of the professionals in the state have an action against them each year by the licensing board. Those are incredibly good odds. So I'll remind you of what I said this morning. Ah, keep your anxi--anxiety in check a little bit because the probability that--is that you'll never hear a discouraging word from your board. It's just that if you do, it's awful. Uhm, what can I tell you. So, so most, most insurance companies don't cover it at all or cover very little of it because it isn't malpractice. Malpractice is you damage somebody, they sue you for damaging them, money is given to them if they can prove that they're right, and, and the insurance company has to pay them. With a board action, you, you can have a board action against you without hurting anybody. DUI. You get a driving under the influence thing and a board--if you have a series of them, the board's going to take your license. You haven't hurt anybody but alcohol involvement or chemical dependency is substantially related under the law to your performance as a mental health professional. And so the board can come after you for that even if it doesn't involve patient care at all. And so the insurance companies, because it's rare and because they don't have to pay damages to anybody in particular, uhm, offer you a little bit. But, but you want more. I pay $75 a year for $50,000 worth of board coverage. $50,000 a year of board coverage for $75. That's cheap. That's incredibly cheap. And it's cheap because it's rare and because even if I do something bad and I lose, they don't have to pay the plaintiff any money. It's not, it's not being sued. I'm being acted against by a licensing board. So there is an article that used to be on the website of one of the big malpractice insurance companies and it is now gone. I think it's gone. Let me see if I can find it. Because if they still have--if they don't have it, I will send it to you if you want it. 

04:46:30
UNKNOWN Same with the malpractice. 

04:46:30
STEVEN FRANKEL Same, same-- let me, let me, let me first see if they have it up. 

04:46:40
UNKNOWN Can you address professional limited liability . . . 

04:46:40
STEVEN FRANKEL I'm sorry, I can't hear you. 

04:46:40
UNKNOWN Can you address professional limited liability companies? 

04:46:45
STEVEN FRANKEL I'd rather not. Uhm, there's, there's one that I think nobody should have an insurance policy with. And their name begins with Philadelphia. 

04:46:55
UNKNOWN No, no I mean, ah, being registered as a professional limited liability company. 

04:47:00
STEVEN FRANKEL Oh, I see. I see what you're asking. Hang, hang on. Let me, let me see if I can do this first. 

04:47:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

04:47:15
STEVEN FRANKEL I'm sorry? 

04:47:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

04:47:16
STEVEN FRANKEL Hang, hang on. I can only do five things at a time. Hang, hang on. 

04:47:25
[sil.] 

04:47:30
STEVEN FRANKEL Yeah, they changed the website on--in the middle about late October. And this thing is gone. Unbelievable. The best article in the world on mental health malpractice insurance was written by a woman named Margaret Bogie, B-O-G-I-E. And this company had her article on their website for years and years and years. And now they don't have it. Uhm . . . 

04:48:00
UNKNOWN Robin Bogie? 

04:48:00
STEVEN FRANKEL Pardon? 

04:48:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

04:48:05
STEVEN FRANKEL Margaret Bogie. Margaret Bogie is her name. Let me try one other thing. If they still have it, if I can find it, I'll direct you to it. And it's 25 pages long. You can download it and read it. It is all about mental health malpractice insurance. It tells you everything you ever needed to know about malpractice insurance. It covers board stuff. It covers if you're an agency employee. Uhm, it, it, it covers the whole territory. It's very, very thorough. If I cannot find it, then if you want it, you can email me and I will mail it--email it to you cuz I have it. It's, it's a terrific article and it doesn't even look like this page is loading. Oh well. The, the article is written by a woman named Margaret Bogie, B-O-G-I-E, and it is about mental health malpractice insurance and since I can't get it, uhm, if you'll email me then I will email it to you. It tells you everything you need to know. Yeah? 

04:49:05
UNKNOWN Is it not unequal enforcement under, under the law if, ah, say, ah, the insurance, ah, medical licensing board wants, ah, to make a complaint against us but that if we file a complaint against the, the licensing board, against say a licensed, ah, a clinician supervisor setting engage in criminal or, ah, conduct or criminal conspiracies, ah, that, ah, the licensing--or that the insurance company or the managed care company is the agent where they've done harm to patients or to us. We make a complaint against them. The licensing board gets contacted and say, I'm sorry, we don't touch that because that's a jurisdictional issue, ah, between, ah, one agency and another, ah, agency. So, so we, we have hands-off policy. Why is that? 

04:50:00
STEVEN FRANKEL Ah, it's because they can do it and get away with it cuz nobody's ever filed a lawsuit that's, that's, that's done anything different to them. Okay, I can't find the article. So if you want the article on malpractice insurance, email me. I will send it to you. It will tell you everything you need to know forever about malpractice insurance. Okay, uhm . . . 

04:50:20
UNKNOWN Limited liability. 

04:50:25
STEVEN FRANKEL Limited liability companies. All right. Let me respond to that. They're not available for mental health professionals in California. In some states, they are available. A limited liability company is something that's a cross between a sole proprietorship and a corporation. Uhm, and here's how it works. The way that the, the limited liability company works, law, law firms are incorporated, are, are organized as limited liability companies. What--it's a way of protecting the principals in the company from personal action against them by a dissatisfied patient or client. And, and that's how they work. Many states have them available for mental health professionals. There's nothing wrong them. The problem is that when you form a limited liability company, the probability is that you have the pay the state at least $800 a year just to keep it alive. And so you may not want to spend $800 to keep your limited liability company alive when you can accomplish the same goals of protecting you from litiga--liability by having malpractice insurance. That's what malpractice insurance is for. It's, it's to protect you from a dissatisfied patient or client filing some sort of lawsuit against you and wiping you out. That's why, that's why we carry malpractice insurance for. 

04:51:45
UNKNOWN In Arizona, it's $50 one-time fee. 

04:51:45
STEVEN FRANKEL And it isn't an annual fee? Okay, so maybe there's an advantage to it. But I'll tell you who to talk to. The person to talk to is an accountant. And what you want the accountant to tell you is what are the advantages and disadvantages of an LLC as opposed to a sole proprietorship, as opposed to a professional corporation. Those are the three most relevant and entities, ah, that you, that you can form as a business organization. So you want, you want the accountant to tell you because so much of this is a matter of money. It's a matter of how much does it cost to start it? How much does it cost to maintain it? What does it really offer you, ah, that you can't get other ways? But the accountants are the ones to answer those questions. Yeah? 

04:52:30
UNKNOWN Our board, in our state, the board makes the decision. And then if the person wants to appeal, then they go an administrative law judge. 

04:52:40
STEVEN FRANKEL Then they go--after appeal they go to . . . 

04:52:45
UNKNOWN Their, their, the appeal from the board decision is to the administrative law judge. 

04:52:50
STEVEN FRANKEL Oh, so the board--an administrative law judge comes after the board acts? 

04:52:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

04:52:50
STEVEN FRANKEL That's interesting. 

04:52:50
UNKNOWN And, and many of them are not board friendly. So we find many of our decisions overturned. 

04:53:00
STEVEN FRANKEL That's really interesting. That's exactly the opposite of what happens in California. The, the AOJ's, uhm, liv--make a living writing recommended decisions to boards. It doesn't look good on their record if they have many, ah decisions that they write that the board's overturn. So they tend to be board friendly. Uhm, so I hadn't heard that, that any other--anybody does it this way. That's interesting. Does anybody else have a state where, where it happens that way? Do you know? 

04:53:30
UNKNOWN North Carolina too. 

04:53:30
STEVEN FRANKEL North Carolina happens that way too? That's really interesting. Okay, yeah? 

04:53:35
UNKNOWN I just want to follow up on that one question that I have. Cannot a lawsuit be brought against the state in, ah, and a state license board, ah . . . 

04:53:40
STEVEN FRANKEL Yeah, the answer is yes, you can bring a lawsuit. Would you win, I have no idea. 

04:53:45
UNKNOWN . . . in federal court and whether or not you know, ah, if people that do that, that . . . 

04:53:50
STEVEN FRANKEL I, I don't know anybody who does that. Call . . . 

04:53:55
UNKNOWN . . . attorneys that, ah, practice law in the federal court for unequal enforcement of the law? 

04:54:00
STEVEN FRANKEL I don't know anybody who does that. What I do know is that if I wanted to start that, I would start by calling the state bar association and telling the bar association, I need a name of a referral for a lawyer who would file a federal lawsuit against a state agency in California for violating--pardon? 

04:54:15
UNKNOWN And the insurance company. 

04:54:20
STEVEN FRANKEL Whoever. 

04:54:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

04:54:21
STEVEN FRANKEL Who--whoever. 

04:54:21
UNKNOWN Okay. 

04:54:21
STEVEN FRANKEL That's what I would do. I would call the Bar Association. Yes? 

04:54:25
UNKNOWN What is the statute of limitation in California? 

04:54:30
STEVEN FRANKEL The statute of limitations on a board action or in a lawsuit or . . . 

04:54:30
UNKNOWN Both. 

04:54:30
STEVEN FRANKEL Both. Okay, in California, the statute of limitations for a lawsuits goes like this. For adults, it's three years from when you did the bad thing you are accused of doing or a year from when the patient figures out that they were harmed, whichever comes first. So if you, if you, uhm, you do something that somebody reacts negatively to and they figure it out right away, they have a full year. If they figure it out within the first year, they, they have a full year. If they figure it out within the first two years, they have a full year left. Uhm, if they figure it out two years and six months after it happens, they only have six months left because it hits a ceiling of three years. That's for adults. For minors, it's . . . 

04:55:15
[sil.] 

04:55:20
STEVEN FRANKEL . . . for a minor, it's three years after the minor turns 18. Sorry, strike that, strike that. For, for minors for a lawsuit in California, it's three years from when the bad thing happened or when the child turns eight, whichever is last. I'll explain that. Let's say I work with an adolescent population. I'm seeing a 14-year old. I do something really bad to this 14-year old adolescent. The adolescent is weirded out. The parents have three years to file a lawsuit against me. Let's say I work in a therapeutic nursery with funny little kids. And one day a really funny little two-year old waddles out of my office and is terminally weird. That's a V-code. Uhm, and how long, how long does that parent have to sue me? When the child turns eight cuz that comes last. Three years, the child would be five. But this legislature gave them another couple of years there to, to figure out what the hell happened to the kid. Uhm, with a board action, it's really complicated. For adults, it's seven years from the time that the ba--from the time that the bad thing happens unless the bad thing is sexual, in which case it's 10 years from when the bad thing happens and three years from the board finds out, whichever comes first. That's for adults. For minors, it's 10 years, it's three years, sorry. For minors for a board action in California, it's seven years from when a minor turns 18 unless it's about sexual stuff, in which case it's 10 years from when a minor turns 18, which means when they turn 28 or three years from when the board learns about it, whichever comes first. Okay. Yeah? 

04:57:05
UNKNOWN You mentioned you paid $75 a year for $50,000 of coverage for complaints to the board. Uhm, does that company that you use, ah, have name and do they cover MFPs (inaudible ) 

04:57:17
STEVEN FRANKEL Ah, I don't they do. This--my company doesn't. Ah, it only covers psychologists. But the American Professional Agency covers everybody. It, it's called the American Professional Agency and you go to americanprofessional.com, one word americanprofessional.com. They cover every one of the mental health professions, including psychiatry. Yeah? 

04:57:40
UNKNOWN When you get cash up front from a client, do you still have to-- and they have insurance--do you still have to give a diagnosis, sign a form and have notes or a record? 

04:57:50
STEVEN FRANKEL You are supposed to keep records of every patient that you see regardless of whether they're paying you cash or whether they're us--using insurance. 

04:58:00
UNKNOWN Either way? 

04:58:00
STEVEN FRANKEL Either way, we keep records. We are required by law and ethics to keep records. 

04:58:05
UNKNOWN And what about if they're--he either wants to come in as malpractice. Can you do that? 

04:58:10
STEVEN FRANKEL Say that again? 

04:58:10
UNKNOWN Someone supervising, they want to take, ah, a mal--ah . . . 

04:58:15
STEVEN FRANKEL Medicare. 

04:58:15
UNKNOWN A malpractice client--Medicare. You don't want to take Medicare. Can you do that? 

04:58:20
STEVEN FRANKEL You, you . . . 

04:58:25
UNKNOWN I mean, can you just say, I don't see Medicare patients? 

04:58:25
STEVEN FRANKEL Uhm, you can certainly say I don't see Medicare patients. You are free to not see Medicare patients. But you cannot see Medicare-eligible patients either. In other words if, if you are working with somebody who is of Medicare age eligibility . . . 

04:58:40
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

04:58:40
STEVEN FRANKEL . . . but you're saying I'm not a Medicare provider, there's a big problem. If Medicare finds out, they will be wanting to talk with you. 

04:58:50
UNKNOWN Can Californians pay their own provider? 

04:58:55
STEVEN FRANKEL You have to become a provider first. 

04:58:55
UNKNOWN Oh. 

04:58:55
STEVEN FRANKEL In order to opt out of the program, you have to opt in and then opt out and then you have to re-opt out every two years and you have to have every patient that you see that's Medicare eligible sign a contract that says I know you opted out and you're not in Medicare. 

04:59:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

04:59:10
STEVEN FRANKEL MFTs, uhm, and, and professional counselors, you're not eligible to see Medicare patients and your professional societies don't want anybody to know that you see them. 

04:59:20
UNKNOWN Huh? 

04:59:20
UNKNOWN What? 

04:59:20
UNKNOWN What? 

04:59:25
UNKNOWN What? 

04:59:25
UNKNOWN Wow. 

04:59:25
STEVEN FRANKEL Uhm, oh my. What, what have I said. Ah, MFTs--we, we haven't had professional counselors in California so what I'm about to say has to do with an interaction I had with an AMA--AMFT attorney. One of the big questions that I get asked a lot is since MFTs are not eligible to see Medicare patients, can they see Medicare eligible patients at all? Can they see them for private practice fees because if they're not eligible to see them for Medicare program? Uhm, and, and, and the professional societies for MFTs have been trying to get MFTs to become Medicare eligible providers for years and Medicare won't accept them. Uhm, I know that there are many MFTs who see elders and provide therapy and, and assessment for elders who are Medicare eligible and charge them private practice fees. I know that's true because I know some of the ones who do that. I called AMFT and said I'm a lawyer and psychologist in California, talked to one of your people about wha--what's your position about whether a--whether MFTs can actually provide any services legally for Medicare-eligible patients. And the person I spoke to who was one of their--is one of their attorneys said, well we, we try to not talk about that a lot. And I said, well sounds like what you're telling me is that if it became widely known so that Medicare got it that their patients are being seen by MFTs who are charging private practice fees or even discounted fees, when MFTs can't be Medicare providers, you guys would have a problem. He said well, maybe. And so, and so basically it's one those don't make noise and, and say it out loud too much because we're afraid the whole apple cart will get really upset and MFTs will, will not be able to see Medicare-eligible patients ever, uhm, if it gets public. And I, I called Medicare and asked the question and the answer depends on who answers the phone. It, it, I've never seen a, a, a less-distributed knowledge base in my life than the people that work for Medicare. It's incre--it's incredible. Uhm, it's just incredible. And then there's another question about Medicare and that is if you see a Medicare patient but you have opted out, you've opted in and you've opted out and you get them to sign the opt out contract, can charge them your full ou--your full outpatient rate, or can you only charge them what Medicare authorizes? And I've heard both answers. So I, I, I'd be reluctant to, to give you a recommendation. Try calling Medicare. Yes, yes, yes and yes. Real loud. 

05:02:10
UNKNOWN Not with Medicare but CareFirst. So someone wants to not use Medicare because the high profile doesn't want to have a track, a trail. Uhm, I don't have to call CareFirst and say can I not do this. I can just charge my patients. 

05:02:25
STEVEN FRANKEL That's, that's with CareFirst? 

05:02:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

05:02:30
STEVEN FRANKEL Okay, so you don't have to call and get permission or anything like that. You can . . . 

05:02:30
UNKNOWN Well that was the question. I, I know you were talking about that with Medicare . . . 

05:02:35
STEVEN FRANKEL With Medicare. 

05:02:35
UNKNOWN I'm asking about the other insurance companies. 

05:02:40
STEVEN FRANKEL Medicare is a federal program and I know a lot about it, or, or I think I know a lot about it, depends on who I talk to. I don't know about the, the, uhm, the company that you described. I know a lot about the third party payers, ah, where if you want to see somebody for your private fee and you are a provider of theirs and the patient is one of their insureds, you can't do that unless you get permission. And you have to call them to see if you can get permission to see them privately. Because if you're one of their providers, and an insured of theirs wants to see you, you're bound by contract, on the face of it, to, to provide them fee--to, to provide your services within the policy. And--but I'm suggesting that you call the company and say I've got a way to save you some money. And see if they'll let you see them privately. 

05:03:25
UNKNOWN Well that's only good for (inaudible ). They have a problem and they want to see you in private (inaudible ) 

05:03:35
STEVEN FRANKEL That's correct. But normally when somebody comes to a private practicing therapist, the therapist will have an intake form that says what's your insurance. 

05:03:40
UNKNOWN However, I have in my intake form, if you supply me with insurance information and the provider says you are their insured, then I will bill your insurance. If you don't want to . . . 

05:03:55
STEVEN FRANKEL That's fine. 

05:03:55
UNKNOWN . . . just check this box and sign your name and date it. 

05:03:55
STEVEN FRANKEL That's fine. Just, just keep breathing. Uhm, well what, what you don't want is for somebody who, who is insured by one of these programs and that hasn't disclosed that to you to then file a complaint about you. Uhm, nothing bad would happen because if they really didn't disclose unless they lie when they called the insurance company. If they're that mad at you that they'll lie to the insurance company and say that they disclosed that, but if you have a form and they check the box no, you, you're in pretty good shape. Good idea. Yeah? 

05:04:25
UNKNOWN What if (inaudible ) CMHC . . . 

05:04:30
STEVEN FRANKEL I need you to talk louder. 

05:04:30
UNKNOWN You want the microphone? 

05:04:30
UNKNOWN What if you're working on a CMHC and we have people coming in all the time and don't want to use any insurance (inaudible ) and they, and they're--do I have to call the insurance company or . . . 

05:04:45
STEVEN FRANKEL If you are a provider for the insurance company . . . 

05:04:50
UNKNOWN But it was (inaudible ) 

05:04:55
STEVEN FRANKEL I'm not sure what, what you're . . . 

05:04:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) health center. If they come in to the community health center and I don't want to use my insurance. Is there any obligation to call and say . . . 

05:05:05
STEVEN FRANKEL Yes, I would say that, that under all circumstances, no matter whether community health center or whether a private practice, a call is supposed to be made. 

05:05:15
UNKNOWN Without revealing their name? 

05:05:15
STEVEN FRANKEL Without revealing any names, right. 

05:05:15
UNKNOWN Even if you're out-of-network and have nothing to do with the insurance company? 

05:05:20
UNKNOWN If you have noth--if you're an out-of-network provider, then you don't have to call the insurance company at all. You see your patient, you give them a bill, they pay you money, goodbye. 

05:05:30
UNKNOWN You spoke earlier about the, ah, notes, your notes . . . 

05:05:35
STEVEN FRANKEL Ah. 

05:05:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

05:05:40
STEVEN FRANKEL Yes. I will show you what my notes look like. 

05:05:45
[sil.] 

05:06:05
STEVEN FRANKEL I did these consistent with HIPAA because I wanted to see what, what it would look like. Uhm . . . 

05:06:15
[sil.] 

05:06:25
STEVEN FRANKEL This is what I've used for, uhm, a clinical record. This is what you have to keep. So patient name, date, length of session, the CPT code that characterizes that session. Uhm, they want--this is what Medicare wants you to do so I put it in but I don't do this. You're supposed to write start and finish times. I write the diagnosis I'm treating. I don't write diagnoses I'm not treating. Uhm, Medicare then wants you to indicate what themes you discussed in the session. The best list of themes I know of is Axis IV, psychosocial and environmental problems from DSM-4. So I check off the theme that we discussed in, in the session. Uhm, Medicare wants you to, to indicate progress or regression in treatment. The best way to do that that I've found is to write highest GAF this year and what the current GAF is. That's a statement of progress or regression. Uhm, current meds, I keep a list of what the meds are that are being taken. If there's no change, I write NA. Uhm, if there's a change in dosages, I write the new dose of that medication and then NA after that. Uhm, interventions. Uhm, I write things like, ah, did exposure session for PTSD flashbacks or something like that. Ah, risk issues assessed. If a risk ish--risk issue comes up, I write what the issue was, suicidality, whatever it is, what the intervention was, where we are, that kind of stuff. Consultations I, I write the fact of a consultation and anything that was important that came out of it. And then informed consent issues that came up that session get documented there. Ah, these are just, these are electronic lines on a piece of electronic paper. If I want to write more, I write more. If I want to write, I write less. So, so I'm, I'm a sparse writer. Uhm, I had an attorney that said your records are rather skimpy aren't they doctor? I said well it depends on what you mean by sim--skimpy counsel. I, I can tell you that every category of information that my professional, ah, my professional societies and so on want me to cover gets covered in what I write. What you're saying is that I don't write enough to please you. Uhm, I write enough so that people who want to know what I do with my patients know what I do with my patients. Thank you. So , so that's that one. And then-- let me move that off to the side. 

05:08:40
UNKNOWN Can we get a copy? 

05:08:40
STEVEN FRANKEL If you're really nice to me and email me. All right. So let me-- cut that out. Don't you know--it's up there, okay. Here's a, a sample psychotherapy note. It says patient name, date, disclosures this session. Uhm, this is--when I was trained, I was taught take what the patient brings you. That's what the patient brings me, disclosures this session. This is what they came in talking about. Ah, interventions this session. Did, uhm, ah, exposure treatment for patient who talked about, ah, flashbacks resulting from abuse by father at the age of five, whatever. Ah, patient comments--then patient comments and behaviors. That's where I write the boundary stuff or I write revelations that the patient had in the session, anything that--what they got out of the session or the, the, ah, boundary stuff goes there. And I sign it and that's that. So tha--those are--this is a HIPAA-compliant set of forms. If you want, you can combine them and make them into one form. It's--there's no reason that they have to be separated. But these are the topics that I think are important to cover and they have passed muster in courts. Ah, and it's, it's work out just fine. 

05:10:05
UNKNOWN I have a question about minors. 

05:10:05
STEVEN FRANKEL Sorry? 

05:10:05
UNKNOWN In California, at what point can a minor (inaudible )? 

05:10:15
STEVEN FRANKEL In California, a minor can, can authorize their own treatment at the age--hang on, hang on-- of 12. Hell with you. Uhm, at the age of 12 in California. 

05:10:35
UNKNOWN What if they're below that and I find out there's sex going on between two minors. Do I have to contact not only my clients but the other parents too? 

05:10:45
STEVEN FRANKEL I'm sorry. I'm distracted. Give, give me a second to get this up and then I'll focus on what you're asking. 

05:10:55
[sil.] 

05:10:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

05:11:10
STEVEN FRANKEL You're signed up for--until 3:15 I'm told. 

05:11:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

05:11:20
STEVEN FRANKEL That's not my problem. That's Jeff's problem. I, I sent it. They have it. 

05:11:25
UNKNOWN Oh. 

05:11:30
STEVEN FRANKEL Ah. Okay, I'm not going to worry about it. Uhm, say it again. 

05:11:35
UNKNOWN Okay, in doing sex therapy, I found that someone who is age 12 or under even-- is having sex with another child. Do I have to not only tell the parent that--of the child I'm seeing but also the parent of the other child that's not my client? 

05:11:55
STEVEN FRANKEL Sex between . . . 

05:12:00
UNKNOWN Two minors. 

05:12:00
STEVEN FRANKEL Two minors. 

05:12:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

05:12:00
STEVEN FRANKEL It's--call to CPS and let them . . . 

05:12:05
UNKNOWN Call CPS? 

05:12:05
STEVEN FRANKEL Call CPS and tell them to guide you. They'll tell you what to do. Yes, yes and then we're out of here. Yes. All right. Go ahead. 

05:12:15
UNKNOWN I practice in a state that has a parity law for the last 18 months and it's (inaudible ) . . . 

05:12:22
STEVEN FRANKEL Okay. 

05:12:22
UNKNOWN . . . of all the third party payers. So, ah, it's a systems-- if he sees a primary care physician, is he required to, ah, report all the information that prior to that mental health practitioners had to. They no longer have to. 

05:12:40
STEVEN FRANKEL That's really good. Good for you guys. Makes life a lot easier. 

05:12:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

05:12:50
UNKNOWN We can't hear. 

05:12:50
STEVEN FRANKEL You've got to talk really loud. 

05:12:50
UNKNOWN We didn't hear a thing that she said. 

05:12:55
STEVEN FRANKEL Sorry. Text messaging. Uhm, like email, text messaging is not a great idea to do with patients because you only have the printed word. And there is more room for misunderstandings when you're using the printed word than when you're using telephone or video conferencing software. 

05:13:15
UNKNOWN Can you please address supervisor's (inaudible ) 

05:13:20
STEVEN FRANKEL Address . . . 

05:13:20
UNKNOWN Liability of supervisors. 

05:13:20
STEVEN FRANKEL Liability of supervisors. Yeah. Uhm, here's the story on liability for supervisors. Someone who is truly a supervisor who has responsibility for what a, a supervisee does for a case, who follows the case over a long period of time, who knows the patient's identity, who sees the patient's charts and records is--that supervisor is liable for what the, what the supervisee does. And it turns out--and this is what's awful-- they're liable for what the supervisee does even if the ho--supervisee has sex with the patient secretly. And there are two cases that were, that were, that were decided, the first in Alaska, the second in Washington state and they follow each other. Uhm, the rule for supervisor liability is that the supervisor is liable for the things that a supervisee does within the scope of their employment, okay. And so a sex with a supervisee case came to the court and the, the supervisor's lawyer argued it is not within the scope of employment for my supervisee to have sex with the patient. The patient's attorney argued if the management of transference failed and that was what resulted in, in the sex, it was within the scope of employment. The patient won the suit, okay. Uhm, what I can tell you about the best way to deal with supervisor liability. The, the--first of all, there, there are two articles. There's, there's an organization called the National Register of Healthcare Practitioners in Psychology, pretty public website. National Center for Healthcare Prac--Providers in Psychology. They have an education section with free articles. You can download them and read them for free. If you want to get credit for them, you have to take a test. There were two articles on supervision that are superb on the website. And you can just type in supervision in their education section and find them. But here's, here's the big deal. Uhm, it's really important that a supervisor have some source of data about what's going on in the therapy other than the student's verbal report. That's the critical issue. It's the supervisor-- if the supervisor relies solely on the student's verbal report, supervisee's verbal report, they are ways in which a supervisor can miss what's going on. If the supervisor tapes a session, ah, video's a session, sits in on a session, ah, something where they have data that are coming not through the supervisee but from the patient, the supervisor's in a much safer place legally because they're in a position to be able to have a firsthand look at what's going on between the supervisee and the patient. So if there's any one single thing I can tell you that, that is helpful for helping for liability purposes, it's that. It's that there is some data source other than verbal report from the student, Uhm, or from the supervisee. The other thing I'll tell you is that the difference between a supervisor and a consultant is that a consultant's opinions do not have to be followed by the consultee. A supervisor's opinion must be followed by the supervisee. Uhm, that's what the law says. Reality is reality, but the law says that. Ah, the law says that a consultant is somebody who doesn't follow the case over a long period of time, who doesn't know the patient's name, hasn't seen their chart, consults on issues. And, and a supervisor is somebody who knows the patient's identity, sees the patient's chart, consults on not simply on issues but on all aspects of care. And the more somebody is a consultant, the less liable they are for what the consultee does and the more they are involved, the more supervisor they're likely to be seen by the court. That's that piece. 

05:17:25
UNKNOWN What's that website again? 

05:17:25
STEVEN FRANKEL Sorry? 

05:17:25
UNKNOWN What is the website again? Sorry. 

05:17:25
STEVEN FRANKEL It's the National Register for Healthcare Providers in Psychology. Yeah? 

05:17:35
UNKNOWN Can you tell us where to download your, uhm, telephone and email. 

05:17:40
STEVEN FRANKEL I'm sorry. I can't hear you. 

05:17:40
UNKNOWN Can you tell us again where to download your telephone and email address? 

05:17:45
STEVEN FRANKEL It should be from the Erickson Foundation conference website. 

05:17:45
UNKNOWN It wasn't on there. 

05:17:50
STEVEN FRANKEL I'm sorry. I didn't do it. I, I sent him--I sent them the file. I, I'm not the one did it. Go to the administrative people. Tell them. The last thing I want to tell you before you go, uhm, goes like this, remember what I told you this morning and several times over the course of the day, we are blessed in the world of learned professions. We rarely have a problem compared to people in other learned professions. The probability of anything like this happening to you is really, really low. Uhm, it's a good idea for you to have at least contact information for any attorney in your state who knows mental health and knows board stuff because board stuff is different than civil litigation. These two areas of law are very different and you need a specialist in board stuff in your state. That's really important. Uhm, other than that, ah, spend a few minutes thinking to yourself, what would I be doing with my life if I weren't being a therapist? Live long and prosper.
