MICHAEL MERZENICH So I'm gonna start by uh… by talking about the goals you might think about for yourself and for the individuals you're committed to helping. And uh… so I'm going to try to be a little bit more practical. Now I'm, I'm a scientist and I don't really have to be terribly practical. You'll hear a lot about me more practical this afternoon. But umm… but I'm trying to be more practical, best of my ability. Some principles of brain plasticity translated to a real life. I'm gonna try to talk a little bit about that. And practical computerized self-help tools, I'm gonna say a little bit about what these are like and how they are designed to do what. And finally, developing and implementing a personal plan to manage your life or think about your brain health and to think about your client's brain health. So what should I do on the path to managing my brain health? It's a little fuzzy to me. Step one. I'm gonna suggest is to think about how you would calibrate yourself. Of course, when you have a patient in front of you, you think about calibrating them. What is it that they, they struggled with? What is it that they are doing well at and how can I think about them as an individual in terms of their strengths and weaknesses? So the first thing you might think about doing when you think about applying the science in your own life or somebody you love or someone you live with or someone you care about as a client, think about how you, you could do a better job of calibrating yourself. You define how you could be a better stronger, more useful, more interesting person, in detail. So if you thought of yourself as sort of being like that (inaudible ) guy, I talked about way in the past and you think, well, here I am, I'm a, I've lived my life to this point and now I suddenly realized somebody has tried to slap me in the face and say damn it, your brain is plastic. Are you making the most of it? So reconsider, whether or not that really whether you can really say to yourself that you are and if you reckon the most of it, your one chance to have a really, really good life on earth. What would you do to make it better? What would I be better at? What would I, what would I try to think about is improvable or changeable in my own life that could make it a better life? That's something that we can, one of the beautiful things about plasticity, it is that it confers in us the power to be a lot better in a year or so, if we just apply our self to it. So given that possibility, why not do that? Adopt a holistic plan of action because when you think about how you would change yourself, it's not limited to one little set of tools or one little set of, of things that you might do. There's a lot of things that you can do because your brain is complexly engageable from all kinds of directions. And commonly, you should think about doing lots of things that could change your, your life for the better and only if you take it seriously and only if you're faithful to it. And then schedule regular recalibrations. So you should be looking at every so often in some sort of systematic way in your own life or in the people, or anybody that you're trying to help because what you're really trying to do is to manage this change, this change processes for everybody's benefit, your own or for anybody you love or, or trying to help. Do whatever is required, in personal effort then. Once you've recalibrated to sustain a further grow, grow your high abilities. So one way to calibrate yourself is choose the way is to go to BrainHQ which is a website I've created. There is a little bit of a commercial thing. And these are actually scores of myself in BrainHQ working over the last four or five months. And my personal goal is to succeed the performance levels of the average 40 year old. That's my personal goal and like my thinking about that is, is that if I'm always superior to the average 40 year old. 40 year olds don't have too much of a chance of developing senile dementia and I'd rather not develop that myself. So I figure that the fact that I can keep with myself within a safe window, that's a good thing. Of course, I'm also interested in other ways that I can increase my powers in operations. So I'm a more effective human being on the planet. I'm trying to do that too. But I'm trying to keep myself safe because I feel like if I'm safe, I can be more useful and more effective in all kinds of ways, going forward. You can see that I'm at the 90th percentile for someone of my age. I'm 75 and I'm actually pretty good in relation to umm… 40 year olds. And that's what I'm seeking. Remember that hundreds of vicissitudes across the course of life and I gave you this long list of 50 years, so thanks. It can, it can add to your personal neurological burdens. And uh… people tend to have something like this happen to them and uh… on one level and in some level they accept it or they get some medical treatment for it that is not really very thoughtful from the point of view of their brain and brain health. Most vicissitudes that occur in life can be substantially overcome if you have the determination and the will to overcome them. So that it can more than compensate, so don't accept the fact that bad things happen to you as, as contributing to your negative, negative side of your life and your fate. Psyche with them. Your brain's plastic. You're given this gift. Don't argue with those, those uh… those (inaudible ) because ultimately, you can throw them out of the deck for the most part. And that's what you want to do. You want to face up to life, understanding it has a potential to overcome most things it will be thought of you, it could set you back or at least be a lot better off, if you pay attention to them. Lots of people have lots of problems in life, I mean, you know, more than six million people have either an MCI or Alzheimer's diagnosis and that's rapidly growing. More than 50 million people have clinical depression diagnosed in their, in their life, sometime in their life. This is in America. More than 50 million people have known they've had a traumatic brain injury at some point in their life. But every, every the zillions of you things happened, four, four million people, last year, we're in the ICU, in the ICU. And in the ICU, you had a (inaudible ) your brain was compromised after a surgical procedure another life endangering situation that sets them back and advances them to dementia. Lots of people have addictions. Addictions is not just in the form of alcohol or drugs, but lots of other forms. And of course, they are expressed by distorted neurology that's not good for you. And brain infections and poisons and lots of other stuff happened. Lots of things happen to us. This is abnormal is normal. Anybody that thinks that there is a class of people that are normal and then there is a, and they're the great majority and then there is people out here that have a history of illness or real problems. That's a fiction, it's a total fiction. Most of us have a history of significant illness or significant problems somewhere. We've been whacked on the head or we've been poisoned or something has happened to our brain that has disadvantaged it for us. And that we have in a modern society, we have many, many, many sources of this. By age 670, the majority of U.S. citizens have had a medically diagnosed and treated psychiatric illness, or a significant diagnosed neurological issue. This is not rare and only have one of these things, the tendency is to say well, poor me. Why me or why everyone? This is what happens in our life, argue with it, fight with it. Do the best, you can, using the plastic resources of your brain to do better with it and not just for you, but for anyone you love. Abnormal is normal. So neurological principles to keep in mind as you work to improve your brain health. Now first, honestly that no one told the brain, it's supposed to compartmentalize its different actions into different neurological boxes. So probably the greatest achievement it made in a lot of ways, you can say, you could say, where it has spent the most efforts spent in neurological medicine or in psychology, since World War II? Where has been most of the effort expended? Well, to a very large extent, it's been expended in defining and putting names on human maladies. Okay, and commonly, those names on human maladies are assigned a process of put in a neurological box. I have a, I have a malady the that's defined in a series of neurological ways and uh… I have to see this and this in this place and I got that. And those lead to treatments that are, that are sort of generally in the whiter (inaudible ) usually out of the box. There is like, just pulls opens his drawer and say, ah, this is one of those guys that needs a blue pill or maybe they need a yellow pill or maybe they need the blue and the yellow pill. But they are doing that on the basis of the definition of the label that's assigned to the condition. No one told the brain about this. No one told the brain. Brain, brain is totally ignorant that this is, this is happening. To a larger extent it's a fiction. So when we made training programs to try to improve the language with (inaudible ) children, I asked the 35 clinicians, that were helping generate the data that I showed you a plot from earlier. I asked them to tell me what they called the kid, what their label was and I said if it's a neurological or psychiatric label. I want you to go to make sure that the psychiatric or the neurologist affirms that correct label. And ultimately, I collected such data from about 4000 children. The 4000 children have received this label, they are trained by a professional therapist using the same standards in training and ultimately, you're gonna look at outcomes in all of these children, sorted by label. There were 21 labels and we ask the simple question, you know, was how was this child identified, what is their response to the child to the training? Okay, for 19 of the 21 labels that didn't matter what they were called. The response was indistinguishable. The child could be called, I don't know. Auditory processing disorder or they could be called dyslexic. They could be called the uh… 17 other things. The brain didn't care. In every population roughly 80 to 85% of children responded to it in a positive way that was significant for the child to standard an era of more difference in the assessments. And about 15% of children, there was a weaker or no response in every category. The labels from the point of view of interpreting what's happening in the brain were largely meaningless. From the point of view of what we were doing. The fact to say the writings were entirely meaningless. I'm just saying the, our tendency to say, I've got this problem in front of me. I got one of those and now I'm gonna treat it, I take in my treatment under the box for one of those. This is fallacious. I don't think that it's fallacious that we commonly think of a problem in terms of what we see in front of us. I said before the psychologist sees the person has depression, I say everyday think about calibrating yourself and be just a little as depressed. So standard cognitive behavioral therapy approach. And that would be appropriate than it is effective by the way. It is a useful thing that when you're depressed that every time you think about it, you say, brighten up a little. It turns out that has a positive impact. It's not, nothing. But in no way in hell to deal with the fundamental distortions of the neurology that are in depression. The only thing that that feels (inaudible ) is poorly is the drug because what the drug does is that it elevates a, a circulating neurotransmitter. It's usually in the modern drug. It's serotonin historically used to be noradrenaline. If you elevate serotonin, gradually the brain will adjust and elevates adrenaline, if you elevate noradrenaline gradually brain elevates serotonin. Serotonin is all about the doctors, the bleakness that's associated with the depression. You can say, no adrenaline is all about the lack of it is all about the lack, the lack of, of brightness or alertness. These two things corrected together can be magical. But they indirectly relate to what the depression actually is. Because actually five or six major sets or processes in the brains are disordered and because they're not corrected when you correct the depression by giving the drug or by what by telling a person not to be so depressed, the consequences is that, that these treatments have marginal effectiveness in many people. And in both cases whether I take strategy one or strategy two, a large proportion of people quickly relax and then they are in depression. On either, they neither need to change their treatment or give them an alternate treatment or blah, blah, blah because basically the target that we define neurologically is not really, not really the right one. You could think of it as being like treating, looking at the tree and saying, well how can I, how can I get more fruit of the tree and saying well, I can think about this tree and uh… maybe I'll get more fruit by doing something you could say above ground. And really what we might need to do is to think about the nutrition and the things that are supporting the tree that are completely invisible to me. That are underground. It's all about improving functional brain systems and not about improving, you could say the most evident where the highest level performance that I'm trying to correct. If I don't have the resources that is to say, critically, if I can't construct building, I need to, I need to have a solid foundation. I need to have all of the elemental resources that can support high level uh… operations. And commonly the problem lies is that it lies with the inadequacy of the operations at elemental level. To cite a simple example. If I can't remember things very well, the common strategy is to practice for memory or to train people in strategies that will help them keep track of things in remembering to work around the fact that they struggled to remember. Now failure to remember is usually not a problem with your understanding what it takes to remember. Practicing remembering when the brain is shipping around information that's in integrated form is kicking a dead horse. What you really need to do is to improve the Fidelity, the accuracy which the brain represents information, it's trying to receive to remember because when it's recorded by the brain in a sharp crystal clear form, it's easier for the brain to put it on a permanent record. So intuitively, I would say well, I should train the person to remember, practice, remember, remember damn it. Well, here is this little trick to learn. Write it down, you take a… But reality is that you want to correct the neurology. You want to correct the true fault in so far as you can define it. Increasingly we know how to measure the true false, find out where the weak links are and correct them. You have to learn how to stand up before you can dance. So all training, useful training is adaptive that is to say, it's progressive. You can't go from a condition in which you're substantially unable to do some complicated or difficult thing by uh… by basically practicing it on that level, almost all useful training is progressive. And one of the critical things about progressing and advancing the operational characteristics of the brain is that the step size matters. Is the ideal challenge size, it's the ideal way in which you move across the landscape. The ideal step size is determined by success. You can train a monkey on a task in which the monkey never makes an error. Nothing changes in the brain. You can train a monkey on the task in which the task where the monkey makes errors as often as not. The changes that arise in the brain are negative. brain actually re-adjust itself negatively to change his processing in the negative direction because it's not getting the answer right. The ideal condition is, is that you get most answers right, but not all. Most but not all. But if you think about controlling difficulty, you want the person always to be challenged, always to be challenged, always to be on the edge of what they can or cannot do, but favoring successful performance. But always challenge so that they can make mistakes. They do make mistakes. That's the ideal. And if you think about moving them across the landscape from what they can do, what they can't do to what they can do, what you want them to do, that, that step size, that controlling, that difficulty level is critical. Big mountains can be climbed one step at a time, of course. It's crucial for your self improvement that you design your task, so you get the answers right most, but never all the time. It's all about getting into that plastic brain health group and that's a condition in which you get the answers right most of the time, but you're always challenged. Things are always serious to you, they always matter to you. A basic principle is nothing changes in the brain in a natural behavior unless it matters to it. Nothing changes unless it matters to it. Our personal experience is powerfully differentiate our neurology. One size doesn't fit all. Substantially, it's all about personalizing your brain health plan based upon evaluating your strengths and especially your weaknesses. So we tend to think that, that person next to me sitting next to me is more or less like me and then maybe in two or three ways uh… they are different. Well actually two or three million ways they are different. But in a lot of ways, that you don't really clearly suspect they are, they are a lot different. And actually your brain, it's very much a personal product that comes out of the positive and negative things that apply to your own life. Everyone has negative as well as positive things that apply to their own life. That's another thing we commonly think well, you know, my life is full of, you know, I had to pull up, that my, my mother was mean. I, I had experience living with, my dad died when. Every one of us has these positive and negative things in our life and uh… the thing is to differentiate, to understand yourself on levels on which you can address your issues, your problems or that again the issues are problems, so the person you love or the person in front of you that you're trying so hard to help. It's about all a better, healthier you, you. It's not fixing someone else. It's not helping someone else. It's helping you. Umm… stereotypy is the enemy. So commonly, I see people in fact I went to an office yesterday and I saw a person actually had a, oh, I don't want to say it, they actually had a exercise machine in their office that promoted stereotypy movement behavior. Now, why the hell would you ever practice stereotypically? When it has absolutely no value to you in, in, in increasing the power of your brain that control your actions. So far better to think about how you can exercise mentally and physically in ways that add rich variety to, to your brain and control of brain, operations by the brain. That's what the brain really needs. A path of stereotypy movement control is a path to Parkinson's disease. That's what it is. Parkinson's disease is a condition in which in your actions, physically and mentally are stereotype in level in which the brain basically does not loses the ability to control and command variations of the movement, to control of movement or performance. And you don't really don't want to heavily exercise your brain doing that. You want to add rich variety in both your physical behaviors and in your mental behaviors. Use your physical and mental exercise time to improve your brain's control of your actions is a similar way to think about it. For everyday uh… I spend about 15 minutes a day trying to elaborate for control of my actions. And I think that's a really unhealthy thing, thing to do. Uh… and I do that in, in a systematic way so that ultimate, I get to all of them. It's important to train at speed. So really good forms of exercise or exercise in which there is variation in the commands of how you move or act or how you operate in thinking and speed. This could be a game that's largely mental activities, but also can be exercises that are expressed physically. So I strongly recommend that people engage in exercises that, that demand you, you respond and you make decisions at high speed. But it's not just about high speed. It's also about low speed. We actually train the brain in a way in which everything, everything and it has to do is, is done at a certain pace. And the brain masterly specializes for that pace and becomes very, very good at it. It has absolutely no generalized value. You want to be good at every speed. Good at every speed and that means to say, you have to consider how you're engaging your brain as a function of speed. Don't neglect speed, most brains benefit being faster and slow. When conditions are right, your brain advances. Change only occurs, I said before, when it matters to your brain, of course. Make all your mental and physical exercises count for you. Plasticity engages competitive processes and if you think about recovery and rehabilitation uh… think about this competition and think about how a stronger would retain ability can win or dominate over the, any, any ability recover a weaker ability. For brain is continuously competitive in its operations. So if I, if I, so I was on the advisory on project in Denmark in which the therapist were trying to train individuals to, to uh… recover their movement control from a history of cerebral palsy. So I'd actually helped them device these programs and construct them, so that I finally go to, this is called the midi program. I finally went to Denmark to see what they were doing. And uh… their basic strategy was to control the movements of the child in three dimensions, to set up a cognitive task or question or a query and the child had to respond by going in three dimensions by movement to, to hit the box to give the response and the answer is that kind of thing or the child would do things like shoot a basketball in three dimensions, hypothetical ball, they look like they are holding, see the image, it looks like you're holding a ball in a hand and shoot it in the basket and so forth. So what happened in fact is when I went there, I was appalled because the child had used whatever movement they could to get there. So they are very distorted in their movement. Thus you saw the, their, them advantaging to disordered movements in order to solve the task or problem. They were actually contributing to the further distortion of the movement, control the movement of the child. And you have to think about these competitive circumstances, never advantaging uh, something that you do not want to win and that's the movement that's going to be concrete to with ever the individual reestablishing in the normal movement or behavior. Give your weaknesses a better chance to win that competition. Probably one of the most important things is that learning on a negative side of life, powerfully contributes to functional decline. So I could use many examples of this. But let's take the example of this guy. He's older and what he's learnt to do is he's learnt that his, he's learnt that his, he's in danger of falling as are many older people. In order to avoid falling he's, he's adjusted his walking and his posture. And commonly what people do is they flex their knees a little bit and walk because they can respond to a little faster they think if something comes in the way that puts them off balance. When as soon as you flex your knees what you're doing is, it greatly increasing the energy demands that come from when just standing or walking. What he's doing is he's calling it walking in a stereotype way. He's shuffling. He doesn't want to be too adventurous when he's walking. He wants to make his walking more reliable because he misunderstands where safety lies. Safety lies in dealing with the unexpected. Because the reason that he's gonna fall when he does fall is because some, something unexpected occurs and the only way you can sustain your ability to come back the unexpected is to deal with variations of movement. He should be training to walk in all kinds of ways under all kinds of conditions. If he steps on a pebble, that should do not be a surprise or a difficulty for him. Because his brain should be able to make automatic adjustments to it. So he's also is looking down to his feet and by looking down at his feet, it means that, if he does is bumped, it does look begin to lose his balance. Everything is good kind of move in front of him at high speed because it's going to be neurovision. The normal situation is to look forward for things that you're looking into the horizon and basically, if you are bumped things move in a slow speed and you're not carried by your eyes in movement to the ground. Everything he's doing is wrong. Everything he's doing assures that he will lose the ability to walk. This man within a year will not be afoot. Someone has to push him around in a chair. And all kinds of ways we do things that progressively degrade our ability to operate at high level. It's not just that we don't do the right things, to practice our violin. We actually do things that drive us, actively in a negative direction. So I talk about this a lot in my book and use other examples of this, but it's important for you to understand how you might be driving your brain in a negative direction or how that person in front of you is struggling in the way they are, might be doing that. Just stop doing it. Umm… control your use of brain-less technology. I know, it's hard, I know, it's hard. So uh… you know, limit how much you watch TV and news, how much time you spend doing that or you're on a device or you know, how much you rely on planning your way around town on a device or, or how, how much you require yourself to always be in a paved sidewalk or using the internet to figure out how to do things. So it's really do not healthy for you to try to figuring out how you can use the machine for your brain. One of the most amazing things to me is that in sort of modern currency, is a notion that we can build smart machines and the smart machines will operate with artificial intelligence and, and will be such a boon to us and it will be a boon to us. They will be able to do all kinds of, all kinds of problems that will be superior to our ability to solve them. But what the hell are we doing in the mean time? You know, what are we supposed to be uh… in the shut down time. What, what is, what is the point of this really? We can see this, the value of this in manufacturing process or we can see the value of this in lots of things. But for our personal lives, where, where this is being driven rapidly, so pretty soon we'll have in a sense a little device on our shoulder or in our eyeglasses and it's gonna see everything that we see and hear everything we see. And it's gonna tell us when to fart. So I swear this is in our future. It's crazy in a way and we're basically removing our self from the direct physical connection that we have with, with the real world. So this is a danger to us. So we've created tools that try to harness the genie. We call that uh… it's the tools, I'm gonna talk about in BrainHQ and these other tools. Scientific learning uh… uh… and the so-called fast forward series of tools and these tools are designed to be adaptive to individualized training difficulty. So they are basically anyone of these sets of tools quickly adapt in difficulty, so that you uh…, so that you're in that performance area in which you're mostly answer is right, but do not all of them. You're always challenged. And as you get better at anything, it gets more difficult. So basically it's ratcheting you up in performance. Uh… hour by hour, day by day as you train. They optimize fast brain improvement. Because we know the science, that underlies the control of brain change. We know how to make brain change deliver it with high efficiency in a training regime. They are targeted both to recover behaviors normalized neurological abilities. So we're not really thinking about uh… getting better at problem solving. So you're finally and beat your grandchild again at a game. Really thinking about recovering your neurology and restoring it to a more normal functional better functional state. The training is commonly customized to address the special needs of patients with different clinical indications. If you go to BrainHQ, there is about 30 exercises that are there, but if you came to the site as a for a clinical purpose then there would be a completely different set of tools that would be applied that relate to that specific clinical condition. Some overlap with the tools on BrainHQ, but there are other things that aren't there. For example, let's say you're a an alcoholic or you have a alcohol use disorder. Then we need to train you in some sense in the context of your, your alcohol use behaviors. So we have stimulus challenges and exercise or completely different would not be relevant to the average citizen. Or maybe you're a person that's uh… that has multiple sclerosis want to talk to you in that needs argue or different. You want to drive training that both tries to restore the integrity of the blood brain barrier to reduce the probability that you have another episode. We also need to uh… apply specific forms of training that relate to the classes of deficits apply more swiftly in a condition like that. Then we need to talk to you as if you're such a person and not as if you're just an ordinary citizen and so forth. So they have to be customized. Extensive to achieve rejuvenation in all brain systems at all brain levels. So if I think about training somebody that has a relatively easily problem to solve, but say a woman that's been through chemotherapy. That's a relatively easy problem to solve, because of the nature of the wounding that occurs. In 25 or 30 hours a person will be indistinguishable from normal or before they went through this procedure. And the, the effects will be longer during basically restores of. But let's say the person has schizophrenia. If they have chronic schizophrenic then the basic training in the form we're now applying is a 122 hours. There is a lot to train with a schizophrenic brain because there is a lots of sources of distortion. So it can be quite complicated that requires lots of different tools. The tools that we apply that you would see from BrainHQ, have all been proven to work. So we basically don't, nothing is provided to anybody. Except in a, in a experimental trial basis until a random assign control trial has been done and we publish data from more than a hundred such trials using these tools. There is more than a hundred trials in a controlled trial setting that are now underway in the world. The clinically supervised or self-administered, that is to say everything the patient does is easily recorded, the individual does is easily recorded then in the software and it's shipped to what we call a clinician portal, so that the clinician can track what the patient is doing and they are comply, they, they can they have a line of communication with the patient, so that they can try to assure their compliance or they can be self-administered and sometimes, it's a combination of the two, the clinician sets up the trial, the patient largely does it themselves, clinician can look at every so often and to make sure that they are roughly on track and then uh… that it's largely self-administered and then they are scalable because all you really need to, to do these things is did we connected to the internet today on a computer on an iPad or, or Android pad or on a Smartphone. So you could do it any where in the world on any, any umm… modern computer that's internet connected. So here is just a representative example of a training task and this is the one I, I did. These are my scores, you can see, I'm not very good at this four task. And I would say in this exercises, just so, you know, there is 60 levels and this is an initial level. I'm going to show you stage one so I could, there would be six of these boxes and they, and they follow what we call an angry bird format. A lot of you have played angry birds, but if you, if you have, you know, that you have a little challenge and you see how you do on it and if you uh… and then uh… usually, you don't do that well, and you try each one of these levels the first time and then you're asked to beat it. You always have the opportunity to beat it. So actually each and each box which is two or three minutes long, you've driven to a higher, higher performance level until you begin like, you reach a point of crossovers where you're making mistakes, touching when you're making those mistakes and then you move to another uh… to get a chance to repeat it. So every, every exercise about 40 times, 30, 30 times a, an hour. We actually measured your performance abilities on a simple task. One of the things about this sort of exercise format is that, is that it's richly, richly provides a basis of what that person can and cannot do over a period of week or a month we have, we very broadly what a person is capable or not capable of doing. The whole idea of course is the ratchet that person up level by level, trial by trial in their ability. And uh… to get them to a high performance level in every one of these sub tasks levels. So what does a task look like? Well, here is, here is a low level I could show that you some action. I say, if you press this start, button, what you've seen this task is you'd see one of these two vehicles the car or the truck will flash for a limited period of time. You have to remember which one it is. A little time will pass, then somewhere in the initial periphery, the sign will flash and you have to reconstruct where it is in place. So that doesn't sound too difficult, does it? But as soon as you get that right, it's gonna get harder and it's quite quickly gonna get to the point where you're gonna make mistakes. So it gets harder in this case on a, on a single level by having the car presented to you for a briefer time because we're trying to drive, improve in a processing speed as you command central and keep track of something is happening individual periphery and then there is gonna be a shorter and shorter level between the occurrence of that stimulus and the occurrence of the second stimulus and then it's gonna be flashed for a briefer periods of time. Now pretty soon, it's, what happened? Right. So it's very easy even on the simplest level on a task like this to make it devilishly difficult. But that's just as just the beginning of increasing the difficulty. Because we can make every aspect of this more difficult. We can make it more difficult for you to distinguish what it is that you're seeing in the center of gaze. We can make it more confusable with the background. We can increase the eccentricity. We can it more and more difficult to distinguish what that second thing is against the back confusable alternatives. Or we look at an intermediate level of the task, this is what it looks like. So the task is more confusable. Now we have two trucks, it's harder to see when they are briefly flashed (inaudible ) seen, and their background is more confusable with the cars and, and you can see now we have lots of foils that aren't the target and, and how the target is out a little bit more eccentric position. Now when we get to the highest level of this task, it's gonna be full of foils. The, the target can occur any where out to the limits of the screen. The task, the, the, the vehicle, they are very difficult to distinguish. Now, all of these is another way of saying is that I'm commanding this and I'm making the decision of what I see in front of me. You begin almost everyone begins doing this in the sluggish way with relatively inaccurate responding, compared to what you'd see at the end. One across this set of angry bird levels. At the top end of the bird level what you're seeing is really remarkable. You're seeing a performance that you would not believe you could achieve when you start it. And when you're doing that your brain is operating at very high speed with very high accuracy and you can demonstrate in a variety of ways, this translates to how you're operating, when you're out of the world again. Now most people don't know this, but when you're 60, people have lost command of about 25% of the world in front of them. They do not see things out in the periphery. I submit that this is primarily because you spent so, so much time doing two things. First thing is spent time doing is looking at screens. Everything important is within the box. Everything outside is not important. So you've become very, very good at forward looking. The second heavily exercised behavior is driving a car. Driving a car demands that you basically command the things in front of you predominantly. You have to also be monitoring things in the outside, but it heavily favors keeping track of the things directly in front of your nose. By the time, you're 80, you've lost half of it. The world has shrunk this way, the world has shrunk, you don't see things out here, and you don't see things up here. That's why older people have traffic accidents. That's why when you train people at this task, as I showed you earlier, people have half as many of them. What you're preventing is the accident at the intersection. People not only see things coming to them from the sides of vision, but now, they can respond to them in time not to have the accident. Now in relation to that what would you do, if you think that you're living your life when you're 60 of having a smaller, being stuck with a smaller screen TV, look at the world in front of you. When you're 80, it's a tiny little thing. Right, I mean, you can open up to that world again and see all of the things that cross the horizon again. This is so important because it's so important that we be continually monitoring the world in front of us and responding to it in an active way because it is contributing to our health and life. So the point these principles, what might a personal brain health plan look like for you? I'll begin by calibrating yourself and repeat it every, every several months is my suggestion. Adopt a lifelong schedule of new skill acquisition. So each time you acquire a new skill or ability to improve one really thing really serious about it. You're engaging the machinery of brain that enclose your learning right. You want to keep it healthy. You want to always sustain learning rate. You want to elaborate your skills and abilities continuously. So I know, we, we, we have things, we get very fond of doing and they are the, the center of our life and the joys of our life to a larger extent, but continue to enrich it. Continue to think, what else could I, what I enjoy doing that might elaborate my the quality of my engagement with the world. Well, that's a life of, a lifelong schedule knew that skill acquisitions are a very healthy thing. Exercise physically in forms that grows the power of your master movement controller, the brain. So we all need to exercise physically. We need to maintain our basically physical operations just like we need to maintain our brain of course. But when you do that think about how you can advantage your brain in the process. So again, if you think about movement physically as elaborating your powers, so better to play a really active game, a net game like tennis or, or uh… even ping-pong than to be in the treadmill that really is. Because now you're exercising, especially if it matters to you. Especially, if you're working in the sets, always to be a little better, the direction of improvement and not just to accept your past skills that you developed when you're 20. Diet matters, obviously. Pay attention to what you bring into the, into your brain and, and make pay attention to nutritional necessity. There is a wonderful series of studies that have been conducted by uh… a guy by the name of Dale Bredesen who's a psychiatrist uh… at UCSF and there is another second appointment at UCLA and basically what he's done as he's looking at individuals of older age who are in firm, mostly have been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and it looks like their nutritional uh… status and he finds uh… that that nutritional status reflects, he can make the series of sort of chemical measures that he can see that it reflects whether the brain is in a growth mode or in a, or in a negative change mode. Highly (inaudible ) what we see are defined the status of the brain. And then he corrects everything by, largely by supplements, nutritionally and he sees strong improvement coming from the nutritional side. So actually doing studies with him and trying to see how strongly what we do is what he does? Also doing a study in Japan in which uh… the scientists are measuring everything older people eat, everything they consume in the course of their live. So everything is recorded and weighed and the nutritional adequacy from the point of view of the brain health is, is defined and then they are given a supplement to the extent to which they need one to make sure that nutritionally, they get what their brain is asking them to provide to it. It might not surprise you that this project is supported by Nestle corporation. Nestle corporation has this dream that they can actually have in Japan a software that photographs everybody's food every time, just photograph in your phone and then they can send you a capsule which gives you the initial substance. Never mind what the commercial reason for this are. When they give the supplement, people are a lot better off. That's the bottom line. They can demonstrate that when people get what they really need nutritionally, they are better off and again we're trying to, we're collaborating with them, them because they are trying to see how synergistically, what we do, operates with what they do. And then reengage with the physical world. I mean, stop walking through the world like a zombie. Just quit it. Start reengaging with it. Smell the roses. We start looking at around what you see. I like to say, ask you to think about the following exercise. In your mind, reconstruct what's on your street. All of the houses, the bushes, everything there. And now you actually get that mental picture, do it in detail. Go house by house and then go, pick a, pick a place, let's say two blocks away where you go regularly, you go by that place regularly maybe on the way to the super market or something maybe to work. And then reconstruct in your mind what's there. Then go look. Go look what's really on your screen. You know, people are generally amazed to discover what's actually on their, on their street that they cannot reconstruct in their mental image. Now we were designed to be masters of our universe. We were designed to understand in detail what all of these background, what all of these background features were that were could be important to us. And yet, we basically look in modern life, we, we lose this ability because we're so distracted. We're so much into Never-Never Land. So reengage with your physical world. Become a master of your personal physical universe and work to grow and sustain that mastery. So I've been walking on my neighborhood again for 50 years and I know where every damn weed is. And I know it because I mentally reconstructed it. When I move across it everyday, I walk across my path and a different path everyday with my dog Doug and I, he leads me generally, wherever he wants to go, I kind of go. But I reconstructed in my mind and when I, when I come back from my, my walk, I spend a minute or two reconstructed in detail going back looking forward, or maybe I started in the middle and I go to the beginning or I start in the middle and I go to the end. But in various ways, I reconstructed it in my mind and over the years, I, I, I can create a very vivid reconstruction of it in my mind by doing this and I can tell you where everything is in my neighborhood in detail. I submit and probably have a better command than any of any neighbors. This is very good brain exercise. It's very good for your brain to do this. As you improve your ability to load your brain with new information, get busy doing it. So when you improve your brain power what you're doing is you're improving your ability of your brain to actually record information again. Now what happens in a normal life is that if you look at a place holder for knowledge it grows until you're about 60 and then it flattens out and when you're about 70, it goes down again. The reason, it flattens out and it goes down again is because your ability to record information and memory is weakening and then it weakens so much that you can't gather information long enough to keep up with the losses. Now the while idea of life is to keep growing. That's really important in an older person. The reason that we're that we're allowed to have, the reason, we live so long is because older people are really valuable in a society. Because they accumulate knowledge. Not just accumulate it, but they manipulate it in their brains in all kinds of ways and crystallize. They come to conclusions about it that are valuable to the younger people in society. You could not imagine a wartime written being led by 25-year-old Winston Churchill, he just can't. He need to be seasoned, he need to know things, he need to have understanding of things. That only comes from accumulating knowledge. When you think about revitalizing yourself, thinking about preparing yourself so that you're, so that you're growing in knowledge and understanding again. So that you never stop growing in knowledge and understanding. So you continue to advance until you lose your physical uh… way. Smell the roses, get off your desk and off the pavement. Spend more time in the real world, seek out its wonders and surprises. It's really important that you think about continually growing not just your cognitive skills or your perceptual skills, but also your social skills. One thing that we discovered when we begin training individuals that to recover their cognitive, so-called cognitive abilities, let's say schizophrenics, people were socially busted. It didn't make their life better. It made them a lot smarter and more capable and we're not so schizophrenic by any definition. But it was still fundamentally not terribly happy. Because they were socially impaired at a level, it was still difficult for them to make a friend, we connect with our family become, develop normal attachments, but they were still strange to other people. When we train them in their social cognition, it all changed. Now everything was a positive. It's really crucial that you, there is a substantial difference in control, in recovering social cognition and social control when recoveries control in these other domains and it has to be in a set separately exercised. Adopt a charitable view of the world. Every time you help, and every time you make someone happy, your brain is actually a major beneficiary. Stop telling yourself you can't, when you usually can. Stopping having someone else or some other device do what you should be doing yourself. Face up to life's vicissitudes by actively and aggressively challenging yourself to overcome them because you usually can. You could use BrainHQ exercises to accelerate and insure positive change. So my add advice to you in some from this day forward is to stop retreating. Just stop retreating, stop doing it. You have this power, you have been given this power. Think about advancing. Reinitiate growing. If you're not growing actively or you're not really, you're just sort of passively moving forward, stop being so passive about it. Be a little bit more aggressive about it. You only have one life really, probably. Try to do a little better job of it. Live life to the advantage of your brain. Thank you very much.

00:51:15
UNKNOWN What questions, might you have for Dr. Merzenich? Come up. And online attendees, please type your questions in and we'll get the questions to Dr. Merzenich. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN Just a quick one. Umm… I'm Mauriene from children's home and we were talk, you were talking about supplements, you know, there is a lot of herbs out there like ginkgo biloba, I don't know, if I'm saying it right, but umm… to improve memory umm… what are your thoughts on that? Do you believe in any of those supplements they sell in the drugstores? 

00:51:55
MICHAEL MERZENICH Uh… I can't, I can't say that I really uh… knowledgeable about every aspect of the science of this. I know that some things have been shown at a relatively compelling way to advantage your physical brain. So, you know, eating cold water fish is an example or the oils from cold water fish. There are a few examples like this where the research is, you can say good enough to be pretty sure, it's a good thing to do. Uh… most of these things not. It's not, now, I can't really say about this particular uh… uh… because I don't really know enough about it. So I could and I don't want to speak from ignorance because uh… but, you know, most of the studies that have been done, done to demonstrate the values of these things just can't fail. That's all I have to say. You can start, you can start studies in, in a very straight way than lots of these things (inaudible ). 

00:52:55
UNKNOWN Well, if you think, it's working, that could help, too. 

00:53:00
MICHAEL MERZENICH No, I do, I do want to say one thing though and that's that, that uh… I'm really impressed by uh… things that scientists like Dale Bredesen have done because what he's done is he looked at the, the uh… this sort of chemical distortions. That's what he's looking at in a, in a brain of an individual. He's primarily focused on people that are (inaudible ) or, or demented and he's had a big impact just by changing their chemistry, by supplementation and these are largely supplements that are, you know, plant derived or naturally derived supplements and it's clear, it's clear that he's having a big impact by using this in commonly as he tries to get sort of chemical profiles mentions about 20 things and he commonly does, so supplementing five or six or seven right things. Now he has what appeared to be very compelling impacts. So you have a feeling that if you did that for almost anybody that's really struggling, you might see some way to advantage them by thinking about their nutrition or by supplementation. 

00:54:00
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:54:05
MICHAEL MERZENICH And again, one thing that we're getting to is uh… we don't. One of the things we're doing is we're, we have absolutely constructed on, on Smartphones. And the apps are designed to measure your ability across time. So let's say that you have specific clinical patient. Let's say that you're uh… you have a major depressive disorder. So what the app does is that it umm… it's, it's asking you like a, like a uh… cognitive behavioral therapist might ask you, several times a day, how you're, how you're doing and you're self-reporting, you're saying, I'm feeling pretty low on a scale of one to five, I'm, I'm a 1.3 or something. I and then, then it's asking you it that same question in another way. It's asking you to do a little play, a little game and in this game, you talk to the computer, the phone and, and you're also responding to things you see in this little game. And it's trying to, trying to measure, an objective measure of how you're doing. So how you respond to things and how you, what valence you give them and how your voice expresses some can actually be a pretty good indication of how depressed you are. Then we have other more elaborate assessments on the app that provide us with an index of the other things and the price that we put every so often that tell us about whether or not you're neurology expressed in the commonly depressive disorder is, or is not up to speed. And now this patient has all kinds of things happening to them. Maybe they've gone to the psychiatrist, psychiatrist give them antidepressant drugs. Maybe they've gone to psychologist, maybe they've gone to the, gone to uh… a clinic and they've had, they've had a form of therapy that's uh… electro-physiologically based, biofeedback based something. Now, we're not really interested in trying to force what we do on to the person. What we're interested in is, is managing what happens to them, to assure that whatever has happened to them is working. One of the things that could happen to them is like to use our tools. That could be the center of their therapy. It also might be adjunctive to other things that they're doing. What we care about is that, that person is getting better and we know and the doctor can know and everyone else is contributing to the therapy can know that they're getting better. Again, this is about managing brain health. It's, and it might be that the most effective strategies will be holistic. They got something really good from this practice of meditation, they got something really good from this biofeedback procedure. They got something good from this psychologist using some cognitive behavior strategy over here. Maybe they used our programs and maybe that really helped. But, but we have the power now, not to just have them come in for treatment go away and come back every so often and say, gee, I hope how you're doing, are you better? But to know whether or not we're across time and reconstructed all. We have the power to close the loop and to manage what happens to every person in trouble like that. I think that's what we're gonna be doing before we go along. 

00:57:25
[sil.] 

00:57:30
UNKNOWN Umm… there is an individual in the current umm… environment that comes to mind for me when you brought up the concept that we all have our own interpretation of reality like my world view is different because of who I've been and all that stuff. 

00:57:40
MICHAEL MERZENICH Right. 

00:57:40
UNKNOWN Certain individual comes to mind that umm… has a pretty big distance between the truth and what he professes to be true and umm… I guess I'm interested in the difference in the sense that you said part of growing is to make your interpretation of reality more accurate and faster and the distance between that interpretation like the crime level in Chicago or whatever. I'm just kind of interested in lots of people say umm… fake it till you make it, kind of stuff and I see this individual kind of using that, trying to create his own reality all the time and there is a whole lot of people who see the world differently. So I'm, I'm kind of interested in, in that distance between reality and what they're doing and then the people who say, be a sales person, just make it happen. 

00:58:40
MICHAEL MERZENICH Right, well uh… you know, in all kinds of things happen across the life that distort our, our forms of reference. So let me just cite a practical example of this that I'm facing. So uh… we, we are very interested in helping children that have a terrible life like I said, so we are doing these various things with these children and uh… we know that up to about roughly uh… age 20 or so we can, they have dramatic differences changes in their, in their, but, but we're also looking at people uh… and we look at sort of the worst of the worst. We've done a study in children in Wisconsin that have all committed a capital crime. They have all killed somebody. Individuals below the age of 20 and first of all you would not believe how damaged these children are neurologically. You would not believe it. They are just not, they are just not, they do not have a healthy organ inside and they are, and they are very, very limited in their performance ability and then you also would not believe how much it can be changed by intensive training. They have tremendous potential to be restored to us. Uh… but let's go forward. Now we're also doing a study and this is being done in collaboration with a, with a psychologist in Duluth, Minnesota and he, he has people from the uh… primarily from the western district of Wisconsin, the federal court and from, this is from northeastern Minnesota and, and western Wisconsin uh… who've been in prison for more than years, federal prison. So these are individuals that have had a long life in which they developed their world view and reinforced it in all kinds of ways. And by the time they've lived a life and you're 60 or 70 years of age, uh… which I suspect the person that you might be referring to is. You've, you've, you've you're adjusting your world view in relation to what you're, your own structures are that are calibration, so you have a miscalibration, you can say based on those world view. So it becomes increasingly harder and harder and harder in an older individual to change that. So one of the really interesting things you see in an old, old, old ex-con is that, you can ask them query them about how they would like to reconstruct their life. And they have a very clear, clear idea what a good life would be. And they have a very clear understanding of the fact that they don't have one and unless they do something they're not gonna have one. But the problem is that their world view is so engrained that it's almost reflexive. And it takes an awful lot now to overcome that. It is revisable, but it takes an awful lot more intensity, you could say to overcome that. To stop them from going back home to their wife and, and whacking her or whatever they do that comes out of this historic world view when they do that reflexly. So uh… at the same time, my, my strong religion is that we should not abandon these people. I mean, they too are the product of our, they really are a product of our own failure to understand how they got into that situation and we've been abusing them all their life. Almost everything we've done in their life and continue to do them for them is making it worse for them. So uh… one of the things I hope is that this science in a broader scheme in will contribute to a social awakening. Will contribute to a better understanding of what we are and where we come from and how the, how, how, how especially people that have a misfortune, unfortunate early life how it is our absolute responsibility to help them. And anybody that has this history to stop blaming these people for that history and to start helping them be stronger and better people. Because we can do that. And if we did that, it would make a big enormous burden off all of our backs. I think what's, what's gonna happen is that we're, generally everyone is going to understand this how the sciences has informed us about uh… about what's happened to these individuals and then it becomes a moral obligation that we do this. With knowledge, we are morally obligated not to let any further uh… any, any group of children go through this without helping them. So we have to completely change how we think about helping the disadvantaged child or the child that's really struggle in life and we have to think a lot more deeply about how we think about someone that offends. Because we've been so wrong about it. That sounds a little bit like a sermon. 

01:03:35
UNKNOWN I'd like to have a nice round of applause for Dr. Michael Merzenich. Thank you so much. Thank you.
