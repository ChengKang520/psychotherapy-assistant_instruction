EDWARD A. DELGADO-ROMERO NLPA is uh, National Latina/Latino Psych Association uh, I'm the president. Mike(ph) says current president as if gonna depose I might be but there are no plans yet. Uhm, but uh, there's several NLPA members here and uh, including Doctor Maville(ph) who's the uh, who is uhm, nice enough to be running the roundtable and uh, caught(ph) up here Doctor Gloria(ph). Uhm, NLPA if you don't know was founded in 1979 as the National Hispanic Psychological Association and Doctor Perdia(ph) has a piece coming out on cultural diversity I think minority psychology about the history uh, of our organization which many of us don't even know. Uhm, but we refounded the association in 2002 as NLPA, and then NLPA is one of the five ethnic uh, national ethnic minority psychological associations, and the mission is up there on, on the screen for you which is to generate and advance psychological knowledge and fosters its effective application for the benefit of the Hispanic/Latino population. Our website is so simple it's nlpa.ws website. Part of my presidential initiative uh, for NLPA is to take a look at the psychological education of Latinos in uh, in psychology from associate degree to Ph.D. We all heard of uh, the educational problems of U.S. Latinos through the educational pipeline. We've all heard of the educational problems of U.S. Latinos uh, and we're familiar with those uh, problems. The dropout rates uh, our epic uh, from pre-K(ph) all the way through graduate school. Uh, a Clinton Presidential Commission form of 1996 referred to Latino education in the U.S. at that time was being at the fault line. And in the 13 years since that report was, uh, was released uh, the Latino population has dramatically increased due to immigration and a young population having many children. For example in Georgia the state where I, where I lived uh, the Latino population increased by 300 percent from 1990 to 2000 and many our school systems were changed seemingly overnight into majority Latino school systems to our the state. Thus the context for all discussions of Latino achievement is that any marker that we have of achievement has to be considered in line of the dramatic increase is in the population to provide an appropriate context. So what do we know in general uh, about Latino students? Uhm, we know in general that research has shown that Latino participation declines at every stage of the educational pipeline, resulting in a saturation of Latinos at the lower end to the prestige hierarchy of academia and a troubling uh, absence of Latino influence at the highest levels and flags, flagship institutions like my own institution of academia. We also know that Latino students tend to be part-time uhm, half of them tend to go to school part-time or more likely to work during college, more likely to be first generation, more likely to be classified as independent and having dependents, and they received lower fiant, financial aid and take higher loan amounts. And as you can imagine these qualities have all been shown to adversely effect timely progression and ultimate attainment of higher education. Explanations of this uh, problems uh, usually come from a deficit model. Certainly people in this room don't need to be told them. Uh, it's, it's, it's top(ph) that the Latino culture doesn't value education that are problems are due to illegal immigration, languages used, gang involvement, lack of parental involvement, and this description of low intelligence to uh, Latino people. Rarely our systemic issues examined or considered such as the lack of Latino and or cultural competent teachers uh, and administrators, repressive and discriminatory policies, staggered immigration of families, forced repet, repatriation of parents of U.S. citizens, anti-immigration and anti-bilingual sentiments were all things that are never considered. For example again in my state less than one percent of the teachers in the state are Latino/Latina themselves compared with 6.2 percent of the students. Yet, rarely is that sided as our, as a cause of our epic drop out rate which has the unfortunate distinction to be one of the highest in the country around 50 percent. Uhm, thus uh, my focus is to examine statistics in the context of relevant and systemic issues. So how much do we know about the experiences of Latino in psychology? The answer is decidedly mixed, despite an emphasis on multiculturalism years of program, years of programs to address this issues and acknowledgement of the need to include Latino perspectives. The progress in, of Latinos in psychology has been limited specially at the higher levels. At the same time psychology remains one of the most popular majors for Latinos at the undergraduate and the doctoral level. So clearly we need to understand this issues in more depth. I'll admit that some of my interest comes from my own education and professional experiences as I have often been the only Latino on my department a workplace. Uh, I think specially upon arriving in New York City that perhaps my life would have been different had we stayed in New York City. Yes, I'm a native New Yorker born in Mount Vernon, New York to immigrant parents from Columbia uhm, and perhaps my life would have unfolded differently if we had not moved to the southeast in the 70's where the reality of Latino immigration is not really manifested itself un, until the 1990's. However, in states where there's significant population of Latinos the, the, the issues are very similar with the educational pipelines. By now we know that the U.S. is undergrowing, undergoing a demographic transformation, we know that currently around 30 percent of the U.S. are ethnic minorities. This chart which I found in the Division 45(ph) reports based on census data indicates that in 2002 14 percent of the population was Hispanic Latino/Latina. And as we know with all kinds of predictions have dire consequences. Uh, it is projected by 2060 ethnic minorities will become the majority barely at 50.4 percent and half of this majority 27 percent of the population will be of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. And I must also know that these predictions as we know are almost, always wrong and that change and growth of Latino population comes a much quicker than predicted. In other words as the la, an editor of Latino magazine once observed, "The civil rights mount(ph) to have Latino people will not be we shall overcome but rather we shall overwhelmed. In visions and transformations APA's uh, produced by APA in 2007 by the Commission on Ethnic Minority Recruitment, Retention and Training in, in psychology task force CEMRATT uh, CEMRATT 2 and the office of Ethnic Minority Affairs acknowledge the implications of these four psychology of this demographic chips. "The rapid," and I quote from the report, "The rapid growth of the nation's population of color will not be evenly distributed in fact most of these growth will occur on the nation's southern and western regions, and the 40 largest metropolitan areas." The pattern of growth will result to an increased human diversity, an increased political polarization. "To respond adequately to such issues, psychology finds it necessary to include in its ranks a dramatically enlarged cadre of persons of color and to ensure that all psychologists demonstrate some level of multicultural competence." And the emphasis in this slide is mine. Similarly Hull(ph) in 1997 predicted that psychology would commit malpractice and become obsolete if it was unable to respond to this changing demographics and cultural realities. A 2007 workforce analysis conducted by APA indicates that psychologists are already working with ethnic minority clients at very high rates. A survey of 20,000 APA members revealed that psychologists had a higher percentage of working with ethnic minorities 86 percent than with other categories such as substance abuse or severe mental illness. Now of course ethnicity and uh, cuts across those things but in terms as the highest uh, category that they report and working with. And this was much more clear with eth, early career psychologist of whom 92 percent reported working with ethnic minority clients. According to the APEC online directory which is the, the, the, the group that uh, regulates the internships and post-docs uh, 11 percent of internships offer major rotations with Spanish speaking population, 59 percent offer minor rotation with Spanish speaking population and 44 percent of post-docs offer training with Spanish speakers. This is all, you could find that on APECS uh, uh, searchable(ph) directory. So I'm not saying that working with Latinos is it, I am saying that it's happening but I'm not saying that it's happening in the competent manner but it is a reality. According to the Princeton Review, psychology is one of the top 10 college majors for everyone in the United States, it's not a surprise to this group. It's easy to see White people are attracted to psychology as a major given the blend of heart and self-science(ph). The mix was of science and practice and the flexibility of the degree. The occupational (inaudible ) states that faster than average employment growth is expected for psychologists which is good for us here. Job prospect should be the best for people who have doctoral degrees from leading universities and in applied field such as counseling or health and those with specialist for doctorate degree school psychology, and it further says opportunities will be limited for bachelor degree holders, something we all know. We all know it's uh, that uh, graduate training is essential in psychology. So at, according to the the CEMRATT 2 report I took a look at uh, the Latinos uh, look at, at Latinos in psychology from 1995 to 2004 and what we see is that uh, during that time period uh, Latinos received 9.4 percent of all bachelors degrees which was a change of that, during that time period of 44 percent. And also I'd like to include the numbers just so that you can see the percentages and the numbers. Latinos also increased in associate degrees in psychology over time. Uh, in terms of masters degree there was an increased but unfortunately during that time there was a decreased of 1.7 percent in the number of Ph.D.'s in psychology. Uhm, and it should be noted at the same time that this is happening during that time period Latinos also at the highest increased which is 13 percent of ethnic minority groups entering this (inaudible ) programs. So we would look, one way to look at the uh, educational pipeline would be like this. Now of course we need to know that this is not a truly uh, longitudinal analysis since this is uhm, just a cross-section of a, of, of during that time but during that time you can see that in every level for every group uh, uh, uh, cross the tops Latino, Whites, Asian Americans and African Americans there is a narrowing in terms of there's less people at each degree which we, we would expect. Now if you look at the percentages you say that's not, that's not too bad uh, the outcome is roughly the same, uh, but if you look at the row numbers then you see where that really manifest itself, for example at the Ph.D. level you end up with 170 Ph.D.'s as oppose for Whites which is 2,141 Ph.D.'s.

EDWARD A. DELGADO-ROMERO  At the internship level uh, during that time period again 2000, uh, 1995 to 2004 the number of Latinos were unmatched and I'm sorry to bring this up today of all days uh, during munch(ph) day uh, is, was increased over that time period to 11.5 percent. Uh, there's also a decline of people, of Latinos entering post-docs which we know will then have a, a relationship to Latinos being able to uh, get faculty positions if, if you don't have a post-doc you may not be able to get a, uh, a faculty position. And then a number of full time Latino psychology faculty decreased uh, about three percent. More recent statistics uh, from the National Council on Education Statistics showed that Latino had the highest percentage of bachelors degree within the ethnicity, seven percent of Latinos got bachelors degrees in psychology. Uhm, that was the highest of any racial ethnic group uh, within their ethnicity, within their ethnicity they also, I, I got about 37 percent masters degrees in education which could also include community school counseling and school psychology. The, the statistics also uh, well, and also 17 percent of doctorates in psychology which again is uh, uh, the highest percentage within this group. Uh, the statistics also indicated that in the professorial the majority of, of professors were Latino men but that Latinas were making the most gains in psychology in terms of professors and administrative positions, and again my research is indicated that Latinos are mostly to be found at the least prestigious institutions and the lowest levels of prestige hierarchy of academia, for example in positions such as lecturers or temporary faculty. So we got a summary from this report uh, that at the doctoral level, the number of ethnic minority graduates has not substantially increased since 1997. For ethnic minorities, psychology's pipeline continues to be characterized by constriction especially at the doctoral and postdoctoral levels. The absence of a significant increases in the numbers of ethnic minority doctoral recipients suggests that the viability of the future ethnic minority psychology workforce may be at risk. So let's talk about Latinos in APA, between 1995 and 2004 the total student affiliate membership actually declined overall however, Latino student affiliates increased to five percent and it was second only to African-Americans in terms of mino, ethnic minority students. For APA members I was able to update the CEMRATT report uh, to the year 2008, so I was excited about that. Uhm, from 1995 to 2008 Latinos increased by 35 percent to a total of 2,0120 members which accounts for 2.3 percent of the membership of APA. Ninety six percent, 96 of those members were fellows of APA which is 2 percent of all fellows. And although a 35 percent increase seems very impressive, the net total gain for Latinos has been marginal. For example of the total number of Latinos in APA has risen from 2 percent in 2004 to 2.3 percent in 2008. In other words gains from Latinos have been also like gains in general. Interestingly enough Latinos constitute 4.7 percent of the governance of APA. The reasons for Latinos being over represented in the governance relative to their general membership of Armani(ph). For certain it has to do with an intentional efforts by many divisions and the office of Ethnic Minority Affairs. However, I understand that the up, over representation of Latinos in governance is mainly due to the fact but the percentage is not over on numbers about first, about positions held so 4.7 percent of positions are held by the Latinos perhaps maybe by certain Latinos or Latinas.

EDWARD A. DELGADO-ROMERO  Thus, few individuals hold many leadership positions and as we know one such member is uh, Doctor Melba Vasquez who's attempting to make history by uh, as the first Latina president of APA. Uh, my general point is that the over representation in governance is wide rather than deep. As you maybe aware APA members recently failed to approve a bylaws change that would have provided seats on the APA council to NLPA, AAPA, ABCI(ph) and (inaudible ) Psychologist, so while positive indicators like the statute, statistics quoted about uh, previously and high profile events like the special issue of the APA monitor in January, 2005 create an error of inclusion, the depth of this inclusion has yet to be determined. According to my own research and terms about the psychological uh, a research literature limited to uh, to, to of, to uh, few journals and, and a few select areas in terms of counseling psyche, vocational psychology and ethnic minority psychology uhm, is UV(ph) consistent results. Over the time period of 1990 to 2008 over major major journals, Latinos are consistently under-represented as research participants relative to their numbers in the U.S. population. My first study examined counseling journals. They found out that only 6.6 percent of Latinos were participants uh, and the journal was Journal of Counseling and Development, Journal of Counseling Psychology, Counseling Psychologists(ph). The second one and uh, was a study on vocational journals and found that Latinos were only 8 percent of the Latinos. Well, uh, on the 8 percent of the research participants in the Journal of Career Assessment, Journal of Career Development, Journal of Vocational Behaviour, Career Developmental, Career Development Quarterly. However, these numbers have to be really interpreted with caution given that over time an average of 52 percent of the articles failed to report racial ethnicity at all. So as you see this is only of the times when racial ethnicity was uh, was uhm, was identified that you get this proportion of Latinos. It is nmy hypothesis that the situation is far worst that this. Uh, and that many of the unreported race, race ethn, the, the, the race and ethnicity of the unreported research participants are, are mostly White participants. Of course the exception to uh, this, this trend is the diversity focus journals, Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development, Counseling Development in Ethnic Minority Psychology, Journal Black Psychology and the Hispanic Journal of Behavioural Sciences, and of which is in, in the audience. Uhm in this journals uh, Latinos were uh, represented as 39 percent of the pop, research population and it was far less likely that racial ethnicity would not be reported. Uh, it should be noted however for anyone who's tried to get 10 year in an academic department that doesn't value diversity but often diversity focus journals uh, although the upmost rigor in quality are often unfairly the least highly regarded journals by promotion in tenure committees and many institutions. 

00:20:20
Latinos in Psychology Summary In the context of rapid population growth the gains made in psychology for Latinos are simply not fast nor deep enough to address the need 

00:20:20
EDWARD A. DELGADO-ROMERO This we have a picture of psychology having made some progress with regards to Latinos but then again when compared with the fact that Latinos have accounted for more than half of the population growth of the last decade. And it, and it's estimated that this, uh, this growth will triple. This progress must be viewed in context. Education in general and psychology specifically is not addressing the issue with enough speed, depth or commitment to make, to address the need and to make a significant difference in the future. These are my opinion. I'd like to propose a few reasons why I believed that psychology is inadequately responding to the strong warnings of CEMRATT 2 and Doctor Hull(ph). Of course there's an entire literature on, on Latino education in general but I'm limiting my remarks to psychology education. These areas of concern are here uh, include problems addressing the real similarities and differences of Latinos. Changing definitions of what it means to be a Latino. Advising(ph) in and mentoring issues that lead to inequality. Latino faculty and graduate students issues affecting them, practitioner issues, lack of attention giving to Hispanic serving institutions and the exclusion of international Latino populations. I'll just, I will discuss each issue and then include with a summary and recommendations. Similarities and indifferences the first area is that psychology does not do a good job and I think gaging(ph) with the real similarities and differences found in Lat, Latino populations, you ask the Latino populations. All too often psychological research and practice uses what Professor Trimble termed tha Ethnic Gloss. He defined that Gloss in 1991 as an overgenerali, generalization or simplistic categorical label used to refer to ethnocultural groups, where unique cultural and ethnic differences found among the groups are ignored. An ethnic gloss presents the illusion of homogeneity were none exist and therefore maybe considered a superficial, almost vacuous(ph) characterization which serves only to separate one group from another. Educational statistics in psychological research often employ ethnic gloss it's not news(ph) to anybody here. For example the used of this gloss makes it difficult to actually, accurately know which subgroups within the Latino category are doing well in education and which ones are very poor. At times this gloss is intentionally presented to produce a better picture of the stative things for example it used to be the case, but when reporting the number of Latino university presidents in the United States. The presidents of the Puerto Rican university system were included in the numbers. Strangely enough the Puerto Rican university system wasn't included for any other count but it was included in this count. Uhm, the used of ethnic gloss uh, obscures problem such as the under representation of Mexican-Americans in the faculty in academia. This aggregated data leads one to the realization that a Mexican-Americans are under-represented in psychology while south Americans like myself are proportionally over-represented. The APA data I presented earlier is at a generic or panethnic level. So although the Latinos compo, Latinos composed 2.3 percent of APA we don't know which groups are over and under represented even though informally within in NLPA we we have our little groups and we all know that Columbians rule uhm, but at the same time that, that, that we must asked for this aggregated data for, for Latinos it should be kept in mind that some U.S. Latinos have in fact adapted a panethnic identity or simply Latinos rather than a nationalistic identity. My colleague uh, Aileen Diaz McConnell(ph) of Arizona State University and I verify, verified this through interviews and phone surveys that there is a segment of the Latino population who reject the U.S. racialize(ph) Black and White thinking and consider Latinos to be both their race and their ethnicity. Uh, previously the census bureau of, just categorized these folks in 1990 as confused. Maybe they just didn't understand. Uh, however when this was persisted in 2000 they wanted to know a little bit more about it so we showed that this is rather than ethnic gloss for some people this is their identity. They identify as Latinos uh, and not further as a White Latino, Black Latino or whatever permutations that uh, that we have today. Furthermore uh, with Latino migrations within the U.S. there are, there are growing populations that have adapted some of the new identities in new places. For example my mother lives in Orlando and she has watched uh, a uh, migration within the U.S. a Puerto Ricans who have gone to Orlando and are growing and successful and they have their own culture apart from uh, northeastern Puerto Ricans and islander Puerto Ricans, and so this a, a, a new group. So psychology tends to ingate, needs to engage with the very real similarities and differences of Latino people without either ignoring or think of differences or exaggerating those differences in terms of stereotypes. Latino culture in the U.S. is constantly changing and evolving in interesting Whites. The related issues the ever changing definition of what it means to be Latino. Keep in mind that the generic term Latinos are creation of the government U.S. government and the official definition of, of what constitutes being a Latinos has changed over the years. My colleagues and I described the many ways in which the term Latino, Latina or Hispanic has been used in the different criteria for being classified or identifying as a Latino. Latino identity has been categorized by various factors such as National Origin, descent in terms of who your parents were. We also positive that personal cultural commitment, professional cultural commitment will be factors, language, language used to be one of the factors if you spoke the Spanish mother tongue which is one of the senses terms, uh, surnames uh, if you had a Spanish surname they will classify you back in the day, uh, or laws or rules some groups at particular uh, rules or laws or exclusions. In an article in the Journal Hispanic Higher Education my colleagues and I presented several different celapsment, selection in hiring case scenarios in which the type of criteria used led to different outcomes. The implication for the selection of faculty and graduate students in psychology is that the types of qualities desired in a potential applicant is related to multicultural outcomes. That is if the main criterion is checking of at demographic box in an accreditation report this kind of battle can't, will have a different impact than the candidate that has a professional commitment to Latino issues. For psychology to have maximum impact in the future we must train higher and retain psychologists who were committed to multicultural competence. In the case of Latinos it means valuing and rewarding Latino psychologist and graduate students who have a professional commitment to Latino issues rather than simply counting demographic check boxes and totting(ph) progress. In terms of advising and mentorship uhm, the book that I have up here is uh, Doctor Gloria is here uhm, probably Doctor Gloria has done more than anyone than I know. Doctor Gloria and Doctor Castillanos(ph) in terms of mentoring uh, people including myself, and I have another one for books uh, the book one she and I wrote in chapter and featured later. But in terms of advising and mentorship issues uh, my thoughts are that Latino students who have a passionate commitment to Latino issues maybe receiving advice that forecloses some rules. One of my concerns is that psycho, in psychology there's inequitable treatment and advisement of Latino students across the educational pipesline, pipeline. Latinos are far more likely than their White counterparts to enter two year college, received less financial aid and more likely to work during school. In general, in psychology Latinos like African- Americans are also directed to the health uh, service provider subfields of psychology ( clinical and counseling in school) according to a manuscript by Fred Leong(ph) rather than the more academic subfields. We know that in psychology like all other disciplines there exist the hierarchy of prestige and that any, uh, in any applied subfield is at the bottom of that hierarchy. Why would students in Columbia advised to pursue less prestigious degrees? Is that ab, aver, uhm, aversive racism or stereotype threat, our faculty and advisers are more comfortable with students of colors as practitioners thus(ph) academics. As a counseling psychologist I know that my field has made extraordinary efforts to teach, uh, to reach out the students of colors and recruit, retain and graduate them. So I know that part of the reason that students are drawn in the counseling is that we work hard and recruiting, uh, recruiting up. Sometimes I think our efforts at diversification become part of the problem. The success of fields at counseling psyche were the, the estimate is that about 26 percent of the faculty are ethnic minority. I believed often provides excuses for other fields not to have to diversify. In my home department diversity is seen as a counseling thing it is not a share value. So I'm concerned with the advising that Latino students were getting and the mentoring that they may not be getting. Also don't wanna leave you with the impression that counseling psychology is entirely hospitable home for Latinos either. I've been critical of the entire villager on predicting which students will become faculty members that is often used in counseling psychology. That whole literature is based on almost exclusively White student population. So we're not even part of the, the, the equation for predicting uh, the behaviours and all that kind of stuff that peoples love to generate. Consequently Latino students are often directed towards practice rather than academic careers in counseling psychology as well. Doctor Manny Cassas(ph) who some of you know or most, most of you know once remarked to me that he was astounded at the lack of Latino faculty prospects. And he wonder where the next generation of faculty were. A concern made all too real by his intending retirement. Terms of faculty issues uh, the faculty and graduate student issues, uh, the issues facing Latino faculty were daunting. Uh, once Latinos become faculty they are more likely to be found in none-tenure positions such as lecturer more likely to be found at assistant professor rather than full professor. Latinos specially Latino men get tenured on lower rate than their White counterparts. A study by the James Irvine Foundation(ph) took a critical leave it, look at the issues facing under- represented faculty in California colleges during 2000 to 2004, out of 1,500 hires there were only 157 faculty of color higher. And out of those faculty the turnover rate was 58 percent, leading to what they term a revolving door for faculty of color. Now as we all know that's not the reality that, that, that, that perception, that perception is that uhm, uhm, faculties are being uhm, the faculty occur being hired unfairly, they're over represented uh, this kinds of things but their lucky, in California was that it is a revolving door and my consent will be is that way in a lot of places. In psychology it's hard to get this kind of information because even though departments collect this data for all kinds of purposes for example APA accreditation reports there's a reluctance to make this data public. What the literature indicates that in psychology there's been a concern about the isolation and tokenization of Latino faculty. In the study conducted by myself and one of my students we found that half the Latino faculty in counseling and clinical programs were the only Latino faculty in their program. A situation Newmann(ph) referred to us solo status which is positively correlated with decreased job satisfaction. Nevertheless(ph) while Latino faculty also relate the great sacrifices that are made to be faculty in training programs that tend to be geographically isolated from family and Latino communities. Latino psychology faculty report facing both over, cover, covered areas to their success in advancement for example one colleague related the story that at a faculty reception, a White faculty colleague asked her if she was hired either because, uh, the White has asked her, "Are you hired because you're a woman or because you're a Latino?" Doctor Sue has termed this type of experience as microaggressions and they can cause Latino faculty and stu, and students to feel invalidated, devaluated and consequently denigrate. (clears throat) I also recall my own graduate training that a fe, uh, fellow group(ph) as graduate student complimented me for not speaking broken English which was uh, which was good, uh, you know which was surprised to me but this kind of daily incurrence just makes me wonder if academia has a good option for folks. Another this microagression are partly the reason I chose to work for the first five years in my career in a counseling center where at least this kind of things could be processed. The book that I am, have I here uh, Doctor Castillanos(ph) is, is one of the editors and Doctor Gloria(ph) and myself have a chapter in this book and several other people do as well, the majority and the minority if you haven't seen it are really good, I suggest that you check it out. It's not just academic Latino psychologists I know uh, as an academic that we become kind of obsessed with what, what things in academia but uh, they're not the only ones who face the hard road. Uh, another one of my students and I examined the burnout level of bilingual, Spanish English psychologists and found that all those Spanish language ability provided a sense of pride and community connection. Levels of emotion exhaustion which is the first step in burnout were high. Most Latino practitioners reported that the training may received in multicultural therapy was too general to apply to Latino populations once they were out of school. Limited diversity and practicum and internship training compounded the problem. Of the few studies available on bilingual uh, Spanish English uh, provide, mental health providers uhm, had already (inaudible ) university, they found that therapist who spoke Spanish uhm, tended to have learned it at home and received limited formal language training. They found that most therapist were concerned over their vocabulary and applying psychological concepts in Spanish. One of our, our Latino or Latina bilingual stu, uh, student joined the program they found themselves being pressured to fill the needs at local agencies in a way that they were not trained for. In my program for example we had a bilingual student who was asked to translate during an intake in a psych, psychiatric consult in the first two weeks of their masters practicum uh, situation which they were neither trained for nor competent to do. There's limited research on the experiences and training needs of bilingual providers. There are some psychological training programs that are attempting to address this needs. Uh, and are included but are not limited to Mount Claire State(ph), Our Lady of the Lake(ph), Pacific University in Oregon, John F. Kennedy in California and Alliance in San Francisco(ph). Should also be noted that not all Latino psychologists uh, Lati, Latino therapists or psychologists are bilingual and those who are not also might struggle with cultural issues, burnout and microagressions. In particular those practitioners were interested in social justice issues may find it overwhelming to work with the staggering poverty in many Latino populations. Half the Latino undergraduates can be found at the institutions collectively known as Hispanic Serving Institutions. Uhm, there are very few APA programs at these institutions for example the ones that are of Carlos Albizu, uh, New Mexico State University, Nova University, Our Lady of the Lake(ph), University of Miami, University of New Mexico, University of Puerto Rico. Simplify in HSI is at, is a school that has 25 percent Latino in Rome and oh, however this is a little more complicated in them. This designation is not a federal one and the designation is fluid given in Romans, changes in Romans. Currently there are ninth, 193 such institutions uh, including a community colleges in 11 states in Puerto Rico. HSI's are located in states where there are high numbers of Latinos tend to be chronically under funded and generally considered less prestigious than other universities. Uh, I wanted to investigate in terms of APA programs and uh, I asked a, a friend who is uh, high up in psychy could they give me the data about psy, uh, psychy at HSI's and they somehow could not find that data for me. Uhm, but anyway it is, there are few APA programs little as know about psychological research using HSI samples and very little known, is known about the transition from HSI's to reshould, research extensive universities. It's odd that so little is known about institutions that educate half of Latino students in the U.S. and there should be more direct connections. The exclusion of HSI's troubling issue similarly the exclusion of international populations in, is travelling as well. One might assume, assume that in psychology was facing in crisis under rapidly growing Latino population or mental health needs in terms of their mental health needs and it might be advisable to turn to our neighbors in, in Central, South American and Caribbean for some help. They have psychologists there in fact it is predicted that in the coming years there will be more psychologists in Brazil than there will be in the United States. However we know that that's not a viable option. Uh, psychologist Geoffrey Arnett(ph) published an article in the 2000, uh, October, 2008 American psychologist pointing out the preventiality(ph) of American psychology. He pointed out that U.S. journals exclude 95 percent of the world's population in terms of contributions, samples and editorial leadership. Similarly, the situation is similar in psychology with regards to millions of Latin Americans in their practice of psychology that exist in this countries. The reason often given is the incompatibility of the models in psychological training. For example that many countries usually European model of education but does not include graduate school per se. And also transcripts that cause headaches for licensing boards. One of my initiatives in NLPA is that has been to reach out to Latin American psychological association and see if we can somehow cooperate and transcend some boards. In conclusion while I was writing this presentation the reality of the financial recession in the U.S. was beginning to manifest itself around the country and then my home state. Stories are beginning to circulate about the negative impacts of Latino populations and specially low SCS immigrant populations. At universities one can begin to see the priorities of universities as funds dry out. In my university the first program is cut where some of our programs (inaudible ) its color. I understand the similar, the situation is similar across the country and also within APA so, so my concern is that the gains that we've made over the last several year, decades in psychology will not stand up in hard economic time. In multicultural recruitment programs are cut and financial aid becomes harder to come by, graduate psychology programs maybe come about, who can afford to pay for them rather than about providing, preparing a diverse profession to work with a diverse clientele. Therefore we must ensure that multicultural models of psychological education are seen as a necessity rather than a luxury. As we have seen over our picture of Latinos in psychology is a mix one. On the one hand psychology of every level of education is an appealing area of study for Latino students and faculty. It's clear that Latino students are interested in careers in psychology and that the profession has acknowledge the need to include Latino people in the future of psychology. However this progress seems to be a fragile one that could easily be undone by loss of a few key(ph) people or programs or of financial crisis. Feeling my uncertainty is that we are unable to ascertain the depth or saturation of Latino influence in psychology and almost all of what we know is that the panethnic level. We're able to articulate the barriers and challenges faced by Latinos at every level of education but must let, much less able to recognize or point to the success stories. Psychology as a profession has to continue to reach out to the Latino population and realize that beyond demographic diversity the inclusion and the incorporation of multicultural models will change the practice of psychology in the United States. In other words it is not a one way enculturation model where Latinos, Latino graduate students, psychologists and clients will simply joined with the existing system as it is. Latinos have several identified cultural values that have been, have been affected by life in the United States. For example research has indicated that Latino students often desire a more personal relationship with their faculty and mentors which is identified as the Lat, Latino cultural uh, value of personalismo, a present, a preference for close personal interactions. Is psychology ready to accommodate and adapt the Latino cultural values as Latinos accom, uh, accommodate and adapt to the values of psychology? In conclusion I returned to the words of CEMRATT 2 report that stated "Psychology finds it necessary to include in its ranks a dramatically enlarged cadre of persons of color." Given the realities of a rapidly growing Latino population in the U.S. and in the world this cadre must include a high proportion of Latinos. As Latino psychologist and the president of NLPA I'll do my best to make that happen but I will need your help. My graduate students at the University of Georgia first heard my talk earlier this week and at the end they, they sat and stand silence. I asked them why they were so quiet and one student ventured, "I'm very sad, you're not telling us what to do and I want to know what to do." She thought about it for a while then she said to me, "Don't you know that this is the age of a bottom and we're supposed to have hope, we need hope, yes we can." I loved the enthusiasm of my students and the warmth and of greetings uh, the warmth of interaction such as at here at the roundtable. Refreshes my energy and helps me keep going. (inaudible ) but it's gonna be hard. Thank you. (applause)
