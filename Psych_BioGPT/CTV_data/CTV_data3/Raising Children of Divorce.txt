EVA LOWE You're getting or have already gone through a divorce, whether you've chosen to get a divorce or your partner is divorcing you, whether you're certain it's the right thing or you're not sure about it. Your most important task is to raise your children in the healthiest possible way. This video is designed to help you with that process. 

00:01:05
DR. PHILIP STAHL Hello, I'm Dr. Philip Stahl. I'm a psychologist specializing in high-conflict divorce and a divorced father myself. I've shared in the raising in my children. I've seen what works and what doesn't. Like all parents, I've made mistakes and I continued to learn from them. Most parents want to their children in a emotionally healthy way and I'm confident that you'll find the suggestions and insights in this video helpful. 

00:01:40
RAISING CHILDREN OF DIVORCE Practical Help for Parents Telling Your Child About Your Divorce 

00:01:50
DR. PHILIP STAHL Once your divorce is in process, your first task is to talk to your children. It's important for both of you to talk with the children if possible and it’s important for parents to talk with one another about how you're gonna tell your children before you actually tell them about your divorce. When talking to your children at this initial meeting, here are some things you might tell them. 

00:02:10
Tell them you're getting separated or divorced and what those two words mean Tell them that you love them and that they had nothing to do with the divorce decision Recognize that they will be sad Comfort them and help them with those feelings Encourage them to ask questions, and try to answer their questions honestly and without blame 

00:02:15
DR. PHILIP STAHL Tell them you're getting separated or divorced and what those two words mean. Explain the permanence of divorce. Tell them that you love them and that they had nothing to do with the divorce decision. Children often believe it's their fault their parents are breaking up. They may feel guilty thinking that they behaved in a certain way that would make your relationship come to a divorce. Recognize that they will be sad, comfort them and help them with those feelings, encourage them to ask questions, try to answer their questions honestly and without blame. Constantly remind your children that you love them. Reassure them that you'll always be there for them. Most children are likely to keep their insecurities and fears to themselves. So it may not be a parent that they need this reassurance. At the same time, it is likely that there will be many unanswerable questions. 

00:03:10
Responding to questions your child may ask "Why don't you and Mommy love each other anymore?" 

00:03:10
DR. PHILIP STAHL Tell them honestly that you don't know everything. Reassure them that you'll work together to find answers to their questions. Well, it's difficult to cover all these examples that children at various ages might come up with. I'll give a few examples of how you might consider responding to particular questions or statements that your child may make. For example, "Why don't you and Mommy love each other anymore?" Your mommy and I used to love each other. We tried real hard, but we just can't live together anymore. I bet you're scared that a love for you may change, but I promise you I won't. In this response, you focused on the fact that you tried, but things didn't work out. You've addressed your child's fears and feelings that's very important. Let's do another example. Why do you always ask me about dad? I'm sorry honey; I didn't know it bothered you. I've tried to stop asking questions about him. If you want to talk about things to go on dad's that's great, but I'll try not to ask about him anymore for bothers you. This is a perfect opportunity to explain that you make mistakes and you're sorry when you do. Help by explaining your attentions, and then honor your child's feelings by saying that you won't ask about things in a way that bothers her. Why are you and mom so angry all the time? Sometimes, it's hard for mom and me to communicate. We really try hard, but the next time, mom and I are angry at each other, tell us how it makes you feel. Let me know how I can act differently. This response shows your child that you're being honest and then you don't have all the answers. It's a very important to avoid blaming the other parent in your answer. 

00:05:05
EVA LOWE Many parents think that their child's only questions are the once they ask in the first month or two of separation. As children grow, their questions will change. Bring up the issue and encourage her child to talk about it. 

00:05:20
DR. PHILIP STAHL Some important things to remember when answering children's questions about divorce is to answer them truthfully without blame and at a level appropriate for your child's age. There are four major principles when talking with your children. 

00:05:35
Four principles when talking with your children 1. Think about your child's statement and questions and answer them directly and honestly 2. Pay attention to your child's feelings 3. Try to read between the lines 4. Define concepts in your children's life 

00:05:40
DR. PHILIP STAHL One, think about your child's statement and questions and answer them directly and honestly. Two, pay attention to your child's feelings, that's very important. Three, try to read between the lines. For example, your child might ask you "Why don't you live with daddy anymore", but they may really be asking "Are you going to stop loving me." Four, define concepts in your children's life. A small child doesn't understand the concept of every other weekend. To help your child in those circumstances, make a visual calendar that marks out every other weekend. On the calendar show, which days are yours and which are his. Don't assume that a child understands everything, because they're not going to. You're going to have your own feelings about the divorce, but you must be sensitive to your child's feelings. It's important to recognize that your child's feelings and your feelings are not likely to be the same. It may work with children of divorce; I found that most children keep their feelings to themselves, unless parents encourage them and give them permission to talk and ask questions. 

00:07:00
EVA LOWE Introducing or encouraging religious beliefs with your children after divorce can be extremely comforting and helpful to them. Because your children's world has been shattered by divorce and it feels as if they're being abandoned. Belief in something bigger than themselves can give them someone to talk to and a sense of security that someone bigger than them and their parents is watching over and will not abandon them. 

00:07:35
How Your Battles Affect Your Children 

00:07:35
EVA LOWE One of the hardest things for parents to do when they're angry or hurt is to put their differences aside for the sake of their children. Children have the hardest times adjusting to a divorce when the parents remain in a high level of conflict and keep the children in the middle of the conflict. 

00:07:55
Relatively low conflict Moderate degree of conflict High level of conflict How Your Battles Affect Your Children 

00:07:55
DR. PHILIP STAHL Research had shown that families of divorce experience conflict in three different ways. Some families have relatively low conflict where the divorced parents generally cooperate with each other are able to truly set aside their differences for their children. A moderate degree of conflict, where divorced parents may get fairly tense with one another. They keep their distance of their children's activities, but they're able to maintain a fairly business-like approach to dealing with the task of parenting. It's very common for divorced families to be at this stage of conflict for the first year or two after separation. The third level of conflict within the divorced family is very high conflict. From your child's perspective, this is the worse. Arguments erupt into violence. Police get called to set off visitation disputes. Enforcement of court orders is next to impossible. These parents may go back to court several times a year attempting to search out an agreement on their differences. Children from high conflict divorce situations worry constantly about whether their parents will create a scene in public. Whatever the level of conflict is between you and your ex-spouse depends on your personality style and the circumstances that arise in your life. It's important to work through your conflict step by step. If you're a high conflict person, don't expect to become a low conflict person overnight, but perhaps a moderate degree of conflict should be your initial goal. I've found that either parent by his or her own actions can actually prevent the significant amount of conflict. It's my belief that the best way to win an argument is to simply not participate in the argument. If you maintain an argument so that you win, your child will always be the loosing. 

00:10:00
Fighting and the Wounds it Causes 

00:10:05
EVA LOWE When conflict is high between parents, children are left with many wounds. Children frequently feel that they've failed or done something wrong when conflicts occur and feel even more insecure when they can't prevent them. 

00:10:20
DR. PHILIP STAHL Children experiencing intense conflict have to take sides. They can't manage the internal tension and anxiety that they feel. For these children, there is a risk of serious psychological regression where they see one parent is mostly bad and the other parent is mostly good. This is damaging the children, because it gives them an unbalanced view of good and bad. In my experience such black and white thinking is destructive, because it produces an inaccurate view of people on relationships. Children are likely to express their emotional wounds in a variety of ways. They might experience regression or act in ways that are more typical for a child younger than they are. 

00:11:05
examples of regression: Bed wetting Temper tantrums Clinging to you Wanting to sleep in your bed at night Aggression Rebelliousness Fighting with their friends or Outbursts at school Withdrawal Depression Anxiety Embarrassment Insecurity Reluctant to express affection 

00:11:05
DR. PHILIP STAHL Some examples of regression would be bed wetting, temper tantrums, clinging to you or wanting to sleep in your bed at night. Your children may exhibit external symptoms such as aggression, rebelliousness, fighting with their friends or outbursts at school. Some internal symptoms in children may include withdrawal, depression, anxiety, embarrassment, insecurity, or they may be reluctant to express affection. It's important for you to recognize that both you're obvious and not so obvious behaviors are likely to pressure your children and cause them to feel our particular way. 

00:11:50
Steps to Reduce Unnecessary Conflicts Watch your children for signs of the emotional wounds we discussed previously Recognize and take responsibility for your own role in any conflict with your ex-spouse Improve your communication with the other parent and with your children Reduce your own role in the conflict by not participating in it When you want something, ask rather than demand Try to develop a routine that will help reduce transition between homes 

00:11:55
DR. PHILIP STAHL Here are some steps you can take to reduce unnecessary conflicts for your children. Watch your children for signs of the emotional wounds we discussed previously. Recognize and take responsibility for your own role in any conflict with your ex-spouse. Try to improve your communication with the other parent and with your children. Reduce your own role in the conflict by not participating in it. When you want something, ask rather than demand. It's important to have an attitude of saying "Yes" to a request from your ex-spouse rather than saying "No". Finally, remember that your children is going to have trouble transitioning back into your home from the other parent's home. Try to develop a routine that will help reduce that struggle and make it more comfortable for your child. Your children will adjust to your divorce more easily if you avoid conflicted parenting. Take the time and energy to develop a careful parenting plan and use that parenting plan as your guide to carry for your children. By doing this, you teach and model for your child, the benefit of problem solving and healthy conflict resolution. 

00:13:10
Develop a Parenting Plan Custody and care of your children When they are going to be with each of you how you will manage holidays and vacations How to handle communication Differences between the two of you 

00:13:10
DR. PHILIP STAHL A parenting plan is likely to include custody and care of your children, when they are going to be with each of you, how you will manage holidays and vacations, how to handle communication and differences between the two of you. Most importantly the parenting plan is going to help be the blueprint for how you raise your children after divorce. 

00:13:35
Conflict-Producing Behavior 

00:13:40
EVA LOWE Conflicts can occur in many areas including attitudes, schedules, extracurricular activities, communications, new partners, and so on. Your behavior has the potential of putting tremendous pressure on your children. 

00:14:00
DR. PHILIP STAHL Some behaviors are particularly likely to add the intensity of conflict your children feel and to make it more difficult for your children to accept and adjust to your divorce. 

00:14:10
Derogatory statements about the other parent Telling children about child-support problems Showing them the letters that your ex-spouse has written Failing to communicate with your ex-spouse and forcing the communication to be through your children Talking about the courts and the judge Asking your children to make decisions about where they want to live Tempting your children with fun activities when they're supposed to be with the other parent Managing Your Conflict Parallel Parenting 

00:14:10
DR. PHILIP STAHL Here are some of those behaviors; derogatory statements about the other parent that's always damaging to your child. Telling children about child-support problems or showing them the letters that your ex-spouse has written. Failing to communicate with your ex-spouse and forcing the communication to be through your children. Talking about the courts and the judge. Asking your children to make decisions about where they want to live. Such loyalty conflicts are always very painful for your child. Or tempting your children with fun activities when they're supposed to be with the other parent. There are many things you can do to help yourself handle your feelings constructively. If you and your ex-spouse have a high level of conflict, you will need to parallel parent your children. In Parallel parenting, you've little or no contact with the other parent. All communications will be written and sent by email or fax and each of you will have to find responsibilities established by your parenting plan. Most importantly, each of you will do the best job of parenting you can when the child is in your care. Don't try to settle conflicts on your own, use a mediator to help. These steps will keep your child from being exposed your conflicts and can reduce your child's attention. If you have moderate conflict with your ex-spouse, you may be able to co-parent to a certain degree. But when conflicts arise, use a mediator, go back to your basic parenting plan rather than risk getting in the more conflict. Always avoid exposing your child to that conflict. If your relationship with your ex-spouse is low in conflict, great, you're doing wonderfully. But if you start to feel that you're getting tense, question yourself as to the circumstances that are causing you to feel that way and find a healthy way to deal with it. 

00:16:20
Developmental Needs of Children Through the Years After Divorce 

00:16:25
EVA LOWE How will your divorce affect your children like many life experiences the effect depends on many factors, but especially the age of the child. Divorce will affect a young child quite differently from an older child. Many children have a physical response to a stressful situation rather than an emotional response. Many times, we're not aware of the physical connection to the emotions. 

00:16:55
DR. PHILIP STAHL When children are hurting emotionally, they often express their feelings through their physical being. Children of different ages might manifest their emotions in different ways through their physical bodies. 

00:17:05
Children often express emotions physically Headaches or stomachaches Trouble sleeping or eating Age 0 to 2 

00:17:05
DR. PHILIP STAHL For example, they might get headaches or stomachaches. They could have trouble sleeping or eating. They may even get sick a lot. You want to recognize that those physical symptoms could be signs that your child is hurting emotionally. During the first three years of life, the foundation of basic trust and relationships is formed. Children in this age group require predictability, consistency, and routine. When divorce occurs during this time, there is a loss that your child feels, but cannot fully comprehend, because your child can't express his or her feelings in words. Your child will express emotions behaviorally through problems in eating, sleeping or self-soothing. 

00:17:55
Eating Sleeping Self-soothing Insecure in relationships Become irritable, depressed, and withdrawn 

00:17:55
DR. PHILIP STAHL They may be insecure in their relationships. Some children become irritable, depressed, and withdrawn in part, because they don't know how to express their loss in words. The major role of parents and caregivers is to provide security, love, support, flexibility, consistency for children who have divorced, who fall within this age group. Children need to know that they're loved and are not going to be abandoned. Children in this age group develop their thinking skills and friendships. They're learning to cope with feelings and are fascinated about everything. If they have secured parenting, they will be ready to go onto kindergarten with plenty of self-esteem and confidence. On the other hand, pre-schoolers are at risk for fairly serious regression when they're afraid of losing one of their parents. Children of this age can became easily confused and they may not understand what's going on around them. 

00:19:00
Age 3 to 5 Toileting Sleeping Eating Irritability or clinging behaviors May become depressed and withdrawn Nightmares may become more pronounced Self-confidence may suffer Increase in aggressive or abnormal behaviors 

00:19:05
DR. PHILIP STAHL They may experience regression in areas like toileting, sleeping, eating. They may experience irritability or clinging behaviors. Some children become depressed and withdrawn. Nightmares may become more pronounced. Self-confidence may suffer and there can be an increase in aggressive or abnormal behaviors. Young children need lots of tender loving care, plenty of hugs and special time with each parent. This can include time set aside to talk about their feelings or to read to your child. Bedtime routines that incorporates soothing and nurturing are particularly helpful. 

00:19:50
Ages 6 to 12 

00:19:55
DR. PHILIP STAHL At this age, children thrive and structure and routine. Many children have a different type of relationship with each parent. For example, your child might be more outgoing and silly with one of you, more quiet and thoughtful with the other. Divorce brings many challenges to children of this age. Younger school aged children tend to feel the loss of the family as a unit. They may experience more sadness and crying. Older children in this age group may be more likely to experience anger. They might choose one parent over the other or feel directly responsible for the divorce. A common risk in this age group is for children to think in terms of good and bad. Some kids begin to reject a parent who they previously loved. People refer to this as alien nation. It's quite common in school aged children to worry about how their parents are doing. They tend to try and take care of their parents emotionally. They may avoid experiencing their own feelings or say things they think their parents want to here, thinking that they're taking care of their parents. 

00:21:00
Supporting their interests Encouraging their friendships Understanding their feelings 

00:21:05
DR. PHILIP STAHL School aged children need lots of reassurance, which can be expressed by supporting their interests, encouraging their friendships, and understanding their feelings. Children of this age need parents to actively support their, love life in relationship with the other parent. These children are especially vulnerable to conflict. Avoid putting your child in the middle of yours. 

00:21:30
DR. PHILIP STAHL Adolescence are developing greater independence and separation from family. Many are oppositional and negative. When divorce occurs at this age, teens worry about the loss of their family life. They tend to feel responsible, guilty, and angry, because they tend to be naturally self-centered. They get frustrated with the way the divorce affects them. 

00:21:55
Age 13 to 17 Academic failure Eating and sleeping disorders Depression Suicide Delinquency Promiscuity Substance abuse 

00:21:55
DR. PHILIP STAHL When you're in conflict, your teen is at greater risk for academic failure, eating and sleeping disorders, depression, suicide, delinquency, promiscuity or substance abuse. To make matters worse, the signs of these symptoms may not be obvious. Your adolescent will find reassurance when you support their growing independence. Rules and routines are critical for this age group. Be available for honest and open discussions. 

00:22:30
EVA LOWE Throughout childhood, both parents need to be involved in a child's daily life. Kids need to have their own independent relationship to each parent at every age. Listen to your child's feelings, make rules you believe in and support your child's relationships with the other parent. 

00:22:50
Healthy Parenting After Divorce 

00:22:55
DR. PHILIP STAHL When parents divorce, it is common for one or both to feel guilty about the breakup of the family. This guilt often causes parents who want to be friend rather than a parent to their children. If you're acting as a friend, it may be difficult to set limits or rules of your child. However, if you're a parent rather than a friend, you will teach your children responsibility and provide a healthy structure and routine. Some parents are afraid to set limits, because they want their child to like them. Stay a parent sometimes you may have to say no to your child at the risk of your child not liking you for the moment. But in reality, you're providing more stability and a healthier relationship with your child. Avoid being a Disneyland parent and overindulging your child. 

00:23:45
The "friend" parent: Sets-few-if any-limits Supports play and instant gratification rather than responsibilities Undermines the relationship the child has with the other parent The responsible parent: Sets responsible limits Teaches self-responsibility Will respect your child's relationship with the other parent 

00:23:45
DR. PHILIP STAHL A few things to remember, the friend parent sets few if any limits. Supports play and instant gratification rather than responsibilities and undermines the relationship the child has with the other parent. In contrast, the responsible parent sets responsible limits, teaches self-responsibility, and will respect your child's relationship with the other parent. 

00:24:10
EVA LOWE When parents divorce and their children spent time in two different homes, it is easy for them to pit one parent against the other. Your child might do this, maybe unconsciously to encourage you and your ex-spouse to be in contact with one another in the hope that two of you might get back together. 

00:24:35
DR. PHILIP STAHL It's easy to worry that your child will love the other parent more than you. You might worry even more when you set limits and your child pushes those limits. Remember if your limits are reasonable and consistent, your child's love and respect for you and his or her sense of safety and security will grow. It's common in divorce for a children who play one parent against the other, but ignore your child's blackmail while still paying attention to his or her feelings. 

00:25:10
Dating and How it Affects Your Children 

00:25:15
DR. PHILIP STAHL Before you begin to date, you need to make sure that your children understand that divorce means the marriage is over. Once you feel your child is clear about your divorce, then it is okay to begin dating. Children have many reactions and worries when their parents begin to date. 

00:25:30
They may worry about whether you are going to still be there for them Worry about whether they will get along with this new person They may be nervous, insecure, potentially very uncomfortable Listen and talk with your child openly and honestly Allow your child to have his or her own independent feelings Give them space and time Reassure them that they will not be replaced Differentiate between dating a little and a serious relationship. Make sure your child knows the difference Remind your child that they are still number one Don't "compete" in your dating life Talk about your dating carefully and discreetly Avoid talking about or exposing your teenage child to your sexual behavior 

00:25:30
DR. PHILIP STAHL For example, they may worry about whether you're going to still be there for them or worry about whether they will get along with this new person. They may be nervous, insecure, potentially very uncomfortable. To help reassure your child when you begin dating, listen and talk with your child openly and honestly. Allow your child to have his or her own independent feelings. Give them space and time. Don't force them to accept your new partner as you do. Reassure them that they will not be replaced. Differentiate between dating a little and a serious relationship. Make sure your child knows the difference. Remind your child that they are still number one. If you've teenagers, don't compete in your dating life. Talk about your dating carefully and discreetly and avoid talking about or exposing your teenage child to your sexual behavior. Remember if you're too much of a friend with your child, it may confuse your child and make it difficult to set healthy boundaries. Your ongoing commitment to your child's well being is vital. Stay alert to signs of physical, emotional, and behavioral distress in your children. Don't pressure your child to choose sides between you and your ex-spouse, instead understand your child's feelings and separate them from your own. Throughout childhood, both parents need to be completely involved in all aspects of their child's life. Ultimately, what your child wants is to feel love and security from both of you. And you can give them that love and security while at the same time taking care of yourself. Well, your children may struggle with your divorce, hopefully these steps will minimize their pain and help them adjust in a healthier way.
