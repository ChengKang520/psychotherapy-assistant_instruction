Counseling Psychologist 

00:00:10
MARCIA LIU Hi. I'm Marcia Liu and I'm a counseling psychologist. I received my PhD in counseling psychology from Boston college, where I focused on the mental experiences of racial and ethnic minorities. I work as a clinician at the New School Student Health Center in New York city and at the veteran's affairs hospital in Brooklyn, New York. I also have a prior practice where I meet with adults for psychotherapy and additionally I teach in the Asian American studies program at Hunter College. 

00:00:40
Cultural Identities in Counseling 

00:00:40
MARCIA LIU As counselor psychotherapist and clinician, it's imperative to discuss and explore cultural identities within the psychotherapy space, including gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, social class, as well as other identities. Each of these identities influence a person's mental health. Their sense of how they relate to the world and their well-being. In particular, it's important for clinicians to be culturally competent and understand and explore issues of identity with people who are women, people of color or LGBTQ identified clients. These minority identity groups have to contend with historical negative stereotypes about them which often result in subsequent mental health distress including anxiety, depression and even self-harm. Thus, it's crucial to discuss ways in which their minority status has influenced their sense of self as well as their ability to achieve and their ability to cope with their distress and this requires is that clinicians have knowledge about these communities as well as self-awareness of their internal psychological experience and skills for working with these client populations. 

00:01:45
Cultural Competency in the Therapy Room 

00:01:45
MARCIA LIU Opening up a dialogue on topics such as race, gender and sexual orientation signals to the client that these topics are welcome in the therapy space. Now oftentimes client fear that the therapist feel uncomfortable talking about these topics, particularly if they identify in a different way than the client does. Clients also may feel that these topics are too political for the therapy space and thus inappropriate for discussion or they may feel that the clinician won't know what to say or how to react if the client does share their experience with them. And the experience of being in a minority identity group are often intimate and misunderstood and silenced in many context and so it's important for the clinician to signal that exploring cultural issues in this space uh… is acceptable and appropriate and encouraged. And moreover, it's important that the clinician demonstrate that they are capable and open and at ease in talking about issues like racism, misogyny, heterosexism and transphobia. These discussions can help the client gain insight in how contextual or external factors may have influenced their experiences and identities and they'll help foster a relationally strong dynamic between clinician and client as well as help the clinician asses how the client psychopathology is potentially impacted by these identities 

00:03:05
Imposter Phenomenon 

00:03:05
MARCIA LIU One particular psychological experience that people of color or other marginalized groups often feel is called the imposter phenomenon. The imposter phenomenon shows up constantly in my clinical work with clients. Whether I'm counseling an older adult veteran at the VA hospital or graduate student at the New School Student health center or even teaching a student in a classroom setting. The imposter phenomenon is a particularly salient psychological experience for people of color and women. The imposter phenomenon was originally coined in 1978 by Pauline R. Clance and Suzanne Imes. They're both clinicians and scholars in psychotherapy and mental health. That's defined as a psychological experience where a person feels that others view them as competent, skilled, adept, savvy, and deserving of their status or position in the community. When in actuality, they themselves feel they are a fraud, undeserving of being there, and quite unintelligent or unskilled inside. Now, whether in a school or a workplace setting, people who experience the imposter phenomenon, strongly feel that they don't belong even though people view them as capable. Instead of asserting that they're smart or talented, they'll instead focus heavily on their work ethic. Noting that all of their achievements are simply because they work so tirelessly or somehow they got lucky rather than their accomplishments being due to their actual natural abilities or inherent intelligence. So people experiencing the imposter phenomenon will often create unrealistic high expectations for themselves. Later feeling terrible when they, when they fail to meet these expectations and the fear that others will see them for frauds, haunts their experience. So for example, some of my clients of color have discussed moments when they felt particularly embarrassed or ashamed after making a comment in a class umm… that wasn't received very well by their instructors. 

00:05:00
Imposter Phenomenon 

00:05:00
And Self-Sabotage 

00:05:00
MARCIA LIU So it may seem counter intuitive but self-sabotaging is a common way to alleviate the pressure of having to perform perfectly all the time and sometimes people will self-sabotage because from a psychodynamic point of view, it actually can give a person more of a sense of having control over their life. For example, uh… if a person of color is nervous about performing well on a test, they may make the decision to deliberately not study and then when they perform poorly on the test, they may feel more in control of this experience and less like a failure because they can say, I didn't actually try to study so that's why I've failed. So though stressful, this can be a preferred alternative rather than studying hard for a test, then performing poorly and then feeling that the reason that they failed was because of their own lack of intellect. 

00:05:50
Clinical Implications for the 

00:05:50
Imposter Phenomenon 

00:05:50
MARCIA LIU From a clinical standpoint, the imposter phenomenon will eat away at a person's sense of self over time, impacting their self esteem as well as their sense of belonging to the community and they may feel alienated and isolated, haunted by this feeling that they will be found out at any point and they can also feel extreme amounts of stress especially if they feel they need to be perfect and in control. 

00:06:15
Examples of Imposter Phenomenon When Working with African American and Latino Populations 

00:06:15
MARCIA LIU So historically black and African American people as well as Latina, Latino people have been associated with stereotypes of laziness and unintelligence and this stereotype often prompts the imposter phenomenon because as they succeed, they have to fight this thought that they succeeded not because of their own skill or merit but because of some kind of random error and these internalize thoughts about their own lack of intellect often have been incubating for several years, reinforced by direct and indirect feedback that they've received from society as well as from their teachers and supervisors and elsewhere. Uh… the idea that they succeeded because they are bright, intelligent and talented is often an idea that hasn't been reinforced to their school and workplaces or in the images they see in the media. It's also important to note that because of many institutional barriers, many black and latino students maybe the first of their families to enter college and this academic experience can carry both pride as well as a significant amount of anxiety related to the desire to succeed and to make the family proud and as a result, these students often feel a great deal of pressure themselves umm… to present as capable and deserving of being there uh… as a way to prove their worth 

00:07:30
Examples of Imposter Phenomenon When Working with Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) Populations 

00:07:35
MARCIA LIU Asian American Pacific Islander or AAPI people on the other hand have been labeled the model minority. A stereotype that asserts that they are intelligent and academically capable as well as submissive and creative and socially inept and because of the model minority myth, AAPI students often feel they should be performing very well, all the time, in school and in work environments because that's what others expect of them but many AAPI students struggle in any number of ways including in academic and work environments as well as with their own mental health distress and similar to black African American and Latina, Latino students, many immigrant AAPI students are first generational college students who grew up with few financial resources and as I noted earlier, first generation college students are under a particularly high degree of pressure to succeed on behalf of your family and to prove that they deserve to be in a college or higher education program. 

00:08:30
Clinician's Role in Helping to Resolve Imposter Phenomenon 

00:08:30
MARCIA LIU So to resolve some of these feelings and behaviors, psychotherapy can be helpful. Clinicians should start with an emphasis on fostering a sense of trust and openness with the client as well as acknowledging that race is an okay topic to discuss in psychotherapy. This demonstrates to the client that you as a clinician has some awareness of racial issues including how it may impact the client's identity and their experience of the world. Usually clients will come to psychotherapy recognizing that they're feeling poorly or noticing they're behaving in ways that cause stress for example chronically procrastinating, avoiding social interactions or excessively drinking or using substances. So the clinician should explore the client's experiences within their personal context. So for example, a student may come into psychotherapy and say they have been doing, they have been avoiding doing any of the work or reading for a particular class. The clinician should find out about what the client's process is. For example, are they going to class, what is the class, how do they feel about the material that they are learning? Socially, how does it feel within that class while they are sitting there? And what does the homework self-actually entail? The clinician should then explore whether this is like a common experience in the student's life or rather whether this is a new phenomenon. Have they had difficulty doing work outside of the classroom in other academic contexts? How do they feel about avoiding the work? Hopeless, apathetic, ashamed, proud? The clinician should also assess what the classroom racial dynamics are, so for example, do they feel aware and some what alienated for being the only person of color in the classroom or one of a handful of people of color within their program. It's at this point that the clinician may recognize the client's hints act of imposter phenomenon. The clinician should explore the client's feelings of being an imposter. Understanding how this feeling may impact their behaviors in the class or at work, their interactions with others and their experience of completing the work. And this will help the clinician get a clear sense of how the phenomenon looks for the client. The clinician should then focus on validating the client's experiences of feeling like an imposter as well as their sense of loneliness and fear that others will discover them. They can discuss when the client initially remembered feeling this feeling. Was it as a child? Has it been more recently in this particular school or workplace and additionally, the clinician should articulate the imposter phenomenon as a common experiencing for many people who oftentimes feel similarly about their position in their school or work context and it's important to explore how their racial dynamics have contributed to the person's sense of being an imposter. This type of consciousness raising can often help a client recognize the external factors that are impacting their mental health rather than viewing their worries and behaviors and perfectionism as completely internally driven and this can shed some of that self-blame that clients often heap upon themselves. 

00:11:30
Clinical Demonstration 

00:11:35
MARCIA LIU In this next section, I'll demonstrate how the imposter phenomenon looks for one client of color. We'll debrief afterwards to discuss what came up for the client and for me during the session. 

00:11:45
Session with Client 

00:11:45
MARCIA LIU So Precious (ph.), why don't you tell me, what brings you in today. 

00:11:50
PRECIOUS Umm… to be honest, it just feels like I'm supposed to be here. I, I've just been feeling really off centered uh… lately. I haven't been really sleeping and I don't really know what's going on 

00:12:10
Therapist establishes rapport, listens, and shows empathy 

00:12:10
MARCIA LIU Yeah, it sounds like, it's been stressful. 

00:12:10
PRECIOUS Yeah. 

00:12:10
MARCIA LIU Yeah. How long has it been going on for that you've noticed feeling this, feeling this off?

PRECIOUS Yeah. 

00:12:25
MARCIA LIU And this is the first time you've had this feeling or does it feel like familiar to other times in your life where you've been like kind of off? 

00:12:35
PRECIOUS It's definitely familiar, I think it just intensified since this new semester. 

00:12:40
MARCIA LIU Yeah.

Understanding day-to-day-life for client 

00:12:50
MARCIA LIU Got it. Can you tell me a little bit about what your semesters have been like? Tell me about, you know, what your day-to-day has been like? 

00:12:55
PRECIOUS Umm… well I'm just starting my second semester at NYU. Umm… that break definitely just, I just really needed that break. 

00:13:05
MARCIA LIU Yeah, the winter break. 

00:13:05
PRECIOUS The winter break, yeah. Umm… and I know lately, it's just been, I've been waking up and I've been really tired. I've just been really, really tired umm… and it's like I wake up and there is just like to do lists as soon as I get up. Umm… I have to go to class uh… I have rehearsal after that and then on the weekends, umm… I'm working at a bar in Brooklyn and it's just a lot, I feel like I spend a lot of the time commuting as well. 

00:13:40
MARCIA LIU Yeah. (inaudible). I mean, (inaudible) class. 

00:13:45

00:13:55
MARCIA LIU Sure. Do you feel that sense of it? Just being exhausted? 

00:14:00
PRECIOUS Yeah and you know, and sometimes I can't sleep umm… yeah sometimes I just can't sleep and I experience insomnia sometimes. 

00:14:15
Understanding causes of insomnia 

00:14:15
MARCIA LIU Yeah, sure. Do you notice what you're thinking about at night? 

00:14:15
PRECIOUS Oh, I just think it's umm… mostly what I have to do the next day and how, how to fit everything in. 

00:14:30
[sil.] 

00:14:35
PRECIOUS Umm… if, if I'm not you know, studying lines, for like an hour I'm doing a paper, a research paper. Umm… or I'm rehearsing with my scene partner. 

00:14:50
MARCIA LIU Yeah. It sounds like you're in theater? 

00:14:50
PRECIOUS Yes. 

00:14:55
MARCIA LIU It's great. How do you feel about that?

PRECIOUS I love it. 

00:14:55
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:14:55
PRECIOUS I love it, I love it. Umm… it's a definitely different than undergrad. Umm… I feel like undergrad definitely set the foundations for a lot of these things that I'm learning now. Now, it's like more hands on, on feet, umm, really understanding the craft more. 

00:15:15
MARCIA LIU Got it. How has it been, let's, let's see, this is your second semester there or either the (inaudible )before.

MARCIA LIU Sorry, should be more clear. With Brooklyn college? 

00:15:40
PRECIOUS Brooklyn college, it was really fun. 

00:15:40
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:15:40
PRECIOUS Yeah and my best friend also went to Brooklyn college. Umm… she isn't a theater major, she wasn't a theater major. Uh… but we had an apartment together umm… off campus and it was a lot of fun. 

00:15:50
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:15:55
PRECIOUS Umm… she came to see all my shows there uh… really, really nice community. Yeah. 

00:16:00

MARCIA LIU Do you feel like, are you from the area or are you? 

00:16:05
PRECIOUS I'm from Queens. 

00:16:05
MARCIA LIU Oh, yeah. 

00:16:05
PRECIOUS Yeah. 

00:16:10
Learning about family and cultural history 

00:16:10
MARCIA LIU How is it, tell me about, what was it like growing up there? 

00:16:10
PRECIOUS In Queens? 

00:16:10
MARCIA LIU Yeah, sure. 

00:16:15
PRECIOUS Umm… it was definitely fun umm… I group up in Richmond Hill. So I, I really go like west Indian uh… latino community. Umm… and I, I've spent all my life basically like elementary school there, middle school umm… I wasn't born there though. Umm… I was born in the philipians. I came when I was five years old. 

00:16:45
MARCIA LIU Okay. Yeah. And tell me about your family? 

00:16:45
PRECIOUS My family, maybe (inaudible ). 

00:16:48
MARCIA LIU Okay. 

00:16:50
PRECIOUS I'm the eldest of three, My younger brother Joe, the youngest umm… is just starting middle school, just started umm… and he's so driven. 

00:17:05
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:17:05
PRECIOUS So driven. I think, he wants to be a doctor. 

00:17:05
MARCIA LIU Wow. 

00:17:05
PRECIOUS And my parents are very proud of that. 

00:17:10
MARCIA LIU Sure. 

00:17:10
PRECIOUS And my other brother (inaudible) is umm… in high school rightnow and like (inaudible) he wants to go into computers. 

00:17:20
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:17:20
PRECIOUS Yeah. 

00:17:25
Assess for acculturative differences within the family 

00:17:25
MARCIA LIU (inaudible) and Joe both born in the U.S. But immigrated here with your parents? 

00:17:25
PRECIOUS Yes. 

00:17:25
MARCIA LIU So it must have been a specific experience that, I wonder if there are differences between how they, experience the world or how you experience the world being that, you have that experience? 

00:17:40
PRECIOUS Yeah, there is definitely, I mean they are so much younger than me. 

00:17:40
MARCIA LIU Right. 

00:17:40
PRECIOUS It feels like actually. Umm… and it, it's just interesting seeing how my parents raise them and remembering how they raise me. 

00:17:55
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:17:55
PRECIOUS Umm… I think that, I think that there is definitely a, like a generational something there. 

00:18:05
MARCIA LIU There are some differences. 

00:18:05
PRECIOUS There is definitely yes, there are differences umm… I catch my brothers really just snapping at my parents but I don't think that they mean it, mean to be rude or disrespectful. Umm… (inaudible ). 

00:18:22
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:18:25
PRECIOUS And my parents don't really understand that. 

00:18:25
MARCIA LIU Okay. 

00:18:30
PRECIOUS Umm…, I know that if like I ever did that. 

00:18:30
MARCIA LIU Right. 

00:18:30
PRECIOUS I probably wouldn't hear the end of it. 

00:18:30
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:18:35
PRECIOUS Umm… but there is definitely that, that difference. 

00:18:40
MARCIA LIU Yeah. Do you feel, I wonder, do you feel like they, you kind of look at your parents differently or treat them differently than you do. It sounds like you would never sort of be on your found distracted while your parents are talking to you but for them. Yeah, for them, that's okay. 

00:18:55
PRECIOUS Yeah. Umm… and like I said, they don't mean to be rude. 

00:18:55
MARCIA LIU Sure. 

00:19:00
PRECIOUS It's just that was on the phone and (inaudible ) but it's always just interacted on their iPhone. 

00:19:05
MARCIA LIU Yeah. What do you think umm… what do you think that you guys are different in that way? 

00:19:10
PRECIOUS I mean, it's really I think the way that we were brought up. 

00:19:15
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:19:15
PRECIOUS Uh… my parents always raised me to hold a lot of respect for my elders. Umm… look people in the eye, always greet them when you come in and when you leave. Umm… get their blessing kind of thing. Uh… and my brothers, it's just not the culture here. 

00:19:40
MARCIA LIU Sure. 

00:19:40
PRECIOUS Yeah. 

00:19:45
MARCIA LIU And it sounds like you umm…, you noticed that, you noticed that difference when you (inaudible) all together. Do you see them often? No, these days. 

00:19:50
PRECIOUS Well, when I was an undergrad, I lived off campus but now because of (inaudible ) and everything umm… I had to move back home. So I commute from home. Um… It's definitely a change. 

00:20:05
MARCIA LIU That's a lot, yeah. (inaudible ) to be back, back at home. 

00:20:10
PRECIOUS It's a change. Yeah, it's a change. Umm… not that my parents don't give me any space. Uh… they, they definitely give me a lot of space but umm… you know, it's, I sometimes feel guilty uh…, you know, I see them and they're still working umm… but I, I almost feel like I have an obligation to help them out. 

00:20:40
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:20:40
PRECIOUS Umm… even if it's just like cleaning the house more or spending some time with them uh… they're there. 

00:20:50
MARCIA LIU Right, right. 

00:20:55
PRECIOUS Umm… and they've been really understanding to, to a certain extent. Umm… they still don't understand like this schedule that I have umm…. 

00:21:05
MARCIA LIU Right, it sounds like you're not, you're home to sleep. There is not a lot of free time. 

00:21:10
PRECIOUS Yeah exactly umm… and sometimes I don't think they, they could keep up. They, yeah, they don't understand that. It's not a regular nine to five and I'm doing umm… and I'm still in school that I'm juggling. Umm… I think that they were under the assumption that I would have had some kind of job after college umm… that was a nine to five. 

00:21:30
MARCIA LIU Right. 

00:21:35
PRECIOUS Umm… or at least just more consistent schedule umm… 

00:21:40
Reflection of feelings 

00:21:40
MARCIA LIU So it sounds like, I'm hearing you say like you feel this great deal of responsibility to kind of care for them, be there for them, support them, honor them in different ways. 

00:21:45
PRECIOUS Yeah. 

00:21:45
MARCIA LIU At the same time, there is sort of this disconnect in that. You're pursuing something that potentially, they don't have as much familiarity with or at least it wasn't their expectation that you're gonna continue into, into a creative role. Does that feel, is that, is that part of it? 

00:22:05
PRECIOUS Yeah, yeah umm… I don't think they really wanted me to go into theater (inaudible ). I remember when I was, I was a little younger, umm… I, I loved Harry Potter. 

00:22:15
MARCIA LIU Sure. 

00:22:20
PRECIOUS And there is a character in there umm… Cho Cheng (ph.) and I was so excited. I was like, oh an Asian character. Umm… and I remember wanting to like try out and I remember my dad just discouraging me and to saying, you know, they are not looking for that kind of Asian. 

00:22:40
Clarity for meaning behind vague statements re: race/ethinicity 

00:22:40
MARCIA LIU Umm… what do you think was behind that? 

00:22:40
PRECIOUS I mean, I think at the heart of it, he really just wants me to be successful. 

00:22:50
MARCIA LIU Sure. 

00:22:50
PRECIOUS Umm… and to, to do more than just survive umm… and I know that he, he mean, he means well. 

00:23:00
MARCIA LIU Right. 

00:23:00
PRECIOUS And he cares for me. Umm… 

00:23:05
MARCIA LIU I mean, it sounds like, it could be from the way that they were trying to protect you and, and in some ways he's speaking to I wonder umm… the way Asians are depicted in, in the media. There is definitely differences between east Asians and Philipino Americans and how, who do they sort of, who does the media see as being you know, traditionally, they are looking for an Asian person. It definitely is like a lot of privileged and, and some power but now you're disempowered, but different experiences between our communities, I mean, between you and I but it also sounds like at the same time that was kind of disappointing to hear him, you know really discourage you from pursuing something that you were so excited about to. 

00:23:45
Broach differences in race and ethnicity in the room 

00:23:45
PRECIOUS Yeah, and it also made me start wondering at an even younger age like, questioning like why, why am I going out to make theater if I'm not fully accepted? 

00:24:00
Shifting conversation to present day life 

00:24:00
MARCIA LIU For sure, yeah. and so now, you're at NYU. 

00:24:00
PRECIOUS Yes. 

00:24:00
MARCIA LIU You're doing this. Tell me about, what, what does it feel like there as a Philipino American actor? 

00:24:10
PRECIOUS Umm… I, it's, it's a blessing. I mean, I am getting a lot of practice. I'm getting a lot of practice. I'm learning more umm… there is this one class that I'm, I'm struggling with though uh… it's umm…, it's like a dialect course umm… it's just really interesting because most of my class are, they're Anglo European umm… white basically. Umm… and a lot of the dialects that we are learning is like, Irish or umm… certain dialects in British, uh… and it's hard for me. 

00:24:50
MARCIA LIU Yeah. Tell me. 

00:24:55
PRECIOUS It's really hard for me. Umm… because it's like sometime, it sometime it just doesn't feel like I belong there almost. 

00:25:00
MARCIA LIU Got it. 

00:25:05
PRECIOUS Because you know, all these people they're, they know it, it's almost like second nature to them and like, it's so hard for me to keep up sometimes. 

00:25:15
MARCIA LIU Yeah. Can you tell me a little bit like I'm just not familiar in terms of what happens in a dialect class. Can you tell me a little bit what it's like? 

00:25:20
PRECIOUS Umm… well you know, sometimes they give you like a chart like syllables and pronounce it umm… and it depends on like the play. 

00:25:30
MARCIA LIU Sure. 

00:25:30
PRECIOUS Umm… I had, there was this one class umm… we were doing in Shakespeare and they gave us this like the original pronounciation OP. 

00:25:40
MARCIA LIU Got it. 

00:25:40
PRECIOUS Umm… in Shakespeare, umm… and it I just couldn't pronounce it. It just felt like my tongue… 

00:25:50
MARCIA LIU Didn't work that way. 

00:25:50
PRECIOUS Didn't work that way. 

00:25:50
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:25:55
PRECIOUS Umm… the way, it's like, Spanish accents umm… or even like uh…, you know, um, like the Latino uh… accents, I, I maybe but most of the dialect umm… that we're learning at least in this semester, it's like Irish and you go one by one. 

00:26:15
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:26:20
PRECIOUS You just say it or you go, you pick a monologue and you, you say this monologue umm… 

00:26:25
MARCIA LIU In the voice of… 

00:26:25
PRECIOUS Yeah, the dialect umm… and you know, it's like seven, eight other people who are just listening. 

00:26:35
MARCIA LIU Right. 

00:26:35
PRECIOUS And watching you. Umm… and sometimes professor has notes. Umm… most of the time they have notes for me. 

00:26:45
MARCIA LIU Yeah, like feedback afterwards. 

00:26:45
PRECIOUS Feedback, yeah. And uh… sometimes the classmates, my classmates chime in umm… and we just kind of go from there. 

00:27:00
Check in about emotional experiences 

00:27:00
MARCIA LIU Yeah, so everybody saw this done like, you're I'm just picturing you reading this piece, either this monologue or you know particular words. Do you know, how you feel when you're in that room and about to sort of perform in front of your peers? 

00:27:15
PRECIOUS Umm… intimidated. Intimidated uh… just almost like, just like I don't know what I'm doing here. 

00:27:25
MARCIA LIU It doesn't feel like, like you belong? 

00:27:30
PRECIOUS Yeah. 

00:27:35
Analyze contextual differences that contribute to current stress compared to previous contexts 

00:27:35
MARCIA LIU In that moment. Have you felt that way in other spaces, I know, you are Brooklyn college, when you were there? 

00:27:35
PRECIOUS Umm… not so much Brooklyn college. Not so much Brooklyn college, I think maybe one because I had my best friend. Umm… and I guess because there were more people of color. 

00:27:50
MARCIA LIU Yeah, absolutely. 

00:27:55
PRECIOUS In my class in undergrad. 

00:27:55
MARCIA LIU That's what you're saying, the racial dynamics in the room at NYU in this classroom in particular it sounds like, it's pretty, it's pretty uh… there is a strong dynamic of mostly white folks in the room and you being the, are you the only person of color in the room? 

00:28:10
PRECIOUS Uh… there is one more person of color, yeah. 

00:28:10
MARCIA LIU Yeah, sure. Tell me what has it been like, I'm also thinking like with the dialects you're, you're supposed to be of sort of performing in these ethnically Euro, you know dialects, Irish and having a British accent for example, an English accent. What was it like for you? 

00:28:30
PRECIOUS Umm… it feels like, just like fake and at the heart of, you know, acting theater and this craft, it's supposed to be, you know depicting the human being but every time that I just with that particular class, it's, I was fake. 

00:28:55
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:28:55
PRECIOUS The word feels fake as well. 

00:28:55
MARCIA LIU The idea of like putting on this accent as a way of embodying some person. 

00:29:00
PRECIOUS Yeah. 

00:29:05
Assess for personal and cultural history as related to the classroom experience/activities 

00:29:05
MARCIA LIU Do you remember yourself having an accent when you came over from the Phillipian? 

00:29:05
PRECIOUS Sometimes it still comes out. 

00:29:10
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:29:10
PRECIOUS Yeah. 

00:29:10
MARCIA LIU And tell me about what's been like? 

00:29:15
PRECIOUS Umm… having an accent? 

00:29:15
MARCIA LIU Yeah, yes speaking, did you feel pressure to lose it? What's it like, what's it been like for you? 

00:29:20
PRECIOUS Umm… I think when I first came here, I mean, like I said, I was five. 

00:29:20
MARCIA LIU Right. 

00:29:25
PRECIOUS So uh… it was almost, I, I didn't think too much about it. I think it was only maybe around the time I got in undergrad. That's when I started to really uh… realize I guess that I had an accent. Umm… and I did feel pressured to sound a certain way. Umm… you know, as an actor you've got an auditions a lot. Umm… and one, you know, you have to speak with clarity umm… and then see it but I even if I thought I was speaking clearly or enunciating umm… it's, there was always a note that oh, can you, can you speak more clearly? 

00:30:15
MARCIA LIU Got it. 

00:30:15
PRECIOUS And then that's when I started realizing that oh, it does sound a little different than my classmate. 

00:30:25
MARCIA LIU Do you remember how that (inaudible ) for you like what it felt like to get those notes? 

00:30:30
PRECIOUS Umm… and I still get them. Sometimes, umm… it was almost like, they were pointing out something that I didn't realize I had like uh… some kind of a mistake I didn't know, I was making. 

00:30:50
MARCIA LIU Sure. It sounds like there is definitely a sort of this idea, this ideal way of speaking that they were looking for and, and that feedback sounds like it could, it can be really personal to experience you know, like I'm not speaking the most clearly and whatever that means according to the person who is judging you. 

00:31:05
PRECIOUS Yeah. 

00:31:05
MARCIA LIU I'm just thinking, I wonder how sort of odd it must be now that there is, you're sort of being graded on speaking with an accept and it's not, it's a particular type of accent that, that now it sounds like you're supposed to be performing in this particular way in front of all these other folks and how odd that must be given your previous experiences? 

00:31:30
PRECIOUS Yeah. I spend a lot of time practicing. 

00:31:30
MARCIA LIU Yeah, yeah. 

00:31:35
PRECIOUS Yeah umm… and it sometimes feels like uh… I can't keep up. 

00:31:45
Assess for interpersonal experiences of being an imposter 

00:31:45
MARCIA LIU Yeah. Do you feel like in that room umm… people are watching you and judging you and sort of giving you the same kind of judgment that you've received previously? 

00:31:55
PRECIOUS Yeah, it almost goes back to umm…, to that moment with my dad almost that it, it, it feels like almost I guess alienating. 

00:32:10
MARCIA LIU Yeah, like you're kind of the only one in that room and people are looking at you and thinking maybe you're not, you don't have the job or something like that. 

00:32:20
PRECIOUS Yeah. 

00:32:20
MARCIA LIU It reminds me of this topic. There is this, this experience a lot of times, folks have called it experience when they, one of very people like in their program or in their work or whatever. Umm… and it's just like feeling of, feeling like an imposter like they don't actually belong there and they got in by some error for example like you know, they accidentally got into this program or into this job or something and it's really haunting where it can make them question and doubt all of their you know, talents and strengths and intelligence and all these gifts. I, I was just thinking it kind of feels like what you're talking about kind of reminds me of that experience and I wonder if that resonates at all for you? 

00:33:05
PRECIOUS Yeah, well what you've said umm… at the beginning, it feels, it feels like they were, they only wanted me in NYU because they were filling some kind of quota umm… sometimes I do feel like that. 

00:33:25
MARCIA LIU Yeah, yeah. And how does that feel for you? 

00:33:25
PRECIOUS Well, I would, I would like to think that I got in by my talent and I've worked hard uh… so it is disappointing and if they were just filling up a quota umm… but it really does feel like that sometimes. 

00:33:45
MARCIA LIU Yeah. I wonder, how did you feel when you were acting at Brooklyn college? What was it like there? We know that the racial dynamics are very different. You had friends there. I wonder how it felt for you. 

00:33:55
PRECIOUS I felt like an artist. 

00:33:55
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:34:00
PRECIOUS I felt like I could focus more on my craft umm… and I didn't have as many doubts as I do now. 

00:34:10
MARCIA LIU Right. 

00:34:10
PRECIOUS Uh… I guess we did have dialect classes and I did start hearing differences in my voice and stuff but they just felt more accepting. 

00:34:20
MARCIA LIU Yeah. And it sounds like you didn't sort of second guess. I'm only here because I'm filling a quota or I don't actually belong here. It sounds like you're able to really thrive and experience the joy of being in your craft. 

00:34:35
PRECIOUS Yeah. 

00:34:35
MARCIA LIU Being in something that feels so naturally good. 

00:34:40
PRECIOUS Yeah, yeah and then it felt like a lot of umm… my classmates were supportive umm… and I don't feel that way. 

00:34:45
MARCIA LIU Sure. 

00:34:45
PRECIOUS Now. 

00:34:45
MARCIA LIU Yeah. Do you umm… does it feel like a relatively new thing for you to doubt yourself on this level about your talents, about your capabilities? 

00:34:55
PRECIOUS Umm… I mean, I feel like I've always had some kind of doubt before umm… but I think now it's this, it's just intensified. 

00:35:05
MARCIA LIU Sure, sure. 

00:35:05
PRECIOUS Yeah. 

00:35:10
Investigate client's thoughts and emotions in the classroom 

00:35:10
MARCIA LIU Sorry umm… I wonder if also as you're sitting there feeling this feeling in that room, if you feel umm… nervous that you're gonna somehow out yourself as not belonging there somehow like if, it sounds like there is so much pressure to perform umm… perfectly and I'm wondering, I wonder if that, if that is your experience? 

00:35:35
PRECIOUS That I'm, I'm gonna out myself? 

00:35:35
MARCIA LIU Yeah, like umm… that people will discover that you actually do struggle, you do maybe that you're an imposter and that you don't actually belong there. I'm not saying this because it's actually true. I'm just thinking, I wonder what your experience, if, if these doubts kind of haunt you and you start to think like I need to, it sounds like there is so much pressure to perform well in there. Does that make sense? 

00:36:00
PRECIOUS Yeah. There is definitely a pressure to perform well. I feel like in a way I'm to represent my community. 

00:36:10
MARCIA LIU Yeah. Can you say more about that? 

00:36:10
PRECIOUS Umm… because I am one of the few people of color there, umm… it feels like I have to be twice as good. 

00:36:20
MARCIA LIU Right, absolutely. 

00:36:20
PRECIOUS As everyone else. 

00:36:20
MARCIA LIU Or else, what would happen? 

00:36:25
PRECIOUS Or else, I'll be seen as a failure. 

00:36:25
MARCIA LIU People will judge. 

00:36:30
PRECIOUS Yeah. 

00:36:35
MARCIA LIU And they will judge your community. 

00:36:40
PRECIOUS They'll judge my community or people from my community will judge me. 

00:36:45
MARCIA LIU Right. Sure. You had said, umm… that your parents would think you were going to some kind of job like a nine to five job afterwards. 

00:36:50
Explore parental expectations and parents educational backgrounds 

00:36:50
PRECIOUS Yeah. 

00:36:50
MARCIA LIU Have they gone, have they had their own graduate at school experience or what's their own educational history? 

00:36:55
PRECIOUS Umm…, well my dad is a registered nurse umm… and my mom works at a department store. 

00:37:00
MARCIA LIU Yeah, sure. 

00:37:00
PRECIOUS Both of them really want me to go into the medical field. 

00:37:05
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:37:05
PRECIOUS They want me to be a nurse. 

00:37:10
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:37:10
PRECIOUS And actually my mom, yeah, she's very traditional, so she's like, you now, I, I pray for you to change your field every time kind of deal. 

00:37:20
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:37:20
PRECIOUS And that doesn't make me feel so great. 

00:37:25
MARCIA LIU Yeah, I can imagine. It sounds like there is pressure from them as well. 

00:37:30
PRECIOUS Yeah. Yeah. And like I said they, they give me space umm… but they just don't understand my lifestyle um, and I'm sure that they want me to succeed. 

00:37:40
MARCIA LIU Sure. 

00:37:45
PRECIOUS Umm… but they would rather me have stability. 

00:37:50
MARCIA LIU Right, right. It sounds like that's what they really value and at the same time it sounds like this isn't, you know, this is, this is what you're sorry what you're talking about now in terms of acting is really something that you've experienced so much joy and strength and… 

00:38:05
PRECIOUS Yeah. 

00:38:05
MARCIA LIU It's your gift. 

00:38:05
PRECIOUS Yeah. 

00:38:10
Explore how familial expectations contribute to pressure to perform 

00:38:10
MARCIA LIU And I wonder if it that, that knowing the pressure from them, knowing that they want you to do something different, knowing that maybe they don't really totally understand what it is that you're doing. If that also contributes to your feeling like you do have to perform really, really well while you're there because you're kind of going in this other direction that they don't totally understand? 

00:38:30
PRECIOUS And I kind of want to prove to them that umm… hey, you know, you can make a living out of this umm… They are very proud of my brothers umm… like I said they, they are very, very scientific and mathematical and I chose a life in the arts. 

00:38:50
MARCIA LIU Right. I think it's amazing first of all that you're doing this. It does feel like it's you're the first of hopefully many more who are going into this field and it's hard when there is not somebody who has carved up that path before you. That you know, you can recognize and say well my mom did it or my dad did it or I know such and such, you know, these people in the community who did it and therefore like I know I'm gonna be okay and it's really hard to be the first person, at least in your own circle. We feel like I have, this stream is worth it to follow, to follow through one especially in the face of other pressure you're receiving both from your parents, your family as well as like just the environment and why it doesn't sound like it's so welcoming, like they are not really hearing and seeing your experience in all of its richness. It sounds like it's really much more focused on other folk's experience, specific the white folk's experience and history. 

00:39:50
PRECIOUS Umm… but it's very good for like my craft, that's how I feel in terms of. 

00:39:50
MARCIA LIU Sure, sure. 

00:39:55
PRECIOUS And I know that it's so prestigious. 

00:39:55
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:39:55
PRECIOUS And I know that a lot of people when they see NYU in your resume, it's like, wow. 

00:40:00
MARCIA LIU It's a big deal. 

00:40:00
PRECIOUS It's a big deal. 

00:40:05
MARCIA LIU You ought to be proud of. 

00:40:05
PRECIOUS But it's like, it feels like well… 

00:40:10
MARCIA LIU Yeah. 

00:40:10
PRECIOUS It's taking a lot. 

00:40:10
MARCIA LIU Absolutely. 

00:40:10
PRECIOUS To get there. 

00:40:15
MARCIA LIU Yeah, well so that we talked about this, I feel like you came in starting with you know, the feeling of being off and something being off center and it sounds like there is a lot of stress that you're going through and things are incredibly busy right now in this time in your life. And if you want, we can continue talking about this in, you know, different sessions in the future, if that sounds like you'd be okay with you? 

00:40:35
PRECIOUS Yeah. I like that, actually. 

00:40:35
MARCIA LIU Great, cool. Let's do that. And I'll see you next week. 

00:40:40
PRECIOUS Thank you. 

00:40:40
MARCIA LIU Sure. 

00:40:45
Debriefing with 

00:40:45
Therapist and Client 

00:40:45
KEVIN Hi name is Dr. Kevin (inaudible ). I'm an associate professor of psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Today we are going to debrief what we just saw, this lovely session and so first I want to thank you all for participating uh, in the session and demonstrating uh… great example of uh… how to deal with imposter phenomenon. So precious what was that like for you as a client umm… just experiencing the session with Dr. Liu. 

00:41:10
MARCIA LIU It was definitely eye opening. Umm…, I think that you put terms to feelings that I felt but just I haven't found the words for it. 

00:41:20
KEVIN What was it like hearing about specific term imposter? 

00:41:25
PRECIOUS Imposter, it's, it's really strong. 

00:41:30
MARCIA LIU Yeah, sure. 

00:41:30
PRECIOUS Umm… and but it really made me think like yeah, actually these are the spaces when I did feel that way, yeah. 

00:41:40
MARCIA LIU I feel like, it can be, it can kind of take people umm…, (inaudible ) surprised like how strong the term is like oh, do I really think that way like it's so, so heavy. 

00:41:50
KEVIN And at the same time, I think that's why we, we label it imposter because it's, it's supposed to be so outlandish that why would you feel like an imposter when reality is like you deserve your place at the table or whatever position that you're in. 

00:42:05
MARCIA LIU Yeah, it's like, I always pictured imposter like somebody who snuck in to the room and they're like I'm here when I actually clearly don't belong and sometimes that is the psychological experience of like, I don't belong here. 

00:42:15
KEVIN I mean, one thing that I really like was that you were able to demonstrate how to bring in umm… things that psychologists and other folks research umm… into an actual therapy session and, and how to model umm… just bringing it in so smoothly. Uh…, so you know, for the past 20 years or so, there have been folks who have been studying imposter phenomenon and specifically internalized depression. So this notion that uh… people of various marginalized groups learn that their group is bad or not as smart or not uh… as attractive or whatever it might be umm… and this is something that affects people's everyday's lives and that may come into at therapy sessions. And so you know, I wonder umm… what it was like for Dr. Liu to, to use that word and what did that feel like for you precious? 

00:43:05
PRECIOUS Umm… the imposter? 

00:43:05
KEVIN Yeah. 

00:43:05
PRECIOUS Uh… like I said, it, it feels like you were bringing terms that I've felt but haven't been able to articulate. Umm…, I think it was really also helpful that you also are a person of color umm… and that I was able to, I guess open up to you more. 

00:43:25
MARCIA LIU Yeah, sure. I'm glad that it felt safe. I wonder how it would have felt if there wasn't a person of color and how well it would be helpful for you, umm… given you know, what your experience has been. 

00:43:35
PRECIOUS Yeah, I don't think, I would have been as open. Um, I think, I definitely would have been on guard or felt this need to perform again. 

00:43:45
MARCIA LIU It's good to know. 

00:43:45
KEVIN Yeah, I think one thing I saw just from observing the interaction was that, you know you demonstrate a lot of cultural competence and as, as every time you demonstrated something for example, umm… being aware of the Asian American diaspora and some of the, the issues really, that she opened a little bit more and then you talked about like sometimes people of color internalized these things and then she opens up even more. So I think, it's, it's great that you know, you were as a person of color able to, in yourself be able to make her feel safe. But then you also demonstrated these, these additional pieces that, that led to that. 

00:44:20
MARCIA LIU Yeah, I feel like umm… the way that we have been trained, you know, we've learned all these knowledge is so important but sometimes even myself like and it's like a therapy session it can feel like sort of awkard to introduce these concepts and not be like I'm teaching the client, you know, and because it's really about your own experience more so than it's like these three steps are exactly what you need to, blah-blah-blah and at the same time these are really uh… painful and umm… it's really experiences, you know, internalize racism, internalize a person like in so many different ways is such an important thing for us to, to talk about openly in the room. 

00:45:00
KEVIN Yeah, one thing that I like that you did too was that you didn't definitely say you have this imposter phenomenon but rather you asked as a possibility, is that I wonder if this is something that you feel umm… which she replied with yes and that led to further exploration. So I think it's also really important umm… to test the waters and sometimes your hypothesis might be correct and sometimes they might not be as correct and that's still very helpful uh, information to have. 

00:45:25
MARCIA LIU Yeah, sure. 

00:45:25
KEVIN Yeah. Were there things in the session that you wish she may would have done differently? 

00:45:30
MARCIA LIU Yeah, you know, like I brought, I kind of barreled through this like umm… the point where I, I mentioned, where you were talking about your father and role in Harry Potter and how he said umm… correct me if I'm wrong like they are not looking for your type of, Asian like you and I really wanted to bring up you know, I'm east Asian, I'm Chinese American and you're Filipino American. What is it like to sit with somebody who is not Filipino American? Who is Asian and maybe is that type of Asian that your dad was referencing but umm… the differences between us what did it feel like and I probably would have processed that a little bit more differently umm… because that's an important, you know, like it's important to be honest about that and it's like understands that we can always talk about our differences as well. 

00:46:15
KEVIN One thing that I noticed in umm… just in the interaction was you made like a split second decision of like do I process the relationship or do I not? Because, because you mentioned that or even with us then you, you paused. Umm… but I, I don't think that uh… it was wrong to, to not have brought it up now. You can always just keep that in the back of your mind and then in a future session, you can reintroduce the concept. 

00:46:35
MARCIA LIU Absolutely. 

00:46:40
KEVIN Yeah. And I'm a big believer in, in anytime that you think, you could have done something differently but there are opportunities to, to do things again. 

00:46:45
MARCIA LIU Yeah, it's a nice seed and like knowing that we can kind of go on that as our relationship continues and that also might have been, I'm thinking, I wonder even unconsciously, it was like, are we gonna, should we go into this now, should we do this later, what's our, we've just met, what's our alliance like so far and try to figure out that timing is something that, it's tricky but yeah, it's a good point. 

00:47:05
KEVIN Yeah. I mean, I think one thing that's important is uh, for, for people to know that it's important that it's necessary to talk about racial issues, cultural issues and to bring them into the first session and I think of the way, the way you did it was uh… it seems so natural. I think a lot of times people are afraid to, to bring up race or culture as if it's like a taboo of some sort. Umm… and so precious to your point, you said, you felt immediately comfortable because she's a person of color. Umm… but if she was a white person, would there be ways that she could demonstrate competence, umm…, you know I know that there is a lot of research that finds that people of color are most likely to or more likely to drop out of counseling after the first session. Umm…, if they even see counseling or therapy at all and so umm… and then there is also there a research that shows that uh… clients who, who say that their clients of color who say that their therapist talk about race, I feel more of an alliance, um… especially if it's talked about early. Umm… so I just think that's something like just really uh… important for people to recognize. Yeah. Any thoughts about that concept precious like you know, what would if she was white, what would you have liked or would that be helpful, you'll feel safer? 

00:48:20
PRECIOUS I definitely would have appreciated umm…, sense, sensitivity umm… and compassion umm… and I uh… not invalidating my experience yeah. 

00:48:35
KEVIN Right. And we know that it have so many umm… either clients or, or former clients umm… who, who've when I walked into the room, they would say, oh thank God or something like that and I feel lucky in that way. I also feel pressure in that way because now you have sort of all these different people. 

00:48:55
MARCIA LIU And we all like umm… sometimes I think like there might be like umm… an expectation that you know my story because you are a person of color so I do think depending on the level of racial awareness and racial identity development of the person, they might know a lot about your story but there can be so many different other sort of intersecting parts and the expectations, it's interesting, you know, what the expectations of this therapist might be just based on, you know, how you perceive them on the outside. It kind of depends on the person and the (inaudible ) of that. 

00:49:30
KEVIN Yeah, another part that I wanted just to bring up is this uh… the fact that you were able to get emotional if I was umm… was one really like brave and you know, just felt really raw umm… and then I as an observer watching it started to feel emotional as well and so I was wondering if you might be able to speak to your counter transference and how you may have been able to manage any emotions you were having in reaction to precious's story? 

00:49:55
MARCIA LIU Sure, I mean, I think umm… there is a part of me that like yes, absolutely, we've felt this deep emotion that was definitely present and wanting this feel, having this feeling of like I wanted to protect you and I didn't want you to feel like umm… this space wasn't safe and that you know, we were together, we were gonna move through this and that we don't have to resolve it all in one day. Umm…, so it was just gonna take some time. Umm… and to, to ride by you, you know, to really honor the work because I feel like you're bringing in something that's so intimate and vulnerable and especially in our communities, oftentimes this is so, such a no-no to spread you know like what you're struggling with, with a total stranger in a different room and just wanting to, to be protective and honoring of that experience was something that was really important to me. 

00:50:40
KEVIN Yeah. Umm…, I, I just think it, it's really uh… a specific skill to be able to manage that emotion umm… and especially uh… when you do want to protect your clients umm… but you know, also demonstrating that we aren't gonna solve all problems in this 30 minute session and you know, and then that we shouldn't get into problem solving mode. Sometimes it's okay to just allow your clients to sit with their emotion and, you know, just, just be in the, in the moment. 

00:51:10
MARCIA LIU Yeah, sure. 

00:51:15
KEVIN Yeah. So any, any other thoughts of ways of what you would want to do uh… in the future with the client? 

00:51:20
MARCIA LIU Yeah, I think I would see as kind of going towards umm… understanding, you know where the (inaudible ) comes from, recognizing all the ways that maybe you've been told that you're acting as long as good or somehow less worthy. Uh, we started sort of talking about this in terms of having to lose your own accent as a way of being seen as legitimate, as an actor and umm… and then from there like really talking about all of her strengths, all of her talents, all of the ways that she's made it this far and those being legitimate. Umm… and kind of grounding, you know that sense of confidence and assertness in yourself. Because it won't be the last time that this is especially as like a AAPI actress, an actor like they are gonna be so many more ways bases to navigate and knowing like to recognize, oh I feel like an imposter, again I know what this is about, let's like go back and think about all the ways that I belong here too despite maybe what the feedback that I'm getting umm… is trying to tell me. 

00:52:20
KEVIN Okay. So thank you so much for being here and uh… thank you for sharing your story.
