Erving Polster, PhD 

00:00:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Hello. If you don't respond, I'll start singing. And then you'll be sorry. 

00:01:10
[sil] 

00:01:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, I, um -- when I -- when I -- got the brochure with the program, which came long after we made arrangements for what we're going to do at the conference, and I saw the title "On the Road Again", I thought "What? What could I have had in my mind?" And I do love Willie Nelson, and I thought that there's something about the dealing with psychotherapeutic sequences. 

00:01:45
UNKNOWN No. 

00:01:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER What? 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN No. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN Can't hear. 

00:01:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Cannot hear? 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN No. 

00:01:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Audio guy? I don't understand. I can hear very well. Well, where is the audio person? 

00:02:05
UNKNOWN We can hear on this side. 

00:02:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay, is it -- is it working now? Yes? Yes? Okay. So, anyway, "On the Road Again" sort of implies a trip and I've already talked about tight therapeutic sequences and how that creates a sense of continuity and if you're very careful and tuned in proportionally to what the person can do, it really evolves into a feeling of yes, because they can do each thing sequentially, which, uh, only in the accumulation of sequences does it turn out to go somewhere where previously they might not have gone right away. That's fairly clear logistics.But anyway, so that's what I want to show, but I also want to show how relationship enters in to the therapy and how important it is for a sense of, I don't know what to call it, communion, bonding, joining together, having a mutual stake, enters into the therapeutic experience. And I also want to see how much we can bring in story line and also a sense of different aspects of the person's self, which then become integrated. That's a very big mouthful, and I assure you it's not all going to be very clear during a session, because there's no way to know what aspect of a principle of therapy is going to be manifested in any particular session or part of a session. But still I want to be able to work with somebody here in such a way that we can have some time for you to ask questions about how the session itself reflected therapeutic principles, particularly the ones I've just mentioned, but it could be any others which you become interested in. But, uh, I have no, um, uh, delusions about, uh, what one short therapy session means in terms of the range of a person's lifetime, but I think we can get some illustration from which you can make your own extrapolations about how it might affect the work that you do as therapists. Um, I do want to say that one of the things that influences me is, um, how to portray people rather than changing them. Now, we in psychotherapy have made century-old life's work of how to portray people, how -- how to focus on how they live their lives and what their lives are about. We generally put that in the background because we're much more interested in either cure or growth. Well, I'm interested in cure and growth also, but I hope to be able to navigate the paradox between the fact that I'm not focused on change when I'm working with a particular person, I'm interested in engagement, portrayal, focus, understanding, things like that, with the background feeling that we gotta go somewhere where they wanted to go. So, with that in mind, someone -- some woman came up and wanted to work with me; she wanted before the session, when we were standing out there. And I told her that I didn't want to set it up in advance, but it may be that that would be a good way out if there are many people who want to work. We don't want to spend a lot of time deciding who's -- who's it gonna be. So I don't know, is it okay with you if she comes up? 

00:06:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:06:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay, you'll have to get a release. 

00:06:15
UNKNOWN Are you referring to when we talked? 

00:06:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER What? 

00:06:20
UNKNOWN Are you referring to when we talked? Or somebody else? 

00:06:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER I didn't hear that. 

00:06:25
UNKNOWN The volunteer has to sign. The volunteer. 

00:06:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER  The volunteer. Pardon me? Are you asking whether she's a volunteer? Yes. 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:06:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Is that the question? Yes, I don't know her -- 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN Oh. 

00:06:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- at all. I can't say I don't know her at all. I know that she came up to me and asked to -- to work. Now, that -- that's not a small item. So where's the person who does the release? You guys are in a position where you don't have to deal with lights in front of you. 

00:07:05
[sil.] 

00:07:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Well, there ought to be something I could say that, um, fills the dead air time. I hate to fill in, but -- anyway, I do think, uh -- I had a very interesting experience early this afternoon when I went to Marcia Linehan's lecture, and she was saying things that were -- had such different language from mine, but they were the -- they're very much the same. And I'm really touched by how many of us here have very common ground in terms of how we see people and how we see the role of therapy in people's lives, and I like that quality of -- usually we find differences more interesting than similarities, and it's a very driving force in our frames of mind. 

00:08:10
MICHELLE All righty! 

00:08:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- to focus on difference -- hi. 

00:08:10
MICHELLE  Hi. 

00:08:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay, that's enough of that. Now, I don't know whether you have to sit exactly in that position. Where's the TV guy, the -- is he -- are these chairs fixed into position for some recording purpose? 

00:08:30
UNKNOWN Do you want to change it? 

00:08:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Well, we're not exactly face to face, but we can do it. What is your name? 

00:08:40
MICHELLE My name's Michelle. 

00:08:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Michelle. 

00:08:40
MICHELLE Um-hum. 

00:08:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Uh-huh. That's a big name nowadays. 

00:08:45
MICHELLE It was in '69 also. 

00:08:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER What? 

00:08:50
MICHELLE It was in 1969 also. Beatles. 

00:08:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, that's the year. 

00:08:50
MICHELLE Yeah. Beatles. 

00:08:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Okay. Let me count. 

00:08:55
MICHELLE I'm 40. 

00:09:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER 40. 

00:09:00
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:09:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, um, I'm more than twice as old, by quite a bit. 

00:09:05
MICHELLE And still fabulous. 

00:09:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Thank you very much. 

00:09:15
[sil.] 

00:09:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER That takes care of my therapy. Now, let's see for yours. So what would you like to do here? What would you like to get to? What would you like to deal with? 

00:09:30
MICHELLE Okay, well, I've been having these feelings lately of feeling like I'm not going to be able to love somebody. 

00:09:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh. 

00:09:40
MICHELLE Um -- 

00:09:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER You -- you're talking about some particular person, or people generally? 

00:09:45
MICHELLE Just somebody and just anybody in general. 

00:09:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:09:50
MICHELLE Um, not my kids. My kids I can love, and that's okay. 

00:09:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh -- 

00:09:55
MICHELLE But -- 

00:09:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- that counts? 

00:09:55
MICHELLE That counts, yes. 

00:09:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, yeah, now, wait. 

00:09:55
MICHELLE It does count. 

00:09:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Just wait a minute. 

00:10:00
MICHELLE But I'm talking a romantic kind of love for somebody. 

00:10:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER What? 

00:10:00
MICHELLE I'm talking a romantic kind of love for somebody. 

00:10:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, I understand. I'm -- I'm not going to discount that you want a romantic kind of love, but I also don't want you to set aside your love for your children as though it's irrelevant -- 

00:10:15
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:10:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- because, my goodness, that's fundamental. 

00:10:15
MICHELLE Yes. 

00:10:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:10:15
MICHELLE Yes. 

00:10:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay. 

00:10:15
MICHELLE  That's a big thing. 

00:10:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Beautiful. Yeah. 

00:10:20
MICHELLE Than you. 

00:10:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay. So tell me, you said you discovered this recently, and how did you do that? 

00:10:25
MICHELLE Well, um, I was married for 13 years and, um, a couple years ago I came out of the closet. Um, I wouldn't say -- 

00:10:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER You came what? 

00:10:35
MICHELLE I came out of the closet. 

00:10:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:10:40
MICHELLE So I wouldn't suggest that if you're married in a hetero marriage, because it doesn't exactly fit that marriage together. So, um -- 

00:10:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Wait, now, you said that very fast. Try it again, because I'd like to understand what you said. 

00:10:50
MICHELLE Um, I came out as gay. Um, I was married in a hetero relationship. 

00:11:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:11:00
MICHELLE And it doesn't -- doesn't do much for the marriage. So, um, we're now separated, yeah. 

00:11:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, that's true -- probably true. 

00:11:05
MICHELLE Yeah. Exactly. So -- 

00:11:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:11:10
MICHELLE Um -- 

00:11:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Are you -- do you have a touch of embarrassment talking about loving and such? I sense a kind of embarrassment in your expression, like, I don't know whether you really should be talking about love or -- 

00:11:25
MICHELLE Um -- 

00:11:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- whether it's okay or -- 

00:11:25
MICHELLE  Some -- sometimes love always feels off-limits to me. 

00:11:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Off-limits? 

00:11:30
MICHELLE Um-hum. 

00:11:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. And what happens with your mouth when you say that? 

00:11:35
MICHELLE I get tight. 

00:11:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER You suddenly look very determined. 

00:11:40
MICHELLE It -- it's tight. Yes. 

00:11:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Tight? 

00:11:40
MICHELLE It's very tight. 

00:11:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Well, maybe you'd like to describe something about being off-limits, because, you know, that could mean a lot of things. 

00:11:50
MICHELLE Um -- 

00:11:55
[sil.] 

00:12:00
MICHELLE There's something kind of fearful in love. 

00:12:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah -- 

00:12:05
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:12:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- something. 

00:12:05
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:12:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Something. Now why do you say "something"? It's almost like you're resigned to not knowing and you're going to take some word like that as -- as an overall word that won't really tell us -- what do you mean something is fearful about loving? 

00:12:20
MICHELLE Um -- 

00:12:30
[sil.] 

00:12:30
MICHELLE  It might be getting caught up in, um, having to be there for somebody. 

00:12:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, now, maybe you'll spell that out for me, too, what -- what being -- 

00:12:45
MICHELLE Um -- 

00:12:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- being there for somebody means to you. 

00:12:55
MICHELLE Probably having to, um, really take care of somebody. And sometimes I just want to be selfish. 

00:13:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, welcome to the crowd. 

00:13:10
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:13:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, I'd like to know about your selfishness. 

00:13:15
MICHELLE  Um, well, lately it's been kind of nice because I have had my, um -- my 50% with the kids and 50% they've been with Dad. And I've had my alone time and I've enjoyed it. 

00:13:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah? 

00:13:40
MICHELLE And -- 

00:13:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER So you didn't feel selfish, is that what you're saying? 

00:13:45
MICHELLE At first I felt kind of like maybe I shouldn't be enjoying this. But -- 

00:13:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh. Ah. 

00:13:50
MICHELLE -- I -- I've learned to enjoy it. 

00:13:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER You've learned to enjoy it? 

00:13:50
MICHELLE Yes. 

00:13:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, can we celebrate? 

00:13:55
MICHELLE Yay! 

00:14:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, that's really -- that -- your laughter is very contagious! I don't know why I'm not laughing if it's contagious. Where do you feel the laughter? 

00:14:15
MICHELLE My laughter is right up here. I don't get a belly laugh too often. 

00:14:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, that felt very deep, that laughter. 

00:14:20
MICHELLE Really? 

00:14:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. It seemed so -- maybe you didn't feel it that way. 

00:14:25
MICHELLE It was -- yeah, I -- 

00:14:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER You felt it up there? 

00:14:25
MICHELLE I keep it very constrained still. 

00:14:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. You're aware of that. 

00:14:30
MICHELLE Um-hum. 

00:14:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER That's quite a -- not an easy awareness to have, and you have it. 

00:14:35
MICHELLE I'm on guard a lot. 

00:14:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER You're on guard a lot? 

00:14:40
MICHELLE Um-hum. 

00:14:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Are you on guard now? 

00:14:40
MICHELLE Of course I am. 

00:14:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Of course you are! 

00:14:45
MICHELLE I'm protecting myself, can't you tell? Okay, let's loosen up. You're going to do a little dance? 

00:14:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Sure. You want to? 

00:14:55
MICHELLE Tonight we can go to the dance and do the rumba or something. 

00:14:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER What's that? 

00:15:00
MICHELLE We can go to the dance tonight and do the rumba or something. 

00:15:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay. 

00:15:00
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:15:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER All right. I -- I don't know whether I could handle the rumba. No, but there's something so different about your laughter as compared with your visage earlier where you looked like, um, you were in danger in some way, and now it's like the world is yours. 

00:15:30
MICHELLE Hmm -- 

00:15:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER For a moment. 

00:15:35
MICHELLE Well, there's times when I think that I want to have a girlfriend, but then there's times when, like, uh, nah. 

00:15:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:15:45
MICHELLE I think I just want those physical needs met. 

00:15:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, I'd like to hear more about it. Is there some way you can elaborate that? 

00:15:50
MICHELLE Sex. 

00:15:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Sex. 

00:15:55
MICHELLE Yeah. Plain and simple. 

00:15:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER So that sometimes you want sex and sometimes you don't? Or -- is that what you're saying? 

00:16:00
MICHELLE Yeah -- well, yeah. I mean, I don't -- I don't necessarily want to get tied down with a girlfriend, I guess. I don't know. 

00:16:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:16:05
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:16:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Uh-huh. 

00:16:05
MICHELLE I don't want to have to give and give and give. 

00:16:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. So do I take it, then, that you'd be more happy to have sex if you didn't feel the risk of being tied down? Is that the implication of what you said? 

00:16:20
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:16:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Uh-huh. 

00:16:25
MICHELLE I mean, it's -- I came out two years ago and I -- I still haven't. 

00:16:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER You still haven't? 

00:16:30
MICHELLE No. 

00:16:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Have not? 

00:16:30
MICHELLE No. 

00:16:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Ooh! 

00:16:35
MICHELLE I gotta get me some! 

00:16:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER What? You need -- 

00:16:40
MICHELLE I gotta get me some, I said. 

00:16:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, you need an agent, or -- 

00:16:45
MICHELLE  I haven't really put myself out there, you know? I've been hiding away. 

00:16:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, it sounds so serious. 

00:17:00
MICHELLE Um, yeah. 

00:17:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER I mean, your laughter is hilarious. 

00:17:00
MICHELLE Yeah, but it covers up a lot of stuff. 

00:17:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER And your concern with sex is -- covers up, it reveals, it does not -- 

00:17:10
MICHELLE Yeah, and -- yeah. 

00:17:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:17:10
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:17:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER What do you think it covers up? 

00:17:15
MICHELLE Um, I gotta make a joke about it so I can just -- 

00:17:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER You're not just making a -- you're just -- you had a moment of hilarity. 

00:17:25
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:17:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Let's -- let's not think of everything as a defense against something else. 

00:17:25
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:17:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Some things -- some things are just what they are. 

00:17:30
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:17:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER And that was hilarious laughter. 

00:17:35
MICHELLE Yeah, I -- 

00:17:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER And I know the difference. 

00:17:35
MICHELLE Seriously -- okay. 

00:17:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay, there you are again. 

00:17:40
MICHELLE I mean, really, I'm gay, I haven't had sex for two years, and the last time I had sex was with my husband. The -- I did have a moment with a woman, but that was when I was 19. 

00:17:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER You had a moment what? 

00:17:55
MICHELLE With a woman, at 19. 

00:17:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, well, and how did -- 

00:17:55
MICHELLE It's been a long time. 

00:17:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Well, what happened in that interim, in terms of your decision? How did you arrive at your decision to -- to become gay and -- 

00:18:05
MICHELLE I always was. 

00:18:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, no, I mean -- I'm not -- I'm not -- 

00:18:10
MICHELLE To come out? 

00:18:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER I'm not speaking theoretically now. 

00:18:10
MICHELLE Yeah, I know. To come out -- to come out, um -- 

00:18:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER This is not theory. I mean, you were 19 and then you were 40 or 39, or whenever it was, 38. 

00:18:20
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:18:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Now, there's a gap -- 

00:18:20
MICHELLE I came out -- 

00:18:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- in there. 

00:18:25
MICHELLE I came out -- I got married because I couldn't actually admit to myself that I was gay, number one. 

00:18:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:18:30
MICHELLE  And I thought I have to get married, I have to have children, this is what I'm supposed to do, yada yada yada. And, um, so then I got to the point of being so depressed all the time. 

00:18:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Yeah. And are you still? 

00:18:55
MICHELLE Not generally. 

00:18:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Not generally? 

00:18:55
MICHELLE Once in a while. 

00:19:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Once -- 

00:19:00
MICHELLE I'm getting down a little bit once in a while. 

00:19:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Ah. 

00:19:00
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:19:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Good for you. Yeah, good for you. 

00:19:05
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:19:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER So I'm -- I'm -- I'm trying to go back to where we started and what you said you wanted. And I don't think you really said what you wanted. You said what was happening. And now I take some implication that you would like to be able to grow into some sexual pleasure or, at least, not having to worry about sex and have some pleasure. Like, you could be -- you can enjoy relationships without sex, or you could have sex without being committed into the relationship. 

00:19:35
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:19:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER I hope you -- 

00:19:40
MICHELLE Um -- 

00:19:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- take that as a didactic experience. 

00:19:45
MICHELLE  Um, but part of me also is, um, struggling with, um, how I want to see myself too. 

00:20:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. But in saying that, you were on the verge of crying, and it's very moving to me, as I think it would be to most anybody sitting here. If others were here, they would be moved by this struggle within where you seem to want to cry, but don't want to let go and do it. But you're doing it, in a way. I mean, I'm recognizing your cry. Now, how is it for you that I mention that? 

00:20:30
MICHELLE Mmm, um, lump in my throat and I -- I -- -- I tend to avoid the feelings as much as I can. 

00:20:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:20:45
MICHELLE I like to focus on the Cog-B, you know, and just -- 

00:20:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER The what? 

00:20:50
MICHELLE Cognitive behavioral, and just stick with that. 

00:20:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, you don't think cognitive behavioral has feeling? 

00:20:55
MICHELLE No. I know it does. It does. 

00:21:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Then you don't some of the cognitive behavioral people I know. 

00:21:00
MICHELLE Yeah, but it doesn't have as much sometimes. 

00:21:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Uh-huh. 

00:21:05
MICHELLE Yeah. But, um -- 

00:21:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER How in the world would you dare to wind up with a gestalt therapist -- 

00:21:15
MICHELLE  Because that's what I needed -- 

00:21:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- in front of -- in front of all these people? 

00:21:20
MICHELLE -- I guess. 

00:21:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER What? 

00:21:20
MICHELLE I -- I guess I go to things that, um, I push myself sometimes. 

00:21:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:21:25
MICHELLE I need to push myself sometimes. 

00:21:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. I think that's a worthwhile thing to do, you know -- 

00:21:35
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:21:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- if you know what you want and you're not pushing yourself for things that somebody else says you should do. 

00:21:40
MICHELLE Yeah. No. 

00:21:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Well, good for you. Okay. 

00:21:45
MICHELLE And, um -- 

00:21:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER But, still, I do want to know more about the cry in you. Is -- is there -- is that something you want to talk about? You don't have to, but it does interest me and you have to know that. But you have to know also that I'm not asking you that you -- 

00:22:00
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:22:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- I'm not requiring it. 

00:22:00
MICHELLE Um, it came up when I was thinking about how very sad I was in my marriage. 

00:22:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:22:10
MICHELLE And, um -- 

00:22:20
[sil.] 

00:22:20
MICHELLE  I really appreciate my husband. I mean, technically we're still married. He's in private practice and he needs insurance and I've got insurance, so, um, we stay married -- 

00:22:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER So -- 

00:22:40
MICHELLE -- because he needs the insurance. 

00:22:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER So -- 

00:22:40
MICHELLE So -- 

00:22:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- are you implying you like him and he's a good -- 

00:22:45
MICHELLE Oh, yeah. We have a -- 

00:22:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- good person? 

00:22:45
MICHELLE -- great parenting -- co-parenting relationship. I mean -- 

00:22:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER That's terrific. 

00:22:50
MICHELLE Yeah. I'm very -- very proud of the fact that we work so well together with our kids and -- 

00:22:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:22:55
MICHELLE In fact, for Thanksgiving, it was me, my cousin, his mom and dad, him, his girlfriend, um, his brother, sister, his other sister. 

00:23:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:23:05
MICHELLE And they were at my house. So I only had my cousin. 

00:23:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:23:10
MICHELLE They were all his family. 

00:23:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:23:10
MICHELLE Yeah. So it was nice, you know? 

00:23:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER But can you accept the -- the beauty of that kind of coordination of differences and not having grudges and doing the best you can and -- 

00:23:25
MICHELLE Yeah. I feel very sad that, um -- you know, that I hurt him so much. 

00:23:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, that you hurt him so much. Yeah. 

00:23:40
MICHELLE Cuz he's a good man. 

00:23:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Yeah. Well, tell me about him. 

00:23:50
MICHELLE Um, well, he cares deeply about, um, our family and making sure -- 

00:24:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:24:00
MICHELLE -- the kids are okay and about other people. 

00:24:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:24:05
MICHELLE Um, again, he's a private practice clinician and, um, um, he, of course, was wounded when I came out. 

00:24:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER What? 

00:24:20
MICHELLE He was wounded when I came out. 

00:24:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Of course, but what else could you do? 

00:24:25
MICHELLE I couldn't, because I had to take care of me. 

00:24:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, it's not only you, but it's him and the kids and -- 

00:24:35
MICHELLE Because they were seeing -- 

00:24:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- every -- everybody. 

00:24:35
MICHELLE -- they were seeing a relationship that wasn't healthy because I was not okay. 

00:24:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, it sounds like you took the bull by the horns and did what you had to do. 

00:24:40
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:24:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER And, um, well, how is that for you? I mean, you can't get past the sense that you're doing something bad, or -- 

00:24:55
MICHELLE Um -- 

00:24:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER I mean, how hurt is he? 

00:25:00
MICHELLE He's -- he's better now. For a while there, I didn't know what was going to happen, though. 

00:25:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:25:05
MICHELLE Yeah. I didn't know -- 

00:25:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, how does it feel to be so loved? Never mind the matter of the sexuality and such, but how is it for you to be so loved? 

00:25:15
MICHELLE That's -- that's hard for me. Um, um, uh, I almost -- I -- I like that he loved me so much -- 

00:25:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes. 

00:25:40
MICHELLE -- and that he wanted to make sure everything was okay. And even though he mourned the loss of our relationship as he knew it and, um, came out of that okay, um -- 

00:26:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, do you remember the question I asked you? 

00:26:05
MICHELLE No. 

00:26:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER How is it to be so loved? 

00:26:05
MICHELLE "To be so loved". I'd say sometimes I don't feel so loved. I mean, I can under -- I can feel that he love -- that I've been loved, but I tend to avoid being loved. 

00:26:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER I understand that -- 

00:26:25
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:26:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- especially when -- 

00:26:25
MICHELLE And I don't -- 

00:26:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- I'm asking you these questions. 

00:26:25
MICHELLE Yes. And I -- I have a hard time feeling loved from people. 

00:26:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes, that's exactly why -- 

00:26:30
MICHELLE I know. 

00:26:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- I want to know more, because that seems like a horrible waste to feel loved -- how many people are loved the way you're being loved, even though you can't do what the loving person would like you to do but he still loves you? Now, that's a fantastic event. It's not an ordinary everyday thing. Now, you could see that as a blessing or a curse that somehow your loveness gets mixed up with the fact that you hurt him and you're therefore -- something bad about you. But I want -- I want you to take in for a moment the fact, with all of these unhappy aspects, that you're loved. 

00:27:20
MICHELLE Yes, I am. 

00:27:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Live with it. 

00:27:25
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:27:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Get used to it! 

00:27:30
MICHELLE Kind of, wear it like a hat. All righty, then. 

00:27:40
[sil.] 

00:27:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER What are you feeling now? 

00:27:50
MICHELLE  Um, tightness in my chest has loosened up a lot. 

00:27:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER  I'm sorry I asked you the question, because you feel a tightness, but -- 

00:28:05
MICHELLE No, it's loosened up. That's good. 

00:28:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER It did loosen up? 

00:28:10
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:28:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:28:10
MICHELLE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:28:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:28:10
MICHELLE So -- 

00:28:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Uh-huh. Well, this may be a very key thing in what we're doing, because what you want is to be able to not have some sense of contradiction between love and sex and commitment, and that somehow or another one or the other of those -- that triad could exist for you without necessarily having the others. 

00:28:45
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:28:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER And then the others might come. Tell me some things you love. "I love" what? 

00:28:55
MICHELLE I love, um, when my boys wake up in the morning on a weekend and they just cuddle up with me -- 

00:29:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:29:05
MICHELLE -- even my hundred-pound big guy. 

00:29:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER How -- how old is he? 

00:29:10
MICHELLE He's 11. 

00:29:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER 11. 

00:29:10
MICHELLE And he still wants to climb up on my lap, and I'm going to let him do that as long as he can -- 

00:29:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:29:15
MICHELLE --you know, as long as he wants to. 

00:29:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes. Fantastic. 

00:29:20
MICHELLE Oh, I love it. 

00:29:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, yeah? 

00:29:20
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:29:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:29:20
MICHELLE It's sweet. 

00:29:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay, tell me some more about what you love. 

00:29:25
MICHELLE I love, um, minimum days at school. 

00:29:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Minimum days in school? 

00:29:40
MICHELLE No, minimum days at school. Yeah, getting out -- 

00:29:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER What does that mean? 

00:29:40
MICHELLE Getting out early. When we get out early. 

00:29:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER What, you're in school? 

00:29:45
MICHELLE No, I'm a counselor at schools. So -- 

00:29:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, I -- 

00:29:50
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:29:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER I get it. I get it. 

00:29:55
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:29:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER I get it. 

00:29:55
MICHELLE So -- elementary 

00:29:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, tell me about your minimum days in school and what you love about that. 

00:30:00
MICHELLE Minimum days? 11:30 we're out the door. It's nice. I don't have to pick up the kids. I got free afternoon. Very nice. I love, um, the energy that my cats bring to my home. 

00:30:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER Uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:30:15
MICHELLE I love, um, when I actually exercise. 

00:30:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER What do you mean when you actually? You mean as -- as contrasted with pseudo exercise? 

00:30:30
MICHELLE When I get my booty to the gym and actually do it. 

00:30:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:30:35
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:30:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Instead of just wishing you would. Yeah. 

00:30:35
MICHELLE Yeah. Exactly. 

00:30:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER So you like the physical aspect? 

00:30:40
MICHELLE Um-hum. I like feeling strong and healthy and -- 

00:30:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER So what do you do physically? Do you do weights or do you -- 

00:30:45
MICHELLE I do weights, I do machines, classes. 

00:30:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Do you run? 

00:30:50
MICHELLE Nah, running's bad for you, man. 

00:30:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER What? 

00:30:55
MICHELLE Running's bad for your knees and -- I hate running. I make excuses not to do it. 

00:31:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:31:05
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:31:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah 

00:31:05
MICHELLE Because I just don't like it. 

00:31:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Now, do you do all that alone, or do you do that with other people? 

00:31:10
MICHELLE I -- I'm -- I'm alone around people. I am at the gym, but I am in my own little bubble. 

00:31:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:31:15
MICHELLE Um-hum. 

00:31:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER  When you say you're alone around people -- 

00:31:20
MICHELLE Um-hum. 

00:31:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- are you just talking about the gym or are you talking about other situations? 

00:31:25
MICHELLE Basically at the gym is where I do my workouts at. But, um -- 

00:31:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER You don't feel that way elsewhere? 

00:31:30
MICHELLE Um, a lot of times I do. 

00:31:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Uh-huh. Alone while with others. 

00:31:35
MICHELLE Yeah. Like, the entire time at the conference, I mean, I've been in my own little bubble for the most part. I've talked to a couple of people, but I've been in my bubble. 

00:31:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Would you like to get together with more people? 

00:31:50
MICHELLE Sure. 

00:31:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER And what do you think it would take? 

00:31:55
MICHELLE Mmm, I gotta talk to people. 

00:31:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, and what would you say to them? 

00:32:00
MICHELLE Yeah. "Hey, how're you doing?" You know, the usual -- 

00:32:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, but -- 

00:32:05
MICHELLE -- small talk. 

00:32:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, but -- but, you know, there's a touch of embarrassment around your hilarity. 

00:32:10
MICHELLE There is. 

00:32:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER And I wonder if you're afraid that that embarrassment will get out of hand and you'll feel like a child or, um, someone who doesn't know the ropes, or all the many things that one could feel with other people. 

00:32:30
MICHELLE Hmm. Possibly. I mean, I keep myself -- you know, I have my couple good friends and that's it, and -- 

00:32:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well -- 

00:32:45
MICHELLE -- I keep myself isolated. 

00:32:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- is that okay with you, or -- is that okay with your, or would you like more? 

00:32:45
MICHELLE Well, sometimes I'd like to get out more, yeah. 

00:32:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:32:50
MICHELLE I'd like to get out and have more friends and -- and do something. 

00:32:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Now, what do you imagine it would take to have some relationships here in the convention, doing this or that? What do you think it would take? 

00:33:10
MICHELLE Um, it would take, um, my willingness to put myself out there, to be accepted and to -- to put myself at risk. 

00:33:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER And putting yourself out there means what? I mean, how would you do -- 

00:33:30
MICHELLE To kind of put myself., um, at risk of being rejected in some ways. 

00:33:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, rejected. That's -- 

00:33:35
MICHELLE Hmm. 

00:33:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, hmm. 

00:33:35
MICHELLE Hmm. 

00:33:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah! 

00:33:35
MICHELLE I see. 

00:33:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER  We understand. Yeah, okay. Now, do you imagine people would want to be with you, or not? 

00:33:45
MICHELLE Um, maybe. 

00:33:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Uh-huh. Maybe. Yes. 

00:33:50
MICHELLE Yes. 

00:33:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Uh-huh. I'll betcha anything there are many of them who would. How does it feel to hear that from me? 

00:34:00
MICHELLE  Hmm, I have my doubts. 

00:34:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER You have your doubts. 

00:34:10
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:34:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER Should we put it to a test? 

00:34:10
MICHELLE Oh, God! Oh! 

00:34:20
[sil.] 

00:34:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Would you be willing -- oh, this is terrible. 

00:34:30
MICHELLE You kill me. 

00:34:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER I can't believe I'm doing this. Would you be willing to say "Here I am standing here in front of you"? 

00:34:40
MICHELLE Here I am standing here in front of you. 

00:34:45
MICHELLE Oh, boy. 

00:34:50
[sil.] 

00:34:50
MICHELLE Oh, man. Woo. And now that I turned around, there's a lot of you out there. 

00:35:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay, I think -- I think the vote is very clear. 

00:35:05
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:35:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER The question is where the risk is for you. And I -- I want to go back for a moment in terms of your embarrassment to be -- I think, embarrassment to be loved, or whether you have a right to be loved. Now crying comes. 

00:35:25
MICHELLE Oh! 

00:35:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes, let it -- yeah. 

00:35:40
[sil.] 

00:35:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:35:50
[sil.] 

00:35:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Yeah. 

00:36:15
MICHELLE Good job. 

00:36:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, yeah. Yes. It's so great. It's such a refreshment. 

00:36:30
[sil.] 

00:36:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER  What comes to your mind? 

00:36:40
MICHELLE How very small I feel. 

00:36:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Small, yeah. 

00:36:45
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:36:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. And small means what to you? 

00:36:50
MICHELLE Um, vulnerable. 

00:36:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Vulnerable. You're vulnerable to crying. 

00:36:55
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:36:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER And what happened when you cried? 

00:37:00
MICHELLE Um -- 

00:37:10
[sil.] 

00:37:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER It wasn't so bad, was it? 

00:37:20
MICHELLE No. 

00:37:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER But maybe that's one of the things -- I'm sure there are others -- that you're vulnerable to. Small and vulnerable. Your kids are -- your kids are small and vulnerable and you love them. 

00:37:35
MICHELLE Yes. 

00:37:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Can one not be loved if one is small and vulnerable? 

00:37:40
MICHELLE Yes, you can be. 

00:37:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes, but can you? 

00:37:45
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:37:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Yeah. 

00:37:50
MICHELLE I'm always trying so hard to be so strong and -- 

00:37:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER So what? 

00:37:55
MICHELLE So strong and -- 

00:37:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well -- 

00:37:55
MICHELLE -- so impenetrable most of the time. 

00:38:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER My dear, you don't have to try to be strong. You are strong. You're setting up certain criteria that don't -- where you don't qualify. 

00:38:05
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:38:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER You know, I'm sitting here with you and I feel your strength, I feel your character. 

00:38:25
[sil.] 

00:38:25
MICHELLE Thank you. 

00:38:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:38:30
MICHELLE Oh, man. 

00:38:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, man, what? 

00:38:35
MICHELLE  Hmm. 

00:38:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:38:40
MICHELLE  It just feels -- now I'm just feeling very -- a little more relaxed. 

00:38:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Do you think maybe you could allow a little love to come into you in the next days or weeks or months? 

00:39:00
MICHELLE I could certainly try. 

00:39:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Could take a chance on love coming in and not feeling that you, therefore -- the moment there's a love thing, that you suddenly owe somebody something? I'm not saying you shouldn't care about other people or be reckless. But you're not. That's not one of your dangers. You weren't reckless with your husband. 

00:39:20
MICHELLE No. 

00:39:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER No, you did what -- what you could, and that's a part of your character. 

00:39:25
MICHELLE Um-hum. 

00:39:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER How would it -- how would it be if we were to stop at that point? 

00:39:35
[sil.] 

00:39:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER With the idea that maybe you've gotten some feelings that show you how much love there is in you and how much love there would be for you if you didn't feel boxed in by it or in some way guilty about it, but allowing your charm and your hilarity to be a part of your relationships? I'm sure they must be. You didn't just invent them here. 

00:40:05
MICHELLE No. 

00:40:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER You've been doing it for a while. You -- 

00:40:10
MICHELLE When I let them out 

00:40:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER That always with a touch in the background of embarrassment about it, but -- 

00:40:15
MICHELLE Embarrassment. 

00:40:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- but you can get over that. 

00:40:15
MICHELLE Mmm. Okay. 

00:40:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER What do you want to say to me now? 

00:40:25
MICHELLE Um, I can feel how I can be open to being loved and bringing that love in. 

00:40:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Now can you say that actually looking at me and taking me in while you're saying it? 

00:40:50
MICHELLE Okay. I can feel how I can be open to love and bringing the love in -- 

00:40:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Uh-huh. 

00:40:55
MICHELLE -- and how you're bringing good feelings to me right now. 

00:41:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes. 

00:41:00
MICHELLE And I can appreciate that. 

00:41:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes. Okay, now that was a little subdued, a little restrained, but -- 

00:41:10
MICHELLE I'm learning, right? 

00:41:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER What? What? 

00:41:15
MICHELLE I'm learning. 

00:41:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER You're learning. 

00:41:15
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:41:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, yeah. Yeah. 

00:41:15
MICHELLE I need practice. 

00:41:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Fantastic. 

00:41:20
MICHELLE Yeah. Okay. 

00:41:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay. 

00:41:20
MICHELLE Thank you very much. 

00:41:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER It's a pleasure. 

00:41:20
MICHELLE You're a sweetheart. 

00:41:30
[sil.] 

00:41:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER  Now, that was very moving to me, and, uh, there's got to be a transition into, um, what shall I call it, the principles of therapy. What was in that session? What was there that we can all get some sense of as a part of what we might do? Because one of the things I think of when we have this kind of, um, teaching situation is that not only do we learn something new, but we also celebrate what we already do. There's some way in which whatever happens in this demonstration of therapy reveals things which are not only true of this session, but are also true of the way many of you work, and experiences that you've had. And it's important to be able to tie together the -- the relationship between, uh, what you want to learn and what you can already do, and not to separate them. So I wonder what you see, whether -- what questions you might have about this session that we might talk about, that would amplify your own sense of what the therapy session is about. 

00:43:50
[sil.] 

00:43:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, uh, I'm wondering is there some way -- is this -- 

00:44:10
UNKNOWN Hello. 

00:44:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER I don't -- 

00:44:15
UNKNOWN Hi. 

00:44:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER I don't know whether -- are there -- yeah, I see you. I see you now. 

00:44:20
UNKNOWN Okay. Well, um, what I saw happening was that you, um, you so gently invited her pain, whatever it was, to just come and sit with you and gently come out. And I -- I really loved how you -- you didn't try to rescue her from it, um, you didn't react terr -- you know, too positive or too negative. You just kind of invited it and embraced it and -- and teased it out and allowed it to just kind of evolve. Um, that's what I saw happening. 

00:45:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Well, that's -- that's a part of honoring the focus on what already exists, rather than being driven toward changing somebody, because that quality of harmonizing the internal feeling with whatever's going on in the relationship is a spur toward movement forward because it's a lubricant. So in a sense, in trying to get things moving in therapy, I think we tried to lubricate the process. When people want to move and are stuck, they need some way to slide into the next moment. And if the next moment is always a natural next moment where it's -- it's easy, it's not requiring anything but it's going in a direction that matters, you can't just be capricious about it. But starting that movement forward, if it's done in a -- in a sense of mutuality, is a lubricant for continuing to do it. And then eventually things come out which previously couldn't. Okay. 

00:46:25
UNKNOWN What I really admire about this session was your curiosity, uh, playfulness, focus and gentleness. It was amazing. 

00:46:40
[sil.] 

00:46:40
UNKNOWN Should I go to the mic? 

00:46:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, please do. 

00:46:50
UNKNOWN I was so impressed at the courage of both you and your, um -- 

00:46:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, here -- 

00:46:50
UNKNOWN -- participant, that you could -- 

00:46:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Where? Over there? 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN Here. Right over here. 

00:47:00
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, I just have -- 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN Over on the left. 

00:47:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER I -- I can't see you, so I'm just going to have to assure myself that I'm not hearing voices. Okay, now -- now I got -- 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN You are hearing voices, but there are real people behind them. 

00:47:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER What? Yeah. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN I -- I know as a therapist myself that empathy with someone who is trying not to cry, particularly in a situation where they're exposing their vulnerability very publicly, would be hard -- it would be hard to resist helping them protect themselves from further vulnerability and exposure. 

00:47:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER Helping them take -- 

00:47:35
UNKNOWN And you went right into it. You didn't hold back, and you allowed her to go right into it, and that took great courage on both parts. Thank you. 

00:47:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, her -- her cry was so apparent early, and it was so moving, that I -- I cried. I had a sense of not wanting to intrude mine into -- into hers. But it was a very moving moment, because eruptions from stuckness are always moving because there's -- there's a sense of release. It's, uh, uh -- yeah, okay. 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN Um, I just thought it was really interesting the way you were able to kind of notice and name certain physiological things that were going on, like her affect around, like, 'that's an embarrassed cry,' or talking about the way she was laughing, that it was -- it was deep, that there was a way in which you were describing her affect that allowed her to kind of go into what she was feeling. 

00:48:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes. Well, now, that's interesting from the standpoint of not being, what shall I call it, obvious and not probably within her awareness, though she may have some sense of it. But it's a, um -- it's a statement that says "I'm almost there, but I'm just too embarrassed to do it." And it plays around the corners of her mouth. And I take a chance on putting a word on it, because, after all, it's a physical expression, and it doesn't have a synonym. So I give it the word "embarrassment". I suppose many of you might have given it some other word, but many words would have served the purpose. And, uh -- thank you. And, uh -- so one of the things that I am much aware of when I do therapy is how to bring things in that are almost there and the person doesn't know it, so that they can include that which they're not sure it belongs in the system, because basically we all want to feel whole. So if you have this characteristic going on and this one says "I'm here, but I can't come out," well, you can't feel whole until that comes into the picture. Then when it does, it may or may not be very frightening. And in this case with Michelle, uh, she wasn't as frightened as she is thinking she is. It's a funny way to put it, because if she's thinking it, well, then she is. But, no, she seems very robust and she has qualities which, for one reason or another, the positive sides of her -- I'm only guessing now, but somehow the sides of her feel those -- those better qualities bring on obligations that she's not willing to take on. And that puts too much of a burden on the particular -- particular feeling. Yeah? 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN Um, well, considering what you just said, is this why -- I don't know if is this a reason why you do not probe further, because I was curious about spirituality, family, her parents, how her children feel, if those impact her thoughts. Or is that something that -- 

00:51:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh. 

00:51:45
UNKNOWN -- you want her to -- 

00:51:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, no, no. I think they're very important, but you can't do everything in one session, so I had to make a choice. I mean, her kids would be very interesting to know more about. I gave her opportunity to talk about that. But -- so there wasn't -- 

00:52:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:52:05
DR. ERVING POLSTER There wasn't a lot of history, though there was some. There's some important history in there, if you think of history as not necessarily from the way past -- way-gone past, but history of her life in her marriage and since her marriage and -- so there was some storyline in there. But there is so much more story in anybody's life than you can possibly tap into in any particular moment. So I pretty much left it up to her as to where she would go with that, and I didn't press for anything about her parents. I -- I didn't feel like her parents were a part of this picture. Yeah? Yes. 

00:52:50
UNKNOWN Hi. 

00:52:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh. 

00:52:50
UNKNOWN Um, thank you for both of your bravery and letting us witness such a beautiful session. Um, there was this very poignant and beautiful moment when you had her stand and turn to us, and we were able to give this resounding affirmation of her ability to be loved. Um, and beautiful and poetic and appropriate, I think, for this setting.What I'm curious about is, if we weren't here in that moment, do you choose to assure somebody of that yourself, or would you wonder with her about where that comes from? Like, how -- where -- 

00:53:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER I -- 

00:53:25
UNKNOWN What is your approach on that? 

00:53:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, I think that's a terrific question because it has all kinds of implications for the future of therapy or for the role of community in therapy. And there's something about -- one of the things we do in therapy is to amplify experience that's been neutralized. So any time I can amplify something which I feel is rightfully hers but is neutralized, I do it because she has -- she deserves to have that more in her foreground, if you will. Now, if I were doing it in a private session, um, I don't know, I certainly couldn't duplicate this -- 

00:54:05
UNKNOWN Right. Luck. 

00:54:10
DR. ERVING POLSTER -- which is not to say I should waste it either. Uh, but there is something about what it takes to be affirmed that is very important.I know in our training programs, one of the things we tried one time was an exercise which -- which went like this: One person would get up and say their name, and the group -- and there'd be 32 people there -- the group would all applaud for a full minute. All they had to do was say their name. It is a fantastic experience. Try it some time. It's not that easy to absorb all of that affirmation, but it's a very important thing to be oriented toward the affirming quality.Now, psychotherapists very commonly think of affirmation as, um, creating dependency, and won't do much affirming because they don't want to be the ones that are being depended on for the affirmation. But I think it's a totally wrong perspective. I -- I think you can overdo affirmation, I think you can be phony about affirmation, but real honest-to-goodness authentic affirmation coming from a therapist is not going to make people more dependent; it's going to make them more free. So I remember one time somebody called me on the telephone -- this is a long time ago when I was still in private practice -- and she was going out of -- out of town, but she was very anxious. So I talked with her on the phone. And, uh, after we talked for a while, she felt much better and she said 'But I'm going out of town and you're not going to be there.' So I said 'Well, you just imagine me there and what I would say to you and what you would say to me, and see how that works.' Now a lot of people would think of that as me fostering dependency. Not at all. That fosters security. It fosters assurance. It fosters a sense of authenticity of -- of giving and -- and of relationship and -- those things are not what foster depend -- good relationships don't foster dependency; they foster freedom and they foster feeling-fulness. So I think it -- it's a good point you make. Though in -- in private therapy -- I still haven't quite answered the question, have I? I might -- I might have asked her to imagine somebody to whom she was asking whether she would be interesting enough to them. 

00:56:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:56:55
DR. ERVING POLSTER I mean, I might. I don't know whether I would, but there -- there would be those options that could still happen. Or I might ask her 'What do you think -- what do you think I feel about your appealingness?' Or 'What do you think' -- and maybe she would have mentioned somebody else in her life. 'What do you think so-and-so feels about it?' So there would be ways of getting at it, but nothing would reproduce the power of the community to create affirmation and belonging. 

00:57:20
UNKNOWN Yeah -- 

00:57:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay, where am I on, on time? Okay. We have -- 

00:57:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, please -- I'm -- yeah. I was -- I'm over here. No, to your right. 

00:57:35
DR. ERVING POLSTER To my right? 

00:57:35
UNKNOWN No, your left, your left, your left. 

00:57:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh. 

00:57:40
UNKNOWN To your left. 

00:57:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER On my left. 

00:57:40
UNKNOWN No, over here. 

00:57:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER My left. Okay. 

00:57:40
UNKNOWN To your left. 

00:57:40
UNKNOWN My sinister side. Okay. 

00:57:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:57:45
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yes, there you are. 

00:57:45
UNKNOWN Okay. I was so very, very much impressed by your response to when she says 'Yes, I know my husband loves me,' and you did not do a great deal during that little interaction, except you ended that interaction with this kind of gesture. And then at the very, very end of the session, as she was leaving, she also went 'Ah' -- 

00:58:15
DR. ERVING POLSTER Yeah, she -- yeah. That's a very interesting thing. She got my lightness and it was contagious and she felt free to do it, but it's hers. 

00:58:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:58:20
DR. ERVING POLSTER She did it like she really knew how. 

00:58:25
UNKNOWN Yes. And I just loved that. Thank you so very much. 

00:58:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER But -- but also, I, uh -- she gave me the clue about her husband, that I would not have expected. I didn't know that they still had an -- a -- a -- still had a loving relationship. It came up as the sequences went on. And then of course, when you start with any particular phenomenon, loving being one, to find somebody already having it and accepting it and recognizing it, is a lot easier than creating some new one. So, the problem very often is -- I think this is a very important part of therapy -- people very often have what they want and don't know they have it. 

00:59:25
[sil.] 

00:59:25
DR. ERVING POLSTER Okay. 

00:59:25
UNKNOWN Hello? Oh. Do you have time for one more? 

00:59:30
DR. ERVING POLSTER Uh, do we have time for one more? One minute. 

00:59:30
UNKNOWN Okay I'm to your right. The other right. Hi. Um, so I was curious. At one point Michelle started to say that she thought her laughter was covering up something. 

00:59:40
DR. ERVING POLSTER Oh, yes! 

00:59:40
UNKNOWN And you said, um, that that's not a defense. And I was wondering if you could talk more about that. 

00:59:50
DR. ERVING POLSTER Well, uh, somehow or another, people get the idea that if you're having pleasure, it's a defense against pain. And laughter is one of them. People think that if you laugh with your patients, you're -- you're, um, slipping off the real things. Laughter is a lubricant, not a distraction, unless, you use it as a distraction. That wasn't the way I felt about it. I think laughter is a very important part of a therapeutic experience, as long as it doesn't interfere with a natural progression that's going on, that it disrupts. But otherwise, fun is not a bad idea where improvement is sought. Okay. Thank you.
