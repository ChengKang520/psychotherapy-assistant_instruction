MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Hi, my name is Matt Englar-Carlson and I'm the host of the Counseling Theories in Action Video Series. Theory is the compass that allows counselors to navigate the vast territory of clinical practice. In the same ways that navigational tools have been modified to adapt to advances in thinking and ever expanding territories to explore. Theories of counseling have changed over time to integrate advances in science, to adapt to the broad range of presenting concerns, and most importantly, to be more inclusive on the full range of cultural identities that our clients embodied. We do know that counselors adopt and practice according to one theory or another because their experience and decades of good evidence suggests that having a sound theory of counseling leads to greater therapeutic success. A sound theory helps the client and counselor makes sense of a client's experiences and they're presenting concern. Theory also guides actions towards successful outcomes while generating hope in both the counselor and client that recovery is possible. There are many different counseling theories and that wide variety is a testament, the different ways in which the same human behavior can be conceptualized. But also the different ways that counseling can be practiced. This video series presents different theoretical approaches to counseling, with the emphasis on different theoretical based interventions. The viewer will get a chance to see how professionals make sense of their chosen theoretical model and also then observe that model in action.

MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Hi, Kathy. 

00:01:45
KATHERINE HELM Hi, Matt. 

00:01:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON In this video you're gonna show us six techniques uh… from a psychodynamic perspective. But before we get to show those techniques, let's get to know you a bit more in terms of why you liked this approach. 

00:02:00
KATHERINE HELM Sure. Umm… Well, you know, right now I am a professor in the program (inaudible) Darker for Clinical Mental Health Counseling Program. Umm… Not only sort of, was I, heavily influenced by my own clinical supervisors who were psycho dynamically oriented. But when I was a kid, my dad, who was going back to graduate school when I was a kid would talk all about it. 

00:02:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Wow. 

00:02:20
KATHERINE HELM And so I really sort of started viewing people that way. And one of the things that attracts me to the psychodynamic approach, is this developmental perspective, the idea that people go through series of developmental stages. 

00:02:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:02:35
KATHERINE HELM Umm… That early childhood experiences influence us throughout our lives. And some of the concepts with psychodynamic theory I'm really kind of attracted to. 

00:02:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. What's sound uncommon. It seems like when we learned about theories, that the theory that… that fits us best, that helps us most explain our life is one that we're drawn to. 

00:02:55
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. I… I would definitely say that I've kind of always been fascinated with this idea that, you're in childhood for such a small amount of time but it has such a profound influence on who we become as individuals. 

00:03:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. And it influence in terms of how you see the world at some… 

00:03:05
KATHERINE HELM That's right. 

00:03:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:03:05
KATHERINE HELM That's right. 

00:03:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So when you think about…about psychodynamic what are the core concepts that come to mind? 

00:03:15
KATHERINE HELM I think several core concepts uh… come to mind. You know, I want to highlight that. When we teach about this theory, we start with psychoanalysis, which is a far stricter form. You know, Freud and sort of the traditional kind of psycho analytic ways of viewing things. Psychodynamic has sort of grown up a bit if you will. 

00:03:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:03:35
KATHERINE HELM Umm… It tends to be a briefer form of therapy but it still gives a nod to looking at unconscious motivations, umm… relational patterns, how our earlier developments influences us over the lifespan, resistance, kind of this idea of insight, right? 

00:03:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

00:03:55
KATHERINE HELM Looking at why we do the things that we do, as well as the strong relationship and connection from counselor to client. 

00:04:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. So there's this aspect in terms of… of looking at the, at his origins, right? So… so Freud and the kind of the birth of… of really counseling and therapy. Umm… But if we look at… look at modern approaches, maybe keeps some of the same concepts but the actual practice is quite different. 

00:04:15
KATHERINE HELM Yes. And not… not only that but, you know, I think that none of us use one particular theory in isolation. And so I find that psychodynamic is a good conceptual lens for me to understand the clients that I'm working with, even if what I'm actually doing in the room might look different, my lens really helps me understand people. 

00:04:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. You mentioned having some exposure with your father. Umm… What other kind of training you'd receive to better apply psychodynamic theory? 

00:04:45
KATHERINE HELM So I had several psycho dynamically oriented supervisors. 

00:04:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:04:45
KATHERINE HELM And I think they really helped me realize what a powerful lens it is, just sort of really understand people it's, you know, not necessarily a problem focused approach, it's broader and it helps us really look behind a particular problem or issue that a client is presenting with. 

00:05:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So it sounds like your supervisors, that you're kind of early training Master's level and so forth and that really stuck with you? 

00:05:10
KATHERINE HELM Very much so. 

00:05:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Umm… And then you began to… began to conceptualize clients that way and then… 

00:05:15
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. I think I was sort of always attracted to it because of its focus on development. 

00:05:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:05:20
KATHERINE HELM Umm… But, you know, they really kind of helped me hone those skills in that conceptual lens. 

00:05:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So as a counselor working from… from psychodynamic perspective, what do you assessing and looking for in your clients? 

00:05:35
KATHERINE HELM For me I am always looking for patterns, right. 

00:05:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:05:40
KATHERINE HELM Umm… That sort of repeat overtime. Sometimes clients are aware of these patterns. They say sort of why do I continue to date the same type of person or why do my relationships end in this way? So I'm always sort of listening for patterns and I'm always looking behind sort of a presenting issue for the multiple reasons why it might exist and I collaborate with clients to really kind of explore that. 

00:06:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So there's that why question. And I think with the psychodynamic because of the role of insight, right? 

00:06:05
KATHERINE HELM That's right. 

00:06:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, that why question is what approach (inaudible) and be quite good for. 

00:06:10
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:06:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:06:15
KATHERINE HELM That is a very powerful question. And I think, Matt, in some ways there can be a lot of healing in understanding the why of things. 

00:06:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. So there are these patterns you listen for in terms of experiences and stories your clients tell you. And then there's also this other aspect in terms of the patterns you probably experienced with the client in the moment. 

00:06:30
KATHERINE HELM Very much so. So I'm also trying to be attuned to kind of the relational patterns that my client and I are creating together and what's happening between the client and I. 

00:06:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So how do you tailor adapt your… your approach to the broad range of clients that we see in their intersecting identities? 

00:06:50
KATHERINE HELM Mm-hmm… So I think that's a great question because all counselors should seek to do that. We should all uh… be able to work flexibly with clients and sort of apply theories in understanding who our client is in… in ways that are not sort of dogmatic. 

00:07:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:07:05
KATHERINE HELM And so for me taking a multicultural lens and really understanding who a client is, what's important to them, what are their values, what are the contexts in which they sort of live in. I mean, all of us have kind of intersecting identities. And to do good counseling work, and I think psychodynamic really prepares us in some ways to look at how multiple identities really influence who we are. 

00:07:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. And the origins approach of course would be kind of Western Europe and maybe with Freud originally who primarily saw female patients… 

00:07:35
KATHERINE HELM Right. 

00:07:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. And now we will look at the range of clients that…that we work with. We can see anyone. We'll see everyone. 

00:07:45
KATHERINE HELM That's right. Umm… You know, sort of kind of building on that point, umm… you can't really use psychoanalysis or any theory really well unless you do understand those contextual variables. And so what are the things that, you know, as we sort of talked together today we'll look at the skill of interpretation. But to… Where you sort of take something that is happening with the client and you kind of come to a new understanding about it. You can't really do that without looking at the contexts in which these things are occurring. 

00:08:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. So in many ways that may not have been a part of a theory at its origins but we think about now and kind of modern practice, the role of kind of contexts plays with… with almost any interpretation or intervention that use. 

00:08:25
KATHERINE HELM That's right. I think so. 

00:08:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. And how do you decide and kind of tailor interventions to your clients? How do you know what to use and when? 

00:08:35
KATHERINE HELM So that's another great question. Umm… I think a couple of ways. For me, I always try to keep a few things in… in mind. One, I'm not perfect. 

00:08:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:08:40
KATHERINE HELM And so, you know, kind of making mistakes in relationships with clients is actually important because it models the fact that I'm a human being. 

00:08:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

00:08:50
KATHERINE HELM But I view this as a very collaborative process. So I take into account a few things. One, how long have the client and I've been working together? 

00:09:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:09:00
KATHERINE HELM You know, what… Do I feel like I have a good relationship and rapport with the client? Kind of, what's the client's presenting issue? But I'm also evaluating in the moment, tone of voice, body posture, facial expression. Umm… Sometimes even a sigh, uh… means for me that there's some emotional processing happening. So I'm sort of trying to be attuned to things that are happening in the session which helped really decide what intervention I used. Umm… Another important thing is, after I use an intervention I will frequently check-in with the client and ask them how they've received what I've said or how they're processing it, which can help turn sort of intervention that didn't go so well into a better intervention or I can learn how to sort of modify what I'm doing with this client. 

00:09:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. So again it goes back to this idea that this is really the relational approach, right? And that relationship is kind of that core and I hear that, intellectually your brain is working and making sense of what's past pattern, what's going on. But then really what's happening between you and the client is what's gonna dictate kinda… kinda what you use? 

00:10:10
KATHERINE HELM Yes. Yes. So I might be thinking of doing this intervention next but something might happen in that space where I may completely change my mind. 

00:10:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. I also hear what you said earlier is that, again that you're not perfect, right? 

00:10:20
KATHERINE HELM Right. Absolutely not. 

00:10:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh… But there's some humility, it sounds like in that relationship that also is really genuine with their clients that can then be an intervention in many ways. 

00:10:30
KATHERINE HELM I would hope so. I mean, I hope that in some ways looking through a psychodynamic lens, this relationship between myself and my client can't be emotionally corrective of an experience that has happened before or theme where they've been heard in a relationship, right? And then this relationship can kind of sustain or process that hurt. So my not being perfect and the client not being perfect. You know, you're modeling in perfect. Yeah, carrying human relationship and I think that's really important. 

00:11:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. Is there an ideal client for this approach? 

00:11:05
KATHERINE HELM So I don't want to say that there's an ideal client, but I find that people who really want to understand why, right? So for example, clients who, you wouldn't use this approach but you wouldn't use his approach with somebody who's actively psychotic or a client in… in crisis or maybe even a client who's profoundly depressed, because the immediacy of those situations means that this is really not the opportunity to be exploring things. But client's, let's say, if you have a client who's depressed and you've done some kind of cognitive behavioral work and now we want to know why, not just the thoughts, that's sort of, what are my thoughts. But why is this happening? Do I have a parent who criticized me as a child and I've kind of internalized that voice and I hear that? So, you know, individuals in the field who I've seen for therapy, most of us really like understanding and learning about why. And other clients who want to know the answers to that. You know, my benefit from a psychodynamic approach but this can also be combined with other approaches. 

00:12:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So it sounds like, at the onset, if someone is in kind of… kind of acute distress, this may not be the approach to kind of give them some… some… some relief immediately. 

00:12:20
KATHERINE HELM Right. 

00:12:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON The client… You want a client who maybe is inquisitive or, uh… but has the ability to kind of reflect back. 

00:12:25
KATHERINE HELM Mm-hmm… 

00:12:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Umm… So that would always be like… like the ideal client for this. 

00:12:30
KATHERINE HELM Sure. 

00:12:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

00:12:30
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:12:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. And then my hunch is that there's obviously, we think about psychodynamic, we often think long-term, but certainly brief approaches as well. 

00:12:40
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. I mean, the psychodynamic therapy I think is adaptable and flexible. And so, you know, you might… You know, they always sort of say in a textbook. Don't do an interpretation right away, right? Umm… But in actual practice, it really depends on that dynamic between you and the client. You might actually do an interpretation right away and the client might actually be ready or maybe not. If not, then you sort of put it in the back of your mind as the counselor and sort of decide, you know, where you're going from there. 

00:13:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. So what I hear kind of saying is that, there's a way in which we practice approach but these rules are written in pencil. 

00:13:15
KATHERINE HELM That's right. That's right. 

00:13:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. So this is an approach that you use in practice, umm… but you also teach it to students? 

00:13:25
KATHERINE HELM I do. 

00:13:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So when you teach it to students, what do you want students to know? 

00:13:30
KATHERINE HELM So what I really want students to know is, of course being a person who likes to teach this. You're more psychodynamically oriented that you actually think you are. 

00:13:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:13:40
KATHERINE HELM Umm… Students here about Freud's psychosexual stages and they are not a fan of that. 

00:13:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:13:45
KATHERINE HELM Right? They think the idea that, you know, infants have sexual feelings. A lot of them sort of can't get on board with that. 

00:13:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

00:13:50
KATHERINE HELM But what they can get along when I, you know, get on with what I say, but look at the developmental approach. You may not like what he had to say about the stages, but look at what sort of we kind of examined in terms of being developmentally stuck. 

00:14:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:14:05
KATHERINE HELM Umm… How do we take, you know, some of the basic concepts of psychodynamic theory and understand how we get stuck. So I'll give you an example. Umm… You know, trauma can allow someone to be developmentally stuck. So chronologically a client might be 50 years old. But let's say emotionally and socially that client got stuck somewhere around 15, maybe through the death of a parent or the loss of a relationship or something like that. And that language and that understanding is really psychodynamic. 

00:14:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:14:35
KATHERINE HELM Right? And so what I really want students to know is not only that the questions of why and gaining insight can be helpful in making longer-term behavioral change, but how do you actually take these kind of concepts and really delve into them and use this as a lens to look deeper. 

00:14:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. So here you can say is that, you don't want students to kind of write it off initially and say, "Oh, that's an antiquated approach." 

00:15:00
KATHERINE HELM That's right. 

00:15:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right? Because a lot has changed since then. 

00:15:00
KATHERINE HELM Right. 

00:15:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh… And I agree with you. What I like about this approach to is that, intellectually it's one of the most rich models that there is. 

00:15:10
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:15:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Umm… And I think it's kinda funny sometimes when, you know, it's… Students could ask this a lot when they're in, but even… even professionals do with people in… in like a social setting, you know. Are you analyzing me? Right? 

00:15:20
KATHERINE HELM Right. Right. 

00:15:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And we're taught to say, "Oh, no, no." 

00:15:25
KATHERINE HELM No. 

00:15:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON But of course we are. 

00:15:25
KATHERINE HELM Of course we are. But shh… don't say anything. Yes. 

00:15:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, but what we're using is often psychodynamic ideas. 

00:15:30
KATHERINE HELM Exactly. And I think that… So, you know, to your point I think that many professionals are more secular dynamically oriented than they actually think they are. Umm… And that's okay. It can be a conceptual lens but it also can be sort of what you're doing in the session with clients. Uh… But it…it really does serve as a powerful tool to look deeper. 

00:15:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And so from that perspective to what I hear you say is that, umm… you can be kind of a purist who kind of works from psychodynamic perspective, right? But you can also be integrative many ways, which is to think psycho dynamically about certain things, right? But maybe be doing other interventions? 

00:16:10
KATHERINE HELM Exactly. Exactly. I don't know too many purest kind of still out there, I'm sure they're some. 

00:16:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:16:15
KATHERINE HELM Umm… But really to be adaptable, you know, all of our lenses… Sort of conceptual lenses may be different but you may, you know, kind of be pulled depending on a client's issue to do psychodynamic therapy, when they say, "Why did these things keep happening? I really want to understand what's happening here." 

00:16:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And it's nice to me. And I would agree with you in a sense that I… I was probably that student too. When I first learned about this approach, I kind of wrote it off and part of it was because I just didn't get it. 

00:16:35
KATHERINE HELM Right. 

00:16:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And late overtime as I, maybe gained more knowledge about the field. I began to see the richness of this model and the tools that provided me, it actually makes sense of the information clients were giving me, the ability to interpret from this approach is really, really helpful. 

00:16:50
KATHERINE HELM That's right. That's right. And…and many approaches that came later sort of build upon these original ideas, modify them overtime, you know. But I really think kind of some of the underpinnings of psychodynamic therapy, sort of look at that attachment relationship even though that language wasn't used then, between parent and child or primary caregiver and child and that, there's a lot of research right now that's happening, that's looking at couple's relationships and relationships between parents and child and I think that a lot of that has it's basis from psychodynamic work. 

00:17:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, it's…it strikes me that there's this, were said earlier that, you might be more… more psychodynamic than you think. 

00:17:25
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:17:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And I'm also thinking about some of the interventions that you use, that again, these interventions umm… maybe psychodynamic in uh… origin. 

00:17:35
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:17:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON But they're freely borrowed across the spectrum other approaches. 

00:17:40
KATHERINE HELM That's right. That's right. So for example the intervention of confrontation, umm… is talked about a lot in psychodynamic therapy. But really you know, many, many other approaches use the idea. They may call it challenge right. 

00:17:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:17:55
KATHERINE HELM Umm… So, you know, interpretation from the psychodynamic perspective involves kind of building on sort of new insights. But sort of cognitive behavioral therapy might call something like that, reframing some things. So, you know, a lot of these ideas about human nature may sort of the language we use kind of changes around the theoretical lens, but a lot of these ideas kind of happen, borrowed across different theories. 

00:18:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

00:18:20
Introduction to Cilent 

00:18:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So in a moment we're gonna get a chance to see your work with a client. Umm… Her name is Maria. And I wonder if you could tell me a bit about Mariam and what she's bringing in. 

00:18:35
KATHERINE HELM Yes. So Maria is in a counseling program. 

00:18:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:18:40
KATHERINE HELM She is in her mid '20s. 

00:18:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:18:40
KATHERINE HELM And she's sort of on the cusp of doing many things. She's a first-generation Mexican-American student. Umm… One of the first people in her family to kind of go to college and graduate school. And she is in a very serious long-term relationship and she's in some ways caught between the values sort of… of her parents, umm… sort of Mexican values as well as sort of being first generation here in the United States. 

00:19:05
PSYCHODYNAMIC THERAPY 

00:19:05
SKILL NUMBER ONE: Working Through 

00:19:05
Working Through 

00:19:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Great. Skill number one: Working Through. What do you mean by Working Through? 

00:19:15
KATHERINE HELM So working through in psychodynamic therapy typically happens after you've been working with the client for quite awhile. 

00:19:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:19:25
KATHERINE HELM Or several sessions at least. 

00:19:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:19:25
KATHERINE HELM And you've done several kind of interpretations, where the client has come to a new understanding. 

00:19:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:19:30
KATHERINE HELM And you're sort of taking the culmination of that and working through this issue with all of these new insights and kind of putting everything together. 

00:19:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So what's the goal of that intervention? Is it insight? 

00:19:45
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. The goal of the intervention is uh… not only insight but to have the client come away with a deeper understanding as well as, if they want to make behavioral change based on this deeper understanding. 

00:19:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So there's… I hear you say that there… it's built upon kind of previous interpretation… 

00:20:00
KATHERINE HELM That's right. 

00:20:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That… that have been offered to the client and maybe it's kind of had bits and pieces of insight. 

00:20:05
KATHERINE HELM Right. 

00:20:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Now this is kind of maybe putting that all together. 

00:20:05
KATHERINE HELM It is. It's kind of the culmination of your work thus far in therapy really getting at the core of the issue. 

00:20:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So in a moment we're gonna see this in action. What should we be looking for in this clip? 

00:20:20
KATHERINE HELM Well, in some ways you should look for sort of, you know, as I bring in bits of our past work together, umm… and sort of what the culmination of that looks like in total. As Maria takes those insights and comes to a new understanding and decides on her course of action. 

00:20:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So you're gonna kind of maybe highlight those pieces that you've done previously… 

00:20:40
KATHERINE HELM That's right. 

00:20:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And you might even say previously you did this. 

00:20:40
KATHERINE HELM Yes. Yes. 

00:20:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. And then what will look for is kind of how Maria maybe puts those pieces of… of the puzzle together. 

00:20:50
KATHERINE HELM That's right. And comes to this kind of understanding of what her course of action is. 

00:20:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good. 

00:20:55
EXAMPLE OF SKILL NUMBER ONE: Working Through 

00:21:00
KATHERINE HELM Hi, Maria, how was your week? 

00:21:05
MARIA My week was okay. It's a bit tiring but pushed through. I'm doing all right. 

00:21:10
KATHERINE HELM Okay. You know, we've been working on a couple of things. I was wondering how you been doing, especially this week because this was gonna be a big kind of discussion with your parents. 

00:21:25
MARIA Yeah. I'm… I'm feeling pretty… pretty stressed about that. Umm… I've been wanting to let them know that my boyfriend and I have made a decision that we are uh… moving in together. 

00:21:35
KATHERINE HELM Okay. 

00:21:40
MARIA Umm… And they're not… Yeah. I already know they're not gonna be okay with it. Umm… Because to them, you need to be married before you leave the house. And I just… I don't… I don't really agree. 

00:21:50
KATHERINE HELM Right. You know, and we've…we've been sort of talking about how giving your cultural background, you know, sort of marriage is a value that your parents really not only hold dear but you're supposed to do things in a different order, umm… and how conflicted you've been, because obviously you want to please your parents on one hand. But on the other hand, you know, this is a step that you're… you're sort of ready to make. So where are we with this? 

00:22:20
MARIA I… I know I'm gonna take the step. 

00:22:25
KATHERINE HELM Okay. 

00:22:25
MARIA And I'm going to take it but I think I'm just… I'm just nervous about the whole thing. Umm… 

00:22:35
KATHERINE HELM Talk to me a little bit about being nervous. 

00:22:40
MARIA Yeah. Like, how is this gonna affect my relationship with my parents? You know, are they gonna… I don't think they would, you know, disown me or anything like that but I feel like, maybe there will be some resentment. That's where my nervousness is. 

00:22:55
KATHERINE HELM Mm-hmm… So, you know, even though you sort of definitive you're really upset. No, we're… we're doing this. 

00:23:00
MARIA Yes. 

00:23:05
KATHERINE HELM I'm ready. You know, given sort of your appreciation for all your parents have been through. I mean, given, you know, kind of the values they raised you with. You know, you really feel like this… this is gonna be tough. 

00:23:15
MARIA Yeah, it is gonna be tough and I… I do feel some guilt. 

00:23:20
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

00:23:20
MARIA I think there's some guilt there. Umm… 

00:23:25
KATHERINE HELM Talk to me a little bit about the guilt. 

00:23:30
MARIA Guilt in that… My parents have sacrificed a lot for me to be where I am today. And for me to not follow the rules or go against their values kind of feels like, I'm not being appreciative of everything they've done for me. That's I think, that's where the guilt comes from. 

00:23:55
KATHERINE HELM Right. So do you in some ways feel like, this is sort of a slab in their face? 

00:24:00
MARIA Yes. 

00:24:00
KATHERINE HELM Yes? 

00:24:05
MARIA Yes. And I would never slap my parents in their face. 

00:24:05
KATHERINE HELM Never. Right. And so, you know, given, you know, everything that they've sacrificed and you know they're not comfortable with this. 

00:24:15
MARIA Right. 

00:24:15
KATHERINE HELM This is really, really difficult. 

00:24:15
MARIA Yeah. 

00:24:15
KATHERINE HELM But it's also something that you're pretty determined to do. 

00:24:20
MARIA Yes. So that's… that's where I'm torn. It's like, I know this is the right step for me, for my relationship. Umm… I don't feel like I need to be married to have that commitment, but it would also mean not respecting my parents and valuing. 

00:24:40
KATHERINE HELM Right. And, you know in past sessions we've talked a lot about sort of even getting to this point where, before you know, you really weren't comfortable kind of with the idea of moving with one of your boyfriend. And now you're saying, you know, I'm… I want to do this, even though in some ways I'm in the middle of a values conflict, this is something that I'm okay with, but I know this is like a slap in my parents face and as you said you've never slept your parents. 

00:25:10
MARIA No, never. Yeah, it's taken me a long time to get here. 

00:25:10
KATHERINE HELM It has. Can you… can you talk a little bit about the journey of getting here? 

00:25:15
MARIA Yeah. Well, I mean, my… my older sister moved out with her boyfriend without getting married. 

00:25:25
KATHERINE HELM Okay. 

00:25:25
MARIA And I saw my parents response to her. 

00:25:30
KATHERINE HELM And that was? 

00:25:30
MARIA They felt betrayed. 

00:25:30
KATHERINE HELM Okay. 

00:25:35
MARIA They felt hurt by her decision and that's what for a long time kept me from… 

00:25:40
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

00:25:40
MARIA Even exploring the idea. 

00:25:40
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. Because in some ways, you've always been the good child. 

00:25:45
MARIA Yes. 

00:25:45
KATHERINE HELM And then, you know, sort of, she took the role of the bad child and now you sort of have to give up that role. 

00:25:50
MARIA Yeah. 

00:25:50
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

00:25:55
MARIA Yeah, I don't want to be the bad child. 

00:25:55
KATHERINE HELM No, you don't want to be the bad child. 

00:25:55
MARIA I don't want to be the bad child. Yeah. So I think, you know, watching my sister go through that experience was kind of like, "Oh, I don't want to do it." And… But then kind of, you know, realizing what my relationship is, we've been dating for a while, I feel like the commitment is there. 

00:26:15
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:26:20
MARIA I feel like we both, you know, we need our space, you know, for ourselves. 

00:26:25
KATHERINE HELM You may sort of separate from your parents and then together with your boyfriend. 

00:26:25
MARIA Yes. 

00:26:25
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:26:30
MARIA Because, you know, if we want to just chill, hangout, it has to be at of our families homes. And… and there are certain boundaries. 

00:26:40
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:26:40
MARIA But I can't cross at my parent's home. 

00:26:40
KATHERINE HELM Right. 

00:26:45
MARIA Umm… And my parents are very strict about that. Even the way we sit next to each other, you know, so I just uh… Yeah. 

00:26:50
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. You know, even in past sessions we've talked to you sort of sick of having your relationship managed… 

00:27:00
MARIA Yes. 

00:27:00
KATHERINE HELM …by your parents. 

00:27:00
MARIA Yes. 

00:27:00
KATHERINE HELM So all that's led you to sort of definitively say. Now this is the right move for me. 

00:27:05
MARIA It is. It is. I feel like the more that we talk about it, the more I'm like yes. 

00:27:10
KATHERINE HELM Well, I can tell on your face. So you're saying no, this is happening. 

00:27:15
MARIA Yes. 

00:27:15
KATHERINE HELM Right. I don't, you know, I… You have some sort of grief about the pain your parents will go through, that this is not a decision they agree but you're not really wavering on this decision. 

00:27:25
MARIA I'm not. 

00:27:25
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

00:27:30
MARIA But it's the feeling of like, iciness of how are they gonna react. And is there a way that I can, you know, better manage the way I approach them. 

00:27:40
KATHERINE HELM Sure. 

00:27:45
MARIA Umm… Cuz I don't think my sister did a very good job. 

00:27:45
KATHERINE HELM Right. 

00:27:45
MARIA My sister just like, you know… Hey, you know, next week I'm moving out. So they were kind of like, what? 

00:27:55
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

00:27:55
MARIA Umm… 

00:27:55
KATHERINE HELM And you are months away from doing this? 

00:28:00
MARIA I am months away. 

00:28:00
KATHERINE HELM But you've… you're sort of anticipating how this will go. So… 

00:28:00
MARIA Yes. 

00:28:05
KATHERINE HELM For a while it took you a long time to get to this place of definitively deciding I'm doing this. 

00:28:05
MARIA Yeah. 

00:28:10
KATHERINE HELM And now you're sort of in the process of figuring out the best way to approach your parents. 

00:28:15
MARIA Yes. So the decision has been made. Now it's like how… how do I do this and how can I manage these feelings that I'm having, of like, you know… 

00:28:25
KATHERINE HELM Can you say a little more about the feelings? 

00:28:25
MARIA Just the feeling, I'm feeling guilty like, this is… this is not something I'm supposed to be doing. Almost feels like… I don't know. Like something, like when you're little, that you definitely… You're not supposed to do. Like, jumping on the bed or like, this is not okay, don't do this. 

00:28:45
KATHERINE HELM So again, this is kind of like, you don't want to be the bad child? 

00:28:45
MARIA Yes. 

00:28:50
KATHERINE HELM Your sister was, had that kind of role and you have always been the good child. Now this would kind of go into the realm of the dark side of being the bad child. Don't jump on the bed. You don't move in with your boyfriend, you have to be married. 

00:29:00
MARIA Yeah. 

00:29:00
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

00:29:00
MARIA And I think for so long I don't jump on the bed. 

00:29:05
KATHERINE HELM And you're about to jump on the bed? 

00:29:05
MARIA Yeah. 

00:29:05
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

00:29:10
MARIA So, oh… 

00:29:10
KATHERINE HELM What support do you think in here we can do around that for you? We've done a lot of work to get you here. We've done a really good job of clarifying for yourself what you really want. You know, in our sort of sessions going forwards, you know, this isn't a discussion you're gonna have tomorrow with them. 

00:29:25
MARIA No. Oh, God. 

00:29:30
KATHERINE HELM No. You know, I can almost feel kind of you're dread. 

00:29:30
MARIA No. 

00:29:35
KATHERINE HELM What support in here can we sort of provide you, so that you can feel good about that conversation? As good as you can feel. 

00:29:40
MARIA I know. Right. But I think that's part of it. It's like… I don't know if I'll ever be totally comfortable in the conversation. 

00:29:50
KATHERINE HELM Sure. Sure. I don't think confrontations are usually very comfortable. 

00:29:50
MARIA No. 

00:29:50
KATHERINE HELM It that helps at all. 

00:29:55
MARIA Definitely not. I'm not good at confrontation. So umm… I don't know. Umm… What would be helpful? 

00:30:05
[sil.] 

00:30:10
MARIA Uh… I think this is helpful. I think hearing myself say these words. 

00:30:15
KATHERINE HELM Yes. You know, and if it… if it helps you, your face when you said, I am doing this, is the clearest I've ever seated in all of our sessions together. 

00:30:25
MARIA Yeah. I…I feel good saying that. 

00:30:30
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. And from… from… You know, we've moved from you're deciding to do it, to definitively saying you're doing it. 

00:30:30
MARIA Yeah. 

00:30:35
KATHERINE HELM So maybe we'll sort of continue to work together on what this conversation might look like. 

00:30:40
MARIA Yeah. Yeah, that works. 

00:30:40
KATHERINE HELM Okay. So I will see you next week. 

00:30:45
MARIA Alrighty. It sounds good. 

00:30:50
DEBRIEFING OF SKILL NUMBER ONE: 

00:30:50
Working Through 

00:30:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is this a good example of working through? 

00:30:55
KATHERINE HELM I think it is a good example of working through. Umm… She really did a very nice job, of kind of really exploring where she was before. Like with her boyfriend she wasn't ready to move in with him. 

00:31:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

00:31:10
KATHERINE HELM And then I remember at one point in our session, she looked at me and says, no, I'm ready to make this decision. 

00:31:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, that's… that's a pretty pivotal moment. Yeah. 

00:31:15
KATHERINE HELM Yes. And just now she's sort of struggling with the after effects of, kind of, how will I tell my parents? And kind of… You know, will they view me as the bad child? What comes next? But the idea that she is where she is, that she's firm about this decision allows us to kind of move forward in our work together. 

00:31:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So again like that, because she's pretty… pretty definitive with that decision is kind of made and it sounds like, in previous work you've kind of, maybe work with her to get to that point, of actually solidifying that… that choice. 

00:31:45
KATHERINE HELM Yes. Yes. Exactly met. 

00:31:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So what does this kind of teaching the client then? What does the client kind of gaining? 

00:31:55
KATHERINE HELM Well, in some ways I would say you're kind of solidifying treatment gains or… or counseling gains of what's come before. And it… it really is a collaborative process between you and the client. It really wouldn't work if I told Maria. Look, this is what you should do. 

00:32:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:32:10
KATHERINE HELM Umm… She really worked through kind of initially, this is something I want to do but I'm not ready yet, to, this is something I am going to do. Her language changed. The look on her face changed. And now we can deal with the other part which means, how this has changed my relationship with my parents. How does this change how they view me, et cetera. 

00:32:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So in some ways it sounds like, there's almost like a sequencing that happens. So this is kind of, part of that first sequence, which is okay, the choice has to made and now I'm going to do this. So that, with the next stage you're working through with her, maybe be competitive, now working through that piece with her parents. Like, how she gonna maybe tell them. But even maybe the telling isn't a issue, how she's gonna deal with emotional consequences with that. 

00:32:50
KATHERINE HELM That's right. Exactly. 

00:32:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:32:50
KATHERINE HELM Exactly. And so in some ways it's kind of either continued from sort of an older place of our work or really opened up kind of a new area. 

00:33:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:33:00
KATHERINE HELM She kind of really asserting herself as an adult here. 

00:33:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And this is kind of skill and intervention that… that it's kind of ongoing in this approach. 

00:33:10
KATHERINE HELM Yes. Yes. It really is. And it… it kind of kind of represents a place in the work, umm… that… that shows some progression. 

00:33:20
PSYCHODYNAMIC THERAPY 

00:33:20
SKILL NUMBER TWO: 

00:33:20
FREE ASSOCIATION 

00:33:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Skill number two, free association. 

00:33:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What is free association and why is it important from a psychodynamic perspective? 

00:33:30
KATHERINE HELM So free association, the way umm… it's used today is kind of different than what was originally conceptualized through psychoanalytic theory but it was used as a technique to get at sort of a client's deeper unconscious. 

00:33:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:33:45
KATHERINE HELM Today, umm… in the way that I'm going to use it with Maria is to kind of really allow her, I sort of have her. I say a word or phrase and then she begins to sort of react to that and say the first things that come to mind. So she can hear themes out loud of what she's thinking about feeling when she thinks about the traditional graduate student. 

00:34:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So what you're trying to do in this clip, it sounds like is to maybe free her up a little bit umm… to get out maybe kind of what she's really experiencing? 

00:34:20
KATHERINE HELM Yes. Umm… She really uh… struggles with this idea that she belongs in graduate school. She wants to know right or she really feels like, I don't know if I've earned the right to be here. 

00:34:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:34:30
KATHERINE HELM Umm… And, you know, through our work together, I was sort of thinking, I wonder what this is about for her. I wonder if this has anything to do with the fact that she's first-generation college and graduate student and she's a woman of color. If this is really influencing her conceptualization or understanding of who earns the right to be in graduate school. 

00:34:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:34:50
KATHERINE HELM So I used free association with her, uh… to kind of really have her explore that. 

00:34:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. You know, in the clip there's a moment where you say, let's try this. Umm… 

00:34:55
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:35:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So what should we paying… paying attention to when we watch this clip? 

00:35:00
KATHERINE HELM One of the things to kind of pay attention to is, you know, I had her actually do it twice. 

00:35:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Okay. 

00:35:10
KATHERINE HELM So the first time I had her do it, she sort of talked about it from out there. You know, sort of this idea of who a graduate student is. A student, what's a good student, a deep thinker et cetera. Then the second time I thought, this isn't really kind of getting at what I think she might be feeling. 

00:35:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:35:25
KATHERINE HELM I had her do it again and then it became more personal for her. 

00:35:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So we should watch how you make that distinction. 

00:35:30
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:35:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. And so go a little bit deeper. 

00:35:35
KATHERINE HELM Yes. Yes. Exactly. 

00:35:40
EXAMPLE OF SKILL NUMBER TWO: 

00:35:40
Free Association 

00:35:45
KATHERINE HELM Hi, Maria. 

00:35:45
MARIA Hi. 

00:35:45
KATHERINE HELM How are things going? 

00:35:50
MARIA Uh… I think this past week has been a bit difficult. 

00:35:50
KATHERINE HELM Tell me. 

00:35:55
MARIA Umm… I've talked about it a little bit in here about how I have a lot of self-doubt sometimes in my graduate program and not really feeling like…like questioning, "Should I be here? Have I… Have I earned the…the right to be here? Which as I say, it sounds crazy. But in the moment I definitely feel that way. 

00:36:20
KATHERINE HELM So did something happened specifically this week to kind of bring more of these feelings out? 

00:36:25
MARIA Yeah, we were having umm… We're having a presentation in class and, umm…. it wasn't my presentation. So I was just sitting there watching. 

00:36:35
KATHERINE HELM Sure. 

00:36:40
MARIA And, umm… the professor I think asked for some… some feedback about, you know, what did you think. And I thought I had a great, you know, answer. 

00:36:45
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

00:36:50
MARIA Great, you know, great feedback. I was like, oh, yeah. I noticed that, you know, blah, blah, blah. And then she… The professor said, "Yeah, I don't think that's what was happening." And in my mind I'm just like, "Oh, but I was so sure." 

00:37:05
KATHERINE HELM And when the professor said that… that felt like what for you? 

00:37:10
MARIA Let me…let me go back to that moment and think. It just… it felt like self-doubt. I felt uncomfortable. 

00:37:20
KATHERINE HELM You looked deflated. 

00:37:20
MARIA Yeah. 

00:37:20
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

00:37:25
MARIA Yeah, because I really… I really thought I was contributing. 

00:37:25
KATHERINE HELM Mm-hmm… 

00:37:30
MARIA You know, in that moment it was kind of like, no, I'm not. 

00:37:35
KATHERINE HELM Mm-hmm…You know, and it…it strikes me sort of, even not only the look on your face but sort of the idea of earning the right to be a graduate student. 

00:37:45
MARIA Yeah. Because I think it in my mind Graduate School is about you not just learning, it's also about you're contributing, creating knowledge. And I feel like in that moment, I didn't, I didn't fulfill that role. 

00:38:05
KATHERINE HELM Would you be willing to try something? 

00:38:05
MARIA Sure. 

00:38:10
KATHERINE HELM Okay. Umm… I'm gonna sort of say… 

00:38:15
MARIA Okay. 

00:38:15
KATHERINE HELM A phrase. 

00:38:15
MARIA Sure. 

00:38:15
KATHERINE HELM And will you kind of, umm… sort of without stopping yourself talk about the first things that come to your mind. 

00:38:25
MARIA Okay. So like one word or just… 

00:38:25
KATHERINE HELM Whatever comes to your mind. 

00:38:25
MARIA Whatever comes to mind. 

00:38:25
KATHERINE HELM Try not to stop yourself or censor yourself. 

00:38:30
MARIA Oh, boy. Okay 

00:38:30
KATHERINE HELM Okay? Right. And so… And I want to frame this. I want us to kind of go back to that classroom. 

00:38:35
MARAI Okay. 

00:38:35
KATHERINE HELM Right. 

00:38:35
MARIA Okay. 

00:38:40
KATHERINE HELM Umm… And I'm gonna say, so here we go. Umm… Graduate student? 

00:38:45
MARIA Graduate student? Uh… I can already feel myself filtering. Okay graduate student. Graduate student, creator of knowledge, student, umm… someone… someone who needs a certain level, not everyone's a graduate student. Graduate student is like much more than just a student. 

00:39:10
KATHERINE HELM Keep going. 

00:39:15
MARIA Okay. And graduate student… Graduate student is someone who's responsible. Someone who has a passion for learning. Umm… Graduate student is someone who… 

00:39:30
[sil.] 

00:39:40
MARIA Umm… I think, I… Yeah, I think that's kind of what's coming up. 

00:39:45
KATHERINE HELM We'll… We'll stop there for a second. 

00:39:45
MARIA Okay. 

00:39:45
KATHERINE HELM Because I can sort of visually see you in some way censoring yourself. 

00:39:45
MARIA Yes. 

00:39:50
KATHERINE HELM Yes. So can…can we try it again? But this time, when you picture. Can you visualize a graduate student for me. sort of your ideal graduate student maybe? 

00:40:00
MARIA Okay. 

00:40:00
KATHERINE HELM And then I want you to try to free associate again, where you don't stop yourself. So can you sort of visualize and picture the ideal graduate student? 

00:40:10
MARIA Oh, man. 

00:40:10
KATHERINE HELM Go. 

00:40:10
MARIA Yeah. Graduate student, I'm sitting here and I'm like, what does a graduate student look like? A graduate student looks like someone who umm… maybe older. Umm… Male. For some reason the male image came up. Umm… White, I see white. Umm… Glasses, for some reason, glasses. Umm… Yeah, I see someone kind of sitting there studying for long hours of time, writing a lot, umm… lots of coffee, that's… that's what I see when I think graduate student. 

00:40:55
KATHERINE HELM Okay. So we sort of did that twice. 

00:40:55
MARIA Yeah. 

00:41:00
KATHERINE HELM What was different from the first time you did it, from the second time you did it? 

00:41:05
MARIA I think having to visualize… Like actually trying to see a graduate student versus, umm… I think the first time it was more like… I don't know. I didn't visualize anybody specific. I think that's what was different. 

00:41:20
KATHERINE HELM Can you remember some of the things that you said, the first time versus the second Time? There's a… There's a difference. 

00:41:30
MARIA Yeah, I'm sure there's a difference. Umm… I think I was describing more the… the traits, not… not, you know, what… what a, that graduate student looks like but more or like some of the values that I feel like a graduate student holds. So I said, passion for knowledge I think was one of the things I said and responsible maybe. I can't remember. 

00:41:50
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. Someone who contributes to knowledge. 

00:41:55
MARIA Yes. 

00:41:55
KATHERINE HELM And then the second time? 

00:41:55
MARIA Second time was very much, umm… a white male wearing glasses, drinking coffee, and studied a lot. 

00:42:05
KATHERINE HELM What do you make of that? 

00:42:10
MARIA There's a disconnect. 

00:42:10
KATHERINE HELM Tell me. 

00:42:15
MARIA There's a disconnect in that. I feel like maybe I possess some of the traits from that first list. 

00:42:25
KATHERINE HELM Like which one didn't you possess? 

00:42:25
MARIA I don't know. Maybe all of them. 

00:42:30
KATHERINE HELM I think so. 

00:42:30
MARIA Yeah. 

00:42:30
KATHERINE HELM And then the second time? 

00:42:30
MARIA Yeah, I can't relate to that, other than the coffee maybe. 

00:42:35
KATHERINE HELM Okay, and the glasses? 

00:42:35
MARIA And the glasses. 

00:42:35
KATHERINE HELM And the glasses. That's right. 

00:42:40
MARIA Yeah. 

00:42:40
KATHERINE HELM So that there were just two traits? 

00:42:40
MARIA Yes. 

00:42:40
KATHERINE HELM Which were? 

00:42:45
MARIA White and male. 

00:42:45
KATHERINE HELM Right. 

00:42:45
MARIA And I'm not. 

00:42:45
KATHERINE HELM Right. 

00:42:45
MARIA Yeah. 

00:42:50
KATHERINE HELM So what do you do with that? 

00:42:50
MARIA I don't know. 

00:42:50
KATHERINE HELM So the first time and the second time you're all of those things. 

00:42:55
MARIA Yeah. 

00:43:00
KATHERINE HELM Except being white and male. 

00:43:00
MARIA Yeah. 

00:43:00
KATHERINE HELM And that was it. 

00:43:00
MARIA Yeah. 

00:43:05
KATHERINE HELM So those are the only two ways you are not an ideal graduate student? 

00:43:10
MARIA Yeah, and I have absolutely no control over that. 

00:43:10
KATHERINE HELM Right. 

00:43:10
MARIA Yeah. 

00:43:15
KATHERINE HELM So what do you… What is it that you think that you're struggling with in terms of sitting in that classroom and feeling like you don't belong there? 

00:43:30
MARIA Yeah, I think maybe just, you know, being a person of color. Umm… I didn't grow up with the idea of graduate school or college, I don't think. Umm… So it feels very new to me. And some of the environments that I've been have been predominantly white. Umm… 

00:43:55
KATHERINE HELM What I do find interesting is somehow, you know, from what you're suggesting that, those students who are ideal… I mean, and you're ideal in those ways except for being white male, have earned the right to be there and yet you have not. 

00:44:10
MARIA I know it sounds silly when you say like that. 

00:44:10
KATHERINE HELM Well, I wonder if it's not silly but I wonder if that's sort of how you feel or maybe your first response to things. 

00:44:15
MARIA I think so. 

00:44:15
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

00:44:20
MARIA I think unfiltered, that's what comes up first. 

00:44:20
KATHERINE HELM Yeah, and I think that's pretty powerful, Maria. But I do sort of what I highlight here, you were all of those things except these sort of minor demographic variables of being white and male. 

00:44:30
MARIA Right. Yeah. 

00:44:35
KATHERINE HELM What do you make of this? 

00:44:40
MARIA It makes sense. And I… I do you know, in the moment I may feel like, "What am I doing here?" But, like if I… if I take a step back and I really think about it, I… I have worked pretty damn hard to be here. 

00:45:00
KATHERINE HELM And now doing well. 

00:45:00
MARIA Yeah. 

00:45:00
KATHERINE HELM Mm-hmm. 

00:45:05
MARIA And… Yeah, no ones, you know, hasn't been like, you know, someone gifted me this. Like, here you go. Like, I have, had to work hard for this. 

00:45:10
KATHERINE HELM So in many ways you have earned the right based on your past academic performance as an undergraduate to sit in that classroom with everybody else? 

00:45:20
MARIA Yes. 

00:45:20
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. You know, sort of the ironic thing is, you are graduate student in a critical Mental Health Program. 

00:45:25
MARIA Yeah. 

00:45:30
KATHERINE HELM How many white males are in your program? 

00:45:30
MARIA Not that many. 

00:45:35
KATHERINE HELM Not that many. 

00:45:35
MARIA Now like… Now when I think about it, yeah, not that many. 

00:45:40
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:45:40
MARIA Uh… Interesting. 

00:45:45
DEBRIEFING OF SKILL NUMBER TWO: 

00:45:45
Free Association 

00:45:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is this a good example of Free Association? 

00:45:55
KATHERINE HELM I think it is a good example of Free Association, especially because she did it twice and the content was different. 

00:46:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there's a… there's a very distinct difference between the first time and the second time. 

00:46:05
KATHERINE HELM Yeah, there is. And which I think the second time became more meaningful for her and I'm not sure if we would have been able to get that after the first time with free association. 

00:46:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. In the beginning it sounds like she is talking about this discomfort she's having. 

00:46:20
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:46:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Umm… It's very, very intellectualized in many ways. And though she's feeling, gets disconnected from her. 

00:46:25
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:46:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And then you made this choice you said, "Let's try this intervention?" What led you to kind of make that choice to kind of try this? 

00:46:35
KATHERINE HELM I think I made that choice because she was all the things she said the first time. 

00:46:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:46:40
KATHERINE HELM But, and I thought well but she still doesn't feel like she deserves to be in graduate school. What else is there? I just felt like she was holding back, which clients frequently do if you do this one time. 

00:46:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. And then there's that moment in which, uh…, you know, you do it the first time and then you kind of, say, let's try this again. So tell me about that… that let's try that again. 

00:47:05
KATHERINE HELM So I think that sometimes, you know, developing counselors are too quick to abandon something. Like, well, that didn't work the first time. 

00:47:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:47:10
KATHERINE HELM But most of us, if we're dealing with something deeply personal, emotional, need multiple times to really explore something. So you can't sort of be afraid of being shut down by the client or just assuming that you're gonna explore it one time and then it's gone. I… I felt in that session, she was holding back the first time and I wanted just to try it again. And so we took a risk and went ahead and did it and it served more fruitful, but she needed both time, one and time two for her really come up with this understanding that this was an issue for her about, sort of being a woman of color in a graduate program. 

00:47:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it's something about, I think almost, you know, like in a way you had some insight that you thought that this could be effective, right? And then, you know, and she took one dig and it was fruitless and some people might say, okay, well, good try. And you say, "Well, let's just try again and see. We get a little deeper this time." And there were some insight at the end. 

00:48:10
KATHERINE HELM Yes. So in some way she came away with this idea that, wait, I do belong in graduate school. And what sort of holding me back is this idea that, you know, I'm a woman of color and not many people look like me in the… in my graduate program. The kind of funny thing was, you know, not many people look like her, ideal graduate students, which has a white male into graduate program either. That's right. That's right. 

00:48:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. That insight was, would look pretty profound was, this is what I think grad students look like. And, oh, my gosh, there aren't any of those around me. 

00:48:40
KATHERINE HELM Right. 

00:48:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So… so maybe it's me. 

00:48:40
KATHERINE HELM Right. Maybe I am the ideal graduate student, if there is such a thing. 

00:48:50
PSYCHODYNAMIC THERAPY 

00:48:50
Skill Number Three:Interpretation 

00:48:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Skill Number Three:Interpretation. What is interpretation? What is interpretation and why is it important to address? 

00:48:55
KATHERINE HELM So interpretation is one of the hallmarks of psychodynamic theory. Umm… It really sort of takes bits of information, kind of puts them together in a new understanding, umm… for the client. Interpretations work best though. When you've been working with a client for a little while and they either are about to come to their own understanding or have already come to that understanding and then you build upon it. 

00:49:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And there's an aspect of you being involved with this though. I think sometimes early students think, I'm being too directive, I can't do this. But you're being directive in which you're offering your own insight and observations? 

00:49:35
KATHERINE HELM That's right. And in some ways I think that is what we are trained to do. You just… You know, you offer an interpretation for a client to look deeper at an issue or an emotion, behavior, et cetera. But the client can say, that doesn't really work or maybe right. So interpretations I guess are themselves open to interpretation but they should be collaborative. 

00:49:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. (inaudible) that what I wonder a couple of times. You know, I wonder if, as a way it kind of offered as a… as that the client can take or not take and see how it fits of it. 

00:50:05
KATHERINE HELM That's right. 

00:50:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:50:10
KATHERINE HELM That's right. And you know… So it's okay I think with interpretation to… to be wrong for the counselor. You can't be so concerned about getting it right. You have to get close enough that the client thinks more deeply about something and it should be a skill used sort of sparingly. 

00:50:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. And it sounds like this is awesome on those ongoing kind of interventions that you would use, that would minimize compliment things like working through. Right? 

00:50:35
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:50:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So this working through is…is components of… of interpretation… 

00:50:40
KATHERINE HELM Yes. Yeah. And sort of to your point, you know, working through is housed within the relationship between the counselor and the client, will so as interpretation. You have to know your client well enough to understand the context in which they exist. You have to really have a solid understanding of who they are, what motivates them to do a good interpretation. 

00:50:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. All right. So what should we'll be paying attention to in this clip? 

00:51:00
KATHERINE HELM So in this clip, you know, Maria is talking about her uh… boyfriend and being disappointed that he's not sort of taking more of a lead on, finding a full-time job. She's worried about finances. As, you know, they're getting ready to kind of move in together, which is causing her a lot of anxiety because she's moving out of her parent's home and they are not necessarily going to be happy about that. 

00:51:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

00:51:25
KATHERINE HELM Umm… And I used the skill of interpretation to really get her to understand that in some ways she might be unconsciously comparing her boyfriend to her father. 

00:51:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:51:40
KATHERINE HELM He's sort of the father's strong role in her family and yet she chose a man very different from her father. And so we talked about, umm… how this might be positioning her relationship and how she might deal with that conflict. 

00:51:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. So it sounds like, and maybe in that moment of, kind of panic or that moment of some internal conflict, uh… which she goes back to, as maybe looking for more like a father figure. 

00:52:00
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. Yes, and… 

00:52:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Unconsciously. 

00:52:05
KATHERINE HELM Exactly. And it… it makes sense because she's getting ready to kind of move out on her own with her romantic partner. And sometimes we pull for our romantic partners to take care of us in a similar way that a parent might. 

00:52:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. Good. Good. 

00:52:20
EXAMPLE OF SKILL NUMBER THREE: 

00:52:20
Interpretation 

00:52:25
MARIA So this past week I had kind of a, not kind of, I had an argument. 

00:52:30
KATHERINE HELM Okay. 

00:52:30
MARIA With uh… my boyfriend. 

00:52:30
KATHERINE HELM Okay. 

00:52:35
MARIA So we're now, we're… we're planning things out. We want to make sure that we're ready to… to move out. And… and I just find myself getting so frustrated at times with him, because I feel like he should be doing things a certain way. Like, if… if I was in this position, I know exactly what I would do and how I would do it. And so I find myself getting frustrated when he doesn't, when he doesn't do it. 

00:53:00
KATHERINE HELM Tell me a little bit more about the… the argument you had? 

00:53:05
MARIA Yeah. So umm… so we're looking at finances, right? So I'm going, you know… It's not easy for me. It wasn't easy for me to decide to move out. Okay? I'm already going against what my parents want. So I want to make sure that we're financially responsible through this transition. Umm… I know how much I can contribute financially, umm… but he has, you know, he has a job, it's part time, umm… it's kind of flaky, sometimes they just cancel his hours. It has a good pay but, you know, I'm feeling nervous. I'm feeling like, what if we do make this decision, now we have to pay rent, now all our expenses we have to take care of. So I feel like, you know, you have a part-time job, you could totally use some of that time to maybe apply for another job and…and he doesn't. 

00:54:00
KATHERINE HELM It sounds like he's been letting you down? 

00:54:00
MARIA Yeah, because I feel like he could be doing more. 

00:54:05
KATHERINE HELM Like he's not doing enough to sort of contribute to your vision of sort of leaving your parents homes and moving in together? 

00:54:15
MARIA Right. Yeah, I don't feel like. You know, if we're in the same place, when it is time to move out I wouldn't feel comfortable moving out because I can't… You know, I… I can only work part-time right now. I can't contribute financially that much. 

00:54:35
KATHERINE HELM Maria, can you explain that a little bit more, sort of the idea of you know, if you said, if he was in a, this place right now with this half, part-time job that he has, you're not comfortable moving out, I'm a little confused? 

00:54:45
MARIA Umm… Yeah. Because I know we won't be able to afford it. 

00:54:50
KATHERINE HELM Okay. 

00:54:50
MARIA If, you know, he continues with this part-time job, that sometimes flakes on the hours. Umm… He… he teaches. So sometimes I'll cancel one of his classes and he won't get paid, umm… like he usually would. 

00:55:05
KATHERINE HELM You're pretty frustrated. 

00:55:05
MARIA Yeah, I am pretty frustrated. And I think that argument, that frustration came out. 

00:55:10
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. And what kinds of things were said? 

00:55:15
MARIA I didn't say… But he definitely understood that I'm feeling disappointed. And umm… 

00:55:25
KATHERINE HELM You horn back here, what… what did you say? 

00:55:30
MARIA I feel like he's letting me down. Like… I… I… I expect him to do more and he's not doing more. Umm… And if it was up to me, like, you know, I could totally do that. I could totally fill out job applications, I could… You know, but it's not. I can't do that. 

00:55:50
KATHERINE HELM So on the one hand you're sort of struggling with this… this idea that he's not doing enough and if it were you, you'd kind of jump right in there and… and do it. 

00:55:55
MARIA Right. Right. 

00:56:00
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

00:56:00
MARIA And the argument kind of started with me, like, trying to, trying to do that. You know, like sending him, you know, open job postings. I feel like I'm starting to do that. 

00:56:10
KATHERINE HELM And it didn't go well? 

00:56:10
MARIA And it didn't go well. 

00:56:15
KATHERINE HELM You know, I… I wonder who you might be comparing him to in your mind? 

00:56:20
MARIA Umm… I think, probably my dad. 

00:56:25
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. Talk a little bit about… about your dad and his role in your family. 

00:56:35
MARIA My dad has always been the provider. We've been very lucky. I think that he's been able to provide for the entire family to where my mom could stay home and be with us. Umm… So I feel like… I'm kind of expecting my boyfriend to live up to that. 

00:56:55
KATHERINE HELM And disappointed when he doesn't? 

00:56:55
MARIA And disappointed, yeah. 

00:57:00
KATHERINE HELM Yeah, you know, and that's causing some friction. And, you know, we've talked a lot before about your father sort of strong role in the family, how they sort of came over from Mexico and had to work very hard, you know, and sort of even the role of machismo, both sort of, a lot of the positives with it, in terms of sort of being grounded in the family and protecting and taking care of one's family, providing for one's family, valuing family. 

00:57:20
MARIA Yeah. 

00:57:25
KATHERINE HELM And sort of some of the negatives that, you know, that can kind of come with that as well. Umm… Do you think that you are actively comparing your father's role, which is well-established, you know, to your boyfriend, who was sort of, you know, learning his role with you as you guys move out together? 

00:57:45
MARIA Yeah. You know, I don't think consciously but now that I'm sitting here, it's like, yes, it makes sense. And we've had conversations before because there are, like, you know, the value of machismo… I like the positives, I hate the negatives. So we've had conversations, my boyfriend and I, about how moving forward in our relationship, like, I don't want to move into a patriarchal type of relationship but yet I find myself still having this expectations of him. 

00:58:20
KATHERINE HELM Yeah, and in some ways pulling for that, like, here are these job applications, you need to be doing this because it's your job to provide. 

00:58:25
MARIA Yeah. Yeah. 

00:58:30
KATHERINE HELM You're in a quandary. 

00:58:30
MARIA I am. 

00:58:30
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

00:58:30
MARIA Because part of me is like… I shouldn't expect him to contribute more than I can contribute, because I like the idea of us having, you know, kind of equality in our relationship but at the same time, I find myself getting really frustrated when he's not contributing more than I am. 

00:58:50
KATHERINE HELM And we've also talked about some of the, you know, negatives of your relationship with your dad. He's sort of more autocratic, you know, and your boyfriend's not like that. So he is not in some ways, you know, umm… sort of this stern figure, this protective figure which you value your dad for and also don't value all the time, as it sort of prevents you from doing the things that you want to do. What do you do with that, now that you sort of have this insight? 

00:59:25
MARIA Yeah. Yeah, it's true because I feel… It feels a little bit unfair. 

00:59:30
KATHERINE HELM Say more about unfair. 

00:59:30
MARIA It feels unfair for me to pick and choose which aspects of my dad or, you know, the male role that I want him to be. Like I… I don't want my boyfriend to be the person that's like, you don't do this, you can't do this, this is how it needs to be done. But at the same time, I expect him to be the provider and the protector. Umm… And that doesn't seem fair. 

01:00:05
KATHERINE HELM What are you gonna do with this insight, now that you sort of brought it out? 

01:00:15
MARIA Yeah. I feel like I need to communicate where I am, because I don't. 

01:00:20
KATHERINE HELM Which is where? 

01:00:20
MARIA I don't communicate. You know, like the frustration I feel that comes out and he doesn't really know what's going on. So as I'm sitting here I'm thinking about someone who's like frustrated in him or someone who's frustrated at me and I haven't, you know, I don't really know what's going on. 

01:00:40
KATHERINE HELM Do you think in some ways that, you know, some of this is about frustration for this role that he is not taking on? But I wonder if some of it's just kind of general anxiety about leaving your parent's house, how are we gonna make this work financially. I wonder if some of this is just sort of normal things that couples go through as they sort of leave the nest and build an adult life for themselves. 

01:01:05
MARIA Totally. 

01:01:05
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

01:01:05
MARIA I think it is a combination of both. I think… Yeah, a good chunk of my frustration comes with, you know, I'm…I'm going out on a limb here. You know, I'm…I'm stepping to some dangerous territory. I want to make sure that I can, you know, have you fighting beside me. I want to make sure that, you know, that we're gonna be okay. 

01:01:30
KATHERINE HELM So in the end it's really more about making sure, okay. 

01:01:30
MARIA Yeah. 

01:01:35
KATHERINE HELM Not about, right… And the role he plays is somewhat negotiable because there's some powerful things about him that you love, right, and then they're always frustrations with our partner that we don't. 

01:01:45
MARIA Right. 

01:01:45
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

01:01:50
MARIA Yeah. I think… I think that's… I think that's where I'm at. 

01:01:55
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. But I think recognizing sort of, this pool that you have, sort of this wanting him to be the strong protective male figure and yet also wanting a very egalitarian relationship, that tension will be there. 

01:02:05
MARIA Yeah. Yeah, because those two things are… 

01:02:10
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

01:02:10
MARIA You know, I don't know if they go well together. 

01:02:15
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

01:02:15
MARIA So… Yeah, I think… I think its good inside and recognizing that this is something that, you know, we're gonna have to learn to sort of navigate. 

01:02:25
KATHERINE HELM We are you? 

01:02:30
MARIA Umm… I want him to know. Yeah, I think myself. I think myself and learning to communicate where I'm going through it, to him. I think that's… that's probably what would help. 

01:02:45
KATHERINE HELM Okay. 

01:02:50
DEBRIEFING OF SKILL NUMBER THREE: 

01:02:50
Interpretation 

01:02:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Wow. Okay, so that was pretty interesting. Umm… Is that a good example of interpretation? 

01:03:00
KATHERINE HELM It is a good example of interpretation. And…and it's sort of… There were multiple interpretations, because you know, I… 

01:03:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot going on there. 

01:03:05
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. So I came up with one and she built upon that and sort of laughs at one point and says, "Yeah, I don't know if I can expect him to sort of do both things." 

01:03:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:03:15
KATHERINE HELM And we wrapped kind of, explored the role of her culture and the role of, her kind of becoming more of an adult. We wrapped sort of all of that and explored that in multiple interpretations and that's what you want. 

01:03:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:03:25
KATHERINE HELM You want a client to go, umm… Oh, that does make sense. And how else can I look more deeply at that? 

01:03:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It looked like she was having these moments in which she was gaining insight and saying, uh-huh… I didn't think of it that way, you know, and…and that she was really kind of, that why, was being answered through in many ways. 

01:03:45
KATHERINE HELM Yes. And when a counselor does an interpretation, you sort of look at your client. How are they receiving it? Does this sort of… Do they agree with this or they like, absolutely not? And so that's how you build upon the interpretation. You process with the client. What was it like for you to hear that? And, so we kept going with it because she was highly receptive to it. 

01:04:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. And then, again, there's that unconscious piece here in which, in a way she's pulled towards her boyfriend, he is, right? 

01:04:15
KATHERINE HELM Yes. Yes. 

01:04:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And also who he's not, right? So she's pulled towards him because he's not like her father many ways. 

01:04:20
KATHERINE HELM Right. 

01:04:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And yet in this crisis moment, you know, she's pulled kind of back towards her father because she wants security and…and protection. 

01:04:30
KATHERINE HELM Exactly and realizes that this puts sort of her relationship with him in a bit of a conflict. 

01:04:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. 

01:04:35
KATHERINE HELM And that, you know, I might have even challenge her a little bit because you said, well, we need to look at this. I said, well, do we need to look at this or do you need to look at this, because in some ways you're positioning him like that. 

01:04:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. So what… what might you expect to be the next step after this? So we… You know, at the end of that clip what… what would the next session look like or what might you do next with her on this? 

01:04:55
KATHERINE HELM Umm… That's a good question. And I might ask her, you know, so last week we sort of ended our session with this sort of profound interpretation of, you sort of expecting him to, in some ways be two people. 

01:05:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

01:05:10
KATHERINE HELM What did you do with that when you went home? How did that change? How you felt? How did that change? How you viewed sort of, what he's doing and who he is. And that's another way to sort of build on solidify that interpretation and see if it leads to behavioral change. So Maria herself has to do something with that if she wants to sort of have some relief about recognizing who her boyfriend is in her own right, in his own right, sorry. 

01:05:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So this is… I hear you say is like there's… there's insight but there's more than just inside, right? You know, and it's not uncommon that a client might to sit with that insight for a while but again you would follow up and kind of say, "Okay, so what's happening with this now?" 

01:05:50
KATHERINE HELM Exactly. 

01:05:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:05:50
KATHERINE HELM Exactly. 

01:05:55
PSYCHODYNAMIC THERAPY 

01:05:55
SKILL NUMBER TWO: 

01:05:55
Resistance 

01:05:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Skill number four:resistance. What is meant uh… by resistance from psychodynamic perspective? 

01:06:05
KATHERINE HELM Resistance is anything that kind of stops the forward progression of counseling or therapy. 

01:06:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. 

01:06:10
KATHERINE HELM Umm… So, you know, it… it means the work in some ways gets stuck. 

01:06:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So we've already talked about two kinds of skills, we've talked about kind of interpretation, we've talked about working through. In some ways you've talked about them as if, you know, these things kind of happen and the client accepts at all and this client is moving forward. But the reality is… is that that's not the reality. 

01:06:30
KATHERINE HELM Yes. And I think newer counselors sometime interpret resistance. They either sort of just say, okay, well, we're not gonna go there and stop or get frustrated with the resistance. And it can be frustrating but it's sort of a natural part of being a human being, to not let somebody sort of just do what they want. And so it should be really thought about as being, they're telling you something as a counselor. 

01:06:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:06:55
KATHERINE HELM It's meaningful and it always gives some important information about what is happening with the client. 

01:07:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So part of this it sounds like is… is to not… not pushback from the resistance button, so you're viewing that as an opportunity to learn something, to kind of lean into it, what's happening here, there's insight to be gained. 

01:07:15
KATHERINE HELM Exactly. Exactly. Because again, why is the client resistant? What is the kind of pushback here? What is it about? 

01:07:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So the important sounds like it comes from that insight around the resistance (inaudible). 

01:07:25
KATHERINE HELM Exactly. 

01:07:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So what should we be paying attention to in this clip in terms of what you're doing? 

01:07:30
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. So Maria and I are talking about… She's got a lot of anxiety around Graduate School, presenting test sort of all the tasks of graduate school. But, you know, in previous work with her, we had to explore that. You know, many graduate students have anxiety but this is spilling over and it's basically constant. It spills over into her relationships with her parents and her boyfriend and she wants to kind of continue just moving through it, but really it's… it's damaging to her. And she really is very reluctant to look at how damaging. She just kind of wants to muscle through it. 

01:08:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So when you kind of point that out, you know, uh… that this is kind of beyond normal, she kind of pushes back with just, this is just the way that it is, it's fine, you know, I can handle it. It's… 

01:08:15
KATHERINE HELM Yep. Yep. 

01:08:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:08:20
KATHERINE HELM Yep. And I think that's… that's pretty normal because, you know, we all want to think that we can handle everything. Yes. 

01:08:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. Right. 

01:08:25
EXAMPLE OF SKILL NUMBER FOUR: 

01:08:25
Resistance 

01:08:35
MARIA So uh… Yeah, I have this presentation this past week and I was just feeling sick to my stomach. 

01:08:40
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

01:08:45
MARIA Just, I…I hate going up in front of the class. And… and I'm so self-critical that I'm always like questioning myself. And I'm always wondering "What are they thinking about me in this moment?" Oh, my god, I said that totally wrong. Yeah. 

01:09:00
KATHERINE HELM This is, you know, impacting you a lot. 

01:09:00
MARIA It is. 

01:09:00
KATHERINE HELM I mean to the point where, you know, you're finding it really difficult to sit through class every time you have a presentation or a test or even a paper due. 

01:09:15
MARIA Yeah, but I'm, you know… I feel like it's just… it's just kind of part of the Graduate School experience. 

01:09:25
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. I… I definitely agree with that. Umm… You know, I remember myself really struggling with anxiety in graduate school because it is anxiety provoking. 

01:09:30
MARIA Yeah. Yeah. 

01:09:30
KATHERINE HELM Umm… But this seems to spill over into your relationships with your boyfriend and your family. 

01:09:35
MARIA Yeah. 

01:09:40
KATHERINE HELM We've talked about kind of different ways to sort of cope with anxiety. Have you tried any of them? 

01:09:45
MARIA Umm… Not… not really, no. Umm… 

01:09:50
KATHERINE HELM Well, what do you think it's kind of preventing you from trying different things to cope with your anxiety? Because at the… at the time it's happening, it kind of cripples you. You sort of get stuck in it. 

01:10:10
MARIA Yeah. I just… I don't know. I feel like… I'm just, you know, I'm used to it happening. Umm… Sometimes it goes away after a little bit. So… 

01:10:25
KATHERINE HELM Does it go away? 

01:10:30
MARIA Eventually. Like eventually. 

01:10:30
KATHERINE HELM So the sleep problems? 

01:10:35
MARIA Yeah. 

01:10:35
KATHERINE HELM The eating issues. The fights with your boyfriend… It goes away? 

01:10:45
[sil.] 

01:10:50
MARIA They haven't yet. 

01:10:50
KATHERINE HELM Even in here I notice you're tapping your fingers. 

01:10:55
MARIA Yeah, I'm uncomfortable. 

01:10:55
KATHERINE HELM Tell me what's uncomfortable? 

01:11:00
MARIA I'm uncomfortable hearing about all this stuff. 

01:11:05
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. What's coming up for you as we're talking about sort of being stuck in your own anxiety? 

01:11:15
MARIA I don't know. I feel like… I know it's a problem. 

01:11:20
KATHERINE HELM I think you're about to say but. 

01:11:25
[sil.] 

01:11:30
MARIA But… But I… I don't know. I don't know. 

01:11:35
KATHERINE HELM Why do you think you're stuck here? And it feels like we're stuck here too. Week after week, you know, you talk about how crippling this is and yet, you know, there's not been much progression in here or outside of here or even sometimes willingness to try something new, what is that about? 

01:11:55
MARIA I… Maybe I have a hard time accepting that this… this is real. 

01:12:05
KATHERINE HELM Tell me more. 

01:12:10
MARIA Like maybe if it's not real, then I don't have to… I don't know. I don't have to deal with it. 

01:12:20
KATHERINE HELM So maybe, if this is just kind of a normal experience that every graduate student goes through. 

01:12:20
MARIA Yeah. 

01:12:25
KATHERINE HELM There's nothing wrong here. 

01:12:25
MARIA Yeah, there's nothing wrong with me. 

01:12:30
KATHERINE HELM There's nothing wrong with you? 

01:12:30
MARIA Yeah. 

01:12:30
KATHERINE HELM Do you think that's what sort of this pushback is? Your boyfriend who's talked to you about, kind of struggling with anxiety, your parents have talked to you and you sort of said, we've talked in here. No… no… no. I just need to get through this paper, this test. 

01:12:40
MARIA Yeah. 

01:12:45
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. Tell me about what would be difficult if this was a real problem? 

01:12:50
MARIA Like, I have so much to deal with already. I have, you know, I've so many papers, I've presentations, I have… You know, I'm dealing with my family. Now it's like… Now I have to deal with… 

01:13:05
KATHERINE HELM You know, it's interesting. Even right here and now you're… you're kind of doing it again. 

01:13:05
MARIA Yeah. 

01:13:10
KATHERINE HELM Moving it to the back. Because it is though, right at the forefront of your experiences. It kind of permeates everything. 

01:13:20
MARIA Yeah. 

01:13:20
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

01:13:20
MARIA Yeah. 

01:13:25
KATHERINE HELM Does it have to mean though that there's something wrong with you? Can it mean that this is a real problem that maybe we can deal with, not that there's something wrong with Maria but this is an issue that you struggle with? 

01:13:40
MARIA Yeah. Yeah, I… I like the sound of that, better. 

01:13:45
KATHERINE HELM Okay. 

01:13:45
MARIA I still feel like something else I got to deal with. 

01:13:55
KATHERINE HELM Sure. Sure. But it, in some ways that has sort of your, umm… resistance to looking at this as a real problem that you're struggling with, in here has sort of halted our work or slowed it down. Do you feel that way or is that just… 

01:14:10
MARIA It's kind of like you know, because I don't want to deal with it. 

01:14:15
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

01:14:20
MARIA It's like… It's painful. Painful progress. 

01:14:25
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. And do you think it's sort of more painful, now that we're sort of really talking about it? 

01:14:30
MARIA It feels uncomfortable. 

01:14:35
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

01:14:35
MARIA I don't know it's painful. 

01:14:35
KATHERINE HELM Okay. Say more about uncomfortable. 

01:14:40
MARIA I feel like I've tried for so long to be like, no, this is not a thing. 

01:14:45
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

01:14:50
MARIA That to say, okay, there is something here. It's like, wait a minute. 

01:14:55
KATHERINE HELM So saying there is something here means what? 

01:14:55
MARIA Saying that maybe I… I do have to deal with this. 

01:15:00
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

01:15:00
MARIA Yeah, that feels scary. 

01:15:05
KATHERINE HELM Okay. And besides scary do you feel anything else? 

01:15:10
[sil.] 

01:15:15
MARIA Umm… Scary, uncomfortable. Umm… But also kind of like, let's just do it. 

01:15:25
KATHERINE HELM Okay. That's a… That's a pretty big breakthrough. 

01:15:25
MARIA Yeah. 

01:15:30
KATHERINE HELM We can deal with scary and uncomfortable, right. But sort of the roadblocks of, no… no, nothing to see here, not really an issue even though it is a serious issue that you're suffering, you know, that really kind of gets in the way of, you really enjoying your life. Now this is something that we can kind of really talk about and… and deal with. 

01:15:50
MARIA Yeah. 

01:15:55
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. I can still… You're still seen uncomfortable but, you know… 

01:15:55
MARIA Yeah. It's like what are we getting into. Now we're opening up this, you know, box that I don't… Well, I haven't wanted to deal with. 

01:16:05
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. I think maybe we can, you know, really work on processing that going forward. 

01:16:15
MARIA I think I'm open to that. 

01:16:20
DEBRIEFING OF SKILL NUMBER FOUR: 

01:16:20
Resistance 

01:16:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is this is a good example of resistance? 

01:16:25
KATHERINE HELM I think this is a very good example of resistance. 

01:16:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:16:30
KATHERINE HELM Umm… You know, at the heart of it, Maria doesn't want to think there's something wrong with me and none of us do, really, you know. Umm… What I was hoping that she sort of got from our work together is, this doesn't mean you're damaged or I something is wrong with you, this is something that you struggle with. And it is sort of damaging areas of your life more than you wanted to acknowledge. 

01:16:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, from a psychodynamic perspective in some ways, is this resistance like a defense, like a defense mechanism? 

01:17:00
KATHERINE HELM I think we could say that, Matt. You know, and with all defense mechanisms, they tell us something, right? They, you know, help us guard against anxiety for a particular reason. 

01:17:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:17:10
KATHERINE HELM Umm… And for Maria, I think she's sort of guarding against this idea that, I'm flawed or something is wrong with me. Umm… It's more than sort of normal, so what's… what's going on with me? 

01:17:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So there's kind of a push back against that… that, but at some point, it seems like that defense she has is no longer really working because it's the… What's happening, her life is getting more extreme? 

01:17:35
KATHERINE HELM Exactly. Exactly. And I think that kind of, and sort of touching on the resistance and challenging her a little bit about that, she had to say, okay, you know, that yes, it is spilling over into areas and I don't want that. 

01:17:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So I notice that even in that challenging it was… it was, you know, like a soft kind of won, it had a lot of empathy with it as well that you… you… you noted the resistance and you identified with her and you kind of push back, but it's a very gentle push. 

01:18:00
KATHERINE HELM Yes, resistance shouldn't be sort of busted through, if you will. Umm… Because then you're not really understanding why it's there in the first place. And it would be painful for Maria to sort of really view herself as being, you know, I'm all problem. So I wanted to separate that out and it was after I kind of said, you're struggling with anxiety, you're, basically not anxiety, that was really helpful in having her sort of, kind of look behind the resistance. 

01:18:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. So in a way that resistance is there for a reason, always it's protective of her. 

01:18:35
KATHERINE HELM Very much so. 

01:18:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And so that, push back, and all of a sudden she's exposed. 

01:18:35
KATHERINE HELM Exactly. 

01:18:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. So you kind of work with that and help her kind of understand in a way so that she's not overwhelmed. 

01:18:40
KATHERINE HELM Yes. Yes. 

01:18:45
PSYCHODYNAMIC THERAPY 

01:18:45
SKILL NUMBER FIVE: 

01:18:45
Confrontation 

01:18:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Skill number five:Confrontation. 

01:18:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So confrontation, what exactly is confrontation from a psychodynamic perspective? 

01:19:00
KATHERINE HELM Well, I kind of smiled because confrontation has this kind of very ominous all, you know… 

01:19:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:19:05
KATHERINE HELM And students often like, I don't want to do that. I don't want to confront my clients, but it's really more of a challenge or you're confronting some type of inconsistency and thought behavior, emotion, that helps the client again gain new insight into why they're doing what they're doing. 

01:19:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it's not getting someone's face? It's just… 

01:19:25
KATHERINE HELM It's not… It's not necessarily getting in someone's face. 

01:19:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. It sounds like, it's pointing out some discrepancies… 

01:19:30
KATHERINE HELM That's right. 

01:19:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Umm…And then kind of again using your relationship that you have, right, and leaning on that relationship to kind of lean into it? 

01:19:35
KATHERINE HELM Very much so. I think it's a necessary part of counseling work to sort of be able to confront clients, on sort of what we're seeing, those discrepancies, those inconsistencies. 

01:19:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Do you make any or what kind of assessment do you make with your client to understand kind of how much you can push and, if you should push? 

01:19:55
KATHERINE HELM Umm… I think that's a great question. And sometimes more difficult for early cancers to begin to assess. 

01:20:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:20:05
KATHERINE HELM Everything is housed in the relationship, right? And so if you have a solid rapport with your client, good relationships and if you keep hearing something, that's an… or two things that are in conflict with one another, you know, it begins to sort of set the stage for a confrontation. In the beginning your confrontations might be more, umm… sort of soft, umm… offered sort of, you know, in a way that's more tentative. 

01:20:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

01:20:30
KATHERINE HELM And as the relationship grows, you might offer them more definitively. But it's always housed in the relationship and then you can process what it was like for the client to be confronted on something, umm… after you do it. 

01:20:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So what I hear you kind of says that, like a confrontation is not like a sitcom, we have a close doors and walks away, you know, you have the comment and then you come back and you talk about it, right. The fact is, you're still in contact. 

01:20:55
KATHERINE HELM Yes, and I think kind of viewing it as in contact, right, helps, you know, developing counselors understand, you know, your modeling conflict and how to deal with conflict. So you confronts a client on something as I did with Maria, and then you process. Now how was it for you or what did that bring up for you? And those are really important because it allows that conflict to exist within the relationship. 

01:21:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like, in the clip we're gonna see, one thing to look for, is that kind of processing at the end. Is there everything else we should look for in this clip? 

01:21:25
KATHERINE HELM Well, I think you can look for some deeper themes. And so one of the things that we discovered is Maria doesn't like to show anger, even though I saw as I began to sort of confront her on this, about why she's not just sort of saying to her boyfriend, I'm really angry about this. She's sort of passive aggressively or sort of being sarcastic, which is angry, you know, but just…just not direct and then, you know, she got angry at me and I could sort of see it on her face. I just waited a little while and she brought it up first, which is great. Umm… And so we had a lot of theme work going on, which is sort of the heart of psychodynamic therapy anyway. 

01:22:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. So this is one of those clips, it sounds like, in which we want to kind of let it play out a little bit and then kind of see where it kind of takes you in terms of what emerges out of it? 

01:22:10
KATHERINE HELM Exactly. Exactly 

01:22:15
EXAMPLE OF SKILL NUMBER FIVE: 

01:22:15
Confrontation 

01:22:20
MARIA So I had another argument with my boyfriend, umm… this past week. I feel like we've had this argument so many freaking times. And I'm so sick of having the same argument, umm… because he's just, you know, he goes with his buddies all the time and I just… I don't like it. 

01:22:45
KATHERINE HELM So the kind of, this reoccurring argument is about how much time he spends with you versus how much time he spends with his friends? 

01:22:55
MARIA I just… I had another argument with my boyfriend because he, you know, he's doing it again, going out with his friends, staying out late at night. You know, I can't remember the last time, you know, that we went out. Like, you know, he sees them so often. I don't… I don't really like the people that he's seeing out with. I don't… You know, I don't really feel like… I don't know if a good influence is the right word, but I don't really… I don't really like them. I don't like them. 

01:23:35
KATHERINE HELM You know, and you sort of don't like the fact that he is spreading more and more time with his friends, less and less time with you? 

01:23:45
MARIA It feels that way. 

01:23:45
KATHERINE HELM Mm-hmm. 

01:23:45
MARIA It feels like, you know, like I'm being put to the side. Like he is out with his buddies, multiple times a week. Like I… 

01:23:55
[sil.] 

01:24:00
KATHERINE HELM What… what bothers you the most about this? I can see, you know, you're… you're pretty angry about it. So what bothers you the most about him spending all this time with his friends? 

01:24:05
MARIA That he could be spending that time with me. That's… And why… Why not? And or… You know, are they more funding than I am or, you know, because that's kind of how I'm feeling. 

01:24:20
KATHERINE HELM So some of the kind of issue behind, sort of angry on the surface but beneath that you really feel like you know is does this indicate a problem in our relationship? 

01:24:35
MARIA I don't know. 

01:24:40
KATHERINE HELM Maria, can you can you kind of walk me back through the last argument you had with him because this is kind of uh… becoming an increasing theme him spending more and more time with his friends. 

01:24:50
MARIA You know, it usually happens over the phone. 

01:24:55
KATHERINE HELM Okay. 

01:24:55
MARIA Where he's like, hey, I'm gonna go, you know, I'm gonna go out with Steve again and umm… some of my other buddies. He doesn't ask me like hey is it okay. Umm… He just, you know, it does that. 

01:25:10
KATHERINE HELM Just kind of announces it. 

01:25:10
MARIA Yeah, like this is what I'm doing, you know, I'll talk to you later. 

01:25:15
KATHERINE HELM And then how do you react to that? 

01:25:15
MARIA I'm pissed off. And… 

01:25:20
KATHERINE HELM And being pissed off you say… 

01:25:25
MARIA I say, I feel like I'm… it's kind of like that thing where you pretend you're okay with it, but you really better about it. So it's like… 

01:25:30
KATHERINE HELM How's that working to pretending to be okay with it? 

01:25:35
MARIA It's like a fake, it's like I'm being fake, like Well, have fun with, you know, the people I guess, they're more important than spending time with your girlfriend. 

01:25:45
KATHERINE HELM Maria, can I point something out? So sort of working with couples and being in a relationship myself, I've sort of heard arguments between couples that doesn't sound like how that really went. Tell me how it really went? 

01:26:00
MARIA I think, how this, how it went. I think, yeah. 

01:26:10
KATHERINE HELM You think he didn't know you were angry? 

01:26:15
MARIA He probably knew that I was angry. 

01:26:15
KATHERINE HELM Can you feel your sort of facial expression right now? You are really pissed. 

01:26:20
MARIA Yeah. 

01:26:25
KATHERINE HELM How does that sound when you're communicating that to him? Because if I can see it here I'm betting you can feel it over the phone. 

01:26:30
MARIA Yeah, he could probably hear my tone of voice because I am angry. I am mad. You know, why… why is it that he continues to do this. He knows that I'm angry from the tone of my voice he knows that I don't like it, but he's still… he still does it. 

01:26:55
KATHERINE HELM So, on the one hand he sort of told him, hey, I don't like that you're doing this and he keeps doing it. 

01:26:55
MARIA Yeah. 

01:27:00
KATHERINE HELM More often, right? And so you keep having these conversations sort of on the phone where you're not really saying what's, you know, the truth for you that you're very angry about it, but your fake nice as you say. 

01:27:10
MARIA Yeah, it's like a sarcastic. Like, yeah. 

01:27:15
KATHERINE HELM Why the sarcastic? Why not just say, how you truly feel? 

01:27:20
MARIA Because in that moment I am pissed off and I don't know if I want to let them know how I feel. That's… I think that's why. 

01:27:35
KATHERINE HELM How's that been working? 

01:27:40
MARIA While he still… 

01:27:40
KATHERINE HELM It's not working. 

01:27:40
MARIA He still doing it so… 

01:27:40
KATHERINE HELM It's not working. 

01:27:45
MARIA I guess not. 

01:27:45
KATHERINE HELM What is your reluctance to say I'm angry at you that you keep doing this? 

01:27:55
MARIA I don't, if… I don't… I don't know, my mother's reluctance, I don't know. I feel like I'm communicating my anger. 

01:28:05
KATHERINE HELM I'm wondering why you can't communicate your anger to him directly? 

01:28:10
[sil.] 

01:28:15
MARIA I don't know, what is, you know, what's gonna happen if I do that. 

01:28:20
KATHERINE HELM What do you fear will happen if you do that? 

01:28:20
MARIA I mean, we're kind of uh… in a tricky transition right now, we're making some big decisions about the future. What if he's like, he's just this angry person all the time, that now I'm going to have to deal with, you know, when we live together. 

01:28:35
KATHERINE HELM So it sounds like you are afraid to really confront him and say this bothers me, it makes me angry that you continue to go out and you announce it, right? We don't really discuss it, you just informed me, that it's happening because you're afraid that these big plans which are making, he's gonna view you differently, view you as being angry and then kind of change those plans. 

01:29:05
MARIA Yeah, I can see and say, like, you know, if you're, you know, I'm okay with this, then I'm not moving in with you. 

01:29:10
KATHERINE HELM So if you continue to hang out with your friends or… or really if… if you're the type of woman " Who doesn't allow to hang out with his friends, then I don't want to live with you," and that's what's present… preventing you from confronting him. 

01:29:25
MARIA I think so. 

01:29:25
KATHERINE HELM All while you live with these sort of really rough feelings of not being able to say your true… 

01:29:35
MARIA Yeah, and it's not fun, like I feel like I'm holding it in and it's not helping me. Like I… I feel, it's affecting me in other areas like, just as feeling angry constantly. 

01:29:45
KATHERINE HELM I can see it. 

01:29:45
MARIA Not being able to go to the person that's like my one yeah my one… 

01:29:50
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

01:29:50
MARIA My one support. 

01:29:55
KATHERINE HELM What's it like to talk about it in here with me? 

01:30:00
MARIA I don't know, I feel… I feel kind of pissed off. 

01:30:05
KATHERINE HELM I notice that. You're kind of even a little pissed off at me for bringing it up. 

01:30:10
MARIA Yeah. Because you know, what's the reaction when someone sees me this angry, and what are the consequences? 

01:30:20
KATHERINE HELM So do you think that I knew that you were kind of pissed off, I could see on your face, but… 

01:30:30
MARIA I think you probably did know. Yeah. 

01:30:30
KATHERINE HELM And we're still sort of talking. 

01:30:35
MARIA That is true. 

01:30:35
KATHERINE HELM And you've been with your boyfriend for four years. You think he doesn't know that you're pissed off at him over the phone as you're pretending to be nice? 

01:30:45
MARIA He probably does know. He probably does know. 

01:30:50
KATHERINE HELM Maria, from everything you've said in here he knows you pretty well. 

01:30:55
MARIA Yeah, he does. He's probably the person that knows me better than anyone else. Yeah. 

01:31:00
KATHERINE HELM So actually, instead of sort of I'm gonna use this term it might be a little loaded kind of passively aggressively kind of being sarcastic, saying, this really bothers me, I'd like to talk to you about it. How would that be for you? 

01:31:15
MARIA Uh… It's scary. 

01:31:20
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. You know, I think maybe something that's… something we can look at in here because this keeps happening. 

01:31:25
MARIA Yeah. 

01:31:30
KATHERINE HELM You know and you're sort of not really saying what's true for you, that you're really angry about it, that it bothers you, that it makes you feel many different things umm… he sort of knows it, you sort of know it, but yet you're really not talking to him about it. 

01:31:40
MARIA Yeah. 

01:31:45
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

01:31:45
MARIA Yeah. I feel angry, he knows that I feel angry, but I'm not gonna tell him that I'm angry, it doesn't… it doesn't seem helpful or… yeah. 

01:31:55
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

01:32:00
DEBRIEFING OF SKILL NUMBER FIVE:Confrontation 

01:32:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, that's a good example of confrontation. 

01:32:10
KATHERINE HELM I think it's a good example of confrontation because there were multiple examples. 

01:32:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, there are… yeah. 

01:32:15
KATHERINE HELM You know, I especially like the part where, you know, she gets angry at me for bringing it up in the first place because she doesn't really wanna deal with our anger. Umm… And in some ways that's great, that's exactly what, you know, psychodynamic therapy looks at multiple themes and ongoing things and that would be something that we would continue to work on together in future sessions. 

01:32:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON As it sounds like if anything or any person are going up with she should bring it up with you in some ways, knowing that you can respond back and unempathic manner. 

01:32:45
KATHERINE HELM Exactly, you know, and, you know, this isn't some ways what, you know, for it might be jumping for joy, if here because I could see it operating in the session. 

01:32:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:32:55
KATHERINE HELM You know, So there's the anger with her boyfriend and not being able to confront it directly, but she was actually able to confront me directly about that. 

01:33:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, that's true. 

01:33:00
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

01:33:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:33:00
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

01:33:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And… and you kind of process that with her? 

01:33:05
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

01:33:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, so that's that piece about kinda you did it with me and it how's that feel and what happened? 

01:33:10
KATHERINE HELM Exactly and that might really inform our kinda future work together. 

01:33:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. And there were some deeper themes that kinda came out of this. 

01:33:20
KATHERINE HELM Yes. Umm… The theme that angers very uncomfortable for her and the idea she's afraid to get angry and tell him directly. Umm… Even though, you know, as I pointed out he already knows because you want him to know, right? Uh… because it's damaging uh… you're afraid that he will say I don't want to move in with you anymore, it might damage their future plans together. 

01:33:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it's idea that… that she's using anger that again, that… that you know, I know and he knows that she's angry about it. 

01:33:45
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

01:33:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And… and maybe there's a way to write, oh she's just being angry. 

01:33:50
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

01:33:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON But the truth of the matter is that the anger it actually is maybe a cover or defense or something much deeper which is this fear of maybe abandonment or being that they're not gonna move in together. 

01:34:00
KATHERINE HELM Yes, being a wall. 

01:34:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Which… which he may not know. 

01:34:05
KATHERINE HELM Right, right and it kind of leads me to think about some other things, you know, how is anchor handling or childhood? You know, what was she taught about in anger or women or girls who get angry. And so, you know, again using the psychodynamic dynamic lens we can really take this one instance and look a lot deeper. Uh… From past themes to present themes. 

01:34:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, again if (inaudible) this previously this is another skill that's linked with other skills, right? So this isn't again as a one-off thing or do one confrontation, that's it. And it say, some of it like there's a cycle of things that kinda happened that all kind of come together. 

01:34:40
KATHERINE HELM Exactly. Because if we move forward with this that might be an example of working through umm… in that work there were also interpretations. So these skills really are linked together. 

01:34:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:34:50
PSYCHODYNAMIC THERAPY 

01:34:50
SKILL NUMBER SIX:Transference 

01:34:50
UNKNOWN Skill number six, Transference. 

01:34:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What is transference from the psychodynamic perspective? 

01:35:00
KATHERINE HELM Transference is where the client projects or sort of puts onto the counselor umm… issues, feelings umm… experiences, past experiences they've dealt with… with other people sometimes with similar traits. 

01:35:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so it's, it's kinda transferring experience other people often, but parents… often parents? Towards… towards the therapists are Counsellor. 

01:35:25
KATHERINE HELM Yes and the exciting thing about that from a psychodynamic perspective is when you see it you can actually work on it right here and now in the moment with the client. 

01:35:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. I like what you said it's exciting, because it's not something to be avoided. 

01:35:35
KATHERINE HELM Right. 

01:35:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You're actually… you're actively encouraging it as a counselor. 

01:35:40
KATHERINE HELM Yes and it sort of through a psycho analytic lens, you might be the blank slate. Umm… You know, Where your client, projects all this on to you because you don't show much of yourself. 

01:35:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:35:55
KATHERINE HELM Right, but psychodynamic uh… therapy really views transference as more than that. You don't have to be a blank slate for it to occur. 

01:36:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. And it sounds like, you know, that it… and I… (inaudible) theory please it's happening all the time. 

01:36:10
KATHERINE HELM That's right. 

01:36:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

01:36:10
KATHERINE HELM That's right. 

01:36:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And in potentially with you towards the… the client right over the counter trans will it be? 

01:36:15
KATHERINE HELM That's right. 

01:36:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON But again not something to shy away from its right to encourage and to use as part of the therapy. 

01:36:20
KATHERINE HELM Yes, because it's always happening, and I like what you said about being able to then use it because that's the point it occurs, so you should use it in your work with clients to for clients to gain new insight. 

01:36:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. And I noticed that the part about too is that, it sounds like this also brings it into the present. 

01:36:35
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

01:36:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Into the here and now with the client. 

01:36:40
KATHERINE HELM That's exactly right, which makes it more actionable. 

01:36:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:36:40
KATHERINE HELM Right? If I'm aware that it's an issue and it's even happening in here between you and I. I can actually sort of do something about it or manage it or understand it better. 

01:36:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So my hunch is that in some ways that raises the risk level too right? It's one thing for a client to tell a story about someone a boss and like that happening out there. 

01:36:55
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

01:37:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And then when you bring it to the president's happening between us… 

01:37:00
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

01:37:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You can't avoid it. 

01:37:05
KATHERINE HELM You… you know, only can you not avoid it but you don't know what's gonna happen next, and sometimes developing counselors it's very scary for them, but once you begin to learn how to recognize it and process it. I don't think we always recognize when it's happening not everything is transference, but you know, there's this richness of the relationship and exploring the dynamics or the psychodynamic between serve the client and I really uh… makes the experience much richer much deeper. 

01:37:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, and again it goes back to this notion that you really do this rests upon that quality of relationship you have with the client. 

01:37:40
KATHERINE HELM Exactly, exactly. Because it is risky. 

01:37:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:37:40
KATHERINE HELM It is. 

01:37:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So what should we be looking for in this clip? 

01:37:45
KATHERINE HELM In this clip again we're exploring themes of Maria's sort of issues, she sort of irritated umm… of people who are of a similar age to myself. Umm… Sort of dismissing this idea that or dismissing people her age. You know, dismissing millennial's, dismissing people in their early 20s saying, you don't have any real problems. 

01:38:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:38:10
KATHERINE HELM To the point where she's even questioning where me as her counselor can actually recognize that her problems are real. 

01:38:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so we should look for and maybe that moment in which he's talking about something out there… 

01:38:20
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

01:38:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …To this transition to something maybe happening in here. 

01:38:20
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

01:38:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And then how did the two of you talk about this. 

01:38:25
KATHERINE HELM exactly and how do we process it together. Yeah. 

01:38:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:38:30
EXAMPLE OF SKILL NUMBER SIX:Transference 

01:38:35
MARIA Had this like really awkward? Well, maybe not awkward frustrating situation recently, I'm sitting umm… I'm sitting in group supervision. 

01:38:45
KATHERINE HELM Okay. 

01:38:50
MARIA Umm… And it's a room full of people and this guy starts talking about how umm… 20-year-olds they don't, you know, their problems or whatever, their problems don't really matter. Oh, I've been there before, you'll be fine, honey. You'll be fine. Like that kind of… 

01:39:05
KATHERINE HELM Sort of framing them as developmental, you're 20 years old, you don't have real problems, like that? 

01:39:10
MARIA Yeah. Like, oh, so, what your worst problem is that you broke up with your boyfriend. Oh, so what? You know, you know, you can't this and that and I'm just sitting there like… dude, hello, we have problems. 

01:39:25
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

01:39:25
MARIA There are some real issues that I'm dealing with right now. 

01:39:30
KATHERINE HELM It sounds like you've felt pretty dismissed by that? 

01:39:35
MARIA Yeah, like I don't, I don't think he understands… I don't feel like, you know, I don't even know, you've understand really. Some of the stuff that I have to deal with. 

01:39:45
KATHERINE HELM You know, you don't feel like I would understand some of the things that you're going through because of our age difference? 

01:39:55
MARIA Yeah, I just feel like it's… it's a different generation like… Yeah, I just don't… don't think you'll get it. I really don't. And I've been, you know, dismissed multiple times, it wasn't just this one time. I've heard snarky remarks in the… in the past like 20-year-old fluff problems or whatever like these are not real issues that we're dealing with. 

01:40:20
KATHERINE HELM So it sounds like this incident triggered for you kind of… you know, but even though this is something that sounds like you've been kinda dealing with, but you haven't really talked about it in here? 

01:40:30
MARIA No, I haven't because honestly I don't feel like… you know, what if you're that person too? What if you're like you know, whatever 20-year olds, what do they have to deal with? 

01:40:45
KATHERINE HELM Let me ask you this, you know, we've been working together for a number of sessions and this hasn't come up directly before. This idea that because I'm 20 plus years older than you that I can't get it or I might be dismissing, do… does it feel like that in the room here with me? 

01:41:05
MARIA No, I don't think I've felt it before, but there's definitely a little bit of apprehension from me like what if she doesn't get it, there's like, but no, I haven't felt it. 

01:41:20
KATHERINE HELM And so when our early work together or at least when I went out to the waiting room to kind of come get you and you sort of see I'm a middle aged woman coming to get you, your reaction was? 

01:41:30
MARIA Like, is she gonna just be like, this is not a big deal. You need to figure it out. Umm… Don't be a baby. That's kind of… that's kind of my reaction to most people that, you know, are older than me. Because I'm it's been my experience in the past. 

01:41:50
KATHERINE HELM Feeling dismissed, you know, there's a lot kind of going on between Generation X and you know, the… the millennial generation… 

01:41:55
MARIA Yeah. 

01:42:00
KATHERINE HELM …You know. And now even… even though we've been working together for a while, Now it's coming up again. 

01:42:05
MARIA Yeah, because I've heard recently quite a bit, and I'm like, I'm so over it. 

01:42:15
KATHERINE HELM Yeah, how might we work through that together? Because, you know, I can… I can say to you that I… I don't feel like I've dismissed your problems, it's sounds like you haven't felt that way, how… have you? 

01:42:25
MARIA No, I haven't. 

01:42:25
KATHERINE HELM Okay. And yet there's some suspicion maybe towards me because of our age differences? 

01:42:35
MARIA Yeah, like… like there's this part of me that's like… because she hasn't shown, she hasn't been dismissive, but if she's thinking like maybe in your mind, you're like uh… this is like baby stuff. But to me it feels like real stuff. 

01:42:50
KATHERINE HELM And how do you know the difference between me uh… you know, and somebody out there, someone you come to for counseling. Am I dismissing… am I dismissing your feelings, your thoughts and your problems? Versus this guy who said you're 20 something and this isn't a big deal? 

01:43:10
MARIA Yeah, I don't think, I mean, he actually said it. 

01:43:15
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

01:43:15
MARIA He actually said… he actually sat there and went, no, offense, but… I know when someone says, no offense but… 

01:43:20
KATHERINE HELM Yeah, then they're about to be offensive. 

01:43:25
MARIA Yeah. 

01:43:25
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

01:43:25
MARIA So I feel like with him he was just (inaudible) put it out there. And it pissed me off. 

01:43:30
KATHERINE HELM Yeah, and to… to the point even where and I do want to compliment you, I think it's really difficult to come here then and say and you too, it… it could be you. Umm… But, you know, until we sort of bring it up and look at it and… and I, you know, if I'm honest with you, I… you know, early on I sort of saw how you looked at me and the way to Graham, and I was wondering if that… that might be an issue? 

01:43:55
MARIA Yeah. 

01:43:55
KATHERINE HELM Umm… So I'm… I'm grateful that you… you brought it up, because that will influence our work together. So how do we know then if this will be an issue operating in the room? This idea that, you know, because you're a millennial, right? And you know, uh… generation X or such as myself there's been some negative things between those generations, at least in (inaudible) anyway. And yet here we are, what do we do about that, Maria, together? 

01:44:25
MARIA I don't know, there's a part of me that's like, what have I done, right now, I put this out there. I mean, and then there's a part of me that's like, okay, well, now it's out there. 

01:44:35
KATHERINE HELM Now it's out there. 

01:44:35
MARIA So there's no going back. Umm… So I feel like almost I can be, you know, I can be more open about it. Like now you know. 

01:44:45
KATHERINE HELM Now I'm notice that this is sort of, you know, the age difference between us could be an issue. 

01:44:50
MARIA Yeah. 

01:44:55
KATHERINE HELM You know? Umm… And I… I wonder in some ways you… so you haven't felt like I've been dismissive. 

01:44:55
MARIA No. 

01:45:00
KATHERINE HELM Would you feel comfortable though? If you felt like I really didn't understand something in these kind of generational effects might be operating between you and I might should be comfortable bringing it to my attention? 

01:45:10
MARIA Umm… That's… that's tricky. 

01:45:15
KATHERINE HELM Tell me about the trickiness of that. 

01:45:15
MARIA It's kind of like the umm… kind of the unspoken anger that we were talking about, like it's there. But addressing it like how are you gonna react? 

01:45:30
KATHERINE HELM How am I reacting now because you just brought it up? 

01:45:35
MARIA You seem, okay. 

01:45:35
KATHERINE HELM I'm pretty, okay? 

01:45:35
MARIA Yeah. 

01:45:40
KATHERINE HELM I'm glad that you brought it up. Right you sort of brought it into conscious awareness and sort of, you know, we can't work on it, we can't be aware of it together and high influences our relationship without being able to discuss it. And you know, and I will tell you I… I won't understand everything. I don't sort of put it on myself as the counter to understand everything. Umm… But it is your story, so you are kind of the expert on your own experience. Right? And so just like every 20-year-old or 24-year-old is not the same. You know, so I wonder, if he was just kind of a bad example. 

01:46:20
MARIA Pretty bad example. 

01:46:20
KATHERINE HELM Pretty bad example. 

01:46:25
MARIA But I like… I like the idea of me being the expert because I… I can't say that I feel that very often. So you know, there's something… there's something that feels good about that. 

01:46:35
KATHERINE HELM And do you feel like the I have treated you in our relationship like the expert on your own story here? 

01:46:40
MARIA I think so. I think there's been times where you challenged me a bit, but… but, yeah, I think so. 

01:46:50
KATHERINE HELM So I'm gonna ask the question again. How comfortable would you be just like you did today bringing up, if you feel like you're being dismissed or I'm not treating you like the expert of your own story? 

01:47:05
MARIA I would be uncomfortable. 

01:47:05
KATHERINE HELM Okay, fair. 

01:47:05
MARIA But I feel like I see the value in doing that. 

01:47:10
KATHERINE HELM And I do wanna reminding you just did it in a very powerful way. Sort of I had been getting those feelings, you have been feeling this way and today you really brought it up. 

01:47:20
MARIA Yeah. 

01:47:20
KATHERINE HELM Yeah. 

01:47:20
MARIA It was uncomfortable for sure. 

01:47:25
KATHERINE HELM And now? 

01:47:30
MARIA I feel calm. I feel good about it. 

01:47:30
KATHERINE HELM I feel good that you did it too. 

01:47:35
[sil.] 

01:47:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So is this a good example of transference? 

01:47:40
KATHERINE HELM I do believe it's a good example of transference. It… I think it doesn't always occur that way. 

01:47:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:47:45
KATHERINE HELM Because Maria becomes very aware of it and she brings it to me. 

01:47:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:47:50
KATHERINE HELM You know, sometimes uh… you know, in psychodynamic therapy, the uh… counselor will bring it up, but she directly brings it to me and in some ways that's even better because, you know, it allows her to accept that it's happening and what can we do. 

01:48:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, I noticed that there is an element in which uh… you know, she talks about the out their supervisor. 

01:48:10
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

01:48:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And then she kinda begin mix that with more general of being dismissed by the other people. 

01:48:15
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

01:48:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And then there's a moment in which it kind of moves to kind of the two of you. 

01:48:20
KATHERINE HELM That's right because I don't even know if you sort of take me seriously. Umm… And I think that I… you know, I think… I probably or hopefully did a good job of not getting defensive about it but really exploring with her umm… you know, this is happening, you know, what do we do about it? How will we know and I think I may have asked her like three times. Umm… You know, will you tell me? Each time she said I'm… I'll be uncomfortable… I'll uncomfortable, but you know, she did say I will tell you. 

01:48:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah, it's interesting what you said, you know, you said, I don't know, if you understand me. 

01:48:55
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

01:48:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON The look in some ways like… like a flip remark and a bit like it wasn't a fully conscious thing, but it came out. 

01:49:00
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

01:49:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I noticed that you then Wade didn't let that kinda go, you have an opening that kinda say, I've… I've wondered that too. 

01:49:10
KATHERINE HELM Yes, because I want her to feel free to be able to explore with me. 

01:49:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:49:15
KATHERINE HELM Umm… Sometimes clients will say, well, what are you thinking, right? I will usually just tell them what I'm thinking. 

01:49:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:49:20
KATHERINE HELM Because I want them to feel free to understand our relationship as kind of a way to really explore things more deeply. 

01:49:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:49:30
KATHERINE HELM Right. And if I say, so, you know, sometimes the textbooks say, we say, well, why do you wanna know what I'm thinking? 

01:49:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:49:35
KATHERINE HELM I weigh all that in the relationship, but this… this was very important for her to be able to bring to me in a way that she has not been able to do with the supervisor and other people. And so I'm hoping that now (inaudible) our relationship be sort of a corrective emotional experience, but she can feel more assertive about, you know, addressing these things outside of the therapy room. 

01:50:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so we saw like about, now I'm in a window of kinda this coming up, umm… but it sounds like this would be a continuation then, so we kinda went beyond here on a future work with Maria, sounds like you would work on being attuned to when this came up… 

01:50:15
KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

01:50:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And you… you might bring it up again, I kind of say, are these moments happening now? 

01:50:20
KATHERINE HELM Yes, and I even, I think I said to her, you know, Maria, I may not always understand this because it is true umm… but I want us to be able to talk about when you think I'm not understanding? I think it was powerful for her when I said you're the expert on your own experience. 

01:50:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yes, you said, that which is not used to hearing that. 

01:50:35
KATHERINE HELM Yes, and I think that… that's something that will sort of take it a future sessions and explore more deeply because clients are the expert on their own experience, you know, we as counselors help them explore their experience and through a psychodynamic perspective come to a new understanding, but, you know, only Maria can live her own life. 

01:50:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So if this were to be successful with her and she'd be able to kind of again work through the transference with you over time, what could she gained from that? 

01:51:05
KATHERINE HELM You know, what I'm hoping she can gain from that is sort of uh… a grounding in sort of who she is that she is knowledgeable and again the expert in her own experience, but hopefully sort of develop more assertiveness around saying, hey, you know, not all 20 year olds are the same, just like not all sort of middle age people are the same, and my experience is valuable. 

01:51:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:51:25
KATHERINE HELM And… and some of that is because I also value her experience.
