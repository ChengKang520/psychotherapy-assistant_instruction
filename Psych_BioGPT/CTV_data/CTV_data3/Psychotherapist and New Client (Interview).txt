DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  So in this unit we have presented four deferent ways or modes of responding to people. Exploratory responses that keep people involved in the conversation and help them explore their thoughts and feelings. Listening responses that demonstrate your desire to understand and allow you to check out your perception of what another is saying. Affect recognition Responses that focus on the emotions underlying many of our behaviors and Meta-communication Responses that acknowledge the generally unspoken messages that exist between you and the people with whom you interact. Together this response modes provide you with a basic set of communication tools, each one unique and powerful in it's own way. Up to this point in order to demonstrate individual skills clearly, we have shown you specially constructed scenes using actors. Now, we would like to show you someone using these skills in an actual candid session between a client and a psychotherapist it's a first session. The therapist has had many use of experience as a psychotherapist and professor of Psychology. We think you will agree that he is an effective communicator. See if you can spot any instances where he just naturally uses the tools that are included in the elements of communication.

Psychotherapist and New Client (Interview Phase) 

00:02:20
JOHN  Uhm, I, I told you how that brother was in the National Guard, 

00:02:30
DOZIER THORNTON  Yes. 

00:02:35
JOHN Christian he wouldn't drink, smoke or swear... 

00:02:35
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:02:35
JOHN ...and then he beat up those men. 

00:02:40
DOZIER THORNTON Uh hmm. 

00:02:40
JOHN And after he get out of the National Guard, a few years later he took up drinking and then, he, he gave up religion but my ma has loved, honored, worshiped, cherished and adored him. 

00:02:55
DOZIER THORNTON Uh hmm. 

00:02:55
JOHN And the ground he walks on, but with me she has condemned to me, condemned every move I made, she might even deny it. She hates my taste in music, she tells me I'll never amount to anything. 

00:03:10
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:03:10
JOHN She tells me I'm sick, she tells me I'm paranoid, she asks me whether I'm sick, she ask me whether I'm paranoid. So my brother was whom she worships, who was inconsistent with his behavior... (crosstalk) 

00:03:25
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:03:25
JOHN ...but yet with her behavior she is always consistently given him the love, the respect... 

00:03:35
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:03:35
JOHN ...and the kind words, and with me it's she has to condemn everything I do, she have to. (crosstalk) 

00:03:40
DOZIER THORNTON How do you feel about that? 

00:03:40
JOHN  How do I feel about that, ah, ah, good word is rejected. 

00:03:45
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. And what's the feeling of being rejected? How does that affect you? (crosstalk) 

00:03:50
JOHN Well, I guess, I guess it get, gets me the feeling that others reject me. 

00:03:55
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:03:55
JOHN So as I just said a minute ago when, when a friend calls me on the telephone I'm, I'm so thrilled, you know, 

00:04:00
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:04:00
JOHN to think someone, ah, takes interest in calling long distance for 20 minutes or thereabout. 

00:04:05
DOZIER THORNTON So you kind of expect that no matter what you do in the world, (clears throat) people aren't going to give you the affection and the love and attention that you'd like have. 

00:04:15
JOHN That has been a thought of mine although... (crosstalk) 

00:04:15
JOHN ...my thought on that has been changing little bit, I've been... 

00:04:20
DOZIER THORNTON Oh. 

00:04:20
JOHN ...looking at people as individuals instead of as a group. 

00:04:25
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:04:25
JOHN You know, I know each person has individual traits and differences, you know, and for a long while it's hard for me to believe. 

00:04:35
DOZIER THORNTON That someone could like you, or would like you. 

00:04:35
JOHN  Ah, I'm lost here. 

00:04:40
DOZIER THORNTON For a long time it was hard for you to believe that someone would like you or could like you. 

00:04:45
JOHN  Yes. 

00:04:50
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:04:55
[sil.] 

00:04:55
JOHN  I've had a few friends for a number of years and they're really good friends. 

00:05:00
DOZIER THORNTON You seem to feel sad at this point. 

00:05:05
JOHN Do you see that or sense that or what? 

00:05:05
DOZIER THORNTON Yes. 

00:05:05
JOHN  Sad? I'm not really sad. 

00:05:10
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:05:10
JOHN This past week has been quite a pleasant one, the past to weeks had been pleasant. 

00:05:15

00:05:15
JOHN  At that moment. (crosstalk) 

00:05:20
DOZIER THORNTON ...thinking about your friends. 

00:05:20
JOHN Sad. Can't think of anything sad about it, though. 

00:05:25
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:05:30
[sil.] 

00:05:30
DOZIER THORNTON  What are you thinking? 

00:05:40
JOHN What am I thinking? Huh. I'm thinking how nice and cosy as I sat here. (laughs) 

00:05:45
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. You feel comfortable now? 

00:05:45
JOHN Yeah. 

00:05:45
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. That's okay. 

00:05:50
JOHN No, that was, that was, my, my problem, ah, I ah, grew up in the country, never learned to drive until I was about 30, never moved away from home until I was 24. 

00:06:05
DOZIER THORNTON How old are you now? 

00:06:05
JOHN 33. 

00:06:05
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:06:05
JOHN  Uhm, and when, ah, you know, when I was in the country, on a farm I wasn't permitted to have friends 'coz they might teach me to get on dope... 

00:06:20
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:06:20
JOHN ...or a certain older friend, who was old enough to be my ma, who drinks 'coz they could teach me to drink, but ah, lot of few years go by and my ma and then that woman can become best of friends and go on vacation trips together. But yet when that woman's back is turned, my ma could talk about her they way she talks about me... 

00:06:35
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:06:35
JOHN  to my face. 

00:06:40
DOZIER THORNTON What is it you're trying to do with your mother? You seem to have a tremendous amount of anger toward her and you, you keep coming back to her as though she's done some unforgivable thing to you, that you wanna get her for. 

00:06:55
JOHN She sure ah, did and if I could use the dirty word I would. She screwed up my life. 

00:07:00
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. In what way? 

00:07:00
JOHN  In anyway you wanna look at it. 

00:07:05
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. She screwed up your life. 

00:07:05
JOHN  Uh-huh. 

00:07:10
DOZIER THORNTON (clears throat) There was a time when she probably had major responsibility for what was going on in your life but you're an adult now. 

00:07:15
JOHN All right, but when I was in my teens I wa, I was mature enough then to know what I was going to be doing. 

00:07:20
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:07:20
JOHN  I associate with the, new people that moved in the neighborhood when I was in my teens. 

00:07:25
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:07:25
JOHN  Ah, they drink beer, they'd smoke cigarettes, they're mature people, full grown. 

00:07:35
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:07:35
JOHN I have know them for, more than about 16 years now. And as many times I visit them and whenever I do, from day one to now, they never offered me any beer or anything else. 

00:07:45
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:07:45
JOHN They're really fun people to live with. 

00:07:50
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:07:50
JOHN And then ah, you know. 

00:07:55
DOZIER THORNTON John, what is it that keeps you locked into your mother? 

00:08:00
JOHN Brother, I can't get to that answer, yet but I'm working on it. 

00:08:00
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. You know how she is? 

00:08:05
JOHN  Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
DOZIER THORNTON You know, that for example she seems to prefer your older brother to you, is that correct? 

00:08:15
JOHN Correct. 

00:08:15
DOZIER THORNTON And it seems like you keep wanting to change that in some way. 

00:08:20
JOHN Well, I guess that's an impossibility. (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:08:20
JOHN  My best bet is to keep my distance from her. 

00:08:25
DOZIER THORNTON Do you do that? 

00:08:25
JOHN Oh, I've done it for 10, 11 months now. 

00:08:30
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. And yet one of the things that seems to be uppermost in your mind today is your relationship with her. 

00:08:35
JOHN Well, hmm, (sigh) people were suppose to have nice relationships with their mothers, I didn't. 

00:08:45
DOZIER THORNTON Where, where did you get that? 

00:08:45
JOHN  In order to, to really get her around and get along well in life, I have been told that, yes, by different people. 

00:08:55
DOZIER THORNTON You have tell the good relationship with your mother... 

00:09:00
JOHN Right. (crosstalk) 

00:09:00
DOZIER THORNTON ...in order to have a good relationship with me. 

00:09:00
JOHN Or other people, yes. 

00:09:00
DOZIER THORNTON  Explain to me how that follows? 

00:09:05
JOHN  Hmm, maybe I'd, maybe I misunderstood something ah. 

00:09:15
[sil.] 

00:09:15
JOHN  Maybe ah, maybe the way I interpreted it as with people or I should say with women... (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:09:25
JOHN ...because I'm not married and I'm very choosy. 

00:09:30
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:09:30
JOHN I want a woman who doesn't drink or smoke... (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:09:35
JOHN ...because I don't drink or smoke and I want my own kind. 

00:09:40
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:09:40
JOHN It's almost an impossibility to do and then I feel uncomfortable. And ah, also with my growing up in the woods, stick of the woods and the farm, I'd never was permitted to go into town, never permitted to date, all right. So now, I'm only learning what I should have learned about, ah, about 18 years ago. 

00:10:05
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:10:05
JOHN  Yeah, and ah, I think of instances where I asked a girl out and get a negative answer and previously this would have, really have hurt my feelings but only now, I have to having a little learning experience with this, do I realize that. Ah, this are ah, mistakes, and you learn by mistakes. 

00:10:30
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. 

00:10:30
JOHN  And I know what a number of them are. So I'm going, I'm developing new approaches. 

00:10:35
DOZIER THORNTON Yeah, that's fine, yeah. You, you see that in some way's your own development as a child was retarded compared to many people in our culture. 

00:10:45
JOHN  Right. 

00:10:50
DOZIER THORNTON But at the same time you're out there trying now your, trying to make up for the lost time. 

00:10:50
JOHN  Uh-huh, and I'm feeling a lot happier this way two. 

00:10:55
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. That's fine. 

00:11:00
[sil.] 

00:11:00
DOZIER THORNTON  Tha, that seems to be more freeing in a sense. (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
JOHN Yes, I feel like jaywalking now. (laughs) 

00:11:10
DOZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. (laughs). 

00:11:10
DR. HENYA KAGAN Well, there you have a real interview with the skills comfortably within the repertoire of the interviewer, although they are not always used. However, as Doctor Kagan mentioned in the introductory film knowing this skills does not mean that you will be comfortable using them in your interactions with other's. Why? Well, that is the question the affix in relation unit and IPR training program is designed to answer.
