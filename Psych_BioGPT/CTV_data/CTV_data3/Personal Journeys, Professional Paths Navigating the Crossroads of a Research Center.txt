SPERO MANSON  Thank you very much. Aanii, Boozhoo, in the words of my people. I'm an Anishinaabe from the Turtle Mountain Reservation, North Dakota. What I thought I would do this after, it qualifies as afternoon, this afternoon is share with you a little bit about the journey across the ah, educational experiential landscape in terms of preparing American and Alaskan Native ah, physicians and social behavioral, as well as health scientists to continue to move forward ah, in as scientists. And I'll place it within the context of the journey that ah, many of us experience in our early years but particularly American Indian and Alaskan Natives. And then end with talking, not only about the structure and process of one of the major programs that exist today in the United States to prepare ah, these young scholars for independent careers to lead ah, the scholarship in the health and behavioral scientist, but also share with you what I think are some of the keys to success in doing so. And I think those keys ah, to success have many lessons to teach us broadly not just with respect to postdoctoral and post residency preparation but also the earlier stages as well. First off, let me just begin a little bit with a broader context and to note that ah, among American Indian and Alaskan Natives ah, nearly 40 percent of our children drop out between sixth and seventh grade. That's an odds of about one out of every two and a half children. I think the ah, reasons for this are numerous, only right of ah, and I'll work of flower of two soils, it's a flower of many soils with respect to Indian and Native children growing up ah, in multiple worlds and the stresses and conflicts that are a part of that. Uhm, the fascinating thing though is of course, uhm, my, I'll just step back for a moment. My father who, ah, left us about three years ago was an inveterate, ah, gambler, small stakes and it was hardly a Plaid Pantry or a 7-Eleven that we'd, we would drive past that he wouldn't find some reason. "Do you need fuel son? Uhm, I have to stop to use the restroom. Can we get a bottle of wa, water or cup of coffee?" To stop in at that uhm, Quick Stop grocery store. And ah, while there, he would buy one of these little scratch cards. And so, I was introduced to scratch cards in that way. Well, I picked up three scratch cards over the Christmas holidays ah, out of Seattle, Washington, and here's the first. Now, the odds of graduating from high school are one in 2.56 for American Indian and Alaska Natives. The odds of winning on this scratch card are 1 in 2.1. You're more likely to win a prize on this scratch card than you are, if you're American Indian Alaska Native child to graduate uhm, from sixth or seventh grade. Moving up a little further in the pipeline, uhm, while nearly ah, sixty cent, over 60 percent of children broadly in the United States youth graduate from high school and go on to college, this is true of only 17 percent of American Indian or Alaska Native ah, students. The odds of continuing, moving from high school to college then for American Indians is of one in just under 3,000. Again here, the reasons are numerous. They have to deal with the lack of role models among their families. They have to deal with the difficulty in access to quality education. They have to deal with the variety of other kinds of problems that play in youth at this particular stage in the developmental process. And that impair their ability, both the bond with educational institutions as well as to master the subjects before them. Now, whereas the odds of graduating from high school or just under 1 in 3,000 for American Indians were odds of winning on this particular ah, bingo card that I picked up and I happened to have won on this one as well as graduating from high school myself was 1 in 1,800. So uhm, just less than twice ah, the prospect of winning on that particular bingo card than it is graduating from high school and going on to college among American Indian and Alaska native youth. Now, it was in 1999 that the National Institutes of Health, the premier uhm, sponsor of be, biomedical research in this country ah, and also one of the major supporters of health- related research ah, reported that it funded approximately 35,000 grants. The individuals who received those grants were referred to as principal investigators. Of the 35,000 principal investigators in 1999, only nine were American Indian or Alaska Native. The odds then at that point in time would be in a principal investigator who's American Indian or Alaska Native in, in a sponsored research grant was just under 1 in 4,000. Now, if you take in the fact that there's some duplication, I'm somewhat embarrassed to say at that particular time, I had four of the nine grants so there were five ah, Ame, unique American Indian or Alaska native principal investigators. The true odds were 1 in 7,000 of being a principal investigator uhm, of an NIH grant. Ah, now, why is it important to be a principal investigator of an NIH grant? There are several reasons. First, it reflects the assessment by one's peer in the academy, as well as that particular institution of the excellence of your work and your preparation and readiness to move forward and to conduct research that will contribute to the larger body of knowledge. But equally important is the fact that it's the gateway into leadership with respect to the scientific world. Uhm, until you reach that point, you're not often a member of the small and increasingly elite group that has the opportunity to identify what the research priorities are, to craft the questions, to indicate, and to advocate and promote what the priorities for that research are, should be. Uhm, now, the odds or you may call them 1 in 7,000, this particular bingo card which I also won fifty dollars in this particular case uhm, at over this last Christmas holiday. I won in 4,250 of winnings. So you have greater odds of winning ah, on the lottery in the State of Washington than you do in being an NIH ah, independently funded scientist. Now, the pipeline with respect to underrepresented ah, minorities or URMs or urms, as my father used to say, such as American Indians and the pipeline of moving into biomedical behavioral research position is really flawed or there disconnects the three major junctions at least in this pipeline. The first is that URM students uhm, had a hard time entering the pipeline ah, due to critical disparities in academic preparation uhm, especially at the high school stage and intimately related to the reason and the frequency of dropout. And this is especially in comparison to majority of students and this is well documented. Secondly, the pipeline links at a number of points. Uhm, URM students are more likely to dropout of the pipeline before attending or before completing college as I anticipated in the earlier slide. And we American Indian and Alaska Natives actually have the highest college dropouts in those graduation rates among all minorities in the United States. So even as precious few of us make it from high school to college, the rates of co, of dropout are extraordinary and further uhm, reduce our, our ability to represent the particular social and cultural perspectives that we're likely to bring to these activities at the later stages of, of, of educational and scientific maturity. And third, only a small trickle of us ultimately make it to the doctoral uhm, level itself and successfully pass through the end of the pipeline and find employment in the academy, for example at the other end. Ah, lots of reasons for this uhm, in particular and I'll share some of them in, in just a moment or two, but they relate not only to the challenges with respect to the materials and the preparation to deal with the materials that are focused for our particular gradu, ah, graduate education, but they have to deal with other kinds of committee, competing demands that are shared in large part with many others such as the challenges with respect to personal crisis and family challenges ah, the ability to pay financially for ones education, as well as ultimately in terms of the meaningfulness of that education that fit with who you are, (inaudible ) American Indian Alaska Native, and usually, we may have native with respect to your own career development. We find this is especially true for underrepresented minority women ah, who are rarely found at the top of the faculty in science departments across re, research universities and the nation as a whole. And in fact, my wife who's ah, non-native ah, is the professor of medicine at the University of Washington. And in the department of medicine there are in fact, in the division of internal medicine, there are nearly 300 faculty members. She was the first, eight years ago, female professor in her division in the last twenty years and she was one of only two ah, female professors out of 300. So this is a challenge that is specific to women but it is a matter of double jeopardy for women from underrepresented minority groups among whom their representation is even less at those senior ranks ah, in major ah, behavioral health and science departments across the country. And really, the shortage of minority faculty members is, is a, is a result of too few moving on and attaining MDs and PhDs, ah, and then subsequently choosing to work in the academy and that trita, titrates into even fewer who may make the choice to pursue research as an ah, career avenue later in their academic life. In a more pessimistic vein there was a report from 2000, "Nature" by Wickware, who indicated that once you become ah, uhm, a faculty member, an underrepresented minority scientist but your likelihood of being tenure and promoted is even less and it's reflected in terms of the ah, fewer grants, fewer publications and contracts, which is really the coin of the realm in most of these institutions for advancement ah, to associate into full professor and tenurability(ph). The regions or legion ah, at this particular level which makes it even sad given this far fewer numbers that make it to this point of accomplishment in their careers. The typical scenario has to do with one's, one's ah, young assistant professor in one of these institutions. You're a rare commodity. And as a rare commodity, the institution places inordinate demands on you above and beyond those that are required to succeed ah, in ah, their blueprints. They're ah, constantly bombarded with ah, request to be served on committees to be that ah, individual to represent that particular cultural or social perspective. Ah, you're expected to uhm, provide ah, advice and counseling to all of the students from your particular cultural background. You're expected to teach courses and to work in areas that from the point of view of the institution, will advance its portfolio with respect to quote/unquote "sensitivity and expertise" in your particular area. Now, well uhm, laudable and important, all of those demands actually erode one's ability to publish and to acquire grants and to actually acquire the coin of the realm uhm, in terms of advancement to boss, more senior levels ah, in academic ranks and for tenurability(ph). The problem is, is that you, as a young faculty member, frequently don't know what the blueprint for success is. It's not often explicit, it's very ah, unclear about, that there is a blueprint for success. And there're not many people who are clambering, unfortunately, as they are on the other side with respect to your contribution to the institute, institution about how the institution commit ah, ah, contribute to your ah, success as a, as a member of the academy.

SPERO MANSON  That science that nature review concluded that underrepresented minority exper, ah, students experience a range of obstacles under which I've anticipated in their journey, especially to research competence and academic success, success. That article concluded that the answer lies in figuring out how to place these individuals in the early points in the pipeline and even as junior faculties in a Research Level I Institution such as this. Now, uhm, there are a number of barriers to doing so. What are some of those barriers? Some of the barriers are shared by all of us. They have to do with educational competencies and experiences whether or not we were able to form a meaningful and lasting bond with the mentor earlier in that pipeline experience, whether or not ah, we found ways to connect personally as well as professionally to the subject matter within our disciplines, whether or not we had role models uhm, ah, among ah, the individuals that we deemed as somehow relevant to our own personal professional journeys ah, related to a competing career options and priorities. For example, uhm, I worked with American Indian Alaska Native doctoral and uhm, ah, postdoctoral and, and, ah, post-doctorate and resident fellows. Ah, there's an enormous ah, attraction to the clinical fields. And the reason being is because the laying honds or the hands therapeutically is extremely rewarding and it's immediately gratifying, and it fits with the ah, expectancies that we bring largely from our communities or families, to what we should be doing professionally. And we very seldom have the same sort of expectancies to the role models and the understanding in our families and communities about research and what the scientific endeavor can actually contribute to the world being a family and community and, and, and present itself as a meaningful career course for us. Healthcare experiences uhm, ah, are a frequent uhm, barrier as well. American Indian Alaska Natives are ah, at high risk for a large number of problems ah, early in their adult lives. Diabetes uhm, particularly ah, and those kinds of health problems present barriers. They are abs, actually financial problems that are ah, numerous and well-documented among ah, underrepresented minorities that are also treated with respect to American Indians. But there are also some that are not well-documented and that are frequently ah, undetected and misunderstood, if recognized at all, that are specific to American Indian Alaska Natives. Ah, there's a wonderful keynote this morning because our speaker this morning actually anticipated a number of these pieces. But for American Indian Alaska Natives, that cultural connection is really critical ah, as our family and friends, not only as a support system but as a system for reaffirming the choices that we made helping us think through the, the tough decisions that we are often faced with, and, and figuring out the balance in terms of the demands and the rewards ah, that are embodied with those decisions. And frequently for us as American Indians, issues of spirituality are critical. And I think it's ah, experienced my ah, by many minority members as well as women or issues of discrimination. I'll never forget an example of working in my early years in the, in the, I think it was 1980 or 1981. I was working among the Hopi people in the Southwest. And in this particular case during ah, while interviewing an, an elder woman from their tribe, she was in the process of making a basket, a basket that was made out of concentric circles of color. And at the very center of the circle was a, a, a, a vibrant blue and around that was a, a larger circle on that she had woven of yellow. And outside of that one a purple and then a black and so forth, and I asked her what she was doing and she looked at me smiling. She says, "I'm, I'm, I'm recreating myself." And she says, "Do you know what I mean?" And I said, "No, I don't. Tell me." And she proceeded to tell me. I took a, a slide of that particular basket in the making and I, and I ah, and, and I showed it to ah, a class, I think it was a year or two later of residents and medical students, about 30 or 40 of them. It was in the class in which I would uhm, was seeking to expand their vision about what constitutes the healing arts and sciences. And I began this particular class by presenting this slide of the basket in the making by this Hopi woman. And I said, "You see here uhm, a series of, of concentric circles with this vibrant blue at the center. Now, if I was to tell you that this Hopi woman indicated to me that she was recreating herself through the making of this basket, and I was to tell you that she saw each of these concentric circles as representing a different piece of herself, and further to share with you that she saw one of these circles as embodying, embodying herself, the next one her family, the third her community in which she grew up, the fourth, the world, particularly the physical world, the fauna and flora around her, and the fifth, the creator. Which do you think represents which aspect of herself? And I had a flurry of hands with the showing and I had a very assertive medical student said, "All of this is simple and I don't understand the instruction here." And I said, "Well, what do you think the answers are?" And he pointed at the center circle and he says that vibrant center piece, the blue is obviously herself ah, and the next ah, her family and the third, the, the purple one are the, the community and the uhm, the black ah, the world around her and so forth, and the, and the last the creator, embodying all. And I said, "Can I have a show of hands among you who feel the same way?" And it was unanimous. And I said, "We've just had a wonderful demonstration of reliability but lack of validity." And I said, "Because in fact, from this Hopi woman's point of view, that vibrant circle in the middle was the creator. And then outward from that was the, the world around her, her fa, her community, her family. And the outer circle represented herself, and that she saw herself as the synergistic collection of all of these elements not everything else surrounding her." And uhm, and that's in part what's at work with many American Indian Alaska Native students as we find our way across the institutions that our educational or social or that, that, that impact upon our life, is that we're struggling to retain that sense of self defined in that manner. And of course, the educational systems, particularly which within which we reside uhm, are very adept at dissembling ah, that sense of self than an attempt to reassemble who we are through a process of socialization ah, into a new discipline or into a new field or to, into a new career. I had colleagues uhm, and so the question then becomes, "How do we accomplish this?" Ah, now, well that's an easy question to articulate, that is, how do we make a difference with respect to all the way along the pipeline but particularly in my area of interest with respect to post-resident ah, I mean, to postdoctoral and to resident fellows. How do we make a difference in terms of their experiences constructively and the likelihood that they will persist in their academic careers and become the independent scientists of tomorrow so they can assume these major positions of leadership? Well, my life's work over the last 15 years has really been how to make that difference in my particular institution. And that institution is the School of Medicine at the University of Colorado. I'm located in the Department of Psychiatry, but our work spans on many different departments. And we've developed together with, in this particular case, my wife Dedra Buchwald, an internist and professor of Medicine at the University of Washington, a collaboration between our two respective institutions that has developed what we called the Native Investigative Development Program. And I'd like to spend just a couple of minutes sharing with you the structure and process of that program, but then spend even more time on the lessons that have been learned and the key points of success that I think try followed from that. So first, let me talk about some of the key features of this program. It's a two-year training period. And we uhm, recruit and support four native investigators, American Indian Alaskan Natives, who are M.D.'s or Ph.D.'s ah, into the program. And the program itself uhm, blends together targeted didactic instruction in very specic, specific areas of competency that are required ah, to persist academically and to achieve the ranks of success as a scientist specifically as an NIH-sponsored scientist, which is the coin of the realm in schools of medicine around the country. And we employ an extremely intensive monitoring ah, mentoring approach that I'll describe in a little bit ah, greater detail. And it's an approach that uhm, may have some familiar aspects to, of it to you, but it'll also have I think some unique and surprising aspects. And we have a highly interdisciplinary faculty. We have a faculty of ah, approx, a core faculty of approximately ten of us. We started out with four of us, who were senior, at associate or, as, or a full professor level. I was the only native faculty at the very beginning. And what we did is, is after every cohort graduated from the two-year program, we brought them in as core faculty, at least two of the four so that they would continue to be mentored and learn, in turn learn how to be mentored, ah, how to mentor in the successive cohorts. So, they weren't just, you know, su, as, ah, you know, uhm, encouraged to leave the nest entirely, but they were fostered, well, uhm, and fostered in turn, ah, other native investigators. I had a number of, ah, native investigators in the recent cohort. I'll be 58 in May and I'm, been a full professor for about 16 or 17 years and, and I had no begrudge in that. This, but they would say, this particular native investigator said, "Look, you, you're successful. You have 125, 150 publications, all these grants, and you're a full professor. How can you possibly know what I'm going through? How can you relate to the struggles that I experience now?" Ah, I can but it's one thing to tell to them that you can. It's another to show. And yet a, yet a third, to be able to have a faculty that bridges the time and, and developmental trajectories that, ah, interspace, inters, inter, inter, in, that, that fall between where that individual is at and where I'm at in our career. So it's a, it's a, it, it came as a no-brainer, if you will, to have the graduating, uhm, uhm, co, cohorts become teachers in turn with us for the new incoming cohorts. And we have an interdisciplinary faculty now of 20, uhm, 14 of whom are American Indian Alaskan natives representing 18 different disciplines among us, ah, totally. Ah, so, it's a highly diverse discipline, ah, set of disciplines that are available to these M.D.'s and Ph.D.'s. And I think that's consistent with the kinds of questions that face us today that the science, ah, that's undertaken today, uhm, wrestles with. And, that is, I don't think that the truth lies within any one discipline. And in, in fact, the truth really only becomes discoverable as we pull our resources and perspective and knowledge basis across many different kinds of discipline. And one needs to only look at the, uhm, most current questions today in the health-related fields, whether it be on the prevention and treatment of HIV, whether it be in the prevention of suicide, whether it be on combating, ah, substance abuse or, ah, reducing the stigma in mental illness in, ah, native communities, that these are not the, uhm, the singular, ah, efforts of one discipline, and that the answers to addressing the kinds of questions that emerged from these areas of interest really are, uhm, not, uhm, the, uhm, stuff of a single disciplinary field. The characteristics of the native investigators in our program include M.D., Ph.D. level social, ah, scientists, seven years or less postgraduate education, that American Indian Alaska Native, they have to have a commitment to a research career, ah, and an interest in native culture. I can't tell you how powerful it is in our didactic sessions, which I'll show you the structure of the program in a moment, to have 12 to 14 American Indian Alaska Native MD's and PhD's at various points in the learning process come together and mentor one another and to share lessons learned. The training components are fairly, ah, ah, traditional in terms of an introduction to native health. There are pilot studies, variety of different kinds. There are regular meetings, intensive and regular mentoring, ah, interactions that occur both and face-to-face, particularly telephonically and electronically by email. And we focus on the secondary analyses of existing data sets. We really are focused on identifying and conveying to the native investigators the critical essential skills that are necessary for them, ah, to become, ah, externally sponsored scientists. That includes not only how to craft an application, how to, uhm, conduct research, how to publish, but also how to present orally and in written fashion. So we introduce them to a variety of different kinds of seminars, ah, that are available around the country, and provide guidance as they go through those intensive experiences. We, ah, actually expose them to, ah, the editors of leading journals who come in for not only didactic but experiential sessions. And in mimic for them at the close of the two-year program a review of the grand applications that they have to prepare in terms of what's a mock initial review group, for which there are no external observers in, in the real world, but we provide them with a glimpse of what the process is like by reviewing in a very critical fashion mimicking what that experience is like, one that they can observe. Uhm, as I indicated, we have access to a variety of, of data sets or if that are available. They're not many, but include large a numbers of appropriately represented American Indian Alaskan natives. But we link them with those data sets, help them craft the nature of the questions they ask of them. The structure of the program itself is really, uhm, broken out into several streams of activity. During the first year of activity, it focuses on preparing and facilitating their secondary analyses and existing data sets. So they access these data sets. They develop mini proposals about the kinds of questions they're gonna ask of them. They go through initial review board, uhm, protocols, how to develop those protocols. They get travel review and approval as appropriate. And then, they engage in the analyses. And as a product of this first year of pilot project of secondary analysis is a publication that's reviewed, ah, constantly by the mentors, ah, as a team, as well as subject to, ah, review by, ah, in the didactic and experiential sessions with the editors from these leading, ah, journals. Uhm, midway through the first year, they, uhm, begin to focus on what will constitute a primary data collection project. So that the focus on the second year is actually going out, getting their hands dirty, and collecting data. Most of them have never actually gone out into communities or into clinical settings and collected data. And it's there too. It's crafting a mini proposal just to find a budget of up to 10 to 15,000 dollars that will be awarded to them to conduct the work of actually, uhm, preparing proposals for tribes, ah, having them reviewed, having them approved often after multiple iterations. And throughout this process, we have an average of six to seven face-to-face two to three-day sessions each in Denver, Colorado or Seattle, Washington, where the native investigators come together with the core faculty, with interspersed mentoring, telephonically and electronically, in between those two to three-day sessions. And, ah, and the second, uhm, year, it has similarly, ah, equal number of face-to-face sessions. We have a distributive rather than a centralized focus. One of the reasons we're very clear now after 12 years of experience in this program, why past training programs of this nature did not succeed, is because these programs typically require the fellows or the postdoctoral fellows to uproot from their homes and their home institutions that come to a central place, where they lose the support of family. They get out of step in synchrony with the institutions within which they arri, they are, uhm, reside. And, so, we keep them placed in their home institutions, but we subcontract for a third of their time, and so that we have explicit claim on the, ah, time and energy needed, ah, at their home institutions to participate and to fill the expectations around our particular effort. So, to date, what are the outcomes? To date, we've graduated 23 American Indian Alaskan Native MD's and PhD's. This is at the set of 12 years. We've had an 86 percent retention rate. We've had very few dropouts, dropouts. And the dropouts we've had had largely been, ah, due to family crises or health crises. We now have six of these 23 individuals attending the major institutions across the country. They themselves are principal investigators acquiring over $42 million to date of NIH grants. In 2004, NIH released a new report indicating that there are 26 principal investigators or American Indian Alaska Native, ah, maybe and a good number of those, ah, emanate the missed particular program. And you can see here the number of different kinds of grants they have received and have published well over now, 120 pre-reviewed articles, so making an impact on the knowledge reflected on many of the archives where this knowledge is often found. So what are some of the key successes? Well, clearly, ah, a history of a high quality broad-based relevant research, ah, is really critical to this effort, and so that it is able to speak to the, uhm, wide spectrum of interest on part of the native investigator. It has to be a stable and active research program with strong institutional support and involvement. A critical mass of experienced investigators had a variety of levels of preparation who can share their experiences and their disciplinary perspectives. And we firmly believe, that has to be distributed as opposed to centralized. We have now a large number of Indian and Native role models to scientists available, who have, ah, experience and have credentials, ah, and can ex, and it can convey to the younger colleagues what the nature of ex, their experiences were in the acquisition of the coins to the realm if you will. But more in terms of the process, the program has really focused on promoting self reflection, perspective taking and how to be a constructive critic, really critic, really important because criticism is painful, often personalized by many of these individuals, by most of us in the field. And the extent to which you personalize that criticism is likely to lead to, ah, your disengagement because of the pain and embarrassment, ah, anger and frustration that it frequently generates. We focused on insuring adequate preparation in terms of, of scientific, uhm, process and methods. And we do that in concrete and personal, in meaningful and relevant terms. We'd ground it, ah, in ways that the native investigators can immediately relate to. We emphasize writing skills and then maximize opportunities to learn how to write. Writing is like riding a bike. You have to it, you have to do it frequently. Many of the young investigators don't believe, ah, that it's possible to learn how write well. They look at, ah, senior colleagues and they think it's sort of a God given skill that we somehow acquired, ah, in some unknown fashion. Well, I'm here to tell you after 30 years of practice, you're likely to get pretty good at it. And, ah, so, it, it's a teachable skill and moving them past the assumption that it's not a skill that they'll likely to learn. One of the things that the program emphasizes is providing clarity and extensive structure regarding the expectations around short as well as the long term goals. It's very goal oriented, and it's goal oriented in terms of blueprints for success in their respected institutions, teaches them how to discover those blueprints for success, what the major benchmarks along the journey is along the, the, the roadmap to success. It stresses deadlines and accountability and especially the context that the interlocked nature of these deadlines and accountability that if you haven't completed your task, I can't help you move forward and not, your lack of ability to move forward reflects poorly on me as a mentor. So you have an obligation to me just as I have an obligation to you. And your ability to complete tasks on time relates to the group nature of the training endeavor and so that your peers, as other Native investigators are thwarted in terms of advancing their, uhm, educational process to the extent that you are unable to deliver on your expectations. We underscore the efficiency and, and time management. We actually have frequent workshops on time management. We turn off the "ding" on the, ah, incoming e-mail notification. We teach people how to file. We teach them how to, ah, prioritize, to identify the importance of, ah, priorities, that just what is presented as urgent from someone else may not necessarily be urgent, ah, for your particular purposes and how to acquire these very basic and learnable skills. We did mystify the grantsmanship process. It's like a black box, ah, and, but you can go inside of it. And you can deconstruct that experience and teach them how to compete successfully, with help into restructure or threatening and discouraging the circumstances as challenges or opportunities. For example, nearly 30 years ago, one of the first articles I ever submitted for review to a pre-reviewed journal came back, ah, with one of the reviewer's comments as, as following, began, I assumed it was a "he," it had a very male overtone to it. He said, "Upon reading the title in the abstract of this particular submission, I was thrilled. I expected to be treated to a fine glass of red wine that had, ah, you know, developed a wonderful bouquet. Well, unfortunately as I got deeper into the article, I found instead I had been presented with a glass, amazing jar of lukewarm dishwater." 

00:35:05
 Oh. 

00:35:05
SPERO MANSON Now, obviously, you know, in the face of that criticism, what is your first, your first initial reaction? One of shame, embarrassment, ultimately anger, frustration and you're likely to disengage in the process. Why do I need that kind of feedback with respect to, ah, this particular endeavor? Why should I engage in a journey, a professional and a career journey that's likely to have further kinds of experiences of that nature? So, one of the things we work on is, is, is developing a sense of constructive criticism of demystifying the process of finding different dift, distance around those kinds of, of criticisms and how to turn those circumstances from rather than threats into positive challenging circumstances so that, you know, "I wanna prove you wrong. I'm gonna not discount you have to say. I'm gonna analyze carefully what's been said by the peer reviewer and I'm going to address those critiques as best I can. And I will prove that in fact, this person, ah, did not know his or her wines." We prepare them for the realities in doing community-based research and partnerships. These are complicated, ah, difficult relationships that are in greater demand, ah, especially for those of us who work with our respective communities. These delayed productivity, these are frustrating frequently. These present new challenges on how to translate from one world to the next. We offer strategies for how to outreach and disseminate your findings that disseminating your finding as a peer-reviewed scientific article is just one of a variety of audiences that you need to reach, that you have an obligation and in fact a fascinating professional challenge in figuring how to translate your work into meaningful terms at the local level. And ultimately, how to carry your work beyond simply that reporting of it scientifically but into advocacy. One of the most successful professional experiences I've ever had was testifying for Congress on five or six occasions that lead, ah, to the translation of findings around, uhm, the use of traditional medicine among a southwestern tribe in the, ah, attempt on the part of combat veterans from that tribe to deal with the many stresses that they have experienced both, uhm, during, ah, in military experience in Vietnam as well as afterwards. And the result being in April of 1998, that was Viet Memorandum of Agreement between the Veterans administration and that tribe signed so that the VA now reimburses, ah, ah, any one of up to 13 tribal ceremonies, ah, and pays for those ceremonies, and now does so in over 30 native communities around the country, and you can trace that back to that work. And I think that that's an important expectation that now, a balance in native communities about your, your permanence, the nature of the relationship and what, ah, impacts that work is likely to have. Lastly, one of the messages is about mentoring and education itself that is a lifelong process. I'm reminded of whenever I would go to one of our family reunions, I'm the eldest of, ah, 76 grandchildren in my father's mother on that si, in the native side of the family. And, ah, I'm only one, ah, ah, only two of, half of us finished high school. Two of us went on to any kind of post secondary education. I'm the only one to finish, ah, on baccalaureate much less, a masters or a doctorate. Whenever I was there, the family reunion, our home and it was frequent. And my grandmother had died just, ah, reached short of her hundredth birthday about seven years ago. I would have an auntie or an, or an uncle say (inaudible ) is the Anishinaabe for chipmunk because I chattered then as I chattered now. And I think that was really great preparation for an academic critter. And that they said, "(inaudible ), what are you doing?" And I said, "I'm in school." "Coz so, you know, you're still going to school." And this went on, you know, a long time going on for a doctorate. And finally it must have been about 10 or 12 years later, the same auntie said, "(inaudible ), what are you doing?" "Ah, ah, ah, I'm still going to school." And she says, "Won't they let you out?" (laughing) Ah, ah, you know, "Can't you pass?" And my grandmother sort of like battered around, and she said, "You leave him alone, I'm a student, too. I'm a student of life." And it underscores the fact that mentoring is a two-way street and that you constantly learn. And it's one of the vital aspects of mentoring from my point of view. I constantly learn new, new lessons and that, that is, as much a reward as it is an obligation. Uhm, we have some publications, ah, ab, about our work that are available, that I'll, ah, gladly share with you, to describe the structuring process. I have an article coming out in American Journal of Public Health in a couple of months that talks about the conceptual framework for this, you know? We have very little in the way of conceptual frameworks available to us that guide, ah, this kind of preparation at the postdoctoral and postresidency level. Ironically, we have been very rich and vital, ah, intellectual tradition at the, uhm, undergraduate level with respect to underrepresented minorities theoretically and conceptually, but not so at the, ah, postdoctoral and postresidency level. So, one of the things we do, and this is the picture of the first cohort, uhm, 12 years ago is we create a sense of family, a sense of community. And each of these people, uhm, Dr. Roubideaux on the far left, doctor, ah, Jeff Henderson on the upper top who's getting married to, to one of the native investigators in the second cohort, Dr. Patricia Nez Henderson, and Dr. Dorothy Rhoades, ah, in the first cohort. We sense, we, ah, we, we, we, we work to build a sense of family and community and so that we now have, ah, four marriages that are attributable to the native investigator development program. And we have three children, offspring of those marriages, that we are grooming or perhaps in another 25 years will be members themselves in the native investigator development program. So I'm here to convey to you a little sense of optimism about the possible, ah, with respect to, ah, increasing the representation, especially of American Indian Alaska Natives in the roles of scientific leadership in this country as represented, ah, in this particular fashion. And I think that these lessons learned apply across all of our, ah, respective groups, and they are not specific just to American Indian Alaska Natives. Thank you.
