00:00:10
RICH SIMON Welcome, everyone. This is Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker, and this, what we're talking about today is the question of men in psychotherapy. We have a somewhat paradoxical situation in our field where we have a uh, a field where, uh, for the most part, practitioners, increasingly, are female, and at the same time we have this, we have a male clientele who, uh, at the same time, are acknowledging that perhaps the, some of our methods, some of our assumptions, our techniques, are not as male-friendly as they might be, and we're very fortunate today to have as our guest someone who's an expert in this whole question of male psychology and women treating me, so let me welcome today's guest Holly Sweet. Holly, how are you? 

00:01:05
HOLLY SWEET Good. How are you? 

00:01:10
RICH SIMON (ph)Okay. So let's, let's start off what you're gonna talk about: two aspects of this issue of men and in therapy. One is the kind of the border question of men in therapy, particularly when women are, uh, therapists with them, and then we wanna get to in a little bit about this, the specific challenges of working with men and depressions. So to, to start off is . . . This was uh, has been, at different times, there's been, uh, less than unanimous con-, uh, agreement about the question of whether there's a real difference between the issues of working with men and women in psychotherapy, so what's your own view of that question? 

00:01:50
HOLLY SWEET Well, there's, I think there's clearly a difference in the way men and women are socialized in our culture, and I think there's really a difference in male norms and female norms and they translate into men having a harder time recognizing what they're going through and seeking the help and trusting the process. I think male norms, I don't think anyone can disagree that male norms in this culture differ from female norms. Are men and women inherently different? I don't know, you know, but who . . . And . . . 

00:02:20
RICH SIMON It's tricky. 

00:02:20
HOLLY SWEET I think it's more the normative peace, and I think what happens is that because psychology of men isn't taught in graduate schools, you know, and psychology of gender is typically psychology of women. Women enter the workplace, working with men, having no idea about the socialization of men. They don't really get it, and I think, because our socialization is different, we're socialized to connect, to show vulnerable feelings, to be, you know, a little more, uh, connected, receptive, um, it's, it's harder for us to get that men who come into our therapy offices may be already feeling one down. They've come in, they're first of all asking for help - that's not part of their male norms - they're saying, "I have a problem," which means, and they're emotionally vulnerable - that's not part of the male norm of normative structure - and they're coming in to say, "I need something from you," so they're already one down in their own eyes, and I think that we women really have to acknowledge - and I think it's important to do it from the get-go - that it takes courage for men to come into therapy in a different way than it does women. I think women also have trouble getting into . . . I also think it's ironic that you're asking people who have damaged relationships to come into your office and trust you. It's like, why should they trust you? This process . . . You've come into a room and, and you, here you are. You close the door and, and say, "Tell me all about yourself and tell me every, everything that's going on and, and trust me." Why should they trust us? And so I think to gain their trust and really to help them trust the process is huge and very important. 

00:03:50
RICH SIMON So, so let's, let's just . . . When, when you were in . . . Let's (ph)kind of a thought experiment here. It's the first session and it's a session with, uh, a guy is coming in, and um, uh, what would you say, in terms of it as you, as you think about that first session, uh, as opposed to a first session with a female client? Is there something about that basic dynamic in a kind of, that uh, very immediate sense? You have something with the woman's coming in, you have the socialization experience in common, a guy, there's the gender divide . . . Talk to us a little bit about how you adapt, kind of what you find yourself just sort of automatically adapting to do in this kind of situation. 

00:04:35
HOLLY SWEET I think what I do is I become much more real. I'm a, I'm a fairly real clinician. I don't have a huge persona as, you know . . . But I think I'm much more likely I have a firm handshake, I come on in, you know, I've used his first name, "Did you have trouble getting here?", um, you know, at the waiting room I make sure it's not filled with, you know, girly magazines, female arrangements . . . 

00:05:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:05:00
HOLLY SWEET Well, girly magazines might be useful, but something that makes them feel like this is a place they can belong, this is a place . . . Um, I kind of make it a little more straightforward, common sense, I'm the auto mechanic, he's got a broken down engine, I'm here to fix the, help him fix the engine. Uh, it's kind of more common sense and I'm a little bit less of "Tell me how you feel," a little more sort of education. I do more psycho-ed, even the first session; you know, "Here's what we might expect, here's what I, how I work," I have more of a CBT approach, so we . . . You know, I say in the first session to expect this, so it's a little more psycho-ed than it is intense "Tell me how you feel. Let's form a relationship." I think that he, he has to feel comfortable to come back the next session. He has to have hope and he has to feel that he's not emasculated by who I am, so I do, um, I'm just very down to earth, and I make it, you know, I have a cup of coffee, I drink a cup, you know, so it feels more like a conversation and maybe it's a classroom than it is, you know, scary. And it's also . . . I'm aware of that. We come in, I shut the door, we're close . . . You know? I remember the first session. I was in a room with the door I had to lock to shut it and our knees are about two inches apart, and I said to the guy, "Well, let's get to know each other," and he said, "Why would I want to get to know you?" And he never came back, so . . . And he was clearly very depressed, going through a divorce, but the setting is important. It has to feel, um, not particularly therapeutic. I think it has to feel a little bit more casual, a little bit more like coming in for a doctor's appointment or a car mechanic. (crosstalk)It doesn't mean I don't do therapeutic work, but it (crosstalk)feels a little more, like real, a real setting. 

00:06:40
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)Yeah. All right, so it's clearly . . . So that's a real marker for you, (crosstalk)male, male client, and you're, and you're, of course, you're ready to receive the person, whatever else happens, but you have certain ideas, certain beginning assumptions, at least, about how to (crosstalk)(inaudible ) . . . 

00:06:56
HOLLY SWEET (crosstalk)Yes, yes. (crosstalk)Yes, and, and I make sure by the end of the session, that first session . . . And, as you know, first sessions are crucial, especially with male clients, cuz they're already skittish, I think, about coming in. You have to leave them with a sense of hope and you have to leave them with a sense of, almost, pride, or, or a sense that . . . And I know David Wexler's talked about this: you don't wanna shame, you don't wanna make the guy feel worse, that "I'm more of a loser," right? He already feels like a loser, especially if he's depressed. You wanna make him feel kind of proud of himself for taking that step, so, and I don't do that with women as much. I don't feel the need to say, "Wow, you're really brave to come in here" . . . 

00:07:30
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:07:30
HOLLY SWEET . . . but I do do that with men and I do it very consciously because I think they're overcoming more obstacles in coming in, and I think women therapists don't always get that. 

00:07:40
RICH SIMON So when you . . . Elsewhere in this series, we spoke to David about this and I, I asked him the same question about this uh, women feel shame, just as men do. What's your notion about what's is there, what's the difference? What's distinctive about the nature of the shame that a, a male client might feel coming into your office, as opposed to the . . . 

00:08:05
HOLLY SWEET Because the, when you think of - and Rich, you, you may, as a man, you probably have gone through this yourself - some of the key norms that I understand men to go through are you've gotta be strong, you can't be crying in front of people, you can't be, you know, you can't be dependent, you've gotta be independent, strong, the Marlboro Man, stoic, and I think that women don't have that same thing. We, our socialization is connect, connect, connect, you know, and show feelings. I don't feel (ph)unfeminine when I cry; I don't feel unfeminine for asking for help. I think you guys do more because that's how you're trained, and you see it all over the place in, in the real world; "Oh my God, he's breaking down! He's shedding a tear!" You know? So I think that that is really a difference, and I think, if a man's depressed, it's even a double whammy, because not only is he coming in for help, but he already feels emasculated because, when you're depressed, you feel powerless, you feel helpless, you feel, uh, you know, pushed under, and that's very, I think, harder for men because the norms for men say, you know, "You've gotta be uh, strong," you know? So I'm just careful the first session to always end it with something with positive. "Thank you for coming in." I says, "This is," you know, "you're (ph)signing, you're taking responsibility," kind of appealing to the hero sort of. You're coming and not . . . You're, you know, you're so depressed. "God . . ." You know? Who . . . But . . . And I'm also aware - this is another difference - that when I, a man comes into my room and I shut the door and at the end, he pays me, right, he talks about intimate things and then he pays me, cuz I have pay as you go, and it has a different flavor than it is with a female. This is for straight men and I'm a straight woman and I'm aware of . . . So I'm careful . . . In general, I don't . . . I, I, I, I, I think there's, often, a sexual transference there because men are starved for connection. Often time, if they're depressed, they may not be talking to anybody. So they're coming in behind closed doors, giving me to, to do what? To be intimate. So I just have to be careful how that intimacy is, is viewed. 

00:10:05
RICH SIMON So stay with that (crosstalk)for a second. 

00:10:05
HOLLY SWEET (crosstalk)And I, and I don't think men (crosstalk)(ph)and female therapists think about that with men. 

00:10:10
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)That's pretty provocative. Yeah. No, no, that's great, and, and you, and you were, in your Networker piece, I, I thought you were really, it was really terrific where you . . . 

00:10:15
HOLLY SWEET And that's (crosstalk)especially 

00:10:20
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)That's the first time I heard anybody dis-, really discuss that really in, in (crosstalk)(inaudible ) . . . 

00:10:24
HOLLY SWEET (crosstalk)And that's really, I have to say, particularly true, cuz I think that the people I'm working with now are younger female clinicians, and they are . . . When . . . If you're a 25 year old, new female clinician working with a 45 year old man and you're an attractive female and the man's going through divorce and he's starved for attention and connection, it's hard, and I think . . . The females say to me, "What if he has sexual transference to me?", and I say, "What if he does? This is, you know, grounds for therapy. This is . . . Don't be scared of it, don't be, but don't, don't encourage either. Don't dress like Jennifer Melfi. (crosstalk)Remember how she would wear those short skirts with Tony Soprano, like, in the motel room? I mean . . . So, it's just (crosstalk)something to think about. 

00:11:00
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Uh-huh. (crosstalk)So stay, stay with this cuz this seems like a, uh . . . This . . . We'll, we'll get to this discussion of uh, depression in a moment. So, and so there's a - first of all, of course, in this work - there's awareness, so what else, when you're supervising, uh, a young woman or any woman that, with a, with um, who's working with men and with your awareness of this dynamic, what is the, what's the kinds of . . . How do you try to be helpful with them in addition to the awareness of these issues? 

00:11:30
HOLLY SWEET I think . . . You know, I've talked to a number of female graduate students who are sort of starting out, and the things they say to me that are troubling to them, they say two things, three things kind of consistently: they're afraid of the erotic transference, and I say, "What about your counter-transference?" and "Let's not be scared of it," right? Second: um, they say, "I, I'm afraid of angry men." And so what I do is I said, "Let's talk about what scares you. What scares you about an angry man? What's your experience? Because a man, if he comes in, and, often, anger is depression turned, uh, depression is anger turned inwards, right? So you wanna maybe get at the anger. You don't want the man to feel that you're scared of him, unless he's, you know, got a gun. But I think that women have to be trained not to be afraid of men and I'm always shocked at how many women are actually afraid of men on some level, especially the big, the 6'4" guy that comes in and you're 5'2" and you're 26 and he's 46 and . . . But he's, he's a human being. He, he's hurting, and so I talk to them about look for the hurt, look for the pain. Don't worry about the anger. And, and the third thing is that they say to me, "How can I understand men? I'm not a man. I haven't gone through this." And they say, men will say to me, "You're not gonna get it. You're a female," and I, my response is, ask them, say "You're right, and I'd like to learn more," and I think that that piece of accepting them and saying, "I wanna learn more" . . . I think men are starved in this culture for a chance to really connect on an intimate level, and they tend to sexualize it, but the real intimacy - and with, certainly in therapy - is gonna be uh, uh, uh, an emotional one, uh, and I think to welt a man in by saying, "Tell me more" and not being afraid, making them feel comfortable and letting him feel like, in some ways, this is a place he can be safe, because I think a lot of men don't feel safe in this world. I mean, I think there's real, you know . . . Don't feel safe from other men, don't feel judged by women, feel, um, judged of being, you know, bullied or being a wimp or . . . And I think that you wanna make therapy really safe for them, and I don't think female therapists often get that men feel unsafe or feel disconnected, and I think it's really important to acknowledge that, to understand that, so I (crosstalk)just work with them around "Don't be afraid", you know, ask, ask about his experience and don't wear really short skirts and low-cut blouses cuz there already will be, probably, some sexual transference, and that's fine. 

00:13:55
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)So . . . So this is such uh, a interesting topic, cuz there's so little discussion of, what would seem to me, a very common experience in that therapy when you have - I'm sure it works both ways - but for the moment, let's focus on the female therapist. There's the guy. Maybe he's going through a divorce, all the different kinds of permutations of where someone is in their life and he has a crush, an unacknowledged crush, on the female therapist and it's there in the room and you, the, the, the therapist is aware of it, so in addition to an awareness of what's going on, what, how do you help your supervisees? What have you, as a practitioner, learned that what are effective ways to make sure that doesn't get in the way of the therapy relationship and enha-, in fact, perhaps, enhances what can go on in therapy? 

00:14:55
HOLLY SWEET Yep, this is actually, I think, a fairly common problem, and it's a shame it's not talked about more. I think one thing is you don't wanna ignore it, and I, I've heard make comments, you know, a variety, from, "Wow, you look really nice today," to "You wanna go out?" I mean, I . . . It hasn't happened to me, but some of my younger colleagues, a guy actually asked them out . . . 

00:15:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:15:15
HOLLY SWEET . . . and the one thing you don't wanna do is you don't wanna shame them, right? Absolutely do not wanna shame them. You want to acknowledge the, that, that you're flattered by the, you know, or something that, that's nice, and you also wanna specify what the therapy relationship is about, that you wanna make sure they know the parameters of it, and then you'll also wanna say, "And, given that this is going on, let's take a look and see, you know, what is it about, you know, this relationship. What . . ." You know? "Is this familiar? Where has this happened in the past?" You wanna use . . . Uh, therapy's kind of a laboratory for a healthy male-female relationship that's about non-sexual intimacy, so you don't . . . You wanna . . . I think so many men sexualize things because they really wanna be close, and that's how they know how to be . . . 

00:16:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:16:00
HOLLY SWEET . . . and I think you don't wanna shame them, but you wanna educate them that there are other ways to be close and that therapy also is a, a different kind of experience. It's a safe place to show your feelings, to kind of work things out, but the therapist is not a date, but . . . 

00:16:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:16:15
HOLLY SWEET . . . and, and they . . . But it's a laboratory. It's a place that you can safely kind of express things, so I think it's you wanna acknowledge it, you wanna say, you know, in a nice way, "Thank you," and, "Here's what therapy is about" and "Can we use this to, to help you understand the issues in your life? Is there something we can learn from this?" 

00:16:35
RICH SIMON Okay. All right. So, so let's shift a little bit and let's, let's get to our, the, the advertised theme for our conversation about men in depression. So le-, let's start off. Do men and women manifest their depression differently? 

00:16:55
HOLLY SWEET I think they do, absolutely. I think the DSM-IV R has a list of symptoms. I think that, often, men don't show those symptoms. (ph)Dale Pollack has written about what he calls the depressive disorder male type and that men are more likely to show different kinds of symptoms than tearfulness then open, openly saying, "I'm depressed." They're more likely to somaticize; they're more likely to withdraw; they're more likely to show anger; they're more likely to, um, get immersed in, in drugs, to turn to substance abuse; they're more likely to become work-a-holics. They won't be, they won't present as tearful. They won't say they're depressed, so you have to kind of guess at it and I think that any clinicianist working with depressed men should go . . . You can just look it up, Google it, you know, "Dale Pollack depression disorder male type," or I can, e-mail me and I'll send you it. It's really helpful cuz it helps you realize that men, because of their socialization, will present the depression in different ways. The one thing they're not likely to do is to cry in your office and they're not gonna say they're depressed as clearly as women will, so . . . And they are . . .Cuz self- report is a big part of what you get in the therapy office. It's also helpful to bring in a significant other to have them see what's going on and get their feedback, but I think it's important to realize that things like withdrawal, like anger, like substance abuse . . . I'm convinced that a lot of substance abusers have dual diagnosis and they're really depressed and the depression's actually fueling the substance abuse, but we treat the substance abuse. We see that cuz that's kind of a more manly thing to do than to be depressed; "Real men drink." But, you know, I think it's important to, to understand that men may present in different ways, so I'm always on, I always kind of look for that with my male clients. Now, maybe they don't have it, but I always am careful to look for it because if it goes untreated it's really problematic, so . . . 

00:18:50
RICH SIMON So where . . . How do you . . . So then where you . . . When . . . So the guy is not presenting himself in your office as depressed but he's, he's presenting the symptoms that you've been describing, so how do ya, whereas uh, your female clients, from what you're saying, it's more likely they're coming, "Hey, I'm really feeling depressed. I'm feeling so sad. I feel so hopeless about things". It's a more direct presentation of their inner state? (crosstalk)So when the guy . . . How do, how is it that . . . So how do you deal with the, the, the ma-, the way the men present and how do you then get them, how do you begin the therapy with people who are not saying "I'm here cuz I'm depressed."? 

00:19:30
HOLLY SWEET (crosstalk)Yes, that's correct. I think it, it's sort of how I start any therapy session. In the first session, I always have the miracle question, which is if a miracle happened and you woke up tomorrow and things were just the way you wanted, what would be different? And what I'm looking for is does he have a sense of powerlessness and does he feel disconnected, and I think that men who are feeling disconnected is, it's a huge piece of depression, and if they don't have strong connections or if they feel really fatigued and there's no medical reasons for it that's kind of a warning sign. If a guys talks about being fatigued, of course, I have him go to his primary care physician, cuz we don't wanna confuse, you know, a thyroid disorder with depression, but I think in the miracle question it gives me a chance to find out what he's looking for, and also, I always ask in the first session, uh, what, what's working in your life, what's working well. I don't know how many clinicians do this, but I think it's important to ask what's working well cuz if someone's depressed, you don't wanna have them leave the session going "Ugh!", you know, and if they're, and I'm looking for what, is he connected, is he doing a job that he likes, does he feel, like, a sense of control and power in life, and if he feels powerless, if there's been a recent loss, any of the sort of stress factors that I would think would contribute to depression, I'm more alert to . . . And I can't necessarily diagnose it the first session, but I am paying attention to life factors like loss. I think loss is a huge one. If a guy's retiring, if he's gotten fired, if he's gotten laid off, if his wife has left him, if his girlfriend has left him - these are big factors - his health, he's gotten prostate cancer, or he's . . . You know, whatever, I think these are things that could lead to depression more likely in men than women - I'll go out on a limb here - because I think women have a better network system to process it and it doesn't go directly against their norms. If I get (ph)second (ph)need help if I lost my job - okay - I get to, you know, go out and, I don't know what, I don't feel unfeminine cuz I've lost my job, but I think a man feels unmasculine so those loss factors are huge, and so I look for that as, as sort of a diagnostic factor. 

00:21:40
RICH SIMON So when you're, as you're doing your initial assessment you're getting a sense of what's going on in someone's life, you're getting their life picture, you're finding out what's working in their life as well as what's not, what they're looking, what the answer to the miracle question is, is, as far as using the term depression yourself, and is, is it, is it helpful? Do you find yourself us-, telling your male clients who might never, would not go near that term in a thousand years, that they're depressed? How do you handle this question of what label are you as an (crosstalk)(inaudible ) . . . 

00:22:17
HOLLY SWEET (crosstalk)That's actually, yeah, that's a good question. I - maybe again I'm a little unusual - always work my clients around the diagnosis. I've had clients say to me they had no idea what diagnosis their clin-, their previous clinician gave them, and I think that's kind of crazy, cuz I think . . . So I will actually pull out the DSM-IV R and I'll pull out (ph)bill (ph)polished checklist and I'll say, "Check what (ph)feels applies to you," especially (ph)Bill Pollak's checklist, so they'd go "check, check, check," and I'll go, "Well, according to this, it looks like you might have depression. What do you think?" 

00:22:45
RICH SIMON Oh, okay. 

00:22:45
HOLLY SWEET And then I explain, I do a little psycho-ed piece around what depression might be and part of that psycho-ed piece is it's a disease, you're, it's not a moral defect, it's treatable, it's treatable by, you know, things like therapy and exercise and medication and, you know, various techniques and, but I just get the facts out there. I get the book, the paper, and I think it's easier than this kind of vague "What, what is depression?" So if they kind of see that checklist . . . 

00:23:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:23:10
HOLLY SWEET . . . they go, "Oh, that's depression? Okay." 

00:23:15
RICH SIMON Okay, yeah. 

00:23:15
HOLLY SWEET And then I have the, I have, sort of, it's not just something I've made up. I also ask them is this a diagnosis you're comfortable me sending into the insurance company and if it, if it isn't then I do an adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features for awhile until I'm sure, cuz I don't want it to go on his record if he's not saying, "Yeah." I also get the Beck Depression Inventory. You're familiar with that, right? 

00:23:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:23:40
HOLLY SWEET The Beck . . . Very common test. It's a 20-question checklist and, again, he just gets to check it and I'll say, "What do you think?" and I do a collaborative piece. That's the other thing: it's very "What do you think? Here's a test. (crosstalk)What do you think?" 

00:23:50
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)"What do you think? Yeah, (crosstalk)yeah. 

00:23:50
HOLLY SWEET (crosstalk)And then he'll turn to me. "Well, doc, you're the expert," and I'll say, "Well, in my opinion, you probably are depressed but let's think about that," and maybe I'll give 'em some homework to go home and read about it; you know, Terry Real's book I Don't Wanna Talk About It is excellent, you know, I'll give 'em, I'll say, you know, "Take a look at this. I think the author himself was depressed and look how successful he was," and I also wanna make sure if he gets the label or diagnosis to talk about so many men who are depressed who are now high-functioning, high-flyers, and there's a whole slew of them, right? And, you know, people come out and said, "I'm depressed and I'm," you know, "I'm doing great," so, you know, and also there are levels of depression, so he's gotta realize that the term depression doesn't mean he's gonna off himself. It means he often just feels that great cloud over his head or he feels he doesn't have much energy and so it doesn't have to be "I'm gonna kill myself." There's many (crosstalk)levels of depression, so we (crosstalk)do (ph)a (ph)little psycho-ed piece. 

00:24:45
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Sure. (crosstalk)Well . . . And what, and what's coming across also is, so you're demystifying it . . . 

00:24:50
HOLLY SWEET Yes, correct. 

00:24:50
RICH SIMON . . . you're, you're taking s-, something that has all kinds of as-, different associations for people, you're being very clear with people, and this, that's, that's interesting, the use of these different instruments to make it something that can be talked about, given a little bit of a structure (crosstalk)(ph)of, quantified . . . 

00:25:05
HOLLY SWEET Quantified, and quantify, which, you know, (crosstalk)we can see, "Okay, in, in six weeks you've gone from a 30 in the BDI to 15," you know, and so I think that men like the quantifiable cuz it gives them some sense of control. (crosstalk)It's not just a talking piece between you and me, and I don't have all the power and you're the weak puppy. We've got an instrument, so it's factual, it's scientific, it's . . . 

00:25:25
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Sure. Uh-huh. 

00:25:25
HOLLY SWEET You know? And so . . . 

00:25:30
RICH SIMON So here's interesting . . . So, in contrast with your female clients, is, do you find yourself less of the time, perhaps, using these instruments, uh, approaching this question of diagnosis in a somewhat different way? 

00:25:45
HOLLY SWEET No, I think I usually use the BDI. I think it's just something to, that that's a good . . . If I suspect depression, I, I, I j-, (crosstalk)I think it's a kind of a, Beck Depression Inventory is, or you know, there's other, uh, tests, but that's (crosstalk)uh, a good short one. 

00:26:00
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)The BDI being (ph)the (ph)accurate question . . . (crosstalk)(inaudible) Yeah. 

00:26:00
HOLLY SWEET Yeah, that, that um . . . But I think it, I think that men, I think that women wo-, worry, care about it less - that's my impression - they don't kind of focus on it as much. I think the men kind of like it cuz it's external, it's out there, it's quantifiable. I do it with anybody I think is depressed, cuz I think it's a good benchmark . . . 

00:26:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:26:20
HOLLY SWEET . . . cuz one of the problems with depression is that it, anybody, male or female, feels kind of lost in this fog of whatever and it's, it's good to have them have benchmarks, quantifiable things, keeping mood logs, keeping, you know, something where they can put it down on paper, and I think it's good for both men cuz when you put it down on paper it externalizes it and then it's also quantifiable. 

00:26:45
RICH SIMON Hm, okay. (crosstalk)So . . . 

00:26:45
HOLLY SWEET (crosstalk)So you're a six today and you were a five yesterday, you (crosstalk)know? 

00:26:50
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay, all right. I, I, I can relate to that. So, uh, so if, if, so we're talking about this first phase of treatment and people coming in with all the amorphous issues that people come into therapy with and this process of how do we define it as depression or not, so when you, to take a step back, and if you look at the treatment process, what you're, what you wind up doing with your, uh, your male clients who are, are depressed and your women clients, how would you compare what the, beyond that initial phase, what the treatment process is like. Are they, are the processes distinctively different between the . . . 

00:27:30
HOLLY SWEET Yeah, I, I think, and I've learned from, from error, so I'll give an example of when I think I made a mistake. A guy came in. He was actually traumatized from early childhood stuff. He had both depression and anxiety. He'd (ph)led with anxiety but clearly had depression, and I kinda took a can opener and opened him up, you know, and emotions were flowing and he was crying and then, the next thing I know, he's not coming back, and I'm thinking if he's opening up, "Yay! This is great!" and he's thinking "I'm really terrified, because for me to open up means I'm vulnerable, means I'm gonna get hurt and I think that, again - and he was uh, from Germany, you know, so the kind of German male norms are probably even more strict than America - and I think that it was just very painful for him and I was seeing it as, "Whoa, we're making progress," forgetting about the role of shame, forgetting about the fear, forgetting about all that stuff, just saying, "Great. We're connecting. He's opening up to me." I think with women that's less likely to happen because, again, they don't, when they open up, they're less, it doesn't bump up against the norms, so I think that was an example I learned from that, and now I'm a little more careful to not diagnose depression right away. I take my time, um, help him feel comfortable. When he says he's not comfortable talking about things, don't go kind of poking around where I'm not wanted. Keep it on the, maybe, a little bit more superficial, but I do the psycho-ed piece and this, I have a client, a young client I'm working with now who's, I think, but he doesn't wanna talk about it. He talks about anxiety and, recently, um, he's come in saying, you know, I was doing a CBT approach. It was homework; he couldn't get the homework done. We talked about that and he came in last session and said, "I, you know, I think I might actually be a little depressed", and I went, "Oh," you know, because he, then, was ready to acknowledge it. He, he had spent time, he trusted me . . . I think just having every s-, a session a week . . . I think we can't underestimate the importance of those weekly sessions where we're there to listen, not judge, um, be kind, not push them too hard, um, but that there, it took him a long time and I, you know, a female client, I think they get there a little faster. 

00:29:40
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay, so the (ph)pacing is different, in your experience. 

00:29:40
HOLLY SWEET (crosstalk)They'll get there maybe second session. There's also the sexual transference and counter-transference. This guy's 25; I'm not, but, you know, it's still about he, he's gotta be a potent male, you know, and potent men don't say they're depressed, so I, I, I, he took his time and I took, you know, and I kept (ph)re-rewarding him. (ph)On (ph)occasion, I'd be just . . . I do a Columbo act which was - you know Columbo? - he scratched my hand and I'm like, "(ph)Well (ph)then, (ph)hope you're right about this, but is it possible? What do you think?" and he goes . . . So I don't force it, and with a woman I am less likely to do that. I'm more likely to say it sounds like you're really depressed . . . 

00:30:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:30:20
HOLLY SWEET . . . because I kinda feel like you have to be a little gentle, enter it gently, because it's so painful for a man to be depressed, cuz it really hits him really hard in terms of the male norms, and I guess that's the one thing to take away here, is that we have to pay attention to the norms that men live by and are socialized by because they're really antithetical, in large part, to talking therapy . . . 

00:30:45
RICH SIMON To therapy . . . 

00:30:45
HOLLY SWEET . . . and I'm sure other, other clinicians have said this cuz this is . . . 

00:30:45
RICH SIMON So now, so, so one of the things . . . So you're, uh . . . A big influence on the way you work is the CBT model and you're saying that that's particularly helpful and, and uh, uh, fits, matches with your work with male clients. Is, is it . . .When you're working with women, do you find that the, this, you use uh . . . Is it any different? Do you find yourself not using so much of the (crosstalk)CBT approach? 

00:31:15
HOLLY SWEET (crosstalk)No, I think it's similar, but the difference is their reactions; it takes longer with men. They're gonna be a little more resistant. They're gonna have a harder time with the relationship. They're not necessarily gonna come in . . . You know, men often kind of come and go in my practice. They're "Okay, I'm, I'm fixed," you know, and then, but they're not, and I think women are a little bit more capable of staying with it, so I do a CBT approach with women as well, but when they're emoting and having feelings and crying it feels like it's less frightening to them, so I have to be a little bit more careful. That's why the CBT . . . I do a little bit more of that and I do a lot of joking and laughing and kidding around in the office where I can cuz I feel like it makes men feel it's less like uh, baring your soul, and more like it's just a sort of psycho-ed, like a class, so (crosstalk)I, I wouldn't say I'm really different. I think that the response of the client is different . . . 

00:32:10
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah. Okay. 

00:32:10
HOLLY SWEET . . . and also, I have to, you know, sometimes I, you know, when a woman's feeling bad on the way out the door I'll kind of put my arm around her if she's a younger female client and I'm less likely to do that with a guy. I mean, maybe that's too bad, because I think I had a young male client who was just going through a lot of grief and sadness about his mother who died when he was two and he was just sitting there and, and I looked at him and I went over and gave him a hug and he said, "How'd you know I needed that?" and I said, "I just felt it." 

00:32:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:32:35
HOLLY SWEET It was like a turning point. Now, you know, if he was my age, it might be harder to do. He was a whole generation younger than me, (crosstalk)but it's kind of, you have to . . . With women, I would hesitate less. I don't tend to hug my clients but sometimes that's what's needed, but I think, again, it's a little tricky, so I feel like I have, I'm have to operate a little more carefully, a little more gently, um, let the man take the lead a little bit, um, use humor, a little more, you know, let them come and go. Sometimes "I'm fixed! I'm fine." Um, there's a great movie called Reign Over Me - R E I G H N, over me. Adam Sandler is working with Liv Tyler and he's, she has one session and he's, she has one session and he leaves and his friend says, "How'd it go?" and he said, "I'm fine. I'm all fixed", (crosstalk)in one session, you know, and then he doesn't come back the next one, then, finally, he comes back, so we need patience, because I think it's easy to get impatient and move too fast (crosstalk)or, or judge people. 

00:33:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Uh-huh, uh-huh. (crosstalk)Okay. And what about the . . . So, again, we're, we're surveying here some rough guidelines, differentials, you're all, always, there are no universals in the therapy business, but we're, we're making some broad distinctions here. So what about the, the issue of medications and the r-, and the use of medications and the different ways that men and women respond when you, when and if you do recommend medication as part of, of your (crosstalk)approach. 

00:34:00
HOLLY SWEET (crosstalk)In general, I think women have an easier time of, of thinking about medication. I, I think men are a little more reluctant because they say things like, you know, "I can do it myself; I don't need medication." I approach it like we're two scientists, and I said, "Let's just be scientific about this. Let's go and let's do an experiment", because I work at MIT part-time; I'm in Boston. It's a very academic environment. A lot of my clients are of Master's levels. I'm like, "Okay, let's be scientific. Let's run an experiment. We try medication, keep track of your mood. We'll see, after a month, what happens, and if it doesn't work, it doesn't work, but . . ." You know? And they'll say, "Well, I don't . . ." And I'll say, "So you don't really wanna take a scientific approach to this?" I kind of (crosstalk)poke at them a little bit because I think when it's, again, framed as kind of real life, like this isn't about you're morally, you know, you're weak. This is about . . .", you know, and I'll use the analogy of insulin and diabetes and antibiotics and if it is a brain dysfunction and, you know, they'll say, "Well, I . . .", you know, " . . . it'll turn me into something I'm not", and I'll say, "Well, actually, right now, your brain chemistry is probably not right and what we're doing is simply fixing what's off right now," so I, and I do psycho-ed pieces. I have them go out and read about the medications. I have them, you know . . . Occasionally, I will (ph)self-declose it, uh, disclose about, you know, my, my history with medication, but . . . And I had one client, when I did that, he refused, and I finally said, you know . . . He said, "Only crazy people take it," and I went . . . And he started to cry. He said, "Oh my God. You mean normal people take it?" and I go, "Yeah." He started next week. He changed his life, and I'm like, "Okay, that's self- disclosure." I don't normally do that but I kind of . . . Uh, I think I was (crosstalk)a little bit of cognitive, you know, like . . . You ca- . . . Uh, he was just saying something that was (ph)patently false, but, in that, I kind of was a real person to him, and I think that he could hear it. 

00:35:55
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Uh-huh, okay, all right. (crosstalk)(inaudible) Yeah. 

00:35:55
HOLLY SWEET It wasn't the, you know, detached therapist. 

00:35:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:35:55
HOLLY SWEET And that changed, it really changed his life. I'm telling you, that medication was . . . It doesn't mean he didn't need therapy but . . . So I, I take a kind of scientific approach or just reality check, right? And you know, people will say things like, "It's gonna turn you into something," you know, or "change my personality" or . . . So I, I actually believe in, in, you know, checking with your, if someone's showing symptoms of depression, a guy, check with the primary care physician, make sure it's not physical, have a consult with a psychiatrist, you know? You don't have to take medication, but at least collect the data . . . 

00:36:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:36:30
HOLLY SWEET . . . and I even say "collect the data." Data, you know? It, it, it makes it more, um, less shaming, you know, I think (crosstalk)it's more, it's just, it's just science, it's just data. It's not anything to be shamed of. 

00:36:40
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah (inaudible ) . . .Yeah. And so, and so, as someone who's worked in this area for, for uh, three, for some time, this, the medica- . . . What is, what's your experience of medication? Who, who . . . Have you formed some conclusions? As, as we know, it's a huge area of controversy in our field about the effectiveness of antidepressants and the, uh, the, the scandalous nature of some of the, the research and the way in which research is selectively published. What's your own experience and what, what seems to be effective? Who or (crosstalk)whom . . . 

00:37:15
HOLLY SWEET (crosstalk)I have to say, in my experience, when people are even moderately depressed, medication has been extremely helpful. The problem is you don't know which medication, and they all have side effects, and they range for, they're different for different people - you know this. I mean, you know, celexa pro might work great for you and it'll kill somebody . . . You know? 

00:37:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:37:35
HOLLY SWEET So I work closely with a couple of psychiatrists I trust, but I think what I explained to my clients is it won't solve your problems. It'll make it . . . The floor will be less low, you won't get as low, so you'll be, have more energy to then solve the problems, right, you know, whether it's problems in a relationship or with your dad or, you know, self-image. You're, you're . . . You know? And I'll talk about your handicap and you're, like, trying to - I don't know what - play tennis with your two feet tied together or something; you're trying to play (ph)a (ph)doll and it's not gonna work, so I think it's, in my experience, and I know there's controversy and I don't know if it's a placebo effect, and I almost don't care because it works and I think that it works in tandem with psy-, psy-, with psychotherapy, and it just . . . So . . . But if (ph)someone's (ph)that, I'm gonna be opposed to it, then I kind of go to and I use self-help books. We, we, we use a lot of the um, the work books that New Harbinger puts out, The Stress Reduction and Relaxation Workbook and, you know, there's other ways to treat depression, certainly, exercise and diet and meditation and, you know, I certainly use all those, but I, I am a big believer in medication, and I wasn't because I grew up with (ph)humanism that said, "Oh, it's just the drug companies trying to make money," and I, I don't . . . I think you, in consultation with a psychiatrist, and using it judiciously, you know, and, and then, and then having some kind of markers, like a test that you could see, or a mood log, I think it's useful. 

00:39:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:39:05
HOLLY SWEET If someone refuses to do it though, I'm not . . . What can I . . . You know? And (crosstalk)I'm not gonna say, "I can't work with you," but . . . 

00:39:10
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Sure. So, if, if . . . Looking back over, you've, you've been in the field for a while. You have a lot of experience working, uh, with, with clients and with, with uh, depressed clients. If you were to, if you were to look at your pool of depressed male clients, depressed female clients, do you have a sense that you've been more effective with one group rather than the other? Is there a big, do you feel like there's a (crosstalk)big diff- . . . Is the outcomes or, or, at the end of the process, what we define as success with one group might be, like, different than (crosstalk)suggested? 

00:39:40
HOLLY SWEET (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Well, I hate to say this, but I have been more successful with women, and I - because I'm supposedly this expert on men - I think that men are a harder population to treat, and I think the problem I see is that they bail out of therapy too soon, and I, I have a number of male clients who would get to a certain point, but they just had a hard time addressing the core issue. Some of them have come back years later and say, "Well, I'm ready for," you know, "work," but I think that our culture's made it hard for men to really take responsibility for their feelings, and then also to get the treatment that they need, whether that's medication or therapy and I think they, sometimes, leave too soon. I would guess other clinicians have had that experience. The thing that's not helpful is if you, the guy wants to leave. I don't think I could say, "No, you can't. You're not ready yet." I'd just say, "Let's talk about the progress you've made, whether you might need to come back . . .", um, you know, but I think, I think sometimes it's easier for women to, for me to see the progress, and maybe it's the progress is done in a different way. Sometimes I don't think we see the progress, that it happens outside of therapy after they've finished with us, but I don't always see . . . I've had, I've had more men leave prematurely than I have women, I think, and I wouldn't be surprised if that was true kind of across, you know, different clinicians. 

00:41:05
RICH SIMON I, I, I, I would tend to agree with you. So as we . . . We have just a few more minutes here. So as, as, to stand back from this larger picture, issue of women treating men for the purposes of this series, we, we, we, there's, there's similar issues certainly on the other side of male therapists working with women, but if, in a broad sense, if you were as uh, you were d-, desi-, if you were as a supervisor, as a mentor, what advice do you, do you have for women therapists who are feeling, for whatever reason, they're not as effective in working with their male clients as they might want to be?How does . . . How do you expand? How do you enhance your effectiveness? 

00:41:50
HOLLY SWEET I think the main way to expand it is to make sure you get, um, educated about the psychology of men. You can do that in a number of ways. There's some wonderful books out there, there are some great conferences . . . I think that, because graduate schools don't tend to teach psychology of men, it's really important that you get some training in, so there's great workshops, conferences, books . . . I think also supervision. I think everybody should be in supervision. I'm in peer supervision, uh, cuz I'm an experienced clinician, but I would not be without supervision of some kind, and I think, in that, you know, it's where you talk about your counter-transference, you talk about this stuff. I think it's important also to realize that you wanna see where your blind spots might be with men - that's your counter-transference - and also where you might need to learn some new approaches. So one of the approaches I learned a number of years ago was EMDR - eye movement desensitization reprocessing - and I said it would be interesting to learn and, you know, again, it's got that quantifiable aspect. It's got the lifebar, it's got the rating (crosstalk)scales . . . It's, it's very, kind of . . . So that seems to be helpful. Um, keep an open for the new treatments; there's a bunch of, of things coming out everyday about what may work, what doesn't. I think we need to be current with that. I think that the cognitive behavioral therapy approach is not often taught in graduate school. I think it's more of a psychodynamic piece, and I'm not sure that always . . . Uh, you know, I think you need that with something else, but I think you've gotta stay current with the tools, so I would strongly recommend that female clinicians get some kind of training, do a workshop, you know, and the other thing is just because you may not feel comfortable with men, that you don't, not doing as much as you think you can, if you're not afraid of them, if you give them hope, if you don't judge them and you have some kind of action plan and (ph)through so, you know, some kind of container or holder of hope for them, you're doing a good job. You don't have to get everything, right? 

00:43:45
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. Okay. 

00:43:45
HOLLY SWEET And I think that (ph)holding the hope is important, but you've gotta have techniques, and I think everyone, most clinicians I know, female clinicians, have had no training for psychology in men, no course or nothing. I find that appalling, because almost, most of us have had something in psychology of women, right? So that's really, I think, a deficit in our training programs, and I think, again, if there was more in our culture about men in depression and there was more training programs in our culture at large, I think more men would come into therapy and utilize it. There's still kind of a label; there's this scarlet - I don't know what - T for therapy, or C for client or something, that men wear and I think that's really - yeah - that's so unfortunate because, you know, you read about, you know, uh, Junior Seau, you know, who's played for the Patriots and killed himself. Yeah, it was probably a brain injury, but he didn't get the help he needed and he, you know, lost his life, and it's just tragic, and that's happening a lot of places and I think it's fixable. Those are fixable tragedies; they shouldn't happen, so I feel strongly that we need to educate our clinicians better since it's not a mandatory part of the training, then you have to go out and get it, so there are some great resources out there. 

00:44:55
RICH SIMON Speaking of which, so as, as we, we move towards the end of our conversation, so people who are interested in some of your resources that might be available on your website, training opportunities . . . Um, we have, and I will point this out, Holly has her new book. You can, perhaps you can tell us a little bit about Gender In The Therapy Hour as well as some of these (crosstalk)other training resources that (ph)other (ph)people (crosstalk)(ph)might (ph)need. 

00:45:20
HOLLY SWEET (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)So this book came out of my connection with the American Psychological Association. Um, I would urge you all, whether you're social workers, mental health workers, to get involved in your own professional organization, and then there probably is a subset of psychology of men. Go find out about it. There's a great group in it that, in APA, a division of study of men and masculinity, and I got involved with them 20 years ago and, through the connection, I've learned a lot about it. I was asked to edit the book by one of the leaders in the division and I found 12 women who were in that division who were experts in working with men, including a few who weren't (ph)who (ph)had (ph)new (ph)clinicians cuz I think it's important for the new clinicians to have a voice, in a (crosstalk)book like this, and so I got them together and we went on a couple of retreats together and talked about how to write the book and everybody wrote a chapter and uh . . . 

00:46:10
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay. (inaudible ) 

00:46:13
HOLLY SWEET . . . it came out and it's very personal, so I figured it was the kind of book I'd like to read - I might as well edit a book I'd like to read - so . . . And everyone talks about some mistakes they've made, talked about things they've learned, they talked about case studies . . . Um, there's also conference coming up, uh, June 9th in Fordham University about, uh, working with men. I think it's really interesting. It's an exciting field because there's not that many, uh, clinicians working in the psychology of men, but especially female clinicians who are experts in this field, so there's, there's room for a lot more of us in this field. I think it's really important, so that's uh . . . You know, I think . . . And the other thing is just, you know, go on the internet and, you know . . . I, I couldn't find much, but I would suggest joining your professional association and then seeing what's within that. 

00:47:00
RICH SIMON Okay. Now, is there, is . . . If, if, if . . . Is there one-stop shopping? Can people go to your website? Do you have a website that they can . . . 

00:47:05
HOLLY SWEET I don't have a website, um, but (crosstalk)they can e-mail me. I don't have the website yet. I'm (crosstalk)building it. I know. Here I am at MIT with no website. 

00:47:10
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Are you . . . (crosstalk)(ph)Oh (ph)my! Okay. 

00:47:15
HOLLY SWEET I'm a technophobe, what can I say? 

00:47:15
RICH SIMON All right, but we'll have the contact information through the course, so we, we, (crosstalk)people . . . 

00:47:20
HOLLY SWEET (crosstalk)Yeah, that's . . . And they're welcome to e-mail me, and I'm building a website this summer, so I'll have one by the end of this summer . . . 

00:47:25
RICH SIMON Good for you, okay. 

00:47:25
HOLLY SWEET . . . but um, yeah, I'd be happy . . . I also have a um, (ph)list (ph)serve that people can join. These are . . . This is a list for women who are interested in men's issues. 

00:47:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:47:35
HOLLY SWEET So if they e-mail me then I'll put them on the list (ph)service about 50 people in it, on it who are women and we can talk about issues and it's very interesting (crosstalk)cuz it's like a (ph)collegial group, so any woman listening to this that wants to get involved in this group . . . We talk about the, the trainings, we talk about issues and I think it's really be great to have more numbers. 

00:47:55
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Great. Okay, so . . . 

00:47:55
HOLLY SWEET So . . .

RICH SIMON Which leads us into the, to our, the next, uh, order of, of business with, with uh, our conversations: they always end with an invitation to continue the conversation through our comment board, so if, if, if uh, for whatever reason, you have some, whatever uh, you care to share about what stood out for you about the conversation . . . I mean, one of the things that's really strike whenever I talk to you Holly is how forthcoming you are and how you really name issues that, often, have not been named, at least when I've been around, about these, the, these kind of subterranean dynamics of men and women in the consulting room, so, in any case, um, we really invite you to, to, if you have questions, if you have comments, if Holly has helped you connect the dots, if you're looking to get more information, just go up, uh, and, and take a moment now, respond on the comment board, um, but for the moment, our conversation is uh, has come to a conclusion. Thank you so much Holly. This . . . It's, it's uh, is, really is eye-opening to talk to you and you're really doing important work and I very much appreciate your being a part of this series.
