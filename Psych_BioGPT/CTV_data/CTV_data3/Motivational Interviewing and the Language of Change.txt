Motivational Interviewing and the Language of Change William R. Miller, Ph.D. The University of New Mexico Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference 2013 

00:00:00
MICHAEL MUNION Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Please find your seats. We're gonna begin here just momentarily. My name is, ah, Michael Munion. This 8 a.m. on Sunday morning on the last day of the Evolution Conference. You know where you are. Nobody is here by accident. We're all here to hear about Motivational Interviewing and the Language of Change, ah, with Dr. Bill Miller, so please join me in welcoming probably one of the only guys that will get you out of bed here on, on Sunday morning, Dr. Bill Miller.

DR. WILLIAM MILLER Good morning. I always enjoyed teaching at night at the University of New Mexico because the people who came had been working all day, they had to get child care, and they, they come they say, "You better teach me something because I, I work hard to get here." I appreciate your coming out so early on the last day of the, of the meeting. Well, I wanna tell you a story. I wanna, I wanna tell you the story of motivational interviewing and little bit about where it came from and what's happening because it's a very organic phenomenon. It's, it's evolving quite a lot over the 30 years or so of it-- ah, it's been around. 

00:01:15
Why don't people change? 

00:01:15
DR. WILLIAM MILLER And in a way, the puzzle, it, it begins with this, "Why don't people change?" Ah, I mean, I, I was trained to help people who want to change and then I quickly discovered the problem with that, that at least in the addiction field, very often, ah, people who even come for treatment aren't quite sure they wanna do this yet, you know. 

00:01:35
What's the Problem? The Problem They don't know They don't sere They're not being rational They don't care What they need Knowledge Insight Rationality Fear 

00:01:35
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Now, there are some ideas around about why people don't change or common sentimental models about it. One is they don't know and so what they need is knowledge. We need to educate them. Another is they don't see and so, we, we need to give them insight into what's going on. Or they're not being rational. They need, they need a, a reason that's true. They need rationality from us. Or they don't care and we, we need to just care of basically. It's just a medical model, ah, approach. They're all, they're all deficit models, ah, that the clients' missing something and we need to provide it to them. All right? 

00:02:15
The righting reflex I tell them, and I tell them, and I tell them and they still don't change! 

00:02:15
DR. WILLIAM MILLER And helpers like to do that. I mean, I don't know why you wanna do a helping profession, but most people go into a health profession because they wanna help. They want to, ah, set things right. If people are going down the wrong road, they wanna take them off for that road and put them on to a different road. You wanna fix things. You, you, you wanna do help people get straight into their lives. And so, we hear this frustration, ah, not just from psychotherapists but from primary care doctors and dental technicians and all kinds of people. I tell them, and I tell them, and I tell them and they still don't change. And maybe the problem is that we tell them, you know? 

00:02:55
A BETTER QUESTION: WHY DO PEOPLE CHANGE? Stages of Change Prochaska & DiClemente Maintenance Precontemplation Contemplation Preparation Action Motivational Interviewing was originally designed for working with people who are less ready to change... 

00:02:55
DR. WILLIAM MILLER I think a better question is, why do people change? And my friends, Jim Prochaska and Carlo DiClemente had made a really big contribution to this that you're probably quite familiar with, The Stages of Change Model that people are simply at different levels of readiness. Some people don't see any reasons for change really and you might call them, ah, ah, being precontemplation. Some people are, are ambivalent. They kind of want to change and they also don't want to change at the same time, the stage that they call them ambivalent or contemplation. Then, the scales start to tip and you began thinking, "What could I do?" and that's what they called preparation. Ah, the action stage is taking some kind of step to actually make a change. And then, the maintenance stage is, is rotating the change that you have. And the radical, very useful idea here is that people need different things from us depending where they are in their stages of change. Well, there wasn't really much around in the early 1980s to help people who weren't yet ready for change. In the addiction field, we've just said, "Go away and come back when you're motivated," you know, well that's, that's not good enough. We don't say that to cancer patients. You know, it's a-- and, and, ah, we now know that there's a lot that you can do with the help of people move from precontemplation and contemplation around to getting ready for change and actually doing it. 

00:04:20
which could b the most of those you see Precontemplation Contemplation 80% Preparation Action 20% 

00:04:20
DR. WILLIAM MILLER And in fact, at least in the addiction field, about 80% of people who walked through the door or somewhere back in precontemplation or contemplation. And yet, my training as a cognitive behavior therapist was to help people in the action stage, so I was well-prepared to help 20% of my clients, ah, and I'd been trying to work on the deficit ever since here. 

00:04:45
A Radical Idea Clients are whole and complete people, already possessing everything needed to move ahead. 

00:04:45
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Now, here's a radical idea. Clients are whole and complete people, already possessing everything needed to move forward. They already have what they need and your job was to call it forth. Now, that could be a quote from Carl Rogers with very much-- ah, like the heart of Carl Rogers work. But actually, it's a quote from Steve Hayes who is also speaking at this meeting. And this, this idea that people are whole-- and already have what they need and ne-- need your help in finding it. Ah, it is something that is evolving very much even in fields as staunchly and autocratic as behavior therapy once was, you know, so yeah. 

00:05:25
AMBIVALENCE I want it and I don't want it 

00:05:30
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Central idea in motivational interviewing is people can get stuck in ambivalence and, and that is the characteristic phenomenon of the con-- of the contemplation stage. I want it and I don't want it. I wanna be in this relationship and I don't wanna be in this relationship. I wanna lose weight and I really like eating, you know. Ah, I wanna quit smoking and, and boy, and that's the only way I know how to relax. And both things simultaneously. There's nothing pathological about that. That, that just human nature that simultaneously, we want something we don't want it. Ah, and it's a place you can get lock up and, and stuck for quite a while. 

00:06:10
What happens when... The Righting Reflex Ambivalence The Power of Self-Talk You do not what you yourself think until you put it into words. -Garrison Keiller People are generally better persuaded by the reasons which they have themselves discovered than by those which have come into the mind of others. -Blaise Pascal 

00:06:10
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Now, what happens when someone who's ambivalent meets a helper with the righting reflex? Yeah. Well, what happens is the helper takes all the good lines. The helper says, "Well, look. This is a serious problem and you need to do something about it. And here's what you can do." And, and you know the answer to that. You know the client's natural responses. Yes, but, no. And that's not denial, that's not pathology, that's just ambivalence. That if you take one side of an ambivalent person's conflict, they will voice the other side and you kind of act out the conflict which is sort of cool. You know, it's like this is a kind of psychodrama except for a problem that we tend to believe what we say more than what other people say. Garrison Keiller says, "You do not what you yourself think until you put it into words." As you hear yourself talk, you learn what you think. It goes back to, ah, self-perception theory by Daryl Bem decades ago, or even quote from Pascal. "People are generally better persuaded by the reasons which they have themselves discovered than by those which have come into the mind of others." You know, so the important lesson for psychotherapists here that in a way what we need to do if we're a client or a human being is persuade ourselves to change. Not have somebody else do it. And, in general, human beings I find all over the planet, don't respond well on somebody telling them what's wrong with them and what they should do. You just, you just don't respond in a friendly way to that. I'm reminding you this, every time I come to the Albuquerque Airport, because we come through an automatic door, and if you try to push the door to go faster, it locks up. Well, clients are like that, too, you know. You try to push and they lock up, you know. 

00:08:05
"Resistance" predicts lack of change, and counselor style drives resistance 

00:08:05
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Resistance which is the term I'm actually trying to recover from at this point cuz it-- it's a very therapist century term, you know, clients don't see it that way but we see it that way. But at, at least, the behavior they get labeled as resistance is a good predictor of not changing. And we also know from good behavioral researches, that resistance is very much under the control of the, of the therapist. It's very much a, a response to what counselors are doing because resistance only occurs in a relationship. It's an interpersonal phenomenon, so there are two people involved in it. 

00:08:40
Therapist Style and Client Resistance Patterson and Forgatch (1985) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology 1985 53 346-851 Imagine this: Counselors were trained to switch their counseling style every 12 minutes within sessions, between E. an empathic/listening style and D. a directive/teaching style E - D - E - D 

00:08:40
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Here's an example from Jerry Patterson back in the '80s, ah, family-- ah, behavioral family therapist at the University of Oregon. If you can imagine this. Change you counseling style every 12 minutes. All right? There's little light on the wall behind the client and, ah, and when it's-- one caller then you, ah, are doing your best to be Carl Rogers. You listen emphatically, respectfully, kinda follow the person, ah, and, and empathizing and reflecting what they say. And then when the light change it's color then you switch over to being a teacher and directive and giving people information and, and, ah, advice about what to do. And Jerry's question was, what happens to resistance during those episodes? 

00:09:25
Client resistance responses per minute of counseling 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 F1 D1 F2 D2 Bottom Line: When you tell clients what to do, they tend to get defensive 

00:09:30
DR. WILLIAM MILLER And there's the answer. Ah, the, the peaks are during the directive teaching episodes. When you're, when you're being a teacher and trying to convey things to people, you see resistance go up just exactly as I said. Ah, the people respond with the other side of their ambivalence. When you're listening, resistance go down. And we found that consistently over decades that, that if you behave in the kind of way that Carl Rogers taught us to, you just don't get a whole lot of resistance. Ah, it-- it's kinda melts away. 

00:10:00
Predicting 12-month drinking from in-session responses Correlation Coefficient 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 Confront 0.59 Argue 0.62 Interrupt 0.68 Negative 0.58 Off Task 0.44 Therapist Behavior Client Behavior Miller, W. R., Benefield, R.G. & Tonigan, J.S. (1993) Enhancing motivation for change in problem drinking. A controlled comparison of two therapist styles. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 61, 455-461 

00:10:00
DR. WILLIAM MILLER We found the same thing in the 1993 study. This was with, with drinkers being treated with alcohol problems and we found we could predict 12-month drinking their behavioral measure. How many drinks per week is the person having from a single therapist behavior? The more the therapist confronted, the more the client drink. All right. We could also predict from client's resistance how much they're gonna be drinking. So, the more they were arguing, interrupting, saying that they didn't have a problem and changing the subject also, the le-- the, the more they were gonna be drinking a year later. But in this very study, we found that those behaviors under the experimental control of the therapist. So, if you counsel in a way that evokes resistance, you're gonna have clients who don't change. 

00:10:50
1978 Miller, Taylor & West, 1980 Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology 48, 590–601 ◘ Problem drinkers were randomly assigned to bibliotherapy or to one of nine outpatient counselors, all delivering the same treatment: behavioral self-control training ◘ 3 supervisors rated counselor's levels of accurate empathy (Truax & Carkhuff scale) with high inter-rater reliability What is Accurate Empathy? ◘ Empathy is not: • Having had the same experience or problem • Identifying with your client • "Let me tell you my story" ◘ Empathy is: • The ability to accurately understand you client's meaning • And to reflect that accurate understanding back to your client • As described and studied by Carl Rogers and his students in client-centered counseling 

00:10:50
DR. WILLIAM MILLER This is an even older study as you can see. We have nine therapists and three supervisors in-- including myself in this study. And we randomly assigned problem drinkers to therapists. There were nine different therapists. So, the clients you got were not-- which ones I think you'll do the best with. But just look at the drawing. You, you get whatever clients you get, all delivering the same manual-guided behavioral treatment self-controlled treatment. All right? And we have three supervisors sitting behind one-way mirror. It's that so long ago this was looking through one-way mirrors and, ah, tracking what the therapist is doing including we have in our lapse a scale from Truax and Carkhuff, two students of Carl Rogers, ah, for rating accurate empathy. How well is this person listening to the client understanding what the, the client is saying and reflecting it back. And we line up our therapists according from two rank order from the, from the most empathic to the least empathic. And then, we got our outcome data and, and, and we took a look at it. But let me say what, what empathy is before we move on. It's not having had the same experience. It's not that happened to me, too. Let me tell you my story, you know. It's not identifying with your client. That actually gets in the way of doing good therapy. It is the ability to accurately understand what your client is saying and reflect that back to them. And, and Rogers and his students described it very well in client-centered counseling. 

00:12:30
Therapist Empathy Percent Positive Outcomes 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 100 75 100 75 33 75 60 40 25 60 Miller, Taylor & West (1980) JCCP 48: 590-601 

00:12:30
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Well, here is what we've found. On the left, we have the number one most empathic therapist. All of us rated this therapist the first out of nine and 100% of her clients had a good outcome. And the same as true as number three. And, and two and four weren't doing badly either. Ah, the number nine therapist, two of us rated that person as nine and the other rated it, that person as eight out of nine, so the, the least emphatic. That person went to a medical school by the way. E-- and you can see that there-- there's a pretty good correlation between how well the therapist was listening and, and how much the clients change their drinking. And over there on the right, you see a little bar that says 60%. That was the success rate of bibliotherapy of clients being given a self-help book with the same methods in it and going home and working on their own. Now, if you average all the therapist together, you come to the conclusion that therapists are no different from self-help manuals. And you would be wrong. Because look at the data. We've got, we've got five out of nine therapists where clients actually have a better chance working without therapist than working on their own. And we have three therapists where the client would have been better off going home with a good book. And you average all the therapists together and it just kinda looks about mediocre same as, as, ah, working on their own. And anytime you look at therapist effects in, in clinical outcome for us, you, you find this. You, you find substantial differences among therapist no matter how manual-guided, closely supervised, everything tape- recorded, no matter help-controlled it is, one of the biggest determinants of what you're gonna get better is the therapist to whom you're assigned. And what we found is that one of the most important, ah, pieces of that is empathy. 

00:14:25
A BARBERSHOP IN NORWAY 1982 

00:14:30
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Well, on my first sabbatical, I went off to Norway with those data, you know, as trained as a behavior therapist, you know. But I have this, this finding that empathy was accounting for two-thirds of the variants in client outcomes during behavior therapy. So, I was kind of puzzling over that. And, and they gave me a lovely office on the corner. It had been a barbershop of the hospital and they ran the barber out to make room for a visiting professor. And, and I was lecturing on behavioral treatment of alcoholism but the director of the clinic say, "Would you also meet with our psychologists? Most of them were pretty grin or just out of school and just, you know, just a conversation every couple of weeks." I said, "Sure. I can do that." So we did it. And what they wanted to do was to role-play the most difficult clients that they were seeing and essentially, they didn't say this but essentially say, "Okay, smart guy, what would you do with this?" you know, ah, and so we did that. We were having fun with it. And, ah, I-- particularly, we're using a lot of Rogers' act to impart. Because the first time I ever worked on addiction unit, I knew absolutely nothing. Ah, and so, I learned from the patients. I just put on my Rogers' hat and did my best listening and learned from them. How did you get here? And what's your life like? And where do you, where do you hope you're going with? And I, I learned a lot and the clients seemed to like it. So, I, I found this kind of Rogerian approach was pretty good with people with alcohol problems. And then, by the way, then I started reading the literature and it said alcoholics are pathological ni-- deniers and liars and you can't really to them and they're impossible people. And I said to them, "They must be different in Milwaukee because I, I"-- those are the people I'm experiencing. Well, I, I came with that good experience with clients in therapy. And so, I say with role-playing, European psychologists are trained to be very reflective, eh, and very kind of philosophical and analytical in what they're doing. And they would interrupt me and say, "What are you thinking?" My own students never interrupted me, you know, but, but these people would. They say, "No, stop it. What's going on your head at this moment?" Are you-- now you ask the client a question there. Why did you ask that question? Could you, could you have asked lots of things? Are you-- you reflected what the client said. Now, the client had said lots of things. Of all the things you could have reflected, what did you reflect then? And, and in my Rogerian training I'd never been told which things to reflect. I'm just kind of tell the person, you know, so that-- and they caused me to verbalize some decision roles I was using that I was not aware of, that were embarrassingly different from my lectures on behavioral treatment of, of alcohol problems which I was giving in the next room, you know. 

00:17:20
Basic Concepts (Miller, 1983) ◘ The person, rather than the clinician, should be voicing the arguments for change ◘ Evoke the person's own concerns and motivations ◘ Listen with empathy ◘ Minimize resistance ◘ Nurture hope and optimism Carl Rogers 

00:17:25
DR. WILLIAM MILLER And the basic concepts were these, that it really should be the client who's making the arguments for change and not me, all right, hat, that my job is to evoke the person's own concerns and their own motivations for change and then to listen with empathy just exactly as Rogers did, ah, to minimize resistance to no-- not respond to our resistance in the way that causes it to go up. Best way to increase resistance is to push against it. Okay, so don't do that. And nurture hope and optimism. So very much Rogers but we're, we're adding two at this particular intentional somewhat directional idea of listening for and intentionally evoking the person's own arguments for change, uhm, and, ah, and listening particularly to those and summarizing those. And then I wrote it down-- wrote down these decision roles that we were developing together. And I gave it the motivation interviewing cuz it's about motivation, and I like to interviewing because in English at least, not in other languages but in English, the power relationship is neutral. It's not clear who's the more powerful person in an interview. Maybe your-- the boss interviewing people for a job, you know, or maybe your student interviewing a family psychotherapist at this conference, you know. I mean, i-- so, interviewing is kind of a neutral term. So, if I call at anything else, it would have been motivational conversation I think because that's kind of what it's like. 

00:18:50
Basic Concepts (Miller, 1983) ◘ The person, rather than the clinician, should be voicing the arguments for change ◘ Evoke the person's own concerns and motivations ◘ Listen with empathy ◘ Minimize resistance ◘ Nurture hope and optimism Carl Rogers 

00:18:50
DR. WILLIAM MILLER And I send it to a few colleagues as Rogers used to do as a discussion paper saying, "Tell me what you think." And one of my colleagues said, "I wanna publish it." I said, "I just made it, I just made it out." The, the only numbers are pages numbers for goodness sake." I mean, I-- he said, "It o-- it's okay. It's all right. I think it's, I think it's an interesting paper. Let me publish it and cut it in half which the others do," he always say. So, so I did and he published it. And I thought that was the last I would hear of it. But the thing took off like a rocket, you know. 

00:19:25
Active "Ingredients" of MI ◘ Relational: An empathic client-centered style and absence of authoritarian "expert" role ◘ Technical: Evoking clients' own "change talk" (originally called "self-motivational statements") Miller, W.R. & Rose, G.S. (2009): Toward a theory of motivational interviewing. American Psychologist, 64, 527-537. 

00:19:25
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Well, we've been studying this now for 30 years. And there seem to be two-- at least two, and I'm sure there are more that we don't know about yet active ingredients or components, ah, that, that influence the efficacy of motivational interviewing. One of them is definite relational. And you saw it with the-- with our empathy study that, that when you're more empathic, when you're listening, when you're very client-centered, communicate, respect, and love for the person you're, you're talking to, they're more likely to change. Ah, and it's also the absence of authoritarian "I know best", "I will tell you what to do," "I'm in charge here" kind of stuff, you know. Sometimes I think training in motivational interviewing just helps people stop doing the counter-therapeutic things and that, that is the main benefit. One, one pundit said that maybe the active ingredient in brief intervention is gravity of exposure to with therapists. Okay. But, but the other component is this technical one of, of arranging the conversation in a way so that you hear what we call change talk, ah, that the client is making the arguments for change. And you can do that. You, you can arrange your sessions in a way that it's actually the client who, who evokes those or who emits those kinds of statements that we originally called self-motivational statements in the first edition of our book. And, and the more client does that, the, the more you would expect change. They're literally talking themselves into change. 

00:21:00
A serious embarrassment Change talk was not predicting change OOPS! "Change Talk" Psycholinguistics Change Paul Amrhein, PhD Preparatory change talk: Desire (want, wish, like) Ability (can, could, able) Reason (if...then) Need (must, have to, need to) DARN 

00:21:00
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Well, then we run on to a serious embarrassment for this idea that change talk has to be recorded. It was not predicting change. That's, that's a kind of a serious flaw in the, in the way we were thinking about motivational interviewing. Ah, it is like "umf", yeah. But I had the good fortune to meeting a psycholinguists that we hired on the faculty named Paul Amrhein, ah, now back in New Jersey. And Paul came talking about the ways in which we make agreements with each other and the language that we use to ask for things and to agree to doing things. And he said, "You-- change talk is way too messy when you're combining too many things." So you-- let me help you break it down into components. One of which is desire. So, when client say, "I, I want to lose weight," you know, "I, I wish I could stop smoking," you know, "I'd, I'd like to have more friends." And whether you're using desire language. And that's one kind of transaction that happens in speech. Quite different from it, ability language. Ability language is "I'm able to," "I could," "I can". So, if I have plenty of plans, I say, "Well, I could stop drinking but why would I wanna do that?" you know. So, that slow desire high ability. You can have it the other way around, you know. "I really wanna stop smoking but I don't think I can." you know, so you get all kinds of combinations of these things. Reasons. In western cultures, in particular, we give this "if", "then" statements. "Well, if, if quit smoking, I, I think I'd have a lot more money to spend because I'm spending a lot on tobacco." "If I quit drinking, my wife would be happy." "Hmm, you know, if, if then I''ll not probably feel better in the morning." And need statements. You hear this too in your own work. "Something has to change. I can't go on the way I have. I have to lose weight. I, I need to quit smoking." you know, but none of those say, "I will." 

00:23:00
Mobilizing Change Talk reflect resolution of ambivalence Commitment (intention, decision, promise) Activation (willing, ready, preparing) Taking steps CATs 

00:23:00
DR. WILLIAM MILLER On the other side of the hill, we have what we called mobilizing change talk. It's kinda getting, kinda getting rolling. The most obvious of which is commitment language. "I will. I'm going to. I promise." It's a language I like to hear from clients. "Yeah, yes." Commitment language. It's also the language you like to hear with the altar when you're going to get married, not, "Not I want to," you know, or "I could marry you." But there are other kinds of speech. They are getting close to commitment. They're still on the down hillside. "Well, I'm willing to do that, you know, I'm prepared to do that. I'm ready to do this. If you'll ask me to do something for you and I say, "I'm willing to do that." I haven't quite said I will, but it's you know, pretty good. I mean, that's getting here. Ah, and then taking steps is, is doing thing as usually in between sessions that move you closer to the behavior. So for-- if I'm talking to a client about exercising more, that's what they wanna do. And they get back and they say, "You know I brought a pair of good running shoes this week." Well, okay, that's stepping in the right direction, you know. Or, "I, I, I went two days this week without drinking." "Well, all right. Good. How did you do that? Well, it's fantastic. What a change? Tell me about what you did and how that work for you." you know, so it's, it's reinforcing any step in the right direction. 

00:24:30
Mobilizing Change Talk reflect resolution of ambivalence ◘ Commitment (intention, decision, promise) ◘ Activation (willing, ready, preparing) ◘ Taking steps CATs 

00:24:30
DR. WILLIAM MILLER So, a lot of motivation interviewing is first tuning your ear to hear these things that client say and to know that those are really important, that those are meaningful client statements, ah, that you need to not miss. And when I'm listening to trainees learning motivational interviewing, all of these little gold nuggets just go by and it's like they don't hear them. So, hearing them is a-- is an important piece of it. 

00:24:50
Talking Oneself into Change Desire Ability Reasons Need Commitment Change 

00:24:55
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Now, what Paul Amrhein model was that it-- he found desirability, reasons and need actually predicted commitment language. So, if you say, "I want to, I could, I need to, I have good reasons to," you're more likely then to say I will. And, and in his research, "I will" is a thing that predicted actually doing it. It's, ah, consisting with the implementation intention research and cognitive science these days that if you express to another person your intention to do some things specifically, you're much more likely to do it. But other people, quite a few have found that desirability reasons and then you also directly predict change without going through commitment as mediator. So, change talk now better defined-- more carefully defined is, is predicting outcomes much better. 

00:25:45
CHANGE TALK AND SUSTAIN TALK Opposite Sides of a Coin Sustain Talk (Smoking) The other side of ambivalence ◘ I really like smoking (Desire) ◘I don't see how I could quit (Ability) ◘ Smoking is the only way I can relax (Reason) ◘ I don't need to quit; I need to smoke (Need) ◘ I intend to keep smoking and nobody can stop me (Commitment) ◘ I'm not ready to quit (Activation) ◘ I bought four cartons today (Taking Steps) 

00:25:45
DR. WILLIAM MILLER But an important piece is the other side of the coin because all the same speech acts you will also hear on behalf of a status quo which we call "sustain talk" that's talk in favor of carrying on the way I have been. For example about smoking. "I really like smoking." That's desire talk. "I don't see how I could quit." That's ability talk. "Smoking is the only way I can relax." Reason talk. "I don't need to quit, I need to smoke." Yeah. New language, right? "I intend to keep on smoking and nobody can stop me." That is commitment. Yeah. "I'm not ready to quit." That's activation language. "I bought four cartons today. That's taking steps. All right. Yeah. Yeah. So, if you're working with ambivalent people, you will hear both things in the same sentence, in the same paragraph. And that's not crazy, it's human nature. You know, we're just like that, that we want and don't want things simultaneously and we get locked up there. And motivational interviewing is helping people get out of that forest, get away from what is the natural inclination which just think of a reason to change, think of a reason not change, and stop thinking about it because it's unpleasant, you know. and instead stay with the reasons for change and strengthen those, ah, and, and not strengthen sustain talk. 

00:27:15
The balance of pros to cons predicts change As the balance tips, we move from precontemplation and contemplation to preparation and action Maintenance Precontemplation Contemplation Preparation Action 

00:27:15
DR. WILLIAM MILLER And it's-- it actually as the balance of pros and cons that predicts change. And Jim Prochaska has found this that one marker of movement around the stages of change is that the balance between pros and cons begin to shift. And you see more of the pros of change over time. Well, can you make that happen therapeutically? Yes, you can. 

00:27:35
Change Talk Matters ◘ Change talk can be reliably coded ◘ In-session client speech predicts behavioral outcome at follow-up ◘ Especially the ratio of change talk to sustain talk ◘ Particularly later in the session ◘Not only in motivational interviewing sessions • Also cognitive-behavior therapy • And 12-step facilitation therapy ◘ In other words, we normally talk ourselves into (or out of) change by the balance of pros and cons that we consider ◘ Voicing one's motivations for change aloud to another person can be particularly powerful and it matters what the listener does 

00:27:40
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Change talk matters. It can be reliably measure so we have very good ways to listening to sessions and, and with inter-rater reliability, co-change talk now. What the client says doing the session when you listen to sustain talk and change talk predicts whether changes actually gonna happen. So, you, got-- one important thing that means is you're getting immediate feedback during your session on whether you're doing it right or now. Cuz when the client gives you change talk, that's your client saying, "Well done. You're moving on the right direction." And when your client begins to argue and back away and back paddle and say, "I'm not sure I wanna do this," that's your client saying, "Why didn't you not do more of what you were just doing," you know, "and try something different? Try a different avenue and try a different path." Now, with immediate feedback, you can learn. You can get better at this which is what psychotherapists generally don't do over the course of their career. One of the best replicated findings is after 30 years of practice, you have the same outcome as you did after six months of practice. You know, that's not true of surgeons. You know, surgeons get feedback. We, often, are behind closed doors in a, in a situation that prevents us from learning. But once you learn to hear change talk, you're now getting immediate constant feedback during the session about how to do it better. So, to put in kind of everyday language, we normally talk ourselves into or out of change with this the balance of pros and cons. And the more I voi-- voice my own pro-change arguments, the more I'm moving in that direction becoming commitment to it. And there's something about saying it aloud in the presence of another human being that is particularly powerful. A man standing client's home to write down 100 times, "I will not smoke. I will not smoke. I will not smoke." It doesn't seem to have the power that a client simultaneously saying in your presence. I'm going to stop smoking. It has. Hmm. there's something about voice motivation-- the presence of another person that matters. And it matters what you do. It matters a great deal what the listener does.

The Underlying Spirit of MI Partnership Acceptance Compassion Evocation 

00:30:05
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Now, we were teaching techniques at the beginning of motivational interviewing and then we watched people practicing what we taught them. And they were doing what we taught them and we were horrified. Sometimes when clients do or when, when therapists do exactly what we tell them is not such a good thing. I, I used to-- I taught the first semester course, ah, for, for clinical psychology students and I always say, "Now, if your client looks depressed, ask about suicidal risk. Ask-- find out whether they're considering suicide because you need to know that and they may not tell you." Then I was watching one of my first year students interview a client was just depressed, down and-- "My, my life is worthless. I'm a lousy father. I'm a failure at work. I'm probably gonna get fired at work and then-- and I'm chained in the office like is worth it." And I'm sitting here and thinking, "Come on. Come on." you know, and then finally I saw the light go on his eyes and he lean forward and said, "Well, had you considered suicide?" 

00:31:05
[sil.] 

00:31:15
DR. WILLIAM MILLER It was-- he, he, he, he did what I said, you know, but it's, it's not what I had in mind. And we discovered people who are trying to use motivational interviewing like a trick to get people to do what you want to do. Ah, and it's not that. And so, Steve Rollnick and I say, you know, we're obviously, we're leaving something important to out. And what is it? It's the spirit behind it. It's, it's the mindset and the heart set with what you come into this kind of-- this conversation with people. 

00:31:45
MI Spirit Partnership Compassion Acceptance Evocation 

00:31:45
DR. WILLIAM MILLER And we talked about at it now as having four components. A, a partnership components. So, this is two equal human beings talking to each other, not an expert trying to fix somebody, not a teacher talking to a passive student, not a mechanic working on an automobile, you know, but, but two human beings having a conversation. Profound acceptance of the other person as they are. Isn't it, isn't it strange that when you feel unacceptable, it's very hard to change? And then when you experience acceptance from another human being or from God or from whatever that suddenly it becomes possible to change, you know. And conveying that acceptance of the person, not judgment, not disapproval, not punishment. It's not-- if you can make feel people bad enough then they'll change, quite the opposite, you know? When you can help people to feel to accept their current situation and themselves, it becomes freeing as possible to change. Evocation to call forth from the person that which is already there. So, we don't say, "I have what you need and I'm gonna install it into you." We say, "You have what you need and together we're gonna find it." Uh-hmm, and compassion. The reason we're doing this is the other person's welfare. We mean of the same thing the Dalai Lama means. It is to act in love on behalf of the other person's wel-- welfare and growth. And that's the reason we're having this conversation. And we added that because the other three things you can use in sales-- I mean, you, you go to a car lot, that person's gonna be very companionable and be interested in what you want and very accepting of your interests and so forth, but the motivation there is to make a sale. In psychotherapy, the motivation is the other person's growth and welfare, not mine. We're not here about me. 

00:33:35
Can counselors really influence the balance of client's change and sustain talk? Therapist Behavior and Client Change Talk ◘ Correlational Research: MI-consistent therapist responses are associated with higher levels of client change talk ◘ Sequential Research: In lag-1 conditional probabilities, therapist MI-consistent responses are followed by client change talk ◘ Experimental Research: 

00:33:40
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Now, a critical thing is, can you really influence the balance of change talk and sustain talk? Is that, is that even possible to do? Well, in correlation on research it is, so we find that, that then amount of MI-consistent speech that the therapist offers is very related to the amount of change talk that you hear. We've done sequential researches just like Jerry Patterson did. And when the therapist emits an MI-consistent response, what's the probability the next thing will be changed talk? It goes up substantially. We've also learned when a client gives you change talk, what is the next thing you should do so that the next thing the client says is also change talk? So, we've used that kind of within the subject design and then also experimental research. 

00:34:20
Client responses with random assignment to counselor styles Client Behavior Counts 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 Change Talk 21.3 43.6 Resistance 21.6 12.7 Directive Empathic Miller, W.R., Benefield, R.G., & Tonigan, J.S. (1993). Enhancing motivation for change in problem drinking: A controlled comparison of two therapist styles. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 61, 455-461. 

00:34:25
DR. WILLIAM MILLER We randomly assigned counselors to do motivational interviewing or a, a more didactic kind of approach and we found the same thing Patterson did. We got twice as much change talk and half as much resistance when we listen to our clients instead of telling them what to do. So, the balance of change talk and sustain talk is very related to the way you're talking to people. If you think-- if, if all of your clients seemed to be in denial, it's not because they walk through the door that way. All right? 

00:34:55
Evoking Change Talk Glynn & Moyers (2010), Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 39: 65-70 ◘ 9 counselors alternated (in 12-minute segments) between ■ MI: MI to evoke change talk and ■ FA: Functional analysis of drinking ◘ with counterbalanced order ◘ in 47 conversations about drinking concerns ◘ Coded change talk (CT) and sustain talk (ST) ◘ Dependent measure: % CT vs. ST ◘ Roughly 2:1 ratio of CT:ST predicts change % 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1.63 MI1 0.85 FA1 2.00 MI2 1.17 FA2 Glynn & Moyers (2010), Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 39:65-70 

00:34:55
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Terri Moyers repeated that Patterson study with nine counselors talking to people about their drinking, coding change talk and sustain talk and had the counselors switch back in 12-minute intervals between motivational interviewing and functional analysis of, of very useful behavior therapy technique. And what she found was the balance of change talk to sustain talk shifted was much higher and motivational interviewing in the first segment of that are 1.6 ratio, then you start doing functional analysis and the direction reverses. You're getting more sustain talk than change talk. Then you switch back to motivational interviewing and, boom, it goes to 2:1 which is about the threshold for predicting change. Then, you go back to functional analysis and the difference just about to disappears again. So, the balance between pros and cons is very much under your experimental control. It's very much a function of what you're doing.

Comparing MI with Non-directive Listening ◘ Patients with mild/moderate alcohol dependence ◘ Randomly assigned to: ■ Non-directive reflective listening (4 sessions) ■ Motivational enhancement ■ No further counseling ◘ Same therapists delivered both treatments ◘ 6-month follow-up (N = 122) Sellman J.D., Sullivan, P.F., Dore, G.M., Adamson, S. J. & MacEwan, I. (2001). A randomized controlled trial of motivational enhancement therapy (MET) for mild to moderate alcohol dependence. Journal of Studies on Alcohol, 62(3),389-396 

00:35:50
DR. WILLIAM MILLER There's also a randomized trials comparing motivational interviewing with non-directive listening with Rogers. Cuz-- and this is a very important thing. Is it just good listening, or is it important to be focusing on and evoking the change talk that the client has with which is something that Rogers would not have done? Ah, it, it would-- it sort of violated the sense of being non-directive, you know. So, we ran this-- clients were randomly assigned, ah, to these 222 clients. Same therapists delivering both treatments, so you're controlling for therapist effects. 

00:36:25
Sellman et al (2001) 70 65 60 55 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 42.9 OR-2.62 62.5 OR-2.95 65 % MET NDRI Control Patients Drinking Heavily 

00:36:25
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Six months follow-up and here we are with the percentage of the patients drinking heavily. In the motivational group, 42%-- 43% are drinking heavily. In the, ah, client-centered group, 20-- 63%. And in the control group which is treated as usual, 65%. No, no difference there. So, it was making a difference to do something more than just following people where they're going. The directive component seems to matter. 

00:36:50
How is a decisional balance different? Designed to equally evoke and explore pros and cons Decisional Balance Sheet Status Quo Disadvantages MI Change Advantages MI 

00:36:55
DR. WILLIAM MILLER How is this different from a base-- ah, decisional balance cuz therapists get it mix up with motivational interviewing? A decisional balance originally introduced by Janis and Mann, you try to fill an all-four boxes. What are all the reasons why you wanna change? What are all the less good things about changing? What are all the bad things about how things are? What are all the good things about how things are? And so, if I find this in, in protocols all over the country, well, that's not motivational interviewing. In fact, this country indicated motivational interviewing. In motivational int reviewing, you particularly interested in two of these squares, the, the disadvantage of status quo and the advantages of change. And you, you have disrespect to ignore what client say on the other side. You certainly listen to it and remember it and incorporate it. But you'll not go fishing for all the reasons why people want to stay the same in all the bad things about changing. But you don't do that on suicide prevention line, you know. So, so what would be the good things about killing yourself? You're very focus on these other two boxes, you know. 

00:38:00
An expected outcome of a decisional balance procedure would be: ambivalence! Research consistently shows that with ambivalent people, doing a decisional balance actually decrease commitment to change. Miller, W.R., & Rose, G.S. (in press). Motivational interviewing and decisional balance Contrasting, procedures for responding to client ambivalence. Behavioral and Cognitive Psychotherapy 

00:38:05
DR. WILLIAM MILLER In fact, the expected outcome of a decision balance would be ambivalence. If you're successful and equally evoking pros and cons, you would expect ambivalence and indeed, their research very consistently shows that if you do a decisional balance with ambivalent people, it decreases their commitment to change. This actually countertherapeutic to do when people are ambivalent. Once they've decided, it doesn't hurt them, but when the deciding process actually gets in the way of their moving forward. 

00:38:30
So: ◘ Counsel in a way that helps the person to voice their own motivations for change (pros; change talk) ◘ Respond in a way that minimizes "resistance" and defensiveness, and helps the person to keep exploring the way forward ◘ If you're arguing for change and your client is arguing against it, you've got it exactly backward. Summary of the evidence base Over 200 randomized trials ◘ Average effects in small to medium range ◘ High variability in effect size across studies ◘ High outcome differences among therapists ◘ Site X Treatment interactions ◘ What increases the efficacy of MI? ■ Training and fidelity of MI intervention ■ Non-use of a manual ■ Ethnicity ■ Lower initial readiness to change 

00:38:35
DR. WILLIAM MILLER So, counsel in a way that helps the person to voice their own motivations for change, respond in a way that minimizes resistance or defensiveness doesn't, doesn't increase that. And if you're arguing for change and your client is arguing against it, you're in the wrong chair basically. You gotta do exactly backwards. Well, what's what the evidence-based on this? There are more than 200 randomized clinical trials in the literature now across an amazing array of problem areas, ah, of, of things identified as motivational interviewing. And the average effects across all those studies is in the small to medium range. But there's tremendous variability across studies. There are studies finding absolutely no effect at MI including one of my own laboratory. The very strong differences among therapists, ah, within the same study. You find some therapists who just much better at doing this than others are. And in multi-psyche trials, you find that MI working at some sites and not others. Of course sites are confounded with therapists but, but there's some variability here that we have yet to account for that's kind of interesting. What's associated with the efficacy of motivational interviewing? Well, fidelity of MI. Yeah, so the, you know, the, the better the quality of the therapist doing it, the better the outcome. We found also that, that not using a manual was, was associated with a bigger effect side. That one, there was a manual present. The effect size of one-half compared to studies where the therapist was doing motivational interviewing with no manual, ah, contrary to, to what we often believe about therapist manuals. Ethnicity. The effect size was double in the clients were people of color. Interestingly. And these are Americans studies. But primarily, African-American, Hispanic-American clients, the effect size was double compared to white majority clients. And lower readiness for change also is associated with better efficacy. If your clients already prepared the change and wants to and ready to go, they don't need motivational interviewing for this. You would just go ahead with the, ah, action stage.

00:40:50
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Well, how do clinicians learn motivational interviewing? That's a question that has interested me and this is one last things I wanna share with you. And it all started with a study that I did in, in the Oregon funded by NIDA, ah, whereas we're asked to come in and teach motivational interviewing to staff. And I said. "Well, I'm not sabbatical. But, look, can, can we-- if we can make a study out of it then I'll do it for free. So, what, what I would like is to get, ah, your therapist's fill out questionnaires and audiotapes and work samples for me with real clients before training. Then, I'll commend to do my two-day workshop and I will give more copy of the book, ah, and we'll do an immediate post-training, uhm, interactions with a-- with actors. Ah, I'll come back six times and offer on- site refresher, kind of, ah, how to get better at no MI. And then, three or five months afterwards, I'd like to get tapes again or just audiotapes and, and have people fill out their questionnaires. So, the mi-- the outcomes were self-report of satisfaction. Expertise as judge by observers listening to these tapes. And then, what the clients were doing which we know as a good proxy with outcome. Are you, are you going more change talk? Twenty-two participants, half male, half female, five years of graduate education, 12 years of counseling experience. Uh-hmm. And of the six sessions offered, six follow-up sessions where you can come and learn some more, the mean number attended-- ah, or the model number attended was zero. Ah, and six came to one session and after that, it just kind of evaporated, so therapists were not coming to, ah, to learn more. 

00:42:40
Grasp of MI • I understand the basic ideas and principles **** • I feel proficient and able to use MI**** I am using MI in my work**** 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Pre Post Follow-up Interest in Learning More About MI 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Pre Post Follow-up 

00:42:40
DR. WILLIAM MILLER But on the questionnaires, they said, "Yes, I understand the basics now. I'm proficiently able to use MI and I'm using it in my work. So, if that were our evaluation of the workshop, spectacular success. I, I did have a significant impact on one other thing which was interesting learning more about motivational interviewing. 

00:43:05
[sil.] 

00:43:10
DR. WILLIAM MILLER And why we went back to present this data? I said, "Now, tell me about this." They said, "Oh, yeah. We already learned it so we, we don't to learn more. I know we got it." Oh, okay. 

00:43:15
Was there a change in therapist skill? Global Ratings (example): Overall MI Style Criterion competence Level is 5 7 6 →5 4 3 2 1 0 Pre Post Follow-up 

00:43:20
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Well, was there a change in therapist skill? Nope. I mean, if you, if you torture the data, it might be statistically significant but it-- it's, it's not coming up anywhere in here as the level of proficiency. But these folks, because they can do a two-day workshop with me, figure then out doing it, you know. And the others have no evidence of it on the tapes, you know. 

00:43:45
Was there a change in client response? No significant change in client responses that predict outcome: • Global ratings: Engagement, Cooperation, Benefit, Affect, Disclosure • Change talk • Resistance Slide Note: "Standard client" actors do not behave like actual clients 

00:43:45
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Did their clients respond any differently? Nope. Uh-hmm. No difference in our global ratings or what's going on. No difference in change talk. No difference in resistance levels. By the way, we did learn that actors don't behave like clients do. So, actors come with a role and they don't change that much across different therapists in general. They're kinda portraying a role whereas real clients actually, ah, do respond differently to different styles of, of, ah, intervention. 

00:44:15
A Randomized Trial of Training 140 clinicians randomly assigned to: W: 2-day CP workshop only WF: Workshop + Feedback from practice samples WT: Workshop + 6 Telephone Coaching sessions WFT: Workshop + Feedback and Coaching Miller, W.R., Yahne, C.E., Moyers, T.B., Martinez, J. & Pirritano, M. (2004). A randomized trial of methods to help clinicians learn motivational interviewing. Journal of Counseling and Clinical Psychology. 72, 1050-1062 

00:44:20
DR. WILLIAM MILLER So that made me asked, ah, in my depression. Well, how do people learn motivational interviewing? How do you learn a complex skill? And the way people-- you le-- the way you learn a complex skill like a musical instrument or sport is you get, you get feedback. So, you can't learn archery in the dark. Ah, you, you can't learn golf when it's pitch-black. You have no idea where the thing went, you know. Ah, you can't learn to play the piano if when you strike the keys, you don't hear any sound, you know. It's just, it's just you have the feedback and we usually get a coach to help us, you know. You hire a piano teacher. Say, you, you-- give me your tip here. And, and you don't say, "Don't listen to me. I be to embarrassed if you, if you listen to me." Or, you don't hire a tennis coach and say, "But don't watch me. I could, I could stand if you watch me." You know, the coach used to watch what you're doing and, and make general suggestions. You know, change your grip a little bit, you know. Try this next week and see how that goes, you know. So, we did a randomized trial with 140 clinicians randomly assigned. So, another people randomly assigned or clinicians who wanna learn motivational interviewing. To get my two-day workshop, or a workshop plus feedback from your practice samples. Or, a workshop from coaching, six telephone calls. These folks have all around the country. Half an hour telephone call. We'll always practice on the telephone. We'll always talk about MI. We always practice. The whole enchilada where you get the workshop and feedback and coaching. And then, our, our, ah, waiting list control group, people we sent the book and our training tapes and said, "Watch these and read the book and, and learn this method and come back at four months and we'll see how you're doing." All right. 

00:46:05
Did clinicians learn the treatment method? Percent MI-Consistent Responses 

00:46:05
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Did the clinicians learn? Well, three of the groups came up to a confidence level. Those that got feedback, those that got coaching, and those that got both. All right. So, it's looking pretty good and in that regard and the white line by the way is our waiting list control. After four months, we give them the workshop coaching and feedback and they come up for a proficiency level. The group that never gets there is the group that just got the workshop. 

00:46:35
Do their clients respond differently? Client Change Talk 

00:46:35
DR. WILLIAM MILLER But did their clients respond differently? Cuz actually this is the bottom line. I mean, if you doing cool MI stuff but your clients aren't behaving any differently, so what, you know? Well, there's only one group whose clients show dramatically more change talk, and that was the group to got the workshop plus training plus coaching plus feedback. You need those things to learn a complex skill like psychotherapy, you know. 

00:47:05
A Causal Chain that Works Training in MI MI-Consistent Practice (including empathy) Change Talk ↑ Sustain Talk ↓ Behavior Change 

00:47:10
DR. WILLIAM MILLER So, we got a pretty good causal chain which in unusual in psychotherapy as you may know. When we, we know now that when we teach people motivational interviewing in a, in a new model not like the one I was doing before, that we see increases in proficiency particularly when you include feedback and coaching, all right? And, and, ah, and increases empathy as well, you know, because I think doing this changes you. When you begin to practice what Rogers taught us and the kinds of things we emphasized in motivational interviewing, it changes you. You'd become a more accepting and empathic and peaceful person I find. MI-consistent practice predicts increase change talk and decrease sustain talk and that predicts behavior change. And that predicts behavior change. So, all, all the those links in the, in the chain are working. 

00:48:00
Nonspecific Factors? Is a therapist skill like accurate empathy: ◘ A Non-specific Factor? ■ It is possible, measurable, teachable ■ It predicts client outcome ◘ A General Factor? ■ It is truly present in all therapies and therapists? ◘ A Common Factor? ■ How common is it, really? ◘ To call such factors "non-specific" just means that we haven't done our work! 

00:48:05
DR. WILLIAM MILLER Now, what about non-specific factors then? Because a, a lot of what we do in motivational interviewing is what might be called general factors and non-specific factors. We're doing a lot of Rogers. So, let's think about empathy. Is empathy a non-specific factor? Well, in a way if you call something non-specific, it means we haven't done our homework. We've been sloppy. We haven't specified what it is that we're talking about. And empathy is specifiable. It is reliably measurable. To expert coders can listen to a tape and agree about the level of empathy that's present there. And it's learnable. A very broad range people can, can learn the skill of accurate empathy that Rogers described. And it predicts client's outcome. So, it's not exactly non-specific, you know. Is it general factor? Meaning is it, is it always present in therapy and therapists? Uh-ah. If you've listened to tapes, you know that. Is it a common factor? Well, I'm not sure how common it is actually in, in therapy as practice, you know. So, what we're trying to do in a way with motivational interviewing is specify and teach things that had been dismissed as common general non-specific factors. Because if these are the things that really make a difference in client outcome, and I believe they do, we ought to be paying attention to them, understanding how they work, and teaching them. Yup. 

00:49:25
"Specific" and "Nonspecific" For "specific" factors ◘ We need to determine which technical aspects of a therapy really matter and which are superfluous For "nonspecific" factors ◘ We need to determine which general aspects of therapy really matter And do the work to specify, measure, study, and teach them to the next generation 

00:49:25
DR. WILLIAM MILLER So, is it specific factors or non-specific factors? We have this raging debates about its specific stuff or non-specific stuff. Well, I mean, that's not in either were question to me. It's a both end question. When I go to see my health care provider with a life threatening illness as I did, I want that provider to be reading the journals and using the methods that have the best evidence of efficacy, knowing all the shortcomings of medical research and so forth. Still, I read the medical trials, too. I wanted, I wanted to do the thing that was most likely to help. And, and why would we not to that in psychotherapy? And also, we know that these things that we haven't specified well like therapeutic relationship and empathy or huge determinants of client outcome as well. And we should be doing a good job or training those in our training programs and teaching people how to put them together with evidence-based approaches like cognitive behavior therapy. Because you can do that. You can do behavior therapy in an authoritarian way. You can do it a Rogerian way. I mean, it's what, you know-- why not, why not put these things together? 

00:50:30
So which is more important? 

00:50:30
DR. WILLIAM MILLER And in a way, it's like asking which of these is more important? Is it, is it-- in, in, ah, racing, is it, is it the car or is it the driver, you know? In, in, in food, in cooking, is, is the excellence of what is done, is it, is it the cook or is it the ingredients, you know? Ah, the light of the candle goes, it is that the candle, or is it the flame, you know? Well, of course, it's both. Of course it's both. Both things are very important. And, and it is their combination that, that is the magic to what we do.

After 30 years of research we have a clinical method that is: ◘ Evidence-based ◘ Relatively brief >200 clinical trials ◘ Specifiable (but be careful with manuals) ◘ Grounded in a testable theory ◘ With specifiable mechanisms of action ◘ Verifiable - Is it being delivered properly? ◘ Generalilzable across problem areas ◘ Complementary to other treatment methods ◘ Learnable by a broad range of providers

DR. WILLIAM MILLER So, after 30 years of working on this since 1983, we got a clinical method that has a pretty good evidence-based. It's got lots of randomized trials. It's relatively brief. I mean, it-- you don't do motivational interviewing for 90 sessions. I mean, it's, it's, it's something that is relatively short. And one of the real surprises early was quickly people change when you do this. And, uhm, how can it be that people have been practicing a habit for 10 or 20 years? And you have a conversation with them sometimes 15 minutes in primary care and the thing turns a quarter. I mean, that is, that is weird, you know. We can te-- we can teach you to do it specifiable, but watch out for manuals. Manuals are a little too restrictive. If, if you paying more attention to the manual and your client, you're not doing it right. If you're following a sequence of steps in the manual, you're not paying attention to your client. Hmm. There's a testable theory finally after 30 years, ah, about what the underlying mechanisms are of chain. We understand something about that. We can listen to tapes and say whether it's happening or not and how well it's happening. It's generalizable across than amazing array of problems start out with addictions moved in to health care. Because people who diagnose with diabetes are also ambivalent about changing. You have hypertension, you have asthma, you, you know, you just need to do some things differently. And the biggest problem is people don't do that, you know. Ah, then we move into corrections, probation, you know. Ah, then move it to dentistry, taking care of your oral health, you know. And then, to education. And, and finally, it has come around the psychotherapy. Last of all where I started. Yeah, so it happened. And it's complementary to other treatment programs. You don't have to be converted to motivational interviewing. This is a tool. It's not a comprehensive theory of change in psychotherapy. It's just a tool to put in your toolbox and use along with the other things that you do to amplify the efficacy of you're doing. David, David, uhm, Burns, we're just talking about this very thing yesterday. And it can be learned by a broad range of providers. We've, we've looked at years of education. We've trained paraprofessionals and professionals of all kinds and we've never found a relationship between years of education and the ability to do this. So the good news for you is even people with an advanced degrees can learn this.
