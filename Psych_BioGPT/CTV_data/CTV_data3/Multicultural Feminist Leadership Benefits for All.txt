MARIE L. MIVILLE Now Doctor Vasquez has a long history with the roundtable being one of the first recipients of the Janet E. Helms mentoring award. Among her many, many accomplishments, she also helped to found the APA division 45 that is the home division in the American Psychological Association for people of color. She was also the co-founder along with my colleague Dr. Su, and Dr. Rosie Benjamin, of the nation multicultural summit which just celebrated, it's 12th year, this year. Now Doctor Vasquez has published prestigiously over 70 publication and counting. And she is a fellow of 10 divisions. Uh… Most of us are happy just to be 1 or 2 divisions fellows, she is a fellow in 10. And as APA president, Dr. Vasquez brought together in major task force who're the first ever looking at immigration and diversity, emphasizing the resilience and resource from this of immigrant people. Yeah, when I invited Doctor Vasquez to be our key note speaker, I'll tell you she responded so quickly and I could just hear the warmth and enthusiasm coming through her email. And so I'm so excited to welcome for all of you Dr. Vasquez.

MELBA VASQUEZ Well good morning, I am incredibly honored to be here uh… this morning. Congratulations on the 30th anniversary of the Teachers College, Columbia, Winter Roundtable. I'm thrilled that your theme is Honoring Our Legacy And Empowering Future Leaders, leadership is a topic of significant interest in me. Uh… I really do believe that leadership is an important goal. Uh… I believe that it's an important goal for all professionals regardless of the directions in which those skills might be applied. Participation in leadership helps individuals, maximize potential, increase productivity, shape a positive culture and promote harmony. I'm delighted that there are so many students in the audience because I hope to inspire you to think about leadership in whatever context you end up being that. Umm… In addition leaders have the potential to have tremendous influence on the "personality" of a system or in organization. One person can sometimes make a difference. I believe that leadership is a particularly important goal for women and men of color and for representatives of other diverse groups. Leaders can promote positive changes in institutional and organizational life, and may bring unique skills, values, and perspectives to their leadership activities. Women and members of non-white racial and ethnic groups have slowly gained access to leadership positions in society, Dr Johnson what describing what it was like 30, 35 years ago, and we've come a long way. However, women, persons of color including women of color remained under represented as leaders related to their numbers in the population. So a current challenge is to increase the diversity, number and effectiveness of people from diverse backgrounds with multiple identities as leaders. And to encourage their desire, skills, experience, and vision to be change agents in their communities. Uh… I see you as future leaders. Opportunities for leadership must be created, and strategies must be provided to ensure that women and men of color have the knowledge, skills and attitudes, necessary to compete for a variety of positions in leadership seeing your management positions, despite barriers, despite challengers. So I'm going to talk about these issues. The review of the literature also addresses the question as to whether multicultural leaders have unique leadership qualities. Well, I believe in leadership representation by various groups, I'm going to focus specifically on gender and culture. Why did culture and gender matter for a leadership? Ayman and Korabik reviewed major theories in models of leadership and concluded that the complexity of the various approaches toward uh… to leadership umm… in describing rather than. Culture and identity variables that can affect a leader style, behavior, emergence, and effectiveness in many different ways, many complex ways. Gender role identities and cultural values can affect the choices that they make about the manner in which they live. Will give you an example, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor had to tone down her wise Latina statement when she was being considered uh… Supreme Court Justice, do you remember that? Yeah. Somebody gave me a T-Shirt that said Wise Latina, must be careful while wearing. Justice Sotomayor was in Austin, Texas a couple of weeks ago. She was promoting her book My Beloved World which by the way has been on the New York Times bestseller list number one for the last two weeks. Good for her, right? In one of her interviews she made a very touching comment. She said that poor…that people perceived poor neighborhoods as riddled with crime. She indicated that in fact the majority, the vast majority of poor people are hard working people with dignity, goodness, and there were contributing members of the society. Now we all know that. But a lot of people don't. And to have a Supreme Court Justice who knows this reality, and to articulate it on television is so important. Having people with the lived experiences of this kind of background in position… positions of leadership is critical. When someone with her position of authority makes that statement it has impact. Another of the Supreme Court Justice, Sandra Day O'Connor, former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor conveyed her belief that diversity in leadership is a compelling interest. During the 2003 Supreme Court affirmative action decisions allowing consideration of race to ensure that there is a critical mass of racial and ethnic minority applicants in higher education, the University of Michigan. Justice O'Connor declared that it was important and necessary to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry. A university education is important she believed. So that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented individuals of every race and ethnicity. She believes that universities are partly in the business of training a leadership Corps for society, and that every society with racial and ethnic tensions can benefit tremendously from having an integrated leadership. This perspective of firms with judicial authority the existing national consensus that the presence of diversity in leadership positions in society is compelling. Unfortunately the allowance of affirmative action is once again before the Supreme Court just 10 years later and the APA, the American Psychological Association and other organizations have presented position papers on this in favor. We'll hear a judgment this summer. Umm… You know, if it weren't a affirmative action I would not be here. I would not have been in graduate school. A lot of people associated negative stigma with affirmative action saying , you're not competent, you're an affirmative action umm… recruit or hire or whatever. Rather affirmative action consists of strategies used to identify talent that would not otherwise present itself. So the presence of diverse leaders in society can be significant. I'm glad I'm not the first one to present a picture of President Barack Obama, I didn't know that it was okay to be political, you know, around here. But other side it didn't matter because I'm talking about it from a psychological… I'm doing psychological analyses up here, I can't say anything. So umm… so on May 9th, 2012, umm… last May while he was running for president, uh… United States President Barack Obama made an historic announcement when he endorsed same sex marriage. President Obama is the first sitting president to argue that homosexual men and women should be granted the same rights as heterosexuals. He took the risk to lose support and to be a true champion of change by putting the moral power of his presidency behind a social issue that is controversial in this country. The president decided to do so because he believed it was right and because he believes so strongly in civil rights. He described his evolution from supporting civil unions to supporting marriage equality for all. He reiterated this belief in his inauguration speech along with rights for women's equal pay and other civil rights umm… umm… initiatives. After President Obama's initial declaration about uh… marriage rights, uh… on the Chris Matthew show the journalist for the Daily Beast, Newsweek columnist Andrew Sullivan who by the way I heard he is a republican interesting leaders, yeah, very movingly spoke of how he heard our president tell him as a gay man that he was no longer outside but fully apart of this family quote. He further said that he had never fully understood the power of the president's words before. He was overwhelmed and then on the Chris Matthews Show he was in tears, he was at a loss for words, he was very moving. This is one of my favorite pictures. When someone like someone with whom we identify takes on a position of leadership, it makes a difference to our identity, that sense of work are possibilities. The story behind this is that umm… one of uh… Obama's staff persons a former Marine was leaving after working there for a while and the custom is for President Obama to meet with the leaving staff person in the family and take pictures what he did that and then the father asked Obama each of my sons has a question for you, are you okay… would you be willing to answer the questions? And Obama said of course. So this little boy who was eight years old at that time umm… first asked his question very, very softly, no one could hear and President Obama said, "Pardon, would you repeat that?" And so he repeated the question he said, "Is your hair like mine?" And President Obama bend down and said, "Well touch it. What do you think?" Little boy was reluctant and Obama said, "Go ahead, touch it." So he did, what a wonderful picture they captured with that. He's one of us… seen a family of colored in the White House is certainly something that many of us never expected to see in our life time, especially those of us who were my age or older, right Samuel? It is joyful to celebrate. Regardless of your political orientation you have to know that it is psychologically powerful event in the lives of people of color, Beyonce's having heyday, isn't she? She's wonderful. Clearly people of color and members other diverse groups can have… can take courageous advocacy positions that make a difference in society in the context of which they provide leadership. You know we have we have a President Obama right there, and we have Beyonce, an incredible entertainer who is also providing leadership in her own way. On a much lesser scale I had similar opportunities as president of the American Psychological Association, let me share a little bit about my personal experience when I served as the first Latina and first woman of color president of the APA uh… for 2011 I was able to designate social justice as a major theme for the annual APA convention in August of 2011 in Washington D.C. Umm… I got I got wonderful feedback for that, you know, what one of the things about being an APA president is you're very, very nervous about three things. You're nervous about running the two meetings of the Council of Representatives. The Council of Representatives as the governing body of the American Psychological Association consists of a 170 psychologists representing divisions and state Psychological Associations. Now have you ever tried running a meeting with a 170 people for three, two and a half days, it's like herding wild cats, real cats. Uh… so those two things you're nervous about the third thing you're nervous about is the APA convention because, you know, a lot of what you do umm.. gets represented there but some of the feedback for example I had a young African-American psychologist come up to me and said Dr Vasquez I want to shake your hand, he said, I've been a psychologist for ten years and I came to APA as a graduate student and there was nothing here for me. So I didn't come back until this year when I saw what your themes were and he said, this is not my grandfather's conference. Umm… And then the and the other example was uh… when Jim and I would be here at the airport leaving at the end I was pleasantly tired and just so happy with the way things had gone and there happened to be an elderly African-American man a few people behind me and he said, Dr Vasquez, he said, I want you to know that I've been retired for a while and I had decided not to attend any more APA conventions but I came to this one and I want you to know that it has made me very optimistic for the future, and so just those two examples made the whole thing worth it. Some of the presidential projects and initiatives Marie mentioned one of them, included task forces to examine psychologies perspectives on grand challenges and society including reducing and preventing discrimination, educational disparities and immigration. The results included the following reports they're all available on the APA website one of them is pathways to a better America preventing discrimination and promoting diversity. Ethnic and racial disparities in education, psychologist contributions to understanding and reducing disparities, and Crossroads, the psychology of immigration in the new century, these are the visible outcomes. You have to know when you get on the board of directors as either a member at large or as an officer it allows for many, many, many, many behind the scenes influences. And sometimes one person can make a difference. These reports in particular uh…I want to mention a little bit more about them were authored by several very hard working expert researchers. They were reviewed by advisors many other people beyond umm… the task force members reviewed them and gave us input. They were vetted by the APA's boards and committees which consists of over 300 people, and they were received as official APA reports by that 170 person council representatives. Uh… Because of the strength and salience of these evidence based resources we have already held congressional briefings in Washington D.C. with the help and support of the APA government relation staff on the very important and timely topic of immigration for example. Umm… The representative Raúl Grijalva from Arizona, anybody here from Arizona? Okay, so uh… Well, we all know about the regressive immigration laws in that state, he is very concerned about immigration and representative Grace Napolitano from California and were instrumental in making briefings possible including the latest one last May, our primary goal was to provide the current state of psychological scientific proof and professional knowledge about the experience of immigration especially given the widespread negative views of immigration reported in the media. Umm… Here, here I am with the Grace Napolitano and one of the panels, I also want to point out the task force members of the three reports. They worked so hard. They included for the immigration report Carola Suarez-Orozco has served as a chair, Dina Birman , Manuel Casas, Nadine Nakamura, Praty Tummala-Narra, and Michael Zárate. Each of the task force members presented to some posed at the APA convention each of the three task forces did that. The immigration task force members also presented a program at the Texas Psychological Association last fall and a few weeks ago at the National multicultural conference and summit Nadine, Praty, Michael and I presented at the summit. Umm… You know Michael mentioned as he spoke last couple weeks ago. He said it was, he said he served on several boards and committees and task forces and it was the most wonderful experience ever for him. One of the things that happens about these activities as you develop sometimes lifelong friendships umm… with people especially with people whom we share, research, interests and values. The task force on preventing discrimination and promoting diversity produced a report that to reduce and prevent destructive discrimination. The task force members included James Jones as chair, Susan Cochran, Michelle Fine, who will be on In understand the elders panel tomorrow morning, Sam Gaertner, Rudy Mendoza, Margaret Shih, and our own Derald Wing Sue. Uh… Again as with all the task forces the, the many of them have years of research and scholarship on the topic, there were a few early career professionals like Nadine Nakamura the umm…. uh… Immigration Task Force who had expertise with umm… homosexuality and immigration as well as gender issues but they all can say contributed considerable time and talent. Finally the task force on educational disparities tried to provide information about the impact of educational disparities on racial ethnic minorities and to identify factors that contribute to those disparities, all the reports included strategies and recommendations to address the challenges is the wonderful resource, I hope each and every one of you goes online to access them. So this particular task force included Steve Quintana as chair, Wade Boykin, Sandra Graham, and Andrew Fuligni, Sam Ortiz, and Frank Worrell. So as men and women of color take our places as leaders in our respective communities, institutions, and organizations, we may be able to have significant impact on issues important to society. And the little leadership literature it is clear that a masculine why Western leadership prototype has prevailed. Umm… About five or six years ago the American psychologist had a special issue on leadership and every single author was male and all the models were of this type. There was protest and so there were umm… Gene Shan, and Alice Eagly and others put together another special issue on leadership on women. But the low social status as even, even, even in this day and time we forget were our mentality so socialize to think about leadership and, and that white western leadership model and that we, we just forget. The low social status ascribed to leaders who are women and people of color can result in a devaluation of their accomplishments by others. The implicit stereotypes of leadership in the traditional role associated with women and people of color can lead to a higher level of scrutiny and challenge of the legitimacy of their authority. Part of my anxiety, if I didn't get elected president of APA was that I would be observed with a microscope and I had tremendous anxiety about not wanting to shame my community, not wanting to fall on my face, umm… and I can't tell you how much I celebrated at the end of my presidency because that only had a couple of minor stumbles, you know, flat fall on my face, the police that I knew bad. So Ayman and Korabik point out that the image of leadership has been evolving, lately there is more recognition of the importance of people skills for leaders but feminization of leadership with a move toward more inclusion of women and ethno cultural minorities in the workplace has led to a more androgynous conception of leadership. Globalization has resulted in the influence of Asian management styles which have been noted to be highly effective and to be more relationship focused, and a more androgynous conceptualization of leadership with equal emphasis of both task and people skills will open up more opportunities for women and ethno cultural minorities to be considered as leaders. The conclusion is that examination of the effects of gender and culture has the potential to change our definition of what constitutes effect of leadership with a more inclusive conceptualization it represents all human beings. You know I've been umm… I am a former president of division 17 society of counseling psychology and umm… the division in the past decade with the beginning of Rosie Benjamin, Philips and including Derald Wing Sue umm… has become more multicultural feminist and even the white males who have been elected president, nicely punky hamper sitting out in the audience, he's one of the former presidents in the past decade I think had been more androgynous. Umm… uh… We, we did a leadership institute for grad students and early career professionals last month right after the summit for division 17, and one of the white males there was very anxious, he said, I don't know if I fit here because it was focused on diversity leadership, and we said, somebody said to him one of the faculty members said, actually you remind me of Punky Hepner (ph), and that's a very good thing. Punky, be sure you're saying a little Punky, he is one of our androgynous leaders. Umm… Cheung and Halpern proposed an alternative model to the usual notion of a western male as the ideal leader, the model includes relationship oriented leadership traits, the importance of teamwork and consensus building and ineffective work family interface that women with family care responsibilities create and use to break through the glass ceiling, this model is highly applicable for women of color in fact Cheung and Halpern applied across cultural perspective derived from collectivistic cultures. Uh… They did research in China and a couple of Latin American countries which they described as supplementing models of leadership based on men. So one of the questions that comes up is do people who are diverse have unique leadership qualities. Well what we know so far is that research indicates differences in leadership styles but not in leadership effectiveness between men and women, and evidence demonstrates that female leaders are effective as leaders according to Eagly. Umm… There are many ways to be an effective leader. I remember early in my career thinking I could never do that because I'm not like that. And had to realize you don't have to do it like that. There are many different ways to do uh… leadership there are many different ways to do all kinds of things. The value is there typically feminine traits of cooperation, mentoring and collaboration were highlighted by Eagly. Women tend to be social and democratic leaders, and men tend to be tasked leaders. Met analyses of studies of the leadership styles of women and men have demonstrated that uh… women have a somewhat more androgynous democratic and participative leadership style than men, perhaps partly, because people resist women who take charge in a particularly assertive manner, what do they call us if we do then? Oh we know what they call us! Okay. So female leaders in order to survive their roles tend to be somewhat more transformational in their leadership style than male leaders especially in mentoring and developing colleagues. Women also tend to adopt a more positive managerial approach that trades on rewards rather than a negative approach that trades on reprimands. Although a minimal amount of research has been conducted with women of color, those of you looking for dissertations identity variables can affect a leader style behavior, emergence, and effectiveness in many complex ways. Eagerly and Shin pointed out that typical differences in the leadership styles of women and men are quite small when they occupy the same managerial role. The differences are quite small when they're actually in the same roles. The ways that women and men differ from the ways that women differ from men in leadership style are generally associated with good managerial practices in current day organizations for example scholars of leadership have increasingly emphasized that effective leadership emerges from inspiring, motivating, and mentoring followers rather then top down command and control leaders. So multicultural diverse leaders have much to offer, but there are also challenges and barriers. Research has confirmed theoretical uh… perspectives as to why women and men of color in particular are under represented in leadership positions with the rise for years of discrimination is a problem. Well, we now have research to confirm them. So discrimination by the majority population including bias and negative stereotyping on the part of those in power, as well as structural, systemic, discrimination are the root causes of differential treatment as reflected in policies and practices in the social system. It's believed that these processes is account for continued low representation of women people of color and especially women of color in leadership positions. This discrimination has been described symbolically by the terms glass ceiling a concept to popularize in the 1980s by Hymowitz and Schellhard to describe a barrier so subtle that it's transparent yet so strong that it prevents women and minorities from moving up in the management hierarchy. Also the term labyrinth, a term used by Eagly and Carli to describe the uneven path of upward progression for women in organizations involving challenges in direct for ratings and ventures into foreign territory. Others describe increase to barriers posed by the sexism and racism that women of color encounter and use symbolic term such as concrete wall or sticky floor. Research has demonstrated the differences in educational levels, training, job experience and occupational segregation account for only a portion of the gender and race gaps in wages and promotion and that discrimination is a contributing factor. Despite convincing evidence of the effectiveness of female leaders they face several barriers and challenges. Unfortunately, the evidence indicates that people both men and women report preferences for male bosses. It's more difficult for women to be promoted into leadership roles than it is for men. It is more difficult for women to be perceived as effective leaders than it is for men. And leadership challenges are higher for women of color than for white women and men. Studies have shown that discrimination is especially potent against mothers and African-Americans. Indeed one of the grand challenges inside involves the dilatoriness effects of biased study types and discrimination that results the enormous toll on human capital remember that presidential report that addresses these issues these issues include strategies for change. In psychology for example, although women leave the field they do so in numbers only. Although they hold three fourths of the fields new doctorates they make up only 39 percent of tenured faculty, and only 49 percent of graduate department faculty according to the APA Center for Workforce studies, now there's a new report pf the Center for Workforce studies due out I think of the end of this year. We'll see if there's improvement on that. Only umm… 15 of 124 presidencies of the APA have been women that includes uh… maybe council will be president next year, and only one as I said earlier umm… as Marie said when she introduced me has been a woman of color. In this day and age, we need more. Okay, I want to show you the list of all the women APA presidents. We had one in okay we've been, we've… APA has been around since I believe 1891. Umm… We had in the first quarter century if so we had two women and then in the 70's we had Anne Anastasi and Leona Tyler, was actually an interesting one because in 1971 we had an African-American as well Kim Clark. In the 80s we have three women but only one in the 90s. Three in the 2000s and interestingly when I was elected president I was the second women in a row and then we had three women in a row for the first time ever. So for the, for the last, you know, for these decade so far we have four out of five, five women. We've done little better, uh? Umm… The percentage of women board of directors, the board of directors sort of the officers of the Council of Representatives. And you see that change there umm… when I got my doctorate in 1978. So less than ten percent of the Board of Directors were women and uh…in two… 2012 and 13 by the way those, those figures hold that percentage of women are members. Council representatives you can see we're not doing quite as well but almost, almost 50 percent umm… are women. Umm… In terms of men and women of color in APA umm… we have as I mentioned Kenneth Clark umm… can you believe in there been almost 125 years only have four people of color. Umm… Kenneth Clark was president in 1971. You remember Kenneth Clark is Kenneth and may, may Clark part did the research on the black dolls, white dolls where both black and white girls chose the white doll and he used this research to demonstrate in 1954 Topeka versus umm… board, yes, yeah, thank you. Board of education, umm… are what was that uh… let me see what was it, Brown versus Topeka, thank you, Brown versus Topeka, the 1954 desegregation, kind of desegregated schools umm… his, his research…. He presented his research before the Supreme Court indicate that, that indicated uh… poor self-esteem umm… and so umm… interestingly he was honored umm… by, by his research being so salient in this key umm… umm… decision and yet he was elected president till 1971, umm… 15years later Native American Logan Wright was elected and then 13years later Dick Suinn was elected and umm… umm… 12 years after that I was elected. That is too long a time in between. We need more leaders at that level. The tendency to have a good diverse representation in education in mid-level management but not top levels holds true in the corporate world and in comparable top levels uh… in non-corporate settings, political office or academic settings, multiple reasons account for this troubling reality. Umm… So we tend to stay stuck at the mid-levels. Umm… And uh… that's an interesting thing. This is why the election, and then the second election of President Barack Obama is such a huge deal, huge, huge deal. In addition to discrimination as a major challenge to access to leadership negative stereotypes, great bias and discrimination discriminatory behavior and can also undermine the confidence of the individuals from those groups and lead to self fulfilling prophecies. Stereotype threat which is the fear of performing under the threat of possibly confirming the stereotype about your group which can lead to under performing even when one has the abilities to perform well, I had to manage my stereotype threat quite a bit. Stereotype threat another destructive tendencies can be discouraged to support, confidence building, mentoring, skill development and other related strategies. And I'll talk more about these strategies in a little bit. Women in general and women in color of color in particular may have a tendency to not consider leadership roles until they are fully prepared. They wait they hold back their even concerned about speaking up unless they're sure they're absolutely right. In both governments at all 2001 study of Latina leaders as well as in Cheung and Halpern's 2010 studies, the women they interviewed reported a pattern of unintended leadership development in the early stages of their careers none of the women who had high positions planned on making it to the top of their profession. This is certainly true for me it took encouragement from a variety of people for over a 10 year period for the possibility for running for APA president to take hold in my mind. Women especially women of color are typically more isolated as leaders without mentors or a network of support, and may be less able to garner the help that they may need when facing heightened challenges. Umm… One for example, I have a client I mean full time in a kind of practice in Austin, Texas. And so I see a variety of different clients, one of my clients is a very successful cor… has a very successful corporate role and got ready to retire and she had observed how her peers got what they call the golden parachutes, you know, special umm… sort of positions or boards and so one when they umm… umm… retired they did none of them for her, none of them for her, very painful, very, very painful. One colleague described her lonely experience as being on the outer edge of the inner circle, in other words you break into the inner circle but you're left on the outer edge, you're not really included. So even though a women of color for example may hold official leaders, a positions of leadership status and prestige she may also have the lonely experience of not really being accorded the respect value and inclusion of those of her white male peers, add another client who umm… was included in the top corporate group and she went to her first board meeting and the materials that were handed out had left off her name. Umm… you know, and one of the board members of which she was, you know, her, her group was uh… had the board member uh… asked her to umm… get them some coffee, so there was… the… these kinds of micro aggressions happen often because they don't expect us to be included. Umm… atleast one other woman of color was on the board every year that I served at, I feel very, very, very lucky about that. I was never totaling lonely. Umm… Jessica Henderson Daniel was on the board of directors when I got on, Rosie Felix Benjamin ran for board of directors she said, so she could hang out with me, that was nice. She's amazing. Uh… Jennifer Kelley and Joe Johnson were also on the board of directors at the same time that I was on and there were allies, there are often quite allies as well. Staff members if you're involved in APA uh… on a board or committee you find that there are incredibly talented staff members who can be very supportive both in terms of content and skill and emotional support as well. And I have to tell you that if you haven't met Norman Andersen having him the CEO partly influence my decision to take the risk. He is our first African-American umm… CEO of APA. One of the challenges for women is that reflected by the evidence that women are sometimes assigned positions that have high risk and that potentially set them up for failure. They're appointed after the firm or organization experiences performance and then are blamed for the firm's decline uh… what was actually set in motion before they took the leadership role. One thing, you know, when I do these presentations I'm constantly tweaking and one of the things I thought about this morning as an additional challenge that I forgot and will include if I ever do this again is the issue of backlash, one of the things that happens in society in social psychologists write about this is that when umm… diverse people get too prominent in leadership there's a backlash, there's a high feeling of threat umm… and umm… they're threatened by the differences in the loss of power, perceived loss of power and anxiety makes people behave badly both on an individual basis well as a group base. Okay, so let me talk about strategies for effective leadership. This is sort of optimistic. Okay, so umm… Jessica Henderson Daniel and I wrote a chapter on mentoring umm… and we talked about some of these strategies umm… to help increase the capability, motivations, and leadership goals of women and men of color. Mentoring is a significant intervention in organizations. It's a means of leadership development and a key factor in success. People have been negatively stereotyped particularly require positive optimistic mentor, supervisor, employee relationships, employee relationships. Unfortunately a much has been written about the challenges for people of color to obtain mentoring, supervisors tend to naturally mentor people similar to themselves, including along the variables of gender and ethnicity and race unless they intentionally reach out. So intentional commitment to providing mentoring to people of color is important. Supervisors and mentors must have optimism about their mentee's potential, and they must communicate this fundamental non ambivalent believe in their supervising mentee employees ability. One of the lessons learned from me is how important it is to take the time to articulate an appreciation for someone strains. If people had not done that with me I would not have grown into the believe that I could continue to aspire to positions. So how often do we see something that we respect or admire and not saying anything about it. We need to articulate that feedback. Constructive criticism a compliment by the expectation of high standards are also important along with the expression of confidence in the person's ability to lead. Those who mentor must conceptualize intelligence and related abilities as expandable or incremental qualities that are increased by training and experience. Because of the FM MRI research that we've had over the past decade and a half we know that intelligence is not static. The expectations that one can increase abilities are important to inculcate in one study because of concern that African-American students tended to obtain lowest grades in their white counterparts even with equivalent test scores they were taught to consider intelligence as expandable and malleable. Rather than as a fixed capacity as we had all been taught before, the students who changed how they thought about intelligence in response to training reported greater enjoyment of the academic process, they were able to increase their engagement in their education and obtain higher grade point averages than their counterparts into control groups. This is thus a method to help people resist stereotype threat, the phenomenon that can impair performance when a member of a group is faced with a negative stereotype about their group's performance, we can rise to the occasion. Provision of actual leadership training such as attendance to leadership institutes can also be considerably helpful. Other organizational strategies to facilitate leadership, development for women of color and other diverse groups include creation of environments with an emphasis on cooperation as, as opposed to competition. In addition an environment where diversity is respected and celebrated can also facilitate openness to varied levels and models of women's leadership. So one of the lessons that I learned about discrimination and micro aggressions is that people are complex, umm… we are all relatively guilty of committing micro aggressions, that's really true. We all make mistakes. Umm… And so one of the things that I learned along the way in working with people in APA over a 30 year period is that someone whose name I have drawn a line through could actually change five or ten years later. And I think sometimes that is affected by the change in organizations, by the messages that are given by systems where diversity is appreciated, people can change. So when people commit micro aggressions take note, but don't draw a line through their name necessarily. It's surprising sometimes how people can come from. Let me mention personal strategies that I recommend for each and every one of you umm… to develop leadership skills abilities and qualities, they include risk taking, taking the risk to pursue goals such as developing more skills, obtaining credentials, or applying for leadership positions is an important strategy that can result in development of confidence. The only way to develop confidence is to take risks. Special skill development for leadership qualities umm… for leadership includes how to set career goals, manage time and resources learning to do that it's an ongoing process, find and provide mentorship, balance family and work life learn how to do that, that's also an on going process. Learn about money management, financial and budgetary strategies and negotiating raises, these are also important leadership skills that can be learned it's very difficult for, for women especially for people of color to negotiate raises, to negotiate money, it's very challenging you have to develop… you have to almost desensitize ourselves to be willing to talk about money. Risk taking is involved in the willingness to develop those skills to take risks one must be willing to face and transcend fear and umm… you know, fear doesn't go away just need to learn how to lean into that anxiety move through it. Doing so can help build positive aspect of our identities taking action, taking action is one of the best anti-anxiety strategies there is. Persistence is an important variable that determine success and achievement knowing when to persist but also when to adjust goals and expectations is an important evolving skill. Only those who are persistent with goals and pursuits make progress but at times unattainable goals are toxic environments mainly to depression, anxiety, and despair. President Barack Obama in a commencement speech last May to women's Barnard College graduates encourage patience, commitment, and perseverance. He said and I quote, "Remember that making your mark in the world is hard, it takes patience, it takes commitment, it comes with plenty of said backs and it comes with plenty of failures. And if you fight for your seat at the table and you set a better example and you persevere in what you decide to do with your life you will succeed. Without ongoing support it's difficult to remember that mistakes are a part of life. The fear of confirming negative stereotypes can result in shame and embarrassment when we make mistakes. We each have varying capacities to learn from mistakes, correct what we can, and move on without allowing mistakes to define us. Remember Barack Obama's first debate? You know, I thought he good… did well but I'm selectively pursuing. Umm… But, you know he came right back to me, knowing how to transform hurt, pain, rejection, into positive constructive energies and importantly another important skill to develop. Support others who make mistakes, work hard, be as prepared as possible umm… one of my biggest sources of anxiety was of making mistakes in running meetings, I… I've mentioned that earlier umm… especially the council of representatives in February and then in August and also the six board of directors meetings plus three more board of directors meetings, so one of the things I learned was prioritize, prioritize tasks to lower that anxiety I… I made it a point to read the agenda very carefully especially being prepared for those items I was expected to be responsible forward any given time. Umm… I… you know whenever I looked at the agenda ahead of time and said we need more information about this context staff make sure they have it for you ahead of time. I read uh… the parliamentarian procedure that's used in APAs key see and so I got that little book early on and read it every time I had a council meeting to run. So that I mean it would be fresh and have those rules right in front of me even, even though I had a parliamentarian to help me. I also needed to know. Umm… I learned by serving on the board of directors that staff helps considerably. Uh… one of the things I decided to do when I was encouraged to run for APA President was to run for the APA board of directors first, I served as a member at large for three years. It gave me a bird's eye view of what the president did. I was I watched them very carefully three people, three years that I was on that board uh… and, and saw I saw that staff helps considerably when you're president, they keep track of the agenda for the meeting including for counsel you literally get a script prepared for each item that I can read and umm… you know, umm… it's true in general that APA staff helps. And if you make mistakes you just move on. My favorite example of someone who made mistakes and ended up landing on his feet as Bill Clinton, right. Talk about, talk about a public global shame and when you had that affair. Okay, so engage in self care remember that you're the only one who can ensure that you prioritize exercise, the research shows that that makes a huge difference in quality of life health and mental health can help with stress anxiety, depression management, eat healthily and work on maintaining the good balance of work rest and leisure activities. Women in particular have a tendency to nurture others and must learn how to apply the same standard of care that they provide to others to themselves. Remember that Cheung and Halpern in studies have developed and expanded model of leadership that operates in a culture of gender that expects man and women to be leaders. It highlights the importance of relational orientation and work family integration. Women leaders interviewed in several of Cheung and Halpern studies all cited the importance of their family support in making it to the top. They describe women leaders who married and had families to embrace both their families and work roles. They adopt strategies to redefine their roles. They learn to let go and hire out for household tasks just as they would outsource work in a busy office. They do not have to do it all themselves in fact it's impossible to do it all at the same time. With collective identities that emphasize family loyalty, they relied on some combination of supportive spouses extended families and hired help, I want to say right this minute that I have tremendous help from my spouse Jim Miller who's sitting right here, thank you Jim. Wave! Wave! He took over everything. Lend a hand of support to others we have achieved what we have because earlier generations of men and women fought hard to make things better so that we all today have more opportunity than just 30 years ago. We must watch for the tendency to feel shame when our colleagues of color make mistakes, we must demonstrate failure or our cues to van that may lead us to try to dissociate from that but I tell you we have to be supportive of each other. Learn to transform gossip about others and to support of healthy commentaries about how we must all provide support for each other when we're lucky and we have opportunity to achieve that opens up new possibilities and sometimes amazing opportunities so remember to reach back and lend a hand to others. It's important to service mentors and role models to others. A lesson learned I would not have won had it not been for my racial ethnic minority colleagues who attended the State Leadership Conference. This is a conference held every year in March at APA where officers of every state Psychological Association come together for leadership training. And umm… Jennifer Kelley developed a diversity delegate so that each state is invited to bring a person from a racial ethnic minority background uh… to get some leadership training as well. Well these folks were encouraged by my sister Jessica Henderson Daniel to go home and have their state psychological uh… territorial association of the or other organizations they were involved in to invite me to come give a talk when I declare that I was running for president. You may not know that name recognition is what allows people to vote for you. There are 137,000 members of APA but 99,000 are eligible to vote, students don't get to vote for president at this point. Umm… About 20 percent of people vote. Uh… So what happens is if they're, you know, if you're umm… somebody like Phil Zimbardo who has a big name they're going to win, you know, somebody like that's going to win. Umm… Another… There are many different strategies and ways to get elected is very, very difficult very, very complex but I ended up providing 40 workshops keynote addresses in 25 different states in the year and a half time. Forty keynote addresses workshops and so on in 25 different states in the year and a half because my brothers and sisters had their organizations for their state Psychological associations invited me. Many allies also helped. I was lucky to have developed expertise in ethics which is a required workshop in many states you require it they will come. Uh… I also did a lot of multicultural competence and ethics and it's true Samuel that these days people are recognizing the mainstream importance of this topic. Umm… Those who are well known for your publications people like Derald Wing Sue and others would not have to do what I did. Derald Wing Sue could decide to run for an APA president and get elected, he should run shouldn't he? Don't you think? He keep saying now others contributed money, testimonials on my website, distributed buttons, made calls and so on the point is that support in many different ways is very important and I shall remember that with humility and appreciation all my life. I also suggest that women and men of color leaders understand their power and use it wisely. I strongly encourage use of that influence to engage in advocacy at that same commencement speech last May to Bernard college which by the way is affiliated with Columbia University. US President Barack Obama encouraged all women graduates to be involved politically. He provided advice he said quote, "Don't just get involved fight for your seat of the table better yet fight for a seat at the head of the table. It's up to you to point out injustice to stand up and to be heard to write to lobby to march to organize to vote. Don't be content to just sit back and watch. Again, the lesson learned one of the challenges is when you're used to giving voice to your constituents needs and you find yourself in a position to look at the whole picture and be responsible for all constituents. The need sometimes can be challenging because there are competing constituency needs at times gets very complicated. For example I was on the board when we have the 2008 budget crisis. Funds were cut too many projects, staff were let go umm… including some projects near and dear to our hearts. We have to know when to be diplomatic and we have to know when to challenge and each of us develops our own styles, each of us develops our own choices about when to do that. You know we saw Obama be sort of a middle of the term, middle of the road trying to compromise kind of a person the first term it's going to be interesting to see how he works for a second term. So there is good news about the role of women and men of color in leadership, there are multiple indices that reflect that women are increasingly changing attitudes and behaviors that may result in attaining positions of leadership as surveyed by the Pew Research Center a few months ago reported that young women today are much more likely than young man to say that having a high paying career profession is a very important aspect of their lives. Two thirds of 18 to 34 year old woman say that being very successful, being successful in the high pain to wear is one of the most important things are very important in their lives. This attitude represents a significant change from just 15 years ago in 1997 when equal numbers of young women and men said Career Success was a high priority. Middle age and older women are also placing more emphasis on career success and they did in 1997. A New York Times article a couple weeks ago reporting the results of a study about boys and girls educational achievement indicated that boys from all racial groups and in all major subject areas received lower grades than their test scores would have predicted, an author indicated that the rise of women doesn't require the fall of men. I believe that this is particularly important for men and women of color. There is a well known gender gap in school grades and achievement and that may be extending elsewhere. At the same time women of all ages continue to value marriage and parenting suggesting that this new emphasis on career has not come at the expense of family. Public attitudes reflect positive views of the changing role of women in society. The Pew Research survey indicates that nearly three quarters of American adults say the trend toward more women in the workforce has been a change for the better, 73 percent say it's been a change for the better. Almost two thirds of adults believe that a marriage and more just spouses both have jobs and both take care of the house and children provides a more satisfying life than one in which the husband provides for the family and the wife takes care of the home. So in the last few decades women have increased educational levels are more highly skilled feel more confident, can compete in a different way than before. Their expectations have risen and they seem to have gotten the empowerment message according to Mundy author of The Richer Sex written about female breadwinners despite multiple barriers women are increasingly attaining positions of leadership. So in conclusion, leadership contributions of women and men of color can lead to positive changes in a variety of settings and opportunities for leadership positions experiences and training can increase the diversity in number and effectiveness of women and men of color as leaders. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor conveyed her believe with judicial authority that a society with umm… can benefit tremendously from having an integrated leadership. The presence of diversity in leadership positions in society is critical and compelling and the research literature on leadership and men is extensive and it's less so for women, especially for women of color. An important goal is thus to increase research on women of color leaders. This includes research on the complexity associated with the intersection of multiple identities that result from identification with more than one salient identity group. Socialization and more than one identity group changes a wide range of psychological processes such as personality, cognition, perception, attributions, social interaction and identity development. And all these aspects of self must be explored as we look at leadership. Those of us who are multicultural have made tremendous strides in acquiring career achievement and leadership in the last three decades, we've done so because of the year by year progress made by people who work very hard in the last century. We all stand on the shoulders of those who have gone before us. Maya Angelou said that a person success is bought and paid for by the people who have gone before them. Many of us have had opportunities because of the literal blood sweat and tears shed by people we may not even know. People took risks and made sacrifices so that unknown and unseen generations behind them would have opportunity. When Keita encourages all us all as we move into leadership to be sure to reach back to lend a hand of support to others with our votes, our development of policy, our advocacy, our assets and influence. My question to you is which contribution will each of you made this year toward that end? I want to think about that. In this Power Point I've listed key uh…references but I also have a full reference list of resources in case you want that we'll figure out how to do that. Thank you very much for your attention.
