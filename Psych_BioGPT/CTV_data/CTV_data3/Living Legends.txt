MARK POPE ACA PRESIDENT, 2003 - 2004 Thank you very much, please be seated. You know there are many reasons that we come to national conventions, but one of the main reasons that I have in many… that I and many of us in our profession come is to see in person the people truly who are famous in our profession. the people who wrote the book that we are using in our theories of counseling class, in our career counseling class, in our couples and family therapy class, in our multicultural counseling class. Who(ph) have contributed to our practice and made us better at our work. I still remember the times as a graduate student and after that I was actually able to see Carl Rogers and B. F. Skinner and Virginia Satir and Fritz Pearls and Carl Jung. Those are memoral… memorable events in my career as a professional counselor and so today we provide you an historic opportunity to see some of our most famous and eloquent legends of our profession. I've asked one of those to introduce and lead our panel today. Jon Carlson is the person who has translated Adler into the language of our profession. He is the founding editor of one of the (inaudible ) journals in family counseling, the family journal. He is a past president of one of our divisions the International Association of Marriage and Family Counseling and he is the producer and star in a series of videotapes that represented the theories of counseling to us in our students in an informative and in an entertaining way. I'm glad to have him on our… in our profession and as my friend please welcome Jon Carlson and our living legends of the American Counseling Association. 

00:03:10
JON CARLSON This is a legends group, we are all getting older, you know. And I was at the nursing home another day working with some people and I noticed at a table there was three men and one woman and they were talking and all of a sudden I heard the woman say, "If you can guess what's in my hand, you can spend the night with me." And the men got this look on their face like, wow and finally they couldn't think of anything, finally one man said, "It's an elephant." And she said, "Close enough." 

00:03:55

00:04:00
JON CARLSON I think we have a lot more experiences like that to look forward to. So, what… what we are going to do today is to give you a chance to get an opportunity to hear from our… our panel as professionals and the personal side. And so we're gonna begin with a question that I pose to each of them that they have one minute, they're guaranteed one minute of fame here today. And it could be less you know, some may have one minute um… that what they say will be remembered by each one of you today, what would you message be? And so we are gonna begin with John Krumboltz and John is a professor at Stanford University, ah… he's been a long time friend of many us, ah… he's published widely in the field of career development and the area of behavioral and cognitive behavioral counseling so without any further I do John. 

00:05:05
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Well, it's an honor to be decleared a living legend, I think it's much preferable than be in the other kind. So what would I like you to remember that takes one minute? Remember, that the goal of counseling is to help your clients learn how to create more satisfying life for themselves in the real world, not just in the counseling sessions. Empower them to realize that luck is no accident and that they can create their own luck by taking appropriate actions in the real world. Sure, it's important to be a warm and genuine empathic listener so clients know you understand their concerns. But that's not enough. You and your clients must collaborate in planning appropriate actions for them to take, to try to… to try out in their real world before the next counseling session. Let me give you a quick example, James came to see me complaining that he hated his job and he wanted me to determine a better occupation for him. "Well, what is your job?" He says, "I won a small business, I'm a refrigerator salesman." "What's wrong with your job?" "I don't know, I just hate the whole thing." He said. I asked, "Are there some parts of your job that you hate more than other parts?" And he says, "Probably so." I said, "How could we discover what parts are the worst and what parts you don't mind quite so much?" And he said, "Well, I could probably keep track of it." And I said, "Great idea. Why don't we set up a way that you can keep a record of what you do on the job and ah… say just one day and ah… and then you could make a radian of each task that you perform? If you really love what you are doing on that task, give it a ten, if you just absolutely hate it give it a zero and if you are sort of so-so about it give it a five and you give other numbers in between there." And he said, "Okay, I can do that." Well, I didn't see him for two weeks. Two weeks later he came in and he'd kept a record not for one day, but for two whole weeks and as(ph) he handed me this… this record and I expected to see a long column of zeros of all the things he hated, ah… but instead I saw some tens many nines and eights, a few fives, but there was no radian less than five. And he said, "You know, I discovered that I do enjoy ah… the part of my job where I help customers figure out how to get the best quality refrigeration equipment for the least long term cost. Ah… I don't care much for the accounting details but I could delegate that part." I expressed my surprise at his high positive radians because he just told me how much he hated this job two weeks earlier. He says, "What I did… what I discovered was that I don't hate what I do, I hate telling people that I'm just a refrigerator salesman." And then he tells me a long story about how his mother expects him to become the ruler of the free world. 

00:08:55
[sil.] 

00:09:00
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ And I… I said, "Why, why don't you give yourself some other title then?" And he said, "Like what?" And I said, "I don't know. But you did say that there were something about the job that you enjoyed very much, why don't you think that over and we'll talk about it next time." Well, he came back one week later and at this time he had a new business card all printed up with his name on it and his new title which was Cold Storage Consultant. And he said to me, he said, "John you are genius \at figuring out what was wrong with me." And I said, "No, no, no you are the genius, because you did all the hard work you discovered what you liked and you created a better job title for yourself." The moral of this story is, help your clients take small action steps in their real worlds that move them gradually closer to the satisfying lives they desire. 

00:10:15
JON CARLSON Our next legend is Dr. William Glasser. Ah… Bill is a psychiatrist, but he's really not a psychiatrist, he sees himself as a counselor. And he calls himself a counselor, he's really been one of us ever since he began, he is a non-prescribing physician. Most of you know his work, ah… he's developed Reality Therapy and Choice Theory and he's like the energizer bunny, he just keeps on going and going and going. Every time he calls me he's got a new idea, a new book and new manuscript and something that he's developing so without any further I do William Glasser. 

00:11:00
WILLIAM GLASSER The… the only thing that's gonna be very new to me today is only having a minute. I'm a… I'm a psychiatrist by profession as he said, I'm a counselor by choice and I'm a legend, because I got good genes from my parents. Ah… psychiatry right now, for quite a while now stands for mental illness drugs and perhaps a lot of money too. I stand for mental health and happiness. I believe that ACA stands for mental health, because I was invited to Washington back in November to talk to Mark Pope and representatives from all the various states of the country, who came to this really mental health conference and I explained mental health to them and I got a wonderful reception I left(ph), there're very much glowing in everything, so I… I believe they support this, you support this very strongly. Now, mental health is… is not easy to come by, but it's not complicated, check yourself out, if you get along well with all the important people in your life you're happy and you are mentally healthy. If you are not, you are not mentally ill, but you are probably less than mental… less mentally healthy than you like to be. I believe counseling because that's all I've ever done can improve your mental health. I've counseled all my life and I've never diagnosed a mental iller who prescribed to psychiatric drug. What I hope for this is my chance to express it, I hope the ACA will work to separate itself from psychiatry and drugs and mental illness and make the thrust of what you do the concept of mental health perhaps that could be a thing for one of your next meetings mental health, because the world really needs to pay attention to that concept, the world has hardly even met that concept all the mental, you know the Mental Health Organization in the world they just push drugs in mental illness. So mental illness needs a friend and I certainly hope the ACA will be that friend. Thank you very much. 

00:13:15

00:13:20
JON CARLSON Thank you Bill. I have the… the… the privilege to introduce Dr. Albert Ellis I won't use any four letters words in my introduction. This is a great time to introduce Ell, because Ell can't hear me and so Ell is having a very difficult time hearing so we are kind of working and passing notes back and forth, I just got so much respect that he would come here under these conditions and share his birthday with us and so let's give Ell you know, a big round of applause. 

00:14:00
[sil.] 

00:14:20
ALBERT ELLIS Thank you. Unfortunately, because of my hearing difficulty I can hear by god damn thing, but it sounds good. 

00:14:30
[sil.] 

00:14:40
ALBERT ELLIS But what I like to be remembered for I'm usually remembered as the pioneer instigator of cognitive behavior therapy, rational therapy. But I like to be remembered most definitely as the one of the main originators of cognitive emotive behavior therapy, because as I said in 1956 when people think they feel and behave and when they behave they think and feel and when they feel they think and behave so consequently one has to face the fact that thinking includes emotional behavior and they will include each other and consequently in my later days I've trained rationally motive behavior therapy, but it's also very philosophic because people have to solidly think things through and come to conclusions by themselves in their experience not merely because something has told them(ph). So therefore, I hope to be remembered as one of the main pushers of USA unconditional self-accept that you always accept yourself. You always accept yourself just because you are that way and accept your faults and your problems and your disturbances, but second we teach people in REBT to you all had(ph) unconditional other acceptance that's other called social interest. You live in a world with people and unless you accept them no matter what they do if you game(ph) them for their doings then they'll do worst and create more terrorism war etc. So you unconditionally accept them just because they're human, fellow humans and finally you unconditionally accept life, ULA with all its goddamn hassles and problems and difficulties, you don't like it you think it's very big in many respects, but you always unconditionally accept this and don't authorize and wind(ph) and scream then it shouldn't be the way it is. Unfortunately, it is the way it is, fuck it. 

00:17:50
[sil.] 

00:17:55
JON CARLSON That there was only one F word that I counted and that could be a record. We're doing this out for (inaudible ) so I get my one minute and unlike Ell, I'm going to answer the question. 

00:18:15
[sil.] 

00:18:20
JON CARLSON I would hope you know that each counselor would realize that we are shrinking as a profession, we've become more and more and more private we hide behind confidentiality, I think we do that to avoid community responsibility. We only work behind closed doors, there's an old Buddha saying that says a frog in the well cannot discuss the ocean, he's limited by the size of his well. Alfred Adler gave us the concept of social interest 100 years ago. The Buddhist called it loving kindness, they have been talking about it for 2500 years. Adler stated that healthy people are those who care about others. And they're active in making the world a better place. I urge that each of you work very hard to become more visible and that you take on the role of what we're calling citizen counselor. And you offer your many talents to your communities to create healthy and more humanistic climates. Focus your work on social interest and focus your love on loving kind, your life on loving kindness. Kind of as a summary of Charles Shorts(ph), who is a good friend of Bill Glasser's, who was gave us a quote. He said, "Life is like a ten speed bike most of us have a lot of gears we have never used. Use your gears." Thank you. 

00:20:00

00:20:05
JON CARLSON Patricia was the past president of the Association of Multicultural Development and as currently on the faculty of Arizona State University and you probably know her as your president elect… elect of the American Counseling Association, so we like to congratulate her… 

00:20:25
[sil.] 

00:20:30
JON CARLSON Turn the microphone over to you. 

00:20:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Thank you Jon [non-English narration] it is really (inaudible ) a great honor to be with this esteemed panel and to be here at this event for an opening session. As I thought about my one minute and what I wanted to say, I… I do want to began with dedicating my presence here to my parents and to my (inaudible ), because they were living legends in my life time and they… they are the individuals who really inspired who I've become and what I've been able to do in my zeal for multiculturalism in the profession. So that's my first statement, ah… my tribute to them. I would say that a statement that I learned growing up relates very much to the message I want to convey to you and that statement was about the (inaudible ) to have desire, ah… to have enthusiasm to want to do something. And as I grew up as an Mexican American in Ohio what I learned is that there were a lot of underrepresented groups in that city. They were immigrants, they were other ethnic minorities, they were people who were poor and it's I suppose no accident that I have dedicated my professional life to focusing on voices of underrepresented people ah… primarily through my involvement in what has become this great multicultural movement in the country and I think nationally and internationally. All of these issues of giving voice are once that I think we as professionals all have the opportunity to do. Ah… we are all leaders in our own right, we can create our own legacy… legacies and legends by how we lead our professional life. As it comes to multiculturalism women's issues, ah… immigrant issues, social justice issues in counseling, I've always found myself aligned with those and I think what I find in that is a sense of… of human dignity and diversity that I… I believe we have to continue to not just say, but we have to continue to put into practice. Ah… I… I also know that we live in a multicultural world in a society that we are all multicultural beings and I, I would hope that the sense of human interconnectedness can be one that ACA continues to embrace promote again not just in theory but in action and that everyone who is here knows that you are part of a larger multicultural family within ACA and nationally. I also know that there are many-many young people here at the conference, ah… a lot of graduate students, a lot of young professionals and I want to say that I hope that our legacy to your will be to be part of this association to make it prosper to make multicultural thinking, multicultural practice prosper. Don't be afraid of multiculturalism, don't be afraid of women's issues, gay issues, ah… social justice issues be part of them. And again in the quote of another famous ah… Mexican American civil rights activist Cesar Chavez, I leave you with the words [non-English narration] "Yes, we can." 

00:24:05
[sil.] 

00:24:15
JON CARLSON Well, now you've had a chance to hear what the panel would like you to take home. Now, let's find out some more about who they are. I pose some questions to them and we're gonna start with just some very general kinds of questions like what is one book that you would hope that all of the counselors in this room would have read? John? 

00:24:40
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Well, let me try to answer that, ah… it just so happens that there are three members of this panel who have books on display at impact publishers over in the exhibit hall, ah… and they are Jon Carlson and Albert Ellis and yes myself. And ah… so it may seem like a little bit of self-interest here to mention this, but ah… I do recommend a book called Luck is no Accident, making the most of happened stance in your life and career. Ah… it's an important book, because it describes the role of happened stance as a way of approaching career concerns and it tells how to create unplanned beneficial events and to take advantage of them and it's a reader friendly book and with lots of practical stories illustrated cartoon… cartoons and helpful exercises and it just so what happens that I'm scheduled for a book signing over at the exhibit hall from 10 o'clock to 11 o'clock this morning ah… at the impact publishers booth in the exhibit hall. And I think Jon is later and I think Albert Ellis was yesterday. So ah… that is a book Luck is no Accident that I highly recommend. 

00:26:05
JON CARLSON Okay, John. Bill? 

00:26:10
WILLIAM GLASSER I don't think it will come as any surprise that I… I recommend the book Choice Theory and as far as I'm concerned mental health is happiness is Choice Theory. It's a triple metaphor and that's the book I recommend. 

00:26:35
ALBERT ELLIS Well, the book I'm gonna recommend is unreadable, but I still advice you to look through at or look through simple versions and it's Alfred Korzybski's book Science and Sanity written in 1933 and he was not a psychologist, he was a philosopher and he thought that when you say anything practically, you are human being and you tend to generalize such as I failed and I might well fail again or I succeeded and I might well succeed again. But the human condition by logically and socially is to over generalize, when I fail I am a failure what he call the ease(ph) of identity and that's false, you can't be as a failure and you can't be a success because a failure would fail all the time and a success which successful individual would fear would be succeeding all the time which is impossible. So you therefore generalize but don't ever over generalize, but since Korzybski is a little unreadable read Hayakawa or the other general semanticists and you'll get some very good therapy that way. 

00:28:20
[sil.] 

00:28:25
JON CARLSON When I look at this question, I have to divide into fiction and non-fiction and when I think of fiction I know which all of you to read a book called Straight Man by Richard Russo. We have informed this delightful book ah… it will… it will un ah… it will help you look at life very-very differently it's a gentlemen Reflex(ph) is a professor in a very bizarre department, probably a lot like the institutions that we all working. And I think on the other side I… ah… there is a very touching book that we need to be upon it's by the Dalai Lama and Daniel Goleman called destructive emotions and it goes through some of the most recent research that neuroscientists have presented but it also brings forward 2500 years of… of experience and the Buddhist in this particular study have learned how to live happily. I think that's a pretty good thing, would you think so Bill, you know Bill… 

00:29:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Oh, yeah I met the Buddhist down the road and he taught me Choice Theory. 

00:29:35
JON CARLSON I think I walked into that. 

00:29:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Well, when I think of books that I would recommend some of them are academic, ah… but the there're three books that automatically came to mind the first was written in 1976 when I realized that there was a women's voice out there who knew what I was thinking about and that's the books Toward a New Psychology of Women 1976 Jean Baker Miller, I still think it's a classic as far as women psychology and psychology is concerned and it's a small paper back so Toward a New Psychology of Women Jean Baker Miller. Ah… another book that I recommend is by Diane Dreher, D-R-E-H-E-R, it's called the Tao of Leadership, and Tao is in Daoism and I think there are so many messages in that book to inspire us and to remind us about the opportunities to be leaders in everyday life and there is the term in the book called (inaudible ) and it's… it means flowing with change and I think our lives as counselor ah… as professional counselors mean(ph) flowing with change. And the… the final book and I read a lot of books outside of counseling to be honest with you to inspire me and to give me new thinking and new ideas and this book is by Don Miguel Ruiz may be many of your have read the books of Don Miguel Ruiz ah… and these are… these are four principles for living and he has two other compendium books and those are all ones that I would recommend that would really fortify us and also expand our thinking as professional counselors. 

00:31:25
WILLIAM GLASSER If you want a fiction book that to me describes the mentally healthiest character I never met it's in the Cider House Rules by John Irving. 

00:31:35
JON CARLSON Good, yeah thank you Bill. Now, what I'd like to… to pose to the panel again you know, if you weren't really a living legend, what was plan B, I mean what… what would you have been if you weren't a living legend, why don't we start with you, Patricia? 

00:31:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Well, I suppose I… I have to go back to what my scripted role was as a woman and that scripted role was I… I might have gone to college or I might not have, I might have stayed in my hometown and become you know gotten married and had a bunch of children um… or I would have gone to college and just finished my undergraduate degree return home and let lived at home because I wasn't married and been a teacher at the high school in Lorain, Ohio. And I think that critical decision at that point to not go home to Lorain, Ohio and to live under my parent's roof was a demarcation in my personal and professional life because I upset the pattern for women and upset the pattern for women in my family and I think women of my generation I have to say. 

00:32:45
JON CARLSON Well, for me heredity ruled out professional basket ball, jazz, piano player and other things I believe I would be what my original first degree was would be a fifth grade teacher, you know to work in an elementary school with children all day long because that's where energy comes from for me. 

00:33:10
ALBERT ELLIS Well I love music and I also like and love writing song lyrics and if I had the time for it I would probably be a composer of sensible songs. Because… because most songs have become popular are crap of the worst all(ph). There… therefore I would compose the music if I had some musical training, but I definitely would compose the lyrics to sensible rational songs that people could think, right. 

00:34:05
[sil.] 

00:34:10
ALBERT ELLIS Would I give a song? Yes. Yes, if I could remember it but fortunately… 

00:34:25
[sil.] 

00:34:35
ALBERT ELLIS Let me sing love me, love me only me to the tune of the Yankee Doodle. Love me, love me, only me or I'll die without you! Make your love a guarantee, so I can never doubt you! Love me, love me totally really, really try dear, but if you demand love, too, I'll hate you till I die, dear! 

00:35:10
[sil.] 

00:35:20
ALBERT ELLIS Sec… sec… second stanza. Love me, love me, love me all the time, quite thoroughly and wholly! My life turns into slushy shine less you love me solely! Love me with great tenderness, with no ifs or buts dear. If you love me somewhat less, I'll hate your goddamned guts, dear! 

00:35:50
[sil.] 

00:35:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, it's I know that's a tough one to follow. If I were had another profession I would be a playwright, at least a professional one, I'm an amateur playwright now, I've written Curley(ph) and I wrote together our second play and if you come to Chicago for our convention in July you will be have a Saturday night dinner theater and you will be able to enjoy the world premiere of our latest play it's called The Other Woman. 

00:36:30
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Well, ah… for me play A was never to become living legend I mean, I never thought that would ever I never even consider that as plan A and so I've never had a plan B. Ah… although I have thought about various things in various time in my life ah… for example for a while I thought I wanted to be a professional baseball player and ah… then at age 13 I changed my mind and the reason was ah… because I came up to bat against a… you know I was 13 I came up to bat against a pitcher who was 16 years old, his name was Lefty and he later pitched for the Cleveland Indians but at that moment he was pitching to me and he threw his first pitch and it came straight at my head and I ducted into the dirt and looked up just in time to see the ball curve around over the center of the play for a call strike and I realized at that moment that my career plans had changed. 

00:37:40
[sil.] 

00:37:50
JON CARLSON Excuse me, ah… what I would like to have the panel address of all the things that they do in their free time, what do they like to do the most and what that have been the same answer 25 years ago. John, can you start with you. 

00:38:05
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Well, I love to play tennis and 25 years ago I would have given you the same answer. 

00:38:15
JON CARLSON Okay, Bill. 

00:38:15
WILLIAM GLASSER I love to play tennis too and it would have been the same answer and I'm getting steadily worse at it. 

00:38:25
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ I have been steadily better Bill. 

00:38:30
ALBERT ELLIS What I would like to do the most is the thing I have been doing recently even though I've been recovering from a serious intestinal operation and that is write books and in the last six months or so I've written my new books and I've done that 25 years ago and I intent to keep it up forever. 

00:38:55
[sil.] 

00:39:05
JON CARLSON For me it was exercise you know, in 25 years ago I was a competitive runner and would run you know 100 miles a week, now I feel really good about being able to walk, because I worn my knees out, but that would be my answer. 

00:39:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO I probably have to say my what I love to do in my spare time in all, you know I do love people so I do spend time with people but additional ah… and I would… I was doing this 25 years ago I was playing golf and that's sort of my very-very favorite sports athlete is playing golf, and was followed by yoga. 

00:39:40
JON CARLSON Okay, this should be brief if you could make this answer brief what does the future of counseling whole I mean, we're barely 100 years old as a profession, do you see us be in here in year 200. Patricia. 

00:39:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO I definitely see counseling been around in 200 years or… or has for… for the very simple reason that I think ah… Dr. Glasser mentioned if we focus on mental health, mental wellbeing ah… that I think the profession of counseling has much to offer in the future and that's not just here in the domestic United States but with our international relations I think everyone is interested in mental wellbeing, good health and I think we are going to be able to leverage that because of our multicultural focus or focus on inclusiveness and I think the vast richness of… of theories that we have available to us. 

00:40:50
JON CARLSON Yeah, you know for me the challenge is to resist the sickness disease model, it's so attractive to be junior shrinks and it's very important that we be aware of what we bring to the mental health table that's the focus on development, the focus on health, the focus on wellness and we echoing Patricia's words need to focus on mental health and not mental illness. 

00:41:15
ALBERT ELLIS I think that counseling will pretty much go along the way it is now and become more and more popular, but I think it will also take on a much more psycho educational approach. So the counselors will do prophylactic work in addition to therapeutic work, they've faced the fact and help people face the fact that all humans are out of their fucking mind… because they're human they all have very serious problems and any form of therapy it says that they are just nice people without problems henceforth. So I think counseling will face the fact that all the children and adults will grow up with the surfaces(ph) that they better honestly face this and we the counselors better teach as well as therapize(ph) and show them how to cope with their own problems by themselves with other people and with good counseling. 

00:42:35
WILLIAM GLASSER I… I can't really add anything to that I just to, I'm just gonna follow Alan(ph) I planned to live in to all the next 100 years and come in on and I'll tell you then. 

00:42:50
JOHN KRUMBOLTZ Well, I… I think that we ought to be trained to make ourselves extinct by teaching everyone in the world counseling skills. So that we wouldn't need to have to give counseling to other people we… everyone in the world would be treating each other as a counselor treats a fellow counselor. So, ah… in that sense I think we ought to be trying to become extinct but ah… I just picked up a copy of the futurist magazine recently that had a list of 28 occupations that they expected to be very prominent in the future and that 7 of the 28 were counseling occupations. Ah… some of them were once… some of them I'd never heard about for example a horticultural counselor, ah… let's say someone who uses gardening as a mechanism for helping people ah… maximize their satisfaction with life, ah… another one was a retirement counselor, another was a leisure counselor. Ah… but I thought it was very interesting that that the futurist at least see the counseling profession is very prominent ah… in the next 100 years. 

00:44:10
JON CARLSON Ah… what I would like to do is to we're gonna close right now by passing the microphone back to Dr. Mark Pope and while he's coming up to there… there is a story that I picked up that was of the wire(ph) service there was an elderly Floridian had called 911 and… and sound(ph) her cell phone to report that her car had been stolen. It had been broken into and she was just hysterical. She explained her situation to the dispatcher that the stolen the stereo, they've stolen the steering wheel, the brake pedal and even the accelerator. The dispatcher said, "Just stay calm, an officer is on the way." And a few minutes later the officer called back and said, "Disregard, she got into the back seat."
