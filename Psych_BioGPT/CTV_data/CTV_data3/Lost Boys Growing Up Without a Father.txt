PETER DOWNIE A romantic dream of sailing in a tall ships race, took Ian Brims off to sea. But north of Bermuda, a storm took his life when the ship he was on was lost. He left behind the family in Toronto that included twin sons. 

00:00:40
UNKNOWN I thought, why? Why couldn't somebody else's? Why did this happen to us? You know, this isn't fair. We've been robbed of our future with our father, and now we have to grow up without him. 

00:00:55
UNKNOWN When you're a small child, everything your father does is, is, is everything to you and it's the best thing. And after, after the age, age of 11, we didn't have a father. 

00:01:10
UNKNOWN What really upset me most, but, but made me realize just how much they were hurting was one day, they said, uh, "I wish you'd died instead of daddy." I said, "That's not a very nice thing to say." "Yes, but he could mend bicycles, and you can't."

PETER DOWNIE What is it that happens in families when sons have to grow up without their fathers? Hello, I'm Peter Downing. Some sons lose their fathers through death. Some fathers abandon their sons after a divorce, but surely the most troubling and confusing situation is when a father is physically there, but is emotionally absent. Tonight on Man Alive we're going to explore what one man has called, the hole left in men's souls by the absent father. Now whether or not you think you have that hole, I'm pretty sure what you're about to hear is going to trigger some memories, and it will leave you reconsidering your own life, or as a father.

PETER DOWNIE Their father's body was never recovered, but the Brims family still put a memorial plaque. It was somewhere his sons came often, and it was really all they had to believe that in someway, their father was still with them. 

00:02:50
[sil.] 

00:02:50
UNKNOWN We had something to talk to, something to relate to, and there was actually something that we could see, and his name was on it. And, and I think that was very important to us. All we really have is our memories, and the fondest memories I have is, is, is sailing, which is my father's passion. There's always a lot of wish I had said this, and wish I had done this. And that's one of the things that I have problems with, with coping is that I wish I had gone and given him a hug, and told him I loved him before he left. Simply, I waved and said, "We'll see you in two weeks." And that's the last memory I have of my father. You watch TV a lot as a young child. You're watching cartoons. You're watching TV shows, and you see that great, dominant father figure, you know, in a commercial perhaps. A father's taken the kid to hockey, and they're laughing, and they're having fun, and, you needed, you needed that support. You needed to do these things with your father, and that, that's a, uh, a dream that I think all children have, and they fantasize about. I don't think anybody ever gets over the loss of a father. 

00:04:00
[music] 

00:04:00
PETER DOWNIE Looking back, many men find only emptiness where a father could have been. 

00:04:05
PATRICK LANE What I wanted was to go back and be a child again. And grab a hold of this man and put him in my arms, and say, "You know, you're my father, you know. Love me." His body next to mine, both of us, still alive, and not falling. Not falling. 

00:04:25
PETER DOWNIE Patrick Lane is a poet who teaches creative writing at the University of Victoria. 

00:04:30
PATRICK LANE Now that's a poem about my father who was murdered in 1968. And he fell quite a distance after he was shot, and so that's how that detail climbs into the poem. It's a subject that I couldn't write about for many, many years, because I didn't know how to approach it. Whenever I approached it, I approached this subject hysterically. 

00:04:50
PETER DOWNIE Lane's father was shot dead one day at work in a random killing. But even when he was alive, he'd not had much time for fathering. Like many of his generation, he'd gone off to war when his children were small, and he'd been away for four years. 

00:05:05
PATRICK LANE This stranger appeared out of nowhere. And it was, it was a stranger. 

00:05:10
PETER DOWNIE So, did you instantly resent him? Do you think of it? (crosstalk) I don't know if you were... 

00:05:10
PATRICK LANE (crosstalk) It wasn't resentment. I never resented him. It was bewilderment. I mean, I kept thinking, if this is my father, and everybody tells me about fathers, and this is how you're supposed to behave with fathers, I would try to behave with him. But I mean, he didn't, the thing was that he didn't know how to behave, either. I mean, he'd come back from the war, and here were these three boys leftover from the 1930's. And he didn't know what to do with us either. I remember my mother saying, "Take this boy with you on a business trip." He was going up to see some sawmill, and I rode with my father for a whole day up to this sawmill, and all the way back. We never said a goddamn word. And I was so pleased to be with him, you know. So thrilled to be with him. And it was like, he did not know what to do with me, and I knew that he didn't know what to do with me, which made it even more painful. 

00:05:55
PETER DOWNIE But is that better than nothing at all? 

00:06:00
PATRICK LANE No, it's not better. It's worse than nothing at all. It's the worst possible thing imaginable. I mean, I don't remember having a single conversation with my father. 

00:06:05
PETER DOWNIE Not one? 

00:06:10
PATRICK LANE Not one. I mean, like a conversation like where your father would say, "How are you doing today?" You know? "How was school?" I don't remember that ever happening. I mean, my father was a wonderful man, a good provider. You know, led an exemplary life. Was honored by his town, by his townsfolk, and by his peers, and his friends, and things like that. He was a good man, but my two brothers and I, literally, didn't know who he was. I mean, not a conversation. I remember my father, I mean, the things I remember my father saying was, uh, "You know, don't you know how to hammer?" Um, "Stop that." Uh, um, "Here's your allowance." That would be it. Here's the keys to the car when you're 16. And that would be as much of a conversation I'd have with him. 

00:06:55
PETER DOWNIE Cut off emotionally by his father, at an early age Patrick Lane built a wall around his emotions. 

00:07:00
PATRICK LANE Nothing could touch me. Nothing could hurt me. Nobody could do anything to me. You could have cut my arms off, and I would have just smiled at ya. 'Cuz nothing could touch me. 'Cuz no one was gonna hurt me again. Like I had been hurt by my father. 

00:07:20
[sil.] 

00:07:20
PETER DOWNIE The lack of a real emotional connection between a father and son, casts a dark shadow on a boy's life. That belief is at the heart of the writing of John Lee. His first bestselling book, The Flying Boy, explored the pain caused by the absent father. 

00:07:40
[music] 

00:07:40
PETER DOWNIE The book was autobiographical, laying out Lee's troubled memories growing up as the son of an alcoholic father. 

00:07:45
JOHN LEE Uh, dad was not there, and that leaves a hole in a man's soul, and as one, uh, German psychologist, um, said, "Where the father is absent, a hole is created. And in that hole demons rush in." And I read that years ago, and I though, I had several demons rush into that hole, myself. 

00:08:10
PETER DOWNIE I guess losing a father through death, losing him physically, or through a divorce even is one thing, but to lose a father emotionally or spiritually, must be really tough to deal with. 

00:08:20
JOHN LEE In many ways it is, because you can always, you have to always say, sit back and say, "My dad was in my home." You know, I saw him a few nights a week, you know. And he was there. And he didn't show up for my recital. He didn't show up for my graduation. He didn't show up for my football practice. You know, or, uh, when he did he was, you know, drunk or, or, or overly critical of my performance, or whatever. So, that's a piece of it, but like, uh, someone who's father died, or, or left, or maybe was adopted, you know, and doesn't know his real father. Uh, we who had fathers in the home, share the same phenomenon of not knowing who our father is. 

00:09:10
PETER DOWNIE Chris Kaplan grew up confused about fathers. His natural father left home, and then he had two stepfathers in succession. But they didn't feel like real fathers. 

00:09:20
CHRIS KAPLAN I guess the only father that I had was my grandfather, and that was during the summer times. But when summers were over, so was that relationship. It, it made me sad. It, it made me confused. Um, you know, how old was I? 12 years, 11. 11 years old. 12 years old. 13. Um, without a clue of, of, uh, what really being a part of, uh, a family was. I started to create a world, um, you know, I had to tell lies about who my father was. What kind of job he had. What kind of role he played in my life. 

00:10:05
PETER DOWNIE Then, Chris found something that kept reality at bay better than dreams. 

00:10:10
CHRIS KAPLAN One Friday night, everyone was invited to my friend Keith's house, and, um, you know, I got trashed. I got drunk and I got high in the same night. And, uh, I had no problem relating to people. I had no problem talking to, um, who-, whomever I wanted to. And, um, I, I, everything that mattered up until that point, didn't matter anymore. Every bad thing that was going on inside my mind, um, stopped. And, uh, I felt like everyone else. And, uh, I searched for that continually. And, uh, it had some, it had some profound effects. Some, some negative effects on, on, on my life. I, uh, I missed a lot of school as a result of, uh, you know, rather stay home and get high. Or stay home and drink. Um, after school was done, it got me in some criminal prob-, you know, I had some problems with the law. And, um, it put me in jail a few times. Um, it, it ruined my life. 

00:11:15
[sil.] 

00:11:15
PETER DOWNIE The loneliness finally ended for Chris at the age of 20. He had just got out of jail, and was in an addiction treatment center. And then his father came from Toronto for his first visit with his son in 18 years. 

00:11:30
[sil.] 

00:11:30
CHRIS KAPLAN He expressed a lot of guilt for not being there, and um, I just had a desire to have him a part of my life. And nothing really mattered. Nothing was gonna stop that from happening. And, um, all the oth-, all the excuses that each of us had probably used up until that point, um, weren't gonna work anymore, at this point in time. And, um, since then, we've grown really close. Um, I've spent some time, and he's come down here, and we've traveled on trips together. And, uh, it's, it's, it's, it's finally really nice to have, uh, have him a part of my life. 

00:12:15
PETER DOWNIE Any father would do for the young Patrick Lane. 

00:12:15
PATRICK LANE I spent my young life looking for fathers. So I'd adopted families everywhere. I mean, I, eat-, give me a family, I'd adopt them. You know, any old family would do. I'd move in with them. My childhood is spent, half my time was spent away from home living with other kids, and their families pretending I'm one of their kids. (coughs) Because really, all I wanted was a family. I wanted a family. I mean, I spent my early life reading Swiss Family Robinson, that saccharinely sweet sick tale of a happy little Swiss family that goes off and lives on an island somewhere. And they have a happy mom and dad, and they have happy children. And they build beautiful log cabins, and everything's beautiful. It's like, back to Eden. Right? Why did I read this book 19 times between the age of about eight and about 12? 

00:13:00
PETER DOWNIE But why did you keep looking? 

00:13:00
PATRICK LANE Because it was necessary that a father be there. Some father, somewhere. 

00:13:15
[sil.] 

00:13:15
PETER DOWNIE There are only a few memories of times spent with his own father. But after his father's murder, Lane forced himself in his poetry, to look with honesty at the relationship. One intense poem describes a terrible beating the young Patrick deliberately brought on himself. 

00:13:30
PATRICK LANE My father rarely laid a hand on me. It's just that I'd threaten the whole family by bringing down a wheat field. Right? This was gonna cost my father, like, $700 in 1951. 

00:13:40
PETER DOWNIE Yeah. 

00:13:40
PATRICK LANE I mean, you know, $700 then was like, you know, the average sort of family having to come up with $25,000 out of the, out of the kitty. Right? There was nothing in the kitty. And he just looked at me and he said, you know, "I'll kill the son of a bitch. I'll kill the kid." You know. "What's the matter with him? Doesn't he know?" And all I wanted was attention. 

00:13:55
PETER DOWNIE But it's, but you've written that the beating was at least being with your father. 

00:14:05
PATRICK LANE Yeah, the line is, it was as if to be broken was to be loved. You know, here's this man beating his son. Right? With, uh, with a basically, you know, a limb off of a tree. He was really beaten on me. And, uh, you know, and I couldn't, I didn't want him to stop. That was the closest my father and I ever were. It was wonderful. I mean, it was really wonderful. I mean, because I had this man's total attention. He was, he was looking right at me when he was involved there. And that was the closest we ever got. 

00:14:35
PETER DOWNIE A boy grows up wanting approval, companionship, and love, but that's not what John Lee found. 

00:14:40
JOHN LEE It's kind of, uh, uh, a weird situation. Um, mama when's daddy coming home. When is daddy coming home? Well, he'll be home maybe this weekend. And then, six hours after he's there, it's when is he going away? When, when, when will he leave again? Because this is crazy. He's yelling. He's stomping around, and he's, he's just not available to me. He's tired. He's drinking. He's, uh, in the garage working on the car, whatever. 

00:15:05
PETER DOWNIE But that's really the language of an adult, and I, uh, I wonder if you remember how you felt as a kid when that was going on? 

00:15:15
JOHN LEE I remember what happened. One is, is that I would go away. We lived for a part of the time, on a farm, and I would go outside, and be alone. Uh, and then the other was, is that I would look to my mother too much for everything. Which then led me, as an adult, to always look to women for everything, because that's what I had to do as a child. 

00:15:40
PETER DOWNIE But that must have an impact on how you relate with your mother, because he's absent for her, too. 

00:15:45
JOHN LEE Absolutely. See, when dad leaves the home, then two things are gonna happen. Ma, very often, mother is gonna compensate for his absence, which comes to down to meaning that mo-, mom is going to try and make up for his departure, and make your life in such a way that really she can't do. She just doesn't have the ability to be father. She has the ability to be a loving, kind, nurturing mother. But she can't be father to a boy. Especially around adolescence, puberty. But the other component, that, that I just recently started writing about, is that not only is hse going to compensate for the absence of the father, she's going to expect compensation for his absence. And she's going to expect that usually, from the male children in the family. 

00:16:40
PETER DOWNIE That happened to you. I mean, (crosstalk) that's a specific case for you. 

00:16:45
JOHN LEE (crosstalk) Absolutely. It absolutely, it happened, it's happened to millions of men. The child is supposed to be a receptor. It's like, mommy, I need you to hold me. But the mother who says, come and give me a hug. Uh, daddy's gone, and I'm so lonely. Well, it does a kind of damage that, you know, it would take months to talk about. But it, but it does happen. 

00:17:10
PETER DOWNIE But when you are eight, or nine or 10, and you have an absent father, do you end up spending the rest of your life looking for a substitute? Looking for another father? 

00:17:15
JOHN LEE Everywhere you go. 

00:17:25
[sil.] 

00:17:25
PETER DOWNIE Alone in a school computer room, 15 year old Brett Murden is finishing an assignment. He's used to being alone. After his parent's divorce, his father didn't keep in touch. 

00:17:35
BRETT MURDEN It's, it's been so long without even know who he is, uh, it's just like, you know, I don't really care. Like, uh, if he wanted to see me, he would have done it by now. 

00:17:45
PETER DOWNIE Brett lives with his mother, the second youngest of her five children. He grew up with no idea what it was like to have a father in the house. And when he reached his teens, his mother worried that, that might have something to do with his problems. 

00:18:00
UNKNOWN He, uh, seemed to know that, know that he was lacking something. I don't think he had any idea what it was. I think he needed a male influence in his life, and at that point, there wasn't one. He, um, I felt he was suicidal. He was seeing a specialist. He was on different medications. Ic couldn't get Brett to go to school. Um, he really had no self worth. He felt very stupid. Um, he knew that his family cared about him, but as far as anyone else, he was, he was really unsure of himself. 

00:18:35
PETER DOWNIE Now, once every two weeks, Brett has a big brother just to hang out with. Having the company of Kenneth Kerr has made a real difference. 

00:18:50
KENNETH KERR The main thing is that we have a friendship, and we're free, we feel free to discuss the things that are important, too. As and when they need to be discussed. As well as sometimes we'll just, you know, goof off for want of a better term. 

00:19:05
BRETT MURDEN Uh, I wanna go golfing, mini golfing. 'Cuz I like that. It's fun. It's one of my, it's not really a sport, but it's one of my favorite sports. 

00:19:10
UNKNOWN I know there's a lot of people that aren't gonna like it, but I think every boy needs a man in his life. And if it can't be the father, then it's gotta be a substitute. Brett has older brothers, but it's not the same thing as having a man. And Kenneth has been that man. 

00:19:30
BRETT MURDEN I used to be really shy and all that, and now, I'm open. I'm really open. I can talk to pretty well anyone. 

00:19:35
PETER DOWNIE When you hear a young say a teenager talking about how, without a father, saying that he misses the role model. What are they really saying then? 

00:19:45
JOHN LEE I think what they're saying to a large degree is, is that they're mis-, missing masculine energy in the home, and in the life. Um, they're missing a subtle teaching that is communicated by, uh, very often subtle interaction, uh, that happens between, you know, men and their sons. Uh, you know, we can watch television and see how we're supposed to go to work, or we can go to school and listen to a teacher tell us, uh, how we're supposed to be productive members of society. But we can't go to a teacher, and have them show us how to be a man. 

00:20:30
PETER DOWNIE But what can a man teach a boy beyond the obvious practical stuff? Is there something deeper to be found in male solidarity, away from the company of women? 

00:20:40
JOHN LEE What we learned how to do, uh, was how to do manly things, repair a car, pay bills. 

00:20:50
PETER DOWNIE Drink. 

00:20:50
JOHN LEE Drink. Uh, play rugby or football, but we didn't learn what it meant to be a man, because there was no fathers around, or no elders in the community of men to teach us. They're gone. They're scattered. They're gone, they've gone to work. They've gone into alcohol, or whatever, and they're not around. 

00:21:10
PETER DOWNIE But even when the men are around, what do they reveal of themselves? 

00:21:15
JOHN LEE I'm 41 and I still don't know who my father is. Not really. I mean, what does he really believe? What does he really dream? What does he, what did he really wanna be? I don't have any answers to that, and, and I lived with him for 18 years. 

00:21:30
PETER DOWNIE Why is it important for a child, for a son to know that? 

00:21:35
JOHN LEE It will define who he is later. It'll define his sense of masculinity, and what it means to be a man. But I'm real sad to say what really happens is, is whatever is in the darker, in the shadows about dad, is pretty much gonna be in the shadows about your own life, too. Um, if, if dad doesn't tell you, and, and, and explain to you and share with you the difficulties in being a man, the pains, the joys, the agonies, uh, if he doesn't share with you his dreams, and hopes. Then when you get to be a man, you won't share 'em with anybody either, and you'll just lock 'em all up inside. Shutdown like dad did, and then your kids will end up going, I don't know my dad either. 

00:22:25
[music] 

00:22:25
PETER DOWNIE And that cycle, maybe the greatest tragedy of the missing father. 

00:22:30
PATRICK LANE You're talking about a man who came out of the prairie. Cagen [SP] prairie in the 19, uh, you know, born in 1910, 20's. Left home when he was 13, 14 years old. His father, you know, threw him out. He was on the road when he was 13 years old. I mean, he didn't know how to be a father. He didn't know what fatherhood was. And I learned really well from him, what fatherhood was. I mean, I learned from him. He taught me. So guess what kind of a father I was. The shits. I was an awful father. I was a terrible father. I mean, I didn't abuse my children, or do anything like that, I just didn't know, I didn't know what to do with them. I didn't know what fatherhood meant. So I just left them. I got married when I was 17. I was a kid. I didn't know what it was to be a man. I invented my manhood, and did a bad job of it. Screwed up marriages. Screwed up women. Screwed up children. I mean, I learned my, I learned manhood from the movies. You know, I learned it from what? Tom Micks [SP]? You know, leading through to John Wayne. And then transforming itself into the, you know, the, the loser hero, you know. 

00:23:30
PETER DOWNIE Do you think the expectations that your sons have of you as a father, are different from the ones you had of your dad? 

00:23:40
PATRICK LANE No, my sons have turn-, you know, they get very angry at me. You know, because their wounds are very deep, and they go way, way back to the break up of marriages, and the collapse of families. And so, they have real problems with that, and I just say, "Look, I'm here when you want me. You know, I'll be here. I mean, I can't be the father, the old father you think you lost." But I said, "I'm still here. You know, and when you're ready, you come to me anytime you want. I'll, I'll talk to you." 

00:24:05
PETER DOWNIE If you could be at your dad's death bed, would you say anything? Would you wanna say something to him? 

00:24:10
JOHN LEE Well, luckily for me, and this is not the case for most men, luckily for me, uh, prior to writing my first book, I said everything to him I needed to say. I knew that I did not wanna find myself at a death bed, or at the grave site, wishing that I had said anything. So... 

00:24:30
PETER DOWNIE That's unusual, I think. 

00:24:35
JOHN LEE It's very unusual. But, but I, but what I said during those hours, of saying was, "I hate you. I love you. I needed you. I despise you. Uh, I'm angry at you. I'm so-, I, um, I'm so sad that I never had you. Uh, your alcoholism hurt me. Your whippings hurt me. Your absence hurt me. And I still loved you. And I still love you. And I need you to know that. And, and, and, uh, I'm scared. And I'm lonely sometimes. And, and, uh, I hated the way you treated my mother." And I said all that. Man to man. 

00:25:15
PETER DOWNIE Patrick Lane didn't have the chance to have those final heartfelt words with his father. But he tried to say what he felt in his poems. 

00:25:25
PATRICK LANE I said, "Who were you?" And I was angry, you know, really angry at this man. And what came out was just love. And said, "I'll lift you out of the ground, and I'll hold you in my arms, and I'll love you in spite of yourself. In spite of what you've, what you didn't give me, I will, I will demand you give me love. You have to give me love. That's your responsibility." And that, I think, is what fatherhood is all about. You've gotta give it to them anyway. Whether they want it or not.
