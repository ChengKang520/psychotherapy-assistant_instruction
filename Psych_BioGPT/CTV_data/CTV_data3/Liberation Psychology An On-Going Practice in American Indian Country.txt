JOSEPH  Good morning. Introductions often ah, fail to capture the powers of speakers and my introduction of today's speakers no different. It is my deep honor to introduce to you this morning's keynote speaker, Dr. Eduardo Duran. Dr. Duran is a graduate of California School of Professional Psychology, and since graduating, he spent the last over 20 years of his entire professional career working in Indian country. Currently, he is working to resurrect Indian culture and in particular ah, the revitalization of two native languages with the Niwok and Midonesians(ph). And I was speaking with him yesterday, he's mentioned to me that they are, during the resurrection of these two languages with no native speakers and only through taped conversations, and so it is just an immense incredible undertaking that they're, that they're ah, endeavoring to accomplish. He's a scholar and a practitioner. He has numerous publications, three ah, the author of three books, Native American Postcolonial Psychology, Buddha and Redface, and his latest book Healing the Soul Wound, which people have described it as the most innovative and thought-provoking scholarship that they've read in a long time and ah, repres, and, it will represent a paradigm shift and others have called it powerful and inspiring. Dr. Duran currently is the director of Health and Wellness for the United Auburn Indian Community. So let's please welcome Dr. Eduardo Duran.

DR. EDUARDO DURAN  Good morning. Ah, I know that ah, fire is prohibited but ah, just a tiny little bit of smoke ah, ah, is usually appropriate. The reason I've done what I was able to do ah, this far in my ah, life and career is because ah, it's a, a lot easier to get ah, forgiveness than permission, so. 

00:03:20

00:03:20
DR. EDUARDO DURAN  And that was really something. I mean, brother Joseph can ah, can really wail, huh, you know. I thought he was just a psychologist. And he, he, he actually has talent (laughs) and, and ah, and ah, some of us ah, few of the things are gonna be repeated ah, 'coz some of you heard them yesterday but ah, it's important, ah, that the conference is ah, on identity, and ah, identity is a, is a real important thing for, for all things, for all human beings. And ah, (coughs) it's really important that, that you know a little bit of ah, who I am and, and my ah, given name is ah, is Eduardo Duran and ah, my ah, spirit, I also have ah, ah, a spiritual name which ah, only recently do I have been able to divulge in ah, audiences ah, such as this 'coz it's usually a ceremonial name. And like I said yesterday ah, this, this is a ceremony, and all the work that we do is ceremony and ah, that's part of the ah, the latest ah, writings that I've been doing is to let the people in our field know that everything we do is, is sacred and ah, part of a ceremonial context. And whichever way you believe, it's all, and ah, when ah, my brother said that I've done all of my work ah, in Indian country, I was thinking, "Well, so have you" because all of this is Indian country.

00:04:55
DR. EDUARDO DURAN  And ah, I, I had a sister here yesterday who gave me permission to speak ah, because, ah, when we go into someone else's area ah, ah, not that they were territorial but it's good manners, especially if we're gonna talk about ah, healing and sacred things, it's good to have permission and, and she's a psychologist and she's from a local area and she came and said it's okay if you talk. And ah, and so I feel ah, uhm, that it's okay to do that. And my ah, spiritual name is [non-English narration] ah, which translates into ah, healer at the camp, and, uhm, I'm from ah, the Apache Tewa and in through the adoption in Hunka way(ph). I'm also Lakota and on my mother side, I'm ah, I'm Italian and ah, and so I take privilege in ah, speaking for all people from both sides of the ocean because I carry ah, ah, those particular ah, DNA strands, ah, in me. And ah, I was really impressed yesterday with ah, all the talks that ah, that my sisters ah, gave in the morning and, and I was like "Man! They're really, really smart" and, (laughs) ah, and ah, and it's really ah, a little bit intimidating because like I was saying ah, telling ah, I saw my relatives here. Most of the talks that I do, I do in Indian country ah, with Indian community and it's not uncommon to, to have ah, ah, a whole day discussion with as many people as sitting here which becomes ah, like a community group healing ah, session. And, and ah, and so it's a little bit intimidating talking to ah, everyone in here who is ah, psychologist and ah, done a lot of research. And ah, I told people I, I don't do research. I'm just still searching, and so it goes, if you're researching, that means and it implied that you already found something and ah, I still haven't found anything, and so. (laughing) Ah, I wanna start ah, with, uhm, ah, a teaching from ah, the Tibetan Book of the Dead ah, different one than yesterday. And, and ah, the reason I do this is so that, uhm, we can overcome our fear of ah, of whatever it is that we're doing ah, in our work, in our life. And is ah, (inaudible ) the, the holy man, who ah, is, is credited with writing the Tibetan Book of the Dead. So from the eastern quarter of your brain, White Gauri(ph), goddess, will appear to you holding a corpse as a club in her right hand and a skull cup filled with blood in her left hand, do not be afraid. And so if you can, ah, go with that image, then, then the rest is pretty easy. And, uhm, I wanna talk a little bit about ah, what got me to this place, kind of ah, ah, an evolution of ah, of the work transpired. And then I'm gonna give you a few snippets of ah, conversations ah, that I've had ah, kinda composites over the years and some of the ah, things that I tell people that come to me for ah, for therapy, for healing. And, 'coz over the years ah, I, I had written some pretty dry theoretical stuff. And when I go ah, into any community, they say, "We really like the stuff you wrote but what is it you do?" And, and so ah, just kind of intuitive stuff and ah, it wasn't until ah, ah, brother Allen Ivey came to the Santa Fe Indian Hospital and I remember ah, people said, "Dr. Ivey is here to see you" and, and I'm like "See me?" I mean, that's like God coming to see you, you know? (laughs) It's like, and sure enough, there he was with his wife Mary and ah, in our humble little ah, hospital place there. And ah, and then I remember he said to me ah, ah, 'coz you know I was running around doing hospital stuffs so I didn't have a lot of time. I felt a little bit guilty and he says, "Well, it's ah, I know, I know you do something different." He said, "I don't really know what it is that you do but it's different and I like for you to write about it." And I said, " Dr. Ivey, I don't think you do want me to write about it." And so I went home and I cranked up like 20 of the weirdest pages I can think of, of what it is that I do and I said, well then I fulfilled my commitment to the elder and then he'll leave me alone and, (laughing) and like that. And so I e-mailed him this really crazy stuff and so he emails back like in a few hours and he says, "This is exactly what I'm looking for." And I'm like, it's like, and now I, I have to do something 'coz he asked and, and that, and that ah, became ah, healing ah, the soul wound ah, the, the present work which is the culmination of what I actually have been doing and ah, and people say that I took a lot of risks. And ah, and I did because ah, you know that I say things, ah, ah, Derald Sue in a taped interview ah, ah, he said about me. And if you take it out of context, a little bit scary, he says ah, "Dr. Duran does very unethical things and then luckily," he's, he goes on to say, "but, you know, within the work that he does, some of the ethical standards of our profession are gonna have to be changed if we're gonna make a difference with the communities that we're working with." (clears throat) Ah, when I ah, got out of the military uhm, back in 1973 after serving 6 years and participating in the World War 2.7, uhm, I ah, I was working for the department of defense as an engineering psychologist, working on, on weapon systems and ah, kinda behavioral kind of things, interaction, human-machine interface and ah, I, after a conversation with my grandfather ah, something pulled me into the clinical side although, I, I, I thought that the clinical stuff wasn't really ah, exact science. Ah, 'coz at he time ah, uhm, also like a lot of the folks, well, some folks in this audience ah, who still was carrying that physics envy that ah, psychology seems to ah, still (inaudible ) with. And ah, even physicists don't have it anymore coz they realize that things are more mysterious than anything you can weigh or quantify. And ah, I started at my doctoral program and ah, one of the local Indian clinics ah, close to the school ah, kept trying to contact me, and they found out there's an Indian guy over there doing graduate sch, work so we wanna hire him to do something. And at the time ah, there was no programs ah, and mental health in Indian country was almost ah, non-existent as we know it now. And so I went ah, to the agency and they hired me and they hired me to do a needs assessment because ah, that's what you need to do, is quantifying needs. And it was really interesting because ah, I was taking community psychology and I was learning how to ah, do these things. And then you'd send out a survey and then you quantify all this stuff and you crunch the numbers and ah, and there you have ah, the situation, now you can go fix it. And I, I did all of it at the way I was supposed to do it. I sent out ah, all these questionnaires and surveys with the community health representatives who are, uhm, kinda like paramedics. In Indian country ah, a lot of places still have them and ah, they ha, they're on four-wheel-drive trucks and they go all over ah, remote areas and they help people with ah, vital signs and they do a lot of ah, mental health care themselves. And about a, a week or two later, the surveys all came in a stack of them and they were all blank. And, uhm, and I said, well, what happened? Uhm, didn't people understand, you know, what I was asking? 'Coz of course it couldn't possibly ah, have anything to do with me or the survey. And ah, what some of the old people sent word, and they said, "Well, the reason we hired you is because we thought that you had a grandmother that taught you manners, and why are you coming here ah, to us asking all these stupid questions? Ah, we know what the problems are and ah, if you just ah, talk with us, we will tell you." And ah, so I did and ah, luckily there was this elder woman that took me under her wing and protected me because, you know, (inaudible ) people are getting very hostile towards me 'coz, ah. And ah, once people saw that I was with Dorothy, they would kinda leave me alone. And ah, and then I was given instructions to go up into the mountains 'coz there was a mountain community and listen to the spirits. And so, here I'm working on my PhD, you know, taking community psych and doing class projects, and I'm supposed to go up there and listen to the spirits and then tell my teachers at the school that ah, guess what, you know, the reason the paper is late is because I'm up in the mountains listening to spirits. So you can see how that's just not, not gonna work very well. And ah, and, and the, the problems were obvious, very apparent and all of you who read ah, even preliminary literature on ah, native morbidity ah, you know the situation. There were some papers here presented yesterday that talk about that, you know, the high alcoholism, ah, depression, suicide rates, and all of that which are very obvious in this community. And when I would talk to some of the older people, they would say, "Well, those are not problems." And of course, in the back of my mind, I'm thinking denial ah, people are in, are in a grave state of denial here because ah, it's obvious what's going on to me and I'm not even ah, a trained psychologist yet. And so then ah, this is where my Columbo technique began 'coz ah, ah, the way I do therapy I, I call it ah, Columbo technique after the TV ah, guy in the white trench coat and cigar. And I, I just ask really stupid questions or very simple questions like why or what. You know, which is not ah, conducive to, you know, somebody with a PhD, but ah, it, it really works when you ask people just basic stuff. So I said, "Well, what's the problem then if that's not the problem?" And people, uhm, started saying, "The problem with our community is that ah, our soul has been wounded." I'll talk to somebody else, the other is a spiritual wound that happened here, and that's the problem with our community. So like a good gradual student, I go to the literature and ah, started looking up soul wounding and spirit wounding, and low and behold, there was no, not only soul wounding, there was no soul reference anywhere. And ah, and so I thought, this is, this is not good. I mean, how, how am I going to do this? And at the time ah, this kinda dates me a little bit. There was like two papers on Indian mental health, one was by ah, Carolyn Atne(ph) who's in the spirit world and ah, John Redhorse and that was about it. And ah, and the, the, the, the two papers and a little bit more from here and there, and so I was really stuck. Now, I have this information, soul wounding, spirit wounding, but now, what am I gonna do with it? Uhm, I happen to have a supervisor that was, had a (inaudible ) ban so it was okay to kinda use the S word in his presence, the spirit, the soul word because ah, everyone else at the school, at the time, CSPT was really, really struggling ah, to change their identity and become like every body else, and they started of as kind of a revolutionary ah, idea and then very quickly, they sold their souls for APA accreditation. (laughing) And, and, ah, and, and, and, and they got it and ah, and so, it was very difficult from me to, to, to do this work. So I had to do a lot of ah, ah, guerilla warfare, and at the time ah, I was reading the, the works of Che Guevarra, and ah, and it really helped to be able to walk in the middle of those worlds. And like I said yesterday, uhm, at that time also is when I found ah, my teacher ah, the elder that actually guided me through the process that has become ah, the, the work that I do now, and, and it's really important that I acknowledge that lineage. And ah, and Clarence(ph), uhm, who was a gentleman that I thought initially was gonna be a patient ah, became my teacher for three years. And for those three years ah, he really, really, aggravated me and tormented me in ways that you can't even imagine. He frightened me. Ah, it was a really scary process and because most of the things that he said at the time made no sense at all. And ah, ah, he talked in riddles, he contradicted himself con, continuously and I was like, I mean, it was enjoyable to be around him because, you know, he was so silly and then he was really interested in what I was studying and he would ask me every time I go see him, "What did you learn this week?" And I would tell him, and as paralyzed as he was, he, he would laugh so hard that he would almost bounce off the bed. And ah, you know, I'm going into debt for this information on student loans and, and he thinks it's funny. And so ah, (clears throat) on the ah, and, and it's remarkable 'coz ah, I didn't know who he was until ah, on June 19th of ah, 1986, I went to see him and he was sitting in front of his shack, on his wheelchair and, uhm, and he lectured me kinda like people have been lecturing here, very, you know, professional, kinda linear, whatever you wanna call it. And I'm like, "What's going on with him 'coz he doesn't talk like this?" I mean, he always talks in crazy riddles and now he's telling me very directly what I'm supposed to do. And ah, unbeknownst to me ah, that in two days later, which is the 21st of June, which is the solstice which is a very sacred day ah, for all original people. By the way, everyone in here is an original person from somewhere and I, he had one of his family members bring in his altar, which happened to be a, a pipe, and as he smoked that pipe ah, he expelled his consciousness into the spirit world. And then I knew that ah, Clarence was truly ah, one of those holy people that ah, we kinda read about in anthropological literature. And I thought, people could do that like 10,000 years ago, and I didn't realize that people could still do that, that you can get to a level of development within your spiritual practice to where at the last moment, even death will give you that last dance. And ah, at that point ah, he moved into the spirit world and ah, continues ah, through the dream time to ah, to, to help me out and, and continuously ah, laughing ah, at the stuff that ah, that, that I think I'm doing. And, uhm, but it was in the first contact that I really believed that, that that he gave me the transmission ah, for all of this, because it was during that first conversation with him that I literally almost passed out physically and I had no idea of what was going on and I just wanted to do is, is leave him and never see him again. And ah, it was at that point that ah, he gave what he needed to give me. For the next three years ah, he honed it down with ah, with this kinda Zen (inaudible ) things that kinda made peanut butter out of my linear brain 'coz he saw that my, that I needed that, that and I was so ah, I had bought into ah, this whole logical positivistic way of looking at the world that, uhm, I literally needed ah, a lobotomy and ah, and he performed that for me and, and I'm very grateful. And ah, even at that time, some of my ah, school colleagues were saying, "You know, you're really going the way. Ah, if you wanna become a psychologist and all this, you need to just kinda go in these direction." And even some of my, ah, native ah, relatives, brothers and sisters that were going through the field. I remember this one brother ah, who no laughs about it. He says, "You know, what we're gonna do is we gonna put you in all that Indian stuff and we're gonna freeze-dry you and we're gonna put you in the museum." He says, "Because this stuff is over man. This is a new day." And then modern psychology, the stuff that we're learning at school that's, that's where the world is going. And, uhm, and luckily Clarence uhm, resisted that and it was because of him that I even completed the school because ah, in those days it was very difficult to get through ah, a graduate program for someone like myself. Ah, it was a foreign place. And I remember one day I had decided to, to leave and drop, drop the school and I was leaving his house and he'd looked at me and he says, "You can't drop out." And I'm like, "Well you never went to school," and I said, "Why are you saying that?" And he says, "Well when you're done with this program, you'll have twice the power." And ah, only many years later have I realized ah, what he meant by that, and if it wasn't for having twice the power ah, I wouldn't be here talking to you today. So, so that's the ah, the, the genesis of ah, of, of the work that I do. I only, only have an hour. (coughs) So, uhm, the, the title, you know, is talking about liberation of psychology, liberation discourse. And ah, I'm gonna give you a ah, quick definition and ah, there's no need to take notes or anything like that because, uhm, it's, it's all rhetorical. It doesn't mean anything. (clears throat) Ah, liberation discourse involves taking a critical eye to the processes of colonization that have had a deep impact on the identity of original peoples. As a result, a new narrative of healing will emerge. The mental health profession has been instrumental in fostering the colonial ideation of native peoples all over the world. I'm merely bearing witness in bringing awareness to the, to this process to change it. By turning our critical eye in our professional activities of healing, we liberate ourselves or, as well. And ah, I need to ah, make mention of ah, Paulo Freire, who most of you have probably read and ah, his "Pedagogy of the Oppressed." In the very first few pages of the book, he delineates how in liberating ourselves, anytime you liberate yourself ah, it's an act of love, because in that act of liberating yourself, you also liberate the oppressor, because he's, she is tied in into, into that struggle of oppression and is dehumanizing for the oppressor also. And, and it takes ah, quite a bit of ah, of development to be able to want to do that because most of the time, in the revolutionary type of settings, we want to create more harm to the oppressor, which is basically part of the same energy cycle, you know, that has brought you to being injured in the first place.

DR. EDUARDO DURAN  So going back to Soul Wound, uhm, very quickly ah, I heard some people use intergenerational trauma, the, the term here. And ah, it's, it's basically ah, lot of papers have been written on this, ah, now and ah, people are actually crunching numbers around it and finding out that, "Yeah, this is real." So what the others told me about the Soul Wound, now the Imperial Sister are saying it's real, ah, but it's like 25 years later. And can you imagine the, the waste of time that would happen if we would've awaited for, for that validation? And ah, a lot of people would've continued, you know, in, in their suffering and ah, to me, that, that's not acceptable. If ah, if we see something that needs to be healed or be taken care of ah, it's not just ethical, it's the right thing to do and, and you, know, ethics is, is a conventional kind of idea. There is right and wrong and there is moral and immoral. And a lot of times, ethics ah, doesn't get to that place. And ah, the way that ah, this also came to me in ah, in the clinical setting, is that ah, early on, I, I, I realized that ah, I would be seeing an individual or a couple or a family and had the distinct feeling that there's a lot more people in the room with me. So imagine telling that to your ah, third year supervisor in a clinical internship. I am feeling the presence of ah, a lot ancestral people in the room and ah, they can actually see them, and sometimes they can feel them breathing and ah, and what, what would happen with that? And so I went to ah, a traditional healer and ah, and I said, "Bill, uhm, I'm getting this weird feeling when I'm talking to people that there's other people in the room. And very matter of fact, you know, he had this cowboy outfit on and he says, "Well, and that's because they're there." And I'm like, "I, I don't need to be hearing this. I mean. I want you to tell me that, you know, I'm, I need a ceremony to make it go away." And that's when he says, "Well, the reason they're there is because something happened and when it happened, they were not able to heal from that, in which who, who's in the room with you are the ancestors of the people that you're working with. And the only place that this can be healed is in this plain that's, that's the rule for some reason, and they're here also so that they can heal with their relatives. As they're healing themselves now, the ancestors are also healing." And ah, 'coz ah, there's a saying in Indian country that everything you do, every act, every thought impacts seven generations. But a lot of times, we think that the seven generations are the ones that come after, but it's also seven generations before us. So everything you're doing today, every thoughts you have ah, is really, really important. It's a real sacred place that you are every moment because you're impacting ancestors and unseen born ones that you'll never see with these human eyes but they are already in the spirit world, and at some point they'll come. And, so you can imagine ah, 'coz also some of the literature at the time were saying that native people did not respond well to therapy. And they say that most native people respond only to problem-solving approaches and insight-oriented approaches don't really work for native people. But you tell somebody that, that they're sitting at this center of seven generations each way and they get very insightful because they know that this is a very critical moment ah, of their life. And whatever they do for their healing, for their therapy is gonna impact all kinds of people that they have never seen, and especially the ancestors. Ah, a lot of people really, really revere the fact that ah, we, if we can heal the suffering of great, great grandpa's and gran, great, great grandma's, that's a really good thing to do and, ah, I believe that. And, ah, so that's, ah, real brief, ah, intergenerational trauma that we could talk for several days on that. The, ah, other thing that I wanna, ah, bring up before, you know, I, I actually talk about, ah, some of the cases is the, ah, the psychology of the healer. And yesterday, ah, to the group that was, ah, in the room and, and the only thing that I say today that's not rhetorical is, is when I ask you this question, and that's "Who are you?" Everything else is rhetorical except that, and, ah, and it's really important that you go in there and find out who you are. Not only when you're sitting there in front of, ah, ah, of a patient that's suffering but who are you all the time coz you really can't compartmentalize that. A lot of, ah, people in our field and other fields think, well, when I'm over there, as I see my three o'clock and I'm the brilliant, ah, Freudian analyst and then the rest of the time, I can do all these other crazy stuff. Well, it really doesn't work that way because it's all connected, it's all interconnected, in what you do, ah, the other time of the day, the dreams that you have and the spiritual practice that you have is impacting all the people that you see all the time. And that's really, really important, ah, that you, ah, find out who you are and that you yourself stand at the center of all the six directions, and try to do that as much as you can. And, ah, if you don't believe in the six directions, then, ah, maybe you can look at Jung's typology and try to reorganize your personality within, ah, Jung's types. And, ah, it's a real powerful tool to be able to use that. And, ah, yesterday, somebody made mention of, ah, ah, Black Elk, and, ah, and he taught this way. And he said that when he climbed the sacred mountain that he was at the center of the whole universe. And he says the sacred mountain was Mount Harney, South Dakota, which we know, Mount Harney is not the highest mountain in the world. But then he knew that also and he says, âEverywhere is the highest mountain.â Coz he was talking about an internal process. It had nothing to do with geography, and it's really important that you all find your sacred center and your highest mountain. And you stay within that place and find that place when you're working with people who are suffering. Because if you're not in that space, and, and you're not gonna be able to do a whole lot for them. Ah, I mean, you can give them other stuff and it's okay. It alleviates, ah, some of the initial suffering. But to really go into the depths of the soul work that most native people prefer, uhm, it's, it's important that you find your center of the world. So that it'll be a course probably in a, in a, in a graduate school called âthe center of the world,â huh? It's, it's also important that, ah, that the recognition, when we start talking about an intergenerational trauma, ah, because most native people are really aware of this, is that there, there's a tremendous raping process that occurred on Turtle Island. And Turtle Island is the traditional image for where we're standing on. And, it's, when the people of any place are insulted the way the native people were insulted and genocided on this place, the Earth herself also carries that injury. So it's really important that when you find that center of the world, that you also heal in that space of world that you're standing on as part of doing your healing practice. And that's what happened here this morning, is that the brother, by offering this medicine, these songs, these songs, ah, carry medicine with them, created a sacred space in here where the earth can now be at peace with what it is that we're doing. And so, she hears everything because everything we say is what she's saying, and what we hear is what she's hearing coz we are basically just a part of her consciousness. And I know that sounds, ah, pretty far out there but, ah, I hear that, ah, physicists and people like that are starting to say similar things to that. And so, what I'm doing here is, is, is, is moving towards a new narrative, to a new way of, of kind of conceptualizing everything that we do. And you don't have to be working with native people to do this. A lot of the, ah, ah, the European, Euro-American folks that I worked with, ah, they prefer this stuff. They say, they say, âWow, how come nobody ever told us about this? Ah, we want this, this kind of therapy.â And, and also what I'm telling you here is, is the extra that I do. Ah, I, I, I know how to do a lot of the other stuff that we've all been trained in, but you already know how to do that, so I don't need to talk about that. And so, what I wrote in this book was only kind of the, the extra piece that, that I add to everything else. And, and so, it's, it's okay to be a Western-trained psychologist that, and I, just a couple of days ago, my sister, ah, from Denver called and she said that somebody had gone to one of my talks and I said something negative about psychological testing and she proceeded to go back to her agency and destroy all her psychological instruments. And I'm like, âNo, don't do that.â (laughs) And, ah, I said, that's, that was not the intent, ah, it's taken out of context and she obviously didn't hear that everything I say is rhetorical and not to be taken seriously. Ah, you come up with your own stuff. This is just, ah, kind of a template and, ah, is, is nowhere near to be completed. Ah, we're, we got a long ways to go. The next thing that I wanna, ah, talk about, ah, as far as where we're concerned is, ah, how we view, uhm, the native people and, and other peoples of color when we're working with them. And, ah, I have seen over the time that I've been doing this work is that there's a tendency to pathologize, over-pathologize, ah, native people. And because of the lack of understanding of what's going on, a lot of times, people are over-diagnosed. And, ah, sometimes, some of our native people are diagnosed as schizophrenics simply because they might be speaking their native language and it sounds crazy to the clinician. And there have been a lot of atrocities committed, ah, in Indian Country within our lifetime and based on the practice that we do. Up to, ah, the last couple of decades, ah, a lot of, ah, our native sisters were sterilized based on Wexler IQ scores, and they weren't even told. They would get 85 or less. They were carted to the backroom of an IHS hospital and, and sterilized. And that was within the ethics of, ah, of the profession, apparently, because, ah, no one ever really said anything about it. And I've talked to people who, ah, were offered like a 100 or 200 dollars and as poor as they were, in order to have the, the, the procedure. And, ah, that's the kind of thing that has happened that has been sanctioned by, ah, by psychologists. The diagnostic process is a totally insane idea, ah, as far as, ah, when we look at it from a native const, context. The way I view, ah, the diagnostic process is as a naming ceremony. And in most traditional cultures, there are ceremonies that are held to give people names. Ah, when I gave you my spiritual name, there was a ceremony that involved doing that. Well, whenever you see a patient, you as the high priest or priestess, in, in that context, when you tell somebody, âYou are a major depressive,â you are literally performing a naming ceremony. And even if the Native person has been highly acculturated, that still seeps in to their psyche and to are, now they take on the identity of having, of being that, not just being visited by that situation. So, when you, you say somebody is an alcoholic, ah, they usually start identifying by that because you as the priest have had a naming ceremony complete with special language because in all sacred traditions, there's special language that we use. And, when you hear a psychologist talking in a backroom, they talk in this special sacred language. They talk about 300.02 and things like that, that only they know what they're talking about because it's a secret language and, and it's a sacred language. And so, make no mistake about it. When you do this to someone, you are naming them, and now they become it. And so, speaking of identities, like what this conference is about, we are masters of giving identities to people, even identities that they don't want. Uhm, and so, in this case, when we overdo it with the population that we might know, not know anything about, then we also become perpetrators of historical trauma. And these mi, these 'microaggressions' that, ah, brother Derald, ah, is talking about, ah, he, he's really a nice person, and that's why he calls them that. I, I call it âperpetration of historical trauma.â And 'coz it, it could be a microaggression but it still hurts your heart and it becomes an act of sorcery. And if it hurts your heart, then it becomes a spiritual act against the individual that makes you as a therapist, a psychologist that's doing this, makes you a perpetrator of performing bad medicine. And in Indian Country, yeah, that's well known when we perform bad medicine that it's, it's a lot worse than malpractice 'coz it carries a spiritual connotation to it also 'coz you're also harming the spirit of the person. And when you harm the spirit of the person, you're harming, remember, seven generations in each direction. So, it's huge. So, microaggression is really a big deal. And, ah, a lot of our, ah, bothers and sisters at practice in Indian Country, because of this, ah, I've seen the acts. I've worked, ah, at higher levels in the, ah, Federal Service. And when I was working in Indian Health Service, I was able to go around, and, and, and do site visits on some of the hospitals, some of the programs that, ah, were in, in my area. And I was appalled at what I saw, our brothers and sisters do, when they work in Indian Country, all the way from their charting or lack thereof, to lack of attention, lack of respect, lack of being able to diagnose, and much less heal. And so that's when it occurred to me that what this is called, what I call it is, I call it, "clinical racism," because all of these people are licensed, they are highly trained. And if they are working in another context, they would never have done what they were doing, ah, with our people. And so there's a lot of clinical racism that exists in a, in a practice, ah, towards native people, and there's a lot of perpetration of evil medicine that happens. I don't know what time I started so I don't wanna. (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
 We, we'll tell you if... (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
DR. EDUARDO DURAN Oh, you'll tell me, oh. 

00:40:30
 (inaudible ) four minutes. 

00:40:35
DR. EDUARDO DURAN I have three or four minutes? 

00:40:35
 Okay. 

00:40:35
DR. EDUARDO DURAN Okay. (laughs) Ah, the, ah, therapeutic circle, ah, it's really important that you pay attention to the container that you're working in and, ah, the office like I said, to do the ceremony of whatever kind you do, ah, to, to have that prepared before your patient, client, ah, walks in. And what I do every morning, ah, I try to, I, ah, I usually get there before anybody else does to the clinic. And then I walk around with some sage or some other medicine. I smoke off the place. And people that walk in, whether they're native or not, ah, they usually say that it feels very peaceful. That they really like the way the place feels. And a lot of them have no idea why but they say, "We, we really like, we really like where you work." And, ah, I wanna kinda go towards the end of this although there's a lot more, ah, in the subtext here and a lot more in between the lines. As changing the, the whole way of, of actually diagnosing, for lack of a better word. So when we diagnose people instead of, ah, saying you are a major depressive as to be able to deconstruct that and to be able to walk within the worldview of the native person, and what is really going on, 'coz there is no such thing as a, as a, as a major depressive thing. I mean, that we see. It's, it's a concept that means a lot of other things. And when you look at the DSM, and it's outlined in there and they have all these, all those criteria. For native people, I find that, ah, it really helps to talk about the suffering that they're going through as a visitation by something. And, and the jargon that, that I use with, ah, native people over the years is, ah, the, the spirit of sadness might be paying you a visit. See, which means a whole different thing than you are a major depressive disorder. I mean, just the words in that, ah, it just puts it in a whole other context. So, if something is visiting you, that means that it doesn't really have to stay if it doesn't want to or you can actually start relating to it. And, ah, I was working with a, ah, a young person who is probably the most depressed person I have ever seen in my life, ah, and, ah, was the only person that was actually even, I had actually even talked to a psychiatrist about ECT, which for me that's like a, committing the worst blasphemy in the world but, ah, the person was really, really suffering. And medication was, she was taking so much medication that, ah, she could hardly move. So that wasn't working. And it was only through this type of talk that the depression, the spirit of sadness began to move. And I'll never forget the day that, ah, that, that I told her, I says, "You know, I, I really don't know what else, to, to tell you. I, I, we've done everything else." And, ah, 'coz I also tell other patients that I say I gave them a choice. I said, "Do you wanna do this the White way or you wanna do it the Indian way?" And we're both, you know, in that way, we can do a little bit of everything. And ah, and for the longest time she, one, one, one point she says, what, "Are you like a real psychologist or what?" Which, (laughs) which to me was a huge compliment. And ah, and so I showed her that degrees on the wall and all that. She says, "Well, you could've got those anywhere." (laughs) And, ah, and there she is, she can't hardly move and she's crying. And I said, "What, what you need to do," I says, "Is you need to bless your depression, or the, the spirit of sadness." And, and she looked at me like I was totally crazy. But she was in such a place to where nothing else was working. And she says, "Well, how do I that?" I said, "Well, just like you bless anything." And so, you know, I gave her some, ah, ingredients, some good, I mean, something to, to smoke. And, ah, I mean to burn smoke and a, and a feather. So she could literally, (laughs) what? I can, I can, ah, I can, ah, on, only read my sister's mind, what she's thinking. (laughs) It was a sacred smoke. (laughs) Of course, it, it's all sacred right? (laughs) And so it's a, you know, simple sage, kinda like this and, ah, and burnt it and, and gave her an eagle feather and, ah, so she could just bless herself in a very soft way. Bless yourself and also the spirit, this entity that's visiting you because it's trying to teach you something. And it was shortly after that, that as we would say it, that the depression started lifting. That the depression started relating to her because at this point, she started telling me it's, it, it's really like I can see it now and it's not really me. See? So she was regaining her identity as a human being because that's really who she is. And she wasn't the major depressive disorder that she had been told by at least four or five, ah, therapy types and in several of her, ah, MD types, ah, all telling her the same thing. So you can see, she had, ah, many naming ceremonies telling her who she was. And it was only after she was able to bless this entity of, of the sadness. That the sadness was able to look at her and say, "Okay, sister. This is what I'm trying to tell you and then it could have a dialogue and enter the dreams." The spirit of the sadness will tell her what this is about. And, and then the person might still be sad. But then, they have a meaning about this sadness of where it's going. And then they, they can actually live, live life like that. 'Coz everyone in here has something. You know, there's an entity visiting everyone in here and trying to teach you something and it's aggravating and if it's pleasant, then it's not a good, it's not a good thing. It has to be aggravating. 'Coz, ah, ah, a lot times, pleasant things are, are tricks, tricks of the devil. (laughs) Yeah, ah, my sister yesterday was saying, ah, about how, ah, you know, it felt like church. Well, this is feeling like church, today. And so (laughs) and, ah, also, ah, with the, with suicide, which is kind of the, ah, the last straw in, in, in the work that we do, when somebody becomes suicidal, ah, we really get freaked out. And a lot of times to me, the way I see, ah, suicide, is also as an entity. And I get very encouraged actually, when people then express that they're suicidal. 'Coz then I feel and believe that finally, they're at the point where they're ready to transform because if there is no death, there is no rebirth. And finally, the, the spirit of sadness is taking them to a point where now, they wanna really transform in a big way. Of course, if we don't intervene and talk to them about what this could mean, they might kill this body, and a transformation will happen. But also they, a death can happen where the body stays alive and a transformation will happen. And this is where you need to provide that death for them. And so, it's a big task. Then, since you all are priests and priestess in here, then your task will become to provide a death in a therapeutic session of however long you think the session should go and allow the patient to die. But, and then bring him back to life. And, ah, just read a couple of a, of, of, just a little bit of a, of a dialogue ah, that I've had. So I, ah, I say, "Now that you have met the suicide spirit, what do you think? Is it what you thought?" Because I literally had a person who made contact with it verbally right there and talked to it. And then I, I have objects in the room called fetishes that em, embody the spirit of some of these entities to where they can actually talk to it, leave an offering to it and start making a relationship with that energy. Patient says, "Not at all. Now it makes sense, the dream with the vampire trying to kill me. It's okay if I let him kill me, kill that part of me that needs to die." I said, "Dying? What could that mean?" See it's kind of a, a stupid Colombo question that will assist the patient in gaining insight into the death, rebirth motif. She says, "Well, everything dies. It's just the way things are." I said, "Yes, and it all has a purpose of some kind. Like when you plant a seed of corn in the ground, you bury it, huh?" And so giving the imagery of the rebirth already so that when the patient decides to go through this process, there's also a resurrection image that goes right with it. Patient says, "The corn seed dies in the earth and it comes up again. Is that what I'm trying to do? I never thought of it that way. So when I wanted to kill myself, I really wanted to live, live in another way." There's about a minute of silence. "Yes, the suicide spirit, actually, was trying to help me. How come no one ever said anything about this?" I usually have choice things to, to that question but, ah, hmm. "I, I see you're very insightful and the suicide spirit is trying to show you something that's why I asked you to leave, ah, an offering. Remember manners? All spirits are good. They are here to help us. It's just that our egos like to control the universe. Last time I checked, creator was still in charge of the universe." And there's some laughter. 'Coz it's really good to have somebody who's suicidal laugh. It's a really good thing if you can do that and do whatever it is you have to do to make him laugh. It doesn't matter how, ah, well put together you are. Do something really stupid and, ah, it'll be good for you too. (laughing) "I say it's best when you don't fight against these energies. Take it from me. I've never won a single one of these fights so it's like creator, 10,000, and me zero." (laughs) "You would think I'd get a clue and stop the struggle, eh(ph)?" So I put myself in that same mix because I'm just like the person I'm seeing. I'm no better than they are. Ah, I struggle with, with the same things and at this point then also termination can become a lot easier 'coz I'm not this almighty powerful Shaman that has all the answers. I'm just a pitiful human being, uhm, just like everyone else. And she says, "When you put it that way, it really makes me wonder why we fight so much against all of this. I know it's part of our way to live more naturally and flow with things. I guess we've learned a lot of bad habits over the generations. A lot has been lost." And a lot of native people say this, "A lot has been lost," and that takes us in a whole other direction. One minute? Okay. So, so since I only have one minute, I'm gonna leave you with a poem and I really apologize for this 'coz, ah, I mean, it was just kinda really getting good but, ah, we have to stop. (laughing) Yeah, the patient stuff is, ah, is where it's at and, ah, that's where the healing lies in. I wanna read the "Wild Geese" by Mary Oliver. "We do not have to be good. You do not have to walk on your knees for a hundred miles repenting. You only have to let the soft animal part of your body love what it loves. Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine. Meanwhile, the world goes on. Meanwhile, the sun and the clear pebbles of rain are moving across the landscapes, over the prairies and the deep trees, the mountains and the rivers. Meanwhile, the wild geese, high in the clear blue air, are heading home again. Whoever you are, no matter how lonely, the world offers itself to your imagination, calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting, over and over announcing your place in the family of things. A hope (inaudible ) help. Thank you.

JOSEPH  Thank you. What a wonderful way to start the second day of our conference. And, ah, the way you started it, I, I thought it was wonderful. It, it, it reminds me and it feels as though you're giving us permission as well to think in different ways that, especially if somebody who's a training director. It reminds me that we don't have to follow, well now, I shouldn't say that. We shouldn't, ah, we should challenge... (crosstalk) 

00:54:05
DR. EDUARDO DURAN It's on tape. 

00:54:05
JOSEPH ...we should, yeah, it's on, on tape. We should challenge, we should challenge and be revolutionary in our thinking. So thank you.
