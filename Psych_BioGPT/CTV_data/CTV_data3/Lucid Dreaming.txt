THINKING ALLOWED with Jeffrey Mishlove 

00:00:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome I am Jeffrey Mishlove. Our topic today is Lucid dreaming with me is Dr. Stephen Laberge the author of the book Lucid Dreaming and exploring the world of lucid dreams Dr. Laberge is the founder of the Lucidity Institute in Palo Alto, California. He is also a research associate at the Dream Laboratory at Stanford University. Welcome Steven. 

00:00:55
STEPHEN LABERGE Thank you. 

00:00:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Let’s begin by defining lucid dreaming. 

00:00:55
STEPHEN LABERGE , PhD Lucid Dreaming Yes, lucid dreaming just means dreaming alone knowing that you are dreaming, so means being conscious of the fact that you are dreaming while it’s happening. Most people will have experience to lucid dreaming at least once in when you usually say in a nightmare recognize ah… this is all a dream and then waking up, but few people who have taking it to the possibilities that offers and the kind explored by the Tibetans for instance that you could stay in that dream and then use it to explore impossible realities somehow. 

00:01:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Some peoples think of lucid dreaming as being a distinct altered state of consciousness. 

00:01:30
STEPHEN LABERGE Well, it is definitely a unique experience in that the ordinary dreams we have every night, first of all a world that seemed as real as the one we are in right now. Yet, it's all clearly in our minds as we discover when we wake up. Lucid dreaming adds something extraordinary, it adds consciousness, full consciousness that you are dreaming at that moment. So you’re sitting here as we might be, when you suddenly realize that how he yes you went to sleep this afternoon and this is an afternoon nap and all this is going on in your dream for instance. Everything might seem just as real as it does right now, except where you would know that there wouldn’t be any loss of physics or any loss of society that you had to concern yourself, so it gives you a great deal of freedom at that point, but it would seem as real as this and it is an extraordinary experience. People find it astonishingly empowering to see that their mind has that capacity. 

00:02:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… In the another words you can do anything whatsoever in a… in the lucid dream state and do it consciously. 

00:02:35
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes, well anything within the limits of what is imaginable there is something’s that or say inconsistent with themselves that couldn’t be imaginable, but basically your limited not by the usual loss of physics and loss of society and other external constrains on you has we are limited greatly in waking life, but you’re limited only by what the limits of the mind might be which in practical terms often is your own expectations, so if you think you can't do something in a lucid dream state you cannot do it and in fact say if this were lucid dream right now and I, well this chair here is not really sawn, just a dream, so I should be able to pass my hand through it, but I might not be able to just because of my longstanding experience with chairs that they are solid and so that unconscious expectation might interfere until then I imagine for instance, at last I think of that chair is slightly porous and then my hand begin to pass through and then I am able by overcoming that expectation into pass the hand right through and in general we find that we are limited by our expectation. If you think that the door is locked you don’t find out that it's not, so it does not have to be locked. These mental constrains could be as much as constrained as physical exterior ones. 

00:03:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It would(ph) seen when they are practicing in the lucid dream state would be you are practicing the art of imagination. 

00:03:55
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes… yes, it’s very true that… that there is an art of lucid dreaming. It's not something that once you know oh… this is a dream then you know how to do everything. There are certain arts you have to develop to find out exactly how you can accomplish task because we have to overcome our very extensive sets of expectations based on our experiences in waking life because we have in perceiving the world around us right now a major determine of what we perceive is what we've perceived in the past, what we have seen in the past, what we therefore expect to perceive now and so one of the things that people when they are first beginning to learn with dreaming constantly are doing this, they are doing things that would make sense if they were awake, but don’t make much sense while they are in a lucid dream. So for example in one case I recall I was going across the dream Stanford Campus, I didn’t know its dream yet and I had left my briefcase behind, so I was going back to get that briefcase and now I realized I was dreaming and so this is wonderful, so I was ready to fly back to where I was going without immediately occurring well there is no use in getting that briefcase its only in a dream so it doesn’t make sense any longer, but you have to overcome those tendencies into rethink the new world we are in, I think what… what are the rules here, what makes sense for this new kind of life sphere I'm in. 

00:05:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So it's one thing to be aware of the fact that you are in a dream and maybe it's another thing to… to be aware that you are caught up in various layers of… of logic that… that you don't whether you can stay in or not as you choose. 

00:05:40
STEPHEN LABERGE That’s right well these are unconscious largely, these expectations about how the world works and so we don’t notice them until and the dream we notice this doesn’t make sense in the world I am in any longer then you’re able to change them, so there is a leaning process that goes on where you’re… you're thinking gets clear. You get more precisely adapted to the dream world because the rules of the dream world and a awaken world are… are very different and there are certain commonalties, but there is also very important differences and it’s important to know which world you’re in… in order to play the proper game. 

00:06:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Up until very recently the lucid dream although it’s been acknowledged by writers going back to Aristotle it wasn’t really accepted in modern psychology. 

00:06:30
STEPHEN LABERGE Well, yes that’s true. It wasn’t as you say Aristotle at least wrote about lucid dreaming, he said sometimes it happens that people will recognize while they are in the midst of sleep they were… they are saying is the dream and there are other instances throughout history where you see someone pointing this out, someone might use it for example Saint Augustine did as proof for life after death, because you see just as one can have this full experience of life without a body namely in the dream as he interpreted than the same thing must be the case after death. You see various mentions throughout history up until the 19th century when few pioneers in the west and they started to study the topic more extensively the Marquis d'Hervey de Saint-Denys wrote a whole book about lucid dreaming and… and had many thousands of experiences and… 

00:07:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE When was this written? 

00:07:20
STEPHEN LABERGE This was in the middle of the last century and his book was called the "Dreams and the means of guiding them" and he understood the fact that dreams were built out of expectations in past history and the general model you have of the world and had a very modern view of this, but as you mentioned until very recently a psychologist didn’t seem to believe in the existence of lucid dreaming. This came from a kind of paradox that occurred to them as they thought well to be asleep is to be unconsciousness because we say sleeping person is unconscious of what’s going on around him, but that does not mean that he is necessarily unconscious of what is going on inside his mind at that point, so they however generally to say to be asleep is to be unconscious. They also had the idea that dreams lucid or otherwise are unconscious processes which isn't really true. They have to be conscious process or it wouldn’t be able to remember them. 

00:08:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:08:20
STEPHEN LABERGE Now the fact that we can remember them shows that there is a certain level of consciousness present what’s normally absent from the dream is simply a specific reflective consciousness that what is going on now is all in my mind. That’s the difference, is not that people don’t see things that they consciously report. Now when I first started to do my scientific research on that topic, I had… had lucid dreams myself, so I knew they were real and then I got interested and started reading what other people know and what the scientific experts said about it and I found surprisingly that it couldn’t happen. 

00:08:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Some of the same express were even denying the existence of dreams altogether. 

00:09:00
STEPHEN LABERGE Well, that’s true. That you had a, that’s still a more extreme case. That takes a philosopher to do something like that. Philosopher’s who say well people don’t actually have these experiences during sleep. All they have is they have stories, they wake up and tell he’s a behaviorist philosopher, but I don’t think we need to discuss ideas such as that, but it seems reasonable to suppose that if you got the idea that sleep is a relatively unconscious process that if people report having the experience of knowing that there are in a dream that may be they were partially awake or having in a… a some sought of wake, sleep combination state of some kind and so that was totally unreasonable point of view that lucid dreaming wouldn’t be a phenomenon normal sleep, but it turned out to be exactly something that occurs in normal REM or paradoxical sleep. 

00:09:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Paradoxical sleep. 

00:09:55
STEPHEN LABERGE Well, the REM sleep, the state of rapid eye movement sleep, active sleep is also called was a originally called on the content paradoxical sleep because it exhibited so many unexpected phenomena of such an activated brain that they had to call it paradoxical. The sort of common sense idea of sleep, such a state of passive inactivity, nothing much is going on. You’re just resting some how and that is in the bad description of… of one phase of sleep, the delta sleep, the quiet sleep as its often called these days, but about 90 minutes after you've fallen asleep if you’re watching someone you find that their brains suddenly turns on as if its become awake, except for the body is still paralyzed. In fact it now is… is actually more paralyzed than it was in the other stage of sleep. That is a specific mechanism that causes complete loss of muscle tone. Then… then you see all kinds of other events muscle twitches, you see respiratory irregularities. If you… for example, you watch the family dog or cat you will see that they have got two kind of postures one that is sort of the this flings posture for the cat and the other is that flopped posture which is the REM sleep or the paradoxical sleep. Anyway people hadn’t expected to see such an activated brain in a sleeping body, but nevertheless as in the 50s when this was first discovered, the association with dreaming was also discovered and for may be 20 years there was a great deal of research done on the physiology… psychophysiology of dreaming based on studies of REM sleep and the conscious reports that people would make on awakening from these states. Now as I was saying I had both have the experience of lucid dreaming, so I knew that it was real and that was definitely asleep. I knew that because I could be in a lucid dream and I would say this were the dream right now it's come over. Here I experience this body that I feel in front of me. I know my physical bodies asleep in bed with the hands are under the covers. I don’t feel any covers. I don’t hear the clock ticking next to my bed, so I know this must be a sleep, I am not in sensory contact with the environment even when I look for the information I don’t find it there, so I know I'm in sleep and I know I'm vividly in another world, so how could I determine that this is actually happening during sleep. How could I prove that to someone else other than me? Well, I got the idea of how to do that from some of the work that have been done in the 50s and 60s with REM sleep. One study, actually a series of studies had shown that sometimes there was a very striking relationship between the direction, the eyes would move in the dream and the direction of the eyes in a sleeping body would move. So for instance, in one case a subject was awakened after showing a very regular series of left, right… left right, eye movements about two dozen and when they asked the subject what were you just dreaming? He said I was standing on the side of a ping pong table watching a very long valley and so it’s obvious that you could have a… a precise relationship between where you looked in the dream and what happens to your physical eyes. That’s the one… one of the few parts of the body that is not paralyzed during REM sleep, so you can volitionally move them. So I thought well in the lucid dream I certainly could look to the left and right and left and right and that could then be a signal indicating to the laboratory that I knew I was dreaming at that moment. So indeed we did that and found that when I became lucid dream and made that eye movement signal. It occurred during unequivocal REM sleep and so even say 10 or 15 minutes before into the REM period, so there was no doubt from that kind of proof that lucid dreaming was a reality of sleep that it happened during not some almost awake state, but during the paradoxical phase of sleep. 

00:14:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… Because all the other physiological measurements show that you were sleeping. 

00:14:10
STEPHEN LABERGE Exactly and… and so you might say that the lucidity in fact is the… the most paradoxical element of the paradoxical sleep. 

00:14:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE , PhD Thinking Allowed I want to point out that this seems like a scientific breakthrough perhaps of… of an almost significant thing you were able to from the sleep state actually transmit a message to people who are in the waking state. 

00:14:35
STEPHEN LABERGE Well that’s what one of our two reviewers when we made the first paper describing the results, we submitted it to the science journal and one of the two reviewer said exactly what she did, the other one said "Well I don’t know exactly what’s wrong with this study, but there is obviously something wrong with it because it's impossible." So it was rejected and in fact we… we went through some difficulty you know overcoming the bias against the idea of lucid dreaming. I was happy to… to know thereafter the data had been shown in… in scientific medians the sleep research society and so on that by and large people change their minds even they one that said it was impossible when they saw the evidence were tend to do so. All right well what do you know? There is more strange things happening in the sleeping brain and then we had realized. 

00:15:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And now you’ve been doing research in this area for the last 15 years or more. 

00:15:30
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes… yes, and it… it… it has been a bit of a struggle in turn. It's outside the main stream of supported research. For one thing you found that I said the dream research went on for about 20 years a little less than that because in the 60s and early 70s support, governmental support for dream research dried up and then when was left only with support for sleep disorders medicine and so that’s what happened to the people they used to study dreaming than focus their… their activities on looking out the what can go wrong with sleep and what interested me most is what could go right with sleep. How could we make the most use of it? How could we get the most for our the time that we have to spend asleep, which seems we third of our lives approximately. Why couldn’t we make better use of that time? I think there is a great potential in the dream state where we kind of sleep through our dreams and that we don’t recognize that their virtual reality in which we can do anything at that point instead we act out pretty much melodramas like our waking lives, only in our waking lives where things go wrong, because in the dream world things often go wrong because we believe our awake and… and we have difficulties. For instance, a… a typical dream that I will have from time to time is let's say after filming this interview I am on my way back to Palo Alto, so I'm gotten to the car and I'm looking for the freeway and I drive around and… and there was a freeway exit, or an entrance right here, there was you know, when I got off the freeway, but where is it now and well the problem is that's a dream and so it's not surprising that the dream does exactly represent my map of San Francisco. 

00:17:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In fact that’s almost one of the qualifications to be a dream is it's going to have these corky, discrepancies. 

00:17:25
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes, well dreams are constructed out of what's already in our minds. There is no external stabilizer for them there is no structure the physical world that keeps them constant and that is one reason for the… the great differences between the ordinary experience in the dream and in the waking state. I said earlier that in the dream state it can be just as vivid and real appearing as waking perception, but it is not a stable and does not because there is not something outside has to maintain that stabilization. 

00:18:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… So you began developing ways for people to use the dream, not just sort of be the passive recipient of the dream or at most you could share the dream with your analyst you know later on in the week and try and interpret dreams, but… but actually working with the dreams it… it sounds like a revolutionary idea. I think it’s been hard to except in academic psychology at least although there is, I'm sure a large popular following, but you’ve also pointed out that this idea goes back at least as… as far as the ancient Tibetans if… if not even to Saint Augustine. 

00:18:35
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes, well the Tibetans have certainly been using lucid dreaming as a practical application in their culture since perhaps thousand years ago and their use of lucid dreaming is as a advanced yogic practice, they only do it after they've already become experts in visualizations for example and have practice meditation for many years and so as one of their more advanced practice is they then attempt to recognize that they are dreaming and they use that as a means of experimenting with their perception of reality in… in generalizing from I see everything in the dream around me and I can change it. You know I can change your height, I can change your sex, I could change you into a pilot for example and all of these things because its only an image and I will then recognize from that I can then generalize and say well I am awake, when I see you I see an image. Now there may be actually someone there in the physical world it is true, but what I see is in my mind and so they then understand that everything they see must be in their minds and that then gives them a new view of the difference between on appearance and a possible reality beyond it and so they use it as a kind of means of… of transcending the ordinary notions of what reality is and so they develop various techniques that they have been using over the ages some of which we have adopted in some ways to western practice, given that as I said it's an advanced practice in the Tibetan tradition the techniques for inducing lucid dreams among the Tibetan yogis are actually quite complex, there is you know imagine a Thousand-Petaled lotus with various symbols inside of it vividly and well that’s already something that might be difficult for the people to do. If you spend 10 years doing that sought of meditation of course that's… 

00:20:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Comes naturally! 

00:20:35
STEPHEN LABERGE That’s right! So one of the things we had to do is understand what were the essence of these techniques and take it out of the Tibetan cultural context and put it into the western one which as simplified is… is what it really is done. Yet, we have still developed techniques that have been quite affective. 

00:20:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… And I suppose in passing is probably useful to mention that there are other cultural sources for working with dreams besides the Tibetans. 

00:21:05
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes, well, most other cultures in the world take dreams more seriously than our western culture does and I… I think that some of the work with lucid dreaming ought to change some of these ideas that in the West we think of dreams as airy nothings by and large and that these are things that are just in the mind that have no real impact. 

00:21:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE (Inaudible ) one of the major current theories equates dreams to being like excretions just sort of the… the residue with the… the waste of… of the brain. 

00:21:40
STEPHEN LABERGE That’s right! Or… Or even what you’re trying to forget, or what you trying to get rid of somehow and I don’t give much credence to those theories. I don’t think they make sense in terms of understanding of why would such a device evolve. I think it’s much easier to understand by saying, well, when we dream we use exactly the same mental machinery as we use while we perceive in the world while awake. It’s the same mechanism, but under the special conditions of sleep, so when sensory input is cut off, so there is very little sensory input then what we are left with is what within our own minds, our past experience, our motivations, our expectations and all the rest of that, then build a dream world that tells us about what’s in outside of ourselves, but it’s not doing it to send messages or to tell us something, it’s doing it because the mind, the brain is… goes on by evolution to tell us what’s going in the world around us and what to do about it, how to get want we want and avoid what we don’t want, and it does it. Anytime it’s working well enough which happens during REM sleep and the brain gets turned on and active enough. 

00:22:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So you began devising methods for enabling people to enter into the lucid dreaming state almost at will? 

00:22:55
STEPHEN LABERGE Well, when I was first studying this… as PhD student at Stanford back in the late 70’s, I had the… the main challenge of being able to have lucid dreams myself in the laboratory, because I was having dreams, lucid dreams more frequently as I was trying to develop the skill. But if I would be in the laboratory on one night out of the seven in the week and I didn’t have a lucid dream there it was useless, so I had to develop a technique that I could use on the night hours in the laboratory and I was able to develop a technique based on prospective memory or memory for future intensions. We have sort of the rudimentary capacity to remember what we want to do tomorrow, for example. Well, we can apply that capacity to what we want to do later tonight when I’m dreaming, so I developed the technique based on the (inaudible ) scene, visualization of myself in the dream that I just woke up from I saying the next time I'm dreaming I want to remember to recognize that it’s a dream, and that led with some practice to the ability to have lucid dreams whenever I wanted to do. And then, which was very useful for our laboratory studies but… 

00:24:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You also developed a device to help awaken people or am I getting ahead of the story? 

00:24:15
STEPHEN LABERGE Well, we actually started working on external stimuli as a means of helping people who have lucid dreams back in the late 70’s. The idea was, well, if we’re trying to remember to do something when we’re in the dream state, then we want to best to give ourselves remainders, just right now or you don't want to remember to do something tomorrow you write a note, but… but sorry to write a note that you’ll see in the dream world, so we used the fact that external stimuli is what’s going on the world around you as you’re sleeping sometimes appear in your dreams, the alarm clock goes off, but you don’t wake up instead you dream about the alarm clock and then you changed into a siren or something. So we used that fact. First all we used the technique of having tape recordings being played during REM sleep, if that would say this is a dream, and that would appear in your dream and say, this is a dream, oh yes, so it is. But it also tended to wake people up frequently, because we use our auditory sense, our ears to monitor the environment for danger as we sleep. So we… the idea of trying other sensory modalities that might not be so subject to awakenings and the one that was most successful was light. So I first started out with goggles, that welders’ goggles and then the sleep goggles that had lights in them that would then flash during REM sleep. 

00:25:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… The instrument would detect that you are in the sleep state that there is REM movements, rapid eye movements? 

00:25:40
STEPHEN LABERGE Well at… Well at first we… the instrument was the sleep technician watching a polygraph while the person is asleep. 

00:25:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Pressing a button. 

00:25:45
STEPHEN LABERGE That’s right, exactly! And… And we had success with that particular method and… and we started then building devices say, well, may be it takes a lot of work for somebody watching the record all night and… and causing the stimulus to occur just when the person is in REM sleep, so. 

00:26:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! Well we’re running out of time… time. I supposed the point is that you’ve been successful in… in developing these devices and… and using them in the laboratory?. 

00:26:10
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes! That’s right! Well, not just in the laboratory, but we developed devices that… that do have sensors built under the mass that could be used at home, so that… that of course was one of our major goals which used to have make lucid dreaming available in general to people so that they could make better lucid dream. 

00:26:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And… And now with through your lucidity institute in Palo Alto you have a team of I think hundreds now of people you call them Oneironauts, who are the explores of the dream world, who… who report these experiences to you. 

00:26:40
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes! 

00:26:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Stephen, we’re out of time now, but it's been a pleasure being with you for Part 1 and I hope those who are viewing and watching will check the guides for Part 2 of our series on lucid dreaming. Thanks so much for being with me. 

00:26:55
STEPHEN LABERGE Great! Thank you! 

00:26:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And thank you for being with us.

THINKING ALLOWED with Jeffrey Mishlove 

00:27:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome, I’m Jeffrey Mishlove. This is Part 2 of our two part series on Lucid Dreaming, dreaming when you know that you’re dreaming. With me is Dr. Stephen Laberge, the author of Exploring the World of Lucid Dreams and also Lucid Dreaming. Dr. Laberge is the founder of the Lucidity Institute in Palo Alto, California and he is a Research Associate at the Sleep and Dream Laboratory at Stanford University. Welcome Stephen. 

00:28:05
STEPHEN LABERGE Thank you! 

00:28:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We’ve talked in Part 1 of this program about the history of lucid dreaming and about your efforts to develop scientific methods that would allow us to study the lucid state in a particular your breakthrough in which… in which you developed means by which people in the lucid dreaming state could actually communicate with waking people in… in the laboratory. All of this of course suggests to me the question why… why is lucid dreaming significant anyway? 

00:28:40
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes, what would you like to do with it? And well, this is a question people often ask and we also had gotten a lot of mail from people who heard about our research at Stanford and we got some 10,000 letters from people who wanted to know about lucid dreaming, but who also told us what they had been doing with it and from these 10,000 letters we extracted various examples that went in then to the second book, and in that you could see five or six general areas of what people were doing with it. The… The first thing was adventure. Exploration in a adventure where you can fly, have dream sex, do anything that you want, anything imaginable. So it’s a sort of the lowest common denominator there is that… that thrill. 

00:29:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's better than reading a fantasy novel. 

00:29:25
STEPHEN LABERGE Well, much more real. It’s… It’s better virtual reality, it’s a state in which it does seem real and it’s… it’s unexcelled in… in some respects that the feeling of freedom and acceleration one can have in lucid dream as you realize that all those going on is in your own mind and you’re perfectly free there. So people who are experience, it’s a kind of euphoria from lucid dreaming and I note it's still legal, so this should interest many people for that reason. Now, in addition, one step beyond the… the lowest common demeanor there is the use of lucid dreaming as a rehearsal for living, as a mental practice. Athletes for instance use waking imagery to improve performance and at the most of vivid imagery you can have is what you experience in the lucid dream and so we have anecdotes for people who have used lucid dreaming to… to practice some new skill or to overcome performance anxiety, for example, by playing in front of the dream audience and then generalize to… to the waking state so that if you practice in the dream state some motor activity your brain is doing the same thing it would do if you’re actually practicing that without the external constraints. So you can see just how to get that dance step or the golf swing and so on so people… 

00:30:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Oh! By playing the piano? 

00:30:50
STEPHEN LABERGE Yeah, without worrying exactly where the… you get the feel of it, it’s… it’s what comes from that. 

00:30:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Something is going on while you’re actually doing the rehearsal at a deep level in your own brain? 

00:31:00
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes! Well, the scientific research that we have… have been doing in the past decade has demonstrated very strong mind, body parallelism in the dream state. Essentially, since we’re… our bodies are paralyzed while we are dreaming, our brain is… is able to go full tilt in programming motor output, because it… Let’s say, I’m doing something like dancing and my brain… while I’m in dreaming my brain will be sending the same impulses to my legs as it would if I were actually doing the same dance steps. Now, when they get to the level of the spinal cord they’re… they’re stopped at that by the spinal paralysis, but on the brain end of things and the programming of the motor sequences, it's the same thing. 

00:31:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's remarkable! 

00:31:50
STEPHEN LABERGE And… And so we found very strong mind, body correlations that if you hold your breath in the dream, for example, your respiration actually stops, if you estimate a sequence of… of dream time say counting 1001, 1002 up to 10, it turns out to be exactly parallel to physical clock time passing. If you engage in dream sex that it shows physiological responses much like what you’re experiencing with “real thing”. However, without any of the competent dangers one would experience in the real world. In general, that to the brain when you’re dreaming it’s real, just as to your experience ordinarily as you think that you’re actually awake and doing these things that you seem to be doing in your dream. So, that has a… an important impact that I’ll come back to in a… in a moment. 

00:32:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It raises to philosophical question about reality I should think. 

00:32:45
STEPHEN LABERGE Oh, yes! Well, this certainly raises many philosophical questions about reality. Reality as we know it really, because our experience is really the realities that we experience directly. It’s… People have the idea that there… that you look through eyes and see the… the world as it is, but that’s not true, you see the world as you believe it to be and that’s the model world. But before getting to that kind of philosophical idea, I’d like to talk about some of other applications that people most typically apply lucid dreaming. For one is creativity, that the dreams have long had their repetition of being a source of creativity in… in many fields from art to science. And in all of these cases, people might have had a big dream that solved a problem for them, but it didn’t happen deliberately, it just happened after years of working on a problem and it pops out with the answer in the dream. Now, what we have wondered is what, why couldn’t you go to sleep with the intension of making news of it to say. Tonight, I’m going work on a problem. I’m going to find out what the title of my the next book will be or something of that nature. I’d like, if I am a painter, may be I’d like to get an idea for a new painting, so in the next lucid dream I have, I visit the dream gallery which is say just down the hall which I then imagine that I go down through this door and I’ll see the fantastic paintings left unpainted by me as yet. And artists described doing exactly that and then memorizing what they saw and then when they come back to the waking world painting that. We don’t yet know how… how readily people can use the problem-solving aspects. We have many examples, anecdotes, people using lucid dreaming as a problem-solving means ranging from art to mathematics, computer programming and writing. So I think it’s a good deal of potential there, but one have to see what is going to come of it. An area that I think that is very well established be greatly useful is overcoming nightmares. Most people will at some time in the life experience some nightmares, some people maybe 10% of the population have nightmares every week for instance and some cases are plagued by these for many years and it’s very common for children to experience a period where they have many nightmares. The basic solution to that, we believe is, number one, have the… person having the nightmare realize it’s a dream and therefore, that they are safe in a sense that there’s no real danger there. Yet you still when you realize you’re in a nightmare all the fear doesn’t vanish. You still have the feeling that it's got a certain reality to it just as, for example, when we’re in the movie watching a horror film, we know it's just a film, yet we can experience the emotions that might go with fright, so people then have then face their fears. They look and say, what is this thing I’m running away from, for example. And we found that, by facing the fears they lessen just by the courage required to face them, but also you can then transform the frightening dream characters in some way by dialoging with them and talking, who are you and what can I do for you, to a threatening figure. And when you do these kinds of things the dreams spontaneously generates transformations whereas kind of inner progress takes place. But any cases it seems be a very good way of dealing with nightmares, but also has a means of inner growth as a path of self-development. So, it’s a kind of a personal therapy. It’s something I think that would be very usefully incorporated into many other forms of therapy ranging from the cognitive behaviorism to union depth psychology and both, you know, and all along the line you can see ways in which having the ability to take responsibility for what’s going on in your dream could be of a great benefit. 

00:36:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Some of the most interesting stories that you wrote about in your book are those in which the dreamers encountered, I would call them teaching figures. 

00:37:00
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes, yes! Well, any dream figure you encounter is potentially a… a teacher if you view the figure in that way and… and in fact there… there is a wonderful cartoon of Gary Larson that shows two little ladies standing at the door and they’re out the window on the porch as this giant bug and the one little lady says the other, yes calm down right now, yes I know it's some giant hideous insect, but it could be a giant hideous insect in need of help. And so you should have the right idea which is it’s a frightening image, but now what? Now, how can I relate to it? What’s the best the way I can encounter it? The most flexible, creative, adaptive approach to my unconscious mind and that’s what lucid dreaming allows. It allows you to be conscious about what it is you’re doing and to bring your ideas into to say, here is the way I would like to work with myself. I would like to overcome fear for example. I like to face what I find inside myself, to take that first of all as my first duty to accept myself as I find myself including all the shadowy dimensions that we find in our unconscious mind. Once you’ve done that and there are other possibilities for transcendence. 

00:38:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It’s for basically making me unconscious conscious? 

00:38:15
STEPHEN LABERGE That's right! Yeah! 

00:38:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It seems to be the program. 

00:38:20
STEPHEN LABERGE That’s it, well, which is to say getting to know yourselves. It’s another less… 

00:38:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Intimidating way. 

00:38:25
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes, yes! Now… So that’s really the mental health application. We also believe that there may well be physical or psychosomatic health implications of lucid dreaming. Given the very strong mind-body relationships that we have found in our research, we think that it must be possible to find by certain kinds of lucid dreaming imagery to facilitate the functioning of the immune system and optimize heeling. We know from many studies that the waking altitudes and the psychological state affects many physiological mechanisms associated with health. So the idea is it perhaps we could make better use of our dream state to consciously help ourselves heel, help ourselves get back into a state of organization that we can control what’s happening to ourselves and we have anecdotes. 

00:39:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE This is an area that you’re… that you’re researching? 

00:39:20
STEPHEN LABERGE Well, only indirectly at this phase. We have anecdotes, people writing those letters, describing they’re having used lucid dreaming for heeling purposes. But it's hard to tell, because these are never control studies. 

00:39:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Of course, well there is a book out now by Patricia Garfield, Dreams that Heels, so at least regular dreams we know have… can have that impact? 

00:39:40
STEPHEN LABERGE Well, and then exactly and of course this idea goes back to the Greeks of using dreams as… as a healing process and there is no question that it works on the emotional level. 

00:39:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hippocrates himself was trained in a sleep temple. I happened to visit the island of Kos in which dreams were very important in the heeling process. 

00:40:00
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes! Well, unfortunately we haven’t been able to do any direct research on this. The research that we’ve been doing is more basic in terms of establishing the mind-body relationships during sleep, but with the limited resources that we have, we’ve had to focus on making the state available. Because, let’s say we discovered the lucid dreaming as very useful for healing, yet if it’s too difficult to achieve then that will limit its value, so we’ve been focusing on making it more available and that’s the reason for focusing on researches with devices like the Novadreamer and making things to help people be able to have lucid dreaming. 

00:40:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Now, you mentioned the Novadreamer, that's a device available through the Lucidity Institute in Palo Alto where you have hundreds of people who are engaging in… in the lucid dreaming process and participating in experiments with you. 

00:40:45
STEPHEN LABERGE Well, we actually have a… a few thousand members of the Lucidity Institute in 30 countries around the world, all engaged in this endeavor of exploring the dream state and what can be done with it. It’s very exciting. These are all people who wanted to somehow be a part of the research offered in so we found a way by having experiments that people do at home and they send in the results and we describe them in our newsletters and as a way of involving everybody that wants to be a part of this research in finding out what could we do with our dreaming brains. 

00:41:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Let's talk about flying. 

00:41:20
STEPHEN LABERGE Hmm… hmm… Yes! Well, flying is… is certainly an accelerating fun thing to do and it's one of the first things that people do with the lucid dreaming. We recommend it in fact as a… as a first goal for lucid dreaming, because it tells you the moment that you do it that you’re not in the waking world and you’re not in Kansas anymore, because now the extent to which you follow the laws of physics is entirely up to your own mind and so people flying at the air and have great fun doing that and this is happens, children do it all the time for instance. And I may add that children, I think can learn lucid dreaming very readily and it would be a wonderful thing if we all had been taught lucid dreaming as children as being one of the uses of our minds and one of the things we could do while we’re sleeping. It might have been easier to get us go to bed if we’ve been told that. There’s one other area of application that I think is… is very important and that is the idea of lucid dreaming as opening the mind, as providing an intimation of wider world. 

00:42:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Even into spiritual dimensions? 

00:42:20
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes! It’s that, because when you’re in a lucid dream state and you realize it suddenly everything is different. You know your possibilities are entirely different from what you have thought a movement ago, but it goes deeper than that. It's also when you look at who you think you are. So, let's suppose it’s Stephen were asleep in bed now dreaming, so this character here would think he was Stephen, say I’m Stephen right now I am talking to you. I realize I’m dreaming so what do I think? I think you are a dream figure. Yes, and I think I’m dreaming maybe, that’s what I think at first, but then I saw reflect toward myself and say this is a dream chair, a dream jacket, this must be a dream hand and so what is this? It’s a dream Stephen. So what I thought was me a moment ago, I now know must be only an idea, and so now my idea of… of… of what I am has changed. 

00:43:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And who you are? 

00:43:10
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes! I now see that what I was mistaking for myself is actually a model of the self, it’s only an idea really. Then that’s what… 

00:43:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It’s a very boost way of listening at it. 

00:43:25
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes! So that opens up a question which is, well, what am I? And what am I on the deepest level? And so one can ask in a lucid dream, I would like this dream to be an expression of the deepest potential in me or the highest possibility or reveal the God within or my true self, however, whatever term fits your understanding, you can then ask for the lucid dream to direct you in that way instead of deliberately controlling that and you’re deciding, I am going to fly in this dream, instead it’s, let me be guided in this dream by whatever is the wisest part of me to the… whatever experience would be most useful next. So it takes on a different attitude away from a kind of control to more like a even surrender of control. 

00:44:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And… And what are kinds of experiences people have when they do this? 

00:44:10
STEPHEN LABERGE Well, some people see God, some people have experiences in which they see some representation of… of metaphysics the universe. For me, I… I pursue this theme of lucid dreaming for some six months and reached a culmination in one lucid dream in which I was driving down the country road in my sports car knowing I was dreaming from the very beginning and I see an attractive hitchhiker by the side of the road and I am of course inclined to stop and pick her up, but I think I've had that dream for. So, the moment I give up the hitchhiker the car starts to fly into the air as I think I want this to be an expression of the highest potential and the car disappears as I fly to the clouds and I see in the clouds symbols of traditional religions, a star David in a steeple with a cross in top and your eastern symbols and then I fly above the clouds and my body has now disappeared too and I enter a vast emptiness, a space that the… the most surprising aspect is that it seems to be filled with love, it's like a homecoming. It feels like this is where I am from. Now, I sort of started sitting overwhelmed with joy about the existence of this state that was behind all the rest of my images somehow, this emptiness filled with potential. And I woke up and was greatly puzzled at first about what that was all about. Then I realize though on reflection that this is showing in a sense where we come from and where we’re going and what is here now, as I realize in thinking about this that… that we… our brains are designed to see what changes, because evolution is… is focusing on danger and survival and that implies very directly change and sudden change especially. Anything that is very slow in changing, we would don't perceive very well, and anything that never changes, we don’t perceive at all. So, I could see by sort of indirectly in this dream that, what is most unchanging and therefore, let’s see most real is also wanting to be exactly invisible to the eyes and yet the dream had a way somehow showing me the state. It made a real difference in the way I understand life and death and the world. Of course, I don’t expect my experience to convey to anyone else unlike the experiments with signaling eye movements which are objective scientific evidence which you could believe even if you didn’t have the experience. For an experience of that sort, it’s good for one person only. 

00:46:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:46:50
STEPHEN LABERGE Your ticket to the experience is your own lucid dream and what you would make of it in your own terms. 

00:46:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But at least you can provide people with… with the tools to have that experience. 

00:47:00
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes, yes! 

00:47:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You often slight the writings of Sufis and… and other mystics you question, you know, whether our everyday reality isn’t very much like a dream and in fact the Tibetans as well? 

00:47:10
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes! Well, the common sense view of waking life is overly optimistic. It holds that we are normally conscious. We normally know what we’re doing. We don’t make silly mistakes as we do in the dream state, but in fact if you observe everyday life, you see it as shot through with strange errors, while you make mistakes you forget things, you mistake one thing for another and we’re actually typically in a kind of a waking trance state somehow or… or a sleep walking as… 

00:47:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Many critics would suggest waking life is… is… is full of absurdities as the dream life is. 

00:47:45
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes it is, and… and whereas, unlikely to notice those absurdities in the waking state and the dream state I believe. So, the… the spiritual teachings have often emphasized this model of Man is Asleep. And the idea of that, it’s possible to wake up in a sense of life and then the lucid dreaming provides a metaphor for that, wherein the sense that in ordinary dream you don’t know that you’re asleep, you don’t know that this is happening while your body is sleeping in a bed and that… and that none of what you’re experiencing will be there when you wake up later. When you become lucid in the dream, suddenly you have a new model of… of reality which includes the next level up, the level of the sleeping body and you see the world you’re in in a very different way. One could then see a kind of metaphor and such as… as ordinary dreaming is to lucid dreaming so as the ordinary waking state to some more awakened to waking state and you could understand how it could be that, there could be something more than this… 

00:48:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:48:45
STEPHEN LABERGE …which we think of, well this is it, this is a wake, so it opens your mind to the possibility of a further development. It doesn’t necessarily make it happen, but it shows you that it could happen. In that sense it has a potential such as, for example, psychedelics may have, sometimes they show people the possibilities of development. They seldom take people there, but it shows that something can be done, that there’s more to achieve and then sets a higher goal that people can then follow, I think most sensibly by finding teachers who may know. 

00:49:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, you've mentioned, of course, lucid dreaming is legal and… and it’s safe and now the work that you have initiated has been going on for well over a decade and I think we can look forward to seeing… seeing more developments along these lines in the future, you’re really just beginning. 

00:49:35
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes! Well, I… I certainly hope so. My… My view is… is that in… by the end of the 90’s or when the millennium has arrived, I very much like us to be able to say, we now have a state in which anyone could experience, on any night they choose, any imaginarily reality. They can have any imaginable experience. It’s like the personal and virtual reality then we always shoot these brains if we find out how to make use of that and apply it, and I think it’ll be a great potential for human betterment and change, because consciousness is what is required to change and we’re in the current situation of needing to change more than we ever have in our history and so to the possibility, for example, to try out alternative realities. Let's see if I’ll go down this road where will it take me as the deepest part of my mind understands? Or if I go down this road and to make more sensible choices, more informed choices based on the deeper knowledge that we have in ourselves. 

00:50:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… Well, that’s certainly worthwhile vision if I’ve ever heard one. Let me ask you this question. I’ve often been puzzled by the… the reality question here. You suggested that the modern view is that dreams are not real, that they are images, but I'm… I'm not at all convinced that we know what images are, simply to say they are only images doesn’t suggest to me that images are not real in an ontologically sense. 

00:51:00
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes! Well, that… that may be. I don’t know whether images are ontologically real, I do know that they are experientially real, and perceived reality is what counts, that’s what we… what passes for real for the person at the time is real, meaning that, real change can happen in response to it. 

00:51:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:51:20
STEPHEN LABERGE So, the encounters that we have in the lucid dream are real to the person at the time even though you may know it's just in my mind and it's not in some other world, that doesn’t lessen its value. We still can learn from it. 

00:51:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But haven’t… haven't as a researcher, you looked into that question, can two people enter into the same lucid dream for example? 

00:51:35
STEPHEN LABERGE Well, we haven’t done any research in that. That’s a kind of thing that you hear from time to time, people suggesting it can be done. I don’t know. My… My view is that… that usual way things are in the dream state, is that they’re… it's all yours, it's all inside in your own mind and… and that’s got an advantage, meaning that you're not constrained by anyone else or anything else. But that doesn’t mean it must always be that way. 

00:51:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right! You certainly, in your… in your book cited a couple of exceptions, for example, from the Sufi literature? 

00:52:05
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes, yes! And clearly there’s one case where we do have mutual dreams and that is the waking state. Right now you in your mind see me and I in my mind see you and that each in our own dream, but it’s the dreams that are shared. Thanks to something we call the physical world. 

00:52:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right, normal reality. 

00:52:20
STEPHEN LABERGE Yes! 

00:52:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah, yeah! Well, we’re… we’re running out of time and yet there’s so much more to explore. Perhaps we can close by talking about a related issue. How do body experiences? Many people have talked about near death, out of body experiences entering into what they think of this… there’s some kind of other spiritual reality and it seems I believe you think this is very much a kin to the lucid dream? 

00:52:45
STEPHEN LABERGE Well, I think it’s very much like lucid dream. I've had out of body experiences myself and so I understand how they seem different from ordinary dreams and how they seem different from lucid dreams. My view in the very short time we have would be that they are dreams and… and that doesn’t lessen their possible spiritual significance one jot or tittle, it's still an experience. And the reason I believe that they’re not experiences in physical reality is simply by applying consistency. When I float out of my physical body, I look around and I find that I am not in a physical bedroom. Therefore, I look back and I say, yes, well, it can’t be my physical body, because it would have to be in a physical bedroom and then I have to rethink the experience. People in… having the experience of leaving their bodies take it as literally. It feels like leaving your body, and so don’t often have the presence of mind to say, well, what’s really going on here? Usually you are too frightened, you know. How am I going to get back there? 

00:53:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:53:40
STEPHEN LABERGE But it’s certainly a very interesting area to explore. We have done the laboratory work on the out of experience which shows that they’re much more likely to happen if it’s a momentary awakening during REM sleep and then it leads then to dream content that… that shows a body in bed. 

00:53:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah…Uh… It’s not so different from the lucid dream? 

00:54:00
STEPHEN LABERGE No, we think it can be understood in exactly the same terms as the lucid dream. 

00:54:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Stephen Laberge, it's been a real pleasure sharing this half hour and the previous half hour of this two part series. Thanks so much for being with me. 

00:54:10
STEPHEN LABERGE Likewise, thank you. Pleasant dreams. 

00:54:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Indeed! And thank you for being with us and pleasant dreams to you as well.
