Emily Dailey, LCSW 

00:00:10
EMILY DAILEY Hi, I am Emily Dailey, I'm a licensed clinical social worker and I work in private practice and I work at UCSD Eating Disorders. Millennials have been inundated with all this advanced technology. In this digital age, our brains have an insatiable urge for seeking new things. And now, with the internet and cell phones, we have a limitless source of novelty in our fingertips. We can't stop pressing the search button, looking for another hit at dopamine. We're information junkies and our brains are definitely full. This can lead to anxiety, depression, OCD, addictions, and a loss of connections with our selves and with our life. So, we end up using technology to escape in the effects of not being present are deleterious. Our brains need some real downtime. Now, downtime doesn't mean watching a movie or something chill with friends. Downtime means quiet, really simple, totally open time in which you're not working, not accomplishing anything, or taking in new information. 

00:01:15
Mindfulness Meditation 

00:01:15
EMILY DAILEY Mindfulness meditation is a technique we use for this. It is a kind of alert, relaxed openness, where you are not thinking of anything in particular and also not striving to remove anything either. Our brains need downtime in this modern digital age, where there is too much novelty with the Internet, cell phones, and too much interesting, interesting stuff to do, talk about and see. Mindfulness is used in therapy, to help clients experience their emotions in the present with you. It helps them ground into their bodies, it creates exposure to their emotions and thoughts. We use mindfulness in therapy to strengthen new behaviors and positive mind states. Next, I meet with Melissa, who is struggling with over thinking and anxiety. You will see us run through three different mindfulness exercises. 

00:02:05
Exercise One 

00:02:05
Rewriting your Brain 

00:02:10
EMILY DAILEY Hi Melissa. 

00:02:10
MELISSA Hi. 

00:02:15
EMILY DAILEY It's nice to see you. 

00:02:15
MELISSA You too. 

00:02:15
EMILY DAILEY Yeah, welcome back. 

00:02:15
MELISSA Thanks for having me. 

00:02:15
EMILY DAILEY Mm-hmm! I know we were talking last week about umm… some of your anxiety, about interviewing with jobs and stuff. Just kind of wondering where you're at this week? 

00:02:25
MELISSA Umm… honestly pretty much the same. I have, I think I, I'm just always thinking about it, there's never a moment I'm not thinking about even anything. 

00:02:35
EMILY DAILEY Mm-hmm! 

00:02:40
MELISSA But lately, job interviews have been really just, on my mind I guess 'cause I'm giving myself a timeline. 

00:02:45
EMILY DAILEY Mm-hmm! 

00:02:45
MELISSA So I'm just thinking about how badly it could go. 

00:02:50
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. So you're having anxiety with a job interview. Yeah. And does this affect you in the job interview? 

00:03:00
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:03:00
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:03:00
MELISSA I feel like a really awkward doing job interviews and it ends up. 

00:03:05
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:03:05
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:03:05
EMILY DAILEY Yeah, that's totally normal when you're really anxious. So, what I'd like to do today is maybe do a little mindfulness exercise with you. 

00:03:10
MELISSA Okay. 

00:03:15
EMILY DAILEY Umm… one of the cool things is, first, anxiety is very normal. Umm… a lot of people experience anxiety around job interviews. And you know, our minds tend to go towards the negative and focus on the negative things. Umm… the brain can be rewired. Like, we can activate the neural networks umm… that for a positive emotions, for umm… confidence. And so that's one of the things that I would like to do with you today umm… is to be able to get you into a place where you're really feeling a time when you felt umm… like sure I can do this and really try to umm… get those grooves in your brain umm… wired in this. 

00:04:00
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:04:00
EMILY DAILEY Umm… okay, so if you can put your feet flat on the ground maybe and close your eyes. I'd like you to identify a time in your life, where you have felt the feeling, "Sure, I can." Or have you, you were felt really confident, you have felt like, "I can do this." 

00:04:30
[sil.] 

00:04:35
EMILY DAILEY Do you have a time in your life when? 

00:04:35
MELISSA Yes, umm… so, it was when I was back home in Singapore and I was at this job in the hospital and I was just, I guess I was doing pretty good work 'cause I was getting really good feedback and good, really good evaluations. So, I think that was one of the moments I felt like, "Okay, I was doing something right." 

00:05:00
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. And you felt like confident and sure I can do this. 

00:05:00
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:05:05
EMILY DAILEY Okay. So I want you to have a visceral sense of confidence in your body arising from this moment. I really want you to feel in your body what it felt, feels like when you feel confident, when you feel like, "Sure, I can do this." 

00:05:25
[sil.] 

00:05:30
EMILY DAILEY Just breathing into it umm… allowing if your body posture needs to change, umm… just really allow yourself to immerse into the feeling of being confident, of feeling like, "Yes, I can do this." 

00:05:50
MELISSA Umm… I feel like I find myself setting up a little bit more. 

00:05:50
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:05:50
MELISSA When I, because I imagine myself in that place and standing up straight and walking. 

00:05:55
EMILY DAILEY Yeah, yeah. 

00:05:55
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:06:00
EMILY DAILEY So you cam feel it in your body what it feels like to be confident. And just remember that we're talking about, about a moment here, not necessarily a whole event, but how it feels like in the moment to feel confident. And focus on that sense of mastery that success brought you. How does it remember to feel a sense of mastery in your body now? 

00:06:35
MELISSA I would say, just feeling like I was knowledgeable enough to be able to get that task done. 

00:06:45
EMILY DAILEY Mm-hmm! 

00:06:45
MELISSA I guess it feels really satisfying and in, in the sense like I'm not useless or unproductive. 

00:06:55
EMILY DAILEY Mm-hmm! And where do you feel it in your body? 

00:07:00
MELISSA Honestly, my chest. 

00:07:00
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:07:00
MELISSA Yeah! I don't know, if it's my heartbeat, but my chest. 

00:07:05
EMILY DAILEY Mm-hmm! Do you feel, we, you set it all, it feel, it feels like your shoulders are back, maybe your chest is higher. 

00:07:10
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:07:10
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:07:10
MELISSA Umm… my heart's beating a little bit faster, but in a good way. 

00:07:15
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:07:15
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:07:20
EMILY DAILEY I really want you to take in this feeling right now, of how it feels in your whole body of feeling confident, feeling like, "I can do this." 

00:07:35
[sil.] 

00:07:40
EMILY DAILEY When you feel ready, you can open up your eyes. Bring your attention back into the room. 

00:07:45
[sil.] 

00:07:50
MELISSA Okay. 

00:07:50
EMILY DAILEY How did that feel? 

00:07:55
MELISSA Umm… calming, soothing. 

00:07:55
EMILY DAILEY Mm-hmm! 

00:07:55
MELISSA Yeah, I didn't expect it to be, 'cause I didn't think I could just calm down. 

00:08:00
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:08:05
MELISSA Umm… I was really just breathing… 

00:08:05
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:08:05
MELISSA …which was really strange 'cause I don't think I have ever focused on just breathing. 

00:08:10
EMILY DAILEY Mm-hmm-hmm! 

00:08:10
MELISSA Really just always thinking. 

00:08:10
EMILY DAILEY Yeah! Yeah! So you can bring this up at any time really, you can use this in your life, you know, bring up that feeling that you had. It, it, in, you could bring it up before you walk into a job interview of how it feels in your body, umm… what it feels like to feel, yes, I can do this I feel confident. Umm… and each time you do that, you're rewiring your brain. 

00:08:35
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:08:35
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:08:35
MELISSA Okay. 

00:08:40
Exercise Two 

00:08:40
Dropping the Anchor: 

00:08:40
Mindfulness Exercise 

00:08:45
MELISSA I feel like, I have just been feeling really stressed. Umm… feeling a lot of anxiety lately, I feel like I'm always on the computer, my work requires me to be typing. And I don't know if I like it that much, just looking at a screen all day. 

00:09:00
EMILY DAILEY Mm-hmm! How many hours a day, are you working? 

00:09:00
MELISSA Eight. 

00:09:05
EMILY DAILEY Okay. 

00:09:05
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:09:05
EMILY DAILEY Okay, what are you doing after work? Are you spending a lot of time on your phone or…? 

00:09:10
MELISSA Umm… not really but I'm spending a lot of time on the TV. 

00:09:10
EMILY DAILEY Okay. 

00:09:15
MELISSA Other screen, I don't know if I like it, but habit. 

00:09:20
EMILY DAILEY Right, right. And it's causing you to feel more anxious, do you feel like? 

00:09:20
MELISSA A little bit just 'cause everything, things are still going on, on TV. 

00:09:30
EMILY DAILEY Right. 

00:09:30
MELISSA You know, people are moving around. 

00:09:30
EMILY DAILEY Yeah, absolutely! I mean it's like you're not getting really any downtime. I mean, that a lot of people think that watching TV is downtime umm… and it, it's really still activating for our brains. 

00:09:40
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:09:45
EMILY DAILEY Umm… to be watching TV and then you're on the computer, it's like, all day long your brain is never really getting a rest. 

00:09:50
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:09:50
EMILY DAILEY Umm… have you umm… ever heard of mindfulness? 

00:09:55
MELISSA Umm… briefly in before. 

00:09:55
EMILY DAILEY Yeah, so this is an intervention that we use, umm… it's really about taking a break, you know, giving some downtime to your brain like we can't umm… constantly be on our phone, on that Internet, on the TV. Umm… it really has a lot of umm… not great effects for our mental health. 

00:10:15
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:10:15
EMILY DAILEY Umm… and anxiety in particular, you know, anxiety in depression, I don't know if you feel like kind of loss of connection with yourself or with life. It's, it's, because you're not really ever being present, right? And my fullness is so simple, it's really about being present in this moment, umm… and just being with whatever is. A lot of people have these misconceptions that uh… meditation is like stopping your thoughts or umm… not thinking. 

00:10:40
MELISSA Mm-hmm! 

00:10:45
EMILY DAILEY Uh… well, that's not realistic, you know, you're always going to think thoughts. Mindfulness is a way that it is a different way to be able to relate to our thoughts and our emotions. Umm… how would you feel if we went through a little mindfulness exercise here in session? 

00:10:55
MELISSA I think it'll be good. 

00:11:00
EMILY DAILEY Okay. So if you feel comfortable, if you could put your feet flat on the ground, being grounded is very important mindfulness. Umm… and this is an awareness exercise, it's not relaxation. You can find relaxation and mindfulness umm… but it's really about awareness and kind of grounding into your body. I always say that like we have an addiction to thinking in our culture. And umm… I, I want to bring you from the thinking mind more into your body. Umm… and, and I think you will find that there is a big difference. 

00:11:30
MELISSA Okay. 

00:11:30
EMILY DAILEY So, if you feel comfortable, close your eyes. Allow yourself to turn your awareness to your breathing. Begin to follow your breath as it comes in and it goes out. Allow your shoulders to drop. Allow your face to relax as you follow your breath in and out. 

00:12:10
[sil.] 

00:12:15
EMILY DAILEY As you follow your breathing, begin to imagine a ship in the middle of the ocean and see a big strong anchor that goes from the ship down into the water and deep into the ocean floor. 

00:12:35
[sil.] 

00:12:40
EMILY DAILEY This anchor keeps the ship safe and secure. No matter what the ocean waters are like above. 

00:12:50
[sil.] 

00:12:55
EMILY DAILEY Imagine your breath as a kind of anchor. As you exhale slowly, drop your anchor and see it take hold on the floor beneath you. 

00:13:10
[sil.] 

00:13:15
EMILY DAILEY Continue to follow your breathing as it comes in and out. As thoughts arise in your mind, allow them to pass by as you bring your awareness back to your breathing. 

00:13:35
[sil.] 

00:13:35
EMILY DAILEY Imagine for a moment that the waters are calm above you. 

00:13:40
[sil.] 

00:13:45
EMILY DAILEY Take a moment to see if you can find that place of calmness within your own body. 

00:13:50
[sil.] 

00:13:55
EMILY DAILEY See if you can locate a feeling of safety and security inside yourself. 

00:14:00
[sil.] 

00:14:05
EMILY DAILEY You might even recall a time, when you felt very safe and secure. Think about that time and notice what happens in your body as you do. 

00:14:20
[sil.] 

00:14:25
EMILY DAILEY You might also imagine going to a familiar place where you feel peaceful, calm, and safe. 

00:14:30
[sil.] 

00:14:35
EMILY DAILEY If you can't feel this inner stability or safety, that's okay too. Do not force it. Just hold open the possibility for it as you continue focusing on your breathing and visualize the anchor of the ship. 

00:14:55
[sil.] 

00:15:00
EMILY DAILEY When you are ready, change the scene slightly to one of rough waters at the surface of the ocean. See if you can use your breathing to find your own inner anchor. That sense of calmness that lies beneath the waters if you go deep enough. See if you can imagine the waters rough at the surface, but calm deep underneath. 

00:15:35
[sil.] 

00:15:35
EMILY DAILEY Continue to hold an image of an anchor in your mind, in that sense of stability that the anchor represents. Now, imagine that there is a storm at sea. Visualize the storm in all its intensity. And then see the storm passing. As the ship remains safe, because it, because it is anchored securely to the ocean floor. As you imagine the storm, see if you can find your center that calm stable place within. And again notice what it feels like in your body. 

00:16:30
[sil.] 

00:16:35
EMILY DAILEY Use your breath to anchor you by returning again and again to your inhalation and exhalation. 

00:16:45
[sil.] 

00:16:50
EMILY DAILEY Now when you'll feel ready, I want you to call up a difficult emotion that you are currently experiencing or one that you have experienced recently. Choose something that is not too intense or overwhelming. Perhaps, a recent frustration or irritation, disappointment or stress. See if you can allow this feeling to be present while you continue to focus on your breathing. Visualize your breath as an anchor. And simply be with whatever feeling is there without needing to change it or make it go away. 

00:17:40
[sil.] 

00:17:50
EMILY DAILEY We need to stay with this for a couple moments. And when you're ready, I want you to bring your awareness back into the room. 

00:18:00
[sil.] 

00:18:25
EMILY DAILEY You can open your eyes and bring your awareness back into the room. 

00:18:30
[sil.] 

00:18:35
EMILY DAILEY How did that feel? 

00:18:35
MELISSA It felt like I was on, on a beach. Umm… I was thinking about my safe place or just my happy place being on the beach with my dog. 

00:18:50
EMILY DAILEY Mm-hmm! 

00:18:50
MELISSA Umm… it was so strange to me that I realized how tense my shoulders were that I actually, when you told me to loosen them, I actually slant down… 

00:19:05
EMILY DAILEY Yeah, yeah. 

00:19:05
MELISSA …and they were actually that high up. 

00:19:05
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:19:05
MELISSA So… 

00:19:10
EMILY DAILEY What does it feel like to have your breath as the anchor and the, could you tell the difference between having your breath as the anchor and there is still thoughts going on, but now you have like a little distance between them, did you feel that at all? 

00:19:20
MELISSA A little bit, I felt like I was in a bubble. 

00:19:25
EMILY DAILEY Okay. 

00:19:25
MELISSA My, my breathing bubble. Yeah. 

00:19:30
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:19:30
MELISSA And stress and everything was outside, but it was manageable in someway. 

00:19:35
EMILY DAILEY Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm! Did thoughts still come up as you were doing this? 

00:19:40
MELISSA Umm… a little bit, but I was outside my bubble. 

00:19:40
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:19:40
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:19:40
EMILY DAILEY Okay. 

00:19:40
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:19:45
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. So mindfulness, practicing mindfulness really helps us to be able to gain a little bit of distance between our thoughts and our emotions. So right now, it may feel like anxiety or worry or over thinking, it's like it takes up all of you, right? And it just feels like that's what's happening. Mindfulness allows us to take that break, to take that space in between those thoughts, emotions, umm… body sensations, you know, whatever it may be. Umm… in really to be honest with you, you're going to find yourself more productive. If you can umm… take some moments each day to, to do maybe a little sitting mindfulness exercise, umm… just grounding yourself, giving your brain a rest, giving your mind a rest, umm… you'll find that you will be more productive, I think throughout your life. 

00:20:35
MELISSA Okay. 

00:20:35
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:20:40
Exercise Three 

00:20:40
Mindfulness of Emotion 

00:20:45
MELISSA So I'm feeling all this anxiety and I, I don't even want to feel it. 

00:20:50
EMILY DAILEY Mm-hmm! 

00:20:55
MELISSA I… I find myself just taking drives, taking long drives and listening to music 'cause then I'm just looking ahead, I'm not, I'm not, I'm just focused on the road and really just not turn and think about anything else. I just don't want to feel it. 

00:21:10
EMILY DAILEY Right. Do you feel like you were anxious a lot of the day? 

00:21:15
MELISSA A lot. 

00:21:15
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:21:15
MELISSA Pretty much. 

00:21:15
EMILY DAILEY Yeah, do you have like certain triggers, what makes you…? 

00:21:20
MELISSA Umm… honestly, my alarm clock, because then that sound just reminds me that, "Okay, I have all these things to do, I got to start my day." 

00:21:30
EMILY DAILEY Mm-hmm! 

00:21:30
MELISSA And… yeah. 

00:21:35
EMILY DAILEY So what were you doing to avoid things like, you're trying to manage your anxiety? 

00:21:40
MELISSA I think, I find myself really just picking up my phone and going onto Instagram and Snapchat and Facebook. 

00:21:45
EMILY DAILEY Yeah, yeah, so, really trying to avoid the anxiety. What happens after you do those things? Are you more interest or less interest? 

00:21:55
MELISSA A little bit more. 

00:21:55
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:21:55
MELISSA Umm… but I still do it. 

00:21:55
EMILY DAILEY Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Umm… so anxiety is an uncomfortable feeling for you to feel. 

00:22:05
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:22:05
EMILY DAILEY Yeah! What is uncomfortable about anxiety? 

00:22:05
MELISSA My heart, it's always racing. 

00:22:10
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:22:10
MELISSA And I feel like, tingly, just always moving, moving, moving. 

00:22:15
EMILY DAILEY And does it feel like if you feel it like it's going to keep increasing? 

00:22:20
MELISSA A little bit. 

00:22:20
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:22:20
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:22:20
EMILY DAILEY Yeah! Umm… how would you feel, are you feeling anxious right now kind of talking about somewhat this? 

00:22:25
MELISSA Yes, yeah. 

00:22:25
EMILY DAILEY How would you feel right now in this space to umm… like, experience the anxiety just a little bit? Don't worry, I won't let, it won't go like a way through the roof. 

00:22:35
MELISSA So deliberately, feeling the anxiety with you. 

00:22:40
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. Yeah. 

00:22:40
MELISSA Uh… okay, we'll try. 

00:22:40
EMILY DAILEY Okay. 

00:22:40
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:22:40
EMILY DAILEY You want to put your feet flat on the ground. 

00:22:45
MELISSA Okay. 

00:22:45
EMILY DAILEY Can you tell me where you feel anxiety right now in your body? Maybe just take a couple breaths. 

00:22:50
MELISSA Umm… my heart for sure, my stomach, yeah. 

00:23:00
EMILY DAILEY Anywhere else in your body where you feeling anxiety? 

00:23:00
MELISSA My right arm. Strangely, I, maybe it's 'cause I'm right hand, I'm just always doing things. 

00:23:05
EMILY DAILEY Yeah, yeah. 

00:23:10
MELISSA So, let's take a couple of moments to just breathe in to those body sensations. You can close your eyes if you would like, you can keep them open if you would like. And what I, I want you to pay attention to, if you could just be here with the anxiety allowing your body to relax and seeing if these sensations, do they move? Do they change? Do they decrease? And really taking like a, a stance of curiosity towards these like, oh, this is interesting and this is what anxiety feels like, you know, you can label it, anxiety, anxiety, anxiety. 

00:23:55
[sil.] 

00:24:10
EMILY DAILEY Has it shifted at all? 

00:24:10
MELISSA I feel like… 

00:24:10
EMILY DAILEY Increase, decrease, I mean, its okay whatever happens to it. 

00:24:15
MELISSA My… it's still in my arm and my heart. 

00:24:15
EMILY DAILEY Uh-huh! 

00:24:15
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:24:20
EMILY DAILEY Does it change at all? 

00:24:20
MELISSA It's still a little bit as I still feel it a little bit. 

00:24:25
EMILY DAILEY But, has a change like, do the sensations, do the sensations maybe move to different places umm… in your heart, in your arms? 

00:24:35
MELISSA They're moving up to my shoulder. 

00:24:35
EMILY DAILEY Okay. 

00:24:35
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:24:35
EMILY DAILEY Okay. How does this feel? 

00:24:40
MELISSA Honestly, it feels a little bit nice. 

00:24:45
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:24:45
MELISSA Just 'cause I'm just looking at the ground and just breathing and something I don't really do. 

00:24:50
EMILY DAILEY Mm-hmm. 

00:24:50
MELISSA I never do. 

00:24:50
EMILY DAILEY Mm-hmm. 

00:24:50
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:24:55
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. Because you are not to the anxiety, this is an emotion that you experience. And actually what happens is the more that we avoid the anxiety, the higher it goes. Umm… so it feels like, "Oh, if I can do something like Snapchat or Instagram maybe it'll go away if I just ignore it." 

00:25:15
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:25:15
EMILY DAILEY But it actually increases. 

00:25:20
MELISSA Yeah, yeah. 

00:25:20
EMILY DAILEY So taking some moments to, even to just call it out, you know, to sit with yourself and call out the anxiety allowing it to be there. Umm… there's a saying umm… "What you, what you resist persists." So, the more that you resist the anxiety, the more that it persists. 

00:25:40
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:25:40
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:25:45
MELISSA So, we need to just attack it or to just be aware of it? 

00:25:45
EMILY DAILEY Yeah, to be aware of it, to be able to sit with it to know, usually what happens with all our emotions, they go up and they peak and then they come back down. So allowing yourself to sit with the anxiety, watch it come up go back and they go back up again, you know, but being able to know that this is not permanent that you can work through this. 

00:26:05
MELISSA Yeah, yeah. 

00:26:10
EMILY DAILEY That it's not, the anxiety is not like all of you. 

00:26:10
MELISSA And it moves. 

00:26:10
EMILY DAILEY And it moves. Yes, right, because when we're ignoring and are resisting it, it kind of feels like it stays stuck, right? Like maybe, on your chest or in your shoulders. 

00:26:25
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:26:25
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:26:30
Concluding Remarks and Observations 

00:26:30
EMILY DAILEY So Melissa, we've done three exercises, umm… we've been talking about mindfulness, kind of introducing you to mindfulness. I'm just wondering, how you're feeling about umm… some of our work that we've done and umm… kind of where you're at with your feelings on mindfulness? 

00:26:45
MELISSA Yeah! I am actually pleasantly surprised that I could just stop and breathe and even just close my eyes with you in this room and just, just think of the beach and things that make me happy. 

00:27:00
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:27:00
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:27:00
EMILY DAILEY Yeah! It feels good to take a break. 

00:27:00
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:27:00
EMILY DAILEY Yeah! And I think, you know, I think maybe you're a little bit of an overachiever and feeling like you always need to be working and need to be doing something? 

00:27:10
MELISSA No, but… 

00:27:10
EMILY DAILEY In finding that, actually taking a break makes you more productive. 

00:27:15
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:27:15
EMILY DAILEY Umm… and actually makes you less anxious. 

00:27:20
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:27:20
EMILY DAILEY Umm… because yeah, we, we, we need breaks. But mindfulness, you know, in general umm… can be a little bit difficult thing to learn kind of incorporate into your life. Umm… and I think you've done a really great job so far and umm… we can continue working on like different exercises and ways to incorporate mindfulness into your daily life, because there are so many different ways that you can bring lesson for umm… you know, just having small breaks in your life. 

00:27:50
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:27:50
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:27:50
MELISSA Thank you! I feel like this is really helpful, I was just looking at the ground and I honestly couldn't remember what I had to do umm… later. 

00:28:00
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:28:00
MELISSA So I didn't think I would be able to get here. 

00:28:05
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. Yeah. You can just, I hope you can sort of see the difference between like the thinking mind and the body, like there's, there's a difference. Umm… yeah. 

00:28:10
MELISSA For sure. 

00:28:10
EMILY DAILEY Yeah. 

00:28:10
