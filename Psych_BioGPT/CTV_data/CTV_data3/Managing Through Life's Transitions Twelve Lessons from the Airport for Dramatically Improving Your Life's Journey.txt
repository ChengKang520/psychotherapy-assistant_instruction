MARCUS GENTRY A few years ago a movie came out. Title of the move was called Akeelah and the Bees. Some of you may have seen that movie. It was a young girl who was about to enter into a spelling competition. And she had a mentor who was working with her. And he had worked with her all the way up. She ignored a lot other family members and friends and siblings and things like that as she was getting closer to the competition. And when it real close he said he wasn’t going to help her any more. Pulled back. Said she was on her own. She had what she needed. And he wasn’t going to help her. This was when she needed him the most. And she said, no – he said, no, I’m not going to – to do it anymore. Well what happened immediately, she started discovering that all of the people that she had been passing by, and the things that she had been seeing were lessons that were already available to her. To help her be able to successfully win the competition and transition through this particular period in her life. Now, why is that story so important. It’s because when we become students of life, we learn that everybody that we meet becomes our teacher. But everything that we experience and many of the things we see can become life lessons that can help your clients and ultimately help you be able to manage through various transitions in our life. It’s all about trying to handle that transition. And as we go through life as we go through our journey, no matter what season of life we’re in, we will experience various transitions. And there are certain things that we can notice around us that can help make that transition and journey a whole lot easier. I travel quite a bit so I spend a lot of time in airports. And I – while sitting in the airports started noticing how many of the things that I was seeing around me were lessons about life. I’m going to share a few of them with you. And see if you can’t notice the same thing. And what I’d like you to do, again, is look for one element of all the lessons that I’m going to share with you, look for one element, one piece, one snippet of information that might be able to you’re your client manage through a transition they’re going through. Or maybe even help you or someone you know manage that transition. So, as we prepare to go through our – uh, take a trip to the airport and go through the airport, obviously want to make sure we have our identification. Right, we’re not going to spend a lot of time on that. We’re going to make sure that we know what our destination is. But let’s examine that just a little bit closer. Making sure we have our identification. Knowing clearly who we are. So that we can go where we want to go. What if we turn that into looking into our lives. Knowing truly who we are in our authentic self. Isn’t it true that many people now aren’t sure who they are. Because they see images portrayed on television of what they should wear and what weight they should be. And what size they should be. And how they should wear their hair and what’s popular and what’s not popular. And what purses they should have and what cars they should drive. And their identity in many cases is attached to their possessions. So many people don’t quite know who they are. And if you don’t know who you are, your journey through life will be rather difficult. And many educational systems don’t focus on helping the students learn who they are. That’s the ID. We can spend all day on talking about that one, couldn’t we. The next one is determining your destination. Knowing exactly where it is that you want to go. Why it would be foolish to go to the airport and not know where you’re going, wouldn’t it. Did you know some people are traveling through life that same way. They don’t really know exactly where they’re heading, what success looks like for them. They’re following what some body else is doing. And they – to the untrained eye looks like they’re being successful. They have got the new job, they got the promotion, they got the degree, they bought the house, they got married, they got divorced, they had – they did all the things that some would say would be success. But at the end of it, they’re not happy. You know why. Because it really wasn’t their destination. It was what somebody else said that they ought to do that would be successful. They, as I put it, had their ladder on the wrong building. And as always somebody waving their flag isn’t it. Saying this is – if I were you I’d raise my family this way. And I was you this is the way I would dress. And I would handle my finances. And this is what I think you should do. There’s always somebody waving their flag suggesting what you should do. Determine your destination. That’s just a couple of the intro to things that we learn at the airport. But there’s another thing that we learn at the airport. And let’s focus a little bit more on this one. And that’s deciding which airline and gate is going to get you to where you want to go. So you see, some people standing and they look at the board that’s in front of them. And they try to decide which airline. And that’s critical, isn’t it. Because if you get on the airline that’s not to the destination you have in mind, you may not be too satisfied. Is that right? So you have to make sure you’re getting on the one that’s actually going to carry you to where you want to go. And you’re at the right gate. Let’s look at this in terms of our life. Are you in a vehicle that’s heading you to the destination that you actually want to go in. Let’s look at your relationship. The relationships of your client. If they keep doing exactly what they’re doing, you keep doing exactly what you’re doing, will the relationships that’s important in your life be where you want them to be at the end of the trip, as it would be. Will it get you closer whether it’s to relationship with your co-workers, whether it’s your relationship with your – your spouse, your – your siblings, friends. Are you in a vehicle that’s getting you closer to where you want to go or is taking it off course. What about finances. Are you in a vehicle, do you have your money in a system. Are you handling your money in such a way that’s getting you closer. So one year from today you expect to be financially better off then you are right now. Is that the system that you have in place. Is that the vehicle that you’re traveling in in terms of your finances. How about your health. Are you comfortable with the way you are health wise. So as you look at the board trying to decide which pattern, which course, which, uh, life practices you’re going to follow to get you to where you want to go. Is it something that’s leading you actually to what your true destination is. But to make that decision you have to be still and look at all your options, don’t you. Look at the consequences. A friend of mine who’s a film director lives in California. I went to visit him a couple of years ago. And he took me up on a mountain. And we were up there, and we were overlooking the mountain. I’m telling you it was beautiful. It was peaceful. It was quiet. I said, my goodness. I said, do you bring many people up here. This is nice. He said, no. I said no, why not. He said, because for some people it’s just too noisy. I said, what do you mean too noisy. He said, when it gets quiet like this, you start to hear your inner voices. And some people are so uncomfortable with hearing their inner voice that they need to distract themselves with other things. So you have to stop to be still. Be comfortable listening to your inner voice and you start to decide exactly whether you’re on a vehicle that’s getting you in the direction that you want to go. To the destination you have in mind. Let’s go to another lesson that we learn while at the airport. Now there’s a time, just before you get on the plane where you have to go through, uh, what they call the security check, right. And they tell you to remove all your belongs and put them on the tray or putting on the conveyor belt. And go through the belt there. Has there ever been a time when you watch somebody going through the belt – I’m not saying it was you. But you saw somebody go through and they’re – and once they went through the belt, after they had removed everything the alarm goes, beep, beep, beep, beep. Oh, wait a minute. What is it. Oh, I have a necklace. I forgot I had this on. And they had to take something off. You ever seen that happen. It took somebody outside of themselves to recognize it as they look through the monitor. Did you know that happens in life the same way. Some people are traveling and attempting to continue on their journey through life but they’re carrying some things with them that they’ve carried so long they forgot that they had it. But if they continue carrying it, it’s going to interfere possibly with their journey and transition through life. And it usually takes somebody outside of themselves to recognize and point it out to them. And say, you know, I’m – I’m noticing certain things about you. And – and you might want to check that. But here’s an interesting thing. Uh, we have something instinctive in us that’s designed for our survival. Uh, for instance, if uh – someone was to throw a chair or something at you, you wouldn’t have to have gone through a, uh, a yoga class or a martial arts training just to duck out of the way, would you. No. We call that instinct, don’t we. Instinctively we move out the way. Did you know the same thing happens in terms of things that are emotionally threatening to us. We tend to come up with devices, subconsciously that protects us from things that are coming at us. They call that denial. Simple denial is easy to identify. But some of the ones that’s – that’s a little more covert, I’m just going to mention a couple of them for the sake of time. Would be, uh, for instance, blaming. This will be an example of a person who’s going through their journey in life and someone sitting on the outside, a family member, a friend says, you know, I don’t know but kind of as I’m looking at you, it looks like you may have a – you – you might be carrying some anger with you right there. You might want to check that before you continue on your journey. It might interfere with things. And the person says, yes, you’re right, I do have a problem with anger. But it’s because of your mother why I act this way. See, they always find someone that they can blame for the reason that they’re doing what they’re doing. Now, what’s wrong with blaming. Well, what’s wrong with it, as long as you blame somebody else for what you’re doing, you don’t have to change, do you. You can keep doing things exactly as you are. Or what about the person who’s going through and a friend or family member looks and says, you know, I can see that you’re having a problem with, uh – with alcohol. It seems to be – you’re drinking quite a bit there. You might want to check that it might interfere with your journey And they say, yes. I do have a problem with alcohol. But I’m not as bad as, the man next door. And they always can find somebody who’s a little worse off then they are. So that they can continue doing what they’re doing. You see, this form of denial prevents them from seeing themselves as they are. Be conscious as you travel in your journey through life whether possibly you may be carrying some hurt, some anger, some things that you may need to work on setting aside. Or your clients may need to work on setting aside, before you can continue forward. So now we’ve made it. And we’ve gone so far as to get actually on the plane. And as you’re sitting there the flight attendant will make this announcement. And in case of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, mask will drop down. Please put on your oxygen mask when, first. Why do they say put your oxygen mask on first. Because you really can’t help other people if you haven’t first helped yourself. As clinicians, that’s especially important for you, isn’t it. You have to learn how to take care of yourself. The burnout rate is so high in the field of care taking. Some time the caretakers are the last ones to be cared for. Putting on your oxygen mask first. But, uh, since we’re talking about bringing it into terms of transitioning through our lives or helping our clients transition through their life, can we ask the question, what does your oxygen mask look like. For you. For your clients. Intellectually, where is your oxygen mask. If you need to talk with someone who’s going to be an inspiration for you to, uh, maybe you need to mastermind some things. Where is your oxygen mask. Who do you call. Who do you talk to if that’s the case. You need intellectual oxygen or support. Uh, what if you need spiritual support, oxygen. Where do you go if you’re trying to figure out how to handle a moral decision, whether something is morally right or wrong for you or for your client, where do you go. Where is your oxygen mask that will help you be able to breath and successfully manage through that transition that’s creating some difficulties for you. Physically, if you need physical support to do some things that you need to do. Maybe you need to lose, maybe you need to gain, maybe you need to strengthen, maybe you need to find more balance, physically. Who do you talk to to help you with that. You know, we left off one – left off a couple, actually. One of them is emotional. What about that. What if you’re going through something emotionally maybe with a spouse or, uh, with a family member. And you actually need to try to find some kind of way that – that you could possibly work with that. How – how do you do that. What – where is your emotional support if you need someone that you can talk to, to help you make it through those difficult times. What if you’re going through something right now. What if your client is going through something today, right now, no exception, at this very moment. And you don’t have anyone to talk to because we know we can’t tell everybody everything, right. So what do you do. There’s a book that’s called the Artist Way. And it suggests something that in some cases, and I don’t want you to take offense to this, but I want you to consider this as a possibility, as a tool that you could share with someone else, sometimes they say that writing it down is as powerful as talking to a therapist. Isn’t that something. Doesn’t mean that you necessarily have to journal about it. Doesn’t mean you have to write every day. But sometimes just writing down your feelings, your thoughts, you ideas, exactly as you feel them might be the very thing that can help you make it through a difficult period. Now what you do with the paper when you finish is completely up to you. You can – you can save it. You can – you can mail it off. You can make a paper airplane out of it. You can do whatever you need to do once you finish with it. But the point is, is that you can at least have relief. That’s putting on your oxygen mask. Now, using that same example, they often say that the bag will not inflate even though oxygen may be flowing through. Now how does that relate in our personal lives. You may not see the bag inflating but you’ll be getting oxygen through there. It’s – it’s true in this way in terms of our lives. You may not know that you have some of the support that you have right next to you. But it doesn’t mean it’s not right there. You may have support for almost everything that you’re going through. Whether you need assistance, financially. Whether you need help, uh, with something physically. Whether it’s an emotional need, whether it’s a spiritual need. You may have those sources right there even though you may not be aware of it. So we have to be – as children we have to be aggressive. We have to go after some of these things so that we can access the oxygen mask that we have, that’s there. The last piece that I want to give you about this is, just as you are about to get off the plane, there’s something that they say to you. They talk to you about gathering your belonging carefully because it’s possible that they may have shifted during the time of your travel. You remember hearing that at all when you’re on the plane. Well, as you travel through your journey through life you may have had to separate yourself from certain people, places and things. That mean certain people that you had to stop being around if you’re going to continue successfully on your journey. There may be certain places that you decided that you really can’t continue going because it would interfere with things. And certain things you couldn’t do. So when you go back to reconnect, you may discover that things look a little different. People, uh, act a little differently. Maybe you have changed because everything is always in a state of change. Some people are trying to get back to things being normal. And the reality is, we may have to look for what is called the new normal. So we can find our balance again. And be able to successfully journey through life. The intention is to have you find one element, one area of the things that we discovered when we were traveling through the airport as an example of helping a person, including ourselves, manage our transitions through life. And then being that student of life, you will learn that there are lessons all around, just to help us be strong. And everybody that we meet has become teachers to that very same end. Well, it looks like we’ve come to, uh, our destination. We’ve arrived safely at our location. So what I’d like to ask you to do is be careful as you’re gathering you belongings, as you prepare to leave. Because it’s possible that your mind may have shifted during this discussion. Travel well and I look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you.

SHANNON DERMER  Mr. Gentry, thank you. 

00:19:35
MARCUS GENTRY Thank you. 

00:19:35
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:19:35
SHANNON DERMER I always enjoy good metaphors and analogies. So I really enjoyed you talking about the lessons we can learn from the airport. 

00:19:40
MARCUS GENTRY Yeah. 

00:19:45
SHANNON DERMER I like that. How’d you come up with that idea? 

00:19:45
MARCUS GENTRY Being in the airport. 

00:19:45
SHANNON DERMER Just – you spend a lot of time there. 

00:19:45
Marcus Gentry 

00:19:45
MARCUS GENTRY Yes, yes. Being – being in the airport and looking for, uh, creative ways. One – one of the things I, um, I do – I don’t always have the luxury of longevity when I’m speaking to audiences. And so I try to create systems that allow them to get the message, the quickest last the longest and sink the deepest. And I do attachment. So I try to attach it to something they’re already familiarly with. Something that they already know. So when they see that again, it – the new information attaches to the old. It lasts a little longer with them sometimes. 

00:20:20
SHANNON DERMER No, that’s great. I think that is one of the great things about using analogies and metaphors. And then, uh, the field of education they called it scaffolding. Which is connecting it to something that people already know that that’s a way to get learning done. 

00:20:35
MARCUS GENTRY Yeah. 

00:20:35
SHANNON DERMER Efficiently. So I – I really enjoyed it. And I also learned, um, something quite new. I never knew you could, uh, get anything from going through the security line except for how to learn to smile and, uh, look comfortable when someone’s touching you with latex gloves that you don’t’ want to touch you. 

00:20:50
MARCUS GENTRY Yeah, yeah. 

00:20:50
SHANNON DERMER I didn’t – but you did teach me that there are other lessons that we can learn -- 

00:20:50
MARCUS GENTRY Yes there are. 

00:20:55
SHANNON DERMER -- from TSA. 

00:20:55
MARCUS GENTRY Yeah. 

00:20:55
SHANNON DERMER And from the security line. 

00:20:55
MARCUS GENTRY Yes, there are. Yes. 

00:21:00
SHANNON DERMER And actually I think you were saying that – and, you know, sometimes we get so used to certain things that we can’t recognize it’s there until an alarm goes off or someone tells us. And I think that is the role a lot of times of counselors or therapists. 

00:21:10
MARCUS GENTRY That – that is exactly what it is. Um, I call it sometimes trying to clear the mirror off so that they can see themselves. And – and you’re absolutely right. The example of going through, um, the security is just a – a glaringly clear message that it takes somebody outside of us to see certain things that we have carried so long we’re not even aware of it. We have adapted. Uh, we’ve surround ourselves with a constituency that may not be bringing it to our attention all the time to – it takes somebody outside to – to bring that. But we have to be receptive. Um, when I speak a little longer about, uh, communication skills, talking and listening, this is the part where I deal with the importance of being able to listen, um, as I say listen without defending. Try to speak without offending and listen without defending. So if they can listen to some of the things that others are – are sharing with them, then it’s possible that it could help them in their journey through life as they transition to different phases. 

00:22:10
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:22:10
SHANNON DERMER That’s really interesting that you said that. I think, you know, um, as you know, I supervise counselors in training. And, uh, I think that’s a very succinct, powerful way to say it, to listen without defending or offending. Um, I think it’s our job sometimes to challenge people that’s -- 

00:22:25
MARCUS GENTRY Sure. 

00:22:25
SHANNON DERMER -- not the same thing as offending them. 

00:22:30
MARCUS GENTRY Exactly. 

00:22:30
SHANNON DERMER And I think that some times as clinicians we let some of our own stuff get in the way. And – and we get defensive even when we’re trying to help others. 

00:22:40
MARCUS GENTRY Yes. Yes. 

00:22:40
SHANNON DERMER So I like that. 

00:22:40
Marcus Gentry 

00:22:40
MARCUS GENTRY Yeah. Uh, I think we have to clear our own lenses. Um, when – when I’m speaking to large audiences I tell them that even though I maybe giving one, uh, seminar, or lesson or one briefing, um, it will be received hundreds of different ways based on the number of people in the audience and where they are in their life, in their journey. Um, how they preceive themselves, um, whether they feel it’s something relevant. How they perceive me. Uh, how they perceive the content of the information. All based on thier lenses. And then them giving it out to others is different. So I always try to encourage them – that’s why I encourage in all of my sessions to take this and then put it in your language, even if it’s one piece and give it to someone else. It’ll become extremely powerful for that person. Because that person can’t hear it possibly the way I would present it. But the way they would present it, through their lenses, and based on their experiences and everything it’ll make it a little bit different. 

00:23:40
SHANNON DERMER All right. Good. I also enjoyed, um, when you were talking about putting your own mask on first. 

00:23:45
MARCUS GENTRY Yes. Yes. 

00:23:50
SHANNON DERMER And I think in the helping fields, especially in, like the 70s and, you know, 60s and, uh, well even into like the 80s with marriage and counter groups and things like that. There was a misperception of that at times. That it was supposed to be – you’re supposed to be selfish. That’s not what you were talking about. You were talking about take care of yourself in some ways because then you’re able to do what you need to do with and for others. Not that you just focus in on yourself. But sometimes you had to take care of yourself first. 

00:24:15
MARCUS GENTRY The – well that is 100 percent correct. And – and all the information that I share is not, um, just for the sake of giving out information. It’s very real. All of it’s very really and very passionate about it all. Because my father, um, in caring for my mother, um, who had Alzheimer, uh, was not able to continue to take care of himself. He ended up being put on hospice care because of not caring for himself. And only later was he able to be taken off of that. See he didn’t think it was fair for him to take of himself and – and not my mother. So it’s a whole adjustment in thinking that comes with that. 

00:24:55
SHANNON DERMER Well, and it’s paradoxical. Sometimes – like you just mentioned, he couldn’t take care of your mother, his wife, at one point because he hadn’t take care of himself. 

00:25:00
MARCUS GENTRY Exactly. 

00:25:00
SHANNON DERMER So sometimes we think, oh I have to focus in on the other, but by doing some for yourself you actually are able to help others better. 

00:25:10
MARCUS GENTRY Stephen Cubby calls it sharpening the saw in the seventh of the seven habits of highly effective people. We have to be able to sharpen our saw and he tells the story of the man cutting down the tree. And then he said, well maybe if you sharpen your saw, he said I don’t have time to sharpen. I got to cut the tree down. But we – we have to be able to give ourselves permission, again, to, uh, sharpen our own saw. So we can be more effective doing what – what has to be done with others. 

00:25:35
SHANNON DERMER Right. And I know you also work with the military -- 

00:25:35
MARCUS GENTRY Yeah. 

00:25:35
SHANNON DERMER -- and they talk about taking some R and R, some rest and relaxation. So the – you actually can be better. 

00:25:40
MARCUS GENTRY That’s right. 

00:25:40
SHANNON DERMER Yeah, taking time out for yourself actually does make it so that you can help people better, efficiently, more effectively. 

00:25:50
MARCUS GENTRY It – it does. And – and again, this – this has to do with being able to, be a strategist. And step back far enough to realize the long term goal is, you – you want to be able to care for yourself and those who are important in your life. And how can you best do that without oxygen. 

00:26:05
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. You can’t. 

00:26:10
MARCUS GENTRY Right. 

00:26:10
SHANNON DERMER Um, we only have a little bit of time left. But I want to ask you, we just have a few minutes. I want to ask you of the lessons that you learned from an airport, which is your favorite one to talk about. 

00:26:20
MARCUS GENTRY They’re – they’re all very – a passion of mine. One of my favorites is one that I didn’t talk about. 

00:26:25
SHANNON DERMER Oh. 

00:26:25
MARCUS GENTRY Which is, um, checking your excess baggage. Checking your excess baggage is one of my favorite ones. Because, uh, that’s where I talk about putting aside the people, places and things that you have been with for so long. They’re still connected to you. These are still people that you love and enjoy. These are still things you like to do. They’re still places that you like to go. But if you continue carrying them with you, it’ll be difficult for you to successfully make it to the next phase of your journey trying to carry those things. So you have to be able to set them to the side long enough for you to continue on your journey through life. So that’s where I start to deal with the first level of communication. How do you communicate to people important in your life that you need to do something a little different now, in order for you to continue forward. And maintain a healthy relationship. 

00:27:15
SHANNON DERMER Well, some people like to try and take that and carry on. They had the big bags -- 

00:27:20
MARCUS GENTRY Yes, they do. 

00:27:20
SHANNON DERMER And they say, no you can’t -- 

00:27:20
MARCUS GENTRY And I – I actually talk about that. That’s one – there’s actually a total of 12 different lessons. 

00:27:25
SHANNON DERMER Oh. 

00:27:25
MARCUS GENTRY So we really abbreviated them for our time.

SHANNON DERMER We abbreviated – see the – you thought those were like the seven most, uh, important or the – the ones that needed to be talked about.

Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:27:35
MARCUS GENTRY Those – those were some of the ones that I want – I – I could have pulled any three. But those are there that I think are – yes, absolutely important. 

00:27:40
SHANNON DERMER Good. Okay, we only have like, two minutes. Without going into big explanation about what they were, what were the other ones that you – we didn’t have time to go over. Do you -- 

00:27:50
MARCUS GENTRY Oh my. Uh, the other ones had to not – uh, do with not picking up unknown baggage. Uh -- 

00:27:55
SHANNON DERMER You can get in trouble for that. 

00:27:55
Marcus Gentry 

00:27:55
MARCUS GENTRY Yes. You’re carrying on – right. Carrying unknown baggage. So I talk about how people are carrying things that were given to them a long time ago. Messages, beliefs, rules, restrictions about life. Uh, I talk about paying attention when you get to your gate. So that you can know, um, how to, um, change if things change. You may start it on one course and things all of the sudden change. And you need to follow a different pattern. But you can’t do that if you’re sleeping. So you have to stay alert and aware. I talk about putting on your seatbelt. I talk about the difference between, um, riding in first class and riding in coach. I talk about the exit rows. 

00:28:30
SHANNON DERMER Oh wow, you do have a lot more. I have to cut you off. But I do have to say, I enjoy first class. Not that I ever can afford it. Usually I get, like, bumped up there or, uh, it’s because I, uh, you know, volunteer to get off the previous plane. But I want to thank all of you today for joining me and Mr. Gentry. And learning all about lessons from the airport. I’m going to have to pay more attention next time I’m in the airport. Please check out the Alexander Street Press website when you get a chance for more from Mr. Gentry. And from some of our other Therapy Talks. Thank you for joining us. And thank you. 

00:29:00
MARCUS GENTRY Thank you very much.
