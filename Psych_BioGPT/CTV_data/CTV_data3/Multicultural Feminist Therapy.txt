MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Hi my name is Matt Englar-Carlson, and I'm the host of the Counseling Theories in Action video series. Theory is the compass that allows counselors to navigate the vast territory of clinical practice. In the same ways the navigational tools have been modified to adapt to advances in thinking and ever expanding territories to explore. Theories of counseling have changed over time to integrate advances in science, to adapt to the broad range of presenting concerns, and most importantly, to be more inclusive of full range of cultural identities that our clients embody. We do know that counselors adopt and practice according to one theory over another because their experience and decades of good evidence suggests that having a sound theory of counseling leads to greater therapeutic success. A sound theory helps the client and counselor makes sense of a client's experiences and their presenting concern. Theory also guides actions towards successful outcomes while generating hope and both the counselor and client that recovery is possible. There are many different counseling theories and that wide variety is a testament to the different ways in which the same human behavior can be conceptualized. But also the different ways that counseling can be practiced, this video series presents different theoretical approaches to counseling with the emphasis on different theoretical based interventions. The viewer will get a chance to see how professionals make sense of their chosen theoretical model and also then observe that model in action.

An Introduction to Multicultural Feminist Theory 

00:01:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Hi Olga. 

00:01:45
OLGA L. MEJÍA Hi. 

00:01:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON In this video you're gonna have a chance to show six interventions from a multicultural feminist perspective. Before we get to watch those interventions, why don't we can learn a bit more about you and kind of why this approach (inaudible)? 

00:01:55
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yes. 

00:02:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So what does multicultural feminists counseling mean to you? 

00:02:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. So I'll talk to you about what it means to me, right. I think that being multicultural or identifying as a multicultural feminists means different things to different people. Umm… I think that, umm… in the work that I do, I've just really learned and from my experience that culture and context really matters. And so that at the heart… I believe that the heart of our experiences and how we interact with our world, with our environment, culture matters. And umm… I'll… I'll also say that I define culture broadly. So that to me it includes race, ethnicity, uh… socioeconomic status, uh… effectual slash, sexual orientation, gender, uh… religion, so kinda broadly ability uh… all of that and so that's kind of a lot of the heart of how I kind of live out multicultural feminism if you will. And then I think within that what I'll add is that really what I think matters a lot it's the intersections of those. Right. That people aren't just, umm… you know, they're not just a woman, they're not just Mexican. They're just not… it's… They're all of that at the same time. 

00:03:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So it's a… it's an approach that kind of focuses on the intersectionality of identity within a context in which it occurs. 

00:03:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA Exactly. That's exactly right. 

00:03:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And how did you become interested in this approach in terms of your background and your training? 

00:03:45
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. Umm… You know, how did I get interested in this approach? I think umm… it's both kind of umm… academic reasons and personal reasons. 

00:03:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So who you are. 

00:04:00
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. Kind of who I am. Kind of the… the mix of both that I think that… umm… academically, I just kind of drawn to that, you know, to both to kind of multicultural perspective and then having a true focus on looking at gender and how… And yes, a lot of that is based on… on who I am and how I navigate the worlds and how… And I… What I've learned from my life experiences. 

00:04:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, we've… with other kinds of theories and theoreticians often, you know, the theory that comes out, as a theory that helps most explain their life, or the one that kind of fits their life best and sounds like (inaudible) makes sense as well. 

00:04:40
OLGA L. MEJÍA Right. Right. I think yeah. I… I was originally born in Mexico and so I… I'm an immigrant. I identify as an immigrant. I came here as a young child, I was nine and so most of my life has been here and certainly my education, umm… my higher education has been in the US. And yeah, those early years have been… are very formative and really impact. Umm… You know, in many ways I navigated this world as in… in the US as another, right. And so I'm really aware of kind of the environment and how it impacts us, so yeah I think in a lot of ways I kinda for my own personal experiences that that's once I started umm… it kind of higher education that helped explain a lot of my experiences as well as people around me. 

00:05:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. And just knowing you a bit, I also know that inclusive is really… really important to who you are, but I also know that there's this activist part of you as well that is not just enough to be inclusive but there's an activist component in which one in kind of reach out and be proactive with people. 

00:06:00
OLGA L. MEJÍA Absolutely. I think that as I've gone through different experiences in my life, umm… that as I tried to make sense of it, umm… both in terms at home and at school kind of in… in my education. Yeah. There was a certain sense of umm… lots of feelings that would come up but one of them was around, you know, feeling like there's injustice or feeling angry and umm… like that… or confused, like that doesn't make sense. And so I wanted to do something about that, and so I think my… I have kind of a collectivistic. 

00:06:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:06:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA Uh… I think that comes from my culture and perhaps also my gender, umm… but then there is this sense of… let's do something about that though. 

00:06:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:06:45
OLGA L. MEJÍA Right. That let's… let's… As I think as a feminist really questioning umm… kind of power and how it gets uh… distributed or not, you know, and how people are impacted by those systems, kind of power systems. 

00:07:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:07:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA Umm… That I think, yeah, it's really pushed me to do something about it or get to know about the systems or to question the systems. Yeah. 

00:07:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So as a counselor working from a feminist perspective. What do you assessing and looking for in your clients? 

00:07:25
OLGA L. MEJÍA Umm… You know, umm… in working with and… and teaching, right. I think a lot of what I tell my students. I say, you know, there's the theory and then there's the practice, right. And so I think that overall in working with clients say , I'm… what assessing is… I'm looking at relationships. You know, I'm looking at what's causing them distress, you know, how are they making sense of that distress, you know, what have… I already… what have they already tried and how can I help them. So I think that kind of my clinical sense, that's kind of what I'm assessing, you know, where… what's their level of motivation kind of coming in. Umm… There's all the clinical stuff I'm looking at. Umm… I think from a multicultural feminist perspective, though I am, you know, at some point, umm… I'm looking at, umm… how do they make sense of the intersections of their life. How do I identify, are they… Sometimes clients aren't quite aware, you know, their culture or their gender or that how… I'm… how much distress that's causing them. And so at some point I want to help them, if that seems like that's where they're at, to… to see that, uh… and to have better understanding of themselves. 

00:08:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So sounds like part of that… that assessment is like a multicultural assessment because understand the contexts in which they live, the identities which they embody even though the client may not necessarily maybe have… have a full awareness. It's… it's bringing that into the clinical setting and you're kinda have a conversation about that. 

00:09:10
OLGA L. MEJÍA Absolutely. And… and I actually think quite often there are difficult conversations to bring into the therapy room. I think that often those conversations haven't been part of umm… talking about feelings and thoughts and behaviors, umm… and so talking about race or talking about gender or ethnicity hasn't always been welcomed. Hasn't always been a part of the work that we do and so at some point, I do think and I think this is kind of the both a multicultural and feminist part that the role that I have as a counselor is that I want to bring those conversations or… or I guess I'll say, I'm the way to say it is I'll welcome those conversations, or introduce those conversations. Sure. You know, that the client that that's not where they might be. 

00:10:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:10:00
OLGA L. MEJÍA That's okay. 

00:10:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

00:10:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA You know, umm… but that may be I've at least introduced that topic, umm… and created some space for that conversation to happen and if it doesn't happen or if it happens later, that's okay. But at least I welcomed, umm… or opened up that space if you will. 

00:10:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So there's some space, and there's like an awareness, it sounds like in which maybe client expects to talk about feelings or behaviors or thoughts, you know, and you're also saying like, Oh, in context. Right. 

00:10:30
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yes. 

00:10:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And… and culture and that, those are actually connected. 

00:10:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA That they're actually connected. 

00:10:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:10:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA Right. That the distress that someone is experiencing at some point has something to do with where they come from. 

00:10:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

00:10:40
OLGA L. MEJÍA And you're right in saying that that may not be a conversation that is normally had. Right. And so maybe counseling can be a place to have a safe conversation around that. 

00:10:50
OLGA L. MEJÍA Right. 

00:10:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:10:50
OLGA L. MEJÍA And I would say that that's true for all clients. In my experience, that's particularly true for some people of color that come into counseling, that perhaps because I think counseling can be stigmatized in all cultures but there's something about under-represented groups when they seek counseling that they're tends to be like, what are we supposed to do here, and, you know, how is this supposed to help me. You know that, maybe I'm already breaking the rules by coming to counseling within my family. And so, in some ways, I really want to invite the conversations that may be the client, umm… might not expect to have into the room. And… and that's the goal is to help them feel like you do belong here and that this can be a safe space for you. 

00:11:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. Right. And here so that think about the idea that… that we think about clients at the kind of cross to come over to us as a service provider right. And the reality is… is that you know maybe we need to cross over to kinda go over the clients are, making more appropriate for what feels good for them. 

00:12:00
OLGA L. MEJÍA Absolutely, right. That it's, you know, the idea of meeting the client where they're at as opposed to the client meeting me where I'm not. 

00:12:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Which usually, probably therapy is… is practiced historically. 

00:12:10
OLGA L. MEJÍA Historically, kinda a traditional. 

00:12:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:12:15
OLGA L. MEJÍA Right. And so I really want to work at welcoming conversations that haven't often been welcomed and then trying to equalize some of the… I think there are some inherent, you know, within the counselor, there are some inherent power, power differential that's gonna happen, and… and so owning that, understanding that, but also trying to even that out as much as possible with the client. 

00:12:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is there a ideal client for this approach or in contrast, is there one for this is not a good approach for? 

00:12:45
OLGA L. MEJÍA Umm… I think that's another question where I kinda go. There's the theory and there's the practice, you know, that I think kind of overall I feel like, therapy overall is… will be helpful. So there's a (inaudible) couldn't be helpful for a client who has some level of motivation to change. 

00:13:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:13:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA You know and that they're having some distress and it's causing some stress in their life that they're… Excuse me… That they're wanting a change. Umm… And so I think that, you know, regardless of the issue that the client might be presenting with. I think that this approach can be helpful if the client is motivated. And then I think for a client that it might not be helpful is if the client at that moment truly isn't wanting to make change in their life. 

00:13:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I'm thinking about (inaudible) say that is this notion that this approach really focuses on context, right… and… and though enabling other contexts. Right. Everyone has a culture, everyone has an identity, everyone has an intersectional identities even though they may not be aware of… Right. Right. And so I think, you know, even like this approach, I wonder… Well, we put feminist and their people often think, oh, that's just most people… women… 

00:14:00
OLGA L. MEJÍA Uh-huh. 

00:14:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Uh… But my hunch is that this could work for men as well. 

00:14:10
OLGA L. MEJÍA Absolutely. Yeah. I very much take that approach and, you know, as I do… as I do teaching but also as… as I do clinical work with clients, it's about… in some ways clarifying, you know, to mystifying that myth, you know, somehow being a feminist counselor means that I only work with women. And I actually in some ways, uh… feel strongly that. In order to work around, umm… kind of feminist issues, actually both gender or even more genders, there's uh… you know, kind of across the genders that we all need to work on these issues because actually they impact all of us. However, we identify it. 

00:14:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. So if counseling is effective from this perspective, what do you expect to see happen? 

00:15:00
OLGA L. MEJÍA Umm… You know, I think that a lot. For one is that the client feels helped. You know, that they feel like I heard them, that I understood them, so that they feel seen, that they feel heard, they feel understood… 

00:15:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Which is (inaudible). I mean, I think sometimes we rush. There's other kind of thing but I think what you're saying is that a core level, the client feels like you understood them. You're… you've validated their experience. 

00:15:30
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. That they were rather than feeling coming in and… "Oh yeah, that wasn't really a problem," that they felt like, "Oh wait, no that was the problem." Right. We could kind of talk about it and deconstruct it and examine the different parts of it and… and that they felt heard and seen. 

00:15:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:15:45
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. I think within that… that, you know, in working from multicultural feminist perspective that they're having a greater understanding of themselves, and they're having a greater understanding of their context. Right. I think as their understanding themselves that they're understanding the different parts of their identity. Right. And… and the ways that they might identify as, you know, their race with their gender, with their ethnicity, you know, that they're having greater understanding of that. Umm… I think also, hopefully, my thesis and effective way to… to work with a client that they are umm… knowing what they're good at. You know, that there is a sense of strength. There is a sense of competency. You know, that umm… we all have, you know, and problems in life and difficulties and struggles but that there is a sense of… I can either reach out for help or I can get through this. 

00:16:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:16:50
OLGA L. MEJÍA Uh… So a sense of strength about themselves. 

00:16:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So there's a bit around kind of… kind of being seen, heard, validated deeper awareness in terms of kind of maybe who they are, across the board, across the what… what identities and then is empowerment piece around identifying strengths and… and having again empowerment that… that… there's things like they can do. 

00:17:10
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yes. That it's not something that passively happens to them or happens to us is that there is an agency that they can have around their difficulties. 

00:17:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So Olga I know that you're also a professor and you teach this. And so when you teach this approach to students, what do you want them to understand? What do you think they need to get? 

00:17:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA So as I'm teaching about this approach, I umm… You know, that it needs to fit for them. Right. I think regardless of however or whatever approach uh… trainee or student chooses to use is that it needs to fit for them, you know, based on their academics and their academic experience, their educational experience, based on their personal experiences that it needs to fit for them because when they're sitting across a client, they need to access this information easily. So it needs to be accessible and needs to make sense. So yeah, I think that… I would say that that's important. Umm… I also would say, you know, one of the things I always recommend to… to students is that they need to do their own work. 

00:18:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:18:30
OLGA L. MEJÍA You know, so and… and teaching about these theories about these, you know, all the different theories from the say, multicultural feminist approach, is the client that the… Sorry, umm… the trainee the student needs to know themselves. Okay. Right. Because the… the student needs to understand their context, needs to understand their identities and how they intersect and how they impact and how power and privilege impacts me and… and in what ways to I have power and in what ways do I have privilege, and what ways don't I have power and what ways don't I have privilege. Umm… So that once they can know themselves better, they'll be able to help the client that's sitting across from them, to do that as well. 

00:19:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sounds like, you know, in order to kind of work in a perspective, a student has to kind of have done their own cultural work do. 

00:19:20
OLGA L. MEJÍA Absolutely. 

00:19:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. It seems that kinda maybe who they are but also contextually spaces they… they are in and kinda how their identities kinda impact back and forth. And you mentioned power as a major component to understand the kind of power analysis or power dynamics. 

00:19:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA Absolutely. Right. That… that's part of kind of… I think for both multiculturalism and feminists, those are kind of power and how… again… again it's distributed or not distributed. Right. Umm… I think that has huge implications for both approaches. 

00:19:50
Introduction to Client 

00:19:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So in a moment we're gonna get chance to see you work with… with Jackie and you get to show six interventions. I want you to give us (inaudible) an introduction to Jackie and what brings her in. 

00:20:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA Sure. Sure. Yeah. I'll be working with Jackie, so Jackie is in her late 20s and she is coming in… She's self-identifies as Mexican-American, and she's coming in primarily because she's struggling with her identities, kind of her various identities, particularly around ethnicity. You know, and umm… so, you know, does she identify more as Mexican or does she identify more as American or kind of a balance of the two. 

00:20:40
SKILL NUMBER ONE: 

00:20:40
Culturally Sensitive Engagement 

00:20:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Skill number one culturally sensitive engagement. So what do you mean by culturally sensitive engagement? 

00:20:50
OLGA L. MEJÍA You know, I think that all of the different phases of treatment are important but I need to get the client to come in and stay in, and so in that way engagement is the most important in that first session and so umm… and then, particularly I think with all clients period, uh… but if I'm working with a person of color, umm… I feel like a lot has already taken place for them to come in to see me. And so I worked really hard at umm… engaging, and then I try to have a sense of their culture, you know, how do we… how do they identify. And so I want to as much as I know about the culture, umm… and if I don't know, then I'll ask. Umm… But I want to really try to make use of the knowledge that I have to engage with the client so that they feel seen, they feel heard, they feel understood, umm… and so I want to make use of as much as I have available to me to… to engage with them. 

00:22:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So there's… there's like… there's engagement that we normally talk about but you're also kind of putting this real focus on… on culture and also… also insensitive to the client's experience what… what they might expect. 

00:22:10
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yes. Exactly. That if I need to provide psycho-education, I wanna meet them where they're at. 

00:22:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So in just a moment we're gonna see this in action. What… what should we be looking for in this quote? 

00:22:20
OLGA L. MEJÍA Umm… Look to see if I did any of that, you know, I think for sure, you know, and the ways that I just do engagement overall uh… with the client. Umm… I'll be working with a client that identifies as Mexican-American and so look to see if I made use of some kind of culture… kind of her cultural backgrounds and umm… helping to engage with her. 

00:22:45
[sil.] 

00:22:50
OLGA L. MEJÍA Hi Jackie. 

00:22:50
JACKIE Hi. 

00:22:50
OLGA L. MEJÍA It's good to see you. Umm… So today as we get started, I wanna get to know a little bit about you and what brings you in today. So umm… if you can let me know, uh… I get to… to know you, umm… what brings you in? 

00:23:15
JACKIE Well, I really want to talk about umm… I guess some inertia was that I'm having with… with I guess identity and… and my culture, and… and how I fit in or I not fit in, not only in my Mexican culture but being born in the United States and coming from… or having parents who are immigrants and umm… how those kind of like conflict with one another. It's like a struggle to try to find balance between those two. Umm… So yeah that's… that's what I am here, I guess. 

00:23:55
OLGA L. MEJÍA Okay. Sure. Yeah. So umm… I definitely hear that you're really thinking about, umm… maybe identity or maybe different identities and that there's a real sense of struggle around, umm… perhaps how you're developing, umm… and then also kind of your family or your parents history, is that? 

00:24:20
JACKIE Yes. I think while growing up Mexican. Well, my first language was Spanish, umm… you know, considering I was born here, obviously my parents spoke Spanish and that's what we speak at home. Umm… So that's all I knew when I was little before going into school, and up until third grade, I was in bilingual classes. So a lot of people just like me and then as I got older I was exposed to different ideas and different views, so umm… so I guess more Western ways of thinking, so being independent, umm… you know, achieving things for yourself and it's not necessarily like the family achievement. And… and yeah, I saw it in the family achievement, you know, so there's… I… I was exposed to so many different things that uh… when I started college, I was confused and was exposed to even more, so I started questioning a lot of things and that didn't fit really well with my family, especially my mom. So that's been difficult to manage. 

00:25:45
OLGA L. MEJÍA Okay. So hearing a few things, I'm hearing… I definitely hear the struggle, right and umm… for you, kind of individually balancing, umm… kind of your development and what I also hear is in comparison to family, right, that there is kind of maybe more individualistic, umm… and more collectivistic points of view. Umm… I hear the struggle and trying to balance different cultures, and having… Although it sounds like you're born here, so you're a second-generation. It seems like your parents are first-generation. 

00:26:25
JACKIE Yes, first-generation. Umm… My mom came here, I think when she was 17, and my dad, I think around the same age. They met here. 

00:26:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA Okay. 

00:26:40
JACKIE And so… so yeah. So first… they're… they're first generation, we were second generation. 

00:26:50
OLGA L. MEJÍA And so they probably came here and had to learn the language as well. Even though you also learned the language, even though you were born, umm… as second generation. They're first generation, you're second generation, you still had to struggle with learning the language. And later on struggle with, to identify more as Mexican or more as American. Umm… And then I hear that there is umm… perhaps some… some of that conflict or tension gets caught up between yourself and your mom. Is that? 

00:27:25
JACKIE Yeah. And I think too, umm… because Spanish was my first language, umm… as I learned English. I felt like I had an accent too and… and so I worked really hard to try to eliminate that, so there was point in our… even I felt ashamed because of being Mexican or… or knowing Spanish or, you know, so… And then, so we would go to Mexico a lot during the summer to… to visit family… my mom's and my dad's family, and we would be called (inaudible), you know, so it's like… Well, am I Mexican or am I American. So there was always that… I guess unconsciously there was always that question like, what am I. You know, I'm… Here, I'm not American enough and there I'm not Mexican enough so that struggle and then as I grew older having my own values or the way I… I thought about stuff or religion being catholic and going to church every Sunday I think that was the biggest struggle with my mom, you know. "Why aren't you going to church?" You know… 

00:28:45
OLGA L. MEJÍA Because she wanted you to go to church. 

00:28:45
JACKIE School has changed, you know, so as… you know, I was getting my bachelors, it will that like, "School had changed, why are you letting that change you?" That's the only we taught you, so that was hard to hear too. 

00:29:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA So quite often, I… you're expressing some pretty strong feelings, right, that it brings up some pretty umm… strong reactions from you, and… and I can understand how it would. Umm… That it seems like, umm… you know, that you don't fit in when you went to Mexico but then also feeling that you don't fit when you're in the US. Umm… Because of feeling like you had an accent or feeling shame about your Mexican culture. That's pretty strong. I'm curious what it's like to talk with me about that right now? 

00:29:45
JACKIE A part of me, umm… I guess feel shame to… to just talk about how I was ashamed or, in some ways felt ashamed of being Mexican, umm… because I also really love the culture, and it's a huge part of me. Umm… And then, I… I guess… with talking about my mom too, you know, it all that's kind of disrespectful too. 

00:30:15
OLGA L. MEJÍA That's what it feels like. 

00:30:20
JACKIE That respect… I'm violating that I guess, I don't know. Yeah. 

00:30:25
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. I think that you bring up some really good points and I think umm… One of the things I want to do as we get to know each other, umm… is like, you know, umm… that I am understanding a lot of what you're saying. I… I think that there tends to be a lot of tension, you know, and the work that I've done with, uh… with different clients, right, that actually this is umm… I know it doesn't feel good for you. Umm… And at the same time, it's a common conflict that often happens for individuals and with the families who are immigrants. So and that there is a lot of umm… strong emotions that come up, like shame or embarrassment or umm… but I also hear proud, right, that it's something that you can be proud of your culture and that sometimes, this difference in between, umm… kind of yourself and your mom, for example, you know kind of children and umm… and parents, umm… happens quite often actually. Umm… And so I think that… In our work together that's something that we can talk about, umm… I think part of our work can also be to know that, you know, there's the individual level. You know, there's your family level, but also the culture actually and society tells us a lot about… messages about what language we should speak, or how we should look, or how we should sound, umm… you know and so, I think that sometimes, umm… taking those messages into account will be important, you know, because sometimes we internalize those messages, but really those messages are outside of us. Umm… And we take them in as if they were part of us. Umm… And so I think for now because you're just getting to know me, you know, I appreciate that you're umm… willing to… to talk with me about these topics that are difficult to… Umm… I'm wondering as we're getting started, if you have any questions for me, you know, about… about counseling and kind of what we're supposed to do here or anything else that comes up for you? 

00:32:45
JACKIE Well, I guess… My first question is do you understand Spanish? 

00:32:45
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. It's a good question. Yes. So… 

00:32:50
[non-English narration] 

00:32:55
OLGA L. MEJÍA So I do… I do. And what else, say, I'm really glad you asked that. That as we get to work together, umm… I really will go off… Umm… I'll let you know that Spanish is my first language, umm… and so that umm… whatever feels comfortable for you. However, you'd like to communicate, umm… as for getting to… to know each other. I'm open to that if we prefer to speak more in English or in Spanish or a blend of the two. I'm okay with that. 

00:33:25
JACKIE Sounds good. 

00:33:30
OLGA L. MEJÍA Any other questions for now? 

00:33:30
JACKIE No, I don't think so. 

00:33:30
OLGA L. MEJÍA Okay. 

00:33:35
[sil.] 

00:33:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So Olga, is this a good example of cultural sense of engagement? 

00:33:45
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yes. I feel like it is. I feel like, I worked umm… hard to kinda help her feel comfortable. You know, more than anything, I am building rapport, I'm building trust. You know, I'm a stranger to her and so in some… in what ways can I help her feel like this is a space for you. Umm… I think I… I was working on all of those things. I also, you know, umm… from what I know about uh… Mexican and Mexican-American culture. I wanted to make use of that. I… I… I don't want to assume that the way that I know Mexican culture, it's the way that she knows it, right. So it's almost like I know but then I suspend by knowing. 

00:34:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Right. Right. 

00:34:30
OLGA L. MEJÍA And so I… 

00:34:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON To see if it fits just kinda… 

00:34:30
OLGA L. MEJÍA To see if it fits for her and so I was guessing that she then umm… personally (inaudible) kinda this focus on the relationship was important and so I wanted to try that and kind of getting to know her more personally that I felt like that was important. I may be also guess that family might be important, so I wanted to ask about family as well. Umm… Maybe language at some point might come up, and so I wanted to… to make use of… out of… all of those. Now I think the other part of what I was trying to do was, umm… really trying to equalize umm… you know, as much as I… I can then (inaudible) for all that I have, you know, I know that I have that role as a counselor. Uh… But also that I want to try to equalize some of the… the power and the… the power differential and so towards the end, I… I did ask if she had any questions for me. And so that was a way to try to… to equalize them. 

00:35:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. I notice one point too umm… after Jackie had spoken a bit, you asked her how this felt about… gonna have this conversation that she mentioned that… she felt ashamed for maybe talking about culture, you know, and then also talking about her… her… her mom, in particular her mother. Right. Umm… I understood you really looked to validate her experience around that. 

00:36:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. So I mean I think a lot of the ways that I work umm… in the room is, you know, I'm paying attention to the relationship, you know, and to process. You know, how… how is the client taking in this information and my… and my hearing her, and you know, umm… and my understanding her. And so I'm also being aware when she was talking about shame and about culture and then talking about her mom. I'm… I'm having… I'm being aware that family tends to be important within a lot next culture, right. And… and so, you know, and because there tends to be a lot of stigma behind seeking counseling, I… I wanted to address that I wanted to give that experience of voice. 

00:36:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. To use the term respectful at one point and I thought… and then I saw you kinda really worked with her on that, that kinda know that maybe this conversation was a tough conversation. 

00:37:00
OLGA L. MEJÍA Right. Right. I respect those… a huge respect, right. It's kind of umm… I again, like I think across different cultures, right, but I think in the way that it shows up in Mexican culture, that, you know, the kinda parents are… You know, there's deference to parents, and to anyone who is really in an authority figure. And so when she kinda talked about mom and then feeling shamed, you know, I was aware of that and so I want to be sensitive. I want to be responsive to that, and so I wanted to kind of ticket with her, what is it like to be talking to me and to be talking to me about these issues, and to try to normalize and to try to welcome that conversation into the room. 

00:37:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Skill number two, language as an intervention. So what does language as an intervention? 

00:37:55
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah, so umm… this… I think this is really interesting. I… And the ways that I do counseling and then the ways that I do teaching, I've really been getting into language a lot so that language is the obvious way that we use language to communicate. 

00:38:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

00:38:10
OLGA L. MEJÍA Right. I think that so we're using language in that way in… in counseling. Umm… The way that I've started to use language is as an intervention. So if I'm working with a client that Spanish-speaking or that they're bilingual, right, that they use both is umm… depending on what we're talking about umm… that at times that actually might help them to speak of that experience either in Spanish or in English, sometimes use it in Spanish to go deeper into the experiences, or actually at the same time if they're needing some distance from the experience but they still want to talk about it. And they can talk about it in English. Right. So if let's say, the experience was encoded in… in Spanish, they're needing some distance from it, then talk about the experience but talk about it, speak about it in English. And so really or maybe sometimes noticing when the client switches from one language to the other, so what happened there, so really using that as an intervention. 

00:39:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like in the clip coming up we should look for moment, in which kind of the English goes to Spanish. Oh, is there anything else we should look for? 

00:39:25
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. I think that umm… I want to see how Jackie uses language, you know. Yeah, when she switches I think the other thing I want to try to… to do in working with Jackie is also to help her feel like she doesn't need to translate because I do have the benefit of being bilingual myself, umm… that there can be a way of umm… if you welcome… welcoming her and her experiences into the room that she doesn't need to translate that I can. Actually, if I don't other word, I'll ask. But if I know the word, then that I can just kind of acknowledge that and we can continue talking about. 

00:40:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It attracts me that… that's really empowering for a client to truly feel like… like this is a space that I can be in because that's where I can… I can speak my… my true language, your tone. 

00:40:20
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. Without uh… Either being misunderstood which just what often happens umm… that we get misdiagnosed or misunderstood, so without feeling like I'm being misunderstood but actually that… that's been… that experiences being valued here. 

00:40:35
[sil.] 

00:40:40
OLGA L. MEJÍA Umm… So I'm curious I just shared with you that, you know, I also speak Spanish and that is my first language. I am wondering what comes up for you I see you hear that. 

00:40:50
JACKIE Well, that actually makes me feel really good because there are times when I guess specific words or memories or whatnot, umm… would make more sense in Spanish or maybe describe what I'm feeling better in Spanish so I think that's a plus. 

00:41:10
OLGA L. MEJÍA Okay. Good. Good. Yeah. You know, umm… I'll let you know that from the work that I do umm… actually there's a lot behind language. Right. And so as we talk here with each other and sometimes we might be talking about something that is particularly emotional or difficult or engaging, umm… I've learned that sometimes it helps to use the language that whatever you're thinking. It actually can help bring out more stuff. So I'm glad that it feels like it's comfortable and so I just work on that, umm… you know, for you to use whichever language feels comfortable for you. Umm… And so as we're talking about… about your… your family and kinda the struggle and kind of yourself, umm… what might be some early memories that come up for you, you know, around this… this struggle, or this tissue? 

00:42:15
[sil.] 

00:42:20
JACKIE Umm… Let's see. For some reason like shoes come up a lot. 

00:42:25
OLGA L. MEJÍA Shoes? 

00:42:25
JACKIE Shoes. Yes. (inaudible). So I guess, there was… This uh… The school I went in elementary was mainly umm… Latinos but there was some African-American and my students and I would see that they'd wear like Nike or Adidas and, you know, branding shoes and what I was seeing commercials as, you know, the shoes to wear, right. So and I, you know, I am one of four in my family. I'm the third. 

00:43:10
OLGA L. MEJÍA The third? 

00:43:15
JACKIE Yes. And so while my parents I guess didn't really know about brands or but we would get our shoes at the (inaudible) or but there were branded shoes, so… so I guess I always notice that… that I wish I had those shoes, and why can't I have those shoes and… You know, I'd tell my parents, like "Well, I want Nikes." And they're like, "Nikes is like why? These are good, you know." So I don't know that just comes up for me umm… what else. And… Oh, go ahead. 

00:44:00
OLGA L. MEJÍA I'm wondering as I… as I listened to you, it seems like that, you know, that the brand or the shoes for your parents weren't as important as it was for you. I think that you were growing up in this culture and perhaps within your parents culture, umm… shoes in this way weren't as important to… And so it didn't register for them. 

00:44:20
JACKIE Exactly or they would say, you know, "At least you have shoes, you know." We'd have to wear the same shoes back our… at our rancho and so… Yeah, I remember that, like thinking like I wish I could have those shoes. And then, also, for some reason, you know, at such an early age I understood like "Well, I can't be selfish and… and you know, it's four of us, and they can't afford to buy these shoes for all of us." So yeah, that… that comes up. 

00:44:55
OLGA L. MEJÍA I definitely hear the struggle. For I hear the struggle and… and kind of getting captured around… around shoes of the… the different cultures and the different expectations that umm… probably brought a lot of feelings for you internally and also for kind of these external, umm… kind of being imposed that somehow you should be wearing Nike shoes. And I also hear the longing of… Excuse me, wanting those Nike shoes. Can you tell me about the shoes you did have? 

00:45:35
JACKIE They were… I remember they were… the brand was Soda I think. And it's… it's really funny, you know, that I think about it. Because well there were Soda and then there was one like… like a Knockoff for Soda and Soda (inaudible). And I think we even… I think we have the Knockoff. And… and remember like I wanted the Soda and now knowing that soda wasn't even that like, you know, big that I wanted those shoes. And they're like… They had… It was… it was tennis shoes with the… with (inaudible) and I… and I really wanted those. So it's funny to me now but I guess at that moment as… as a little girl felt so real, but I couldn't have those and I guess, even then struggling with why do I want those that my parents kind afford them, so but I really want them when as little girl, you know, that's what I really wanted. And I couldn't have them. 

00:46:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA It sounded like he really wanted to fit in and there was a way of maybe being like your friends and what they had. 

00:46:45
JACKIE Yes. 

00:46:45
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. 

00:46:50
JACKIE And then another memory is that… that… that's coming up for me is we would go to Mexico like I mentioned and… every summer we'd stay there for a month or so, or you know, summer break. And so as… Yeah, so later in elementary, uh… I started learning English. Well, my English was… was becoming more dominant than Spanish. So there were certain words that I would… wouldn't be able to say in Spanish and so my family in Mexico would make fun of me… make fun of us. My… my siblings too. And again call us (inaudible) or (inaudible), you know, kind of stuff and… 

00:47:45
JACKIE Well, I would laugh and then, umm… and then a part of… or they would call us (inaudible). And I guess, a part of me was like (inaudible), you know, I… My skin a little bit lighter than my younger brother and I have lighter skin than my older brother and sister. There… there are darker skin, so then varied. Call my little and I (inaudible) because we were lighter. So that felt like oh yeah, I'm… I'm a green guy, you know. And… and then, then I also want it to be Mexican and but they didn't feel like I was Mexican or so… I guess a part of me… I didn't realize it then but I guess part of me didn't feel sad about that and I guess part of me just feel sad about that because that's still the case now when I do go and… 

00:48:50
OLGA L. MEJÍA When you go to Mexican? 

00:48:50
JACKIE Yes. Then I'm like (inaudible), you know, and now there's Google Translate… 

00:49:00
OLGA L. MEJÍA I can translate myself. 

00:49:00
JACKIE Right away, yes, so umm… and my Spanish has gotten much better and… and not as broken as before. So there are… they've noticed the improvements so that's good, umm… but I was still not fully Mexican, you know, in their eyes. 

00:49:15
OLGA L. MEJÍA Uh-huh. And that's what it feels like. 

00:49:15
JACKIE And that's what it feels like to me when I'm there and yet when I'm here in the United States, it feels like, "Well, I'm Mexican." That's what everybody else sees me as… I'm not… maybe I don't… I'm not fully American. 

00:49:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. So as we talk about, there… there is a lot that's coming out, you know, that we can as we go through that we'll come up, but I think what sounding out to me right now is as you started by talking about the struggle of how do I identify, you know, am I more Mexican and am I more American. And then, also, this issue of language, right, the language that… Spanish is your first language but then when you started at school have been feeling like you've had an accent, uh… but then when you want to Mexico, then not really knowing the words, umm… as you started to learn more English. And so I really hear the struggle. Earlier you said, umm… (inaudible), right. And so umm… either from here or from there and that's really… I'm feeling as… as we're talking. Right. So in some ways that language has capturing some of this difficulty of where do I belong, like who am I. 

00:50:35
JACKIE Yes, that's the big question, like what… If I'm too independent and too Americanized and to collect… You know, if I'm… Yeah, too collectivistic that I'm too Mexican, so it's been really difficult to try to find that balance of "Well, this is me, and I'm taking from both." But then, it's… I guess the struggle is in trying to… to make meaning or I guess find the language to be able to explain that, to others. And I guess to myself, you know, I'm being okay with… with what fits for me. And then if I… then also thinking about if, you know, if this fits for me, it's nothing for my family and how do I fit in with… how do I fit in… 

00:51:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. 

00:51:35
JACKIE You know… 

00:51:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. Absolutely. So I think you're… you're articulating this very well. I think that this is definitely something that we can talk about together, you know, in some ways that we can come up with your own language, right. That fits for you and I also hear that it's important for you to fit with your family, right. And so umm… it sounds like a very precarious balance to try to find and… and yet I think it's possible, and so I think that it's something that we can work on that language together as we go through. 

00:52:05
JACKIE It sounds good. Thank you. 

00:52:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA Okay. 

00:52:10
DEBRIEFING OF SKILL NUMBER TWO: 

00:52:10
Language as an Intervention 

00:52:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is this a good example of language as an intervention? 

00:52:20
OLGA L. MEJÍA I do think it's a good example. Yeah. I… I really wanted to go with the flow as I was talking with Jackie, and I was paying close attention to how is she using language and… and thinking, do I want to… And she had asked me before if I spoke Spanish, and said that I do, umm… and yet we hadn't spoken Spanish yet. Now and so I was waiting, you know, is there something that I should introduce, is she waiting for me to introduce it, or I'm waiting for her to… to bring it up, and so it was really I kind of go with the flow if you will, but more than anything. I was wanting to… again, welcome her experiences into the room. I believe umm… you know, when we kinda went on to talk about (inaudible), you know, to talk about shoes. I thought that… that was really interesting and I felt like that took us to an important places of her kind of really being able to talk about her struggle, you know, kind of that got caught up in… in the (inaudible), you know, do you wear Nike shoes or do you wear these shoes and… umm… that I think was another example of how language was capturing some of her struggle, and the way that she was talking about it but also the memory that it was bringing up for her. 

00:53:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, it's… it's funny. It struck me and watching that… that when she said shoes, you said in Spanish back, uh… she kind of gave you smile and then she kind of like went a little deeper, you know, it looks like there's a validation of the story and you can tell your story the way you want to tell it. You know, I thought that was really… I thought that was unique. I mean, it was subtle but it was unique. 

00:54:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA Well, and I think that's… that's in the way that kind of learning to use language as… as an intervention, so not so much just as a way of communication, which is truly important, you now, but that… it's an intervention and so there you saw my struggle with it, do I introduce it first or do I let her to introduce that, and so my (inaudible). Right, that… It's like okay. 

00:54:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON She embraced it. That's a bit like… Yes. 

00:54:30
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. So again, you know, there was that inner struggle for me, do I or do I not, but it seemed to… at that moment, it seemed to fit. So it sounds like there's a piece on the… you as the therapist, which is to kind of watch when it… when it kinda fits and I mentioned some other clients, who might in the same experience go right into Spanish. Right. Another one might be a bit hesitant. 

00:54:55
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yes. Yes. And… and in all of those I'm assessing. And I… I… First I'm… I'm kind of going with the flow and trying to meet the client where they're at, but depending… Yeah, I do have clients that they go right for Spanish and if anything, you know, umm… sometimes I struggle with my own Spanish… Or I'll say I struggle with therapeutic Spanish, and so then I get challenged. You know, when they're only speaking Spanish, and then I welcome all of those experiences, both in terms of the client and then also my struggle with it, and then kind of bringing that into the room too. 

00:55:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Skill number three, understand the client's worldview. So what does the understanding a client's worldview and why is it important to address? 

00:55:40
OLGA L. MEJÍA So uh… really important to… to understand where the clients coming from. I think that umm… at times that I might see the client, you know, will notice things about them, notice their gender, notice their race, notice their language, you know, all of those, and so I'm making some guesses and some assumptions. Umm… At the same time, the reality of it is I don't know their experience. Right. And so as a counselor, umm… I want to know what their… And so more than anything, I want to be curious. I want to be curious and I want to ask and I want to explore and I want to know the details of their story and so with… and working with Jackie, you know, that we're both… We both identify as Mexican, Mexican-American and so we shared that and we both identify as female, umm… and so even though we might, you know, maybe education, we might share some… So I can have. I can know that but then the reality of it is, we might be real different in the way we define being Mexican, and so I want to know what it means for her, uh… and all those different worldviews. 

00:56:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. And I get the sense that the most counselors will say, "Oh yeah, I always understand my client's worldview." But I… you know, it sounds like you're saying something little bit different, which is not just understanding but it's kinda going a little bit deeper on that… that the… the experience of kinda going deeper into a client's worldview or histories has a… has a different outcome. 

00:57:20
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. Yeah. I think that it's… it's not until we really get into the details of their worldview and their stories that then we really start to go. Oh! Okay. Now I understand, and then… Once I can understand then I can help the client make more sense or better understand their own history as well. 

00:57:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So in this clip, when you work with Jackie which will we be looking for? 

00:57:45
OLGA L. MEJÍA So umm… I would look for umm… in what ways am I working to understand her worldview, and then, does it… and my reflections to her, does it seems like I'm understanding her, and I'm hearing her. 

00:58:00
EXAMPLE OF SKILL NUMBER THREE: 

00:58:00
Understand a Client's Worldview 

00:58:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA You know, as… as we've been talking, I know, you've talked about… we've been talking about different cultures and I wanted to take a step back a little bit and to try to understand, umm… you said that your parents came here when they were in their mid to late teens, and then they met here, and so they're immigrants and then you were born here. I actually would like to understand a little bit more about that, you know, what that experience was like what you know about your parents background when they came and what they went through. Or why they came here in the first place? Umm… So if… you'd like to share some of that with me? 

00:58:50
JACKIE Okay. So my mom… my mom is the… She's four or third… Yeah, she's one of six. And I think she's the third oldest or fourth, something like. 

00:59:10
OLGA L. MEJÍA Kind of a bigger family. 

00:59:10
JACKIE Yes. So… 

00:59:10
OLGA L. MEJÍA She's one of the middle children, it sounds like… 

00:59:15
JACKIE Exactly. And my grandmother… my mom's mom. Well, my mom's dad passed away when my mom was 13, probably around that age, so and her older siblings, her two older sisters had… Well, (inaudible), you know, they… they… No, the two older (inaudible). So they… they were off with their family. 

00:59:50
OLGA L. MEJÍA Okay. (inaudible). 

00:59:50
JACKIE And. Yeah, they got married. And my the… the oldest and only male and my mom's family, he… he was here in the United States, so my mom became… I guess like a second mom to her younger siblings because my grandmother had to work and all, find resources to be able to help her kids, eat them and… and provide shelter for them. So umm… my mom became very… I guess independent, and wanted to help her mom but… and along the way, she's also going to school and they lived in Rancho and then my mom went to the city to… to learn… to be a secretary or something like that. But she… she encountered many struggles along the way so decided to come here to… 

01:00:55
OLGA L. MEJÍA What kinds of struggles? 

01:01:00
JACKIE Like family struggles were uh… just where she… she have to live with other families and they were… they weren't very nice to her. Umm… She was like a… (inaudible), you know. So what… she… That's what she said she felt. 

01:01:15
OLGA L. MEJÍA That's how she felt. Yeah. 

01:01:20
JACKIE So she came here. Her brother was here and she crossed through… through (inaudible) I believe through the mountains or something like that and… 

01:01:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA So when she came here, she didn't have her legal documentation or she didn't? 

01:01:40
JACKIE No. No. She didn't so she had to cross illegally. Umm… I think couple of times… I think she… I think it was during Christmas time because she mentioned she spent Christmas out in the mountains. And I guess they got caught several times and they were sent back and she'd come back. 

01:02:00
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. It happens a lot. 

01:02:05
JACKIE Yes. So she came with one of her friends and like a cousin or something and met her brother here, and so she was here for… Yeah, she was young. She was in late teens, and she started working, sending my… my grandmother money for help, umm… to… to build a house I believe. Her and her brother would do that. 

01:02:30
OLGA L. MEJÍA So she came seeking kind of a better life… 

01:02:35
JACKIE Yes. For her and her family. And umm… Well, back then, they didn't have FaceTime, so they would write letters to each other, and so my mom says she was very homesick and… Excuse me. And she would… she would get really excited when she'd get mail from Mexico or when she'd be able to call her mom, she'd be very happy about that. And then, she met my dad here, working at a warehouse, so I'm sure… My dad's story of coming here, he… he had a lot of cousins, second cousins, not first cousins. First cousin's here. And so he… he crossed to illegally and I'm not too aware of, or I don't know his story of crossing very much but he came here and he stayed with his cousins and started working again also to help my grandparents. So he would send money and umm… My data's… My dad was one of 11. Yes. 

01:03:55
OLGA L. MEJÍA So both of your parents came from big families. 

01:03:55
JACKIE Yes. Yes. My grandmother had 16 pregnancies and four died at birth. Then my youngest uncle at 18, he… he died in a car accident. And then… 

01:04:15
OLGA L. MEJÍA And this is your paternal side? 

01:04:15
JACKIE My paternal side, yeah, my dad's side and then my dad passed away four years ago. But he… 

01:04:20
OLGA L. MEJÍA I'm sorry for that. 

01:04:25
JACKIE Yeah. So… He… So his… He was the first one of his family to… his immediate family to come here and following my dad coming then some of his brothers came once my dad was settled. And during this time, my mom and my dad got married, and so he… my dad always had people coming from Mexico illegally. Umm… He would host them until they were ready to then… them to go about their life and create their own life here. 

01:05:10
OLGA L. MEJÍA Kinda helping family from back from Mexico to kinda get transitioned. 

01:05:15
JACKIE Exactly. So that was… that was his story all along, so then we were born. And we… we lived in a house with one of my dad's brothers and his family, so we shared the house, but my… my dad always… Well, I guess my mom too, so both my parents… Well, I guess it was for my dad because my mom… she liked her privacy but… but she was willing to have people for. So we… we had a lot of people stopped by or stay with us for periods of time and then they… they made their life here. 

01:06:00
OLGA L. MEJÍA So you kind of got to see a lot of immigrant trajectory… 

01:06:05
JACKIE Exactly. 

01:06:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA So and I'm… I'm curious, you know, as your… as I'm listening to the story of how your mom came and that sounds, you know, kind of getting spending Christmas out in the mountains and getting caught and sent back and then your dad as well, and then more family coming over. What is it like right now talking with me about that? 

01:06:30
JACKIE Well, I guess it's very… it almost fills me with like pride and it's like a combination of pride and sadness because they had to go through that umm… but I guess I never really think about their journey and you know, what that must have been like for them to get to this point, uh… and the struggles… You know, it's not easy to cross that border and… and getting caught, and you know, going to hills without a bed, you know, even… I don't know with water… I didn't know if they had water. But just to think of everything that they went through to get to this point and… and now to see me. I guess, you know, everything that they did was for us, you know, maybe that I know that then… 

01:07:30
OLGA L. MEJÍA So having that awareness right now as we're talking about it that that's part of what we can do on our work together, you know, or what we're doing in our work together is to help give you a context. Right. If like I'm thinking about, you know, the struggle of my Mexican, am I more American, or is… is they're balancing, right, to… to understand that struggle, within the context of your parents' immigrant story, right, that in some ways that's your immigrant story as well. It's just that you're happens… happens here. 

01:08:10
JACKIE Exactly. Yes, so, you know, thinking about this because it's been my… my parents have lived here, and I don't think that they were expecting to stay here, you know. 

01:08:20
OLGA L. MEJÍA They had plan in going back? 

01:08:25
JACKIE Mm-hmm. So and I think that… that actually they did when my older brother was born. He was a year and they… they went back to Mexico and they just weren't used to that anymore, so they came back. They had changed too much. Yeah so… 

01:08:40
OLGA L. MEJÍA And so now I know that you said, initially your parents came here and they didn't have the legal documentation, umm… and then you and your siblings were born here, what is that like now for your parents? 

01:08:55
JACKIE Well, they're… they're US citizens and so they got the residency when in '86 with umm… the Ronald Reagan… 

01:09:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. It was in 1986 

01:09:10
JACKIE So that's… And that's my… my… my sister, my older sister was born in 1986. So yeah, so I… I guess I never saw the struggle of being undocumented or having a family that wasn't documented, umm… or I guess that fear of feeling my… you know, my parents are documented. What does that mean for me, am I gonna lose them? I never had that. And yeah, I… you know, I empathize because I had family who… who do have that status, and you know, I see that struggle and that fear and especially with everything going on now and so I guess I get defensive sometimes too, you know, and… and just talking about my parents and my immigrant or… Yeah, they're… they're journey coming here, you know, and all they had… Everything that they had to endure and go through and umm… like, I want to have this life if it wasn't for them doing all of that. 

01:10:25
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah, that can be pretty significant having undocumented status can really bring a significant amount of stress to an individual and to a family, and so umm… right now you said that it brings some defensiveness, can you help me understand that? 

01:10:40
JACKIE Well, with, you know, political views now about being undocumented, you know, how unfortunately umm… 

01:10:50
[sil.] 

01:10:55
JACKIE Some people categorize immigrants as Mexican being bad people, you know. And I get defensive because that's perhaps, yes, there might be some criminals that come or, you know, and… and do things that they shouldn't. But I feel like the vast majority are coming here to give their children a life, uh… that they couldn't have back in their home country. And I get defensive because I wouldn't been able to have this life. Had it been… had it not been for my parents coming here. 

01:11:40
OLGA L. MEJÍA So that (inaudible) not so much here but that it's more defensiveness when you hear about these issues, kind of in our wider society and kinda been a politics, current politics… That makes sense. So let's talk some more about that umm… In a little bit. 

01:11:55
JACKIE Okay. 

01:12:00
DEBRIEFING OF SKILL NUMBER THREE: 

01:12:00
Understand a Client's Worldview 

01:12:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So Olga, is this a good example of understanding the client's worldview? 

01:12:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. I think it's a good example. I… I was getting the sense from talking with Jackie that, you know, she talked about this struggle kind of in-between the Mexican and the America. I umm… she had talked about her family, had talked about her… her parents and so. You know, knowing that immigration can be a huge event, you know, kind of a life changing event in a family and to try to contextualize, you know, umm… Jackie's struggle. I wanted to hear some about her parents, umm… kinda immigrant's story, you know, and I think that umm… that it was a really rich story, you know, of what she shared that I… I kind of I… She talked about her mom kinda coming across and having to go across the, you know, mountains and getting caught and having to be sent back, I think that starts to… starts to really inform a lot of who Jackie is, and also with her dad and how they met. 

01:13:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, I got the sense that she was kind of maybe tell me your story that she's kinda told before but she was telling it, may be experiencing a different kind of way as he took past and brought it into the present… 

01:13:25
OLGA L. MEJÍA Right. 

01:13:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And how… and how that affects her and you can see kind of a change even in her, like there was almost a tearing her eye, a couple of points and… 

01:13:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA Right. That… that's part of what I'm wanting to do, that yes, that may… Actually for a lot of clients, they haven't told their immigrant story, you know, I did get the sense that… that Jackie knew some of her parents immigrant story and so that's good. But yeah, I want to take it deeper that that I want… I'm trying to build a context for this struggle that she's been through, talking about. For sure, I want to know about her… her family, uh… but… and I want to know about her family as it relates to her. And so kind of bringing in that, you know, what brought her parents to the US in the first place, how does that still play out here today in her struggle. 

01:14:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It just strikes me as you say that… that for so many people, it's so easy just to say, "Oh, my parents are immigrants," and it stops right there for a variety of reasons that the known goes deeper because political reasons because of… of fear of actually telling that story or the pain of telling the story… 

01:14:30
OLGA L. MEJÍA Absolutely. 

01:14:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And yet here are the story gets a different telling, like it (inaudible) to actually be told in a way so that you really understand what sort that means to Jackie. 

01:14:40
OLGA L. MEJÍA Right. Right. That not only what it means for Jackie but what it means for her parents. And in the ways that she's internalized her parents, right, and how she makes sense of it. And so really being able to really tell the story, you know, and maybe tell more of the story in the future too. Uh… And how then that still impacts Jackie. 

01:15:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. You know, I can just in closing I get… I get the sense that Jackie felt, umm… understood at the end of that but he also got the sense that you as a counselor, you felt you understood her lot more too. 

01:15:15
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. Yeah. I think that umm… in what I know about all… What I'll say it's also, you know, because I'm an immigrant myself, you know, as I listen to Jackie, I was checking myself, you know, how much of this is her story, how much of it do I know about immigrant, you know, and so yeah, I think in the ways that maybe… I was understanding her was… for one hearing her story but also knowing about immigrant stories myself, that I was connecting with her in that way as well. 

01:15:50
[sil.] 

01:15:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Skill number four, consciousness raising. Olga, what is meant by consciousness reason? 

01:16:00
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. So consciousness raising, is I want to… So working from my… multicultural feminist perspective, you know, well, I want to connect with the client. I want to listen to the client? Understand what's bringing them in, you know, and kind of explore all of that, built that relationship, build trust. Umm… At some point, I want to help the client understand that whatever's bringing them in, sure, part of it might be themselves, part of it might be their family, might be but also, some of their difficulty or their struggle also as embedded in the wider society. And so how can I help them start to understand that, umm… kind of begin to understand that or enhance their understanding of that. 

01:16:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So kind of, uh… interest like… like a contextual worldview as well, but maybe isn't just the client would get the climate is better than a larger kind of context. 

01:17:00
OLGA L. MEJÍA Exactly. Right. And I think quite often clients come in feeling like this is just my issue, and not really having kind of perhaps the wider understanding of that given their race, given their gender, given their ethnicity, given their socioeconomic background, that… that all has implications within the greater society and the greater society and given how power's distributed that is impacting. The individual is impacting the family, so I want to help them in some way shape or form helped them understand that. 

01:17:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So this is a real core tenet of kind of feminist therapy right. The notion of the personal being… being political, right. Okay. 

01:17:40
OLGA L. MEJÍA Absolutely. Right. 

01:17:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So what should we be paying attention to in this clip for Jackie? 

01:17:45
OLGA L. MEJÍA Umm… And so I would pay attention to see… I… I always feel like that that's not always an easy thing to bring up in counseling because I think they're often been conversations that haven't been talked about or within the traditional counseling worlds. And so perhaps clients also aren't quite used to having those conversations just kinda into the room, and so notice to see how I invite that conversation and if it seems like that something that fits for Jackie or not. 

01:18:20
[sil.] 

01:18:25
OLGA L. MEJÍA So I think you bring up a really good point in terms of that defensiveness that comes up for you and I think that's, you know, something that we can talk about some more and so umm… So here, I'm gonna throw out this idea and tell me what umm… if it fits for you, it doesn't fit for you. I… I think in our current climate, so, you know, a lot of that kind of politics and kind of wider society, there's so much around immigration. Right. I think both undocumented immigration and legal immigration as well. So there's a lot of negative messages in particular around that and so I really feel like that's something that impacts individuals and impacts families. And so sometimes we take on those messages and sometimes we don't… but sometimes we do and so I'm curious how you're hearing that within the context of knowing your family's kinda immigrant journey, you know, through your mom and your dad. Umm… How do you take in these messages, whether… How do you make sense of them? 

01:19:40
JACKIE Well, it really makes me sad, you know, and then hurts me because when I hear these messages, it's like a message being directed at my family and… and those messages don't hold true for my family. 

01:19:55
[sil.] 

01:20:00
JACKIE And so, you know, it's really sad that these messages are being fed to the country and… and you know, to people who probably believe that these are true. Uh… And so I don't take very well. And in fact, I… I tried to do my part in, you know, trying to, you know, bring about awareness or, you know, go to the marches and protests and… 

01:20:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA Oh good. So you're involved in that way kind of doing some advocacy. 

01:20:40
JACKIE Exactly. So I… you know, I wish… I could do more and but I feel like, right now, you know, that's what I can do, and that's what I'm doing. 

01:20:45
OLGA L. MEJÍA I'm curious what drives you to get involved in the marches and you know, doing this advocacy work around… particularly around the immigration? It sounds like… 

01:21:00
JACKIE Well, first because… You know, if… if in 1986, that… that migration umm… or this an amnesty right, the amnesty. If that wouldn't have passed then my parents what had been undocumented until one of us was or my older brother was 21, you know. So, you know, they got lucky with that, and they are very fortunate to have that but if that wasn't the case and they would have struggled or, you know, we would have had that same impact that some families who aren't documented have. And I have, like I said I have family members that are… are not documented, you know, and one of my cousins has lived here since she was three months and you know, she's now 25, so she doesn't know anything other than this country. 

01:22:00
OLGA L. MEJÍA So it really sounds like for your immediate family and maybe also extended family that you've been impacted in real significant ways by umm… the amnesty laws and by current kinda… the current messages around immigration, and I know the… the marches lately have been about immigration as well, about gender. Right. And I think that's, you know, really aware that you identify as a woman, you identify as Mexican-American and so kind of in the ways that all of that intersects for you and also how that plays out in your family. 

01:22:45
JACKIE Exactly. So I thought that's what drives me and you know, just like I guess, my way of thinking is I want to be the voice for those who don't necessarily haven't or afraid to use it. You know, and rightfully so… So that's what I want to do and that's what drives me to go to those marches or you know, may cause, you know, whatever. You know, whatever I can to, then I try to do that or just bringing awareness even within my family. 

01:23:15
OLGA L. MEJÍA Sure. Yeah I think that umm… as we've… as we've been talking, I've definitely send some… I don't know if this is the right word to correct me if it doesn't feel right but kind of anger or defensiveness around these messages because you said it feels like they're talking to your family, right and so I can understand how part of you takes that in. And… and so I guess part of what we can work out together is understanding that these are also messages outside of your family, that these are messages outside of you, and that in a lot of ways, your anger makes sense to me, that your reaction to being told something that doesn't fit for you or doesn't fit for your family, that anger makes sense. And so I really like in the ways that you are using that, you know, and we can explore that some more but in the ways that you're using that to go on marches and to like, you said, have for those that can't speak for themselves that you can be that voice. 

01:24:20
JACKIE Okay. 

01:24:25
[sil.] 

01:24:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So Olga, is this a good example of conscience reason? 

01:24:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. I think it was a good… a good example. I… Umm… saw, you know, you saw some of the dance of how, you know, how… how do I introduce. We had been talking about immigration and kind of her parents' immigrant story. You know, I also had heard Jackie talk about her struggle of, you know, and maybe feeling kinda this shame around how much… how Mexican… and how American. And so I wanted to try to give a context to that, so that it's not just about, you know, the shame that I feel for myself. You know, that I… I just don't know how to do this. But actually, that this is… In our… in… in our environment and our politics right now, actually that's a huge topic. Right and so… she had also. I was really aware that she talked about her parents early on when they first came having undocumented status. And so, I know that that can create a huge amount of stress for a family, uh… and for an individual. And so I wanted to try to bring kind of the political uh… sociopolitical conversation around immigration. You know, I had sensed. I think at some point she kind of said, you know, I feel defensive and… and I wasn't quite sure so I kinda of asked her, you know, what's that defensiveness about because if that was about us, then I wanted to talk about but I think the way I understood it was, you know, that the way that immigration I think right now has such a negative umm… message right in our society. How could it not impact her as an individual and how cannot impact her family? So I wanted to try. I think you saw me try to, umm… bring an awareness of that. 

01:26:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. It seems like a contrast (inaudible) two because earlier on she was talking about, maybe feeling ashamed for talking about these experiences and yet, you know, she's someone who, in some ways she's active… She umm… thus have support and… and knows that she kinda connected… kind of what happened to allow her… her parents umm… to become US citizens. The activism that happened at that time, she was continuing the kind of what she's doing (inaudible), like it's… it's her time. And so there's… like, a sense that there's some pride around that too. 

01:27:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA Which was really nice to see, right, that there… There can't… Once we can start to have these conversations that there can be a shift from… I definitely hear the difficulty in the struggle and kinda the shame around, you know, that kind of her identities. Right. The different identities and how they're shifting umm… and as we're having these conversations about these stories, right, that there can be a space of where like, "Oh, I actually feel really proud of this" and, you know, and that… I actually was nicely surprised to hear her how active she is. And she kinda maybe this defensiveness or maybe this anchor the way that I interpreted. You know, that she's really doing something with it, umm… and so that was nice to hear. 

01:27:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Skill number five, strength-based empowerment. What a strength-based empowerment? 

01:27:55
OLGA L. MEJÍA Strength-based empowerment, umm… I… As I work with clients, you know, clients come in… in too distress. Right. And I think they are caught up in their difficulty that it… at times feels it's almost impossible for them to know that actually a lot is going right. You know, and that they have a lot of strengths and they have a lot of resources. Right. Because I think that there… there filter out the moment is so just to stress. You know, they're having such difficulties and so… I really, umm… I think part of my work is to help them to see, you know, how… how have you gone through this before and what are some true strengths that you have and how can we draw from that. 

01:28:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it's identification of certain kinds of strengths and then acknowledging that you can draw from these into the future. 

01:28:50
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yes. Exactly. 

01:28:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What do we look for in this clip for Jackie? 

01:28:55
OLGA L. MEJÍA And so I would look for… in the ways that I explore with her, attempt to explore with her, you know, her strengths. You know, what are the… kind of the positive coping skills that she has, that she has used in the past and that maybe she has available, and how I tried to encourage her to draw from that. 

01:29:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:29:15
[sil.] 

01:29:20
OLGA L. MEJÍA We've been talking about, you know, umm… you've shared with me their story about your parents and kinda their journey around immigration, and then… then we started out by talking about umm… kind of this inner struggle that you're having, some really having a much better understanding of that inner struggle kind of in the context of your family history, umm… but also really within the context of the wider society and the way our society is right now with the messages around. In some ways, a lot of under-represented groups like immigrants or are like women or umm… and so, I'm curious, you know, as you have been managing these struggles, umm… how have you managed? You know, I… I've heard you say that there's, uh… you're feeling proud of your family, you feel proud of your culture through the struggles. How have you managed through all this? 

01:30:25
JACKIE I guess, you know, being in school, umm… I found people like me and friends who had similar experiences and… and trying to manage all of that, and I… I think just being able to talk to them and understanding that I'm not the only one that goes through this and that struggles with, you know. Do I tell my (inaudible) that I'm questioning being Catholic or… 

01:31:00
OLGA L. MEJÍA Sounds like a big deal. 

01:31:00
JACKIE Mm-hmm. And do I… You know, how do I respond to my mom when she tells me umm… you know, school has changed me and so, you know, or my dad, you know, too like go to church, you know, so, you know, religion is very important in our family. Umm… And so just being able to talk to someone about that and… and relating, or stories, or maybe understanding what they did or… or I guess just… Yeah, talking about it. 

01:31:45
OLGA L. MEJÍA So you've been really able to reach out to friends and sounds like and to others who are like maybe in the same kind of education, can appear all in the same boat. But also really finding out that you're not alone, that others have similar struggles. And it seems like, right now kind of an additional struggle is around religion. You know, I hear that for a lot people and it sounds like for your family, religion is umm… perhaps… It's helpful and it's a source of strength and support. Umm… I'm curious what religion means to you, kinda within knowing this about your family and that you come from your family but also what does it mean for you. 

01:32:30
JACKIE Well, I was raised Catholic and… and especially my dad's side is very, very Catholic… 

01:32:40
OLGA L. MEJÍA What does that mean very, very Catholic? 

01:32:45
JACKIE Well, my grandmother lives across the street from… it's like a school of priests. So they go and… before becoming priest. 

01:32:50
OLGA L. MEJÍA Like a seminary… 

01:32:55
JACKIE Yeah. Seminary. And so she my grandmother is… For me, it's… she's like the purest form of Catholicism. Like she's true to their religion and then I feel like it's a really beautiful thing, you know, and… and my, you know, my dad too. He is a very devout Catholic. Umm… So most of his siblings are, and my mom too, and not as much as my dad's family. Umm… And I was too for most of my life and I enjoyed going to church and umm… my dad and I knew all of the songs, it allows my (inaudible) part with singing and… 

01:33:50
OLGA L. MEJÍA Singing with your dad. 

01:33:50
JACKIE Singing with my dad. So… so religion or Catholicism for me was just a way of, umm… I guess it felt safe, like… like a safe place, and where I can, you know, connect to a higher being and I felt, you know, as family, so I felt like family because that's what we would do every Sunday. 

01:34:25
OLGA L. MEJÍA So it's familiar. It felt safe, it was comforting. 

01:34:25
JACKIE I was… Yeah. Exactly. And then I… I started listening to some of the messages and they didn't really fit well. With me and that's… we go back to, you know, my values like now creating my own values and you know, a lot of the teachings, umm… didn't reflect what I believed in, so you know, I started moving away from… from that and so currently I'm not religious. So I'm more, you know, trying to find peace within myself and I guess more spiritual and trying to find, you know, like I said more peaceful in myself and understanding how… how I wanted my life and what makes sense for me and I feel like that, as long as I, you know, bring out the best in me and I'm not hurting anyone, then… then that's okay. But it… that's… that's hard for a lot of my family to understand. 

01:35:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA Sure. Well, umm… you know, the way that I'm understanding that family is really important to you, right and so… Again, this struggle and this umm… precarious balance of kind of collectivistic and individualistic, right. And I hear that, umm… as we talk about religion, that religion has some really important connections to your parent, to your (inaudible) and to your dad. Right. Umm… And so there's this strength part of it. The positive part of it. Uh… But then also, there is a struggle with it, around the messages and growing up in the US for you, umm… that don't quite fit for you. And so in some ways might be it's developing in the ways that religion has provided safety and comfort and familiarity for you, you know, part of the work that, umm… we can talk with each other here is kind of developing umm… other ways, you know, or maybe understanding better or kind of struggle around religion as well. Okay. 

01:36:35
JACKIE Yeah. Definitely. 

01:36:40
OLGA L. MEJÍA Umm… And I do like hearing that, umm… you do reach out to your support system, you know, and I… I think that… that can be really helpful as well. 

01:36:50
JACKIE Yeah. It's been very helpful, definitely. 

01:36:50
OLGA L. MEJÍA Okay. 

01:36:55
[sil.] 

01:37:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So Olga, is this an example of a strength-based empowerment? 

01:37:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA I think so yeah, it's good… a good example, you kind of saw me ask about, you know, how is she able to manage, you know, these struggle, you know, that she's having in trying to figure out these different identities and kind of in the ways that umm… her different identities shift or intersect and so, you know, I think that she talked about kind of being able to reach out for support. You know, I think that's something that we can really work with to encourage her to in those moments of through distress. That she can uh… draw from support, it seems like, you know, that there are fellow students that she's really able to connect with. 

01:37:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. I got that piece where you kinda relating her kinda like, you're not alone, right. Like people are out there and… and you have these people around you who are your… your support system. 

01:37:55
OLGA L. MEJÍA Absolutely I think that that universality, I think quite often clients come in, feeling like, I'm the only one who feel this… All of us, I think that's kinda part of being a human, that it often when we're in the midst of it… it feels like I'm the only one, and it can be truly powerful to know that actually others feel similar, and so really I was trying to emphasize that for her. 

01:38:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It just struck me even with… with people who have marginalized identities and society in a sense, there's a lot of messages saying that you're not good enough, right. They become strength in numbers in which realizing that, you know, other people around and they're strong and you're strong. And… 

01:38:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yes. Yeah. Absolutely. I think with different kind of under-represented marginalized groups, I think that that's a true strength that there is something you can do about it, right and even if it's knowing that others feel similar and then we can kind of come together and support each other, uh… and then do something more perhaps around activism or things like that. 

01:38:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, it struck me, you know, as I was watching this clip, umm… she's talking about religion and as I was watching it, I was thinking, "Oh, I think I know, where this might go, that she kind of feel so curveball," or I'm saying, I'm not really religious anymore, you know. And yet, it also seems like even that can be a strength. Right. That she knows what she kinda (inaudible) was able to kind of find, you know, the (inaudible) to stand up. 

01:39:20
OLGA L. MEJÍA For sure. Yeah. I think what comes up… what came up for me as I was, you know, talking with Jackie. Certainly it's like, "Oh wait," you know, that there was that moment of thought, but I think really the way that I was conceptualizing is this idea that our strengths are our weaknesses, and our weaknesses are our strengths, that as she talked about religion I think for many people, umm… not for all but for many Latin (inaudible) client's, so for all I think that those that identify as Catholic because not everybody does but those that religion can be a true strength. Umm… So I did hear some of that in terms of how she connected with her grandmother, with (inaudible) and how she connected with her… with her dad that she knew all the songs. You know, that was a true moment of connecting that can be a strength. I also heard that the struggle there she was talking about what showing up here too. Well, showing up in… in religion and so I think that if anything, umm… that that's something that we can work with. Yeah, what parts, you know, let's break down religion, what parts of it are strengths and what parts of it can we start helping her redefine for herself. 

01:40:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Skill number six, Loteria. So Olga, let's talk about Loteria. 

01:40:40
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yes. 

01:40:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What is it? 

01:40:45
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yes. It's a good question. So Loteria, it's like, umm… if you… if you well, it's Mexican Bingo. It's a traditional game that has kind of cards and then these individual cards and the idea is with Bingo is you play with friends or family and to try to get either a row or column or get the whole card and whoever gets it first wins. Umm… And so that's the idea, the way that I use Loteria is that, you know, Loteria is a big part of Mexican culture, right and so… and Jackie coming in letting me know that that was part of her background. I was curious if this is something that she related to. Right and so I use Loteria the way that I think it can bring up a lot of memories, I think it can bring up a lot of kind of deep feelings. And so I want to welcome that into the room, you know, kind of been a culturally responsive, culturally sensitive way. 

01:41:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. So it sounds like you use a variety of reasons as a way to kind of maybe get access to deeper kind of motions or experiences, umm… and also I mean the… the pitch… the cards are very illustrated clearly, and you must bring up a lot based on past experiences but just what's in the picture themselves. 

01:42:00
OLGA L. MEJÍA Absolutely it's kind of a protective if you will. Right. It's a culturally congruent protective. Right. That it can really bring in some pretty… I… I'd been nicely surprised myself and how much it brings up for clients. 

01:42:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So when we see a uses intervention with Jackie, what should we look for? 

01:42:25
OLGA L. MEJÍA You know you should look for how I introduce it, right, and so because… it's just because I think it's something that might be useful for her, it might not be, right. And so it's something that I want to, you know, is this something that's okay for her, for us to… to do this. Is she open to it? Umm… And then just see what comes up for her in terms of what memories, what feelings uh… what discussions we have and… and then I'm gonna try to kind of bring her deeper and to an understanding of whatever memories or feelings come up for her. 

01:43:00
[sil.] 

01:43:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA Well, Jackie I'm really appreciating that you're sharing with me, and I think we're having a good basis on, you know, what to… to work on together, as we're doing this work and so… I have an activity that we can do… Umm… Are you familiar with Loteria? 

01:43:20
JACKIE Yes. 

01:43:20
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yes. Okay. So you have the cards here from the Loteria, can you tell me a little bit about how you know or remember Loteria? 

01:43:35
JACKIE Well, that always reminds you Mexico, you know, when we go to my (inaudible), my dad's mom, umm… every Sunday, it's church and then go back to her house and then Loteria, other card games, something, a poker, you know, and that's includes little kids. Umm… We played for, uh… money, so Pesos, we use Pesos and so it gets really competitive and… But it's really fun. So it reminds me a lot of Mexico, so it brings back a lot of memories of that, and… and we play that here too with our… with my family… 

01:44:15
OLGA L. MEJÍA In the US. 

01:44:15
JACKIE In the US. So a lot of good memories. 

01:44:15
OLGA L. MEJÍA Okay. So yeah, then you know it well and it really brings up a lot of memories of family and Sunday afternoons. Yeah. Maybe some competition… 

01:44:25
JACKIE A lot. 

01:44:30
OLGA L. MEJÍA A lot of competitiveness with all family members. So great. So you do… do know it and you remember it and so, you know, as you think about us talking today, and what's been coming up for you in terms of the struggles that you're having around identity and kind of your umm… I know initially you said, you know, and kinda what your mom and times that kinda comes out and but I know, you also talked about your (inaudible) and about memories with your dad, and kind of siblings and cousins and so. As you think about our conversation and, what thoughts, what feelings come up for you. Okay, so as you think about that, umm… I want to ask you to look at the cards we played out here. And pick maybe two or three cards that speak to you and then talk to me about them. 

01:45:25
[sil.] 

01:45:40
JACKIE Okay. So these are the ones I'm gonna (inaudible). (inaudible). 

01:45:50
OLGA L. MEJÍA Okay. So tell me about those three cards. What… what about those cards stood out to you and what feelings come up as you look at them? 

01:46:00
JACKIE So… so in (inaudible), this really reminds Mexico and just being Mexican and… and what that means to me, so that (inaudible), so being Mexican… 

01:46:20
OLGA L. MEJÍA That that identifies you. 

01:46:20
JACKIE That… You know, got it you know. Just being Mexican is always going to be with me and so… 

01:46:30
OLGA L. MEJÍA How does it feel to say that right now? 

01:46:30
JACKIE It feel really good. You know, I'm… I'm very proud to be Mexican and the… I love the culture and it's just, you know, it's beautiful. Umm… So yeah, it feels really good, and I picked it (inaudible) because it just reminds me, umm… you know, a bird is, you know, birds are my favorite animal, you know. And so (inaudible), you know, birds, we have them here and in Mexico. You know, they come back and forth freely. 

01:47:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA (inaudible). 

01:47:10
JACKIE So, you know, it reminds me, it just… it just kind of reminds me that, you know, there is pride in… in being or coming from two different cultures and that, you know, just as birds, you know, they're free to come back and forth, from both of them, and so that's my bird. 

01:47:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA Birds don't need to have their documentation… 

01:47:40
JACKIE Exactly. Yeah, and they can fly over walls, borders. 

01:47:45
OLGA L. MEJÍA They can. There's a lot with walls. 

01:47:50
JACKIE Exactly. And (inaudible), I picked her because she… I guess, it's me, you know, and… 

01:48:00
OLGA L. MEJÍA Tell me about you? 

01:48:05
JACKIE So in… in my struggle to find my… my identity, umm… I guess in wanting to please everyone, then I forget to think about me and you know, like you said earlier, creating my own language and creating my own value system and beliefs that fit for me, so eventually, you know, just like this lady, she looks very confident. Umm… And, you know, that's… that's the goal, you know, to… to just be okay with. Well, what… with what fits for me and… and… and perhaps stop worrying about. You know, (inaudible) too much this or am I too much that and… and be like… Well, this is just me, and that's okay. 

01:48:55
OLGA L. MEJÍA What's it feel like to say that? 

01:49:00
JACKIE It feels… it feels good and but I also know it's a journey, and that, it might take some time to get there. So it makes me think of, you know, maybe everything… my journey, you know, my own journey and what that might look like. And the struggles and the obstacles that I face but knowing that I can get there. 

01:49:25
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. I absolutely hear the beginnings of fighting some balance or finding your balance, right, as you're in kind of embark on this journey, you know and… and thank you for sharing those cards, umm… feel the strength and the uh… the private through the struggle, right and kind of finding your own voice. Umm… Now what I want to say is I definitely hear that on our conversation, I hear that families are important to you and so I think that it's not about, you know, pushing family away, uh… it's more about focusing on what is Jackie want and what does she need and what's gonna make sense for you within the context of family. Because family is important and… and you're important too. So what is it like to talk about loteria with me? 

01:50:20
JACKIE It's pretty cool. I guess I never… I guess I never realized like the emotional connection that comes with these cards, and you know, the meaning behind it, like familiar and… Yeah, I'm just getting all these memories from my childhood, even (inaudible). So it's… it's nice. 

01:50:45
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. Well, thank you for sharing them with me. 

01:50:45
JACKIE Well, thank you. 

01:50:50
[sil.] 

01:51:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So Olga, is this a good example of using Loteria as an intervention? 

01:51:05
OLGA L. MEJÍA I think so. Yeah, this was kind of fun actually. I think and in… in terms of because I know Loteria myself. You know, and that she… and Jackie was open to doing this. I… I'm always kinda curious to see what cards the… the client will choose and kind of what story, and it felt like, umm… given what we had been talking about and kind of her presenting concern in terms of this struggle of identity and, you know, which… how… how Mexican and how American and early on she had kinda talked about some kinda difficult feelings around shame and kinda some difficulty. So it was really nice to see uh… the cards that she chose, you know, that… 

01:51:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. That she chose… 

01:51:50
OLGA L. MEJÍA So she had chosen, I think the first one that she talked about was (inaudible), which is very… it's kind of an iconic part of identifying as Mexican. Right, I think she talked about, you know, (inaudible), that's kind of a… a typical phrase that you hear that if someone… it's having an (inaudible) on your forehead that… that you're… you're really kind of you identify, you present as Mexican. Yeah. And so she had an (inaudible), she had (inaudible), which is uh… and the bird and (inaudible), the woman. And so I felt like the story that she told kind of brought it all together, you know, in terms and kinda the… the feelings and the memories, you know, that she even at that before we started, you know, she talked about Loteria brought back memories of Sunday afternoons after church and with family and how competitive, it seems like even the you get would get uh… with it, but I think beyond that, it really… I think brought some of the struggle, uh… but also brought some of our strengths. I think… 

01:52:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I thought so too. 

01:52:55
OLGA L. MEJÍA She was able to talk about feeling proud and kind of identifying (inaudible). 

01:53:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. As that… as the woman who she wants to be… Right, right. I noticed that… that again, there was no resistance at all when you brought up, she knew what you were talking about… She jump right then and then, when she picked the cards, you kind of asked her to kinda talk about what these cards are presented for her. 

01:53:20
OLGA L. MEJÍA Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I think that she was… Again, I kinda wanna… just because I think it's gonna work for her doesn't mean it… well, so I wanted to ask is this okay, you know, to… to do and to work, but they really seem to fit for her. I also really… because we had talked about immigration, and I really like when she talked about (inaudible) and how that there's birds in Mexico(ph) and there's birds in the US. That I think for me, it was nice to kind of think about, well birds don't need documentation, right. They don't need to worry about the political laws that are in place at the moment or not placed on the moment, and so I thought that… that was very touching for her to talk about. 

01:54:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, it really struck me as we think about kind of what you presented today and we've talked about on the multicultural feminists kind of perspective in worldview. But this really captures so much of that, you know, there's… there's… It's in line with her culture and worldview, something she can relate to… It's quite empowering. Right and there's an image she takes from that as well, empowering image of… of strength. So really just captures a lot of what you've been talking about today. 

01:54:35
OLGA L. MEJÍA And such a nice way, I think it just really kind of brings it all together. And… and it's a, you know, kind of through images, so that it doesn't all have to be verbal, and it really pulls her some really significant discussions. 

01:54:50
