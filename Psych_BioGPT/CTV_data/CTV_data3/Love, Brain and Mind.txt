The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

00:00:00
 Hello. Well, welcome. I am very pleased to introduce Diane Ackerman and Dan Siegel who will be talking about three of my favorite topics, love, the brain, and the mind. So welcome. 

00:00:20
DIANE ACKERMAN Thank you. Well, we were talking, ah, earlier and one thing that I wanted to ask Dan relates to, uhm, something I was talking about yesterday. My husband had a stroke, and all of a sudden a year ago he woke up at one in the morning, he climbed out of bed, and he started painting for the first time in his life at the age of 83. And painted all night, every night, thousands of paintings ever since. And I wondered, how does this happened in the brain that suddenly you become so deeply creative out of the blue even though you've had this terrible trauma that's happened to you? 

00:01:10
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. Well, first, I wanna say it's an honor to be here with you and it's great to see you again in Ana-- Anaheim. 

00:01:15
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes, indeed it is. 

00:01:15
DAN SIEGEL So, uhm, what we're going to do just so we've aren't surprised is, ah, Diane and I decided that we would make this truly interactive. And what that means for us is, uhm, I'll say a little bit, and Diane and I will go over some stuff together. 

00:01:35
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-huh. 

00:01:35
DAN SIEGEL Diane will say a little bit, I'll say a little bit. And then we'll go to different topics. But then we also wanna invite you - 

00:01:40
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:01:40
DAN SIEGEL - to interact as well. So, uhm, we know each other very well so we feel excited about this - 

00:01:50
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:01:50
DAN SIEGEL - kind of format. But it may be different than what you used to. So when you hear Diane interrupt me, you need to know we, we haven't planned it, but we've permitted it. 

00:01:55
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes, ahead of time. 

00:01:55
DAN SIEGEL Cuz we love, cuz we love each other so much. 

00:02:00
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:02:00
DAN SIEGEL If you could please interrupt me, so-- and we're... 

00:02:00
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:02:00
DAN SIEGEL We've kind of demarcated short little bout. So the thing I would respond to you, Diane, about that important question is first of all I wanna say that, uhm, your book, One Hundred Names For Love, is absolutely brilliant. 

00:02:15
DIANE ACKERMAN Thank you. 

00:02:15
DAN SIEGEL And it's such an incredible contribution to everyone. Isn't it amazing to hear about that? 

00:02:20
DIANE ACKERMAN Thank you. 

00:02:20
DAN SIEGEL And the question you're asking about knowing the trauma of the stroke, but how the brain might permit and creates a view. 

00:02:30
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:02:30
DAN SIEGEL And it wasn't the day before. Well, to ask you about if we back up from that very specific question and ask the general question, how does the brain even if it doesn't have a stroke allow creativity to emerge from it? 

00:02:45
DIANE ACKERMAN Oh, well, I think this fits right in with our topic. I think, uhm, really the essence of creativity as far as I'm concerned is paying loving attention to the world, really having a kind of romance with whatever it is that you are going to write about or paint about. Whatever it is, you have to fall in love with it. And in my case, most often I just wake up one day and I discovered that I'm coming down with the book. And, yeah, there was a board meeting of my psyche that happened while I was asleep and a telegram was slipped under the door of my awareness and it said, you know, you have a real crush on, whatever it is. 

00:03:35
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:03:35
DIANE ACKERMAN And indeed to know is profound. And when I say the need to know, I mean to know wholly, body and soul. 

00:03:45
DAN SIEGEL So, so the craze you started with was loving attention? 

00:03:50
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:03:50
DAN SIEGEL And if we took that apart, and I know you love words, so loving attention. What, what is loving attention? 

00:04:00
DIANE ACKERMAN Well, I guess we could do this either way. So we, maybe we hit our sidestep that the - 

00:04:05
DAN SIEGEL Yes. 

00:04:05
DIANE ACKERMAN - idea of somebody who loves attention. We'll - 

00:04:05
DAN SIEGEL Yes, yes. 

00:04:05
DIANE ACKERMAN - we'll pass on that one. Okay. 

00:04:05
DAN SIEGEL All right. All right. No, no, no. 

00:04:10
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. We won't go there. 

00:04:10
DAN SIEGEL I didn't think, I didn't actually think of that until you said it. 

00:04:15
DIANE ACKERMAN Uhm, ah, you know, I think that it's giving something your full attention and I mean opening all of your senses to it. Because after all, we only exist in relation to the world and we can't know the world except through this radar net of our senses. But we don't always allow it to be completely open. We tend to guard ourselves in different kinds of ways. But if you give yourself fully to something, sometimes the, the word is mindfulness, right? 

00:04:50
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:04:50
DIANE ACKERMAN That people use, uhm, and you are just riveted by it body and soul. It fills your heart - 

00:05:00
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:05:00
DIANE ACKERMAN - and there's not room for anything else. 

00:05:00
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. So when you say those things, and this is really, uhm, also to tie this in a bit to psychotherapy, uhm, the word love is something that can sometimes in a therapeutic context get us feeling really nervous. 

00:05:15
DIANE ACKERMAN I'm sure. 

00:05:15
DAN SIEGEL Because of boundary violations. 

00:05:15
DIANE ACKERMAN Yeah. 

00:05:15
DAN SIEGEL And people say you shouldn't be in love with your patient or you follow through in loving fantasies or whatever like that. So we wanna really be careful as we as therapist listen to this dialogue about what that four-letter word means, L-O-V-E, or its variants like loving attention or Jack Kornfield and I used the word loving awareness. 

00:05:40
DIANE ACKERMAN I'm think-- yeah, I'm really using it in the sense of wholeheartedness. 

00:05:40
DAN SIEGEL Yeah. So, so what I wanna, ah, ask you or-- and actually reflect at one for a few minutes, ah, with you about is, uhm, if you think about it from a deep, uhm, sort of noble philosophical way. Uhm, the nervous system addressing at the brain - 

00:06:00
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:06:00
DAN SIEGEL - in the first question is a system of cells streaming throughout the body that allows electrochemical energy transformations to happen. And part of what the human brain does is it comes up with this pattern recognition capacity that the brain is really all about and these patterns become embedded in mental models that start, uhm, screaming what we see and filtering what we see by what we experienced before in a way that ultimately it can be called top-down processing. And as the infant develops into toddler and develops into, ah, elementary school kid, we did to be around six or seven or eight years of age, somewhere around there, this top-down filters start imprisoning our experience in two those visions of a previously experienced reality. And so you-- what you see is divergent thinking, thinking outside the box. 

00:07:05
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:07:05
DAN SIEGEL Starts diving down around this age. You see the willingness to draw, literally to draw and paint. It dives down around this age. You see the kids who might have had a, a love of dancing start getting nervous about dancing. They won't claim music cuz they think only musicians play music. And this idea of creativity of, of ex-- if we define creativity as the, uhm, the allowing to emerge within your experience, new combinations - 

00:07:40
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:07:40
DAN SIEGEL - that... 

00:07:40
DIANE ACKERMAN Of seemingly unrelated things. 

00:07:40
DAN SIEGEL Of seemingly unrelated things or, or, or new combinations of all the... 

00:07:45
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:07:45
DAN SIEGEL Of familiar things, in either way. 

00:07:50
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:07:50
DAN SIEGEL But, but you're allowing yourself to emerge in this and that we lose that creativity as we pass through elementary school. And then when we're smashed into the ri-- rigidified world of middle school, and high school, most of us, out to gonna have it for you, but from most of us, for me for sure, you are given instructions, external instructions, on how to be. And the brain loves to soak that in and it comes up with the couple of delusions. 

00:08:15
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:08:20
DAN SIEGEL One delusion is that the word self, S-E-L-F, is limited by your skin. And you come to believe that the self like these two selves or these three selves is actually separate, that the self is separate. And then you come to believe that these mental models that you can even see but they filter everything are actually the same as truth. So what I wanna invite you to think about is for poll that there are things that happened, trauma, psychological trauma - 

00:08:55
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:08:55
DAN SIEGEL - strokes, also the things that can actually disrupt mental model configurations in the brain. 

00:09:00
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:09:00
DAN SIEGEL And actually deliberate us to realize that the old mental models built by these electrochemical transformation processes in the brain are actually now disrupted. 

00:09:15
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:09:15
DAN SIEGEL And that allowing new combinations to emerge in a way that honors authentic beam which I think is one part of what we're saying love is - 

00:09:25
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:09:25
DAN SIEGEL - to be in deeply, deeply focusing on it is, ah, is actually a natural outcome sometimes. Now, obviously, some strokes can block that, but that it's... 

00:09:35
DIANE ACKERMAN But it's, it's really quite surprising how many people have told me that they've seen this happen also. So clearly, this can happen. Another way that, that that takes place is just this paradox of habit. We want habit. You know, we want to become masterful enough that we can slur right over all of the details and be able to do things very quickly, get to places very quickly, uhm, otherwise we would just drown in receive sensations all the time. But the minute you do that, you lose the innocence that you first had when you were learning about all of those kinds of things. 

00:10:15
DAN SIEGEL You mean, cuz you're just-- when you say habit, you're sticking with the familiar root that's created but that you can do it. 

00:10:20
DIANE ACKERMAN Exactly. Yes. What-- or you can, ah, apply it to almost anything, driving to work. There can also be habitual ways of being with the partner. Uhm, anything that you, you turn into a kind of short-hand, and I think we do this automatically, it's, it's one of the ways that we manage to waive through this sea of sensations - 

00:10:45
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:10:45
DIANE ACKERMAN - that we're in. And it's a terrific thing that we've learned how to do this. Otherwise, if you had to think about driving every little aspect ever that you'd never manage it. But on the other hand, it's deadening. Uhm, and finding a way to break that apart and see things freshly, that is really the challenge. I think it's a challenge in love and in relationships, uhm, to be able to continue to find refreshing new elements in your relationship. 

00:11:20
DAN SIEGEL Yeah, yeah. 

00:11:20
DIANE ACKERMAN But also in, in just in terms of seeing the world in a creative way. 

00:11:25
DAN SIEGEL Right. 

00:11:25
DIANE ACKERMAN Seeing familiar things. 

00:11:25
DAN SIEGEL So, so let me, let me ask you, Diane, and as to get one to think about this, like, picture this. This, this body has now come over here to this side of this stage and if you think about in Ellen and Diane or the nervous system and I'm some kind of streaming energy of vision or sound or something coming in, I now gonna come into this nervous system and the fresh way, what, what we would call bottom up would be I enter this nervous system, and as I come in through let's say the eyes and I come here and I'm here and I'm entering let's say the cortex, then this stream of light energy is gonna be experienced as if it was never experienced before. 

00:12:20
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:12:20
DAN SIEGEL We call that bottom up. That's just the phrase you can use. Bottom up. It's a-- there are different ways of using bottom up and top-down but this is one legitimate way. So this bottom up experience, you feel the freshness of it. Uhm, however, what usually happens, what Diane is I think you're talking about is something comes in, you're busy because you have to go to the market, you have to get something, and the light comes in, it's from a flower, right, growing on the edge of a curb that you're stepping over cuz you have to hurry up and get your milk, to hurry up and get back cuz you have a phone call you have to do and you have to hurry up and make dinner. And so there's light comes in from the flower and it's quickly showered you know over here and you're just straight on saying, "Oh, yeah, I have to get the milk, I have to get the Scottish cheese, I have to go get some, some things like that, and you're busy and you've missed the flower. And you have a mental model in your mind before you go shopping - 

00:13:10
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:13:15
DAN SIEGEL - that completely makes you miss the bottom up because the top-down has created what you're saying is the path, the routine, to get to the store and make sure actually not be lied. It's, it's a vulnerability of the human brain that means that a practice that can reverse it, like mindfulness. I think that was... 

00:13:30
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm, yes. 

00:13:35
DAN SIEGEL Uhm, isn't just for people with "psychological disturbances," it's actually for any human being. And may be those are the same, I don't know. But, ah, you know, it's for any human being who, who, who, who, uhm, is living with the human brain. 

00:13:50
DIANE ACKERMAN Absolutely. And once, and once to lead a more creative life, and a fresher life, or who wants to be 11 again. 

00:14:00
DAN SIEGEL So creativity doesn't have to mean you're writing poetry or painting paintings or writing books. It can mean a way of living, or it's a way of being. 

00:14:10
DIANE ACKERMAN It is a way-- I think it's-- that's right. I think that most of what I do is just pay attention. 

00:14:15
DAN SIEGEL In a certain kind of way. 

00:14:15
DIANE ACKERMAN In a certain kind of way. That's right. 

00:14:20
DAN SIEGEL Which is, which is how? 

00:14:20
DIANE ACKERMAN Which is giving something, ah, my full of attention. So for example, it would be tempting the way we are just talking about. We have our senses out there. They're filtering things. You know, there's-- if, if you allow yourself, the everythingness of everything reminds you of the everythingness of everything else. And you're just pulled. Yes. Just pulled in all different kinds of directions. But to be able to look at something with wonder and marvel in that kind of gee whiz, oh my god, here we are that the sky is blue. But just beyond the blue, there is space and we are on this planet in space. And once very long ago life happen on this planet. And through all sorts of curious twists and turns going through everything from prom dresses, you know, to sitting here having a conference today, we are here. If you... 

00:15:20
DAN SIEGEL A miracle. 

00:15:20
DIANE ACKERMAN It's a miracle. It's an absolute miracle. And as with love, if you let, ah, wonder fill your mind. I think it's very bulky and you can't fit anything else in. 

00:15:30
DAN SIEGEL Wonder? 

00:15:30
DIANE ACKERMAN Yeah. 

00:15:35
DAN SIEGEL What would you mean-- what do you mean it's bulky? 

00:15:35
DIANE ACKERMAN I mean that if you feel a strong sense of wonder, you can't be also worrying about something. 

00:15:40
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:15:45
DIANE ACKERMAN Or wondering, ah, if you remembered to turn off the, uhm, the alarm on the house or if you-- you know, where you're going for dinner. Anything else, it completely occupies the, the mental space that you have. And when something occupies our space like that, it's a form of rupture. 

00:16:05
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. So, so inside of me when you say that is, ah, the following cascade of, ah, re-- reflections. 

00:16:15
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-huh. 

00:16:15
DAN SIEGEL One is, uhm, the wonder you're describing has this luminous quality to it, this illuminating quality to it and this opening quality to it. 

00:16:30
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:16:30
DAN SIEGEL Uhm, whereas going quickly shopping, you, you need-- it's got this close down quality to it. And in the field that I come from, interpersonal neurobiology, we've tried to create this framework that's based on all the different sciences. 

00:16:45
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:16:45
DAN SIEGEL And in doing that, this one process called integration has emerged - 

00:16:50
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-huh. 

00:16:50
DAN SIEGEL - that seems to be connected to different things like health, and I think in creativity and love. 

00:16:55
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

00:17:00
DAN SIEGEL And so I wanna just give you this sort of take on what you're saying which is that the rupture of a close paying of attention, that's not filtered by this top-down schema - 

00:17:15
DIANE ACKERMAN And nonjudgmental. 

00:17:15
DAN SIEGEL - and it's nonjudgmental, uhm, allows you to take in things as they are. 

00:17:20
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:17:20
DAN SIEGEL Allow new combinations to emerge without worry or fret that you're saying and to kind of be, ah, be deeply great for it, to be in ruptured by the easiness of things, the suchness of things. Let's call it the ipseity. 

00:17:35
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:17:35
DAN SIEGEL And in that ipsiety that the way things are, uhm, for me as a, you know, interpersonal neurobiology person, we would see that as living a life that's optimizing integration. 

00:17:50
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:17:50
DAN SIEGEL And that-- and if you see the mind-- as we're talking about love, mind, and brain, if you do make a statement that the mind is the process of self-organization - 

00:18:00
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:18:00
DAN SIEGEL - that arises both in your relationships like between me and you right now, and within your body like through your nervous system including your brain, and this self-organizational process is regulating energy information flow, the way this flow will have the, uhm, optimal harmony, if you will, let's call it maximizing complexity as this quality of harmony to it will be when you're allowing differentiation of elements and then linking them. 

00:18:30
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:18:30
DAN SIEGEL And in this bottom of flow, let's say, we've talked about the mind, we've talked about the brain, now we talk about love, if you look at how you're describing love, of being in love with life - 

00:18:45
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:18:45
DAN SIEGEL - it's optimizing the way you're allowing different new experiences to be differentiated and not constraining them by past mental models of the top-down filters. 

00:18:55
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:18:55
DAN SIEGEL That kind of love. If you're talking about love let's say between me and you - 

00:18:55
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:19:00
DAN SIEGEL - as, uhm - 

00:19:00
DIANE ACKERMAN Siblings. 

00:19:00
DAN SIEGEL - as siblings. Yes. We call each other siblings. 

00:19:00
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes, we do. 

00:19:00
DAN SIEGEL Uhm, that's how we always write each other to. 

00:19:05
DIANE ACKERMAN Dan sib, Diane sib. 

00:19:05
DAN SIEGEL Yes. So as siblings, the love I feel for you is filled with the sense that you have your differentiated life, I have my differentiated life, and whenever we can we link together in all sorts of ways. Ah... 

00:19:20
DIANE ACKERMAN And pick up the conversation where we left. 

00:19:20
DAN SIEGEL Where we left it off. And it's a profoundly integrative relationship for me full of love. Yeah. 

00:19:25
DIANE ACKERMAN Me, too. And let me add something about that. Uhm, from my perspective, the reason that I love Dan so much is that he seems to me and did immediately when we met like a part of myself that under other circumstances it, it-- that was the path I could have followed. Ah, if I wasn't going to be a poet, I could easily have been a neuroscientist. But he's doing that for me. And if I allow that part of myself to be open to him, then my whole sense of life is much richer because he is fulfilling that part for me. 

00:20:05
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:20:05
DIANE ACKERMAN That I would have pursued. 

00:20:05
DAN SIEGEL And there's, ah, there's such a beautiful thing in the way you're saying and I, I, I think-- we'll share with you just this moment when we met. I mean, besides meeting alone for breakfast before. 

00:20:15
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:20:15
DAN SIEGEL But Rich Simon who runs the Psychotherapy Networker have this vision that Diane and I should meet with Jon Kabat-Zinn. And I brought along a friend of mine named John O'Donoghue - 

00:20:30
DIANE ACKERMAN Yeah. 

00:20:30
DAN SIEGEL - to also be a part of the Networker. And when the four of us met, it was like this massive love fest. 

00:20:35
DIANE ACKERMAN Be... 

00:20:35
DAN SIEGEL It was-- ah, ah, and, and we're, we're talking about love that's why we're bothering talking about this personal stuff. But in terms of that kind of love, cuz we're not talking about romantic love - 

00:20:45
DIANE ACKERMAN Right. 

00:20:45
DAN SIEGEL - we're not talking about sexual love, we're talking about just the love of deep honoring relationships which is the very important place to start with especially cuz we're psychotherapists. And it's okay to use the idea that you love your clients. Somebody would argue in fact that you have this kind of love for your client, how is your client gonna get better? You know, you deeply honor the difference. You deeply respect the person. And you're adding a different element which is I think we all felt like we could have been the other if we have pursued that path. 

00:21:10
DIANE ACKERMAN Exactly as well. Yeah. 

00:21:15
DAN SIEGEL Uhm, when the four of us did, ah, an event called Mind and Moment, it was a three-day conference we did, it was amazing and we recorded and everyone was excited about, and that sadly of the four of us, uhm, John O'Donoghue, and I don't wanna shock any of you on notice. 

00:21:30
DIANE ACKERMAN Yeah. 

00:21:30
DAN SIEGEL But John passed away. And it was like a part of us absolutely died. 

00:21:30
DIANE ACKERMAN Exactly, yeah. 

00:21:35
DAN SIEGEL And when the three of us got on the phone and talked about it, it was-- ah, it was literally like being yanked apart that was horrible. 

00:21:40
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:21:40
DAN SIEGEL Uhm, it's kind of a bomb to talk about but anyway-- but it's-- but that's a part of life, you know. 

00:21:45
DIANE ACKERMAN Yeah. 

00:21:45
DAN SIEGEL It's, it's death and, and those same thing. So this kind of love, I guess, the-- what I wanna say about this in terms of we're going from creativity to love, that, that the feeling that I think we're trying to get at is that if you take a place in life of making yourself really, really open, of honoring where you are in your life, where you'd been, where you are now, where you're going, and letting yourself really take in another person - 

00:22:20
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:22:20
DAN SIEGEL - uhm, the feeling of that is love. The mechanism of that, or how do you consider it from a scientific point of view, is integration. And so I had the honor of, uhm, reading recently in, a, a, a book that if you don't know about it, it's a beautiful book, I mean besides, ah, One Hundred Names for Love which is a book with love in the title. Another book with love in the title-- ah, ah, have any of you read Love 2.0? Oh, okay. Well, let me tell you about it. It's by Barbara Fredrickson. And when I read it, I was kind of blown away because Barbara Fredrickson is a, a person in that state, initially in positive psychology. And her view of love is something called positivity resonance. And in the book I wrote, the Developing Mind, the second edition, I talk about Barbara Fredrickson's really important work on looking at this, uhm, broad and build aspect of positive emotions from-- in a personal mo-- neurobiology point of view, we actually look at positive emotions like love, uhm, as states of increased integration. Whereas the so-called negative emotions are decreased integration. And we define integration as a shifting integration. We define emotion as a shifting integration. So in Barbara's book, what she says is love is not just what happens in a romance, it's not just what happens between children and their parents, it's actually something that can be deeply understood in her view as sharing positive states. I asked her cuz we had dinner the, the other night together, uhm, and, and I, I said, "Would you be open embracing the idea that it's sharing all states?" And she was, she was really open to that. 

00:24:05
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:24:05
DAN SIEGEL But in the initial research, it was sharing these positive states. Now what that means is for us as therapists that the work we do is to sit with clients deeply allowed and to be differentiated from us. So we don't become them even though we have these things called mirror around. We don't become them, otherwise we'll burn out. We differentiate from them. But we link with them with deep empathy and deep compassion and in that resonating, not only with the positive states but the painful states, that's essentially a loving relationship in larger way to Barbara Fredrickson's beautifully defining. And when you think about it that way, now, now we're covering lo-- we're covering love, mind, and brain, what we're saying is that you have the ability as a therapist to sense how your own mind is functioning to I think create in your brain this integrative states that literally allow you to participate as a therapist in cultivating more integration with your clients. That ultimately is about this huge, huge love. It's this huge way of increasing integration. And that also relates to the question about creativity. I think it's a natural push for a nervous system to actually explore the world, and what happens is not that creativity is special, I think it is imprisoned by the kind of lives people live - 

00:25:40
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:25:40
DAN SIEGEL - and it's really more a matter of liberating it for ourselves and our clients. 

00:25:45
DIANE ACKERMAN Yeah. I was, ah, just thinking a lit-- a little bit earlier today about how old love is. You know, you were talking about different forms of love. But also love has been critically important for us as species. You know, if you think about what we must have been like that we required an emotion like love to evolve, we must have been so warlike, so tempestuous, so unbridled that there was no way for us to survive. And so something like love had to evolve for us to be able to get on with one another and have offspring and be able to raise them. And if you look at the oldest writings of our time that we still have, the Egyptian hieroglyphic love poems, they talk about love exactly the same thing we do today. 

00:26:35
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:26:35
DIANE ACKERMAN You know, it's that ancient, a delirium and I love thinking that it connects us to everyone who ever lived, to everyone whoever will live, ah, it's the single emotion that we share. 

00:26:50
DAN SIEGEL So what-- can you say more about why you think we had to be so feisty that we needed love to counteract the feistiness rather than it being like what we talked about earlier in the day about power parenting that, that we have this, that's already talks about the sharing child wearing so we have that-- this feeling that connected us to others even our-- not our own offspring but an offspring the way to take care of. But what remains is the thing you had to come from a-- you know, a warlike ancestor? 

00:27:25
DIANE ACKERMAN Because love is such an extreme emotion. I mean, it's an extremely wonderful emotion but it's an all consuming emotion. And, uhm, if you just kind of stop and look at it... 

00:27:40
DAN SIEGEL Excuse me. I'm about to cough too much. 

00:27:40
DIANE ACKERMAN All right. Uhm... 

00:27:45
DAN SIEGEL You want some? 

00:27:45
DIANE ACKERMAN No, thank you. I was gonna just say that love is a, is a very unusual predicament for matter to get into. You know, here we are supposedly mere matter, nothing mere about us, and this arrangement of matter got into this predicament that we call love. I find that just astonishing, absolutely astonishing. You can see that if you, you know, allow yourself to be astonished by this for too long, you, you just inert, and it's tempting. But it must have been that we were yes very feisty, yes very warlike, and not able to be so caring, so obsessed in all the good ways that we were able to be devoted to mates long enough to feel the kind of love that we feel for children, ah, get them on the ground and able to follow with the tribe and all of those kinds of things. I think we would not have survived as species if we hadn't. And there were times, yes, when there, there was like a genetic battlement and there were very of us left on the planet, maybe 1,000 or something like that. And who knows what happened at that point? I wonder if that's when something like this very intense feeling that we call love, whether it's platonic love or romantic love or whatever it is, and that we treasure in this metaphorical way as being something high. Everything that's high, we think that is good. 

00:29:35
DAN SIEGEL Well, well, well let's-- so let's look at some of the science of that. Uhm, Helen Fisher writes about three kinds of love. 

00:29:45
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:29:45
DAN SIEGEL She writes about the love we have, attachment love - 

00:29:50
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:29:50
DAN SIEGEL - where we as mammals will take care of our young. And even as we get older, if we're friends, uhm, and I'm in distress, I would call you up - 

00:30:00
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:30:00
DAN SIEGEL - and you'd be my attachment figuring you'd soothe me. 

00:30:00
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:30:00
DAN SIEGEL You'd be seeing me. 

00:30:00
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:30:00
DAN SIEGEL I'd be safe with you so I feel secure. Those are four essence of attachment. 

00:30:05
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:30:10
DAN SIEGEL Then she talks about romantic love. 

00:30:10
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:30:10
DAN SIEGEL Ah, related to the dopamine system - 

00:30:10
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:30:15
DAN SIEGEL - where I become addicted to you. 

00:30:15
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-huh. 

00:30:15
DAN SIEGEL And, and I couldn't be without you. And then when I'm with-- away from you, I long for you. 

00:30:20
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:30:20
DAN SIEGEL You know, all things that poets write about and some writers write about. 

00:30:20
DIANE ACKERMAN Right. 

00:30:25
DAN SIEGEL So that would be romantic love. And then there's sexual love - 

00:30:25
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:30:25
DAN SIEGEL - where you feel erotic arousal and you wanna satisfy that with sexual engagement. 

00:30:30
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:30:30
DAN SIEGEL Ah, it's very satisfying. And there are different hormonal systems on the parts of the brain. 

00:30:35
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:30:35
DAN SIEGEL And according to Helen Fisher that you can have a relationship with any number of the combinations of that. You'll just have an attachment relation, that attachment relation with romance, those sexual... 

00:30:45
DIANE ACKERMAN Right. 

00:30:45
DAN SIEGEL We have all three and you have the jackpot. You know, uhm, ah, but you're in describing like a larger issue of being in love with life which is... 

00:30:55
DIANE ACKERMAN I think-- don't you think that there are all of this different versions of love? Uhm, and I don't know that one is stronger than the other. I think there are just different facets of the diamond. 

00:31:10
DAN SIEGEL But how, how do you relate that to, uhm... 

00:31:10
DIANE ACKERMAN But in each case - 

00:31:15
DAN SIEGEL It's the-- yeah. 

00:31:15
DIANE ACKERMAN - it's the kind of wholeheartedness. 

00:31:15
DAN SIEGEL Yeah. Well let, let me describe something. I don't think I've ever said this publicly and maybe ever to someone, but I'll just tell you, I used to have this experience when I was younger like around 17 or 18, uhm, of missing the present moment. 

00:31:30
DIANE ACKERMAN Oh. 

00:31:30
DAN SIEGEL I, I call the nostalgia for the present. 

00:31:35
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-huh. 

00:31:35
DAN SIEGEL Like I was so-- does anybody ever had that experience? Everyone's not in here. 

00:31:40
DIANE ACKERMAN Yeah. 

00:31:40
DAN SIEGEL Like-- maybe that's we-- why we all became therapists. Like I would sit in the present moment and I would be like thinking so much. I would say, "Why can I just like be here?" 

00:31:45
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-huh. 

00:31:45
DAN SIEGEL And I would like miss being here, you know. 

00:31:50
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:31:50
DAN SIEGEL And then it wasn't until like years and years later, uhm, to the series of things where-- it's a long story but the, the, the end point is we decided to create a mind from the center in UCLA so we brought in, uhm, a mindfulness teacher. 

00:32:05
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-huh. 

00:32:05
DAN SIEGEL Uhm, and the first time I've ever meditated was just a few years ago. And so he has this meditate grade, and we do just the simple breath practice that we did at the beginning, in, in the workshop this morning after the breath practice the wheel awareness so you do just focus on the breath and then now get distracted but turns to the breath. You're always in the present form of the breath. And then we took a break and we went down for lunch. And, uhm, so everyone ordered food and everyone was chatting about university of politics and stuff and their sound was like, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa inside of me and the waitress, ah, delivers this thing-- like, in front of me, it was like, this sort of like have this shape and have this like colors emanating from it with all this different kind of textures - 

00:32:55
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:32:55
DAN SIEGEL - and surfaces. So I like, was looking at this thing and I was like giggling. And I then, I like, took this, this silvery cold thing and I picked it up and I like, inserted it in one of the color subjects. And then I picked it up and it was like this unbelievable like color everything and I smelled it and have this incredible aroma and I put it in my mouth. And then as I close my jaws around it, there's like liquid stuff like, it's-- it was all over my mouth and I just started to like, laugh in it. 

00:33:35
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes, the poet in you came out. 

00:33:35
DAN SIEGEL Well, I guess, but it was, it was amazing and, and everyone was trying to talking about university of politics and I just went like this to them and I said, no, no. And I kept on doing this thing or this thing. So then when we went up, we went up, we went up to... 

00:33:45
DIANE ACKERMAN And they didn't think you had like dropped asset. 

00:33:50
DAN SIEGEL No. See, see, that's interesting. I'd never done anything like that. 

00:33:50
DIANE ACKERMAN Yeah. 

00:33:50
DAN SIEGEL They're all sorts of family but I don't do that and never done it. But people who have done it, tell me that's exactly what it was like. And it was so interesting to me because it was just a one-time meditation that did it. So then when we got up there with the meditation teacher, he said, you know, what, what is meditation and I just started laughing. I said, I don't know but it's really good. But in, in, in... 

00:34:15
DIANE ACKERMAN But those are also-- that is also a creativity exercise. 

00:34:15
DAN SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:34:15
DIANE ACKERMAN I mean, you know, pretend that I-- you can take absolutely anything, a sponge or a pencil, whatever. And just pretend that you are crawling along it, ah, with your eyes, with your pens, what are you experiencing at every step of the way. Or if it were in-- if you were gonna do something with it other than what it's intended for, what would you be using it for? 

00:34:45
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:34:45
DIANE ACKERMAN And things like that. But it all has to do with that waking up, suddenly just smacking yourself away. And as you say saying, "Oh my gosh, I'd missed this incredibly important moment that will never come again." 

00:35:00
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:35:05
DIANE ACKERMAN And it was a very full moment. It was incredibly rich. What was in it? We treasure the values. 

00:35:10
DAN SIEGEL And that awakening of the mind is actually something you can train your self to do. It isn't just like you have to do one thing or the other. But there are lots of ways to doing that. And what I've found, the more I do this formal practice of this wheel of awareness which is - 

00:35:25
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:35:25
DAN SIEGEL - which is very much making life to have that texture of the salad being always in colors and everything like that. Uhm, the more I feel love everyday, it's kind of-- it was a shock. I mean, not just from my family member, my wife and... 

00:35:35
DIANE ACKERMAN Yeah. 

00:35:40
DAN SIEGEL But just in general. I mean, it's-- ah, cuz no one told me that was what the side effect would be, ah, becoming more, ah, reflective as you've actually become more out work - 

00:35:50
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:35:50
DAN SIEGEL - and more feeling connected to the world. 

00:35:50
DIANE ACKERMAN You wouldn't think that it would be that way, would you? You'd think that you would be more locked into yourself, but I feel-- I, I find exactly the same thing you do that the more present that I am, and I would call it present. 

00:36:05
DAN SIEGEL Yes. Absolutely. 

00:36:05
DIANE ACKERMAN Uhm, ah, then it flows over in some way. It doesn't just stop automatically. You can't turn that kind of intensity off. And it flows over into the relationship. And if you can find a way to be present like that in the relationship, it defuses so many of the critical, resentful, judgmental sorts of things that can creep in. 

00:36:35
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:36:35
DIANE ACKERMAN Don't you find that? 

00:36:35
DAN SIEGEL Totally. You know, from a, from a, a science point of view, I would interpret that as presence hugely allows higher states of integration to emerge. 

00:36:45
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:36:50
DAN SIEGEL You know, within presents, it's interesting someone asked that the last little meaning we had about what, uhm, Ger-- no, ah, ah, was it Michael Gazzaniga or was it Gerald-- who is talking about reentry? Was that Edelman or was that Gazzaniga? Edelman. So, so the reentry, the entry view of consciousness - 

00:37:10
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:37:10
DAN SIEGEL - is that, uhm, you have this-- in terms of the brain, you have these circuits in the brain which reenter and they're firing kind of to reinforce the varying firing pattern. And in the work that Edelman and Tononi have done in a book, ah, with consciousness in the name-- I can't remember the formal title, but their proposal which fits exactly this idea of integration is that states have consciousness of which presence of course is a huge one. 

00:37:35
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:37:35
DAN SIEGEL Cuz when, when we're talking about presence, we're talking about you've stabilized consciousness of the present moment incoming stimuli enough so you can hold it there without getting distracted by things from the past and worries about the future, right? 

00:37:50
DIANE ACKERMAN Yeah. 

00:37:50
DAN SIEGEL So in the Edelman and Tononi work that Edelman described about reentry in, in his view, uhm, you have this beautiful notion of how the brain is recursively, that means re-- reinforcingly in a reentry loop way as in, in creating this neuron firing patterns that then stabilize their own existence. 

00:38:15
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:38:15
DAN SIEGEL So that consciousness becomes crucial in psychotherapy. Ah, and really our kind of entry to love because consciousness is this reentry process that stabilizes the firing pattern. Let's say, in, in the moment right here as now we are willing as you and I decided to do - 

00:38:35
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:38:35
DAN SIEGEL - to give it back and forth. 

00:38:35
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-huh. 

00:38:35
DAN SIEGEL So you need to be present for me and I need to be present for you. 

00:38:40
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:38:40
DAN SIEGEL And we don't know what's gonna arise. 

00:38:40
DIANE ACKERMAN Right. 

00:38:40
DAN SIEGEL So we're just here. And in that consciousness of reentry into your brain and my brain and probably our collective mind, you'd see this reentry process so I'm picking up Diane's signals, her body language, her eye contact, her facial expressions, her tone of voice, her posture, her gestures, everything, and I'm soaking that into me and I've got to be really open to whatever is gonna arise. I can't have a preexisting notion of where we suppose to go. I know we have a title to our talk - 

00:39:10
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:39:10
DAN SIEGEL - but it's got to have this presence to it. 

00:39:10
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:39:10
DAN SIEGEL From Edelman's point of view, there would be a huge amount of reentry in Diane's brain, a huge amount of reentry in my brain that stabilizes configuration. And then Ed Tronick's work, you'd see what he calls a dyadic state of consciousness which raises the level of complexity which-- in integration terms, it raises the level of integration that the sum is the whole is greater than the sum of these parts. That's what integration allows. So in that moment then, if we're in therapy or if we're just here doing this, then we get this incredible feeling that I and you or we - 

00:39:50
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:39:50
DAN SIEGEL - which is love - 

00:39:50
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-huh. 

00:39:50
DAN SIEGEL - that I knew as we have created something neither of us could create by ourselves alone - 

00:40:00
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:40:00
DAN SIEGEL - and that we are now participating in this emergent unfolding of now that has this electricity to it that we don't know. So I don't have this for you guys but it feels pretty good, I hope you're okay. Right? 

00:40:15
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. That makes perfectly good sense to me. Uhm, yes. 

00:40:20
DAN SIEGEL Yes. So I bring in the brain stuff because, uhm, you know, we're talking about-- I keep on going and making sure love, their mind, the brain, you know, I, I feel that a lot of clients I see have never been given this permission to be present. And they come to us with rigidity or chaos as their legacy. 

00:40:40
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:40:40
DAN SIEGEL They come imprisoned by all sorts of brain patterns. And in many ways and this, and this sound odd, but what we need to say this mental health group here that the brain has been running the show. What we do is mental health professionals is we use our relationship, the sharing of energy information following this dyadic states of consciousness to actually allow the mind that emerges together to get the brain of actually both people to change. That's what we do. 

00:41:15
DIANE ACKERMAN To allow the-- ah, but to have someone be present, it takes a terrible risk. 

00:41:25
DAN SIEGEL Huge risk. 

00:41:25
DIANE ACKERMAN Because for the most part, don't you think we spend a lot of our lives raising away from the path not wanting to be that vulnerable that you could be present with someone. 

00:41:35
DAN SIEGEL Why is that, why is that more vulnerable? 

00:41:40
DIANE ACKERMAN Because the minute you slow down, somebody, ah, sneak up on you, you know, and they could kill you, they could hurt you. 

00:41:45
DAN SIEGEL So predicting what is going to happen in the future requires you rely on your models from the past - 

00:41:55
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:41:55
DAN SIEGEL - that lock you into a safety schema. Those same... 

00:42:00
DIANE ACKERMAN And some of the models, yes, and some of the models from the past could be quite instinctive. 

00:42:05
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:42:05
DIANE ACKERMAN You know, I mean, we have these eyes right in front so we know that we're predators, right? And, uhm, but to some extent we were also the prey animals. And it makes very good sense to me that we would retain some of that terror - 

00:42:20
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:42:25
DIANE ACKERMAN - of being still for any too long period of time of trusting somebody right up close to you physically or emotionally where they could injure you. 

00:42:35
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. So in many ways, the, the present moment is exactly about embracing uncertainty. 

00:42:50
DIANE ACKERMAN And being just larval naked. 

00:42:50
DAN SIEGEL Larval naked. 

00:42:55
DIANE ACKERMAN You know, you are just, you are just the naked ape there in the sun - 

00:43:00
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:43:00
DIANE ACKERMAN - and, uhm, you're being incredibly vulnerable in that time. But when you are, suddenly you pick up all the different sounds of the cicadas, ah, or if you are of a Buddhist frame of mind, uhm, and you've seen the mandalas, it's the same sound, you know, when they're scraping the sand. 

00:43:20
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:43:20
DIANE ACKERMAN That's cicada's sound. Uhm, and you're watching the way the light, ah, of course, over the grass and so on or how the wind is brushing down the nap of the, the grass and, and all of these different things and they feel you with some kind of incontestable joy. 

00:43:40
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:43:40
DIANE ACKERMAN Because in that moment you are safe, you are vulnerable. 

00:43:45
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:43:45
DIANE ACKERMAN If there is someone with you, even better. 

00:43:50
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:43:50
DIANE ACKERMAN But you know, you were saying, ah, being, uhm, fully present and integrated, ah, with yourself, with your client, but the with yourself part, that's got to be one of the toughest ones when people come to you in therapy. 

00:44:10
DAN SIEGEL Yeah, I'm giving-- for one second, I'm getting a bunch of feedback-- are you guys hearing it? Yeah. 

00:44:15
DIANE ACKERMAN Yeah. 

00:44:15
DAN SIEGEL So I don't know if our audio guy can help us with that. I'm, I'm feeling like we're about to expand in ways you don't wanna expand. Uhm, so maybe if I put this-- is that better? 

00:44:30
DIANE ACKERMAN You, you vanished. 

00:44:30
DAN SIEGEL No. I vanished. 

00:44:35
DIANE ACKERMAN Yeah. 

00:44:35
DAN SIEGEL Is this off now? I think they're redoing my-- is that better? Okay. Thank you, wherever you are. Where are you? Let-- anyway, thank you. Thank you. All right, well, thank you. Well... 

00:44:50
DIANE ACKERMAN I mean, coming to terms with your secret society of selves. 

00:44:50
DAN SIEGEL Yeah. Well, yeah, it is, is it our-- let me, let me share with you two, two things and I wanna get to that. 

00:44:55
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-huh. 

00:44:55
DAN SIEGEL Ah, you know, uhm, Jack Kornfield and I, ah, ah, do this thing, uhm, where we do a two-day thing where we teach people to reflect in different ways. In Seattle, we had some people who have from the you know, world out there. And what wasn't engineered and never meditated for to the days in life, we did the wheel of awareness with him, uhm, which is this practice where you have the hub of this wheel is the sense of knowing and the rim is that which can be known. 

00:45:25
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:45:25
DAN SIEGEL And we allow you to go around the rim to experience sight and sound and taste and touch and smell and the interior of the body, the mental life and your connections to others. 

00:45:35
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:45:35
DAN SIEGEL Fine. And then we bend this spoke of attention rather than being on the, on the rim. We bend it around to go in the hub. 

00:45:40
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-huh. 

00:45:40
DAN SIEGEL So it's the whole practice basically. And we took a break and this engineer went out into the outside we were kind of in a park and he comes back and then we have a discussion, he takes the microphone and he goes, "I absolutely need to talk to everyone." So we go, okay, and he goes, "I've never had this experience before in my life and I don't know what you did to me." And with all, it's us. And he goes, "I walked outside, and I saw this man who was a gardener spraying water over the grass. I saw birds nearby flying in the flowers. I saw the flowers coming out and I realized it's all me. It's all me." And they starts to cry. 

00:46:30
DIANE ACKERMAN Yeah. 

00:46:35
DAN SIEGEL And he says, "I am-- I'd never been so filled with love before." 

00:46:35
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:46:40
DAN SIEGEL What happened? What happened? And we spent the rest of the time kind of talking about that. And I bring that up because I've been fascinated with this real practice. We've had a lot of people do it and I get a lot of feedback about it. And one of the things that I write about is that if you look at the mind as this process that is emerging from and also organizing-- self-organizing energy flow. 

00:47:00
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:47:05
DAN SIEGEL And if you look at the way physicist talk about energy, they talk about it as a probability curve between certainty and uncertainty. 

00:47:10
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:47:15
DAN SIEGEL And it turns your question to the clients that come and see us. So often people live frozen on the certainty into the spectrum because it's safe, it's predictable even if it's trauma based. 

00:47:25
DIANE ACKERMAN Yeah. 

00:47:25
DAN SIEGEL And to drop that energy probability curve toward uncertainty which is basically moving toward the hub of this wheel requires this kind of sense of safety, uhm, that we try to create in the practice. Uhm, but when you go there, then in the hub the illusion that you're separate from the whole world dissolves the way. And for this man, that's what I told them. 

00:47:50
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:47:50
DAN SIEGEL Even though he'd never made it to be forever. He had this experience and for me, the, the will of practice allowed him to drop his energy curve into this hub where it's uncertainty. And then come to experience the interconnected nature of everything without it being a delusion, without it being-- you know, it wasn't taking a pill, it was just the practice of the mind. And when you're talking about when clients come to you afraid to be with their own mind - 

00:48:20
DIANE ACKERMAN Yeah. 

00:48:20
DAN SIEGEL - what comes to my mind is, yes, there are things on the rim, traumatic experiences, feeling rejected, things that never happen to you, that's in terms of attachment terms - 

00:48:30
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:48:35
DAN SIEGEL - that you can develop a sense of shame, feeling bad about it or, or you can divide yourself up with the multiple sense of self. 

00:48:40
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:48:40
DAN SIEGEL Self-states. You can have all sorts of feelings that are so uncomfortable. If you bring them into awareness, you become dysfunctional for it calls those defenses. 

00:48:50
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-huh. 

00:48:50
DAN SIEGEL You can call them adaptations, whatever you wanna call them. That kind of dissociation if you will is a natural part of development for many people who experienced really challenging childhoods. So this thing we're talking about, about love gets imprisoned they're locked into the certainty of either having to fight against the feeling of shame - 

00:49:10
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:49:10
DAN SIEGEL - or against the memory of being abused, or against the feeling of incredible isolation cuz you are neglected. And in those various ways, you're constricting your capacity to drop into uncertainty because you just wanna fix yourself and say, "I'm not gonna feel that. I'm not gonna feel that. I'm gonna feel that." All right, like that. So this discussion we're having, to me, is very illuminating about the whole process of psychotherapy. Because in many ways those locked situations, the energy curve has developed the pattern. It's for semantic shadows, if you will, in the brain of having the, the, uhm, brain manifest in degrees of, of certainty that lock a person, that kind of psychic prison. Does that make sense? 

00:50:00
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes, it makes very good sense. Ah, and I was just thinking too as you're saying that that, ah, it is possible, uhm, when you have a very traumatic childhood and you really, uhm, don't feel that you receive the kind of love that you needed from your parents to fall in love with the universe instead. And the kind of, ah, adapt nature, adapt universe, as a very, uhm, sustaining sort of maternal figure. Uhm, and then you feel very connected also to everything that is going on outside of you to the rest of the world as well. 

00:50:40
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. You know, speaking of connections, I think we have 10 minutes left. 

00:50:45
DIANE ACKERMAN Oh. 

00:50:45
DAN SIEGEL And I think from my watch is right, I think we should connect with any questions, yeah. 

00:50:50
DIANE ACKERMAN Oh, I, I think so. Yeah. 

00:50:55
DAN SIEGEL So if anyone has, ah, questions that can spark more discussion, please, there are microphones here and here. Thank you.

 When you're talking about the trauma that, that affects us and imprisons us, what's going on neurobiologically and what are ways to break that cycle? Because I'll have these moments of this connection my clients would do and immediately following is this sense of shame, fear, possessiveness comes in. 

00:51:25
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:51:25
 And more and more we do that, that breakdown process happens where it just-- so what's a way to practice to be in that moment to, to savor that, to stay in it without that fear? 

00:51:40
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:51:40
 Or, or can we even do that? 

00:51:40
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

00:51:45
DAN SIEGEL Well, I think a lot of what we're talking about actually is very relevant for that. So the first thing to say in terms of the brain is we know of, of, of very, very few things about the brain in general and even less about the brain and trauma even though I could recite for you, you know, two hours of things about the brain. We just don't know that much in terms of brain and trauma. But the, the issue we do know about is that trauma seems to impair the integrative functions of the brain. So the work of Martin Teicher at McLean Hospital Harvard, he shown that the integrative circuits of the hippocampus, the corpus callosum, and the prefrontal cortex or we do impaired in their growth, or, uhm, actually damaged. And the key we wanna see, and this is what we don't know is how psychotherapy might be able to grow especially those three integrative regions. We have every reason to believe it should be able to throughout the lifespan but we just don't know that yet. So one thing you can say from that view is that integration is blocked. Now what that would mean from our discussion is that your role as a therapist is to create that presence. And I, I talk about this in the book called the Mindful Therapist about presence, attunement, resonance, and trust. PART is the kind of the part you play. Your presence will actually give the client you're working with permission to become a part of a system, of energy and information flow because of your presence that's different from anything they had before in their traumatic past. That's the starting place in your relationship that allows the mind of this individual to become joined with you even with just your presence. That's the first thing. Your attunement, A, is that you're tuning in to the internal state. So you don't even have to worry about the brain. The idea is what's the subjective experience of your client in this moment. So you're tuning into that and you and your own inner work are staying present with that because it may end up being really terrifying, really painful. And you've got to be ready to just stay present no matter what comes up, shame, horror, memories of the unbelievable things you, you wouldn't wanna talk about. I mean, but you need to be present for that. So a therapeutic presence and attunement are essential. Then the resonance is R where you're actually allowing your own system to change because of what you're picking up from your client. And when they experience that resonance in you, they're gonna have this, I think, transformative emotion which is called the feeling felt. They will feel felt by you which is the healing process. We just published the book called Healing Moments in Therapy where you see a bunch of people including Francine Shapiro and others who write beautifully about what they view as the healing process. And if you read the, uhm, intro that I wrote and Marion Solomon, a co-editor, you know, you'll see, uhm, what we think is fundamentally what happens in therapy. And the T, finally of part is trust. The trust that's created allows this system of a we to be healing. And in that book you'll see all this different ways have actually carrying that out. 

00:54:50
DIANE ACKERMAN I don't know if other people are experiencing this, but I think you've just brilliantly described exactly the experience, the very, very positive experience that I've had in therapy in, ah, just precisely those ways. 

00:55:05
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. Thank you. And, ah, Diane wrote a beautiful book called Origami Bridges which is basically poetry about the therapy experience. 

00:55:15
DIANE ACKERMAN About the relationship. 

00:55:15
DAN SIEGEL Yeah, about the relationship, yeah. 

00:55:20
 Thank you. 

00:55:20
DAN SIEGEL Thank you. 

00:55:20
 Yeah, and, and... 

00:55:20
DAN SIEGEL Oh, we're told this is the last question. 

00:55:25
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

00:55:25
 Oh, sorry, folks. Ah, yeah, in my, in my, ah, pre-training for psychotherapy is a professional active in 25 years... 

00:55:30
DAN SIEGEL Can you go closer to the mic? 

00:55:30
 A little closer, sorry. Uhm, yes, ah, my pre-training for psychotherapy was, ah, in acting which, ah, I was professional for 25 years. And what was fascinating with that as I moved in the psychotherapy was we spent most of that time. Ah, everything was always itself plus something else and something else and sometimes lots of other things. I mean, just the people the worked with, with not only the people that we know and which we loved and we cared for, but there were also somebody else. Ah, you know, I did one play where I, I mooted my girlfriend, strangled her every night, eight performances a week. Ah, and she was my girlfriend in the play, but she was actually my girlfriend as well. And, ah, interestingly, it made us very sexual. But, but this is the idea of what you were saying, Diane, is this, this thing of wonder. So I actually find that, I, I find that, ah, ah, a static life, this lineal life really quite dull. Everything is always itself and something else and something more always seeking. And I, I think this leads to general thing of curiosity which generates this, uhm, integration where things pour out. Uhm, just... 

00:56:45
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

00:56:45
DIANE ACKERMAN And the more we learn about ourselves, ah, just in the last few years in terms of the bacteria that live in us and have more DNA than we do, in all of those different kinds of things, we discover that we are more than we thought we were. That we are much larger organism that is, ah, interacting with absolutely everything in the universe constantly. 

00:57:10
DAN SIEGEL You know, and Einstein talked about the delusion of thinking that we're separate. It isn't even called an illusion, but a psychotic belief. And when you think about love as breaking that delusion - 

00:57:20
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:57:20
DAN SIEGEL - you realize that part of what we do in therapy is to bring this sense of awe, this sense of wonder and this sense of connectedness in this presence that we bring. That's the gift that all of you are really devoting your lives to doing. So... 

00:57:35
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. And I applaud you for it. 

00:57:35
DAN SIEGEL Yes. Thank you very much. I'll say, I'll say this one thing. Uhm, Diane and I are part of this organization, this non-profit organization called Relationships First. We're actually gonna right now go down to the booth. So if you wanna ask us more questions, we're gonna go there and you can meet some other Relationships First people. Please join us on the mission to make relationships first and to realize that love is the healing force of the universe. 

00:58:00
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes, yes. 

00:58:05
DAN SIEGEL Thank you.
