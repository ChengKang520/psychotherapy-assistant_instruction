NARRATOR The children who have abused either physically, sexually or emotionally react in a variety of ways. Some show few signs, others feel confused helpless, angry and anxious. Some may experience traumatic responses that significantly impair their functioning. Play therapy can help children overcome the severe effects of trauma.

Play Therapy for Severe Psychological Trauma with Eliana Gil 

00:00:50
NARRATOR Play Therapy can be a very effective treatment approach for children who have been traumatized. But what do we mean by trauma? Dr. Eliana Gil is a family therapist as well as a registered play therapist. 

00:01:05
DR. ELIANA GIL Trauma is a sudden and unexpected and non-normative event that overwhelms the person’s perceived ability to cope. And at the same time causes physiological arousal, and I guess the most critical feature of it is that it produces a debilitating sense of helplessness and loss of control in the individual who experiences it. 

00:01:30
NARRATOR This videotape will examine the use of play therapy for severe psychological trauma. The first part of this videotape will examine the effects of trauma on children. Many children who are traumatized experience dissociation. The second part of this videotape will explore this phenomenon and what you can do to assist these children. Children who are traumatized are also highly susceptible to the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder. The final segment of this tape will examine the effects of PTSD on children looking especially at the unique form of play these children often exhibit, post-traumatic play.

Trauma Dissociation Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

DR. ELIANA GIL Andrew were these the pets of the… of the cowboy, the guerilla was the pet? 

00:02:15
ANDREW Uh…Huh… 

00:02:15
DR. ELIANA GIL , Ph.D. I think that when we were working with traumatized children that we have children who appear to us in a fragile state. The purpose of working with traumatized children I think is very clear cut. It’s to help them resolve the traumatic material, put it behind them so that they can get on with the very big task of growing up. You know what, this family does a lot of things together hah… The children you see me working with are not actual patients. They have volunteered to help in the production of this videotape with the permission of their parents. 

00:02:55
Trauma 

00:03:00
NARRATOR When children are traumatized they feel overwhelmed by the abuse event and lose their sense of control over their lives, leaving them feeling helpless and fearful. The effects of abuse on children are severe, however not every child who is abused is also traumatized. 

00:03:20
DR. ELIANA GIL All children who are abused are victimized and they are exploited and they are in some way harmed. However, the children who are traumatized by that experience are really a subset of abused children. And if the child continues to have all of those negative experiences and that level of difficulty which is extreme after an abuse experience then I think we have to think of the child as a child who has been traumatized by the event. 

00:03:50
DR. ELIANA GIL When children are traumatized they may exhibit several responses including: 

00:03:50
RESPONSES TO TRAUMA Persistent startle response Irritability Outbursts of anger Fixation on the trauma Decrease in functioning 

00:03:55
DR. ELIANA GIL a persistent startle response, irritability, explosive outburst of anger, a fixation on the trauma and overall decrease in functioning. 

00:04:05
RESPONSES TO TRAUMA Nightmares and flashbacks Disturbances of cognition Dissociation 

00:04:05
DR. ELIANA GIL Dreams punctuated by nightmares and flashbacks, disturbances of cognition and dissociation. Children are at greater risk than adults for traumatic effects, because they don’t yet have an established identity and their coping behaviors are still limited. Play Therapy offers them a methodology through which the therapist can help them process the event and move on with their lives. 

00:04:30
DR. ELIANA GIL I think that the best way to be helpful to kids is to facilitate a process by which they deal with traumatic material, because that seems to be the most helpful thing we can do for them. Ah… And at… at the same time I don’t think forcing and coursing and focusing only on traumatic material is necessary. You have to let kids pace a little bit as well. So I make invitations to children. Let's say a child has had some negative event occur in a bathroom. Well eventually I may bring a doll house that has a bathroom in it. But you wanna stimulate the child’s ability to look at this material and begin to deal with it. And at the same time you wanna respect the defenses the child has built up because it is a painful material. So you don’t wanna blow the defenses away. You wanna do it carefully, purposefully and taking into account what the child’s need are at every junction of the therapy. 

00:05:35
DR. ELIANA GIL The goal of play therapy is to help traumatized children recapture the sense of mastery over their lives that was lost. This can be accomplished by allowing children to begin to process the traumatic events symbolically through play therapy. For example, the sand tray provides a window into the world of a child’s thoughts, emotions and feelings without relying on talk. When using the sand tray, keep in mind that the greater the variety of objects available for children to work with, the richer the verbal or non-verbal narrative they may provide. 

00:06:10
DR. ELIANA GIL You make a lot of materials available to kids that represent all aspects of life, because in fact you are asking for the creation of the world, so there should be minerals and plants and symbols of death, of birth, of caretaking, animal life, all kinds of different forms of life. And it's interesting to watch children pick and choose and also you know there’s two separate things happening here. There is the process the child has absorbed with of creating this environment and the various feeling that he has as he touches things and looks at things and starts creating images that come to life. And then there is content, different things you might wanna know a little bit more about or ask about. 

00:07:05
DR. ELIANA GIL So now tell me a little bit about your world? What’s going on in here in this world you made? 

00:07:10
JONATHAN Some animals are running around. The bees on a big… on this bear. 

00:07:15
DR. ELIANA GIL Uh…Huh… 

00:07:20
JONATHAN Because the bee… Because the bear stole the bees' honey. 

00:07:20
DR. ELIANA GIL Ah… 

00:07:25
JONATHAN I put here in because it's like among those peoples in the circle training the tiger. 

00:07:30
DR. ELIANA GIL Aah…Aah… So he is the… the lion tamer or the tiger tamer? 

00:07:35
JONATHAN I put the coffin, I put in these to show everywhere people die. I put him and shows his ghost. 

00:07:45
DR. ELIANA GIL Uh…Huh… 

00:07:45
JONATHAN The same one with that. 

00:07:50
DR. ELIANA GIL The sand tray that Jonathan created is rich in variety and detail. This is not usually the kind of world a traumatized child would create. 

00:08:00
DR. ELIANA GIL I worked with a child who is eight years old, who had been sodomized and he came into treatment a very anxious child, very guarded. He had become very isolated from his peers. He was spending a lot of time in his room alone. Ah… This issue was very-very difficult for him to negotiate. Ah… He had been sodomized by someone who he didn’t know very well. He had met on the couple of occasions and someone who hung around the school. Ah… So he didn’t have a relationship with this person and also his parents had been very-very appropriately responsive to him when this event occurred. So there were certain elements that… that were there that might mitigate the negative impact of this event, that is that his family was so responsive and really there was no part of relationship to this person who had hurt him. But this child had a lot of questions about safety now and as a result of this event he was very concerned about being snagged by someone. He was concerned that he had trusted this man and had gone with him. Umm… And… And basically developed almost like a phobic behavior, where he is afraid to leave his room, afraid to leave the house, had a great deal of difficulty after school and waited in the principal's office until someone came and picked him up, whereas prior to this event he was going outside. 

00:09:15
Re-creation 

00:09:20
DR. ELIANA GIL And it was interesting when he came into the playroom again working now in a wet sand tray. He created these very interesting cave-like structures. He brought in toilet paper roles. Those little cylinders and… and he brought 'em in and he started building these cave-like structures with these little cylinders inside. The next thing that he did was, he took these little figures and he picked only the male figures. He took the little tiny male figures and inserted them into these cylinders under these mounds, of… of wet sand. And they started building a life in there and he called this the safe underground. He then would come in and he would bring little food for them and put little food in there and ah… they basically had, he would put little pieces of cotton in there, so they would have something soft to lay down on. He did all kinds of interesting things with his safe underground. And this became symbolically a world that he created where no bad things would happen. And of course this is very nice to see a child do but at the same time, a phobia is the problem you don’t want to too much encourage this safe underground world where he never comes out again. Well, he did this for about six to seven to eight weeks. And very little else was said that he was consumed by this play and again I’m a non-directive therapist with him. From time-to-time I'd ask him questions about things and he'd just simply tell me more about his underground world. And then eventually what happened was he brought some straws in. And I didn’t know what that was about but he very carefully put the straw… Once his structure was built and his people were inside he started putting the straws coming out from the structures. And so of course I asked a little bit about the straws. Well the straws were so that the light would get in. So now we’re beginning to see a very safe underground world, but there's some contact with the outside world. And then we started talking a little bit more about the life they were having inside and how there were certain things they didn’t have available to them. Like they didn’t have TV and ah… they didn’t have good schools to go to and things like that. And so we talked about the advantages of the safe underground world. And then some of the disadvantages of the safe underground world. And then eventually he started ah… putting a little, he put little a triangle on these straws and what that was… was something whereby the kids could lookout and see and they could turn in to look around and see if everything was gonna be safe outside. Now, as this child is doing this he's also behaviorally beginning to behave… to act differently in the school setting. So he is beginning for example to come outside to recess more. He is beginning to allow himself to experiment with other children. And so you see that this work is very much in contact with what’s happening outside the therapy. Well eventually the story ah… that happens with the underground world is that the kids come out and start experimenting slowly with seeing what it's really like outside and then that we talk about the advantages of a safe over the ground world and he built this very-very nice kind of little village outside where the kids could come out but they always had their little safe underground world to go back to and eventually the kids would come out and stay longer and longer periods of time. So it's really neat to watch how kids can bring up the issues they need to work on them the way they need to, take the time they need to do it. And basically again the clinical posture is to be supportive, to be witness whatever the child does to give unconditional approval of the things that the child does in the play ah… and to ask questions or to post questions so that the child can eventually begin to think a little bit more about other possibilities.

"By their very nature and degree of personal impact, traumatic experiences can skew expectations about the world, the safety and security for interpersonal life and the childs’ sense of personal integrity.” Robert Pynoos, 1996 Dissociation 

00:13:50
NARRATOR Children who suffer trauma are unable to protect themselves physically, so they defend themselves emotionally by disengaging from reality. 

00:13:55
Dissociation A disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity and perception of the environment. 

00:13:55
NARRATOR The essential features of dissociation are disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity and perception of the environment. The more chronic and severe the trauma, the greater the likelihood of dissociation. 

00:14:15
DR. ELIANA GIL Dissociation is simply a psychological defense that kids use. Because the reality is that they can’t fight off ah… the things that happen to them physically. Ah… So this is a way emotionally that they use to protect themselves. And kids dissociate in lots of different ways. Sometimes they pretend to leave their bodies and they have these images of floating outside of themselves. And I’ve had kids who say to me, I wasn’t there or it didn’t happen to me. And I… When I say to them who did it happen to? They say the other little girl. Then I might say draw a picture of that other little girl. Well that other little girl is the part of them that was able to leave so that they didn’t feel hurt. So in a way what it does is it postpones the hurt that a child can experience if they stay intact emotionally and physically congruent at the moment that the abuse is… is occurring. 

00:15:15
DR. ELIANA GIL Art work can be a revealing medium for working with children who may be experiencing dissociation. Let's look at the work of a child who is not dissociating. 

00:15:25
DR. ELIANA GIL Obviously this is a pretty well-organized tree, very robust as supposed to some of the trees that we sometimes see which are ah… pretty depleted and disorganized and clear they don’t have a lot of stability in them. Chris is also using the paper very well. Sometimes ah… with some of the children that we work with who have had difficult experiences you find a ah… an inability to really use the space well. It's almost as if they were overwhelmed by the boundaries of the paper and so they make very-very small little figures and very small little trees and things like that. Chris is using ah… obviously a lot of space and using very bold colors and… you know obviously a young man who feels pretty confident about himself. 

00:16:25
DR. ELIANA GIL The qualities that Chris's painting reveal are in start contrast to the work created by children who are traumatized and dissociating. This is a picture that was drawn by a nine-year-old child and he had been through a variety of different types of abuse. He was neglected. He was sexually abused by his mother and he was ah… physically abused by both mother and a boyfriend at the time. Ah… So he had a lot of difficulty with his own sense of self. He was a child who dissociated quite frequently and he would do it in two primary ways. The first one was the use of seeing himself as a robot and in his back you can see little box and he said that’s a door and you open it and then you turn me… you turn on or you turn off and then he proceeded to… to say that depending on whether he was on or off he would mobilize or not mobilize. Ah… The other way that he used to dissociate however was that he would behave and see himself as if he was a small animal. And so you can see that he’s got a tail coming out of his back as well. And apparently when he was very little, he would ah… get positive feedback from his mother if he behaved as if he was a little puppy. You can also see in the drawing that this child, because of this severe and extensive sexual abuse had some gender identity problems. He has one testicle in one place and then he has a large penis that extends out to where his foot is and he has another testicle at the top of his penis. So he was very-very concerned with his own sense of integrity, physical integrity. Ah… Often talked about not wanting to have a penis altogether because he had been sexually abused so much that he thought it would be better to be a girl and ah… from his particular perspective that would keep him safer, because no one would touch his penis or force him to do anything with his penis. Many clinicians observe disassociation in children but are uncertain how to proceed. 

00:18:40
Dramatization 

00:18:40
DR. ELIANA GIL For example, this child experiences trans behaviors, that is he depersonalizes. Over the years, I’ve developed some techniques for addressing this phenomenon. 

00:18:50
Develop a language 

00:18:50
DR. ELIANA GIL First develop a language, that is find a way to talk about it by asking the child how they describe what happens and then use their terms. 

00:19:00
DR. ELIANA GIL If you are watching a TV show and you’re like in the middle of the story and suddenly you sort fade out and then you look, oh it's over and you sort of missed it. Do you ever have anything like that happen to you? 

00:19:10
Yeah. 

00:19:10
DR. ELIANA GIL It does. And, when that happens to you what do you call it? 

00:19:15
Ah… Out in the space. 

00:19:20
DR. ELIANA GIL Out in the space? 

00:19:20
Yeah. 

00:19:20
Assess the pattern of occurrence 

00:19:25
Second, assess the pattern of occurrence of the dissociative behavior. Ask the child to talk about the most recent occurrence. 

00:19:30
DR. ELIANA GIL Well, what was the last time that that happen to you? 

00:19:35
Umm… About three days ago. 

00:19:35
DR. ELIANA GIL Three days ago! And what was going on when you shut down or went into space? 

00:19:40
Ah… We were driving and it’s 45 minutes from here to Baltimore. 

00:19:45
DR. ELIANA GIL Uh…Huh… 

00:19:45
And I was kind of spaced out for about 20 minutes. And I woke up about 10 minutes from there. 

00:19:50
DR. ELIANA GIL Hmm… 

00:19:50
Determine the sequence of events 

00:19:50
DR. ELIANA GIL Third, determine the sequence of events that occur when the child dissociates by asking the child to pretend the dissociate, paying attention to the body, emotions, thoughts and feelings. 

00:20:05
DR. ELIANA GIL So I'm going to ask you like your homework assignment. You don’t have to do it right now, but when you get home this is the… the homework part. I want to pretend that you’re spacing out or shutting down. And just sit there and say okay, I'm gonna sit here and I'm gonna pretend that I’m doing it. And when you pretend, pay attention to, for example if you say something to yourself, you get words you know something to say yourself like ah… be quiet or you know I don’t know what you would say but some words that you might. The other thing I want you to pay attention to is as you say yourself I'm going to pretend to do this notice what your body does. You know like do you put you’re feet on the ground, you lie down, you shut your eyes, you open your eyes. Some people stare at one little part. 

00:20:55
Yeah. Sometimes I would go. 

00:21:00
DR. ELIANA GIL Yeah, you just start staring. Hahaha… Any and all of those and just kind to make a note of what it is you’re doing. And then if you have any feelings, while you pretend to do this that would be interesting to note. 

00:21:10
Explain that this is an adaptive behavior 

00:21:15
DR. ELIANA GIL Fourth, explain that this is an adaptive behavior that can be helpful, but also that there is some disadvantages. 

00:21:20
The principal was taking to me about something and I would space out. And she’s was like, “Right?” and I’m like, “Uh, What?” 

00:21:25
DR. ELIANA GIL What did you say? So… So in a way this… this thing that helps you out sometimes get you in trouble because you could miss what somebody said and you can miss knowing something that you're really supposed to know and something that. So it is an interesting thing because it helps you sometimes and then it doesn’t help you sometimes. Right, instead of like an advantage you would be able to that and the disadvantages sometimes. 

00:21:45
Yeah. 

00:21:45
Understand the precipitants 

00:21:50
DR. ELIANA GIL Fifth, understand the precipitants, document the issues or events that seem to elict their response such as pain, anger, longing or arousal. 

00:21:55
Address the troublesome emotion 

00:22:00
DR. ELIANA GIL Six, address the troublesome emotion and then deal with that in therapy. 

00:22:05
Explore or suggest specific alternatives to dissociation 

00:22:05
DR. ELIANA GIL And finally, explore or suggest specific alternatives to dissociation. 

00:22:10
DR. ELIANA GIL So I was wondering if you would be interested in trying to learn, how do you stop it when you don't wanna have it. And then other times it’ll be funny, like you know I’m a tripper or something like that when nobody is talking to you and you could just kind of space out. But I’m wondering if you would like to learn how to stop it when you don’t want it or when you think of my getting to come in. 

00:22:30
DR. ELIANA GIL The point is that dissociation is an adaptive response that if used exclusively may prevent the child from arriving at a healthy resolution or closure. 

00:22:45
DR. ELIANA GIL So there are definite problems in this ability to dissociate although I think again for many kids it spares a lot of pain at that moment also creates this problem with identity. And often times when kids have this ability to dissociate it also makes them feel like they’re not truly real. And so it can a create a whole other complication for them, because they may actually go through periods of time that they can’t remember because they don’t feel like they were really there. 

00:23:20
“Many children and adults, when confronted with overwhelming threat, are unable to integrate the totality of what is happening into consciousness. Sensory and emotional elements of the event may not be integrated onto personal memory and identity, and remain isolated from ordinary consciousness.” Bessel Van Der Kolk, 1996 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 

00:23:55
DR. ELIANA GIL Good night everybody. 

00:23:55
NARRATOR When the abuse event is resolved, the child disengages from the trauma, feels a renewed sense of control and can move forward towards new experiences without feeling vulnerable or in danger. When the trauma is not resolved however, the individual continues to feel threatened and vulnerable. Post-traumatic stress disorder signals that the individual is still living in the climate of the trauma, either through dreams, sensations or emotions. A child with PTSD can be helped by bringing the trauma to conscious awareness and by working through the thoughts and feelings associated with the events. 

00:24:35
DR. ELIANA GIL With children who are traumatized these symptoms persist over a very long period of time and don’t seem to decrease. Ah… As a matter of fact sometimes they seem to increase so that the overall effect is that a child who is traumatized his living in the climate of the trauma so that everything they see reminds them of the trauma, everything they hear reminds some of it. They’re constantly triggered by all the stimuli out there ah… to be directly in contact without that event again. They feel as if it's happening to them all the time. I’ve had kids who write… who…who will say to me I feel like he is touching me right now or I feel like she is doing that to me right now. That’s a traumatic response. There is usually a great deal of PTSD, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder symptoms ah… numbing, ah… volatility, intrusive flashbacks, auditory hallucinations, physical sensations reminiscent of the event. 

00:25:35
DR. ELIANA GIL This is an interesting example of a child who was suffering from PTSD symptoms. She was five years old and suddenly started wearing six and eight pairs of underwear at school and the teacher thought that was noteworthy and preferred her in for treatment. When I asked her to draw picture of herself, she draws not only herself but the… what appears to be the face of another person. When I asked her to tell me about that piece of the drawing, she said that was the bad man. When I asked her what the man did or said that made him bad. She started talking about him whispering in her ear. And really what she started describing was in PTSD terms, auditory hallucinations. And the fact was that ever since she had been hurt by this person she heard his voice was constantly reminded of him through smells in the house ah… whenever she was in bed she couldn’t tolerate being there because that was where she had been abused so she would get out of bed. And probably the most telling sign was that she felt in her body that she had to cover up and cover up more and more all the time because she felt so exposed and vulnerable. And those were all signs of PTSD. These symptoms seemed to be related to the level of the child’s feelings of helplessness and loss of control as a result of the abuse. 

00:27:00
DR. ELIANA GIL I’ve worked with some kids for example who are clearly able to say to me, well this happened to me but I fought back and that level of control at least gives them a feeling that there were something sort of invincible about them or something that they figured out, some sense of mastery as opposed kids who are traumatized and feel flat helpless that there’s nothing they can do, nothing they can negotiate for themselves and therefore it's that debilitating sense of helplessness that often contributes to this feeling of being traumatized. 

00:27:35
Clinical Video 

00:27:40
DR. ELIANA GIL There are also times when the child’s seems compelled to reenact the traumatic event in an effort to master it. This form repetitive reenactment is called post-traumatic play. 

00:27:50
DR. ELIANA GIL It’s very unique, it’s very different than generic play in children. And in that play they recreate the trauma over and over and over again in a very literal, very repetitive way. 

00:28:00
NARRATOR This girl was alone at home when she had an acute appendicitis attack. Her parents could not be found. She made her way to a neighbor's house and the neighbor called an ambulance. Frightened and in pain she was taken to the hospital where emergency surgery was performed. These events overwhelmed her leaving her traumatized. Referred for treatment, she exhibited post-traumatic play reenacting the episode over and over. 

00:28:30
DR. ELIANA GIL As soon as she saw the hospital equipment, she was compelled to take these little figures out, put them into a very specific order. And she was very adamant about where these little tiny pieces were placed on the table and they had to look the same way each and every time, that in her itself was unusual because it was so rigid. The next thing that was interesting was that the play was so repetitive that it had no deviations from one session to another. There was also a lack of spontaneity, a lack of interaction with the therapist. Most children tend to enjoy play. She never appeared to be experiencing any pleasure whatsoever. She seemed self-absorbed in the play. And it looked like she was in a kind of a trans when she was doing the play. 

00:29:25
POST-TRAUMATIC PLAY Compulsive repetition Unconscious link between the play and the real event Literalness of play Failure to relieve anxiety Depiction of danger Lack of spontaneity and enjoyment 

00:29:25
DR. ELIANA GIL Post-traumatic play has several features including compulsive repetition, an unconscious link between the play and the real event, the literalness of the play, the failure to relieve anxiety, a depiction of danger and the lack of spontaneity and enjoyment. Post-traumatic play has the potential to be beneficial. For example, the child moves from a passive to an active state. Here she also controls the reenactment and revisits the event in a safe environment, allowing the child to regain some sense of mastery. But letting a child continue to do post-traumatic play long-term can be dangerous if the child does not experience a release from the anxiety and if it reinforces his/her feelings of terror, helplessness and vulnerability. 

00:30:25
DR. ELIANA GIL I think one of the clinical questions that is posed to me with a greatest frequency is, ah… when you see post-traumatic play do you always just let it go on uninterrupted? And I think that it's very valuable to watch it uninterrupted for a period of time. But then if it seems to be debilitating to the child, if it seems to actually be making the child worse, or if the child appears to be re-traumatized because of the play, an exposure to the play then obviously, we’ve got to intervene and make sure that we do something that causes positive change. 

00:31:00
DR. ELIANA GIL When I observed that a child seems stuck in the same ritualistic play of over a period of time, I’ll intervene in one or more of the following ways. 

00:31:10
ASKING THE CHILD TO MAKE PHYSICAL MOVEMENT such as standing up, moving arms, or taking deep breaths. 

00:31:10
DR. ELIANA GIL By asking the child to make some physical movement such as standing up, moving arms or taking deep breaths. Physical movement may free up emotional constriction. 

00:31:20
MAKING VERBAL STATEMENTS ABOUT THE PLAY suspending the self-absorption and rigidity of the play. 

00:31:20
DR. ELIANA GIL By making verbal statements about the child's post-traumatic play hopefully suspending the self-absorption and rigidity of the play. 

00:31:30
INTERRUPTING THE SEQUENCE OF PLAY and asking the child to take a specific role, describing perceptions and feeling. 

00:31:30
DR. ELIANA GIL By interrupting the sequence of play and asking the child to take a specific role describing their perceptions and feelings. 

00:31:35
MANIPULATING THE TOYS moving them around, and asking the child to respond to “What would happen if…”questions. 

00:31:40
DR. ELIANA GIL By manipulating the toys, moving them around and asking the child to respond to questions such as, what would happen if? 

00:31:45
ENCOURAGING THE CHILD TO DIFFERENTIATE between the traumatic event in the past and current reality in terms of safety and what has been learned. 

00:31:45
DR. ELIANA GIL By encouraging the child to differentiate between the traumatic event in the past and current reality in terms of safety and what has been learned. 

00:31:55
VIDEOTAPING THE PLAY and watching the tape with the child, stopping it for discussion of what is observed.

DR. ELIANA GIL And finally, by videotaping the post-traumatic play and watching the tape with the child, allowing him/her to stop it and discuss what is being observed. Simply reenacting the trauma over and over again without any resolution may reinforce the child’s sense of helplessness and lack of control. It is useful is these situations to take an active role in helping the child enter and maneuver the play, actively commenting or interrupting the sequence of events.

"Traumatized children repeat in actions. Whereas adults who are shocked or severely stressed tend to talk about it, dream or visualize, children take far more action. Even though traumatic events are external, they quickly become incorporated into the mind, particularly when the individual feels utter helplessness.” Lenore Terr, 1990

NARRATOR The goal of treating children who have been traumatized is to help them resolve the troubling thoughts, emotions and behaviors the traumatic event has created. If the event cannot be brought into awareness and put into perspective, these intrusions will persist making it all the more important to confront the trauma, and gently overtime helping the child to process it in a positive way.

DR. ELIANA GIL When we’re working with kids who’ve been traumatized, I think that the goal is that the traumatic event be resolved, which means that there will be some closure around it. That doesn’t mean that it’s not going to in five years come back to them because of whatever reason or that, they’re going to have hurtfull feelings associated with it somewhere down the line. But it does mean that at… on some level this event is manageable to them. It no longer overwhelms them. They've disengaged from it enough, so that it’s not something it's on their mind all the time. It doesn’t define who they are. One of the most important things, I think for people who have been hurt in childhood, is not to walk away and say that’s who I am. I am a victim. I am a survivor. I think it's important to say these are events that happened to me and they are part of my life, experience and they shape impart, who I am and what kind of resiliency I have or how I view the world, but they aren’t who you are. So that type of closure with this event no longer is foreboden, something they can never speak about, something that if they start to think about, they have very uncomfortable feelings about, something they feel they’ve relive all the time, that's the resolution of the trauma, that’s called closure of the trauma. And I think that that’s very necessary in order to again move on and have functioning be restored.
