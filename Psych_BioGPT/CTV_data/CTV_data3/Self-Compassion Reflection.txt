DAY 31 

00:00:35
Self-Compassion Reflection 

00:00:35
DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Current research on compassion informs us that people who have a higher degree of compassion whether for a known loved one, a stranger or someone who can be described as a difficult person or even someone you had a conflict with, have fewer and less intense symptoms of depression and anxiety or stress than those people who have less compassion. I think one of the most important things that we can learn to do is to build this internal recourse for feeling a greater sense of peace, acceptance and relaxation using self-compassion, reflection exercise. In this exercise, the individual is asked to identify a person who make him easily feel a positive sense of compassion toward. They then use this as the basis of understanding compassion which they eventually direct toward themselves, building a resource of self-compassion and this increased feelings of self-compassion of course are known to be related to lessen feelings of stress, depression and anxiety. Let's practice together. Start by reflecting on someone, you know, someone who might be alive or no longer present, somebody who you know from a distance or you understand on a certain level, but might not know personally. Maybe this is an animal from whom you can easily feel a sense of appreciation and openhearted warmth and acceptance. Write down the names of those whom this sensation applies to. Next, reflect on the center of your heart allowing for the beginning of a full body warm positive emotion to be present while you recall the person or animal. Close your eyes and hold this feeling for a few minutes as best as you can. This begins to practice of learning about compassion and as a result increasing your ability to understand the way in which it expresses itself through your body, mind and spirit. Now, the following three phrases, repeat silently in your mind three times. Let's practice together. May you have kindness in your life.

DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY May you have peace in your life. May you have health in your life. And again, focusing on this person or animal, may you have kindness in your life. May you have peace in your life. May you have health in your life. And finally, may you have kindness in your life. May you have peace in your life. May you have health in your life. Now take a moment in like outer reflections on what it feels like to hold this feeling of compassion toward another in your own heart. Now close your eyes again and return to the heartfelt open and warm sensation and this time allow yourself to shine this full feeling on yourself. Hold it as well as you can, allowing yourself to release any negative thoughts that might surface. Again place yourself fully within the heartfelt open and warm self-regard from what you're learning. Simply notice any feelings of resistance and release as well as you can, so that it's replaced by new sensations of self-compassion that you're learning about now. And then repeat the three phrases this time silently to yourself. I embrace kindness in my life. I embrace peace in my life. I embrace health in my life. And again, I embrace kindness in my life. I embrace peace in my life. I embrace health in my life. I embrace kindness in my life. I embrace peace in my life. I embrace health in my life. Just let all of that wash over you. And reflect and enlight about the feelings you experience when you allow yourself to embrace the sense of self-compassion. If you notice that this ignite a strong negative feelings at first, rest assure that this is not unusual to initially resist self-compassion and it gets easier with practice. Write about these feelings and then practice the ideas of self-compassion for others and towards yourself again until you're better able to sit comfortably with the feelings that go always to eventually work through any negative feelings, allowing them to be gradually replaced with the warm feelings of self-compassion, acknowledgement and acceptance. This is certainly one of my favorite exercises and I hope that you'll find it useful as well.
