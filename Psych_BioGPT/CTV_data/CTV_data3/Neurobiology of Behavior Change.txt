Neurobiology of Behavior Change By Dr Matthew Bambling UQ 

00:00:00
AIMS • To demonstrate the brain is a dynamic organ that rapidly responds to environment • Examine pathways by which psychological therapy might influence brain structure leading to behavior change • Examine implications for psychological therapy 

00:00:00
Introduction • The area of science we are about to look at is in its infancy so exact mechanisms are not fully understood • Some of what we will look at is based on animal models • There is a good deal of theory in this presentation and some of it my theory • The presentation is aimed at a general audience 

00:00:00
Our dynamic brains: neuroplasticity (NP) • When we think, action potentials (AP) fire across neurons that stimulate APs in other neurons. When we are learning or practice something, the repeated firing (use of the network) of neurons begins to strengthen dendrite connections and may up regulate various neurotransmitter receptors and neural growth factors. • Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) then stimulates dendrites to grow and wire up to respond to learning demands and code information for the development of new behaviors. • A bit like adding more memory to a computer as the program software requirements increase. 

00:00:00
Our dynamic brains: neuroplasticity • Likewise under use can reduce dendrite density and number and down regulate receptors. • NP can also work against us: brain areas involved with anxiety and threat perception can strengthen whereas areas involved in thinking and memory get weaker in mental health problems. • Often marked by a down regulation of NP via neurotrophin pathway as opposed to simple under or over use of specific parts of the brain 

00:00:00
So what modulates these changes in the brain? • Simply thinking creates action potentials and activates a class of genes that we will call immediate response genes (IRG) • IRGs influence neurotrophins release and synthesis 

00:00:00
Neurotrophins • Neurotrophins are growth factors, secreted proteins that literally signal neurons to stay alive, differentiate, or grow. • BDNF is a neurotrophic factor involved with dendrite and receptor growth important for NP • Neurotrophins also induce differentiation of progenitor cells, to form neurons and are important for Neurogenisis • New fact: we need IRG and growth factor activity to keep neurons alive. If we don't use our neurons they may not hang around, the principle of conservation is true for the brain 

00:00:00
Neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and of many other neuronal genes 

00:00:00
Pathways • Probably the degree of simulation or mental activation via action potentials is read by IRGs that then decide what neurochemicals or other genes involved in brain growth and memory coding are activated • So IRGs operate as a class of signals or keys to activate a variety of processes in the brain. • This is the basis of NP, our brains change in response to our positive or negative thoughts, learning or social or physical environment. 

00:00:00
Neuron - action potential Gene expression 

00:00:00
Evidence: How do we know these classes of genes exist? • Have been found to activate in waking intentional states as well as REM sleep in humans and animals. • Are closely involved with learning and memory. • They are activated quickly, induced in seconds and activate neural networks in different behavioral states. • Some suggest this helps explain the molecular and cellular correlates of arousal, alertness and even consciousness. • Are IRGs the bridge between our minds and our physical biology? 

00:00:00
To Summarize this section • When we think we activate IRGs which then activate or do not activate proteins or other genes to engage neural networks involved with memory and behavior • IRGs turn on 2; target gene transcription for 3; new protein synthesis of growth factors, hormones, neurotransmitters that generate 4; brain plasticity • Results: mind-body alterations and changes in our conscious awareness of self, others and our perception of issues.

00:00:00
Paradigm shift • This is a fundamental shift to a top down approach, from the traditional bottom up paradigm that genetics are stable and shape behavior • This raises an interesting possibility that we might also modify gene expression in disease states though psychotherapy • May explain the effectiveness of behavioral medicine and the sometimes unexpected benefits of psychotherapy on physical health problems 

00:00:00
Switching on IRGs • What type of mental states cause IRGs to activate and stimulate neural networks involved with behavior? • It seems to be linked to attentional activation and/or arousal, such as intentional focused cognition, meditation, creativity, REM sleep, physical arousal and exercise, psychological and physical distress, pain, worry, trauma and so on • Can equal positive or negative mental health changes, the process remains the same

00:00:00
Is this an explanation for consciousness? What animal models tell us • When we consider that we share up to 99% of our genes with primates and mice for that matter should they have similar conscious experience to us? • The evidence suggests they don't! Our consciousness is human specific • Studies show that gene expression in organs such as heart and liver are very similar between humans and for example Chimpanzees • However, the brain is a different story, there are to date about 169 genes found to exhibit expression differences between human and Chimp cortexes. • 91 of these genes are human specific. 

00:00:00
Is this a biological explanation for consciousness? • However where genes are shared, the differences relate to higher levels of expression in humans than in Chimps • Is the higher activation of consciousness a result of elevated gene expression? • The higher expressed shared genes examined to date influence hormones, neural growth factors, neurotransmitters, cytokines, interleukins and the neuroimmune system • The up regulation of so many genes indicates that we have a higher level of neuronal activity and metabolic process compared to primates • This in part helps explain the differences between performance of human and primate brains . At best, this is only a part explanation of the biology of consciousness

00:00:00
Turning on our genes for change • In relation to psychotherapy, learning is the main mechanism. Changes in gene expression alter the strength of dendritic/synaptic connections. • These structural changes then alter anatomical patterns of connections between nerve cells and the brain • In animal models, when exposed to novelty, environmental enrichment and exercise the zif- 268 gene is expressing during REM sleep. Zif-268 is an IRG and a behavioral state gene that is associated with the generation of proteins and growth factors involved with plasticity • Is this the trigger gene for NP? • Answer: we don't know for sure 

00:00:00
Chronic stress states: alternate gene pathways and structural changes • Acetylcholine is an important memory neurotransmitter and can take different synthesis pathways in stress and trauma states. • Chronic stress or trauma is associated with disturbed circadian rhythms, changed cholinergic gene expression, and changes in acetylcholine and acetylcholinestrerase metabolism (e.g. Found in PTSD) • May create a unique form of mRNA and AChE-R as a stress modulator for the hippocampus (important memory structure). However, over expression can damage the hippocampus and may be a risk for glial cancer (aggressive brain tumor) 

00:00:00
Chronic stress states: alternate gene pathways and structural changes • Affects CREB, transcription factor that activates genes related to plasticity, memory and learning affecting brain function • Interferes with the 90-120 minute rhythms of sleep • Over expression of cortisol • Results: Hippocampal shrinkage, atrophy, impaired learning and memory 

00:00:00
Evidence for structure changes in the brain in animals and humans • Animals: Rats exposed to complex social environments created more synapses per neuron that remained for at least 30 days after the experiment than rats in paired or individual housing • Humans: Higher number of social contacts and richness in social environment lessens risk of dementia in elderly people • Listening to music helps create and strengthen more dendritic connections in the auditory, processing and motor areas of the brain. For example, the Mozart effect; where exposure increases cognitive and motor abilities. • Effect strongest in children. The 60 beat per minute of Mozart activates brain hemispheres and strengthens the corpus collousum 

00:00:00
What areas of the brain does psychotherapy genetically influence. Does medication help provide an answer? • Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to alter some of the same biological mechanisms typically affected by medications. • An antidepressant medication response is associated with a 5 percent to 20 percent reduction in thyroid hormone levels • A similar reduction in thyroid hormone levels has been found in treatment responders to 20 weekly sessions of CBT with symptom remission. Increased thyroid levels have been found in patients who did not respond to CBT. • While any role for thyroid hormone in depression remains unknown, it does appear to be a marker for depression improvement 

00:00:00
Changes in gene expression and brain metabolism in psychological treatment • The effects of psychotherapy can also be examined through scans. • Studies have used positron emission tomography (PET) scans of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) before and after they received two months of behavioral therapy and compared with patients before and after treatment with fluoxetine. 

00:00:00
Scans at the right taken 2 months after therapy, demonstrating reduced glucose metabolism 

00:00:00
Explanation • This scan shows decreased glucose metabolic activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and right caudate after the therapy. Medication worked about the same. • The orbitofrontal cortex is part of the brain system that signals to us that something is wrong in the environment or is a threat. • It may be the case that in OCD the excessive metabolic activity in this part of the brain represents faulty error signals that distort the perception and interpretation of threat factors in their environment. • A theme of CBT is to reduce distorted thinking around environmental cues in OCD. 

00:00:00
Depression • 15-20 sessions of CBT has been shown to increase metabolic activity in the hippocampus and anterior cingulate and decrease metabolic activity in the dorsal, ventral, and medial frontal cortices in treatment responders. • When compared to medication, antidepressant users experienced metabolic activity increase in the prefrontal cortex and decrease in the brainstem and subgenual cingulated. • Although CBT and antidepressants where found to improve depression to the same extent, they appear to activate different brain circuits. 

00:00:00
Which treatment is best? • Does this mean that CBT is the best psychoneuro approach to therapy, not at all? • Many meta analyses have concluded that all relatively short term therapy approaches have similar effect sizes. • There is intriguing evidence that for more serious psychiatric and chronic mental heath disorders that psychodynamic and psychoanalytic therapy may have special efficacy. • For example with serious mental health problems it appears that psychoanalytically orientated treatment may be better, e.g. once a week verses 3 times a week for 2.5 years was found to create a %50 and %72 significant improvement of symptoms respectively. 

00:00:00
• Psychodynamic therapy may have a special affinity for serotonin metabolism. • The studies examining long term PD therapy have been criticized for methodological reasons and more research is needed. • However, it can be concluded that length and intensity of therapy is important for treating more serious mental health problems. • From a NP point of view this makes a lot of sense if we want to change strong preexisting neural networks. 

00:00:00
CBT and early schizophrenia • Schizophrenia is marked by impairment to cognition that limit the effect of current treatments and recovery • The evidence to date suggests a variety of neurobiological pathologies and that contribute to cognitive impairment such as progressive loss of gray matter, frontal hypofucntion, decreased white matter integrity in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus which have been linked to neurocogntive impairment in memory and executive function. 

00:00:00
• Likewise, abnormalities in the medial temporal and medial frontal brain networks including the amygdala fusiform gyru and orbitofrontal cortex have been implicated in social cognitive impairment and perspective taking. • These impairments do not typically respond well to pharmacotherapy • Psychosocial - cognitive rehabilitation programs have demonstrated efficacy in addressing some of these cognitive impairments 

00:00:00
• In an important study (Eack et al, 2010) intensive cognitive enhancement therapy (attention, memory and problem solving and social training) was provided to people early in the course of Schizophrenic illness. • Significantly greater gray matter was preserved over the 2 year study period in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform gyrus and gray matter increased in the left amygdala compared to the control group who received supportive therapy in addition to standard medication treatment, and experienced gray matter loss. • The cognitive enhancement therapy was not only neuroprotective and preserved brain tissue, but was associated with long term positive cognitive outcomes 

00:00:00
A neurobioloigical explanation for the relationship between patient and therapist • A five-year study monitoring brain activity during therapy sessions has shown that two people can become physiologically aligned with parts of their nervous systems synchronizing, despite having no physical contact with each another • Electrodes were placed around the head to monitor brain waves in four different areas. The heart was monitored by ECG and the body through skin conductance resonance monitors to identify the moment of alignment or ''oneness'' during individual therapy sessions. 

00:00:00
More than autonomic alignment • The monitoring showed heightened activity in the parietal part of the brain, which is considered to be the seat of the imagination. It is the "alignment" between two people that is proposed as the mechanism that allows a deep feeling of connection. • The researcher (Stratford) said that this not simply being a reaction between equivalent neurons (i.e. mirror neurons) regarding what is being discussed as found in empathic states. • Participants would tune into alignment with each other regardless of discussion, as an example "My energy impacts with you just standing there," she said. "I am impacting your brain and body just by being here." 

00:00:00
• It appears that the parietal lobe is activated. Parietal lobe activation has been studied in consciousness research as a candidate for sixth sense like abilities. • When activated in relationship with others it allows us to read each other's brains and bodies at a deeper level. • This process may not be devoid of micro communication factors as it has been known for some time that visual and language cues in therapy may result in the alignment of some autonomic nervous systems processes. • Some scientist believe that this physiological alignment is required for successful therapy and might be a part of what we understand as a relational construct, the working alliance 

00:00:00
Implications for psychological treatment • Therapy begins as soon as intentional focus is created and aided through an alignment (alliance) with the therapist • This means that data gathering, exploration of issues and assessment is not independent of treatment • IRGs are activated simply by being in the presence of the therapist, beginning the discussion, discussing painful feelings and issues, experiences of relief or distress etc • The extent to which neuroactivation is achieved depends on the quality and quantity of the therapy 

00:00:00
Quality of therapy: some things to consider • Reconstruction of memory and learning in therapy deactivates stress induced pathways and stimulates growth factors to use higher learning and memory functions to dealing with issues, thereby enhancing or rehabilitating hippocampal function and higher cognitive function (NP). • Understanding and resolving conflicts or negative core beliefs maybe particularly important in this model. • It is reasonable to hypotheses that we may be influencing gene expression not just involved with mental health, but also sickness and disease. 

00:00:00
Practical tips for psychological treatment • Must have sufficient psychological arousal in session to facilitate IRG activation. Patients must engage. • 90 minutes may be the minimal optimal session length from a NP point of view. The brain has a basic rest activity cycle of 90-120 minutes, like in sleep. • Information between the mind and genes that involve hormones, messenger molecules triggering other gene expression via the blood stream takes place every 90- 120 minutes • Reality: seems to be too intense for therapists to manage, probably over activating their owns systems • However, some patients may benefit from somewhat longer sessions 

00:00:00
Practical tips for psychological treatment • Sleep is very important in this model for behavior change. Ensure quality sleep to facilitate maximum NP from therapy sessions • Repetition and practice are good, as the more one does it, the more it generates BDNF and activates NP • Exercise as an adjunct, powerful stimulator of neurotrophins and NP 

00:00:00
Effects of exercise on hippocampal BDNF 

00:00:00
Conclusion • At this stage the neurobiology of behavior change has not provided major discoveries to revolutionize psychotherapy • However, it has provided considerable reassurance that psychotherapy is a powerful intervention that influences our very genetic code • Assists in understanding how therapy may work • Encourages practitioners to think more broadly about treatment as a mind body intervention

DR. MATTHEW BAMBLING Hello. I'm Dr. Matthew Bambling, and um, I'm here today to talk to you about the neurology of behavior change, so I'd like to extend a welcome to everybody watching today and I hope you enjoy this presentation. The aims of this presentation today is to demonstrate the brain is a dynamic organ that rapidly responds to environment, and we're going to examine the pathways by which psychological therapy might influence brain structure, leading to behavior change and examine implications for pyschological therapy. So the area of science we're going to look at today, uh, is in its infancy, so the exact mechanisms are not fully understood. Some of what w'ere going to look at is based on animal theories, and there's a good deal of theory extrapolated from the science, and some of its mine, so I wanted to clear that up now, and the presentation itself is aimed at a general audience. So I'm gonna start off with the idea of our dynamic brains and neuroplasticity, um, and there's been a lot of attention given to neuroplasticity as a fundamental shaping force in neurology, so the ideas in our brain is just as responsive to environment physiologically as it is to uh, our inheritance, biologically, so when we think, we have a thought, action potentials are fired across neurons to stimulate other action potentials in other neurons. When we re learning or practicing something, the repeated firing - if you like, the use of the neural network - uh, begins to strengthen the dendritic connections and may upregulate various neurotransmitter receptors and neural growth factors, so in the, even at the cell surface of neurotransmitter receptors and neurotransmitter expression, things begin to change. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is secreted and then stimulates dendrites to grow and wire up to respond to learning demands, encode information for developing new behaviors, a bit like adding more memory to a computer as the program's software requirements increase. Likewise, underuse of our brains and not thinking enough can reduce dendrite density and reduce the number in downregulate receptors on the uh, cell surface. Neuroplasticity, therefore, can work against us. Brain area involved with anxiety and threat perception can strengthen where areas involved in thinking and memory get weaker and mental health problems. This idea of repeated uh, experience and practice can strengthen our pathways which aren't always desirable. Additionally to that, when these sorts of things happen, we often have a downregulation of uh, neuroplasticity via the neurotrophin pathway as opposed to under or overuse of specific parts, so the repeated experience or thinking begins to affect physiological expression of some of these things, which creates a second problem. So then what modulates these changes in the brain? So simply thinking creates action potentials, activates a class of genes, for our purposes today, we're gonna call immediate response genes - there's lots of them - and the immediate response genes influence neuroplasticity release and synthesis. That's one of the primary tasks. It's telling the brain it's gotta do something in relation to experience stimulus or learning. So neurotrophins are growth factors, secreted proteins that literally signal neurons to stay alive, alter or grow. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is involved with dendrite and receptor growth and it's really important for neuroplasticity, and it's one of the main drivers of it. Neurotrophins also induce differentiation of progenitor cells to form neurons and are important for neurogenesis, and this idea of the birth of new neural uh, neurons through neural stem cells uh, is thought to be driven by this process as well and it's very important for brain health. So a new fact: we need immediate response genes and growth factor activity to keep neurons alive. If we don't use our neurons, they may not hang around. The principle of conversation is true for the brain. It's an interesting idea that neurons can actually die from underuse. This is a little graphic at the moment which is uh, demonstrating how a neurotraphic factor's actually made. You can see protein being released and processed in the uh, (ph)goji, and then shunted off down uh, various regular, regulatory pathways to be sent off for use in stimulating neuron growth or dendritic growth. So these pathways . . . How are they activated? It's probably the degree of stimulation or mental health, mental activation via action potentials as is read by the immediate response genes that literally switch on or switch off these class of genes in response to signaling neurochemicals (ph)and other genes involved in brain growth and memory coding, so immediate response genes operate as a class of signals or keys to activate a variety of processes in the brain, and this probably the basis of neuroplasticity: our brains change in response to positive or negative thoughts, learning or social environment. So how does this work? Well, genes must express or not express to bring around about the biological changes. The methylation pathway is involved with expression and gene expression, and the phosphorylation pathway uh, through a second mechanism is involved with uh, genes not expressing, or inhibition, so you can see this idea of uh, processes that encourage expression or inhibition of genes are really important. The brain must be healthy to do this, uh, in diet, nutrition, hormones and sleep, and all these things are fundamental to a brain that's able to do these things. Of course, sophisticated neurochemical processes need to occur for these things to happen, so these things have to be in balance. You see a little graphic of a neuron and the idea of the action potential, and you can see at the end of a dendrite the synaptic cleft, with some receptors um, on the cell surface, and there's the um, neurotransmitter being secreted across, just to give you an idea of what that might look like, and uh, you can see the uh, the other side is uh, a um, kind of a, an impression of DNA, and you can see one of the genes is expressing cuz it's given a different color, just to give you an idea of how different genes express and how different things happen in neurons. So how do we know these classes of genes exist? Gene chip studies demonstrated activation in waking intentional states as well as REM sleep in humans and animals, and we'll talk about some of those genes in more detail as we move on. This class of genes are closely involved with learning and memory, ad they're activated quickly. In fact, they're induced in seconds and activate neural networks and different behavioral sites very, very quickly. This may help us to understand the molecular and cellular correlates of arousal, alertness or even consciousness, so are immediate response genes the bridge between our minds and our physical biology? So to summarize this part of the presentation: when we think, we activate fast-responding classes of genes which are then activated or do not activate proteins or other genes to engage neural networks involved with memory and behavior. Immediate response genes turn on, target gene transcription for new protein synthesis of growth factors, hormones, neurotransmitters that, in turn, generate brain plasticity. It results in mind-body alterations and changes in our consciousness awareness of self, others and our perception of issues. I have a graphic of Rossi's bioinformatic cycle, uh, which expresses this nicely. You can see the experience, cognition, the activation of genes, uh, new proteins, um, structure and then functional changes, which is physiology. This represents a bit of a paradigm shift, and it's a fundamental shift from a, from a bottom-up approach to a top-down approach, uh, in genetics. Uh, the bottom-up approach assumed that genes were stable and shaped behavior; this approach suggests not, that genes and behavior are highly influenced by uh, social environment. It raises some interesting possibilities that we might also modify gene expression and disease states through psychotherapy. It may even explain the effectiveness of behavioral medicine, and the sometimes unexpected benefits of psychotherapy or physical health problems. So switching on our immediate response genes . . . What type of mental states cause immediate response genes to activate and stimulate neural networks involved with behavior? It seems to be linked to intentional activation or arousal, such as intentional focus cognition - for example, that may occur in counseling, meditation, creativity, REM sleep, physical arousal, such as exercise uh, psychological and physical distress can turn them on as well. Other distressors such as pain, worry, trauma and so on can also switch these on, so it can equal positive or negative mental health changes. Regardless of that, the process is very, very similar. I have another graphic explaining that idea, and uh, you can see that mental stimulation such as creativity, distress, uh, targets gene transcription, and once again, the protein synthesis, and we see the plastistic changes occur and the associated learning and behavior that's expressed with that. So is this an explanation of consciousness? What do animal models tell us in this regard? When we consider we share up to 99% of our genes with primates and mice, for that matter, should they have similar conscious experience to us? The evidence suggests that they don't; our consciousness is human-specific. Studies show that gene expression in organs such as heart and liver are very similar between humans and, for example, chimpanzees. However, the brain is a different story. To date, there are about 169 genes found to exhibit expression differences between humans and chimp cortexes. 91 of these genes are human-specific. However, where genes are shared neurologically, the differences relate to high levels of expression in humans and chimps. The higher activation of consciousness, uh, is, is (ph)at a result of elevated gene expression. In the model we're talking about, the higher expressed shared examined to date influence hormones, neural growth factors, neurotransmitters, cytokines and interlukins and the neuroimmune system. The upregulation of so many genes indicate that we have a higher level of neuronal activity and metabolic process compared to primates. This in part helps explain the differences between performance between human and chimp brains and at best, it's only a part explanation of the biology of consciousness. So to talk about some of these genes, uh, you know, we, we'll not probably go through all of them in detail, cuz there's a lot there. However, there are a class of immediate response genes uh, thought really important. Um, for metabolism function, you're gonna see some up there. I'll leave the graphic up there for a bit longer for you to have a look, and um, brain plasticity, consciousness, memory learning behavior is thought to be better of 100 immediate response genes that have been discovered so far, which are thought important for that, and uh, dreaming, reconstruction of fear, stress and trauma . . . Uh, this is one in thought, very important for uh, uh, anxiety and um, perhaps even learning and recovery, and it's Zif-268 and it's the subject of much research interest. There are probably other, many other genes involved with this as well, but this one's thought to be important. Chronic psychosocial stress and uh, alternate gene expression, and we can see, like, uh, acetylcholinesterase can metabolize into uh, a um, different forms, which can actually be harmful for the brain if it occurs for long periods. They're there as short term, stress adaptive solutions, and um, and likewise, uh, other factors are upregulated which are helpful to adapt with stress and some of the genes that are involved with that. Far as the brain's immune system goes, there are some genes involved. They're important clock and behavioral state genes. There are about 100 sleep-related genes. Um, there are some clock period genes, and they might be considered immediate response genes as well, and of course, maternal behavior and touch genes, and there's a couple of well-known ones there. So now that we've had a bit of a snapshot of some of those genes that are important for a variety of physiological, mental and emotional states and cognitive states, how do we kind of turn them on for change? So, in relation to psychotherapy, learning is the main mechanism. Changes in gene expression alter the strength of the dendritic and synaptic connections, as we talked about before. These structural changes, uh, then alter anatomical patterns of consciousness between nerve cells and the brain. In animal models, when exposed to novelty, uh, environmental enrichment and exercise, the Zif-268 gene is expressing, expresses during REM sleep. Uh, as we said before, Zif-268 is a immediate response gene and a behavioral state gene that's associated with the generation of proteins, growth factors involved with plasticity. Uh, is this the trigger gene for neuroplasticity? Uh, we don't know for sure, but it's well-worth a nap in this case, because uh, after learning, uh, perhaps even after watching this presentation, a nap increases retention, and uh, could it be a Zif-268 in action? So now, we're gonna look at chronic stress and alternate gene pathways and structural changes. Acetylcholine is an important neural memory transmitter and it can take a different synthesis pathway in stress and trauma states. Chronic stress and trauma is associated with disturbed circadian rhythms, change in cholinergic gene expression and changes in acetylcholine and acetylcholinesterase metabolism, and this is found in, for example, post-traumatic stress disorder. Make . . . And the result is a unique form of MRNA in acetylchol-, uh, cholinesteras R, uh, and it's a stress modulator in the hippocampus. We mentioned before that some of these naturally occurring neurotransmitters involved in function alter their form as a, as a short term adaption or uh, or stress support functions for the neurons, uh, and it's quite okay if that's a temporary thing. However, over-expression can damage the hippocampus and may be a risk factor for glial cancer which is a very aggressive form of brain tumor. So you're getting the idea that over-expression can damage neurons through uh, creating hyper-excitatory states and probably inflammation, and probably the inflammation comes first before the (ph)exotic (ph)toxicity states develop. It affects the CREB, uh, the transcription factor that downregulates genes related to plasticity memory and learning and affects brain function, so we're seeing brain metabolism is getting to trouble, and then interferes with the 90 to 120 minute uh, rhythms of sleep, and creates an over-expression of cortisol, and uh, it's well-known that uh, elevated cortisol is a risk factor many types of disease and diabetes, heart disease. Um, it uh, it's a stress (ph)adaptional hormone; it's great for short periods of time, um, but over-expression of it creates all sorts of physiological changes which are unhelpful and in terms of our brains, uh, it's thought to cause hippocampal shrinkage, atrophy - we lose volume of the hippocampus (ph)when (ph)the associated impairment of learning and memory that goes along with hippocampal atrophy. Remember, in hippocampus is thought to be the, the central memory center of the body, or the brain. Uh, it's certainly the big relay station of memory uh, and has memory functions in itself; t's a very important structure for memory. So the evidence for structural changes in the brain in animals and humans, uh, animals for example, rats exposed to complex social environments create more synapses per neuron, and uh, these remain for at least 30 days after the complex social environment was removed and, and uh, and was also significantly different to uh, the control group. It was just rats living in paired, where they had some company, or individual housing, so it was quite a big difference. Uh, the social complexity, uh, created far more um, dendritic activity, synaptic uh, synapses per neuron. So for humans, a higher number of social contacts and richness of social environment lessens the risk of dementia in elderly people. Once again, building and reserve through plasticity. Listening to music helps create and strengthen more dendritic connections, and the auditory processing in remote areas of the brain. For example, the famous Mozart effect, where exposure increases cognitive and motor abilities. Uh, the Mozart effect is strongest in children, uh, more so than in adults, and is thought to be the 60 beat per minute of Mozart activates brain hemispheres and strengthens the corpus collosum, so, if you like, it's uh, causing a lot of uh, signalling between hemispheres, which strengthens up the connections between the brain. So what areas of the brain does psychotherapy genetically influence? Does medication help provide an answer? Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to alter some of the same biological mechanisms, uh, which are affected typically by medications. Anti-depressant medication response is associated with a 5% to 20% reduction in thyroid hormone level. A similar reduction in thyroid hormone level has been shown in treatment responders to 20 weeks, uh, 20 sessions, I should say, of CBT, uh, for those who achieve symptom remission, so for those patients who got better. And increased thyroid levels have been found in patients who did not respond to CBT, so while any role for thyroid hormone in depression is, really remains unknown, it does appear to be a marker of depression improvement. So the effects of psychotherapy can also be examined through scans. Studies have used positronic emission tomography, or PET scans of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, uh, before and after they receive two months of behavioral therapy and compared it with patients who are receiving medication. You can see the two different scans with the pre and post brains, and you can see in the post brains, there's uh, you can see lowered rates of activation, and we'll have a talk about the areas. It's a little bit hard to discern from the graphic, but there's uh, uh, areas of the brain not burning up as much glucose, which means they've quieted down, uh, but in detail, the scan shows decreased glucose metabolic activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and the right caudate after the therapy; um, medication worked about the same in the control group, medication group, sorry. The orbitofrontal cortex is part of the brain system that signals us that something is wrong in the environment or it's a threat. It may also be the case that in OCD, the excessive metabolic activity of this part of the brain represents faulty error signals that distort the perception and interpretation of threat factors in the environment. That simply means that that section of the brain is reading everything as a threat that's going on around them rather than not activating to these keys as threats. Interestingly, a theme of CBT is to reduce distorted thinking around environmental cues in OCD, so it's interesting, that physiology, neurology fits in nicely with the target of the therapy. For depression, 15 to 20 sessions of CBT has been shown to increase metabolic activity in the hippocampus and anterior cingulate and decrease uh, metabolic activity in the dorsal, ventral and medial frontal cortices in the people who respond. When compared to medication, antidepressant users experience uh, metabolic activity increases in prefrontal cortex and decreases in the brain stem and the subgenual cingulated. Although CBT and antidepressants were found to improve depression around the same level, they appear to activate different brain circuits. It may explain why therapy can offer, uh, have a better relapse prevention profile than medications, in some cases. We can see here the difference between the depressed brain and non-depressed brain. In this case, we're seeing an upregulation in activity, which is what we're wanting to see. So which treatment is beat? The research that has looked at this stuff is primarily focused on CBT or behavioral therapy. Does that mean that CBT is the best psychoneuro approach to therapy? The good news is this is not the case. Many meta analyses have concluded that all relatively short term therapy approaches have similar effect sizes, which means they'll work about the same. There's intriguing evidence, though, however, that for more serious psychiatric and chronic mental health problems that psychodynamic and psychoanalytic therapy may have special efficacy. For example, with serious mental health problems, it appears that psychoanalytically-orientated treatment may be better. For example, once a week versus three times a week for 3.5 years was found to create a 50 and 72% increase in significant improvement of symptoms, respectively. The studies examining long term psychoanalytic therapy have been criticized for methodological reasons and more research is obviously needed. However, it can be concluded from these studies that length and intensity of therapy is important for treating more serious mental health problems. From a neuroplasticity point of view, this makes a lot of sense, if you want to change strong pre-existing neuropathways and networks. So once again, back to CBT. CBT and early schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is marked by impairment to cognition that limit the effect of current treatments and recovery. The evidence to date suggests a variety of neurobiological pathologies that contribute to cognitive impairment, such as progressive loss of gray matter, uh, frontal hypo function, decreased white matter integrity in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus, which have been linked to neurocognitive impairment in memory and executive function. Likewise, abnormalities in the medial temporal and medial frontal brain networks include the amygdala fusiform gyru and orbitofrontal cortex and that these have been implicated in the social cognitive impairment and perspective taking seen in schizophrenia. All these impairments that we've talked about typically don't respond well to pharmacology. Pharmaco is quite good for reducing negative symptoms, though. Uh, psychosocial cognitive rehabilitation programs have demonstrated efficacy in addressing some of these cognitive impairments, and this is where it gets quite interesting, and a study that showed this very, very well, I think's a very important study, uh, intensive cognitive enhancement therapy, which focused specifically on attention, memory and problem solving and social training provided, has provided the people early in their course of their schizophrenic illness, so it was early in the diagnosis, and uh, and they compared that to the group who didn't receive the therapy, who just received standard treatment, and significantly greater gray matter was preserved over the two-year period in the hippocampus, perahippocampal gyrus and fusiform gyrus and gray matter increased in the left amygdala compared to the control group, who received supportive therapy in addition to standard medication. They experienced gray matter loss. So the cognitive enhancement therapy was not only neuroprotective and preserved brain tissue, it was associated with much better uh, long term positive cognitive outcomes. So in therapy, we know that working alliance is really important, or the relationship is very important for outcome. In fact, it predicts outcome more strongly than the therapy approach. So is there a neurobiological explanation for the relationship between patient and therapist, um, and we've heard some preliminary ideas about mirror neurons and mirrored empathic states and things. This research takes a little bit further. The five-year study monitored brain activity during therapy sessions has shown that two people can become physiologically aligned with parts of their nervous system synchronizing despite having no physical contact with each other, and in this study, it was a peered study, cuz it was a long term one and quite complex, and they put electrodes around the heads of the therapist and the, and the clients and heart monitors and, and uh, skin response conductance resonance uh, monitors on them, so they're wired up. You (ph)can imagine doing therapy like that, but that was great that they did that. And they were looking for physiological moments of oneness in the therapy, so when the expression of these measures aligned between two people, the client and the therapist, their monitoring showed a heightened activity in the parietal part of the brain, which is considered to be the seat of imagination; uh, it is the alignment between two people that's proposed to be the mechanism that allows the deep feeling of connection. Uh, the researcher said that this is simply being a reaction between equivalent neurons, such as the mirror neuron argument, regarding what's being discussed in an empathic state. What actually happened is the (ph)dissonance would (ph)turn into alignment with each other, regardless of the discussion, so these moments of alignment, or this alignment that developed between the client and the therapist physiologically wasn't associated with what was being discussed, um, and in fact, it began with the presence, when two people came into presence with each other. For a lot of people, those alignments began to occur automatically. Uh, it led the researchers to say a way of understanding this is that my energy impacts with you standing there; you know, I'm impacting on your brain and body just by being here with you, and these things start to occur, which is a fascinating outcome for the research. So the, this thinking around the study is that the parietal part of the, parietal lobes are, is activated and parietal lobe activation has been studied in consciousness research for quite some time, and is thought to be a candidate for uh, sixth sense-like abilities and hyper intuition and things like that. When activated in relationship with others, it allows us to read each other's brains and bodies at a deeper level, so it adds to our understanding of others, uh, and at that intuitive level that develops between people. This process may not be devoid of microcommunication factors, as probably nothing is, and it's been known for some time that visual language cues in therapy may result in the alignment of some autonomic nervous system processes. Some scientists believe that the uh, physiological alignment is required for successful therapy, and it might be a part of what we actually understand as the relational construct of the working alliance that we mentioned before. So the implications for psychological treatment: therapy begins as soon as intentional focus is created, and it's aided through the alignment or alliance with the therapist. This means that data gathering, exploration of issues and assessment is not independent of the treatment. Immediate response genes are activated simply by being in the presence of the therapist, beginning the discussion, discussing painful feelings, issues and experiences of relief or distress. The extent to which neuroactivation is achieved depends on the quality and the quantity of the therapy. So there are some things to consider. Reconstruction of memory and learning deactivates stress-induced pathways and stimulates growth factors to use higher learning and memory functions to deal with issues, thereby enhancing or rehabilitating hippocampal function and higher cognitive function through our neuroplasticity mechanism. So understanding and resolving conflicts or working with negative core beliefs may be particularly important in this model for a neuroplastic uh, response. It's reasonable to hypothesize that we may be influencing gene expression not just involved with mental health but also physical health, so we can be confident that our reach goes, uh, beyond simply the thoughts, and it makes sense; if (ph)we're (ph)lowering stress levels, we'd be decreasing cortisol levels and other stress hormones. People are likely to receive improved health. So some practical tips: we must have sufficient psychological arousal in the session to facilitate immediate response gene activation, so patients must engage, you know, and uh, you think about working with trauma. It relies on arousal, and that, uh, other bodies of therapy rely on deep engagement. It's an idea not foreign to psychotherapy theory. Uh, interesting this research shows that 90 minutes may be optimal for a session from a neuroplasticity point of view. The brain has a basic rest cycle of 90 to 120 minutes, just like in sleep, and the information between the mind and the genes that involve hormones, mess-, messenger molecules that trigger other gene expression via the blood stream takes place every 90 to 120 minutes. In reality, 90 minutes is too long; um, we don't do that. It probably is too intense for therapists. It probably activates too many of our own systems. However, uh, we've all come across patients who do better if they have somewhat longer sessions, and it may well be this factor is part of that. Sleep's really important in this model for behavior change, so we need to ensure quality of sleep to facilitate maximum neuroplasticity from therapy sessions. Repetition and practice is very important as well, as the more one does it, the more it generates brain-derived neurotrophic factor and activates neuroplasticity, uh, so practice, practice, practice. Exercise, as an adjunct, it's a powerful stimulator of neurotrophins and neuroplasticity. Exercising (ph)dependently does that. Um, nutrition, uh, good healthy diets . . . There's plenty of uh, research that shows that the right type of fatty acids, the right type of nutrients, a lot of polyphenols from berries and other super healthy foods, uh, have an independent effect on uh, neuroplasticity through stimulated neurotrophic factors, and just to convince you exercise is important, uh, is a graphic that looks at uh, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, uh, expression in an exercising group and a sedentary group, and you see significantly higher in the exercising group, and you can see the hippocampus is uh, far more metabolically active, so it's a healthier memory center, if you like, through exercise, and it should encourage us all to go for a nice long walk. So the conclusion is that, at this stage of behavior change, uh, we don't have, uh, that, that research that hasn't really provided enough evidence or major discoveries to revolutionize psychotherapy. Probably what we can really take away from this is considerable reassurance that psychotherapy is a powerful intervention that influences our very genetic code and assists in our understanding of how therapy may work, and encourages us as practitioners to think more broadly about treatments as a mind-body intervention. Here are some suggested readings for those who would like to take it a bit further, and I'd like to thank you for watching and listening to this presentation.
