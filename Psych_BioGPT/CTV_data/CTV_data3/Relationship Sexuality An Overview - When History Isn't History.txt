PAT LOVE Hello. I'm Dr. Pat Love of Pat Love and Associates, college professor, long time relationship consultant and private practitioner. So, let's… can… let's look at sexuality and how your history affects your sexuality and your, let's say, behavior and enjoyment in relationships. Because what we know is sometimes history isn't history. Sometimes history isn't history, what do I mean by that? When it comes to sex, we know human sexuality is complex, we know one size doesn't fit all, we have a lot of variance between people, even in your… throughout your lifespan, there's a lot of variance in how you express and how you experience sexuality. We know that some approaches work some of the time with our clients, but not all approaches work all of the time. And we know it's important, again, to listen to the client, to keep… to let them know we're smart by staying up… updated with research and that our treatment makes sense with them. We know that people are on a continuum. Given your hand of horno… hormones, we know that you may have a high testosterone person in a relationship with a low testosterone person. And we know that some people, for some people, monogamy is so easy. In fact, it's so easy, you get attached to one person and it's hard to let go regardless of how they treat you. So, we know that there's a continuum around hormones, there's a continuum around monogamy, and there's also a continuum around how comfortable you are with sexuality and erotic material in general. So, it's not just genetics though, is it? It's not just the hand that you've been dealt in terms of hormones or your early experience. Sometimes it's epigenetics, and that is the culture you grew up in, the forces that played on your genetic material that may have turned certain parts of your DNA on or off. So, we want to look at epigenetics. What do I mean about that? Well, we know that for example, let me just go back here to… let me go back one thing here. When history isn't history, what am I talking about? I'm talking about these… this… it's the epigenetic factors that show up when you answer yes to any of these questions. And I want you just to think for a moment what it's like when you… if you grew up, if… if… just think of this would be a yes. And by the way, the operative word is did a parent or adult "often," not that this happened once or twice, but was this a… a general occurrence, a common occurrence? Did someone swear, insult or humiliate you? And you start to think about this and how this might affect you and your self-image, and your sexuality. Push, grab, slap, throw something, or hit you, was that part of your experience? Is that a yes or a no? Make you feel unwanted, you know, or unimportant. Did a person five years or older touch you in a sexual way? You know, where you didn't have a choice because of their… of the age difference and the power differential. Were you neglected in terms of care or food or protection? Did a parent die or leave? Did you witness physical abuse of a family member? Vicarious trauma from watching a family member abused. Did you live with alcohol or drug abuse? Did you live with depression or mental illness, someone in your family? Did anyone in your household go to prison? So, you begin to look at these genetic factors and we know from a very large study this constitutes an ACE score, which is Adverse Childhood Experiences. And depending upon your ACE score, you might fit in one of these categories. Thirty… This was a 17,000 person study. And these were basically middle class, employed individuals. So, 36% said no, none of that ever happened to me, 25% said yeah, 16, 2; 10, 3; 13% were 4 and above. Now, why is this important? We know that adversity affects emotional regulation. And adversity, having this early experience, and what… why… let me give it a different name, let's just call it "trauma," 'cause I want to define trauma for you. Trauma is any real or perceived threat to survival. So, I want to use that working definition. Because remember, we're dependent longer than any species. A woman can't give birth to a child in the field and walk off, and the child rear itself. So, we have to have the care of another human being, first of all, to organize our brain. You know, you're born with a brain, but no mind. And so your brain gets organized by interaction and stimulation from other humans. So, we have to have this care to survive, but we also have to have the care to thrive. So… So, I think it's important to know that when you're seeing, if you're being neglected, if you're being abused, if you're being humiliated and ridiculed, if you see violence happening in your home, as a child because of your dependency, this feels life threatening. Now, you know, from an outside observer you might say, " Well, yes, you… you went without food that one day, but you're not going to starve in one day." But that's not the way it feels to the child. And, we know from research how that shows up later in life. It shows up in many ways, but the two ways I want to talk about that relate back to sexuality and comforting relationships are these two, your inability or your difficulty regulating your emotions. You probably know people or you've seen clients that once they get flooded, once they get anxious, once they get angry, that anger stays in the system for a long, long time before it dissipates. Or once they get hurt and they shut down and they pull away, it's like, honey, that door comes down. And it takes a long time to get back in for them to trust you again. That's what I'm talking about, and the ability to regulate your emotions to say, "Okay, wait a minute, that was then, this is now." I have a good line and I want to… I want to feed you this line because I hear… I hear myself saying it to my clients a lot, because feelings come on you. You don't even know sometimes where they come from. But, when a feeling comes on, I say to my client, "Feel the feeling, but do the right thing." And then… because if you feed that feeling and run with that feeling, it's going to get bigger and bigger and bigger, isn't it? So you can feel the feeling, but then you can choose how to act. And what's the "right thing?" The right thing is what fits with your core values, who you are, the kind of person you want to be, the kind of man you want to be, the kind of woman you want to be. So, you can feel the feeling, but do the right thing. Now you begin to see how when you overlay this inability to A, regulate your emotions. Like, if… if you and I are in a relationship and… and… and we want it to be a sexual relationship, we want it to be a healthy sexual relationship, but somehow I get hurt and I either get angry or shut down or pull away, you begin to see how the relationship and how I manage my emotions, number one, affects you, but also, it affects our sexual relationship. Because remember, half the population, when they feel stressed, they want to have more sex. The other half of the population, when they feel stressed, they literally can't have desire. And these two people are often in a relationship together. So you begin to see how when history isn't history, when your history is still affecting you, it can affect your sexual relationship. So, when you look at how they're related, how are they related? A 100%, I mean… and even if I'm more of that sexy-body person that walks around with a high desire and high testosterone, and I can have sex even if we're mad and angry, in fact, for me it's my favorite way to get over being angry, is let's have sex, you know. If I'm… If I'm that way but my partner isn't, I have to be able to cross that bridge into my partner's world and have compassion and be understanding, because I'm here to tell you emotional regulation and sexual desire are distinctly related, they're definitely related. And for half the population, most women, some men, almost a third of men, they have to have their stress lowered, they have to have their emotions, there's… you know, in a calmer state to feel desire. They might be aroused. You can be lubricated, have an erection, but you won't feel desire. Because desire for half the population is about having that… remember that, you know, you have to have this calmness for half the population to be in connection. So, if you're on that continuum that I mentioned earlier with the hormones, high testosterone people, they say, "We can have sex if we're mad." But the person who are more estrogen dominant, say it's about the relationship. That's why one size doesn't fit all. Okay. So, they are definitely related. Now that's one continuum, you know, where you are on your ACE score, Adverse Childhood Experiences. There's another continuum I want you to think about. I hope you never ask about childhood history, family of origin, the trauma, the difficulties that a per… your clients have without asking about resilience. I personally think as helpers, we have to believe in post-traumat… post-traumatic strength as much as post-traumatic stress. You read a whole lot more in the literature about PTS, post-traumatic stress. But we also have to believe in post traumatic strength. In fact, there is even a concept called stress induced resilience. We have to know that we're very resilient as humans. Just because I have a high ACE score doesn't mean I can't have a healthy sex life. It may mean I have to understand to be able to separate some of the experiences, but it doesn't mean I can't have a healthy sex life. Okay, so here are the resilience questions. I you want to ask yourself, did you feel loved by a child, as… by anybody? Were there relatives that helped when you needed them? As a child, were there neighbors, friends or parents who liked you? You know, I had a bed in about three different homes from first grade to high… through high school, in my friends' homes where I was welcome and I could spend the night. Were their teachers, coaches, youth or religious leaders that were there to guide you and help you? This makes a difference, it makes a difference. You know, it does take a village, doesn't? And sometimes it's the village that offsets those adverse childhood experiences. And by the way, what I love, you know, research around, umm… secured attachment says that… that if you grew up without a good enough parenting, you know, good enough care giving, that… and you grow up with this and you come into adulthood and you're insecurely attached, you know, maybe you're anxious, maybe you're pursuant, you cling and hold on too much or you're avoidant and you shut down and you move away. You know, if you don't have secure attachment, research says there are three ways you can… you can get that. One is being with a loving, caring, patient, kind partner, that's agreeable. And had… can regulate his or her emotions. So a partner can do it, a love partner, you know. Number two, friends can actually do it. You know, friends… I often credit my friends for saving my life and bringing me into secure attachment. I give my friends so much credit. But you know what's number three? Therapy. Isn't that cool? Isn't it cool that we get to be a part of the helping, not the hurting? For people who are hurting, we get to be a part of the healing. We get to be a part of the helping. So… And these are questions we want to be asking. Someone in my family cared about how I was doing in school. There were rules in my home and the expectation to follow them. You know, did you have rules? They may have been different than other kids' rules, but if you had rules and an expectation to follow them. See, those rules… I often… when I'm coaching parents, "No" is a good word. Your job is to provide protection, to put the protective boundaries around the kids. If a kid's in charge of the family, the family is in trouble, family is in trouble. So, you know, that's why there were rules and I was expected to follow them. That's externally important. So, when I felt bad, I could almost find someone to talk to. Did you have someone you could go to? You know, you may not have had a parent at home or a caregiver. Did you have a grandparent? Did you have a neighbor? Did you have an older friend? Did you have a religiously… or a leader or a teacher? Did you have someone that you could go to? Because you can imagine being a kid and being… being dependent and feeling like you were on your own, you know, wow. You can see how overwhelming that can be and how it starts then to translate into a lack of trust in relationships. I personally can remember the day, the time, the place when I decided, and this was third grade, to not feel anymore. I just… I just decided I'm not going to feel, I'm not going to hurt and I shut off feelings. My favorite line as an adolescent was, "I don't care, I don't care," because I… I withdrew, I shut down. And you can just imagine how difficult that has been, you know, I'm grateful for therapy and friends and, you know, patient partners over the years. But the truth is you can imagine how shutting down, not trusting starts to translate into sexuality. You don't trust yourself, you let the wrong people in, you keep the wrong people out. So if you think these, you know, history isn't history, if you think that's not connected to sexuality, it's connected to all parts of our life, whether it's homework, etcetera. So, if you could find someone to talk to. And here's a good one I thought, there were people who thought I could get things done. I like that, which is competency. If you don't feel competent… I remember a couple in my office, it was a gay couple and the man said, "I don't…" one of the partner said, "I don't… I don't initiate any new technique, you know. My partner wants more adventure in our sex life. I don't… I don't initiate anything new because I'm… I'm afraid I can't perform. I'm afraid that I will fail." And failure was his worst nightmare. I mean, if you didn't have some people who thought you could get things done, and how do you get things done? Sometimes you fail, don't you? And you learn from those mistakes and you try again. That's what courage is, is as you get up when you're afraid and you do it anyway. So, you begin to see how these old patterns really can show up and why it's important not just to talk about adversity, but we've got to give our clients hope. I was a go-getter as a kid. Could you get things done? As a kid I believe life is what you make it. So, we've got to ask positive questions, because so often that… that when you… when you talk about childhood and you say, "Oh, well, that's why I'm failing in my sex life, that's why I'm failing in my relationships or at work, it's because of my childhood." How hopeless is that? We've got to give people a ladder to climb out of that darkness of despair, and resilience. And you can build resilience anytime in your life. By the way, this is also a list for strategies. Where do you start if you want to build resistance? What… What gave you resilience as a young person, still works today? So again, this is why I love research because it tells me where to go in… in helping people. Okay. Now there's another continuum. And this one is a continuum that… from connection to protection. We know that we're born with an instinct to connect. I remember when my granddaughter was born and she was just actually minutes old, and I was holding her, and her dad who has this booming voice, walked over and he said, "Hello, beautiful." And Katie just turned her face and looked, it was just, oh, it's one of those moments. Why is that? First of all, she'd been hearing his voice, you know, and she recognized the voice. But human beings are programmed for connection because we have the habit to survive. If I can't engage you, if I can't… you know, get you to pay attention to me and my needs, my… my… my likelihood of surviving is like slim and none, right. So, we are born with an instinct to connect. We're also depender… dependent longer than any other species. I mentioned this, but I want to go over it because it's not that we care for each other. You know, there are whale babies that stay with their mothers, you know, all their life. But we're dependent. And because of this dependency, we adapt our behavior to try to get along. You go along to get along. And you have to start looking at how you win along to get along in your family, because the very coping strategies that saved your life early in life are the ones that can become highly inconvenient in relationships and in adulthood. We're relational creatures. The human brain is experience-dependent. You're born with a brain, but no mind, it doesn't get wired without human contact. Neural circuits are formed through inter-personal experiences, and you can change… we still change one another's brains. We still change one another's brains. Now, connection doesn't always go perfectly. Does it? So I want you to think about, if you're in a relationship and this is an important relationship to you, and conflict comes up, what's one way that you protect yourself? Anybody? Okay. 

00:20:30
UNKNOWN I kind of just withdraw. 

00:20:30
PAT LOVE Withdraw. So you just… that's number one. So many of us, sort of, shut down, withdraw, maybe, you know, close my mouth, maybe… I… the other day, I… I felt myself something happened and I just went… like that and I withdrew emotionally. I took my mind somewhere else. And so you begin to see some people do withdraw, they shut down. Some people fight, they are in your face. Deny, placate, please, freeze. All of these coping strategies helped you from becoming overwhelmed early in life. You did what you had to do to get… to get by and to stay safe. But the very coping strategy that saves your life psychically can become highly inconvenient in adulthood. And so this is why "follow your feelings" is a bad advice, because feelings are rooted in history, and you probably learned that pattern because it worked for you maybe eight years old or younger. But you've got to feel the feeling, but do the right thing. And the right thing may be, I feel… I realize I just walked away. And you go back and you say, "I realize I walked away and I know when I walk away. You get so angry and I've promise you I'm not going to do that." I mean, you might not do it like that. But you feel the feeling because it's going to come, isn't it? Instantaneously. But you don't let that feeling regulate and guard and predict your behavior. You feel the feeling, but you do the right thing. And the right thing may be, "Yes, I feel like shutting down right now, but I know this is an important relationship to me and I want to be in this relationship." And you step back and look at it from the moon. And you say, okay, you know, "From this height, what should I be doing down there? This is somebody I love, this is important." So, yes, I can feel like withdrawing, I can honor the feeling, but do the right thing, whether you feel like it or not. And that's why we know, fake it till you make it is often really good advice. Okay. Once we learn to protect ourselves, the protection is difficult to release because we resist the most that which we want and need the most. This is why therapists have to go to therapy. We often have to outsource our… our objectivity because the human brain is so, so subjective about you. The other thing is we have two types of memory. Explicit memory comes with recall. That was then this is now. If I say, "What did you eat for breakfast?" You can tell me what you ate. You know you're not eating breakfast right now. You get a picture of it. But implicit memories are very different. They come with sensations only and no recall. So all of a sudden, I'm feeling scared and I don't even know why. And these implicit memories are highly susceptible to context. So, it can be just a look from your partner, or it can be that your partner was admiring a handsome guy walking by or girl walking by, it can trigger something in you and you don't even know why. Or it could be the smell of grass, and that was the first time you found out she was unfaithful, and all of a sudden, you shut down and you don't even know why, because implicit memories come with sensations and no recall. Context and experience can affect your sexual response. And you say, "Well, how did we ever get together at all? How did we ever get together at all?" And it's because of infatuation. Infatuation is nature's way of lowering our defenses and during this time, non-talkers talk, non-touchers touch, all your defenses are lowered. And you can see that it has an arc. It actually… we're looking at three to six months for the big hit, and we know that during this time you're talking, you're sensual, you're sexual and it all feels so natural. This is… This is the time when we override our avoidance. We don't shut down, we talk, you know, all through the night. You know, we don't get angry, we're impatient instead. So, this is nature's way of getting us together, to meet, mate, procreate and begin to pair… pair bond. And so this period of time is like… all whole… you know all rules don't apply. It's can also be affected by the relationship, I think that goes without saying. In summary, sex is triggered by incentives in the environment. You know, sometimes it's the… it's the location. Umm… Stimulation acts on our internal memories and interpretations. It's going to fit in to a logging system that we developed many years ago. It's sensitized by sex hormones, monitored by our beliefs. And many times these forces too are at war with one another. But here's the good news. Even though we're at war within ourselves, you and I get to be the peacemakers. And that's why I love this field. So, now I want to ask, are there any questions? 

00:25:50
UNKNOWN I had one. What type of techniques do you use in working with a client who's finding that their history is getting in the way of being able to have a meaningful relationship now? 

00:26:00
PAT LOVE Oh, that's a good question. What type of techniques do I use when a client's history is getting in the way of having a meaningful relationship? First of all, I want to go back and reiterate because remember rule number one, to help people is we've got to understand them. So, how I prepare for every session, and it really is an answer to this question is, I get myself in a place for attunement. And that means I am really focusing on you. And so, I'm watching your every move, and so I want to regulate my emotions to make it safe for you. So, one technique is attunement. I'm really going to tune in to the client to… so that I'll know, wait a minute, this sounds more like history, you know, this sounds like an old pattern, this sounds like a non-sequitur with what's going on in the room. It's almost like a piece of the puzzle is missing. So, you would say, in a way it's like you're stalled(ph). I'm thinking, "Wait, this doesn't fit with this, you're stalled(ph), that all these pieces, this is incongruent behavior." So I'm attuned, you know, I'm thinking for immediacy which is what is happening right now, that's… that's a technique. And so, and then number… number two, I want to create safety, as I said, by regulating my emotions. You know, like, I may have to take deep breaths or just, sort of, calm myself if the client's getting very upset, and it's… it's an overreaction to what's happening in the session. And then I might say to the client, for example, "I want you to get in touch with what you're feeling right this moment, and I am going to ask you just to close your eyes. And I want you to make that emotion as strong as you can make it", so attunelization here. "And I want you to go back, back, all the way back to the earliest time you could ever remember feeling anything even remotely like this. I want you to free associate. Don't try to make it make sense. Back, back. And when you have… when a picture or a memory flashes in your mind, just nod your head let me… let me know." And so I just wait patiently and I might do that a little slower, you know, and when a client nods her head or his head, I say, "I'm going to ask you to open your eyes and tell me the picture that came in," or if this is a couple, I say, "I am going to get you to open your eyes and tell your partner." If there's safety in the relationship, you know, I would… I would make a clinical judgment, what that was like. Because I want to start to separate that was then, this is now. We're going to name it to tame it. So, I'm going to say, that was then. So you feel that feeling. So when that feeling comes up, you say, "Oh, that's my dad's stuff." "That's my step-mom's stuff." "Oh, that's the teacher stuff." And you honor it and you feel the feeling and do the right thing. What's the right thing? It's going to take you back to your core values, your core value maybe loving or kind or creative or smart. And I would say, what would a kind person do? Feel the feeling and let it take you to your core value. Strongest feelings are designed to take us back to our finest self, our core value. So, I want to actually reprogram that feeling that comes from history and able… and enable it to take you to your finest behavior in the present. So, that's how one way I use history. And that makes history, history.
