CAMILLO LORIEDO Ladies and gentlemen, it's a pleasure and it's an honor, ah, to introduce to you Erving Polster, ah, one of the giant figures of the Gestalt approach of psychotherapy. Ah, Erving is also one of the people who was present to all the evolution of psychotherapy conference is from the very beginning. I think for us and the foundation it's, ah, ah, kind of a milestone, it's very important for us. And, ah, also he did a five different books. And he's now preparing another book. Ah, the name will be Focus of Evolution, ah, and, ah, I think, ah, ah, I will lie to say that I'm very grateful for the teaching that they gave, ah, all the world around, in Italy included since it's a very long time. So thank you for presenting here. Erving.

ERVING POLSTER In the, in the first, ah, evolution conference I was, uhm, it's a, 63 years old. And it-- it was, ah, I don't remember exactly where it was but I think it was Phoenix. Can you understand me okay? And, ah, they had, ah, two hotels, ah, one was, ah, closer to where the meetings were gonna be then the other. And, uhm, I was in the distant hotel because I was one of the younger people.

ERVING POLSTER I know, I know that all of you upon coming to this conference were thinking to yourself, I hope at last that somebody there will read a paper instead of-- cuz I love re-- here. I love here and people read papers. And I hate extemporaneous and spontaneous fe-- fl-- flourishing of the mind. And, ah, and so those of you who felt that way you have locked in because I have a paper here and I would read it because I believe that I can get when I wanna get across better to you in this particular limited about our time then I would by just speaking extemporaneously with-- would, would be more fun to do maybe if I ever got to the point. But in reading it I-- my heart is in it so I'm not gonna-- just gonna read it casually. Bu-- but I want you to bear with me and when it's over, we are gonna be extemporaneous. Je-- Jean would have heard us-- her remarks and we'll have a discussion and questions. And, ah, it will be like old times. Okay, today I wanna offer a rationale for psychotherapy to expand beyond its familiar problem solving purposes, practice in offices into the creation of lifelong fo-- life-focused communities. I will describe three major premises that le-- that laid up a society or need for such groups. First is the idea the everybody is faced everyday with more than they can assimilate and needs to catch up with is left behind. Second, the idea-- is the idea that psychotherapy transpose its original medical mission to change people's troubled lives into a portrayal of their lives. Third is the idea that people are i inherently driven to pay attention to their lives, do it all the time and are extraordinarily fascinated with doing it. The first idea, catching up with what we leave behind. There's plenty to catch up with as life is composed of a stream of events, one irrepressibly following another. Think of each 24-hour day as having 86,400 seconds. I counted them. Each moment of that-- each moments of event form is moving into the next moment in a representative day we wake up in the morning, eat breakfast bite after bite, talk with the family, imagine the day ahead, run into friends and colleagues wonder about decisions to be made perhaps even philosophies about life purposes. We read books and newspapers, we drive to streets, we receive phone calls, and we make them, we go to parties, everything that happens contributes to the complexity of staying tune in. Of course, it will all go on whether we stay tuned in or not. But the surface stimulation then leaves us with an inventory of the unattended. Residing silently in the background of our lives. Most of us live pretty well with that soaking in when we can. Much of what is left out however lies restlessly and readiness available for arousal. That arousal was hardly assured and many people me-- maybe most people need a special place, special time, and a special frame of mind to register what it bypassed and life flow. They need specially to mind-- designed communal opportunity that serves almost like a Sabbath to tap into an otherwise fleeting event from us. In a recent novel Barbara Kingsolver opens a window and do the sideline lives of rural parishioners. Bobby, the minister is talking to the people in the congregation encourages them to catch up to what they have left behind. He says, "What do you wanna, ah, ah, a-- what do you want? What I wanna ask you is right now what do you-- what do you want? What do you love? What is going-- what is the good Lord bestowed on your home and family that has brought grace into you life?" One person says, "My little grand baby Haley(ph)." My, my-- the minister spotlights this feeling by saying to his people. "I want everyone here to covenant with sister Rachel(ph)." The room does indeed warm up to Rachel's(ph) story and then when she has said what she wanted to say, another person tells about his daughter Gil(ph) getting over cancer, and how you loves her pretty yellow hair. The story of gratitude and his tears further warmed up the room. Then there was one surprise after another, as people poured out their experiences, at Newport Deck with the view of the sunset, a wedding of a disabled cousin, a pure white cat. All of these stories are commonplace realities is a part of everyday living. Sadly, they are often lost as people on their own just take life and stride selling personal momentum, letting-- letting personal momentum guide them sliding rightly-- riding slightly, ah, above the dimly realized treasures of their existence.

ERVING POLSTER The lighting is not the greatest for a man with my kind of vision. Psychotherapy ki-- professionals can expand on Bobby's exploration of his church members live-- performing live focus community groups. These groups write a psychotherapy ethos in a broad range of themes designed to help people get of the conveyer belt of worldly insistence, to reveal and assimilate what is happening the landscape of their lives. They highlight their themes of everyday living including the grammar of family relationships. The ups and downs of competition, the inspiriting effects of secret goals or any of the various ways of personal enlightenment. One group for example explored the theme of home.

1. ERVING POLSTER They did. Breaking into small groups, the members listened to a heartwarming song, the song about home then spoke to each other about their own experiences of home. One person said, "I hope I can do this without crying. But I don't know if I can. It was really meaningful to me because I came across the ocean 14 years ago full of excitement to stay here for one year and go back home. It didn't work out that way. I met a man who persuaded me to stay but I made a-- promise me two things, that there would always be money in the bank for me to go home and for me to be buried at home. I was panicked at the idea of dying in the country which says nothing about America, were the life I made but it is a strong longing for me to return home. And there came a time in my life that it didn't matter so much to me where I was buried and I thought it was crazy to think of it that way but now I'm 68. And I do wanna be buried at home. I don't know if it takes, ah, lo-- if it's a longing that is overwhelming, maybe it's a simple as there are people meet me in the cemetery and remember you and they enter your-- they enter you with flowers and they talk about you. But it's again, it's strong longing about going home." End quote. There is a flowering nowadays of people wanting in diverse ways to pay attention to the lives there living. We see it in mindfulness programs that are sweeping country, spiritualistic practices, and the vast variety of self-help groups and self-help books and in journalistic human interest stories that appear in book, newspapers, and magazines. We see the self-examining process in men's and women's groups, fer-- formed for people to talk to each other about their lives. We see also see the life focus need addressed in book clubs where discussions take people beyond their own lives, opening their minds to life as it lived by the novels characters who mirror key fundamentals of living. We see it in the commercial world where the formation of house-- in-house groups is flourishing bringing employees together to learn how to bring their emotions and attitude into their work. We see a new level of person to person exploration of religious organizations which had created many relational groups and retreats through which people are augmenting their more familiar worship formats. And these groups people are guided to talk to each other, telling each other about their concerns, ah, reflected in stories, about their lives, where God is commonly in the background of their orientation. They are more than ever directly engaged with each other, examining what they feel, what they think, what they hope, what they want. They offer expanded understanding and acceptance of each others feelings and they provide stimulation for self-expression. We also see wildly growing phenomenon of networking. Facebook alone has way over 600 million registered. And the company's annual revenue was over $4 billion. The numbers are fa-- monumental. The range of purposes is very broad, planning, reporting, requesting, celebrating, complaining, and expansion of opportunity for people to talk about things they might otherwise say to each other revealing their-- but, but they don't do it. They could but they don't. They are often very personal, revealing people's values, their ambitions, their animosities, and their lives. They tell each other about what is happening in their worlds and how it feels to be talking to each other. Clearly, we are seeking a commanding expansion of person to person conversation, a social eruption of new communal accessibility with such baby steps into the vastly growing potential for relational connectedness, it is too early to know the full implication of the benefits and the dangers. But what we already unequivocally find evident is the compelling need for people to join together to focus on how they are living their lives. Now, obviously, further attention is going require the right kind of formats and it's gonna require careful consideration of what's happening to people in these groups. But we have to start with the fact that they need it, they want it and they're gonna get it whatever way we go in terms of our own more responsible kind of planning. Now, onto the second part of what I wanna-- a point I wanna make that there is an innate need to look at one's life experience and that psychotherapy cultivated that need in its instrument of personal change. In, in its, in its, and is satisfying the need for personal change and use life focus as an instrument. However, because psychotherapy's medical purposes, the basic therapeutic enhancement of focus on the lives that we live it's been overwhelmed and overshadowed by the need for curing growth. So the need to change people's troubled lives has taken over from the instrument which is to focus on people's lives. The urgency of psychotherap-- psy-- psychological cures gave medical permission for the most penetrating explorations of the individual psyche in all of history. I'm trying to get the lighting to be right for me and so bear with me. I hope you're following me so far. Yeah? And if you felt no, would you say it? Yeah, okay. Thank you. All right. Ah, I wanna say that the urgency of psychological cures gave medical permission for the most penetrating explorations of the individual psyche in all of history. That is a lofty claim to me, considering the examples of dedicated attention to human experience among these we include Socratic dialogue, Early Christian confessional groups, ah, ancient mystery, religions using psychoactive drugs, religious prayers, shamanic healing, devotions of Christian monks, Zen Disciplines and many other forms of exploring how we live our lives. None of these matches the psychotherapist detailed attention to the ordinary person's life scenario. A step by steps rolling of the most intimate details of thought, feeling, action and memory. The conventional-- the conversational journey of psychotherapy has given meticulous attention to long forgotten experiences, some with traumatic implications, some just part of everyday living. Stories about bullying by an older brother says he remarks to a visiting aunt. A rescue from drowning or embarrassment at the untimely loss of bowel control. All these scenarios sketch out examples of a lifetime of determinitive-- determinative human experience. While the psychotherapist intention was to revive-- to reveal the sources of psychological trouble, what is commandingly overlooked is that these stories created much more than that. They were the markers of a lifetime but was masked by the unprecedented medical tracking was the remarkable ascendance of the psychotherapist as the cultural agent for a new dimension of focus-- of life focus grounded in an innately need to pay attention to one's life. And indispensable compliment to just living it. I remember the spell cast upon me in my first experience of therapy. In 1947, when, when my s-- psycho-- psychoanalyst listened attentively to me not only as he would have been haphazard conversational opportunity but for session after session. I told them about many experiences, some recent, some place done-- share long ago, some about the future which I looked at with only dim sense of impending novelty. But the stories all flowed out. What I still remember is the unprecedented freedom to unfold my life and how entranced I was in doing it. This man listened to it all no matter what I said, he listened no matter how many times I came back he'll still listen. I never had anyone listened to me so enduringly and with such absorption. Furthermore, I could tell he knew what I was talking about by his timely observations as though he was at home in my mind. My conversation teams received so large the measure of his attention that they took out an all together unfamiliar dimension of importance to me. First, his attention funneled into a new-- a new respect for what I was already saying. Secondly, and intend me forward in three trajectory for saying many things I would never otherwise have thought important enough or safe enough to say. What stayed most prominently in my mind, and what I have witnessed in the subsequent 60 years or more of my work as a therapist was the deep absorption that colors this mysteriously private setting. Even though we were just two people talking about the events of my life, and later because of my patience, and neither those of my patience this special environment which has highlighted attention was an invitation into a new world filled with experience. I had only the most innocent glimpse in those early days of what I see more clearly now, a primary fascination with the spotlighted aliveness. I doubt my medically oriented therapist saw this either. We look passed the enchantment of this engagement and package the experience in this-- in the wrapping of a professional healing. Oh, which it was. But it was so much more. The adventure of my advanced, ah, bu-- of my enhanced life focus was overshadowed by a targeted search from personal improvement instead of realizing I was in the grip of a biologically driven human need to explore the landscape of living, I sought as a practical though humanly rich medical instrument. A vehicle intended to modify this sym-- this symptomatic consequences of my inner most psychological dynamisms. This medical purpose valid though it was and still is overshadowed the exploratory excitement that life focus aroused, and attraction not unlike those accompany other biologically imperatives. Life focus is one of those basic functions that are so crucial to human in-- existence that people are innately driven to exercise them, whether or not they serve the basic purpose. Life focus is just as natural to our lives as eating, sex, physical movement, or any of the other biological basics that direct us. We eat because of our appetite not make us healthy yet, that's what makes us healthy. We have sex because we feel its urge, not because it replenishes the species yet, it replenishes the species. We move physically because it is natural for us to move not just because we need to get somewhere yet moving gets us there. So also, we examine the lives we are living because it is only natural to do so yet, the stories we tell illuminate our lives, energizing a momentum toward connecting with each other. I therefore proposed, a paradigm shift that would move us beyond the remediation of psychological disturbance to a larger and more public focus. The original medical purpose and insight still served well as psychological troubleshooters. However, there isn't clearly manifested public fascination these days not just for changing people but more board-- broadly for the portrayal of life. This has created a promise for everyday people who seek a spirited enlightenment to look not only to the sources of their personal troubles but to the generics of living. The understandings and procedures originally targeted for the resolution of acute problems have poured out of the office into a society with a large numbers people have become more than ever thirsty for opportunities to look at their lives forming what I would call a focused revolution. This advances psychotherapy relevance beyond medical parameters would have surprised Freud. According to Bruno Bettelheim, I was in a workshop with him one time. Freud said that psychoanalysis would never get done in the USA because Americans to his dismay insisted an improvement. 

00:26:15
[sil.] 

00:26:20
ERVING POLSTER Ah, he was obviously wrong about Americans accepting psychoanalysis but what strange put down about the American need for improvement. There is a pivotal message in his observation though, one that was bypassed not only by the American public but also ironically by Freud himself. He was after all a physician and he was commissioned to try to cure people. Yes, he had broader vision recognizing life focuses a fertile source of human enlightenment relevant for people in the work the-- in a work of their world. However, her was swept into the medical need to cure them. Now, onto the third point I wanna make, that I am proposing as a new pathway for psychotherapist and what people are already engaging in everyday. Oh, that's, that's the point I wanna make. That they want that new pathway and they are fascinated in doing it. We can see how deeply ingrain they are in paying attention to their lives by looking at three of societies favorite normal activities, ordinary everyday activities requiring very little of our professional influent. They are the, the three are religion, the arts, and everyday conversation. And I will now illustrate how these formats serve the live focus need. First, I'll look at religion. The number of religious org-- ah, religious congregations and membership is very large. According to the Hartford Institute for Religion Research there are 335,000 religious congregations in the United States alone. They also report that there are approximately 56 million weekly Christian worshipers. Other surveys report anywhere between 20 and 40% of people attend a church on the previous weekend. What draws all these people? There's much evidence that most people don't come religiv-- religious service to be-- to be changed. They do indeed seek help when in trouble but these remedial supports are tangential benefit. The more obvious attractions-- the more obvious attractions is that they like to come. They come be affirm, to be part of a community, to deepen their sense of what it is like to be alive, to be entertained, to have cosmic mysteries explained, to hear inspirational music, to follow tradition. Yes, religious leaders do often exhort people to change. Yes, behavior is institutionally regulated as in the 10 commandments. Yes, the message of salvation offers a religious parallel to the psycho-therapeutic cure or growth and healing is not uncommonly sought in religious congregations. Yes, many people's way of life has been transformed by the religious experience. However, of you ask people why they go to church or synagogue, taking their behavior or improving their relationships are not the most likely responses that pop into their minds. A Gallup poll study in 2007 reported that 562-- that of 562 adults who attended church at least monthly only 23% said they came for spiritual growth and guidance. The rest came to keep grounded, to feel inspired, to honor their faith, to worship God, to have a fellowship of other members of the community, to support their belief and religion, to follow the path re-- in which were brought up. In consonants with these findings Barna research group study of motivation says that only one-sixth of Christians say they are totally committed to engaging in personal spiritual development. While this kind of survey only scratches the surface of a complex web of reasons for church going, its results are harmonious with what people are likely to hear in ordinary conversations about going to church. It is certainly clear that for most church goers, the familiar psycho-therapeutic intention to work on the relational issues or overcome behavior or emotional limitations would be an unlikely purpose. People don't go to church to get over a post-traumatic stress disorder, of anger management or to be in freed of obsessive thinking, they don't typically evaluate their religious experience on a scale that measures personal change. What is more impor-- ah, what is more apparent is that the absorbing rituals, the music, the history, and the ethos of exceptional acceptance magnifies the experience of life period. In further manifestation of the opportunities for life focus, the Judeo-Christian storyline plays a large role in their teachings. The story of Christ is said to be the greatest story ever told. Not only is the story of Jesus compelling but also the story of Moses and the many other characters who have played a role in the history of the religions. What young person reading the Bible in not enthralled with the drama of the Exodus from Egypt, the murder of Abel by Cain, Moses has rise to leadership, Christ healing of the sick, the drama of the Last Supper, Joseph's rise to power and forgiveness of his brothers, these are events that are fascinating. Simply as literary experiences highlighting the trail victory over disaster and many other dramatic life themes. The life focus community does not have its own public heroes, or defining stories perhaps it will possibly to be taken from literature or history. Personal heroes are bound however, in the drama of individual storylines. These stories told in communal conversation give dimension to the idea of personal heroes when they give them state-- when they give them he-- when they give hero status to certain people in their own lives by celebrating their importance. An uncle, a teacher, a neighbor, an athlete, any of these maybe acknowledged more indelibly in the communal setting than in the dim periphery of the person's private mind. Okay, now, let's look at how life focus enters into the arts. It is d-- and, and you know, which goes on all the time. It is difficult to assess how many books are sold per year and how many portrayed the lives we live but a report by the New York Times will convey the large scope of this productivity. According data from the blook-- book industry study group, 3.1 billion books were sold in the USA in 2005. As mighty as this number is, it is only a hint of the public that achieves life focus through the arts. First, the figure is limited to the USA. Large as that readership is, it doesn't take into account the colossal number of people who are drawn to other art-- opportunities such as those provided by movies, museums, lectures, music, painting and educational classes in the arts. These vehicles are largely devoted to showing the people-- to showing how people live their lives, their adventures, their relationships, their pleasures, and disappointments, their most intimate ways of thinking. They are the messengers of human experience. While it is true that the content of these artful produc-- productions portrays the lives of people other than the consumer. These other people are representative people spotting implications for the lives of the consumer. The reader of a novel intuitively feels a common ground with much of the novels imagined world. Whatever the setting is as-- will be as foreign as the Gulag or the-- or as-- or the character-- whether the setting is as foreign as the Gulag or the characters far removed as a mountain climber or the theme as bizarre as a theft of museum painting. The events fit into the imagination of the reader. However, the experience of the arts is so common that its personal relevance may go unnoticed. People are so absorbed in the pleasure of the stories they read or the music they hear, or the paintings they see that they will often not recognize the experiences as having anything to do with their own actual lives. You know that's true for most of us. Nevertheless, the characters and circumstances represent scenarios that are either approximated in their own lives, or that accentuate special aspects of the world they live in. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye for example awakened the generation to the trouble-- the tribulations of trying to live a life of directed-- directness and honesty. So as Solzhenitsyn described the horrors of the Gulag, and its implications about living under tyranny. Moby-Dick taught us about struggle and grudge, and grandiosity, cockpit, the misty in accessibility of the real world we all live in. With the (inaudible ) precedent the life focus community prioritizes the portrayal of life. Portrayal of life experience over the changing of people's lives. That's not to say that people don't change their lives, ah, we can maybe discuss that in the discussion about how change intercepted this scenario. For the novelist, the priority portrayal is so clear that is-- that it hardly needs to be stated not so for the psychotherapist, for whom it is almost heretical to step away from solving problems. What I'm proposing is that the portrayal of lives is itself a humanly compelling process while the stories people tell each other in the life focus community don't reach the quality of artistic portrayal, they don't have to. It may seem like the high quality of portrayals of the artist is what draws people more so that it would be true amongst stories, ordinary folks tell each other. However, ordinary folks have an important advantage or the artist. The intimacy of immediate and life connection often tramps talent in transmitting a message. Indeed, the life focus community gives each person a direct sense of idiomatic relevance by spelling out the themes that have marked their own lives, telling each other how these have played out in their own lives. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, look at life focus in everyday conversation. Paying attention how we live our lives is apparent not only among speakers, amo-- among seekers of enlightenment. We see it in ordinary conversation when people talk to each other about what is going on in their lives and how they feel about it. I will illustrate the story-- I will illustrate this by telling a story about an informal of conversation at a restaurant. A group of my friends, none of whom is a psychologist, there are sets of people, ah, we recurrently go out to dinner just an ordinary evening out joining together for a sociable talk. On this particular evening, one of the men ask the rest of the men of us whether, whether we have directed our lives, or whether the things we did just happened spontaneously. What a fundamental question. And it hit the mark for all of us. We talk all night about it that I'll give only a couple of examples of what were said. One of the men didn't feel like he directed his life at all. He just turned in to a-- tuned in to events as they happen and he told us one example of that, how long ago, after some years as a successful engineering consultant, he was fired from his job. He-- he was dismayed about that, pretty soon packed himself up and started his own company. He has made it a thriving enterprise never having anticipated starting a business of his own. It was just something he did to solve the, ah, an anticipated problem. The second man told a quite different story, telling us how he had consciously stirred his life. He had been highly successful position but that was not enough for him. He wanted time. For him, time was the greatest commodity in life. Not leaving this wish to fantasy land, he targeted himself toward an early retirement. He fastened his mind to this clear purpose to retire earlier than anyone else in his position might have imagined. In spite of already having created an excellent career in the promise that it would continue, he retired in his 40s, now in his 70s, he has never missed his work and more importantly he has created exciting projects. He told us about some of them. Creating his own sculptures, building a pond and, bridges on a property own, reading copiously, pay-- playing an active in a-- ongoing relationship with family friends and traveling to places he might otherwise have been unable to visit. Always mightily absorbed, he was aware that in all those years after retiring he has not had a boring day. Each of the others also told how directness play-- was played out in their lives. Each story enigmatic and interesting. Time flew and though we came to the restaurant early, we were the last to leave just short of being tossed out a closing time. While we were there, only for the pleasure of our company, we-- without prior intent lit up some aspects of life, not only for our specific lives but also about life itself. Accentuating what otherwise would pass through our minds more fleeting leave than the experiences desert. Lest we wondered whether the interest in this self-exploration depends on the exceptionality of these particular men. I think it is readily evident that the attraction of stories crosses the lines of personality, talent, education or purpose, widely interesting for both the teller and the listener. People commonly tell each other about the horrors they experience in moving from one house to another. They tell about the high points of visiting another country. They tell about the strange feeling of talking to the lawyer, handling their divorces. At last however, unless they give enhance fo-- unless given, enhanced focus to their experience, casual story telling lacks the strong personal registration that key personal themes deserve. There are of course many ways the individual-- for individual people to make up for this slippage. They get together with friends for vacation, lunches, dinner parties, they celebrate people de-- dear to them, they meditate at free time to let their minds roam, they read and discuss what they have read, they reduce daily responsibilities. However, these experiences are episodic from many and it is commonplace for people to feel that life is passing them by. Special hospitality for life to finding story telling is a key ingredient of life focus communities which I'll show detail later in this conference. That's not advertisement it's just an drop out from talking now of, ah,-- what is important to say here, is that these groups provide an assurance of continuity. Meeting extensively, perhaps for a lifetime. They serve as a breeding ground for themes that ravel around in people's minds, lying fellow but then arouse-- our right for elaboration, interpersonal stories. The meetings provide a place like none other in everyday life set apart from the daily movement from moment to moment. The setting is reserved for life focus, for a release from the external pressure freed to pay attention to personal experiences that are often elude awareness. They enter people into a guided tour of the mind, mapped out with exercises that impel members to discover their own simple voices, as they scroll their lives to unfold stories, heard in an atmosphere of amplification and mutuality. In this setting, people will create an unusual combination of respite and stimulation, a place where demands are reduced that the menu of idea is in-- activities will nevertheless be invigorated. What specially-- what is especially important and easily overlooked in our individually minded society is the responsivity of a community of people. The contribution unmatched in private exploration. Beyond the specific conversational exchanges the group experience provides a readers commentary, music plate, poets reread, a convergence of diverse minds on universal themes. Contagious atmosphere of people affirming life-- their life experience and especially the assured continuity of meeting. All of these conditions merged to offer a rare form of hospitality to every person's mind enabling them more fruitfully to navigate the broad parameters of their existence. To recognize such a promisee of the portrayal can be a mighty boost in the creation of the life focus communities. These people come together not so much to address what is wrong with them as to explore what their lives are about. T he premise of such community friendly formats is therefore grounded in the widespread need for people to register their life experience rather than on the groups pressure for improvement. Accordingly, the groups would be tailored for that large segment of the population who seek clarification, drama, affirmation, and belonging in the lives they are already living.

CAMILLO LORIEDO Thank you. Dr. Erving for-- his wonderful presentation. Now, we have the counterpart from Jean Houston. 

00:49:00
JEAN HOUSTON Thank you. Well, I, I don't see it is counterpart. I see it as a co-point. This was a magnificent at luminous talk is what in it. Just wonderful, thank you. You know, Erving as I was listening to you, I was reminded of a time, oh, it was quite some time ago. This is November 1978. And I was present at the death Margaret Mead. Actually, what happened was a day before her dying. And she suddenly sat in bed in the hospital and she looked over at the corner and she said, "Get out of here! Go! Scram! Get out of there!" I said, "Uhm, Margaret, there's nobody there." "Oh, they are there you just can't see them." And I said, "Well, whose there?" She said, "My mother, my father and Ruth." Ruth was her most beloved friend, Ruth Benedict. And then she lay back and she said, "Look, I've been lying here being an anthropologist on my own dying, fascinating experience. There's no higher ranking to it. And I want to tell you to forget everything I've been teaching you over the last six year about working with governments and bureaucracies." I said, "Now, you tell me this now." As she says, "I see if we're going to, hah, grow and green our time. It's a question of people getting together and teaching learning communities." That was her words, teaching learning communities. Well, what would they do? Well, they would sit around and they would talk about their lives. And they would-- levels of experience and understanding and sharing would activate the deep wisdom of their lives. Well, what else would they do Margaret? "Well, they would do exercises. They would do exercises and human growth, the kind of thing as you do Jean, other people do. And there would be good food. Hmm, no psychotherapist." She was very clear about that because she said, "Cuz then you get this-- you get the psychic carnivore who takes over, just talks about themself." But they would grow together both in sharing the depth in witnessing of their lives and also doing exercises to prime their minds, their bodies, their spirits. And then she said, "And then, they would go out, and they would know what together they could do in their community. And they would make a difference. And the world would shift." And hearing your beautiful paper, it reminded me so much of Margaret's last perception and the nature of reality, cuz essentially she was also being a kind of, ah, prototypical of the life-- focused types of community about which I have a lot of questions for you. But let me also say that, hmm, the landscape of living-- I mean, what a gorgeous turn isn't? Landscape of living, the way it opens up the valleys, the hills, the mountains, the low parts, the high parts the, the sheer, a fulgent, richness of what we recall the geo-psychic realm. It is both the realm without and the realm within. I think of Rumi who said that for every garden outside, there are a thousand gardens within. And how do we share those gardens? And there goes Rumi and his mystical state began to have an state of finding the beloved became this genius of the outpouring of the richness of that reality. By the way, have of you ever heard Rumi and the original version cuz it's very different. (inaudible ). It was the kind of sound that really sounded in your, your bones. Your bones became flutes for his words. But one of the things that I have as a question for you, ah, Erving is that living in a time of so much change and so much challenge where many of us live five to 10 to even a 100 times the amount of sheer experience compared to our ancestors of let's say even a 100 years ago. There's both so much to talk about and we have gotten into a pathology of, ah, avoiding this kind of talk because we have too much to do. Technology if anything has given us to much to do. I mean, I won't ask you how many of you go to your emails in the morning as the first thing. We will not embarrass you with that question. But in the sense we're also at the end of history as we have known it. And we're not yet at the beginning of the new his story, okay or her story as the case maybe. We are the people of the parenthesis between the end of one era and not quite the beginning of the new one. And I find that the future is, ah, whatever is trying to merge is ceded and coded in times of parenthesis. And this is where I find that your focus-- the focus groups, the life focus groups have so much to offer because unless we harvest the genius, the richness of our lives and of the past, and of what we assume and it's profoundly know, then we will really not have much of a future at all. So I think what you are talking about, I'm looking forward to your book so much, is how to-- and I presume it's part of what your plan to orchestrate the sharing so that the richness of the lives can be gleaned. And it is this richness of this wisdom, is wisdom sharing, this wisdom harvesting, this deepening of the understanding, the human edition can go forward and activate the next stages of our lives. So yes, the therapist traditionally helps cure, helps change but does not necessarily sit in wonder and astonishment before the portrayal of the life that classical awful 50-minute hour. I have had much experience sitting around with native Americans. And all we do is share and nobody gets to the point of the change that we're looking at, how to get rid of the casino of finding whatever the question is. But it is really about just telling stories, and that's why I have to say that so often of what other things, oh, indigenous people, oh, poverty struck this in one way, but enormously rich in other ways. Because we sit around and those just saying-- I'm just saying I've been you know, I've been allowed to be in these, these circles whether I'm in the (inaudible ) with the Maoris or in various-- I've been actually been an igloos of the far North. But sitting and in the deep sharing of funny stories, ideas. Do you remember when Winnipeg-- remember when he lost the fish, ha-ha-ha and went after and everybody is laughing because it's also a collective knowing and it has advanced the enrichment of the community. Now, in a time when we maybe on the verge of moving to a global comments, a global comments. What I'm referring to is a planetary civilization with not just high individuation of culture. But with focus on people to people. Something else is trying to happen. Something else is trying to happen beneath the surface crest of the two muchness of crisis. And that is what I'm looking for, and that certainly what I think that you're speaking about because people are getting together. You're quite right, women's groups everywhere. We've been circles, gathering the women. Men's groups, ah, church groups, people needing and this is part of the evolutionary movement of the rise of consciousness. People meaning-- needing to deeply face each other and to speak and to grow and to do. And from that comes, ah, I believe the, the enunciation of the prophetic moment. And the givingness from the depths of our collective together experience of what we truly need to do next. Last week, I was for eight days in Ecuador, invited by the government of Ecuador to help them activate something they're calling Buen Vivir or plentiful living. And it wasn't necessarily about money or oil, or anything like was quite the difference. How do we at every stage in health and education, in community, be-- community was the big issue. How do we activate plentiful living? So I said interestingly, you know, "Well, instead of saying one, two, three, four and didactically look for solutions, why don't we just surround and talk this and wonder, bravo-- wonderful." And that's what we did. We did not do what I'm sometimes called to do for the UN with other things to just sit down and look for solutions. We lived in presence of each other and all these stories. And I have translator all the time cuz my Spanish is not very good. And out of that came the mystery of cultural deepening and total growth, because what we were looking for was Buen Vivir, the beauty and the goodness of living. Can you imagine what would happen in the White House if we could do something, well, never mind that's not gonna happen anytime soon. But, but-- so I think, ah, what we are in is a time of the revivification of inner space, certainly I who was you know, had something to do with the human potentials movement. Finding space for inner space, and inner space doesn't mean, they're just your meditating of thing-- inner space means that you allow for a community in which the depths of who and what we are can be told, can be portrayed in the simplest ways. Christ speaks in parables. What's simpler? Those parables become ceded, coded, uhm, or should I say, like crystals dropped into a supersaturated solution and growing. And that's what I see happening in this focus-- life focus groups. From this kind of growth comes the basis truly of whatever is trying to emerge. It allows us to have the, ah, the soil, the sun, the soil, the wind that activates the growth. It becomes the spring time. I mean, the poet says, "the human heart can go to the lengths of God," and I think that's what happens in this. And then says, "dark and cold we maybe, but this is no winter now. The frozen misery of centuries breaks, cracks, begins to move," that's what's happening now. "The thunder is the thunder of the flood, the flow, the upstart spring." And then he says, "Thank God our time is now when wrong comes up to meet us everywhere, n ever to leave us till we take the longest stride of soul folk ever took. Affairs are now soul sized. The enterprise is exploration into God." Then he say, "What are you making for? It takes so many thousand years to wake, but will you wake for pity's sake!" I truly believe of what you are proposing in these focused groups are mansions of a wakefulness, are tippies of discovery, or igloos, or atriums arena in which people truly cannot only harvest the genius and the greatness and the beauty and the depth, and the compassion of human experience but it can also cross all the great divides of utterness and come together in a new symbiosis in which society can grow. And so my questions to you my friend, is can you the-- talk about what you would be doing in these focus groups? What would be the design, the strategy, the actual happenings of how they look up? 

01:03:20
[sil.] 

01:03:25
ERVING POLSTER Well, there would be many different possible designs but I... 

01:03:30
JEAN HOUSTON Would you like to use this, this is... 

01:03:35
ERVING POLSTER There, there were many possible designs and there are many ways that people are already doing this. The, ah, the fundamental principle is that, ah, the group come together to be able to have a special kind of attention that you can't have in everyday life, in the sense, in the sense, the, ah, the processes is heir to the religions. Somehow another Freud in his great antipathy to religion did not see himself as being that kind of an heir, he saw himself as I supposed you'd have say, hoping to wipe put religion. He didn't do anything supported toward it and from a good reasons I'm not, I'm not objecting to his point of view about the religions he was describing and the things were saying about them. But was true was that he was offering an alternative. Now, that alternative in religion has its details of how you proceed, ours are not that easily arranged at this point because we started out working with only individuals and with small groups, there's not a lot of precedent. But what I see in terms of a basic design is that people come together on a, on a regular basis. And each meeting has a theme, it might be repeated themes, it might be favorite themes for certain groups. Ah, it would be designed by the community. There might be some carry over from one to another as historically people learned from each other and begin to get some common ground of what they're gonna be doing. But, so for example, I mentioned the, ah, group in which a home wou-- the to-- home was the theme. But what happened in that group is that I've started out with something I had written about, ah, what I called prime of familiarity as a starting point for the group. Then we had, ah, small demonstration group that talked about what that evoked in them, about home. They talk to each other. Then I played a song which was about, ah, a woman who had returned to Tanzania where she grew up because her parents were missionaries and she was-- she's singing a beautiful song but inspiriting song. That something that psychotherapist generally do not incorporate into their work. They don't incorporate the stimulations that are available for reaching into the heart of what people feel. They depend more on the, uhm, developmental conversation than they do on any kind of, uhm, uhm, common effect. So but these groups would have a common effects-- you have the concept at home which we have the concept of belonging. You could have the concept of competition. You could have the concept of, ah, ah, what it's like when you've said something you-- you wish you hadn't said. It could be anyone of a number of different themes where people-- we, we have some stimulation in a plenary group. Now, for example, what Jean is doing now and talking to you, to me it feels very stimulating. After hearing your talk I would be moved to do things with each other that I might not be moved if I were simply in a-- ordinary conversational situation. So the group would have that stimulating effect of arousing people to care about the particular themes that were being presented. Then the plenary gr-- plenary group would break in to groups of three or four so that in these groups people would each have a chance to put the-- their stories. It wouldn't be just a communal event where you get a communal story. Each person would have as idiomatic story told to each other and then report back to the group what they-- happened in the small groups. So you get a sense of, of, ah, the interrelationship between this individual kinds of storyline, and what happens in-- all group by the time you're done, you have a some level of amplification of the theme and what it would mean in your life. Now, if that happens regularly, it has a very different place in your life than if it happens sporadically. Ah, and, and, and for most of us it happens is quite occasionally, I think most people in psychotherapy be certain as belong in one group or another, at one time or another. 

01:08:25
JEAN HOUSTON Ah, shall we have some questions. Yeah, let's have some questions. I think it will be lovely, in such a rich givingness that he has offered so many ideas. Yes. 

01:08:40
 Hello, ah, I would like to know cuz, uhm, Dr. Polster, uhm... 

01:08:40
JEAN HOUSTON You have to speak louder - 

01:08:45
 Oh, I'm sorry. 

01:08:45
JEAN HOUSTON - and slower and clearer. 

01:08:45
 Dr. Polster I'm a little bit confused about, about what you're saying because and perhaps Jean, you as well. Uhm, what-- what is the role that pain plays in all of this? Is it-- I mean, is, is there a way that pain is what brings people to these types of groups? Pain or suffering because the, the option of living in a, in a different way is no longer acceptable to them, uhm... 

01:09:15
ERVING POLSTER Are you asking what role of pain, pain plays in all this? 

01:09:20
 Yes, pain and, uhm... 

01:09:20
ERVING POLSTER Yeah, well, pain plays, ah, human role and that's how people experience pain and that would be part of what would be the, the content of the storyline of particular people. Ah, this woman that I quoted in this paper, she had a pain about going back home. And she was in some distress about and spoke about it. Now, ah, a, a correlation of a, a-- a correlative question is what do you do about pain in terms of solving it? And that brings psychotherapy into the picture and that's very, ah, uncertain boundary between how you deal with portraying life and how you deal with changing lives that call for change. But of course I'm not discounting the importance of psychotherapy. Ah, in no way is this-- ah, in any, ah, diminution of the importance of psychotherapy, what I'm saying is that what is been the product of psychotherapy which is the diminution of pain from any people, improvement of lives for many people, ah, is a process which applies to the public at large rather than only those who are suffering in acute problem. So if somebody is, is suffering in acute problem perhaps it could be dissolved in this benevolence situation but it would not be an therapeutic situation in the sense that a private therapy would be. So there might be some conversations with the person set up in different groups, could have different designs or it might referral system for people who need something beyond what is happening in the group. Those are, ah, things that have to be taken into account. I don't have a, ah, an answer to just how that would, ah, proceed. 

01:11:25
JEAN HOUSTON It seems to me that since these are issues that would come up during the focus, life focus groups, pain always would come up cuz it just does. Ah, what if one of the design strategies things-- do as-- instead of dealing with it, the way the therapist would, people would say, if I had not suffered, I would not be able to and then you feel, ah, to have compassion for others, to really reach out to many people, to understand another person's heart. But I, I'm just-- see I'm looking for what are also some of the strategic designs that would differ from the therapeutic situation. 

01:12:10
ERVING POLSTER Well, there would natural benevolent effect I believe and people having a common mind of having a, ah, ah, dependable place to be, of, ah, people listening and, uhm, joining in with what their experiences are, sense of belonging. All of that would be inherent to the process even though it wouldn't-- it wouldn't have therapy as its primary function. 

01:12:40
 So, so I guess my question then, thank you for answering that for, for both of you, is how is-- how does this differ from a, a self-help group? 

01:12:50
ERVING POLSTER Did you hear? 

01:12:55
JEAN HOUSTON How would this differ from a self-help group? 

01:12:55
ERVING POLSTER Oh, well the, ah, it wouldn't be a self-help group in a sense that, ah, there would be leadership and design. These groups would, ah, that I'm talking about it wouldn't have to have a prior design but my-- my proposal was designed that the groups be, ah, carried out in a way that, ah, everybody knows what the theme is in the same page in terms of what, what the, ah, ah, target focuses even though it would expressed idiomatically. And of the benefits of this kind of situation is that you have a generalized theme which have individualized expression. Yeah. 

01:13:40
 Uhm, my question is about, ah, a religion, ah, religious groups because the religion has, ah, other alienating component, uhm, trainee-- ah, molding people, uhm, but, but you-- certain types and, uhm, also, uhm, teaching people obedience. So, ah, my co-- my concept of, uhm, communal groups that, that you propose, ah, that, uhm, that is similar to what you propose is much closer to pathetic from set in, ah, the same society 1955. But, uhm, this dual, ah, roles of religious, ah, institutions is really something that I can't see how it would well function in this, ah, life communities. 

01:14:30
ERVING POLSTER Well, if I understand your question, and my hearing is diminished. If I understand your question, you're wondering how you can combine the dual roles of, ah, taking into account that people have troubles, it must be addressed and portraying lives which doesn't really have the acute problem as a mean-- as main focus. Is that your question? 

01:14:55
 Ah, it was, it was also about that I'll-- you said that religious groups are, uhm, ah, where this life, uhm, focus communities can function well. I'm not sure about that. I have, I have, ah, really different view of religion, or organized religion. 

01:15:15
ERVING POLSTER Well, as I say, I, I'm not, I'm not quite getting what you're asking. 

01:15:20
JEAN HOUSTON He's asking about formalized religion - 

01:15:25
ERVING POLSTER Well... 

01:15:25
JEAN HOUSTON - and how it could these religions-- could be spoke as groups operate within a formalized religious groups... 

01:15:35
ERVING POLSTER Oh, oh... 

01:15:35
JEAN HOUSTON So patterned among certain belief systems. 

01:15:35
ERVING POLSTER Well, it, ah, in, uhm, if, ah, I think that, uhm, religious groups are already incorporating some aspects of this in their relational groups. In fact there are many-- there are number churches, perhaps many where the relational groups are more important than the worship format. And they are discovering that, that relationship matters and they seem to be handling it very well. And I do, ah, ah, have some, ah, reports of groups like that, ah, that are-- there's some large church organizations that are incorporating these relational groups in very powerful ways. Ah, so it-- there-- they're, they're handling that, okay. What I take from your question is another problematic issue, and that is the issue of how do we separate our history of dealing with acute problems. And re-- and, and feeling like we have to do that which will not violate anybody's addressing of their acute problems and how do you do that in a group, or you don't know who the indivi-- what the individuals acute problem is. Well, religion of course will done that permanently. Ah, but, ah, we, we don't in-- we don't intend to ignore that people have individual problems which are not going to be address by this group situation that require special attention. It's not a matter of damning the psychotherapy process, it's a matter of expanding it to include groups where that is not the primary purpose. And but which does have very important social purpose. Ah, if we think ourselves as the heirs to religion, that's a very large idea. The idea that will somehow-- we could have more than role in solving acute problems will that rather give people a, a some procedures for handling the complexities of life in a, in a, uhm, ah, in a sanctified situation. What I mean by sanctified is a situation that is set apart from the, from the, ah, everyday world. The everyday world where these problems cannot be addressed because they don't-- they interfere with the productivity process or the simple momentum process. So we need something to get off that conveyor belt and deal with what-- one would think of as a spiritual type of thing. I don't use the word spiritual very much because I'm not really sure what it's referring to, and very often, it, ah, it, it-- it's used in a, in a quasi supernatural way which is not the way I think. But I do think in terms of this spirit of being, the spirit of a person of how, how one feels, and, ah, wants and, ah, how that can be incorporated into a world in which that is relatively unimportant in certain momentum created situations. We need a respite from that. Religion provides it. We don't-- ah, we do. In fact, I must say, one of Freud's greatest inventions overlooked as it-- as a great invention, he invented a new commu-- a new society in his office, with new rules you forget about that society out there. When you come into this office, you forget about the, the admonitions out there. We are free beings here. We-- we're gonna make our situation here we the two of us make it. Well, that is just simply, ah, ah, a very important concept and it's not surprising that one would wanna expand that into the community of ours. 

01:19:30
JEAN HOUSTON I'm thinking about Dr. Peter Mayer. Ah, Dr. Peter Mayer was Freud's was Freud's antiquity dealer. When I was 12 years old, I used to go by his shop cuz I'd look at antiquities and I fell in love with this magnificent Demeter and Persephone but alas in those days, it was big piece, it cost $200 and I didn't have it. And then it was gone, and he invited me and he says, "I think maybe this time you should lead-- live, learn about antiquities." So he thought me how to, ah, recognize them and how, ah, you know, do medicine, a lot of them etcetera. And he would give me, he would let me hold an Aphrodite. He said, "Dr. Freud always saw these antiquities as having complexes. Jean, you must promise never to do that. You have to understand it from the time it comes." I said, "I'll try Dr. Pater Mayer." And I think that you know, the-- well, this is where we're in France where the, the beliefs of hundreds and thousands of years ago are still rife in our time. Now, do we just, just say away with them? Forget, rip it. We've turn the page, ah, no it's almost impossible. It is part of our, our metaphysical, our psychological DNA. The issue is how to make these forms, should you want to do that like yeast and the rising dough of an emerging consciousness and an emerging civilization. So it isn't-- I mean, look what's happening in the Roman Catholic church for god sakes. You know, where you had the previous pope and I won't say anything about him. But you've got this very interesting new guy who is willing to face and have community around him all the time to really talk deeply about the problems calls the carrier, the leprosy of the Catholic church. I mean things are happening all over in terms of systemic transformation of which I really believe, I think that these landscape of the psyche is focus groups can do so much to accelerate whatever is the new emerging seeking of spirit. 

01:21:50
ERVING POLSTER You know, when I, when I used to do the-- a very long time ago when I was working with somebody and, uhm, I didn't have much connection with religious pra-- practice of procedure then. But, ah, someone is in trouble and I'm doing the best I can therapy and they tell me that, ah, they belong to this church. And about how they're going there. I remember feeling so glad that they had that opportunity. So glad that some place besides my therapy office was can be a communal opportunity for them to be welcome, to be, ah, act-- to be accepted, to be guided. Ah, I didn't-- I, I was not in consonants with some of the actual principles but I still felt I was in I-- and I think to myself, why didn't I have that option within my field? Why am I, why am I shipping it out to religion? Why don't we have a guiding frame of mind that would help people in their everyday lives rather than just wanna have an acute problem? 

01:23:10
JEAN HOUSTON We have another question. 

01:23:10
 Perhaps I should carry out my question by saying that I am a recovering behaviorist. Uhm I... 

01:23:20
JEAN HOUSTON He's a recovering behaviorist. 

01:23:20
 And the question is that more than a hundred years ago, uhm, psychology run away from philosophy like it's a demon. And now, at this particular moment that you have coalesce around all the ideas that has existed all the time and philosophy tried to reckon with them. What tools do we have now to make this journey? Are you suggesting that there is, uhm, in your school of thought, ah, is it a philosophical, uhm, road that we are taking, or is it just a spiritual? Thank you for taking my question. 

01:24:00
ERVING POLSTER What proof do we have of what? 

01:24:05
 No. I ask if-- is there a philosophical road that we are taking or is that purely spiritual, or is it scientific? So... 

01:24:10
ERVING POLSTER Can you hear... 

01:24:10
JEAN HOUSTON He's asking about the different roads that, ah, to, to take the scientific, the philosophical or the spiritual cuz my answer is that it's all happening simultaneously and in an incredible interweaving this, that's what I see. It's not like it's parallel paths as it used to happen in the past. 

01:24:40
ERVING POLSTER Yeah, is there another question? 

01:24:45
JEAN HOUSTON Does not the question-- there's answer to that question. 

01:24:45
ERVING POLSTER Oh, no. Oh, ah, okay. No I, no I-- the, the, ah, the interweaving is, uhm, is, is pretty important. I mean, ah, obviously, ah, but we have-- we, uhm, we design certain areas of function that take care of certain problems and we don't take care of everything. So nobody can take care of everything. So what I'm talking about now is taking care of some of the needs people have to process their own minds and their own-- what's going on in their lives, ah, in, in a setting that is hospitable to doing that. Now, will that take care of everything? Of course not. Ah, it, it certainly related to psychotherapy as it's practiced now. And it certainly friendly to that practice. It, it, it borrows everything from it, but it's an expansion beyond the prod-- the, ah, the medical-- the medical orientation. You know, many of us even though we say we've gotten past the medical, uhm, the, the medical, ah format but as long as we were working in the office, we're not. There's still that element of you come here with an acute problem, I'm gonna try to-- we don't say cure you anymore because we don't think of it. We, we now recognize the people coming to therapy when it come for-- a while and then not come and then come back again later on. So we don't talk about cure but we do-- we do think about acute problems and solving them in a limited period of time and then you're off on your own. 

01:26:45
JEAN HOUSTON One last question. 

01:26:45
 Hello, ah, as I was listening I was thinking that perhaps another kind of life force group could be a book club. My book club gets into very profound issues we've been meeting for almost 10 years. Ah, some people have gone and-- but mostly were pretty stable. We have a leader usually, the person who selected the book and while we do talk about literary kinds of things. We also talk about spiritual kinds of things - 

01:27:15
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

01:27:15
 - a psychological kinds of things cuz most of us are in the field. And when I leave, I always feel elevated. I feel like I have communicated, contributed, shared and I've also received a lot. So... 

01:27:35
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

01:27:35
 I, I was thinking if you think a book club could be a kind of life force ro... 

01:27:40
ERVING POLSTER Well, absolute-- absolutely I did mention book clubs are part of it. There are also men's groups and women's groups but book clubs are, ah, they were all over the place and much of the attraction is that you're gonna deal with common life issues. It's true that they, ah, come also because it's entertainment and, ah, ah, the-- they like discussing them. But we-- I, I don't exclude entertainment from this process of, ah, of, uhm, ah, tapping into our minds. 

01:28:15
JEAN HOUSTON Ah, Erving the conclusion. Ah, you have-- you're going to be giving a seminar. Are you gonna be giving seminar in some of the... 

01:28:25
ERVING POLSTER Workshop. 

01:28:25
JEAN HOUSTON Workshop, when is that? 

01:28:25
ERVING POLSTER I think it's on Sunday. 

01:28:25
JEAN HOUSTON On Sunday you're giving a workshop. So please look for that and I'm giving one this afternoon from 2:30 on the Wizard of Oz the. Well, thank you everybody. It's been wonderful and it's been a lot of fun being with you. Thank you. 

01:28:40
