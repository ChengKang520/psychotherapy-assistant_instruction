Introduction by Marie L. Miville, Ph.D. Winter Roundtable Director Teacher College, Columbia University New York, NY 

00:00:00
MARIE L. MIVILLE, PH.D. And so, now I'd like to introduce our plenary panel. These are individuals who have had tremendous impact and without whom, again, we wouldn't be here today. First, among firsts, is Joseph L. White, the godfather of black psychology, the pioneer who's article Ebony Magazine 40 years, over 40 years ago, revolutionized our field and led to much of the work that we do today in social justice. It's just hard to imagine where we would be in psychology without Dr. White. 

00:01:30
[applause] 

00:01:30
MARIE L. MIVILLE, PH.D. And Joe was actually one of our very first Helms Mentoring award winners. So, he's been with the roundtable a very long time. Beverly Greene, whose work has been pioneering regarding the inner sections of our identities and the impact that race, gender and sexual orientation have on our functioning. Just a simple fact, 10 of her 30 awards have recognized the impact her publications have had in our field, and particularly, the integration of professional practice and social justice. 

00:02:05
[applause] 

00:02:05
MARIE L. MIVILLE, PH.D. Connie Chan, also one of the first psychologists every to write on intersectionality, particularly as this effects Asian-Americans and women, and she continues her work today as a trustee of the American Psychological Foundation, which means she's well-connected to funding sources, yay, which provide important financial support to people in psychology at all levels of the pipeline. Uh, Dr. Heather Bullock, whose work has helped to highlight the psychological consequences of economy injustice, particularly the unique concerns of people living in poverty. And David Bluestein who is actually an alumnus of our counseling psychology program. He's a survivor and he's here now up on our stage. Dr. Bluestein's work highlights social justice issues as in terms of how they affect work and career, and the impact of social justice multicultural variables with that, especially things like underemployment, perceived barriers, and emancipatory approaches to work. Okay, and then finally, our facilitator, Dr. Angela Ferguson, a dear friend and colleague. We actually both attended our very first roundtable together at the same time. We didn't know each other, we went to the same school but actually met right here at the roundtable and have since become lifelong friends. And she is the professor and director of graduate studies at, uh, Howard University, and actually the co-editor of our new book just out this week, and I'm gonna put a plug in for it, Handbook of Race, Ethnicity and Gender in Psychology. So, our, our panel session this morning's fairly informal, and it's really more focused on personal reflections about each of our panelists' professional journeys. So, I'd like to turn this over, now, to Dr. Ferguson. 

00:04:00
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Well, good morning, and I am honored and pleased to be the facilitator of such an esteemed group, certainly I have known some of you throughout my career and my training, actually, and I most recently met a couple of others, which I am happy to meet and happy to have this discussion with. And so, I think what I'll do is start with a question that all of you are very familiar with, obviously you, uh, have dedicated your work to social justice and so, I thought I'd begin by asking you what does social justice mean to you?Anyone can go, I won't call on someone. 

00:04:35
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. Well, since I'm the oldest one, I'll speak first. 

00:04:40
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Okay, sounds good, sounds good. 

00:04:40
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. And all you setting out there are going to have the opportunity to speak too, so I don't want you running out the door talking about we're going to cover this and cover that. You're going to get your opportunity. This is gonna be a dialogue, you understand that? Alright. And I just bought a DVD yesterday on social justice, but I didn't have a machine to play it on, so I was gonna learn about it. But anyway, uh, since I'm up here now, I've got to go from what I know. So, uh, what social justice means to me is very clear and simple, it means opening up the access routes, opening up the access routes to opportunity here in America. And by the access routes to opportunity, usually there are four of five. Obviously education is one access route. Number two is probably workforce training, number three is adequate healthcare, and number four is affordable housing. So, those are the four. Education, workforce training, uh, affordable housing and healthcare. And what happens in underserved communities, is many times the access route are sealed off, that educational system doesn't work, the job training system doesn't work, healthcare system doesn't work, there isn't much in the way of affordable adequate housing. So, those of you working in social justice have to do two things, you have to revitalize the opportunity structures and the second thing you need to do is equip the people with the skills they need to access the opportunity structures. So, you've got to work on both ends. So, that's a two minute introduction, usually I lecture for 49 and a half minutes, but I don't want to take up these people's time because then they'll get mad at me, right? So that's my, so you ask me, you see me coming, I say open up the access routes. 

00:06:45
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Thank you, Joe. 

00:06:45
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. She's a former student of mine, too, so she's gonna give me an A minus. 

00:06:50
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Okay. What do I need to do to get that A plus? 

00:07:00
CONNIE S. CHAN, PH.D. Well, I'll say that I think you have to be careful when you use the term social justice because it's a term that makes a lot of people, oops, I'll hold this. I know a lot of people who say we're all for diversity, there's no proven that's gonna say we're not for social justice. Everybody's for social justice, but what exactly does that mean? So, I think, I urge you to be careful and think about, um, when we're saying we're for social justice and we're for, and I believe we're for access, to me it means we prefer equality, we prefer fairness. So, when you think about justice, it's what's just and what's right. And sometimes what's just and what's right is not easy, and for us to include and for us to, um, say no one's free unless we're all free, it makes you take some hard looks. So, I think you've got to question when you go to a program, when you go to an internship or you go to a clinic and they say, you know, our key is social justice. Say, what does that mean? Who is it for, and is it for everybody? Is it for transgender, you know, for LGBT, or what does that mean for being for transgender, what does that really mean, how do you say it? 

00:08:10
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Thank you. 

00:08:10
HEATHER E. BULLOCK, PH.D. I think I would just add to that, to think about shared power and shared resources, um, and so for me, when I think about social justice, I really think about full participation and access and that would be political, economic, social, um, the distribution of resources in a just and fair way, uh, and access to opportunity in its many forms, freedom from discrimination and equal opportunity, and also, um, institutions that not just support opportunity but also protect against unfair advantage. 

00:08:55
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Okay, thank you. 

00:08:55
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. I guess I might just add that I think a lot of what has been said flows from the assumption that all human beings are of value. And that there are no people who are expendable, whom it's alright to discard or to harm. 

00:09:10
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN, PH.D. Well, it's hard for me to build anything unique onto what my colleagues have said here, they really covered, I think the waterfront beautifully. Um, I'll just kind of take a subtext of that question and, um, one of the things that I've observed over the years is that social justice programs which started out in the 90s, 80s and 90s were not that common in counseling psychology, and now it seems like everybody says they're a social justice program. I think people need to understand what the assumptions are of what they mean by that, and I think there are political assumptions of a social justice program. If people are in fact, adhering to progressive, I mean, there are clearly progressive values here. I guess my point here is that a social justice view would be one that, that is not value neutral, that we are affirming that everybody counts, nobody's expendable, and, uh, in order for there to be a just society, people have to make sacrifices as well. Um, and I think that's really critical. So, I think the other piece about social justice is the fact that it's an ideology as well as action taking. There's efficacy and action involved and it also does transform the way you do psychotherapy and counseling. 

00:10:30
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Thank you, because that is a great segway to something that I think each of you touched on. Um, and that is obviously you were an early career psychologist and trainee, as many of our audience members are. And your work has been enduring, it, you are pioneers in your own areas and your own discipline. How do you think students or trainees can begin to incorporate this idea, whether it's the action piece of it, the research piece of it, the therapeutic pieces of it, uh, into their work? 

00:11:10
[sil.] 

00:11:10
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. I think they need to get a sample of experience, either as therapists, as community psychologists, as community action people, that in the university, we're heavy on the theoretical preparation. We can give people books and read them, videos and so on, but I think students need to get out into the field or in the counseling room and actually do it and learn to do by doing and then we can mentor them in that learning process. But I think they have to move from the theoretical to the applied at some stage of their evolution. 

00:11:50
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Okay. 

00:11:50
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. That's known as talking the talk and walking the walk. 

00:12:00
[sil.] 

00:12:00
CONNIE S. CHAN, PH.D. I think if your training (inaudible ), I think you have to think about who's missing, what's missing. Um, you know, when you, when I was a graduate student, we had a lot of theories presented to us, you know, these are developmental tasks and these are the, you know, what people do in adolescence and I would say what if you're different, what if you don't fit into that, you're an immigrant, you don't speak English, uh, you know, all those other variables that are cultural variables, and people say well, you just try to, you know, see if you can fit that in. So, even now you want to think about, you know, is there something missing in, in my supervision, is there something missing in my program? If it's missing, you don't usually know it's not there, but I'll give an example from my life. I was, um, I started at a, at a small college, um, at, within the University of Massachusetts, which is a big university, and this was a college that had a large ethnic minority population, but I think they had no Asian students at the time. And I interviewed for the position and I remember one of the colleagues said well, what is, you know, what are some things you like to do, and I said well I'm interested in working with Asian-Americans and they said we don't have any Asian-American students in this college, and I said well, you might want to think about why that's true. You have no Asian-American faculty and nothing in your curriculum, this is why you have no Asian-American students, and I gave them an analogy. It's like saying well, we don't have any, we don't need to worry about, uh, students in wheelchairs cause we don't have any. I said well yeah, because you don't have any ramps, you know. So you need to, so if you don't provide, as Joe said, the access, you don't have the ramps you don't have the students, you don't have the need for it, it's because, why is that? It's because something's missing. So, that's what you need to focus on, I think, in your training, is what's not here when you look at any curriculum working. 

00:13:55
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. Well, what's happening, and you can see it out here in this room, with the, uh, color complexion of young people in this room is, we're getting people from lived environments, lived experiences that have more experience with the population than the supervisor does. So, how can a supervisor teach them what they already have lived a lifetime, so you've got a power differential. So, it the client is of your same ethnicity and income level and the supervisor's from some other lived experience, now who is the expert? You tell me. Hm? And I know this from experience. There had never been a black client at the counseling center at Michigan State University in 1959. We were contenders for a national championship, football is big in Michigan State, and one of my, uh, soon to be clients, his grandmother who raised him here in the East, died on the floor of a factory in a hospital and the boy fell apart. Well, back then he wasn't supposed to be an all-American football player and be crying in the dorm at night, that just didn't work. So, Coach Dorothy sent him to the counseling center. Now, there was no black counseling psychologist there, there had never been a black client there, and I was in child clinical, I wasn't even supposed to be up in there. So, he wouldn't go back to the counseling center. He went to one interview and Darrel Sou wasn't around, he studied that one interview stuff. So anyway, they, uh, called the President of the University, the coach was mad and this and that and the other, and said you better find some Negroes, some colored people, something to counsel this boy. So, they said well, we got this one little Negro down in the children's clinic. So, they came in my clinic. Now, I'm working with children 12 and under, I've got playroom teddy-bears and this and that, they come up in that playroom and got me up out of there and said you're going to the counseling center. And I said what do you mean I'm going to the counseling center? I'm in child psychology. There are no children up in that counseling center. They said well no, you are in developmental psychology now, you was in child psychology. Some powerful white folks can change the rules any time they want. Don't tell me you can't change the rules. So, now we got an ethnic mat and a gender mat. The only issue is, now, my supervisor was a good man, he was not a racist. He grew up in a small town in Minnesota, no Negroes, went to the University of Minnesota, 20,000 student, 100 Negroes, was a psych major, no Negroes, Ph.D. in a great counseling program no Negroes, and so, and you got these two inner city boys, me and my client. Now, who's got the expertise, you tell me. Who's gonna teach me social justice, me or am I going to teach the supervisor. 

00:16:50
[laughter] 

00:16:55
[sil.] 

00:16:55
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. It's hard to talk. Any, any other thoughts? 

00:17:05
HEATHER E. BULLOCK, PH.D. I... 

00:17:10
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. About anything in particular? 

00:17:15
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN, PH.D. Well, I think it's crippling hard to top that. Um, that's incredible. Um, I think, going back to the question of what can early career professionals do, um, I have to say that, um, I think it's a process of just putting yourself, I think following up on the ideas here, throwing yourself into life experience but expanding your experiences and, um, really trying to expose yourself to new environments, new populations. Um, and do it in a way where you keep yourself open to your own experience, where you don't just go at it from a theoretical perspective, but you go at it you know, where you keep all of your feelings open to what, what you see. And, uh, I grew up in New York, and um, you know, I think, when I grew up here, it was, you know, some of the same things as today, but it was a lot different. In some ways, it was, it was a lot more, it was a lot more opportunities for people in terms of work in the inner city communities. So, just seeing what's happened over the years and myself having worked in the South Bronx in my summers off from college, working in Manhattan, um, having jobs in grad school at different community colleges. I think that was really what transformed me was the experience of working with clients keeping myself emotionally open to the experience. 

00:18:35
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Thank you. 

00:18:35
HEATHER E. BULLOCK, PH.D. I would just add to that, uh, to not be afraid to, um, blur boundaries. So, in the work that I do I focus primarily on class and classism, I'm a social psychologist and when I first started working in this area as a graduate student, it was really common for people to say to me aren't you a sociologist, aren't you doing sociology, and um, the answer to that is no I really am a social psychologist, but of course the work that I do draws on a variety of fields. And so, I would encourage, including sociology of course, I would encourage you not to be afraid to, um, blue disciplinary boundaries because I think if you are doing social justice work of any form, it inherently requires that you look at, um, politics and policy and sociology and a variety of ways of looking at the issues that you're working on. 

00:19:35
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Thank you. Beverly? 

00:19:40
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. Not really. Do you want me to make up something? 

00:19:45
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. No, not at all. One of the things that, uh, I think Joe, you began talking about relative to some of the, uh, students early career psychologists, certainly have their own lived experience relative to social justice issues, relative to discrimination, relative to oppression, and they may know more than their supervisor or even their faculty at times depending on where they are. For those individuals who are a little more seasoned out here and are mentoring students, how would you suggest those individuals begin thinking about mentoring, uh, assisting their students and developing that social justice aspect of their own experience? 

00:20:25
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. Well, I think what we need to do, Angela, or Dr. Angela, is I'm gonna use a double (inaudible )or something, here. Give the students the opportunity to empower themselves while they're empowering people. So, that we want the student to get the feel of how you empower people in a community and develop their expertise by doing that, and that, that then empowers them. Let me give you a concrete example. I grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but I've been in California all of my adult life. But anyhow, I happened to go back there one day and some people cornered me and say they needed some help in the community. So, I spent a week there talking to everybody and this mom, and I finally got 15 people together, 15 black people, and I asked them one question, two questions, what are the challenges facing the community in Minneapolis, meaning the black community obviously. And what do you want to do? You can go to any community in America where there are middle and low income black people, you get the same answer, education, healthcare, housing, workforce training. They might throw a couple of others in there, but that's what you're gonna get, sitting in a room. Now, when you're sitting in a room with black people, you have to remember you're in black culture, so they're not going to go in a linear line, they've got testifying and bearing witness, talking about the grandma working Alabama when she was six years old and cotton, and you've got to listen to all of that. You can't just go straight in a linear line. It would be taking 10 meetings to accomplish an hour's worth of work, you got it, but that's learning the culture. Then second thing is, okay, you define the issues, now what are we going to do about it, what are we going to do about education? You've got any ideas, you got any idea about healthcare, and there's people in the community with the resources to help you, you know, go to the university, have them do some research, give you the research and you go around town with the research and say this is what the experts say is going on in healthcare, and we need to change that. This is what's going on with the community. So now, we got five programs going in five cities, and they're fully functioning, they're doing stuff in education, they're doing stuff in healthcare and so forth. And in that process, they're finding out how the community works and who the decision makers are. That is hard to find out. We know who's elected, but we don't know who is the real big dog behind the scene, right. And I learned that my first time. I was a 30-year-old, 29-year-old young fella and I was trying to do the right thing, assistant professor and I lived in the hood because nobody would rent me a house because I was black. But anyhow, I lived in the hood and there was no stop sign on the corner where the kids had to cross to go to school. So, being I'm the only Ph.D. In the whole state of California that's black and in that neighborhood, people came to me for everything. They said, well our children got hit by a car trying to cross the street with no stop sign, would you help us out? And I'm like I'll help. You know I'm a child psychologist, I'll figure out this stop light thing. So, you know what I did? I got my graduate students and I stood on the corner when the children were going to school and we counted the number of kids, the number of cars, everything, the weather, whether it was raining, the sun was shining, and I called the city council, and I'm going down there to testify, and I'm up there testifying big time, you know. I mean, I've got my notes like I've got there, and, uh, my friend Willy Brown who was just starting in politics and became famous, heard I was down there testifying and he told me they are not the decision makers, the city council. I said what do you mean, Willy, they elected, they're the decision, he said no, no, no. That's not how it works, Joe. And he said there's three people who make decisions in this community, there's a rich white lady that lives by the ocean, there's the president of Standard Oil, and then there's a political organizer, and you go see them, and you get your stop light. So, I went to the lady's house, rich white lady in front of the ocean, and she served me cakes and cookies and so forth, and I wasn't a black then, I was still a Negro, colored. She said well you seem like a nice young colored man, and she said I don't want you going to the city council no more, I'll get your stop light. Now, see you got to find out if you're working in the social justice and you're trying to empower the community, you've got to find out who the decision makers are, who are the people, who are the shot callers. And you can't find that out sitting in this classroom, cause I sat in classroom til I was 29 years old, started when I was three, and it didn't work like they told me. No, that didn't work, not at all. It don't work for them either, but they know the inside game and we don't. You've got to learn the inside game, brother. 

00:25:30
CONNIE S. CHAN, PH.D. Joe, what was it that had her open the door to a young, you know, like you said, Negro guy like you at that age? Most, most rich white women wouldn't open the door to a man like you. 

00:25:45
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. Well, we were slowly, and by we I mean me and that little cadre of folks I was with, young lawyers, doctors and so on, about 10 of us in California. We were slowly learning the inside game, and Willy Brown had already started up the political ladder. He wasn't, uh, speaker of the assembly like our mayor, but he knew a little bit more than I did, because I'm supposed to be child psychology. So, Willy told me who to go see, and arranged the appointments, and I went and saw her. And the PhD got me in the door. She said well come in, doctor, of thank you, thank you. This cake is so nice, this coffee is... 

00:26:20
CONNIE S. CHAN, PH.D. Well, your name is Dr. White. 

00:26:20
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. That's right. It helps to have a few people skills. You don't have to be Uncle Tom, but you don't have to go in whooping nobody's ass. You be nice, the ass kicking can come later. Now, (inaudible ) you have to, you know, likability helps. 

00:26:40
CONNIE S. CHAN, PH.D. Well, I also like those kinds of stories, but I like working with, with um, trainees at early career psychologists, because I think at that stage, you know, anything's still possible because you haven't established where you're gonna go, and in your career, you think you're gonna go on one path, but all kind of additional things, you know, can come up and you can go somewhere else. Um, I guess what I would tell, uh, someone supervising an early career person is that you should not be afraid of making mistakes, and you should make mistakes. In fact, you should fail a couple of times before, you know, before you succeed. If you're not failing, if you're not, um, doing something that doesn't work out well, you try a test that you've never administered and you do it badly, that's okay, because if you don't try it, you're not going out of your comfort zone. So, to, to work on social justice, you have to sometimes fail and know that you're gonna fail. It's like, you know, watching those Olympics and people are falling before they can do great jumps. Um, you, you've got to know that sometimes when you're challenging, um, people who are, who have power and who are your supervisors or who are who are your teachers, they, what they learned 20 years ago is, was right for them, but it's not, it isn't in your lived experience now, and you know that's not quite right, you know, and you've got to challenge it and you've got to know that sometimes you're gonna be slapped for it, you know. You still don't have the power, you're a trainee and you're writing your dissertation and they say no no, that methodology isn't going to agree with that. You didn't, you don't, your sample wasn't right and you have to, um, you have to say okay, I, that didn't work, I'm going to try something else, you can't give up, and don't be afraid. 

00:28:25
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. Well, what Connie is talking about is non-linear learning. Most of school is linear learning, you know, I say you're going to go in here and I'm going to teach you the T-Test, you pass that and next week come in there and I'll teach you analysis, and come back here and we're going to do co-variants. That's linear learning, A follows B and C, D. Out in the world, you're talking about social justice, it's not linear, and so you have to be, what Tom Parham calls improvisation. You've got to be resourceful, you've got to be creative, you've got to be innovative, and Connie's trying to tell you you've got to be resilient. Because just because you think you're right, doesn't mean the world is gonna stop and listen to you. You know, and if you take on Goliath, let me tell you something, Goliath can fight. You know, David and Goliath in the Bible, you know, David was armed with righteousness and 10 rocks, well Goliath will whoop your ass. Yeah he will. 

00:29:25
[sil.] 

00:29:25
HEATHER E. BULLOCK, PH.D. Well, I think a piece of this for seasoned mentors is to listen more than you speak, and which I think is really, it can be challenging, I think, and um, I think sometimes although well meaning, um, mentors attempt to recreate themselves through the students that they work with, um, and trainees. And I think that's a, not a good path to go on. I think always listening more than you speak, um, is one of the greatest gifts you can give to, um, people that you're working with. 

00:30:00
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN, PH.D. I have a few thoughts. One is just to pick up on Joe's point. I think going into some of these difficulties like the way you presented going into the rich white lady's house, um, you had, you had a cohort of people with you, they may not have been with you that day, (inaudible)people you can bounce off of, provide you with sources of resilience and I think that can help a great deal. I think the other thing that I have found in mentoring, um, students and junior, junior colleagues is for me to be informed by them and for me to allow myself to be taught by them, um, it's very very important, and I think that has been, um, incredibly powerful for me over the course of my career to, for example, I have a student who wanted to, Matt Deemer, does research on critical consciousness, great construct, I love the variable, I love Paulo Fietti's work, totally love it, came to me in the early 2000s and said I want to do a study with critical consciousness and career development, and I think it's going to be predictive of some good outcomes. And I said I don't really see that, and he tried to explain it to me, and I said you know what, Matt, do it. Prove me wrong, I would love to be proven wrong, it would really, it would be fantastic finding. Not only did he prove me wrong, but it's one of the hottest variables right now in the field, and it's really fostering a lot of powerful interventions that are transformative. So, this conversation back at Boston College in my little office in the corner, where I said look, I'm not really sure this is going to fly, but um, I totally support you, and I think that has been a really important lesson, not to be too arrogant and not to have too much hubris. 

00:31:45
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. I guess I would just add that part of mentoring is being able to ask the right questions, because asking questions helps to shape thinking and hopefully thinking should, you know, comes before action, you know, that you want to consider what it is, what it is you're trying to do, where you're doing it, who you're doing it with, and be strategic about how you're gonna go about that. Um, because you're almost by definition, if you're engaging in social justice work, you're challenging a power hierarchy, and that isn't gonna just go away. And even if you win a battle today, there will be another one tomorrow. So, that's part of a process, it's not, it's never well, you do this and you're done. 

00:32:35
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Thank you. I'm going to switch gears a little bit. Um, certainly I think what you have been providing the audience in terms of your, your gained wisdom and experiences has been very helpful, and one of the things that they certainly may be interested in, I know I am, is how has your own lived experience informed your work and your development in social justice? 

00:33:00
[sil.] 

00:33:05
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. It's a stumper. But certainly we are focusing on how one's lived experience really does inform us and how it shapes how we think, what we think, how we can be strategic at some point, how we can stay open, how we can be resilient and Connie, I think one of the things that you said in terms of being willing to fail, that is a very difficult pill for most people, most of us. But in that failure, as it may be seen at that moment, it certainly may be a win in the long term. But it only takes time to see that. That each of you obviously has experienced your own set of downfalls, challenges, um, and hearing from you and how you've dealt with that, how you've overcome that, how you continue to persevere and move forward and endure, I think would be really helpful for the audience to hear how those experiences have shaped what you do. 

00:34:05
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. Well, I would say when you grow up on the margins, you know there are margins. Um, you know there's a margin and there's a center and you know that there are different lenses for the ways that people see and understand the world in ways that I think people who are dominant don't. That, for them, that is what the world is. Um, but you're also aware of the reality of power, and when you can challenge power and when you can't, um, I, in my own experience, I think I was very fortunate that I had parents and elders who grew up in the deep south and understood very well when you challenge and when you don't. Um, because your survival depends on that, and who were very overt in teaching the children in our family about who we were and what that meant in terms of what that was going to illicit in other people. But to understand that, that while other people can create problems for you, you are not the problem. Managing their behavior is the problem, and that you have to pick your battles, that if you are, um, a marginalized person, um, you know, their thinking of episode of, um, visiting family in the deep south when I was a child, where, um, racial segregation was clearly quite rigid. Um, and as a sort of Yankee child, being outraged by that, and you know, making scenes in various places with my mother about why we can't go in there and we should anyway, and what are they gonna do about it, and of course, not realizing they're going to kill us, probably, um, and you know, coming, coming to understand that people accommodate those things differently depending on where they are, depending on how much they have to do, because you can't let it take over your life either, you know, you have to be able to struggle but you also have to live. And striking a balance and understanding when to, when to take on this battle and when to say no, you know, um, is not failure, it's recognizing you're not going to win every battle. So, you, you choose carefully and think about your energy and what you want to do with that. 

00:36:30
CONNIE S. CHAN, PH.D. I'm going to pick up on the marginalized issue. Um, I think lived experience is not just very important, it really is the core of what you bring, um, to your work as a, as a researcher and as a position, um, and as an advocate. So, my lived experience was that my family were, were immigrants from, um, from China. They were refugees, and I was one and a half when I came to the United States, so I didn't really speak English til I was about four or five, you know, watching the Mickey Mouse club on TV to learn English. My parents didn't speak English to me. So, I was always acutely aware that I was in this country where I didn't really understand, you know, the language and my parents were, you know, like many many immigrants, they suffered from, um, from fear and loss. So, my, like, many immigrant experiences, it was characterized by America as a sense of a place of, um, um hope and refuge, but also a place that was dangerous to us, that we didn't belong, and that I didn't fit in, um, from from an, you know, since I can remember. I have sort of a funny story, it's both sad and funny at the same time, when we went, I went to kindergarten, um, in San Francisco, when I was five and my mother took me to kindergarten, and picked me up and, you know, started speaking to me in Chinese as we went home, and there were some other kids around, and they looked up when she was talking to me in Chinese, and I didn't say anything as we got home, I said to her, I said don't ever speak to me in Chinese again in front of other people, and my mother said you know, well what am I going to talk to you in? That's the only language we know, and I said well I don't want people to know that we're different, that we're Chinese, you know. And she's like I hate to tell you, but they can tell. But I didn't, you know, you're five years old, you want to, you know, it's my first American educational experience, I wanted to fit in, uh, I didn't want people. And for years, you know, it wasn't until many years later that I was, um, so happy that I could speak Cantonese and worked in the Chinese community. For years, I always kind of felt embarrassed when my family would go out, and we'd go out to eat and we were even in Hawaii and people would, and we would speak Cantonese, and I'm like you need to just keep it down so people don't look at us and listen to us. But, those kind of experiences, you know, you never forget that you're sort of marginalized, that you're different. I think in a way that, you know, as you get older and you have other differences, you know, whether they be for sexual orientation or whether, you know, you're, um, I don't know, whether you're a scientist in a clinical program or something, you understand that you, um, as Beverly says, you kind of work within those margins. You know that you're slightly different, you know that you're, you're not in the mainstream, but you hold on to what, um, what resilience you can, you can gain from that, and over time it becomes a strength, although you know, at the time that I was a kid, I didn't think that speaking another language, um, was a strength. 

00:39:40
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. Well, I think you have to be clear in this field, social justice, about the realities that you are trying to change. So, when I came out of graduate school 52 years ago, there was no such word as social justice, or if there was I hadn't heard it. But I knew that something was not right in this reality called psychology. Something was not right. And I was the fourth black person in America to get a PhD in clinical psychology, and if I had known that I never would have gone into the field, you know, I had tunnel vision. But anyway, me and a few other people. We took a second look at psychology and there were two things that were real clear. First is we were invisible in psychology. You can go to APA and you would be there three days and you might see one Negro down the hall, and you'd run as fast as you could to say hello. That was, that was back then, okay. So, we were invisible. You go to any library here in this university and get any book written before 1970, and you won't find us in the book. And every now and then there might be a half a page that said you'd got low IQ, and you can't do a complex task, and you have poor impulse control, and right down the street is a big old university called Columbia, right? And big time psychologists, one who was president of APA, testified before the Armed Services Committee of the United States Congress, that black kids were too dumb to fly airplanes. It's right in the Congressional testimony. Now, I'm reading this and I'm saying this isn't right. I don't accept this reality that you white folks have written up, cause I wouldn't write no psychology saying I was dumb and full of pathology, I won't do that. And I had the lived experience. My mother raised three children by herself, working two jobs, got us fed, educated, clothed, kept us out of trouble. Now, if that's not a complex task, I don't know what is one. Don't tell me about your little test you've got. So, now I'm revved up, Tom had to come along and roll his identity theory, but I'm moving out of the preencounter stage. I'm saying this ain't right. So, then by the time there were 10 of us, it was 1968, we go to APA. Now, we're going to tell them we don't like you all's reality. So, first of all, we had to meet with the executive committee of the APA, and it was two days to set up the meeting. So, there were 10 of them and 10 of us. So, we've been in the civil rights movement mad and raising our fist and black power, whatever. So, I asked a very simple question, I said why would you write a psychology where we were invisible and not even included and when we were included, say we was dumb and ugly and can't do a complex task. So first thing he said was don't talk to me that way. I said what do you mean don't talk to you that way? You know, I've done had my ass whooped for 400 years, it's not going to hurt you to be talked to for 10 minutes, so don't pull that on me. So then, the meeting deteriorated, the mother word was used. I'm not gonna say I used the mother word, I will admit I was at the meeting. And I told them I said look here, home boy, have you ever heard of, of the sociology of knowledge? What happens is you grow up in a culture that tells you you're superior and these other people is dumb and ugly, and you grow up with that idea already in your head before you come to the graduate school. Then when you go to graduate school and you do your research, you reproduce what you already have learned, right? They didn't write a psychology saying they was dumb and ugly and evil people, hmm? So then, we decided we would now attempt to create another reality, we haven't changed the whole of psychology, but I believed change begins with self and works outward. So, before we go changing everybody and his momma, we've got to look at what we are doing as psychologists and figure out where, where we do the self-examination, are you with me? And, uh, there are more people in this room right now than were in psychology in 1968. So, something is changing, I don't know what, but it is changing.

00:44:10
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Heather? David? 

00:44:15
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN, PH.D. I could chime in. 

00:44:15
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Go ahead. 

00:44:20
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN, PH.D. First off, it's hard to chime in, you know, in a sense that I'm very aware that, um, my growing up years I did have the advantage of being a white male, and uh, clearly was aware of it, um, although not in a kind of complex thinking way at all. Um, but I guess in relation to two points, one is being an ally in the racial and civil rights racial justice and civil rights movement that was really integral to my life. Um, and I'm not sure how I got it, I mean my parents, the thing I'll speak about is my parents. They, they were real blue collar working class people, in some ways not typical of Jewish people in New York, my father was a sheet metal mechanic, was a tradesman, my mom worked in a department store, um, old department store there called May's some of you remember it. Um, lousy store. Um, no benefits, but, um, there was definitely financial hardship in my family. We lived in a tiny apartment out in East (inaudible ) financial hardship (inaudible ). Um, I'd joke with my brother that, and I don't remember complaining about this. Has anybody ever head of Glen Oaks village out in Easter Queens? That's where we lived, in this tiny, like 800 square feet apartment, and we ate, there was no dining, we ate in the kitchen, a tiny kitchen, and I always sat by the refrigerator. I don't know how, I was the youngest one, and I was always getting up and getting food out of there, and I don't think I (inaudible ) sit at the table all at once. I don't think they liked that particular comment, but um, but back to the, to the issue of what early on, I think it was, um, first off, it was, it was Bobby Kennedy's 1968 campaign, I was about 13 or 14 years old, and um, here's an example of, I think, where I knew I might have some, some energy on this issue was that I joined the campaign, I mean, it wasn't like I was an adviser, I was taking a bus to Jamaica Queens to stuff envelopes, but I didn't do it with a group of friends. So, it was like an independent activity, I was very turned on to this campaign, I really felt like he got it in terms of poverty and justice and I really was devastated when he was shot, and I felt like that was a transitional point for me. Um, and then I think as I got older and realized issues around economic justice, and saw how my parents really struggled, my mom never got past 8th grade, they really didn't have a lot of, um, we didn't have a lot of social capital in our family. It's amazing I got into Teacher's College and knew how to interact as a professor there. I guess I was okay then. Um, but, um, you know, no one really was kind of giving me any advice or anything. Um, but I think out of that experience grew enormous empathy for the poor, for people of color and enormous acknowledgment of the privileges I did have and how lucky my family was to get out of Europe over 100 years ago to escape the Holocaust, you know, how incredibly, the privilege of that alone was unbelievable to me. To know that my grandparents had the foresight to leave Europe and like that experience of the immigrants that there's a little known story that about one fourth of all the Eastern European Jewish immigrants who came over then went back to Europe because they were so homesick and ended up perishing in the Holocaust. So, we have to give my grandparents a lot of credit for staying here, as hard as it might have been, uh, during a period when it was not a culturally affirming period. They, their decision was to learn English and fit in as fast as they could. There were no ifs ands or buts about it. So, there was a lot of sacrifices, but I think there was some kind of quality of my family that they were very empathic and, um, I remember we lived in the south in Florida in the 50s, and they drove me through a segregated area, and they said this is just horrible, how people lived, you know, the southerners are horrible, we need, and part of that was one of the reasons why they moved back to New York. So, there was some kind of crucible in my family that really helped me, and then sitting in that little kitchen gave me more empathy. 

00:48:40
HEATHER E. BULLOCK, PH.D. Well, I, I think, um, the personal really is political, and the work that I do now is really tied, I think, to experiences I had growing up. Um, my family, uh, was both middle class and very poor, um, during my childhood and adolescence. So, I think at a young age, that gave me a sensitivity to social class and to the, I think the fragility of class status. Um, and, and the ease of downward mobility, um, and I certainly was, uh, when I was younger, I think this, it goes back to some of your comments, I was very embarrassed about my family's economic situation, particularly we lived in a very middle income sort of town, and um, we lost our house, it was very public, um, we used food stamps, I had free lunch, and I was really embarrassed about those things. And I also, I think though, understood, although I don't think I could have articulated it at the time, um, some of the privileges I had, too. I think I recognized as a low income white student where I was treated in school was certainly different than, um, low income students of color, my peers, and for me, I think I really developed a critical consciousness when I went to college and one of the things that I would say contributed to that was being a work study student and my work study job at the United Way, and I think it was the first time that I really realized how pervasive economic hardship was, and saw my own experience as something bigger and larger than just my personal experience. Uh, and then I think making those connections with race and gender were all things that happened through taking feminist studies courses, and even some psychology courses that I think opened my eyes. 

00:50:55
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Thank you. It certainly sounds like each of your experiences has given you the one, insight and a nuanced understanding of how the social reality that people often live by can be changed, and how your own experience was a, uh, was one that you had to have faith in in terms of knowing that this was what you're committed to, and how that commitment can then be included in your work. 

00:51:25
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN, PH.D. Can I just chime in with one more point, is that okay? 

00:51:30
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Sure, definitely. 

00:51:30
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN, PH.D. There was something else that some of you who are my age, around my age might remember, the Vietnam war protests, and um, I think (inaudible [00:51:387]) with me because I you know, there were amazing protests and I was involved with some of them, um, but there was a certain core, there was a certain element of folks involved in it who were involved in it just because they were afraid of getting drafted. For some of them, it wasn't about social justice, and I saw some of my friends who were involved in that movement, as soon as the war was over, became right win Republicans, um, right along on that path, and you know, I don't want to indict the whole Vietnam anti-war movement because clearly it was a major movement and it did help to bring the war to a close earlier than it would ordinarily would have, but I began to really discern the complexity of social justice. This wasn't all about, you know, you know, Joe Smith getting, or whoever it is, um, getting drafted. It was really about if, for me, it was really about power and control and seizing power from, you know, corporate military industrial complex. So, I began to see hypocrisy, I don't know if some of you would remember that, in some of the anti-war demonstrations. 

00:52:40
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Yes, I'm sure some of us do. And some out there are too young for that. But, um, I think they all understand what that kind of hypocrisy can mean. Um, Joe, you said that you think that some things have changed in psychology. And I'm curious as to how you all see your work as providing some of that change in that reality that we, that we know at least, theoretically. 

00:53:15
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. Well, I think what happened is when the conversation started in 1968, about psychology, and we challenged them on the basis of race, I think that opened up a conversation. Up to that time there had been no conversation in psychology about that. So, the graduate schools then tried to get one black graduate student and one Chicano and this and that, and then what they didn't foresee in addition to the people of color coming into psychology, the women came too. So, now when you've got, uh, half of APA being women and then we make up another 17, 16 percent, something's gonna change, when you've got the numbers. Vietnam was talking about, people was out in the street demonstrating and carrying on. There was some numbers out there whether they were hypocritical or not, they were out there. 

00:54:10
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN, PH.D. They were out there. 

00:54:10
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. They were out there. And if you're gonna work for social change, if you're gonna work for social justice, you have to access the power centers, I mean that theme has run throughout this conversation. Because otherwise you can have brilliant ideas, but if you ain't got no power, you're not gonna change nothing, but that's just talk up in the university seminar. But if you're gonna get out into the world and make change, or even in universities, you have to access the power centers. And people who make the decisions, whether corporate structure, whoever, the Army, whoever the decision makers. But the change that I have seen is now sitting in this room. That's the change. And I think it's a great thing for this profession and for America. 

00:55:05
[sil.] 

00:55:05
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. How have others seen, um, the change if, if you share that vision or if you share that thought? Certainly your work has made, um, significant impact in the field. 

00:55:20
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. Well, we're visible. Um, when I was in graduate school, you know, that we were completely invisible still, except in very pejorative apologizing ways. Um, and I mean we in the broadest possible sense. Um, so, that has changed. I don't know that the, the dominant paradigm has necessarily changed a lot in terms of, um, being, the field having more of a willingness to critique social pathology and not individuals for the way they respond to social pathology. Um, so that, I think, is still very challenging because that really speaks to the heart of power, and you know, who controls what and for whom, and who benefits and who doesn't. Um, but certainly that has changed. That you can talk about it has changed. Um, when I was in graduate school, if you suggested that perhaps, um, what was seen as a paranoid disposition in a black male in a situation where he should be, the hyper vigilant or that meant maybe something was wrong with him. Um, just to say that, you know, you'd be seen as over-identifying or something negative. You know, that's sort of like everybody's the same here. It was really an unwillingness to in any reasonable kind of way, interrogate that. There was a sense of well, we got you all here and you should be, you know, you know, happy little darkies that you're here, but don't go try to change the way anything is seen or change the shape of the table. 

00:57:10
HEATHER E. BULLOCK, PH.D. Well, I think that you point to that, uh, I don't know, the ongoing constant struggle to make social context and structural forces visible. I mean, I think that that is, I think that there's increased recognition, but I think in psychology, and even in our society more broadly, that it's always a struggle because we are a very individualistic society. We're, you know, meritocracy is such a deeply embedded belief that I think, as a field, and as a society, there's always this struggle to make, uh, structural facets at the forefront. 

00:57:55
[sil.] 

00:58:00
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Okay. So, in some ways, it's, I really am resonating to your point, Bev, when you, uh, said that it's the social context that we may not be examining as much in terms of how then individuals respond to those social context that may appear to be apparent or filled with psychopathology. And yet, we're still kind of in that how to do that. 

00:58:30
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. Well, I don't know that the how is the issue. I think a willingness to open the Pandora's box of what happens when you say well, but this individual is trying to cope with something that they shouldn't have to cope with. And there are reasons that that thing they're coping with exists because it benefits people in power in some way. And let's just be honest about that, and, and not just talk about the way the person responds, but they're responding to something. And because we can't sort of individually go out and change that structure, doesn't mean that it's not important to acknowledge what is being responded to. And the pathology that's inherent in a lot of what's being responded to, you know, that a lot of the, uh, the quest for materialistic nature of our society and where that comes from, um, a lot of what uh, Cornell West talks about is sort of, uh, death denying kinds of behaviors where, you know, if, you know, the more you have, you won't die. Well, yeah you will. Um, you know, so it, it's about valuing life as opposed to material things. And that I think, that's still a struggle, and I think it's even permeated religious institutions where there is kind of this message of, uh, the more you have the better. Um, without a sense of what, more what, and what does that mean. 

01:00:05
CONNIE S. CHAN, PH.D. I think there's a lot of reason to be hopeful, um, for psychology, because I, when I think back on, um, you know, 19- 1970s and going to, you know, as a graduate student going to an APA convention in Los Angeles and hear Evelyn Hoker speak and talk about how her, you know, study on, on gay men, um, changed the way people looked at homosexuality as a pathology and deviance, and where we are now on, um, marriage equality, that psychology's played a major role and, you know, those of us who have been involved in Division 44 and psychology, I think we can be very, um, proud and hopeful that psychology itself and, and lesbians and gays and bisexual psychologists have played a major role in providing so much of the, the background evidence and theory around, um, sexual orientation and homosexuality not as a pathology but as a variance of, um, normal, normal sexual behaviors. So, that that, to me, when I teach about, um, psychology as a positive social movement, I always talk about, uh, how psychology made a huge difference in public policy, um, area around legislation on same sex marriage. But, you know, it's I think that's one step and, you know, and the fact that most of the licensing exams in states require some sort of diversity training in, um, excuse me, in your professional psychology background, that's a step. Those are all small steps, but, you know, they've been building together. But I think that the, you know, and Joe says you're the audience, you're the young people, um, the future of psychology. You can, these are examples of where psychology can play a major role in, in public policy issues that, um, that it can play a major role in looking at, you know, gender, you know. We, we say oh well, you know, the women's movement has come and gone and, you know, we have, you know, women's issues are are not, they're not always in the forefront, but gender issues have not progressed very far. And I think that as psychologists, which is a field that has more women than, then men, um, we're not looking at the gender inequality, uh, across, across institutions and across, you know, our career professional success either. So, there are many areas that you can still push that were still marginalized that psychology has not pushed far enough and that we can, um, play a larger role in, in justice and you know, many of you know about the military, um, questioning, uh, at Guantanamo and such, and so we have to play a major role in that around, around you know, um, where there are suitable practices for psychology to play in interrogation in inquiry, what's just and what role we can play around those peace issues, too. 

01:03:20
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN, PH.D. Um, can I chime in? I think, I think first of all, I think there have been some positive changes. I mean, I will say as a grad student here at Teacher's College, I came to the first two round tables, um, and our program then, in the early 80s, actually, was one of the first that had a multicultural, I think we called it cross cultural then, uh, perspective. And, um, I'm very proud to be part of that and very proud to be part of that, I think it was the first round table where we had the blizzard. Um, but so, there has been change and I think that, again, looking at this audience we can see the change in front of us. Um, and psychology's been, I think, very effective, I think, on the LGBT issue, enormously effective. They've also been very effective in, um, cutting cigarette smoking, big behavioral health interventions, made a huge difference. I think that we're getting push back from parts of psychology and parts from the society in general on other issues, um, issues around intelligence and race, those are issues that are still debated in psychology, um, in journals like the American Psychologist. So, those issues are not marginalized. Um, and then in areas that are important to me in my work, issues around employment and unemployment, we need to get much more involved in that debate. APAs been somewhat involved in it, but what I tell my students, it's a very interesting story, that during the Nixon, Kennedy debates, which I don't remember watching, um, they had a vociferous debate about unemployment. Unemployment rate then was two percent. So, um, we have grown to accept lack of access to work as part of the norm of this society. I think we have to make changes in that area with the same level of energy and social justice vigor. When people don't have access to work, it destroys the core essence of who they are as a person. It destroys communities and I feel like that's, um, that's one of the things that keeps me going in terms of having a kind of specific social justice mission that everyday I wake up and try to figure out what would I do about that. So, um, I think there's a lot more we can do and a lot more we can do in association. We can't leave that argument alone, because (inaudible ) well this is back before the recession, we had five percent unemployment, this is actually a quote that\s partially for employment. Now, speaking of linear... 

01:05:45
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Unless you don't have a job. 

01:05:45
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN, PH.D. If you're a linear thinker, there's something in that equation that doesn't work. You don't have to be a philosopher of logic to pull that thing apart. So, I think those are issues that we still need to step up the plate on that involve race that involve gender, that involve immigration, that involve disability. 

01:06:05
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. So true, so true. So, how do you think that social justice can be included in the leadership aspect of APA as a formidable organization? 

01:06:25
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. Well, I think as a beginning, if you look at the leadership of APA now, um, and I don't think that just changing demographics necessarily changes structure. Um, you have to look at what people stand for. Um, but this is not your father's APA. Um, there's an African American man who's the chief financial officer of APA, um, an African American man who is the chief executive officer, um, you know, I just recall looking at the, the officials of APA during Mel Bvaskis' presidency and thinking this is not the APA that I joined many many years ago. Um, so I think bringing people to leadership who have that sensitivity, and who've demonstrated that sensitivity, is important. 

01:07:20
HEATHER E. BULLOCK, PH.D. I think making sure that APA has the institutional structures to take action, so um, you know, a strong public interest directorate that works on behalf of a broad range of social justice issues, a government relations office that's charged with direct advocacy of bringing, um, our knowledge to policy makers. It's absolutely crucial. 

01:07:50
CONNIE S. CHAN, PH.D. Another way that the public, and certainly, um, students interact with APA is through the publications and journals, and I don't, I think there's a lot more that could be done there, uh, in terms of what's published as kind of, you know, what's seen as the truth or reality of what's going on, and there's, there's not enough social justice issues and inclusion brought up in the traditional APA journals. People, you know, APA has a sort of strong public interest directorate and, um, and some of the visibility of APA, you know, has been on social justice issues like LGBT issues and women's issues, but if you look at the main structure in terms of where, where people get their, their research, the publications are, you know, the editors and such it's, um, it's very it's much more traditional in terms of, um, sort of the, the access points. The gates are sort of closed, and I know that, I'm associate editor of an APA journal called, you know, Professional Psychology Research and Practice, and even a lot of our, the submissions that come to me as action editor, lots of times they don't address issues of diversity at all. They talk about, I'm doing a special issue on the military right now, military treatment, and they just talk about Veterans and military, and if I read it, I think well first, you're generally only talking about men, so there are, you know, certainly lots of women, uh, veterans in military that don't seem to be, uh, covered. And then, you know, it seems to me they're not really focusing on, um, other issues with diversity like, um, like you know, ethnic minority and and certainly not with sexual orientation. So when I write back in the action letter, you know, what did your sample have, what was the breakdown of your sample in terms of demographics. Lots of times they say, well too small a sample to break out ethnic, to break out race, or too small a sample, or not enough women were, were involved. So, we didn't bring up gender. So, I think that's, that's an important area. 

01:10:00
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. That's why your presence is important, because if you're among the gate keepers, I mean we certainly know, um, about journal publishing, you know, if they decide well, we don't like that, so you know, it's not gonna get published. That can be used, you know, the benefit, um, people who are marginalized as well, you know. If you, um, I think, uh, Jan Yoder in Psych Women Quarterly sort of instituted a policy that every article has to, at some point, include practice implications. So, it's sort of like well, this is a nice piece of research, but what does this mean, in terms of how is this relevant, how can people use this, um, I think you can do similar things around, um, you know, you still see, uh, titles of things that suggest their generalizable to an audience that, you know, was never included in the sample. Well, you can choose not to publish things, you know, who do that, or who, or challenge them to restrict what they say, uh, to the population that they sampled. Um, and you know, to be clear that unless you're seeing that kind of diversity in the samples, I mean, we talked, this is the field of representative sampling. So, duh, you know. What happens, um, you know, on the way to getting published, that that's, that that's sort of gets ignored. Um, but it also means that people have to be willing to serve on those boards and to do editorial review, which is not always a thrilling task. 

01:11:35
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. Well, what I'm thinking is that we have this profession called psychology, many of us (inaudible ) young people coming into it. And we have an organization such as APA, which is supposed to represent us, right. And so, we've learned over the years, I think, where the, the power centers are within APA, you know, and we need to now guide another generation of young people into leadership positions in APA, share with them what we think we've learned, realizing that we live in a changing world. And not only get people elected to be the president, but people in key positions within the organization. We've been in it long enough, now, to know where the leaders of power are. And then APA, if psychologists are gonna have more power in this society to work for social justice or whatever, have to become more politically savvy, like the AMA, bless their hearts, the American Medical Association, they are very politically savvy. And they put their money where their mouth is. That's why it took us 80 years to get to the healthcare bill passed. So, now we've got to get more savvy on working with the state legislature and with the, uh, people over on the Hill in DC, and it's a shame that there are only three psychologists among 435 members of the House of Representatives. One of them is from California, Alan Long, who just got elected. So, but, if we're going to have forward moving, forward movement on social justice, we have to become more sophisticated working within our own organization, what's that mentorship we were talking about mentoring some of the young people so they understand how the power levers work. And you know, guide them and then we get more politically savvy to get some power, cause you're not going to change enough without power. Believe me. You can be the most brilliant student in the world, but you'd be talking to that wall. Hm? 

01:13:50
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Thank you. I guess with this next question, I have advisees myself, and I mentor some students as well, and sometimes when I talk with them about social justice issues, they certainly want to be active in the community, they want their research to reflect particular issues that they see both in their own communities as well as other communities. But some of them say you know, I just don't think I have the fight. I don't know if I'm up for the fight. Some want to, are thinking about, uh, being involved in APA governance, but I may be the only one in the room. I just don't know if I have the fight. What would you say to that student? Cause I wonder, so it will help me. 

01:14:35
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. No, it's a good question, it's a good question. 

01:14:40
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. Well, I know what helped me, and that was that, uh, you have to be connected to, um, a history of something, that this is part of a struggle that's larger than yourself. That something was going on before we were here, you know, people have had this conversation before, um, and that will continue long after we're gone, you know, that it's, that's the nature of things. Um, and that somehow, people before us figured out a way in circumstances that were really awful, and if you think about, um, I, certainly, you know, think in terms of what life must have been like, you know, 75 years ago for, um, people who are very members of various marginalized groups, and just the sheer amount of crap they had to put up with, and still live, you know. That back then there was no such thing as, uh, political correctness, and people could be as insulting, um, you know, and as hurtful as they chose to be. And somehow you, you know, folks had to suck that up and still kind of, you know, keep on keeping on. So, I think it's important to remember that, that this is, this is not the first time this discussion has come up, um, that it's just, it's just part of being alive. You know, it's just part of what one does. But other people figured it out with fewer resources and a lot more barriers. Somehow, if they could figure it out, you know, then we can figure it out. 

01:16:15
CONNIE S. CHAN, PH.D. I think I would tell, um, the student that that you have to do what you're passionate about, and you have to do what's important to you, and I remember, and I still have this conversation, actually, with some young assistant professors. You know, people are so concerned about getting tenure now, so they say well, you know, this is the field and I think I can get tenure in this area, and you know, I'm, if I do stuff on, you know, gay stuff or ethnic minority stuff or, you know, women's issues, that's kind of seen as, you know, not, not central, you know, maybe I should focus on, you know, some kind of pathology instead because everybody, I can get that in a journal, clinical and counseling, so I call it consulting psychology. And I saw well, can you wait that long, can you wait six years to get tenure and then do the work that you're passionate about, and I remember I was given advice when I started as an assistant professor. My work was in sports psychology, and I'd had some stuff published on exercise addiction, and every one of my mentors who were, um, who were men, psychologists, said don't do stuff on women and Asian women and don't do stuff on, uh, lesbian, you know, lesbian psychologists because that's not seen as central. You want to have a, I couldn't be, that could be seen as a niche field and they will say well, we don't really have the need for that in the psychology department. We want someone who can teach, you know, sports psychology or addiction, because that's always gonna be important to them. And you should wait, it's only six years, you should wait til you get tenure, and then, and then do that work. And so, I sort of started in sports psychology, but after a couple years, you know, a year, I said you know, but there's nothing being done in the stuff I'm really interested in, and if I'm not gonna do it, you know, who's going to do it. I'm not reading anything on, you know, Asian American women who, you know, who, uh, that's interesting to me. So, I said you know, a lot of people, I just said I'm just gonna have to do what I'm passionate about and if I don't get tenure, well then, you know, I'll do something else. You know, so I think, you know, you, I don't think there's a choice. I don't think it's like well, I don't have, I don't have that fight. If your whole heart and your core and your soul and your passion isn't in it, then your work's not gonna be as vital to you, it's not, it's not, you're not living your true authentic experience. 

01:18:35
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. It's also not an either or. 

01:18:40
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. I think, uh, for young people who are thinking about jumping into the fight, it's important to find some role models, people who are doing it, it's important to find some allies, and it's important to understand how the system works so you can work the system. You're all talking about this tenure. Now, I have three daughters, two of them in higher education. Now, one of them is a geologist, a hard scientist, so she gets this job, assistant professor, and she decided for some reason or other, that she wanted to work in the community. She wanted to go out to the middle schools and teach these children about these rocks and fossils and things, and take them out to the field. So, I gave her $1,000 and the PTA gave her $1,000. So, she starts out working with these kids because minority kids, low income kids, they think if you're in the sciences, you're pre-med. They don't realize there's careers in science. You know, so she's trying to take them out there in the field so that professors called her in, the senior people, and said look here. At this university, she was at San Francisco State, the way you earn tenure is to publish. And you're not publishing, and you're out there with these kids. So, then she jumped up and said well my father told me I could do this. They told her your father don't work here. He's not on your (cross talk). But unbeknownst to them, see, the little girl had learned how to work the system and they didn't realize that she was going to get a million dollar grant from the National Science Foundation, she was going to get another million dollar grant from the US Department of Education because her father wired it up. So, so, then these same professors, who told her not to be doing that want a summer job, hm? A little income coming in, right, hm? And there was no more talk about this tenure business, right. So, I'm saying that's just one example, don't let the system work you. You need to learn how to work the system, am I right or wrong, Tom? He's my backup. So, I try to teach my students, my mentees, and my three children, the other one's the Vice President of a university, her older sister who's 56, I try to teach them how to work the system. And I didn't really teach them that, they were just around me all the time, and, and children, children see everything, but they shut up about this tenure thing when she got that two million dollars, and there was this big old write up in the San Francisco Chronicle, young geologist helping young people in the hood, Chinatown. 

01:21:20
[sil.] 

01:21:20
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. You're going to open it up? 

01:21:25
HEATHER E. BULLOCK, PH.D. I, I would just, I would echo everything that has already been said, and I would just simply add that I would tell a student in that situation that they are, they are not alone, that they are, I think sometimes when you're a student and you're doing work that is alternative or perceived, it feels different in some way, it can feel very isolating and alone. Um, the reality is you're, you're not alone, there is a network and a community of social justice oriented scholars across areas of psychology, um, who are there, um, who will be there to, um, help guide you across your own path. 

01:22:10
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN, PH.D. And (inaudible ) the point that Beverly made was that, um (inaudible ) either or, people may not feel that they have the emotional resilience at a given point to do the hard work that needs to get done. But they need to think about this developmentally that they may need to take care of some needs first, put things in place and then start taking more action. I think also, the choice of issues to get into, a person is an academic or clinician, the kinds of population one wants to work with. That speaks volumes about one's commitment as well. (inaudible ) and then finally, um, relational support is critical. So, it's hard to go into a battle (inaudible ). So, having allies, having (inaudible ) touch base with can actually (inaudible ). 

01:23:06
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. And there are many different ways to fight battles, that's true. Very well said. Um, we'd like to open this up to the audience for questions. And I'll, okay, there's a mic right there. So, just feel free to come up to the mic, ask questions. 

01:23:30
UNKNOWN Um, I'd like to thank you all on the panel for the struggle that you were all a part of, and for the work that you (inaudible ) so that we can work with you (inaudible ). Uh, my question is how do you convince young people there is still struggle? I found myself competing with, uh, YouTube and videos and, um, things that supposedly come quickly even though they don't, success that supposedly comes quickly but doesn't, and I found myself competing with that, and I found myself having to educate a lot of young people that hey,there's still a struggle out there, we're not where we want to be, and then I also have the problem of it being a collective struggle, uh, because people don't feel connected anymore, or as connected even though we have all these resources that are supposed to connect us. Um, so my question is two part, one how do I convince young people that there is a struggle, and how do I do that when the struggle is largely individual? 

01:24:40
[sil.] 

01:24:40
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. (inaudible ) 

01:25:00
HEATHER E. BULLOCK, PH.D. Yeah, I mean, I think you're touching on, um, some really important points and issues, and I think that certainly, um, I think with any social justice struggle and especially in our society, there is a tendency to see it as an individual rather than a bigger collective structural issue. That, that is a real challenge, and it's a challenge on many fronts across a whole range of different types of issues. Uh, I think that one thing that I, I might suggest, particularly around working, um, with youth, but this could perhaps be true of any group, is allowing, um, and making space for the group that you are working with, to define what's important to them. So, I think about, um, participatory action research, for example, and the possibilities that that can open for, um, marginalized groups, disadvantaged groups, to define issues in their own terms, and then I think, you know, it can be really a process to connect, um, what could seem to be a small issue to larger issues. So, I think about some participatory action research, for example, um, that examines the conditions of public schools and although that might seem like a particular issue like a lack of resources in a particular school, as just that one community, of course it is not. It's tied to the distribution of resources more broadly. So, I think, I think with any kind of work, um, you need to start at that beginning space of what is important to that group and kind of work from there and build. And I think the challenge for all of us, and this is a challenge for me, uh, true challenge, is for us as psychologists to think about how to communicate in different ways, and how to use social media in different ways. Please don't ask me to answer this question, I cannot, uh, I'm struggling with this myself, so I'm hoping people have some answers that will (inaudible ) we need to think about how we can use social media to our advantage so that, um, we're not, we're not lost to YouTube and those other sources. 

01:27:25
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. I think in response to your question, what's your first name? 

01:27:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible) 

01:27:30
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. That I was sitting here thinking, you can't convince young people of anything. But what you are doing is planting a seed. So, even though they may not react today, three years later it might pop open. That's what he was talking about, it's lack of planting a seed. Secondly, that we use, I think, it's effective to use the medium that the kids use, so they use verbal, you know, medium, you know rap or poets, this and that and the other, they use a talk medium. So, I think we need to use that medium, some of that rap music, some poems, poet-poetry slam whatever they do, and work the social issues in through the medium that they're already fairly familiar with. And I think those kids know beyond what their behavior says. They know there's a struggle, I think. They know that, they may not want to deal with that when they're 15, but they know there's a struggle. Big time. And also, I'm thinking of what David experienced with Bob Kennedy, that I had a grandmother all me about eight and nine years ago, she wanted to get her grandson into the Obama campaign. So, I got them connected, and the boy went down there and he just took off, he's 17 now, getting ready for college, or maybe a freshman in college. But he started answering that telephone and, you know, handing out fliers and got involved in process that he began to understand, hands on, so I'd say you know, there may be local political races and stuff around here that you can get the kids involved in, just incidental learning. You learn a lot just hanging out in these places. Like you did. 

01:29:25
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN, PH.D. Yeah, I think, um, just to one thought is to use, uh, I'll give you the fancy term but then the reality, I mean indigenous cultural artifacts, in other words, help the kids connect to hip hop music and other things that are political in nature, and there's quite a lot of it out there, um, to try to help them, you know, to learn about broader issues. I think that would be really useful. Um, you know, I think YouTube's a good thing, there's a lot of great stuff... 

01:29:55
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. Oh yeah! 

01:30:00
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN, PH.D. Lot of great concert footage from the 70s, by the way, so uh, (inaudible ) but that's, uh, there's a lot of good stuff there. So, um, yeah, I think there's some really important socially oriented artists who are speaking to people in a given community that I think can really speak transformative, help enhance their consciousness. 

01:30:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible) 

01:30:30
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. Mm. 

01:30:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) So, the question is what are you prepared to sacrifice in order to achieve the objective? I'd be interested in (inaudible ) sacrifice in order to advance (inaudible ). 

01:31:00
CONNIE S. CHAN, PH.D. Well, in my case it was tenure. I, when you're a young, you know, assistant professor and you spend six years trying to get tenure, I thought there's a change I won't get tenure because there were some dissenting views that said you know, that my work wasn't central, um, to psychology, but you know, I had enough support that I was able to get tenure. But you have to sacrifice, you know, that you might not fit in, um, in, in whatever job you have. So, it could be employment, it could be, um, it could be I guess, what's the word, acceptance from your mentors, um, some of your mentors, you know, I think Heather said they want to shape you kind of like them, or somebody said you want, and some of my mentors were disappointed that I didn't go into, um, their area, and I think you also have to sacrifice that sometimes, you know, you're not gonna be popular with, with some of your, um, colleagues and peers as well, because you take unpopular, you can take some unpopular stances, um, around things. I remember even, you know, with, with division 44, the society for, you know, lesbian, at that time it was lesbian and gay psychology, there was a big push about gay affirmative psychology and how important it was tom for everyone to come out that that was the most important thing, that you should, you know, everyone should come out and if you're a psychologist and you were working with a client who's questioning might be gay, you want to encourage them to come out, and I remember saying well, you know, whoa whoa whoa, culturally you might not be the best thing to come out. If you're an ethnic minority person, your support is your family and your community and you're not ready and you come out, you're gonna lose your, you know, cause they always say you come out, you find your community. I said you're going to lose your community. So, you know, it's not always, it's culturally valued, culturally bound to say everybody should come out. You have to look at the context, and I know many psychologists at that time, gay psychologists at that time say I was wrong. So, you know, you have to, you have to kind of have a tough skin, you have to like really push. 

01:33:05
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN, PH.D. Actually, can I just follow up on that, it's a quick question. Um, I think my experience is very similar, and I'm sure this is cognitively aware of it, that when I started to shift my focus from a traditional career development scholarship trajectory, to what I, I call it the psychology of working, which is very political, very social perspective, that critiques the traditional discourse in my field. Um, as I was (inaudible ) it came out in '06 I was aware that it might be offensive to some of my colleagues. I wasn't quite aware of how tough my skin needed to be, and maybe being naive was helpful because when I started to go to conferences (inaudible )one thing some of my colleagues (inaudible )they would sometimes take me on at workshops, um, sometimes in a very unpleasant way. And, uh, engage in a level of, to quote President Obama, um, it was okay to disagree, but sometimes they were disagreeable. So, I had to be comfortable with people being disagreeable toward me, and um, in one sense, one way I did that was I critiqued my own work that my earlier work, I'm not going to dismiss it, but it was very much part of the traditional discourse and, uh, I critiqued my own work when I gave public lectures, but I was aware that when I wrote The Psychology Of Working, I was going against the tradition that was rooted in this very building, the work of Super and the traditional career counseling world, uh, which I called elitist. So, I, um, did take some risk, but at that point, I mean to be perfectly honest, was already a full professor and had some of my own. So the risk wasn't as big a risk as, let's say, taking the risk when you're an assistant professor. Um, and I wish I could, I mean, the reality was I didn't think of assistant professor, so it wasn't like, um, I was trying to be protective, I just didn't have these ideas then. It took some evolution. But, I think the realities also, I picked up a lot of great new friends as well, and colleagues who welcomed what I was doing, but there was an element when you do this kind of work of when you buck up against the system, people are going to take it very personally, and some people have said to me, David, I take your critique personally. I said it wasn't meant to be personal, it's an intellectual enterprise and you need to learn that when you put ideas out there, to take feedback. But, some people have said I take what you say very personally, and have not been as friendly. So, that's why I don't get invitations like this. 

01:35:50
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. When I was worrying about that social change, I was maybe 29 years old, out of graduate school, and lived experience. Now, I said it at the beginning, that my mother raised these three children by herself, working two jobs, nurses aid, waitress on the weekends. So, I looked at myself and I said my god, I got PhD, I must have some ability. So, I can survive, if my mother could survive all that, the Great Depression with the bank in the 30s, raise those children, get us along, then I know I can survive. And then I'm looking at Tom Parham, when I came to this conclusion, Tom was a little boy growing up in South Central Alabama in 1965 I got this book, here, Rivers of Blood. The brothers tore up the community in LA for six days running, the biggest race riot in America in the promise land, which is California. LA burned down, 20 square miles of LA. Tom couldn't even come out of his house. I'm a young professor at Long Beach State and while they were interviewing professors, they forgot to interview anybody black to explain why these Negroes were burning the town down. You know, they called a white boy and asked him at UCLA, SC and so forth. On the fifth day or sixth day riot, CBS finally figured out they Hadn't interviewed any Negroes. So, they called all around the LA basin and found me. The president said yeah, we got that little Negro down there, he's a child psychologist and some of his kids is probably burning the place down. So, they came out to my house with them big old TV cameras to interview me, and I was trying, my last attempt to be a good scholar. I had written down employment figures, housing, education, I was trying to explain why these people were mad and upset. And they get that microphone in front of me, and I don't know to this day what (inaudible ) I just blew up. I mean, I went crazy. I just went crazy. I said for 400 years you mother fuckers have been fucking around, and I went off about it. My wife and my little children were standing there, they was crying, you know, daddy flipped out. So, that was on a Friday. Now, remember, I'm assistant professor, right, I'm on tenure track. And I said to myself you done lost your job. It was all over TV. So, sure enough Monday morning, the president of the campus had his secretary call me. I knew the call was coming. So, he said he wants to see me in his office at eight o'clock in the morning. So, I went in and I was all set to be fired, and the first thing I noticed was the man did not seem mad. And he said, his didn't say (inaudible ). He said I'm gonna tell you what we're gonna do. We're gonna clean this off next door where he was, and we're gonna redecorate it and we're going to put you in it and you will be the director of minority affairs. And you will have head start, elementary school, secondary, you will have a job core, and anything else that comes through here that looks like minorities, cause you the director of minority affairs, just like that. So, on Friday I was a child psychologist, on Monday and I'm gonna tell you this, you're all talking about this tenure. I have never been reviewed, Tommy knows that. They just accelerated me. I was never reviewed. Now, and the first article I wrote was in Ebony Magazine, that's not no publication. Hm? And they's gonna give me a $2000 review, I mean a $2000 increase by the time I was already full professor, and they was standing there in that review and the guy pulled the article out and said Ebony Magazine, he said, is this a peer review journal? And I said what did you say? What did you say, I looked right at him and said you know god damned well this is not no peer review journal. If you know that, why would you ask me that, I'll bust a cap in your god damned ass. So, then I was charged with, uh, unprofessional conduct. 

01:40:25
[laughter] 

01:40:30
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. You know, as I'm thinking about your question, um, by the time I left the prolonged torture of graduate school, I was not prepared to go somewhere else and be tortured. Um, that had been enough, um, and that I was writing checks for it every month, too. And, you know, I just rejected the idea of an academic career, cause I thought what, you know, that I know what I'm looking at there, um, and I think folks have to remember there are other places psychologists can work and do social justice work and in some ways, do it a hell of a lot easier than in academia where you have to worry about tenure and all that other nonsense. Um, my first decade of work as a psychologist was in public mental health. And you do make interventions in people's lives directly that are important, um, particularly for children, um, and it was just sort of as a fluke that I started writing things, um, and, and that sort of grew. So, by the time I was looking for academic jobs, it was already clear what I was doing. And they could take it or leave it. But it wasn't, but that wasn't sort of the Holy Grail of my professional life, that I've got to do this and now I've got to organize everything I'm gonna do or say around, well, how is that going to be received. At that juncture in my career, I wasn't going anyplace where that wasn't okay. 

01:42:00
[sil.] 

01:42:00
UNKNOWN I have a quick question. Thank you. Um, I wanted to know, for those who have spent a substantial amount of time in academia, if you could share with us your perceptions of the ways in which the politics has changed over the years, and what, uh, known academics or mid career academics like myself need to be aware of (inaudible ). 

01:42:30
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. I don't know that it has changed a great deal. I think it depends on where you are. You know, institutions are very different. Some, I mean, if you want to think of the workplace, you know, unless you own the workplace as a plantation, well, are the masters benevolent or malevolent? And you look for a place where they're gonna be more benevolent, um, but in some pla- in some academic institutions, they are still quite malevolent, um, some are affirming and supportive places to work. So... 

01:43:05
[sil.] 

01:43:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible) university and what you said really resonated with me in terms of working with the system and not letting the system... 

01:43:15
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. ...work you, right. 

01:43:20
UNKNOWN And what has happened (inaudible ) and especially youth, I don't think they give youth as much credit as they deserve, that, uh, there is a climate that know how to work the system so well how would you teach them that you work the system, but not in a way that you become the very thing that you're trying to (inaudible ). And so now, you become, you can become an oppressor in a way, or a person in power and you were repeating the cycle, um, of that which you're fighting against. Teaching people how to fight for social justice but to have, um, I guess control and a sense of containment. 

01:44:05
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. Well, I think one of the, sometimes what happens to people who are not used to having institutional power, is that you may get it and you don't even realize that you have it. So, there has to be a consciousness around the fact that you have it, to first then, start thinking about well, what are you doing with it? Um, and you know, certainly one of the there's certainly enough perils in academia, but one of the privileges is that you get to shape the discourse, and that whatever that is out there that they call the truth of whatever something is, that you get to shape that, and that you can bring those voices to the table, who are not there. And that, in terms of having power that you can use it that way, but often I think people are so used to not having it, and so used to having to prove themselves, that even when they no longer have to do that, it's not always so clear that you don't have to do it. And you know, it's it's difficult to kind of take stock of when you can say alright, it doesn't matter what you think of what I write, cause at this stage I can just do what I want to do. Um, and to think about whether or not you're recreating the thing that you've, you struggle against, um, certainly having, um, peers and people who you work with, who you have alliances with, who help to keep you honest about that, um, having connections with many of our colleagues who are not in academia, who are doing things in other places, who, so that you get a sense of what's going on and how you can use whatever power or influence it is you have to bear to bring those things to the fore. Um, sharing resources in academia for many people, um, I'm thinking particularly in terms of practitioners who are working in a lot of the places that, um, Joe has talked about. They have a lot that is important to say, but they don't have access to the resources with which to do it. Um, we can collaborate with people who do that work and find a way to get that into the discourse as well. So, but it, but you have to be aware that, that you have these privileges that once, you know, you've jumped through enough hurdles, you now have access and so, you have to think about what you're doing with that access. 

01:46:40
[sil.] 

01:46:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible) 

01:46:45
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. Try that. 

01:46:50
[sil.] 

01:46:50
UNKNOWN I want to thank you all for being here and sharing your, uh, wisdom and insights with us. Uh, earlier one of the panel members mentioned the fact that one way to possibly fight for social justice is to take away the unfair advantage that certain people have, and uh, I wonder if that logic might be challenged and, um, perhaps if another way to look at it is instead of taking away advantage that somebody else has, increase advantages to those who may not have that. I was wondering if perhaps, you guys may comment on that, the pros and cons of both, kind of, philosophies or both sides of that argument. 

01:47:35
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. Well, I think you have to be prepared for, you know, it's best if you sort of raise everybody up, that you're not taking something away from anybody else, but I think if you're talking about people who are used to having privilege, and then privilege is being shared, um, the perception is going to be that you're taking something away from that. And that they're going to respond in that way. I mean, if you, if you think about the, uh, the political struggle around same sex marriage, it's as if somehow if there is same sex marriage, it takes something away from heterosexual marriage. It, and it does not, but, but that's the perception. I have this thing, not because I was just lucky, but because I uniquely deserve it and you don't, and if you get it, it somehow takes something away from me. 

01:48:30
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN, PH.D. Yeah, I think I might have mentioned something about this. Um, I think there's a number of points here. One is in terms of, um, justice, when you're in situations for example, um, let's take New York City with Mayor de Blasio's idea of preschool, pre-preschool by increasing the taxes on people who make a half a million dollars or more. That's a sacrifice, but I think his view is it's a sacrifice that people can afford to make. Um, you know, other things like paying higher taxes to invest more in infrastructure, so I'm looking at this global contributions people need to make, then as individual contributions of people being willing to give up their privilege, you know, white male privilege or other sorts of privilege. So, um, I think that, um, there's more than enough resources in this country for there to be much less poverty if any, more work for people, and it will, it will involve some sacrifice in my opinion. 

01:49:30
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. Well, let me take the other half of that, and that is people function under self-interest, alright. So, rather than taking away from people, we have to keep trying to find a way to convince them that we can enrich the whole process for everybody. Let me give an example. I grew up during World War II, the boys went off to fight the war, and then they came home in the mid 40s. Then they had babies, right, so-called, what do you call it, the war generation? 

01:50:05
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN, PH.D. Baby Boomers. 

01:50:05
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. Baby Boomers. Baby Boomers was born, right? White folks was born, right? And they didn't have enough colleges in California for these baby boomers. So, what did they do? They never said we're going to take something away from some of ya'll. They built more colleges, three branches of the University of California, five of the Cal State system. They built brand new branches so everybody could go to college. And the other piece of the self-interest was not only were they rewarding these veterans who had fought the war, but California was becoming the biggest state in the union and you need educated young people to run a giant economy. But nobody complained because everybody got something out of the deal. So, what we're trying to say is we're not trying to take something away from America, with the social justice, we're trying to enrich America. 

01:51:00
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. But in doing that, we also need to talk about how, you know, when you're talking about centers of great wealth, um, that wealth was built on tax supported initiatives. That didn't just come about because people went out and dug ditches and made millions of dollars. That's not how people developed great wealth anymore. And so, they didn't just get it by themselves. That's not how wealth was developed, and that needs to be materialized, that this notion of, you know, you're taking away something from me that I got all by myself, well you didn't get it all by yourself. A lot of those people who deserve help, their taxes supported whatever it is you were doing. So... 

01:51:45
UNKNOWN I'd like to mention gate keepers. I finished with a degree in psychology but, uh, you know, I worked in, there are other jobs other than here in academia. You can work, uh, in instructional television, uh, research in the structure of television. As such, I, uh, we're builders, we're builders, we're gonna get somewhere. I grew up in north east Louisiana community that nurtured its students. It was a black community that nurtured its students, uh, and imbued us with the responsibility to get out there and help those who pushed us up, those who supported us, who nurtured us. So, I came here with all that in mind. Um, how I got, I uh, received, I worked hard, got merit raises for being kind of pioneer in the work that I was doing in research in instructional television. And, uh, when I realized I wasn't going anywhere, and my director saw it too, he said you know, you're gonna price yourself out of your category. And I had to remind him that he could promote me. And he did, it was bottom level of the next level, but I did get a promotion. Uh, and it's been like that. In my professional career, I have been laid off eight times because I was always the, the last hired, the first fired. So, um, I'd like to make, young people aware of gate keepers. You can get your beautiful degree and you can put it on your wall, but be careful because the human resources departments some are not ready, yet. However, there, there is hope and it is that, um, you know, take notes be very observant, and there's litigation. And I think that moves people. Thank you. 

01:54:10
[applause] 

01:54:15
[sil.] 

01:54:15
UNKNOWN Um, my question is about finding voice and finding contradictions to silence, particularly as students and early career professionals who find ourselves, um, in organizations whose very values are antithetical or antagonistic to social, uh, social justice. Um, I'm currently on internship, and I find that my peers who are trained, um, as psychologists, are the only ones in the board who are really struggling with identity, cause we find that, you know, we come from our institutions the way everyone is fluent about oppression and social justice, but then end up in this setting where they think you're talking Greek and, you know, we think we've honed our identities in a particular way, and then we're now struggling where we're, like silenced and... So, I was just wondering whether you have any thoughts or advice about that. 

01:55:20
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. Well, I think you have to consider the nature of the institution that you're going to, a priority, and what that means in terms of what kinds of challenges you're gonna face. But also, how you can use the institution's rules to get what you want even if it's not overt, you know. The, uh, it, the issue is using whatever privilege access you have you know, to advance whatever your goals are. Um, I'm reminded, you know, during the, during the Holocaust, there were, uh, Nazi soldiers who helped Jews escape, and they used their position as soldiers to do that. So, you can be in unjust institutions and use their agenda against them or use, figure out how to use it in ways that advances whatever your goals are. It's better to not be in those institutions if you can. But then, if none of us are ever in those places they'll never change. 

01:56:20
HEATHER E. BULLOCK, PH.D. I would just also suggest that there could be power in numbers. If there are, um, others who feel the same way that you do, working together for some kind of change, not, maybe trying to do it all on your own, but working with others in the same situation, and try to find some allies in that institution. It's a hard situation. 

01:56:45
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:56:45
UNKNOWN Good morning. First of all, thank you so much for all you have shared with us today and paving the path that we hope to one day follow. Um, as a man of color, it's become painfully obvious to see that we're a minority in academia both in the seats as a student and as professors. Um, I'm assuming as faculty, eventually that will be the case as well. So, it's a two part question. The first one being working with youth, how do we prepare them to come and face this, telling them a false idea. I mean, once you get there, you might be the only kid of color sitting in that classroom. Um, and secondly, uh, does it ever go away? I mean, eventually once you become a professor, they may not be thinking that, and I mean, how do I motivate them while I'm still feeling this way today? So... 

01:57:40
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. Well, how is that different than any other major American institution? And, like, in major law firms who, you may well be the only person of color in the business, um, at the level of CEOs you may be the only one. Um, you know, there, there are, there is still a ceiling on opportunities that allow people of color to rise to a certain level. And that, that's gonna be part of the reality if you're successful. So, but that's not an end in and of itself. 

01:58:20
CONNIE S. CHAN, PH.D. You know, I think it's worse if you're a woman because the in terms of the hierarchy, you know, there is still less access for women in leadership, in particular, the glass ceiling is very much, you know, in place for women in terms of, um, in leadership. Particularly academic leadership, I think leadership in general, there is a big leadership gap where women are not allowed and not, not viewed as leaders, and in a profession like psychology, which is so, you know, has so many women you know, we really have to focus on that. 

01:59:00
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. So, I think that, what's your first name again? 

01:59:00
UNKNOWN Ryan. 

01:59:05
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. Now, I want you to think of success in two tiers, the first tier is you have to get the paperwork. Okay, that's the first tier, you're going to graduate school and do whatever you're doing med school, law school, you have to get through that. And live to fight another day. Now, the next tier, and this is where rubber meets the road is, you have to decide, then, after you finish that education, whether you want to work for social change or not. Cause if you don't work for social change than it will stay the same. But if you're a person of color then there's the two tiers, first you got to get your paperwork, get somebody sign off, then you've got to decide do you want to work for social change. And so, that the next generation won't have to go through what you did. 

02:00:05
MARIE L. MIVILLE, PH.D. Okay, thank you everyone, thanks to our panel. Please join me in giving them a round of applause. 

02:00:10
[applause] 

02:00:20
MARIE L. MIVILLE, PH.D. And so, we're going to continue with, uh, a new tradition we began last year and, um, you know, really thinking of the comments that were just made about what we need to think about passing on to the next generation. So, we have, um, a ceremony we'd like to engage in, and invite some students to come up from the audience and we have it's simple, um, maybe even a little obvious. We have some candles that we want to light and have each of our panelists pass on to the students, and so I'd like to ask the students come on up. 

02:01:00
[sil.] 

02:01:05
MARIE L. MIVILLE, PH.D. And this is just a way of celebrating and symbolizing the work that, um, many of us do and hopefully many of you will come to do, too. 

02:01:20
[sil.] 

02:03:05
ANGELA D. FERGUSON, PH.D. Interestingly enough, I met Kareen about four years ago, three, five years ago. Um, and every time I come here, I see her as she progresses each time, and I'm always happy to see her. Um, and what I a mentor told me when I was first really, and I really didn't understand it at the time, but that mentor told me that tenacity is the key to success, and that your challenge today is your success tomorrow. 

02:03:40
[applause] 

02:03:45
[sil.] 

02:03:55
BEVERLY GREENE, PH.D. Um, I guess I would share some of the wisdom that was shared with me, um, from my elders, and that is, um, this started long before you, it will continue well after you're gone. You do what you can while you're here. 

02:04:15
[applause] 

02:04:20
[sil.] 

02:04:25
CONNIE S. CHAN, PH.D. So, I'll share some of the things that were shared with me as well, and what is really, you have to not be afraid to fail, that often takes many tries before you succeed, but each time you're moving forward, you're doing better, and you have to be resilient and believe in yourself, and I know you can do it. 

02:04:45
[applause] 

02:04:50
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. I would say to keep the faith, keep on keeping on, fight the good fight and live to fight another day. 

02:05:05
[applause] 

02:05:05
HEATHER E. BULLOCK, PH.D. Follow your passions, believe in yourself, you can change the world. 

02:05:15
[applause] 

02:05:20
DAVID L. BLUSTEIN, PH.D. I would say, uh, in the words of my mother, which is, um, you can't make peace between two walls, so always keep yourself open, keep your heart open, because the work is going to involve you as well as others. 

02:05:35
[applause] 

02:05:40
MARIE L. MIVILLE, PH.D. Thank you. And I'd like to call Thomas to the stage to say some closing words for us. By the way, Thomas Parham for those of you who don't know. 

02:05:55
[applause] 

02:05:55
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. Tell them how long, not long, Tom. 

02:06:00
THOMAS PARHAM How long, not long, cause no lie can live forever, alright. Um, what an incredible morning we've had. I think one more time, we want to celebrate both our elders and our young students. Give it up for them please. 

02:06:20
[applause] 

02:06:20
THOMAS PARHAM While you're standing, let's keep on standing. Everybody grab somebody, everybody grab somebody, touch somebody. If you got a cold, grab a elbow, do something, touch somebody. 

02:06:45
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. It's gonna get warm now. 

02:06:45
THOMAS PARHAM One of the things that is special about this space we call the winter roundtable, in the vision of Sam Johnson, is that it was not meant to be like APA, where the folk kind of walk around in there, you know, glory meritocracy and it's hard to touch them and connect to them. This is a place where folk connect. That's the culture of this institution. So, we've now instituted ritual. Ritual always helps to center our consciousness on the task at hand. The task this morning is to simply be silent as we listen to the wisdom of the elders, but also be able to translate that wisdom into strategies that will allow us to be the social justice advocates that we want to be. So, we close with a piece of, of prose from Dr. William Novice, it's called standing. Much of what goes misunderstood, friends, in our cultural traditions, occurs because of our inability to understand. So, as we do this, please appreciate the symbolism connected to us, as we just connect with somebody and close our eyes, truly in the flow of human development. Our community is social justice advocates, is a river, and we who call ourselves people of advocacy are standing deep in its waters, and with amazing grace, we are beginning to recognize the ancient flow of human wisdom given to us by these elders, as well as the indelible marks of human development. The river of our community of social justice speaks to and through us. Men and women, people of justice, we must listen to the laughter and the pain, and feel the sorrow and the strength of our river. Social justice advocates, we are standing in the river, alone we shall be swept away by its current, but united, we can know the many rivers to cross. Individually, we shall drown in its depths, but combined, the rivers shall guide us to the high road. Singularly, we are halted by its torrid banks, but as one, the river shall carry us to a distant place. As one people, the river shall return us to the source. Social justice advocates, we are standing in the river, even as we are transformed and transforming. Let us also remember the wisdom of the elder, I quote my mentor, our senior elder here, Dr. Joe White. It's hard to be a social justice advocate if you're always seeking validation from those who would oppress you. You cannot seek validation from your oppressor. It's hard to be a social justice advocate if you're going to institutions and you haven't learned to assess what an institution will tolerate. It's hard to be a social justice advocate if you don't develop the courage to be able to do the right thing even in the face of adversity. Our challenge is to find hope in the midst of despair, courage in the face of fear, stability when that roller coaster rides seems out of control. We are standing in this water, but we are transformed and transforming. With that, we thank you for being with us this morning. One more time for our elders! 

02:11:00
JOSEPH L. WHITE, PH.D. Give it up, give it up.
