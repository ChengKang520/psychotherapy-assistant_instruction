DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remembering the importance of creating new positive habits and foundation to help you in your trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday building the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is Replaying the Positive. Most of us spend far too much time immersed in replaying the fearful moments of our past or future worries. This is true, even when you know everything you need to know about the past that had made time to prepare plans for the future. Replaying the positive exercise. We all have moments in life which represent the ideal calm, best moments where we felt safe, relaxed, happy had planned at ease. The task in this exercise is to allow yourself to recall a moment like that as vividly as possible and to notice how this makes you feel. It's the opposite of what we generally do, portraying fearful things from the past and worries about the future. Well, practicing the positive resets our mind and focuses our attention on a state of wellbeing. This helps us to let go and with that we are better able to manage the demands of life. If we are in constant distress, it's hard to deal with one more thing. Here if we take a few moments to practice replaying the positive, it sets the tone for a stable and calm base who would better able to handle life, losses and daily upsets. Let's practice together. Right now, one, picture in your own minds eye, in your imagination, a place where you've been to in the past, or one from your imagination. This is the place where you felt most calm and at rest, relieved of any of your worries or fears. Maybe a place where you were during a vacation or at an earlier stage in your life. Take a moment to take that picture where, when that would be. If you don't have a place in your mind, then picture what an ideal place of calm, safety and comfort might feel like or look like for you. Two, most people find it easier to do this with their eyes closed, this in helps to open up your imagination. Three, use your imagination now to see what you would see, you are unique here, feel what you would feel, sense what you would sense in that calm and comfortable place. Just imagine that for a moment. Just imagine that. Imagine that you are there right now. Notice what your body and mind feels like when you use your imagination in this way to picture a safe and comfortable place. Don't worry if you are not able to fully experience it in this moment, but recognize that with time and practice you'll be able to picture a place associated with safety, calm and comfort. Again, allow yourself to replay that moment of safety, comfort and calm, wherever it was, by the beach, in a quite park setting, in a comfortable room in your home, relaxing in a favorite neighborhood. Wherever it is, allow yourself to picture everything as vividly as possible, and do that now. Practice this again, throughout your day, whenever you need to recapture feelings of comfort and calm. Use your mind to help harness your imagination, to remember comforting time and replay the positive. Take the time right now to form a new healthy practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky, from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
