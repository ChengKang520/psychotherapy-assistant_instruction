RICH SIMON Welcome everyone, my name is Rich Simon editor of Psychotherapy Networker. And I'd like to welcome you to this Webcasts series, Who's Afraid of Couples Therapy. This, this uh, series was uh, initiated really by our guests uh, for this installment of Who's Afraid of Couples Therapy. In a moment you'll hear how this unfolded. But basically what we're trying to address in this series is an aspect of uh, therapeutic practice and works with couples that often is not addressed in our trainings and workshops. Often they're very focused on models and theories. And less attention is paid to the actual craft of working with couples, being in the room and particularly the emotional challenge of sitting with couples who where there maybe conflict, where there may be a whole set of issues that people find very difficult to discuss. Where the therapist is outnumbered uh, unlike the individual therapy, typical individual therapy situation. And so, we're, over these next week's we're gonna be addressing uh, the issues that are particularly challenging in working with couples. Uh, but for this uh, very first interview we'd like to uh, welcome the um, the co-authors in the cover story in this uh, in the November, December issue of the Networker. I hope you can see this, Who's Afraid of Couples Therapy. And it's my great pleasure to uh, welcome Ellyn Bader and Pete Pearson for uh, to uh, this Networker Website. Hey folks, how are ya? 

00:02:00
ELLYN BADER Hey Rich. 

00:02:00
PETER PEARSON Doing well, good to be here! 

00:02:05
RICH SIMON All right, good. 

00:02:05
ELLYN BADER Looking forward to assimilating Rich Simon interview. 

00:02:05
RICH SIMON All right, well I'm looking forward to assimilating Ellyn Bader and Peter Pearson interview. So let's us uh, this started, this whole idea. It's all your, your fault. You guys contacted the Networker it seemed like about a year and a half ago because you, you had, had a particular concern about a, a direction of practice that you thought was not good for the field. So can ya, let's start off, tell, tell uh, tell folks how this started and what the background for this whole issue was from your point of view. 

00:02:35
ELLYN BADER Uh, I think the main thing when we first contacted you Rich was concern about the ways that individuals therapy and sometimes individual therapist inadvertently were destabilizing marriages. And without intending to but sometimes having an actually destructive effect on marriage because when you're seeing a person individually it is so easy to align with their complaints and so difficult simultaneously to see how they're interacting with their partner. 

00:03:05
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. And so um, so it were a field and no one knows there were as far as I know uh, and when we send out our mailings and when we spam therapist around the country and the world uh, with our various messages it is seems that there is somewhere between oh, over 600 thousand mental health professionals in, in the United States and probably more. Um, and one wonders how many of those folks are actually trained in doing couples work. Do you, you have any notion of that? 

00:03:45
PETER PEARSON Well if you look at graduate school, the training is pretty meager. Most therapist get one maybe two classes in couples therapy and that's about it. 

00:03:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:03:55
PETER PEARSON And now go forth, throw yourself into the fray. 

00:04:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:04:00
PETER PEARSON Be confident, be calm, and give directions. It's, it's like flying a helicopter into a hurricane and what you have is like 20 minutes behind the joystick. 

00:04:10
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:04:10
ELLYN BADER You know, what's interesting Rich, is when we started uh, couples therapy wasn't a specialty at all. And there wasn't even a degree really in martial therapy. Now you have a lot of programs in marriage and family therapy but still as Pete said, most of them don't have sufficient ways for therapist to get into the trenches and have the experience of working with enough couples to be really competent in terms of doing the work. 

00:04:35
PETER PEARSON Even more importantly uh, the, in graduate school you don't have an opportunity to see couples and then get immediate feedback for what to do or what not to do. And if that doesn't create anxiety when you're confronted with your first really fighting couple, they don't want to listen to each other, they don't listen to you. Oh. No wonder therapist are reluctant to see couples. 

00:05:00
RICH SIMON Well, on the other piece of it and, and I think you guys make it uh, really make this point in your, in your piece is that in some ways if, if one thinks of uh, certain traditional modes of psychotherapy they're an extension of something most of us have some experience with in life. We're good listeners, we're empathic people, we know how to uh, uh, make somebody feel comfortable in relationship. That's why we become therapist in the first place. 

00:05:30
ELLYN BADER We want to help. 

00:05:30
RICH SIMON We want to be helpful. All those things, you know. Certainly that's, that's a grand thing about our, our, our field and why so many of us are drawn into it. It really is hard to imagine that there is such a thing as a natural couples therapist. We don't, in life, I don't know, maybe there's some kind of families where people grow up in this and they, they start doing couples therapy with their parents or however they do it early in life. But most of us start off and it's, it's, a lot of it is really unlearning a lot of the normal rules of everyday interaction. Um, and so part of, and I would imagine as, as, and you guys have been doing your, your trainings for 25 years. So when people come in uh, what's your, your typical experience, they, they have some uh, uh, in training in individual therapy or some natural aptitude for it. What's the, what's the challenge here? Turning somebody who might be a excellent patient, warm, empathic, uh, positive unconditionally positive regarding individual therapist, that doesn't translate necessarily to an effective couples therapist. What's missing? What is it that you guys find yourselves working on um, more than any, any other attributes in turning, in terms of helping people be competent in working with couples? 

00:06:55
PETER PEARSON Well, we have so many answers to that question, it's unbelievable. 

00:07:00
RICH SIMON All right, just what, whatever comes to mind. We'll get to them all. 

00:07:05
ELLYN BADER So, I'll start and then. I think one of the things is in order to work with couples effectively you've got to be very directive. And particularly extremely directive in the early sessions. 

00:07:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:07:15
ELLYN BADER And you know, most people in their training with individual clients are trained how to listen, ask questions, illicit what the problem is, take your time listening from the client what's going on. 

00:07:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:07:30
ELLYN BADER And most times00:07:35] when couples come in they're in crisis, there may be they're high volatility or extreme disengagement. 

00:07:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:07:45
ELLYN BADER And you, you can't be passive or quiet when you're working with a couple like that. 

00:07:50
PETER PEARSON Or if you start to if you have a really high volatile couple and you start to become understanding, empathic and patient with one of the partners. 

00:07:55
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:07:55
PETER PEARSON The other person and, and maybe the therapist is thinking, gosh, I am modeling what I would like them the partner to do. Well what the partner is thinking about the therapist is, you're getting snowed. 

00:08:10
RICH SIMON Yep, right. 

00:08:10
ELLYN BADER Or you're siding with the other person. 

00:08:10
PETER PEARSON Yeah. 

00:08:10
ELLYN BADER I'm not gonna come back if you keep siding with them. 

00:08:15
RICH SIMON So. 

00:08:15
PETER PEARSON So all the wonderful things we, we which are good skills, even in couples therapy. They are good skills to have. The problem is when you start to rely on them predominantly and go into exploring, understanding, interpreting. And with really high conflict couples for example they're not really interested in exploring why I do what I do. They're interested in the other person exploring why they do what they do so that they will make the shift. That's a huge problem in working with couples. 

00:08:50
RICH SIMON Okay. So in that, in these uh, this early stage you're, you're part of what you're doing is uh, I, is, is helping people unlearn some of the things they may have learned in their more traditional individual therapy training. 

00:09:05
ELLYN BADER Yeah, can I mention one more? 

00:09:10
RICH SIMON Go ahead. 

00:09:10
ELLYN BADER Uh, uh, a big unlearning and therapist say this to me all the time. A big unlearning is not always following up on nonverbal cues. When you're working with an individual and you see somebody sigh or. 

00:09:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:09:25
ELLYN BADER Or they, they a big deep breath. 

00:09:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:09:25
ELLYN BADER You know, you go what's going on with you? 

00:09:30
PETER PEARSON Yeah. 

00:09:30
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:09:30
ELLYN BADER And. 

00:09:30
PETER PEARSON Or they roll their eyes. Now a lot of times you do not want to say, "What was that eye roll about?", because what you will get now is an onslaught of blame. And now you got a bigger mess. 

00:09:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. So, what you're doing in your couples session and depending on your, your model of couples therapy. Uh, uh, there are variations on this. But in effect, you're creating a kind of culture in that room, in, which is uh, uh, distinct from the kind of ordinary conversational culture that most of us inhabit. And certainly it's quite distinct from the kind of culture that um, the, this couple has created for themselves in, in their interaction at home. Which is the reason they're, they're coming in. So in terms of the kind of uh, how do you think about that? What is it that you're trying to create in that room? You talked a moment ago about this need to be directive and some of the things you don't do. What, in that initial stage the, the couple, whatever the couple happens to be, you, you often don't have a real sense to why they're coming there. What is it you're trying to establish early on in those first few moments of uh, the couple coming in and uh, the first interview with you? What's important for you from, from the viewpoint of uh, of you how you see the skills of couples therapy and that sense of kind of culture you're trying to create? 

00:10:55
ELLYN BADER We'll answer that but that's usually a three hour workshop that I give, so. 

00:11:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:11:00
ELLYN BADER I might uh, we, we can just call, yeah often called getting off to a powerful start. 

00:11:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:11:05
ELLYN BADER But so, so, I mean a couple of. 

00:11:10
RICH SIMON I'm gonna take that. Sounds like a good workshop, I like it. Okay. 

00:11:15
ELLYN BADER Uh, do you want to try. 

00:11:15
PETER PEARSON Yeah, **. The first thing after you, you get some sense of why they're there. 

00:11:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:11:20
PETER PEARSON And after you get a sense of why they're there I think it's so important to start instead of tackling a problems and jumping in. Again, with really high distress couples what they want to do is start solving the problems right now because they're in so much pain, they're in so much distress, there's so much anguish that they want to get relief by solving the problems. And if you jump too fast with people with really complex embedded struggles you're just gonna make a mess of it. So what we do is we start changing first their attitude for a change. And until you change their attitude about what it means to change you're gonna always as therapist be reacting to the intensity of the problem that they're discussing. 

00:12:00
RICH SIMON Mmm, Mm-hmm, okay. So their attitude towards change, unpack that a little bit uh, for me. 

00:12:05
PETER PEARSON Well, the first thing when a couple comes in what we do, we say go to our website download a document called, "How to get the most out of couples therapy?" And I, we'll say this is what we'll give you uh, a sample of uh, how we think about change, how we think about working with couples, what you can expect from us and indeed what we'll expect from you. Because there are. 

00:12:30
RICH SIMON (inaudible ) this is before the first session? So you're already. 

00:12:35
PETER PEARSON Before the third sessions, so they read it before they come in. 

00:12:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:12:35
ELLYN BADER And we actually, we actually encourage therapist to write one of those for themselves and sometimes in our training groups we will work with them on writing their own documents. But part of that document is designed to create individual accountability and the awareness on the part of each person that they're gonna work, and that there'll be process. That it's not, we're not gonna be the magicians. 

00:13:00
PETER PEARSON So one of the first questions we ask when they come in is, did you read the document. Probably 90% of the time they say yes. 

00:13:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:13:05
PETER PEARSON And I'll say what did you get out of it. And they say, "Well, that if we're gonna be an effective we've got to look at ourselves first." And I'll say, "You just got the message. Congratulations! You got it." And they'll remember that for about 10 minutes. 

00:13:20
RICH SIMON Okay, all right. 

00:13:20
PETER PEARSON But it's a start. 

00:13:20
RICH SIMON Well, that's interesting. So, that this whole business of building a culture doesn't it starts mu-, earlier than this, the actual moment they come into the uh, the session. 

00:13:30
PETER PEARSON Exactly. 

00:13:30
RICH SIMON So you're building. 

00:13:30
ELLYN BADER It starts, it starts on the telephone. Not only with the recommendation to read the article. 

00:13:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:13:35
ELLYN BADER But sometimes we'll give then specific questions to bring in answers to as well. 

00:13:40
PETER PEARSON So what we don't want them to do is start rehearsing the bad behavior stories of their partner. 

00:13:45
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:13:50
PETER PEARSON And get those really polished before they come in so we know who the bad guy really is. 

00:13:55
RICH SIMON So what kind of. 

00:13:55
PETER PEARSON We want to interrupt that pattern. 

00:13:55
RICH SIMON What kind of, you say you have questions for folks before they even come in. So what's, what are you thinking about there? 

00:14:00
ELLYN BADER So I mean, I because I'm talking to the couple on the phone I fine tune them to their situation. But for example if a couple comes in and they're wanting to make a decision, should we get married, should we have kids, uh, should we break up. 

00:14:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:14:15
ELLYN BADER Then the question, the questions would be uh, what are you thinking we'll need to learn or understand to make that decision. What might you need to change about yourself in order to make that decision? 

00:14:30
PETER PEARSON In order to get clarity. 

00:14:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:14:30
ELLYN BADER If they're, if, if it's clear on the phone that they're very fighting, volatile couple I might ask somebody to answer the uh, what are the traits you think are important for you to develop in order to become more effective partner. 

00:14:45
RICH SIMON So. 

00:14:45
PETER PEARSON We just get them to reflect on it. 

00:14:45
RICH SIMON Okay, so you're, you're building responsibility, responsibility for self, you're trying to defocus on changing the partner from before they even step into the room. And so, um, into, in a first session, and we're gonna uh, in a few moments we're gonna talk about to classic patterns that, different ends of the spectrum on the volatility scale. We're gonna talk specifically about that. But in your notion of uh, a first session, I think most couples therapist agree that the first session of couples therapy has an importance that is uh, uh, even more so than a first individual therapy session where you're maybe taking your time, you're establishing repoire. It's more like a date, or a first meeting between individuals. It's more of a continuation of um, like something we, most of us experience in our lives most of the time. In that first session with a couple, and this is uh, cross and there'll be all kinds of individual uh, variations on it. What's your hope at the end of a first session with a couple, what, what is, what is it that you're, you would have hoped would be established? What do you, what are you trying to accomplish uh, from in, in your work with them? 

00:16:00
ELLYN BADER So let me say one thing and I think Pete will add. But um, we don't, we do double sessions for first sessions. 

00:16:10
PETER PEARSON Every first session is two hours. 

00:16:10
RICH SIMON Okay, right. 

00:16:10
PETER PEARSON One hour is not enough. You would not see an individual for 25 minutes. 

00:16:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:16:15
PETER PEARSON In that initial session. Uh, and then hope that you can create hope, giving understanding of what the problem is and say here's how we might approach it. You can't do that very well in 25 minutes. When you have two people and see them for an hour it just gets magnified. 

00:16:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:16:35
ELLYN BADER So, uh, a big hope, a big hope that I have out of the first session is that by, by the time they leave they have an experience of themselves being different with each other than they ever are at home. So there is something that is created in that first session, in the interaction between them or with me or in the description of what creates the pain. But that they have a new awareness about themselves and each other. 

00:17:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:17:00
PETER PEARSON The, what I would want to do is help them connect dots between here's your struggle today and here's from the past, earlier life experiences that contribute to your problems, challenges today. And here's why you guys struggle with what you want to create in the future. 

00:17:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:17:15
RICH SIMON And so I connect those dots. Teach them about the emotional brain which is, which tends depersonalize it. That they're really reacting from a store house of misery, angst, and anguish. When they trigger each other, they're not mean because they want to. When they learn about the emotional brain it tends to depersonalize and gives them a better understanding. 

00:17:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:17:40
PETER PEARSON Then the last chunk, not always but often in the last chunk, when they say, we just can't communicate. I will give them a process that they can experience about 5 or 10 minutes of talking about a really tough problem in a way where they will end up sounding like they're professional communicators. 

00:18:00
ELLYN BADER And have a different experience with themselves. 

00:18:00
PETER PEARSON With a totally different experience of how they can talk about things. The key is I think, is to change how they talk about things rather than how, rather than trying to tackle the problem directly. 

00:18:15
RICH SIMON It's a process. And so in that way of this we can I know we can spend a whole time talking about it, but in terms of that exercise and that uh, giving them a way of talking about changing their process by which they talk about things. What's, what's the essence of, of that exercise? What's the essence of the? 

00:18:35
PETER PEARSON Uh, here, here are the guidelines for the exercise. First of all, I say you guys aren't ready to solve problems yet because you haven't changed how you talk about them. If you change how you talk about your problems the solutions can be much more organic and natural. So I will give you a way to talk about the problems. And the first thing I need, and this is crucial for, for especially high conflict, severe distress couples, is you got to get permission from them to coach them. The, the thing that goes wrong in working with distress couples is that the therapist doesn't have permission. Which up front. 

00:19:15
RICH SIMON Mmm, yeah. 

00:19:15
PETER PEARSON Uh, and so we assume they're ready and eager to be coached they're not. 

00:19:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:19:20
PETER PEARSON Because when you intervene and try to help one or the other without that permission the couple will, one partner will say, "Why you picking on me? Why do I have to be the one who changes? Why can't they go first? So by permission I'll say, "Look I need permission to coach you guys, otherwise when I jump in to help you communicate better you will feel or part of each of you will feel a lot of shame or blame." Because. 

00:19:45
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:19:45
PETER PEARSON You've had a belly full in your life. 

00:19:45
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:19:45
PETER PEARSON That's not my intent. So, just in case you feel like, you know, I'm picking on you, well the spotlight is on you. I gotta start with somebody, it's random. 

00:20:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:20:00
PETER PEARSON Then I say, "Okay, now, now that we've", and that really is true. That you got to get that permission. Then the second thing is, I'm gonna give you a process right now for the next 5 or 10 minutes if you follow this process you are going to start communicating like you've been in therapy for a year. 

00:20:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:20:15
PETER PEARSON Here's what we're gonna do. 

00:20:20
RICH SIMON That installs hope. I, I like, okay. Do tell. 

00:20:25
PETER PEARSON And I'll say, you know, when you guys were fighting about da-da-da, a little bit ago. You were talking about da-da-da. And you haven't, you haven't had a descent discussion over this in years. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So we identify the topic. I'll say here's the topic. Now here's what I want you guys to do. We have the topic the next thing I want you to do is each of you say to the other one, my intention for discussing this topic is. 

00:20:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Okay 

00:20:50
PETER PEARSON You have to declare the intention or the reason why you want to talk about this. Otherwise it's like you just jump in a car with your partner and you start driving and you don't tell a partner of where you want to go, how long it's gonna take, how you know when you're gonna be there or anything. 

00:21:05
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:21:05
PETER PEARSON So tell your partner your intention, you want to be understood, you want to ventilate, you want empathy, you want to figure out why you react the way they do. You want a solution. Tell them your intent up front coolly. 

00:21:15
ELLYN BADER And get, and get it clear. You want clear. 

00:21:20
PETER PEARSON And get it really clear. 

00:21:20
RICH SIMON Clear. 

00:21:20
PETER PEARSON Then the next thing, and this is crucial. 

00:21:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:21:20
PETER PEARSON Because this will be changing the process and everything we do in here for the next few weeks will focus on this. And I give them an index card. Right down the topic, write down your intention, now this is crucial if you're coming from your higher self how do you aspire to be if you were a good communicator, how would you talk to you partner. And then they'll say, what do you mean? I'll say, would you like to be open? Would you like to curious, understanding, empathic, nondefensive? How would you like to be when you talk about this with your partner? 

00:21:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:21:55
PETER PEARSON So they, and I have them write that down on their index card. 

00:21:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:22:00
ELLYN BADER And have them, have them claim at least three or four things that they intend to do in the next 10 or 15 minutes. 

00:22:05
PETER PEARSON How they inspire to be. And then I'll say, here comes the killer one. You guys now if you do this you'll be expert communicators in a few minutes. 

00:22:10
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:22:10
PETER PEARSON How do you want your partner to feel when the discussion is over? 

00:22:15
RICH SIMON Oh boy! That's a, that's a. 

00:22:20
PETER PEARSON Cuz see, cuz see, I'll say now here's why, here's why I ask that question. 

00:22:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:22:20
PETER PEARSON When you are coming from your emotional brain it's all about getting, it's about getting your partner to do something different, be different, and say something different. Stop doing this, start doing that or do this more. It's all about getting. This structure is about understanding and giving. It totally changes. 

00:22:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:22:40
PETER PEARSON The frame for how you discuss, so you write that down. So they write down on an index card. And I'll say now keep this card in front of you. And keep looking at it. And if you start to stray from your own guidelines, I'll bring you back. How would that be if you start to stray? Okay, okay, okay. Now I got permission. 

00:22:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:22:55
PETER PEARSON And when you guys are really going well I'll say, wait, pause what you just said was beautiful, it was wonderful, and here's why. You just created a bridge, a connection, an understanding. It was a great question. So I will if you stray I will bring you back. When you say things that are really good I will underline it and reinforce it. Otherwise it might just go over your head. And then I'll say, okay now you guys start talking. And probably 80% of the couples that I see when I do this and this is either in the first or second session for the next 5 or 10 minutes with just minimal coaching from me, they start sounding like they are expert communicators. 

00:23:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:23:35
PETER PEARSON They're following their guidelines, not mine, their own. And they are talking about how to be. And I say we're not looking for a solution here. 

00:23:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:23:45
PETER PEARSON So, forget trying to solve it. We're just changing the way you talk about it and that's what creates success. 

00:23:50
RICH SIMON Wow. 

00:23:50
PETER PEARSON And it's amazing how often, how frequent they jump in and start. And right off the bat in the first session, second session a little, is the, the latest I do this. And they start really starting to experience, oh wow, that was really cool. 

00:24:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:24:05
PETER PEARSON That was really. 

00:24:05
RICH SIMON So that's the shift. 

00:24:05
PETER PEARSON Okay. 

00:24:10
RICH SIMON Experience you were talking about Ellyn? 

00:24:10
PETER PEARSON Yeah. 

00:24:10
RICH SIMON So. 

00:24:10
ELLYN BADER Yeah, and when they have a memory of the first session they have a memory of having felt that way or been that way, rather than what's typical in a lot of first sessions. Particularly with trainees who are knew in thera-, uh, uh, becoming couples therapists is the session gets out of control by the end the session. 

00:24:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:24:25
ELLYN BADER People leave feeling worse. 

00:24:30
RICH SIMON So you have a structure, you have an agenda, a process agenda and you. 

00:24:35
PETER PEARSON Yes. 

00:24:35
RICH SIMON And, and, and this idea, this alternative experience is really high on your list of, by the end of that first session they, they know, they have some take of what it's like to communicate in this very different style. 

00:24:45
PETER PEARSON See what you just said right there, Rich, which is so crucial. We have an agenda which is not appropriate for an individual. 

00:24:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:24:55
PETER PEARSON Think about therapist who has an agenda for an individual. 

00:24:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:24:55
PETER PEARSON It doesn't work. 

00:25:00
RICH SIMON All right. 

00:25:00
PETER PEARSON Which is a lot of the individuals approaches don't work with really distress couples. 

00:25:05
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. Okay. So let's, we'll, we'll come back to this. So that's uh, that's very interesting and a very uh, clear thing, people having notes. And this um, uh, is, is there um, uh, is there materials? These, these uh, this, these letters that you uh, that you, you send out beforehand that materials you send beforehand, is that something we can make available to people in the course? Okay, great. So we'll, people all of you uh, in the, in the program we'll, uh, we, we will make find a way for you to get that. You can get that. And you can get this on the, the Networker site. Now, just for a moment, so you've, this in terms of your process agenda and your uh, vision of what you're trying to accomplish, in terms of uh, uh, coaching the interaction the couple. Let's talk about your, the therapist then. So you have a model, sounds very clear and detailed, extremely thoughtful. What is it, and so now you have your first time trainees. That seems like a lot. I can do that, you know. Like you're telling me uh, you're giving me pretty detailed instructions about uh, what I'm suppose to do with a couple. What's the experience of uh, how do your, your people especially people seeing couples for the first time. What do they do with this structure and how does that speak more to this larger question here of as interns of our own self would we learn how to get comfortable in these situations with couples. What, what's uh, is, is this something that your trainees can immediately take to or there certain typical difficulties that uh, beginning couples therapist have even something as structured what your describing? 

00:26:50
ELLYN BADER Um, a lot of beginning couples therapist love having the structure, but you know that structure that Pete just described only takes up a small part of an initial, of a two hour session. 

00:27:00
RICH SIMON Oh, that's too bad. I didn't hear that, okay. 

00:27:05
ELLYN BADER I mean it would be great if it took up the whole thing. Um. 

00:27:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:27:05
ELLYN BADER And also there's not, there's other kinds of couples as well. 

00:27:10
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:27:10
ELLYN BADER But so, I mean I, when I'm starting with new therapist one of the things that I start off with is really asking them where do you feel weak, where do you feel like you're skills are not gonna serve you well? Or what are those um, fears that you have of going into that den? 

00:27:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:27:30
ELLYN BADER And so, we spend some time. 

00:27:30
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:27:30
ELLYN BADER On, on what are their real fears. And you know, their, their fears run the gamete cuz there's a lot of people who are afraid of conflict and there's a lot of people who are highly confrontive and have trouble with more passive more regressed couples too. 

00:27:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:27:45
ELLYN BADER So, um, I'm, I'm always starting with people whenever I can with what's your own cutting edge? And what, you know, so helping therapist define their cutting edge, what they want to develop in the course of the training program. 

00:28:00
PETER PEARSON So it keeps us from just imposing our structure automatically on the therapist. 

00:28:05
RICH SIMON Sure. So it's, it's somewhat analygst to before the, the couple comes in you, you orient them towards the, the culture of couples therapy. And so this is, this is kind of a parallel process with your, your trainees. And so, is, but in that initial thing and to prepare people for that first couples session, so that a piece of it, what is it? Where do you feel um, most vulnerable in doing this kind of work? What is this, what are the things most likely to push your button? Is there a, is there some other element that is, is important there in terms of just getting people to the state of readiness that they can begin this wonderful adventure of becoming a skilled couples therapist. What is, what is there about, how do you uh, help them to move into that role? 

00:28:55
ELLYN BADER So, I mean there's again a lot of answers to that. 

00:29:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:29:00
ELLYN BADER If somebody's in a training program part of it is creating the environment in the training program that they feel like they can come in there and take enormous risks. 

00:29:10
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:29:10
ELLYN BADER And I mean I, I said it up with my trainees that um, you know, if, if you're in this program you're gonna grow in ways personally. It's probably gonna create growth in your own marriages or your own primary relationships. 

00:29:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:29:25
ELLYN BADER And wanting to create the context in the group itself that supports people taking risks and trying out things. Because the, the way we approach couples there difference. And particularly one of the big differences is in the early stage with uh, either high conflict or very conflict avoidant couples part of it is um, we're not necessarily creating a situation where people feel better all the time. And so a therapist has to be able and this is especially true with a very conflict avoidant intimacy, avoidant couples. The therapist has to be able to tolerate being able to uh, separate people out a bit. And figure out, okay, what if she belongs to each partner. And being able to provoke some intensity in those relationships. And that feels risky. I mean, I can, I'll give you an example. 

00:30:20
RICH SIMON Great. 

00:30:20
ELLYN BADER It's, it's very, it's very common for therapist when they feel afraid to rely on what is pretty cliche question in our field. Which is, when they don't know what to do in the room, many times they will say to a partner, uh, will you tell your spouse what it is you need from him or her. 

00:30:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, Okay. 

00:30:40
ELLYN BADER That question, I cannot tell you how many transcripts I've read of sessions where a therapist says that. 

00:30:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:30:45
ELLYN BADER That is going to create enormous difficulty. 

00:30:50
PETER PEARSON Often. 

00:30:50
ELLYN BADER For, for man-, very often for them and for the couple. Because if in fact a partner is able to say to somebody well what I need, a typical answer is what I need from you is respect. Or you know, well first of all respect is a global giant thing. 

00:31:10
RICH SIMON Right 

00:31:10
ELLYN BADER That you can't um. 

00:31:10
PETER PEARSON I need more affection. 

00:31:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:31:10
ELLYN BADER But the partner immediately feels pressured. 

00:31:15
RICH SIMON And, and blamed. 

00:31:15
ELLYN BADER And blamed. And, and like they're suppose to give it. 

00:31:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:31:20
ELLYN BADER And in fact they're already in that pressure cooker before they even know what it is that they each are contributing to the problem that exist. 

00:31:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:31:30
ELLYN BADER And so they're already pulling on each other for more change, more, more of what they haven't been able to do for 20 years or whatever it is. Now they're, the therapist is creating even a stronger pull for them to be able to do what they haven't been able to do. 

00:31:45
RICH SIMON Yeah, okay. So that's sort of, of a sinkhole. And. 

00:31:50
PETER PEARSON Ah!. 

00:31:50
ELLYN BADER Yes. 

00:31:55
PETER PEARSON Huge. 

00:31:55
RICH SIMON Okay, so you're, you're, I, I was forcing what you where about, that grunt. All right. So um, I was so it, it, the, the one of the characteristics of uh, therapist of any kind, particularly the young therapist who learning the ropes is trying too hard. So what does that look like? 

00:32:15
PETER PEARSON Absolutely. 

00:32:15
RICH SIMON What is, what does that look like in, in this uh, early stage? In a moment we're gonna look. 

00:32:20
PETER PEARSON Ah, here, here's what, here's what it is. And it's not just beginning therapist but a lot of therapist get caught in this. 

00:32:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:32:25
PETER PEARSON Couples are hassling back and forth, back and forth and the therapist thinks okay. Well, I will help them be more understanding of each other. I will help them come to an agreement. And uh, so we will explore understand, and then we will find a solution this. And the couple will walk out thinking, I am so wonderful that they couldn't have done this without me. I will feel brilliant. They'll think I'm great and we're all gonna. Ah, okay. 

00:32:50
RICH SIMON Great, okay. 

00:32:50
PETER PEARSON Ah! So they struggle like hell to clarify with somebody who either A doesn't want to be clarified, B isn't interested in getting insight, C they're not interested in, interested in looking at their part in it. So that they can correct it. And now the therapist just feels overwhelmed. Geez they're resisting my brilliant interpretations. They're resisting my empathic understanding because the other person thinks I'm just getting snowed and they don't listen to me anyway. They just keep on fighting. That feels so anguishing for the therapist. They will say well why don't you just go to individual therapy and take care of it. 

00:33:30
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:33:30
PETER PEARSON Or I don't want to see anymore couples not if I have to risk this. It's too painful. 

00:33:35
RICH SIMON Right. This is, this is. 

00:33:40
PETER PEARSON And a couple will look, the therapist will work it like hell. And then the couple will look at the therapist and they'll, they'll ask that dreaded question. Well do you think we're getting anywhere? 

00:33:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Right. 

00:33:50
PETER PEARSON And when they ask that everybody in the room knows the answer. 

00:33:55
RICH SIMON So how do you and, and so, in your, in your training. Again this is a broad question but just kind of give us a sense of this. So with the therapist whose trying too hard and is doing the, the sort of thing that you're describing uh, just now. How do you help people get off that? What is it that, how do you, how do you help them reorient themselves to the process? 

00:34:20
PETER PEARSON Excellent question. 

00:34:20
ELLYN BADER That's for the therapist, though he said. 

00:34:20
PETER PEARSON Yeah, for the therapist, right? 

00:34:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:34:25
PETER PEARSON This is the time to talk about the clip. 

00:34:25
ELLYN BADER Uh, I'll, I'll add one thing before you talk about the clip. 

00:34:30
PETER PEARSON Okay. 

00:34:30
ELLYN BADER Which is uh, and that's a good thing. For, for the therapist who's working too hard when they're in training with me I will either set up role play. I will bring, I will have them bring in sometimes video clips where we can look at that exact moment when they're just, they dive into the working too hard. So we can process right then what they were experiencing before they started working too hard and why they think should. 

00:34:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:34:55
ELLYN BADER We work off their transcript. I mean I continually just like I may throw couples into the heat, I like to put therapist into the heat so they can experience themselves doing something different. Moving beyond their knee jerk defensive way of responding in a situation that's tight. 

00:35:15
PETER PEARSON See this is the advantage for, I encourage therapist to get into some kind of ongoing training program. Now I love going to conferences, listening to tele-seminars. I do that a lot; reading things. But then I try and I get stuck and I go now what. 

00:35:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:35:30
PETER PEARSON I thought I had, I thought I knew it! And they don't respond the way they should. Now what! 

00:35:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:35:35
PETER PEARSON And, but if I'm in a training program I get to ask that question. Now what? What happened? Why didn't it take? And that's the advantage of ongoing training versus going to a conference, which I like to do. I like conferences tele-seminars, etc. 

00:35:50
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:35:50
PETER PEARSON Uh, programs like this. But here's the thing, I think when therapist get stuck they're trying too hard to solve the content of the problem. And they, they get away from changing to the process for how they're discussing it. 

00:36:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:36:05
ELLYN BADER And the attitude. 

00:36:05
PETER PEARSON And the attitude behind it and working as a team. And I think again in either the first or second session I like to show just about all my couples now a really, really good clip from a movie called, Any Given Sunday. 

00:36:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:36:20
PETER PEARSON Where Al Pacino is talking to and extremely dysfunctional football team. 

00:36:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:36:30
PETER PEARSON Right before the Super Bowl. And I say to couples I, I tell them this, I say look I'm gonna show you this clip. It's and, it's not about football it's about marriages. And after you watch this clip I want you to say now here's what I can apply to my marriage. It, it's about relationships. You think it's about football, no it's not. 

00:36:50
RICH SIMON All right. 

00:36:50
PETER PEARSON And then I show them this clip. 

00:36:55
RICH SIMON All right, which is where, and ladies and gentlemen you're about to see this clip and so this is my uh, my chance to pretend a technical knowledge I don't have, but let me give it a shot. So you're gonna pause, you're gonna put your cursor over our image here on your screen. You're going to click pause. And then uh, below this image you're gonna see an indication where you can play this marvelous clip that uh, Pete has just described and (crosstalk) applied for uh, for just a few minutes. You're play your clip, you'll stop the clip when it's done and then you'll come back here and then you'll uh, go play and, and Pete and Ellyn will uh, tell us about this clip and how they. And now that we, once we've seen it and, and uh, explain to us how they use this and why this is such a helpful device in, in both their work with couples and, and I suppose with therapist as well. 

00:37:50
PETER PEARSON Training therapist, absolutely. 

00:37:55
RICH SIMON And both, all right. So, pause for a moment, go to play your clip and we'll, we'll be back with you in uh, once you're finished with that. All right. 

00:38:05
[sil.] 

00:38:05
Video clip from "Any Given Sunday" 

00:38:05
POSITIVELY NO VISITORS 

00:38:05
AL PACINO I don't know what to say, really. Three minutes for the biggest battle of our professional lives, all comes down to today. Now either we heal as a team or we're gonna crumble. Inch by inch, play by play till we're finished. We're in hell right now, gentlemen. Believe me. And we can stay here get the shit kicked out of us or we can fight our way back into the light. We can climb out of hell. One inch at a time. Now I can't do it for you, I'm too old. I look around I see these young faces and I think, I mean, I made every wrong choice a middle age man can make. I uh, I pissed away all my money, believe it or not. I chased off anyone who's ever loved me. And lately I can't even stand the face I see in the mirror. You know, when you get old in life things get taken from you. Well, that's, that's, that's part of life. But you only learn that when you start losing stuff. You find out life's this game of inches so it's football. Because in either game life or football the margin for error is so small, I mean one half a step too late or too early and you don't quite make it. One half second too slow or too fast you don't quite catch it. The inches we need are everywhere around us. 

00:40:25
UNKNOWN Hell yeah! 

00:40:25
AL PACINO They're in every break in the game, every minute, every second. 

00:40:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah! 

00:40:30
AL PACINO On this team we fight for that inch, on this team we tear ourselves and everyone else around us to pieces for that inch. We claw with our fingernails for that inch! 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN Hell yeah! 

00:40:50
AL PACINO Because we know when we add up all those inches that's gonna make the fucking difference between winning and losing! Between living and dying. I tell you this in any fight it's the guy who's willing to die who's gonna win that inch. And I know if I'm gonna have any life anymore it's because I'm still willing to fight and die for that inch. Because that's what living is! 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN That's right! 

00:41:25
AL PACINO The six inches in front of your face! Now I can't make you do it! You gotta look at the guy next to you, look into his eyes! Now I think you're gonna see a guy who will go that inch for you. 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN Hell yeah! 

00:41:40
AL PACINO You're gonna see a guy who will sacrifice himself for this team because he knows when it comes down to it you're gonna do the same for him. 

00:41:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah! 

00:41:50
AL PACINO That's a team, gentlemen. And either we heal now as a team or we will die as individuals. 

00:42:05
[sil.] 

00:42:05
AL PACINO That's football, guys. That's all it is. Now. 

00:42:15
UNKNOWN Sit down. 

00:42:20
AL PACINO What are you gonna do? 

00:42:25
[music] 

00:42:25
RICH SIMON What is the connection here? There was, that always had been a great movie moment for me. But what's the connection between Pacino's speech and your work with both couples and with, with therapist? 

00:42:55
PETER PEARSON So first of all I say to couples, you know, what stood out for you that you could apply to your marriage. Common responses are we got to do it an inch at a time. Other common response is we have to do this together. Al Pacino finishes as, "We either heal as a team." 

00:43:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:43:15
PETER PEARSON "Or we will die as individuals." 

00:43:15
RICH SIMON Okay. It makes sense. 

00:43:15
PETER PEARSON It's a key part. 

00:43:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:43:20
PETER PEARSON Uh, they talk about and what I emphasize to couples is what he's talking about is trust. Trust that the other person will do their job. Trust that when you say you do something you will follow through with it. And that is so crucial because when you're rebuilding a relationship at the very foundation, we're talking about trust. Without trust everything we do in here just blows away in the wind. We're building on a sand castles. Without trust which means that when you agree to do homework in here you have to treat it with the same degree of salinity as if I bring a Supreme Court Justice in with a stack of bibles and you swear you will do it. If you do not do your homework. 

00:44:05
RICH SIMON You sound a little bit like Pacino, as you're. 

00:44:10
PETER PEARSON I feel, I feel it. 

00:44:15
RICH SIMON You're feeling it. 

00:44:15
PETER PEARSON Is I really feel it because here it is. 

00:44:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:44:15
PETER PEARSON If you say you are going to do homework and we will pick out one small thing. If you do not do it, what you are telling you partner is you can't believe me when I say that I am going to do something. I lose credibility. You have every right to complain that I don't follow through. It's that crucial. And I'll say all I want you to do is follow that one homework assignment. You can fight about everything else, I don't care. This is, will define success between now and our next session. And man, do I underline that, underline it. 

00:44:50
RICH SIMON What, what? So here's my question to Ellyn. I want to hear your version of this. This guy sounds like Pacino. 

00:45:00
ELLYN BADER Uh, he. 

00:45:00
RICH SIMON So do you use this clip as well? And how does it sound when it comes? He, he, he does a great Pacino. Now do you do a Pacino or how do you make use of the same reel? 

00:45:10
ELLYN BADER I'm not able to do a Pacino in the way that uh, Pete is. However, um, I spend a part of my career working with football players and I say. 

00:45:20
RICH SIMON Really? 

00:45:20
ELLYN BADER And so, and I uh, uh, will say to . So first of all I ask the couple what, you know, what is your response to this clip? And the part of it that I emphasize the most is inch by inch. You know, Pacino talks about you got to claw your way out of hell inch by inch. 

00:45:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:45:40
PETER PEARSON Right. 

00:45:40
ELLYN BADER And so, when I, after I hear their reaction. And you know the reaction of women, particularly uh, is that even though some of them react to how strongly intense this clip is they love it that, that the man is telling men to be accountable. 

00:46:00
RICH SIMON Ah. 

00:46:00
ELLYN BADER Because for a long time they've been telling their husbands to be accountable and you know it doesn't work. And I'm a female therapist, so here I am bringing a male into the room. 

00:46:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:46:10
ELLYN BADER Whose making very compelling case for accountability. 

00:46:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:46:15
ELLYN BADER Now one thing I would add is that when you give that homework assignment that Pete's talking about that's based in trust especially if at the beginning you got to be sure enough that it is small enough. 

00:46:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:46:30
ELLYN BADER That they can do it and they can do it reliably. If the therapist sets them up for failure that's a whole different story. 

00:46:35
RICH SIMON That's not helpful, right. 

00:46:35
ELLYN BADER Right. 

00:46:35
RICH SIMON Okay. So this is, so what stands out here is this um, that this um, in terms of the culture. You're creating this uh, culture in the room that's different than the normal culture for the couple. And now just hearing this, this clip and then hearing how the two of you guys interpret that clip. That brings in a level of intensity that we're not used to in everyday interaction in that, in that. 

00:47:00
PETER PEARSON It gets even better. Rich, it gets even better. 

00:47:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:47:05
PETER PEARSON Cuz now we're talking about principals for making the relationship better. 

00:47:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:47:10
PETER PEARSON The confrontation doesn't now come from me the therapist which is too many therapist when they confront a couple it comes from me trying to hold one or the other accountable. No. 

00:47:20
ELLYN BADER That sounds judgmental. 

00:47:25
PETER PEARSON It sounds judgmental. You get a push back, you get resistance. Out of this model the framework for confrontation comes from you're not being a good team player. You're not following through with what you say you're going to do. So the team work concept is the holding pattern that makes the confrontation not the therapist. 

00:47:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:47:45
PETER PEARSON And that makes a huge, huge difference. 

00:47:50
RICH SIMON I'll say. 

00:47:50
PETER PEARSON It makes it easier for the therapist to say, well look here's what you said you were going to do. Another part of you said, no I'm gonna blow it off. I'm not gonna follow through. 

00:48:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:48:00
PETER PEARSON What side do you want your partner to listen to? 

00:48:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Okay. So now, in our time, we have about 15 minutes here. And I, what I, I know that part of uh, there two uh, on the spectrum of uh, of uh, of volatility spectrum of, of, with couples there are uh, extremes we have high conflict couples. What you guys call severely distressed couples. And on the other extreme you have the conflict avoidant couples. And that, these, these, these uh, couples present different kinds of challenges to therapist. And some therapist are at home with one and, and not with the other. And some of us are not at home with either of them. So let's in this, let's talk a little bit about the particular challenge of working with these particular kinds of couples. And let's start off with this severely distress couple. So, I think for, for many therapist, maybe particularly beginning therapist the idea of being in the midst of the crossfire with uh, people who are uh, uh, really angry with each other and, and can say and do some pretty hurtful things. Is scary and it makes you feel, can make you feel really powerless. And is a challenge. What is it that uh, in, in terms of, on the one hand what's the difficulty that some of us have beginning therapist not dealing with these severely distressed couples? And what is it that you, how do you help people to get more comfortable? Um, and more importantly more effective in working with a couple that has, on that part of the spectrum? 

00:49:40
PETER PEARSON Well you just, you just described a key word which is a feeling of powerless. If the therapist feels powerless. 

00:49:50
ELLYN BADER And helpless. 

00:49:50
PETER PEARSON And helpless in the face of intense pain. 

00:49:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:49:55
PETER PEARSON And anger and distress, if you do that too often. And it happened to me which is how I kind of evolved this framework. 

00:50:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:50:00
PETER PEARSON That I was feeling too powerless too often because they didn't want to listen. 

00:50:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:50:05
PETER PEARSON That's a prescription for burnout. And I don't care how many things I do in my life to take care of me. If I have to walk back in that room and feel powerless and helpless in the face of their intensity that creates burnout. 

00:50:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:50:20
PETER PEARSON So you just nailed it. And who wants to, who wants another helping of that, day after day after day. And most of my practice uh, I see about 20, 25 hours of couples a week. You will, I will end up with. 

00:50:35
RICH SIMON A lot of hours of couples a week, okay. 

00:50:35
PETER PEARSON Yes. 

00:50:40
RICH SIMON Well, you, you have clearly you have found a way to uh, to be in this force field where you're, you're not experienced, as powerful, powerless. 

00:50:45
ELLYN BADER He probably sees more couples a week than just about any therapist in the U.S. 

00:50:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:50:50
PETER PEARSON And so it's literally out of survival. 

00:50:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:50:55
PETER PEARSON That I had to find a way that got me out of the middle and made them work hard, make them work harder than I do or I burnout. I do not want to be the most motivated person in the world to create in the room. 

00:51:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:51:05
PETER PEARSON To create change. 

00:51:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:51:10
PETER PEARSON That's a burnout. Uh, so if I take. 

00:51:10
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) So how, how do we get to that oh, oh old Buddha. Tell us, tell us how. 

00:51:20
PETER PEARSON See in a sense Rich it, it summarizing what we already talked about. You, I begin to change their attitude toward change. 

00:51:25
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:51:25
PETER PEARSON And I begin to frame it as they have to change the process for how they talk about their problems. And when I say to them. 

00:51:35
ELLYN BADER And how they are with each other, how they're being with each other. 

00:51:35
PETER PEARSON How they're being with each other. And I would say, you guys or, are not ready to talk about solutions yet. Now how often are you gonna say that when an individual shows up? No. 

00:51:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:51:45
PETER PEARSON No, you're not ready to talk about how to solve this problem. No. 

00:51:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:51:50
PETER PEARSON And even with more mildly less distress couples, you don't have to be quite so directive. They're more receptive to being coached and interpretations. They accept it, they can work with it. So very distressed couples, they, they will want to focus on solutions, how do we solve the problem. I tell them, you're not ready. So I, I, to just to summarize what we've talked about. First you guys have to learn to work together. 

00:52:15
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:52:15
PETER PEARSON You have to change how you talk about things. I've shown the Al Pacino clip. 

00:52:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:52:20
PETER PEARSON I give them the uh, structure. Here's the topic, here's the intention. How do you aspire to be? How do you want your partner to feel? You get clear what that and I'll go ahead and start talking. And they will experience it. And all you guys do, you're just talking about changing the process. You will learn as a team together to get out of the mess you're in. You've dug yourself into a huge hole. The way we're going about it will not solve all your problems. Because they all say well this doesn't solve the big issues. I say, no there so many leaks in this ship that we can only do it one at a time. 

00:53:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:53:00
PETER PEARSON That's it. We're not gonna get to the core of the problem right away and solve it. One at a time, inch by inch. You guys are gonna climb out of hell into the light. And this is the way you're going to do it. 

00:53:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:53:15
PETER PEARSON So I focus on the teamwork I make them do work. They have to stay in this structure of being a team. Now there's a lot 

00:53:20
ELLYN BADER Can I add something? 

00:53:20
PETER PEARSON There's a lot of experience that takes with doing that with skill, you know you're not gonna. 

00:53:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:53:25
PETER PEARSON Do that fresh out of graduate school but it, fresh out of graduate school you're gonna feel more in charge. 

00:53:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:53:30
ELLYN BADER And I, another part of that Rich is. 

00:53:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:53:30
ELLYN BADER Helping them learn how to accept coaching from each other. 

00:53:35
PETER PEARSON Yes. 

00:53:35
ELLYN BADER That it's not only coaching from the therapist. 

00:53:40
PETER PEARSON Right. 

00:53:40
ELLYN BADER Yes, but you know, what you run into with severely distressed couples is that feeling that my partner says, hey that's not working for me. Somebody often says, well I don't want you controlling me. 

00:53:50
PETER PEARSON Right. 

00:53:50
ELLYN BADER So, they interpret what could be good coaching would help them stay with their limbic systems not too highly activated and be to change their process of communicating. They, they don't accept the coaching and then they fight about the coaching. So I mean we have a number of repair processes that we teach. But that's down the road a little ways after they're willing to accept coaching from each other. 

00:54:15
PETER PEARSON Basically we say you guys will learn to be a student and teacher of each other. 

00:54:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:54:20
PETER PEARSON You will learn about the other one, and you will teach the other one how to work with you they will teach you how to work with them. And you will do it when you really get good without feeling controlled or bossed, or manipulated. You're doing it for the greater good because you want to create something better. How you deal with the pain that's in your emotional brain, how you deal with that pain will determine either how magnificent or how miserable your relationship is gonna be. You can learn how to deal with it a whole lot better by changing the process. 

00:54:50
RICH SIMON So, and, and with Al Pacino as you co-therapist then that, that's a chance at a particular problem. So, early on what you're, what you've laid out for us is you guys are creating this, this new culture for change. You're establishing them in the first couple of sessions basically the framework within which you work and then you keep, you come back to that again and again, and then if you, if and, presumably with the people who really uh, who, who benefit most from their work with you there's a buy in to this new. 

00:55:25
PETER PEARSON Yes. 

00:55:25
RICH SIMON Culture. And you have agreed upon concepts and metaphors that then are uh, that become the frame of reference that regulates this process. Now in the, let's in the time that we have. Then we have the other extreme, we have the conflict avoidant couple uh, who uh, um, are, present their own challenges. And, and Ellyn want, want to talk to us a little bit about what those challenges are and how you, how you deal with those, that kind of couple. 

00:55:50
ELLYN BADER Sure. Uh, first of all Rich, everybody is conflict avoidant sometime. 

00:55:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:55:55
ELLYN BADER They're pretty much everybody. And so we're not talking about the mildly conflict avoidiner, when you. 

00:56:00
RICH SIMON It's Al Pacino. At least he's Scarface. 

00:56:05
ELLYN BADER Right. 

00:56:05
RICH SIMON He's, he's in some of his other roles his a little more, more conflict avoidant. But I'm sorry go ahead. 

00:56:10
ELLYN BADER Okay. So, but I'm talking about this, the, the kind of couple and there are many of these, who come into therapy and they are what we call either the tension filled. Because they have avoided so many issues for such a long time that you, the therapist will sit in the room with them and your stomach is gonna hurt, your jaws gonna be tight. Uh, you can feel all the unsaid things that they don't want to talk about. 

00:56:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:56:35
ELLYN BADER So that's one type. There's another type that's also been together a long time that are very friendly and that everybody likes. But they're interaction is totally superficial. They don't feel any connection with each other but they don't even say that because, you know, they are so likable in a certain way. But they don't have any juice in their relationship. 

00:57:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:57:00
ELLYN BADER So, so part of the issue with couples on this end of the continuum is they have over time their interaction has sapped all the vitality, all the intimacy, all the juice out of their relationship. And they have sacrificed self, they have sacrificed you know, uh, things that really matter to them for the preservation or their belief preservation of the marriage or relationship. And don't even understand why they're so miserable and why they feel so lonely and so empty. 

00:57:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:57:35
ELLYN BADER And so, I mean so these couples present a challenge to therapist because the interaction patterns are, have gone on for a really long time. And they don't even have insight to what would begin to make a difference. And they're usually high sensitive, highly fearful about moving into any kind of intensity. And so, a big piece of the work is creating intensity in the room and being able, the therapist being able to help them create intensity. And having experiences in the room that are more intense than what they'll be able to have at home. 

00:58:10
PETER PEARSON See mostly. 

00:58:15
RICH SIMON Uh, so how does that play itself out? So give us some example of, with, so these uh, this lovely and very vivid description of a style of, of couple, I think we're all familiar with. So what, and when you, you're building intensity how might you do this. Is there a particular couple come to mind, uh, just give us a flavor or. 

00:58:35
ELLYN BADER Yeah, I can, I can give you our, our classic example and then there some others. But I, the, the couple that I'll always remember best was actually in workshop. But both of us had done some individual work with them as well. I mean some, some couples work. But uh, uh, this was a couple who had been married for 10 years and they didn't talk about anything. I mean there were addiction issues. There were uh, you know, other issues definitely. And um, we taught them a process of communication called the initiator inquirer, which is something we train a lot of our clients in. And it's, we can't go into it today. But it's a whole process that provides developmental assist so people learn to be able to go deeper with each other. But in that, in their, in one of their dialogues she said to him, "Do you really, really want to know how I feel?" And he said, "Yes, we've never, you know, we haven't talked about. I really want to know." And she said, "I pray for your death." 

00:59:35
PETER PEARSON And this guys in good, good physical condition. 

00:59:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:59:40
ELLYN BADER Now you know the normal response for a lot of therapist would be let's gloss this over as quickly as we can. 

00:59:45
RICH SIMON Oh, oh my. Yeah. 

00:59:45
ELLYN BADER Yeah, this is not a conversation you want to go into. 

00:59:50
RICH SIMON Oh my. Yeah. 

00:59:50
ELLYN BADER But, but we encourage him to actually think about a question to ask her. Like what could you. 

01:00:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:00:00
ELLYN BADER How could you ask her to actually tell you more? 

01:00:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:00:00
ELLYN BADER About this. 

01:00:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:00:05
ELLYN BADER And he took, he took a long time. You could watch the wheels spinning in his head. 

01:00:05
RICH SIMON Sure. 

01:00:10
ELLYN BADER And then he turned to her and he said, "And just how long have you been praying?" Which is wonderful, wonderful question. And we gave him a lot of support for asking that question. 

01:00:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

01:00:20
ELLYN BADER And she proceeded, she proceeded with some help and a little coaching to say, she, you know, she'd been praying for 10 years. Because she was Catholic, she couldn't imagine a way out of the marriage other than him dying. And you know. 

01:00:35
PETER PEARSON She didn't want a divorce. And if he died that would be the solution. 

01:00:40
RICH SIMON Oh boy. That, that's, yep. 

01:00:45
PETER PEARSON So it, it. 

01:00:45
RICH SIMON Uh. 

01:00:45
PETER PEARSON What's really cool, the next day in the workshop they're walking down the highway and there's this big truck coming at them. And he says to her, "Well, now's your chance." 

01:00:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:00:55
PETER PEARSON And she said, "Well at that moment the hourglass of our marriage turned upside down because I realized I could start talking to him about what's the deepest secrets in my heart and he could handle it." 

01:01:10
RICH SIMON Oh. 

01:01:10
PETER PEARSON And I never believed before that he could tolerate or handle what was really in my deepest darkest shadow self. 

01:01:20
RICH SIMON Oh my. That's quite a, that's quite a speech there. That's quite a moment. 

01:01:25
ELLYN BADER But that a moment, that was the moment in which they began to take risk with each other that they had never taken before. 

01:01:30
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. Now it's interesting. 

01:01:35
PETER PEARSON So, and just one other thing about, these couples who are really high conflict avoidant they have a lot of compassion and there's no passion. But there's a lot compassion. The severely distress couples have a lot of passion but there's no compassion. 

01:01:50
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

01:01:50
PETER PEARSON And so like they're very different from each other in that way. It's when couples can start to integrate passion with compassion. 

01:01:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:02:00
PETER PEARSON That they start really feeling like they're realizing the promise of why they got together. 

01:02:05
RICH SIMON Okay. So, as you look at your experiences as uh, as therapist, as trainers. You've been doing this for a long time. What's uh, and you kind of stand back from this process. What is it that um, in, in a given case we can't help everyone who comes to us. I think we at some point along the way we discover that. What's the, what's your understanding when you're, the, the difference between the cases that you have where you feel you really made a difference for folks. You helped them to, to find, to discover some other way to be with each other or whatever it is. Whether they stay together or, or maybe even if they didn't. And the ones where you, you haven't had the impact. How do you, how do you understand what where you're effective or, or you're not effective? Is, at, at this stage of the game do you have a sense of what it is that makes a difference and what needs to happen? That um, uh, and when it doesn't happen that's, that's really the deciding factor in this process of change and whether it takes place or not. 

01:03:05
ELLYN BADER I mean this is gonna sound a little theoretical but we teach a lot and talk a lot about differentiation. And to me that's such a core concept because the couples who will let us help them move into a successful process of differentiation. And I'm not talking about sudo autonomy or independence, or that kind of thing. I'm talking about the real ability to be together and not get caught up in the intensity of each other's emotions and explore and experience more parts of each other. 

01:03:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:03:40
ELLYN BADER I use the example often of a disco ball and all the mirrors on the disco ball are different aspects of ourselves. 

01:03:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:03:45
ELLYN BADER And the couples who are able to confided in each other, to open their hearts to each other, to allow to be known to each other. And you know, that shift for couples who chronically have been as Pete's says either severely depress-, uh, distressed and not able to collaborate effectively, and those who have been very severely conflict avoidant. In both of those they're arrested in terms of not being able to tolerate any effective differentiation. So to me the ones who let us hold them through that process and get them there are, is what makes a difference. 

01:04:25
RICH SIMON Okay. And so, here, here's the last thing cuz we are just about out of time. So you folks are, are um, you know highly accomplished at doing this work. You've devoted your life to it. What's, what remains, what challenging for, for you at this stage in the game? What do you continue to learn about yourselves as couples therapists? You've described of this, this learning curve beginning for the young therapist. For at, at this stage of the game are there things that you find yourself working on in your, uh, separately in your own work with couples? 

01:05:00
ELLYN BADER You wanna take it? Mmm? 

01:05:05
PETER PEARSON Uh, I just watched a Ted talk about how they're changing the reaction to trauma in rats by explosiv-, by exposing individual nerve cells to light. And I think we are just on the cusp. 

01:05:20
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

01:05:20
PETER PEARSON Of understanding how the brain works. And what it does and what really creates change that goes on in the brain. We are just, just on the cusp of doing that. 

01:05:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:05:35
PETER PEARSON And so why work, why it do work for some people, why not? We have theories. 

01:05:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:05:40
PETER PEARSON And that's it. We just have theories. 

01:05:40
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. Okay. You want to weigh in on this one Ellyn just before, before we go? 

01:05:45
ELLYN BADER Sure I'll weigh, I'll weigh on a different aspect of it. Um. 

01:05:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:05:50
ELLYN BADER When I'm at my best with a couple I am asking myself each time I walk out of a session uh, where could I have pushed myself and them more effectively, in a better way, what was I afraid of, what were the moments in the session when I was timid. And I'm you know, and I use that to come back to the next session. 

01:06:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:06:15
ELLYN BADER And I know that I'm at, I know I'm at my best when I actually do that. 

01:06:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:06:15
ELLYN BADER Rather than kind of just going in and winging it. 

01:06:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. Okay. 

01:06:20
PETER PEARSON When I have a really good session I just want to savor it. 

01:06:30
RICH SIMON Well guys, thank you so much. I mean I think we've given such a vivid picture of both your particular style of working and just this process there are other models of couple therapy but clearly you guys have developed a very, uh, thoughtful and a very coherent model of how you just create this environment in which uh, change can happen. And people who have developed your, you know, you're changing these entrenched patterns in couples' relationships. And with a little help from Al Pacino it sounds, it, it sounds like a very powerful experience to work with the two of you. I want to invite people to two things. One, to comment on uh, this conversation and to continue it. So you'll see the comment board link below the image on your screen. And then also um, Pete and Ellyn have uh, a uh, you'll see their website on our fulfillment page. So there's uh, can you say a little about your, your website and your trainings so people who are interested in following up with, with the two of you about finding out more about your particular way of working with couples and developing their own skills. 

01:07:40
ELLYN BADER Sure, uh, we do an online training program which is probably best for most of your readers or listeners. 

01:07:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:07:45
ELLYN BADER I would, which people can find out more about at uh, www.couplestherapyacademy.com. 

01:07:55

01:08:10
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:08:10
ELLYN BADER Also on our. 

01:08:10
PETER PEARSON I think the best part of that training program is that, A it's ongoing. But even more importantly, if you get stuck with a couple, you can ask Ellyn a question and she'll get back to you before the next session. 

01:08:25
RICH SIMON Wow. 

01:08:25
PETER PEARSON About how to deal with it. So it's that immediate feedback. Very personalized, immediate feedback when you get stuck. And we all get stuck. 

01:08:35
RICH SIMON Sure. 

01:08:35
PETER PEARSON And so to say, "Whoa, wait a minute! Help me understand what's going on. What can I do?" And get a response before the next session that's cool. 

01:08:45
RICH SIMON That's cool, very cool. Okay. 

01:08:45
ELLYN BADER Just one other thing. On our main, other website which is, couplesinstitute.com there are loads of articles and they can sign up for our newsletter.
