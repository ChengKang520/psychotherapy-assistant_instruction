University of Wales, Newport Prifysgol Cymru, Casnewydd Michael Jacobs in Conversation with Frank Wills a programme from the School of Social Studies

00:00:45
FRANK WILLS My name is Frank Wills and I work on the counseling studies program in the University of Wales, Newport. I am really pleased today to welcome Michael Jacobs to the University. And I’ll be interviewing Michael as part of our ongoing series of conversations with people who have made significant contributions to the development of counseling in Britain. Michael worked in the university counseling sector and also in pastoral counseling and was one of the group of very active pioneers who developed and contributed to counseling both within the BACP and without that organization. He wrote a best selling book on pastoral counseling in 1982 and since then has published a voucher of high quality influential books on pastoral counseling among psychodynamic counseling. Whilst he is able to describe concepts at the very highest level of sophistication, his writing is actually very user friendly and is focused on practical applications that counselors can use in every day practice. His ideas are clear, but he is not daunted in the least bit by reputation and reckons he has become more critical of received wisdom as his career has developed. He is for example critical of Donald Winnicott for ignoring the role of the father in the development of children. Perhaps not a surprising point for a man who is both a father and a grandfather. I am really looking forward to discovering more about the origin and development of his ideas. So then, let’s now look at the video. Okay, well, Michael welcome to the University of Wales at Newport. I am very pleased to have you here. I'm looking forward to exploring lots of your ideas with you. I’ve obviously to prepare myself I’ve been looking at some of your, reconciling your books and… And one of the things that I do really like about them is I think they’re all very user friendly actually. They explain difficult concepts in quite accessible ways. So I am hoping… really looking forward to kind of exploring and going into those… 

00:03:00
MICHAEL JACOBS I might say something about that and that is the it is being one of my principles in writing that I should never put anything down on paper that I haven’t understood myself. 

00:03:05
FRANK WILLS Umm… 

00:03:10
MICHAEL JACOBS And I think some writing, unfortunately, people do use phrases and things which look grand but actually I am not absolutely going to say they, they, they always know what they mean. And all they… So I had… So I had want to put something down. And if I don’t understand it, I think my reader wouldn't understand it, so let’s explain to him. 

00:03:25
FRANK WILLS Well, I must say (inaudible ) I am really, I am really in that. And… And I’ve been looking right back at some of your early work as well and umm…umm… I noted that you began life as a, began professional life as an, as far as I know anyway as a director of pastoral care. Can you tell me a bit about that? 

00:03:50
MICHAEL JACOBS No, not strictly speaking umm… I was originally an Anglican priest working in, first one in London. And I was a Chaplain and interdenominational chaplain at University of Sussex. And… And it was there that I began to practice counseling. And… And when that job folded, because there was no more money for it and I have to look for work. I wanted to go on working in universities, but I also wanted to go and working in… in counseling. And I was very fortunate, I got a job as a student counselor at the University of Leicester. And it was much later on that I actually became a director of pastoral care and counseling… 

00:04:35
FRANK WILLS Oh I see! 

00:04:35
MICHAEL JACOBS …for three daisies. 

00:04:35
FRANK WILLS Alright. 

00:04:35
MICHAEL JACOBS But at the time I was in touch with some of my former colleagues in the church. And I remember the (inaudible ) to pastoral care and counseling so that it’s probably the very early link that you are referring to. 

00:04:50
FRANK WILLS Right! But there seems to be, you know a theme that early of being interested in people and helping people from many different perspectives. 

00:05:00
MICHAEL JACOBS Yes, yes! I mean that of course is the link between pastoral work and counseling work or pastoral care and counseling work that very clear link and if one of the reasons that you move into that profession within the church is to be of some used people then it's understandable that I like actually quite not about a few other people have moved from that into other professions where we can be of use to people. Perhaps some of us thinking that we can be of use to more people then we could have been have we stayed in the church. 

00:05:30
FRANK WILLS Right, right! And, you know obviously one of the recurring themes of your work is the way the past, present, yes… 

00:05:40
MICHAEL JACOBS Hmm… 

00:05:40
FRANK WILLS …in the here and now. I mean, and what sort of legacy do you think comes from your sort of religious works and to your work now? 

00:05:55
MICHAEL JACOBS Well, it’s… It’s on many different levels I think and, it’s quite hard probably to disentangle them. There is this whole interesting area about belief and faith, which I think has stayed with me and my beliefs and my faith has shifted and changed enormously throughout my life. And obviously that’s probably true of many people that their beliefs have changed. They do change, they… Some might say they developed, some might say they lose their faith. But whatever way you want to look at it. And that area of what, why we believe and how we believe. And that really has interested me and going in on interesting me, interesting me right through my life. And I suppose that really came to culmination in the book which is called Illusion: A Psychodynamic Interpretation of Thinking and Belief. So that’s one level which is there. Then, of course there is the whole area of concern for other people that we just referred to. And in that sense there are links, I think between the whole counseling world and the pastoral world that… there is our notion of guilt, there is the notion of forgiveness and so on, which need to be translated in various ways, but those are interesting ideas. So I think it’s in that respect probably that that links stays there. As well as I am always still very interested in trying to enable people who are working within the pastoral setting to improve their skills. 

00:07:40
FRANK WILLS And of course that they do make quite a lot of distress. 

00:07:45
MICHAEL JACOBS Yeah, they do. Umm… 

00:07:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:07:45
MICHAEL JACOBS Huge amount of distress. I mean, they have the advantage of actually being on the spot when I was distressed, in the way that many counselors of course have people referred to them in this distress, but there is a whole area where that can be done there, I believe. But it’s not, I’d have to say, it’s not a huge part of my life now when it was at one stage and after where I was responsible for the training and assistance of clergy in three daisies. 

00:08:15
FRANK WILLS From what you said, you came to think that you could may be do more with people by moving into the counseling work. 

00:08:25
MICHAEL JACOBS Well, I think it was, I think it was a whole variety of things. I mean, I think in the first place it was that within a university, and you would know this in the university here too, within the university, there is a climate for questioning and an openness to critical thinking, which I think has not been and is not altogether present within the church. And that’s actually very hard for those of us who actually want to question. So I think at that particular point in my life it came actually very important to get out of an institution where it was impossible to think without being called in names in one way or another you know, by those who… in one way or another who they belief systems was much more conservative and that’s fine. I’ve no objection to them having those beliefs, but when they object to me, to my beliefs… 

00:09:15
FRANK WILLS Umm… 

00:09:15
MICHAEL JACOBS …that was one reason. And I think second one was that I had actually begun to do a huge amount of reading around the link between religion and psychoanalysis and Freud particularly. And the opportunity then came to be able to translate some of that thinking which I read in Freud, very basic stuff of course for me in those days, but to translate that into action in terms of becoming a counselor, in a very amateurish way. I have to say looking back on it, but nevertheless one seem to work and we do know actually that sometimes the good amateur works actually rather well. And from that I think there came the whole business of how do I develop my thinking which up to now has been about a certain number of theological concepts. How do I now change, work and develop this thinking, because actually I find these psychological concept really very exciting, actually much more fresh and alive than some of these old theological concept which I have taught and I felt that I have to talk about and preach about and so on. But now actually I’ve got something here which I think brings those concept to live as well. So, it was in that sense and I think that psychoanalysis grabbed me. You know this… It was a sort of new religion in a way for me. 

00:10:40
FRANK WILLS You said something that which I probably would like to pick… 

00:10:45
MICHAEL JACOBS Umm… 

00:10:45
FRANK WILLS …pick a bit later, but about, you know the need for critical thinking. 

00:10:50
MICHAEL JACOBS Umm… 

00:10:50
FRANK WILLS And it comes over quite strongly in your books, I think that… 

00:10:55
MICHAEL JACOBS Umm… 

00:10:55
FRANK WILLS …that your own man as far as that goes and you don't like something in the palsy line necessarily. 

00:11:00
MICHAEL JACOBS I don’t… I don't like trying to (inaudible ). 

00:11:06
FRANK WILLS That’s exactly. 

00:11:06
MICHAEL JACOBS You know I'll defend it if I think it's right, but I won’t. Umm… 

00:11:10
FRANK WILLS Okay. So I've tracked down the title what I think it was your first paper. 

00:11:15
MICHAEL JACOBS Umm… 

00:11:15
FRANK WILLS And I'm trying to be occupied throwing at you, but I think it does contain a few things which appear in your later work. 

00:11:20
MICHAEL JACOBS Umm…Hmm… 

00:11:20
FRANK WILLS And as far as I know it was something about naming and labeling… 

00:11:25
MICHAEL JACOBS That's right. 

00:11:30
FRANK WILLS …in the helping process. 

00:11:30
MICHAEL JACOBS (crosstalk)(inaudible) back in 1976. 

00:11:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 76, yes. So… And you expand on those actually in later publications? 

00:11:40
MICHAEL JACOBS I expand that. I just… Yes, I certainly I expand on that in the second edition representing past, but actually felt that the whole business about the way in which we label people, which in that particular article, I was applying very much the psychiatric profession. I could reply just as much as psychoanalyst as well. And so, what I wanted to do was what sort of preface my major part of the book by saying the goodness they don’t start using this book to label people, which is what I found you know if I… if you write a book and you then teach from that book and you then start reading people's essays and exam answers quoting you. 

00:12:20
FRANK WILLS Umm…Hmm… 

00:12:20
MICHAEL JACOBS You find what they’ve done is to turn it into stone. 

00:12:25
FRANK WILLS Umm…Hmm… 

00:12:25
MICHAEL JACOBS And to start characterize people as this or that or the other, because they read it in the book. And that… I’m trying to stop people doing that. 

00:12:35
FRANK WILLS And interestingly though, you kind of make… you do point out so and I would agree with you on this point that there is, there can be something very helpful though about the clients realizing what is happening to them and you used the term naming to. 

00:12:55
MICHAEL JACOBS That was the huge… That's a major difference and that is that the client can name what they’re experiencing and they begin to name things which they haven't been able to name before or sometimes the therapist can name it at the point at which the client is ready to recognize it. You are beginning to think something as you listen to someone. And then they say, I think I might be such and such and that's just what you have been thinking too. And at that point you can say, yes, I was thinking that as well. And that particular point it feels as if, they have named something you’ve affirmed what they named about it. 

00:13:35
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:13:40
MICHAEL JACOBS I think I'm prone to be very self-critical, I might begin that somebody saying, I think I do myself down. It sounds like thinking that too. And that matches the best way in which it happens is that you… 

00:13:55
FRANK WILLS Sense of joins your leadership. 

00:13:55
MICHAEL JACOBS Yes, that's right. I want to join, yeah that's right. But, there are other times. I think when sometimes the therapist actually recognizes something and puts it into words and uses the word, uses a word which at that point is just the right word for the client, it’s just what they want. They've just, they've been generally describing something and then you use one word which as it was sums it all up, yeah, yeah, that's it, that's it exactly. And I think that's, that's, that's, that's naming. Now, that's very different from saying that I think you are in obsessive compulsive. 

00:14:30
FRANK WILLS And if I can share experience of my own here you know I’ll be interested to what your comment would be but I do in my own practice, I work with quite a lot of people who would meet the diagnostic criteria for depression. 

00:14:45
MICHAEL JACOBS Umm… 

00:14:45
FRANK WILLS And I'm interested that when this is established you know that they are in that ballpark, which is a way I prefer to look at it rather than a label. 

00:14:55
MICHAEL JACOBS Umm… 

00:14:55
FRANK WILLS You know we are in the ballpark of depression. And some of them are very relieved. And for them it has you know it explains a lot of things about what they've been feeling. For other people it's very scary, because they, you know they have a different interpretation of what the word depressed means, but that is actually a, it’s like a label, a well known psychiatric label, but it also can act, I believe in a naming way, would you? 

00:15:25
MICHAEL JACOBS Yes, I go along with that. I mean, I think sometimes for someone to say to somebody yes you are depressed. Actually is a much better way of putting it than they think they are going mad for example. On the other hand, I mean, I would say that, you know just use the word depression and you used a, I think a term ballpark, it's absolutely right. It's a huge area and I'm not really interested. I mean, the fact that they are depressed and that that's been recognized is terribly important, but then what's important is what I'm doing. So the label in itself, if we’re not careful well, it stops. It just stops things happening, whether it’s people going to doctor, and doctor say, oh you’re so depressed and puts on tablets. And there is no further exploration at all. 

00:16:10
FRANK WILLS Or action. 

00:16:10
MICHAEL JACOBS No action. You think some bereavement, oh yes you’re so depressed. There is no… There is no sense in which actually what's going on in terms of the grief that's there and the whole grieving process is really examined and it seems to me that that's what the counselor can do. 

00:16:30
FRANK WILLS Another point about the naming issue, which struck me and as a nice one was the fact that you used I think the Wizard of Earthsea… 

00:16:40
MICHAEL JACOBS Umm…Hmm… 

00:16:40
FRANK WILLS …as an illustration and this is something I've noticed that you do a lot. 

00:16:45
MICHAEL JACOBS Umm… 

00:16:45
FRANK WILLS You know you use references to novels and… 

00:16:50
MICHAEL JACOBS Umm…Hmm… 

00:16:50
FRANK WILLS And other literary forms in your… in your work. 

00:16:55
MICHAEL JACOBS Yes, I do. I mean, it's partly because obviously I enjoy literature. I'm a frustrated person who has never been able to read English as it was at degree like many people. But it's moonlight. I mean, I think it is that the poets, the novelists, the artists, the musician and have said all these things that others coming along afterwards whether they be cognitive psychologists or (inaudible ) psychologist, whether they be analysts, whether they be persons, all these people are only saying putting into various ways, expressions of what people have said in poetry and novels and so on. Now, you have particularly of course in the 19th century, in the development of what might call the psychological novel. It ceases to be plot you know and all the adventures that the people are having or ceases to be commentary on society so much is that still remains there. But it actually is an exploration of what’s going on inside of people. It’s… And that’s why I think Dickens was so important to me when I wrote the Psychodynamic Counselling in Action. The one reason for using it was that. And then I find that in Wizard of Earthsea quite right and I find, but I find in many other places that to be able to quote a piece of poetry or to at quote a character in a novel, really brings thing alive and shows another dimension to this which is over and above the client who one might otherwise think is, I mean, I wouldn’t think so but some people, I think is abnormal. 

00:18:45
FRANK WILLS Umm…Hmm… 

00:18:45
MICHAEL JACOBS Unusual, and I’m fascinated by it and actually at the moment now just preparing a new course on Shakespeare On The Couch when I’m wanting to look at a number of parings in Shakespeare’s plays and the relationship between them to try and relate that to the issues that we now still confront in this 21st century. 

00:19:10
FRANK WILLS Have you written any poetry or novel? 

00:19:10
MICHAEL JACOBS No, no, no, no about. I’m not a poet. I don’t play any instruments. I’ve never written a novel. I couldn’t ever do it. I just enjoy. 

00:19:20
FRANK WILLS You like the other people doing it, well? 

00:19:25
MICHAEL JACOBS Yes, and I will use it. And I’m drawing out what I think is there. And you know I also, in some of my workshops I use music as well because I think it can be dramatically bring to life something which words alone can't. 

00:19:40
FRANK WILLS Okay, I wonder if we can move on from your first paper and what came out of that. I’m interested in the two books you wrote about counseling, pastoral counseling… 

00:19:50
MICHAEL JACOBS Yes. 

00:19:50
FRANK WILLS …in the mid 80's. 

00:19:55
MICHAEL JACOBS Umm… 

00:19:55
FRANK WILLS That was this Small Still Voice. 

00:19:55
MICHAEL JACOBS Still Small Voice. 

00:19:55
FRANK WILLS Still Small Voice, a great title by the way. Is that a quotation? 

00:20:00
MICHAEL JACOBS Yes it’s a quotation from… Do you remember Elijah hiding in the cave and first of all there is a great tempest and wind deposit by and then something else go and then there is the still small voice. 

00:20:15
FRANK WILLS It’s a biblical. 

00:20:15
MICHAEL JACOBS It’s biblical. And it actually came to me. I had written… I was writing, oh I think I might have even written a book and I don’t know what goliath and it came to me. I can almost envisage the place when I was driving the car and suddenly the still small voice spoke to me, the Still Small Voice that’s it, that's just the title and it is. 

00:20:35
FRANK WILLS And what your mind was that conveying about what you are trying to say at that? 

00:20:35
MICHAEL JACOBS Well, that there is within each person. If you listen within yourself, there is a very small voice that normally not heard with all the clutter of everything else that’s around, which is actually telling you something terribly important and that it’s the task, one of the task as a counselor therapist is to listen, to hear that still small voice to be able to reflect it back to the client. But also to listen to the still small voice within themselves of course, which then enables them to monitor whether what they are hearing in themselves may also be something that applies to this client can usefully be shared. Because I think we human beings communicate at a far deeper level of just words. 

00:21:25
FRANK WILLS And I think you are also advocating in that and the twin. 

00:21:35
MICHAEL JACOBS Yeah, Swift to Here. 

00:21:35
FRANK WILLS Swift to here, yeah, that also about the counselor… 

00:21:35
MICHAEL JACOBS Another biblical, another biblical quote. 

00:21:35
FRANK WILLS Alright, is that one yes. What does that mean? 

00:21:40
MICHAEL JACOBS Letter to James or from James, something I can’t remember my new testament very well, but though I’m… but it’s yes. 

00:21:45
FRANK WILLS And, you know you also I think advocate that the therapists themselves is aware of their own. 

00:21:55
MICHAEL JACOBS That’s right. 

00:21:55
FRANK WILLS Still small voice as it were. 

00:22:00
MICHAEL JACOBS Right, yes and in psychodynamic terms it’s what is referred to by the label of counter transference. And that is… One aspect of it is that you need to be listening to yourself and you need to be listening to… You need to listen to yourself and when you hear things or you feel things, you experience things within yourself, you then need to make a judgment, is this something about me, purely about me, which actually is extraneous to this situation, which I’m in? Is this something about me which is my issue and I mustn’t let this interfere with what’s going on for this client? Or does this say something actually about me and this client which is really important and might be able to be used? 

00:22:40
FRANK WILLS And in the, you know Swift to Hear book, there is a lot of (inaudible ) there on your listening skills. 

00:22:46
MICHAEL JACOBS Yes! Umm… 

00:22:50
FRANK WILLS And, you know, I think there was lot of interest in that time following the radio series, I don’t know if you listen to the video search by Hazel Johnston and (inaudible ) on the Egan model. There is quite a bit on that in the… There isn’t a great emphasis on psychodynamic work at that point in time. 

00:23:10
MICHAEL JACOBS No, there isn’t. I mean, it’s… I think it’s one of the fascinating things that partly came out of my links with the pastoral care counseling movement, where one stage I used to be the abstractor of articles from the American General Pastoral Care for a British journal. And there was a particular article on listening skills, which I don’t think it was actually influenced by Egan at all. But I remember reading it. And I was at that point about to start teaching some counseling ideas at a very sort of brief course of doing. And I thought to myself, well I think that looks really good that we need to actually try and develop ideas about listening and reflecting and so on. And I have to say that the book is full of mainly my own ideas. Now may well be ideas which are written in Egan or elsewhere about listening and responding. I don’t know. It’s just a pure coincidence. But what was fascinating was that I then realized that none of this was traditionally taught in psychodynamic training. 

00:24:25
FRANK WILLS Umm…Umm… 

00:24:30
MICHAEL JACOBS And I had a very strange occasion when I was invited as a guest workshop leader to do some work on listening skills at the Tabi in London for the course of the child psychotherapist, in the… coming to the end of their second year when they had the opportunity to invite people of their own choosing. Someone had heard of me and of my development of these listening skills courses from other work that I done with clinical psychologist. And I found myself, I’m back to Tabi where I also trained them many years before and working with these second year students. And as the day progressed, I have to say there was some opposition from one of their course leaders that seemed to me to be opposition to what I was doing. But nevertheless, as the day progressed and the students clearly were enjoying it and I think lot of the exercises I developed are very enjoyable exercises to do to. What became quite clear to the students was that they were learning about things, which they had never been taught though they had observed. So in their observation, rather the people working, they had seen these things and hopefully they had modeled themselves on these things. But no one had ever set them down in black and white. And that actually was a sort of naming your particular skills. And for my money all psychodynamic training must start with those skills. 

00:26:10
FRANK WILLS Umm…Umm… 

00:26:10
MICHAEL JACOBS You know, it’s absolutely essential you learn to listen. And… I think, it’s one of the things that Freud learnt very early on when someone said to him; “For goodness sake will you stop asking questions and listen to what I’m saying.” 

00:26:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah, umm…umm… 

00:26:25
MICHAEL JACOBS And I’m not sure whether other psychodynamic courses do it, but I have a funny feeling that many of them do. They go straight into the ideas and into high-flame concepts and so on. And the only training that people have is by modeling themselves on their therapists, that their therapist is a good therapist, fine. And if their therapist are not good therapist and not, haven’t got good sensitive skills, and some don’t in any orientation, then of course the modeling is repeated, the mistakes are repeated as they go on. 

00:27:00
FRANK WILLS I was going to come at you (inaudible ) that that book was particularly packed with pretty punchy sort of exercises and you know and of course another one of your books Insight and Experience also has some very well… 

00:27:15
MICHAEL JACOBS Yes it is very sad, yeah, it seems a lot of people, lots of people don't still want that but it’s (crosstalk)(inaudible), that’s a great shame. I always like to feel that you get some of that back in, because that’s got some really fun exercises and it’s punchy but there is also quite a lot of fun in them as well, right. I think the element of play is actually very important in training you see. 

00:27:35
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… Okay! (crosstalk)(inaudible). Yeah! So I was going to comment that you partly mentioned it already but you know this does seem unusual, the idea of listening skills, exercises and in quite a few psychotherapy school they haven’t done lot that in the past. So I was wondering how that went down with some of your colleagues? I mean, anymore you can tell me about that it is a bit of opposition with that. 

00:28:05
MICHAEL JACOBS Well I’m not, I’m not aware whether I have hit position or not on the whole. I mean, at the… I don’t think the Swift to Hear book is very much used. I think Still Small Voice is occasionally used in some psychodynamic training. I suspect the one that’s used more often is the Psychodynamic Counseling in Action and the Presenting Past. Well I think there are some psychodynamic trainings which wouldn’t touch my work with a bargepole, it about the simplistic probably. And they want to go for all the big names and they will go for cline and (inaudible ) and Freud and so on. And they weren’t… I mean, I don’t think my books appear on their reading list. I mean, it was interesting I did have comment once and I went to identify the place. But when psychodynamic counseling connection came out somebody said, I won't use that book because of course the case histories are fictional. Well, they may be fictional and they needed to be fictional because I was gonna produce long case histories without I think destroying the relationship between client and counselor, but they were very regal. 

00:29:15
FRANK WILLS Yes, I’d like to ask you about some of those in a moment, but some… In a way I quite liked some of the comments on my own here and to say a bit of a hurray for counseling because as you may know I myself trained in cognitive therapy and one of the things that I noticed was that in my own training was that you know quite a few people from other professions actually didn’t seem to have a skill learning tradition and frankly often didn’t seem that interpersonally skilled when they were doing the work. And I think it’s one of the really good achievements that we’ve actually done within the counseling field you know to gulp people with that very good interpersonal skills base. And I think personally it makes them into much better, you know cognitive therapist and I has it the things you would (crosstalk)(inaudible) the thing you would be psychodynamic. 

00:30:10
MICHAEL JACOBS Well no I think. I would… I think that’s often right. And I think it is interesting. I guess, I made that reference to the fact my book might not be used, but I think lots of psychodynamic counseling courses might use them. And I doubt very much where the psychoanalytic and psychotherapy courses use them and yet I think they’re just as relevant there. And I suspect that some of the best therapists, the ones who have trained as counselors first and then gone on to psychoanalytic training afterwards. But they have got that really good base, and much to be said for the counselors, no I don’t want to run down all psychotherapists. I have no appraisal counselors, the whole things and mixtures in it. 

00:30:45
FRANK WILLS Absolutely, yeah! Okay, can we talk a little bit about you know how your psychodynamic work developed and you know your training, starting with your training. You referred to your analysis in one of the books. 

00:31:00
MICHAEL JACOBS Well I'm one of those people who started at a time when of course there was no, virtually no training for counselors. There was a course at Kiel(ph) and I think there was a course somewhere down this part of the world too, for teaches and maybe I think these courses were often for teachers, training and counselors. 

00:31:25
FRANK WILLS I think it may have been here. 

00:31:25
MICHAEL JACOBS Of course it was over here. 

00:31:30
FRANK WILLS There was one here in the 70’s, in the early 70’s. 

00:31:35
MICHAEL JACOBS And the training I received has already be very scanned I have to say. And when I started counseling I had no, virtually no training at all. But I was supervised and that was the training in itself of course. I was supervised by somebody who trained as a psychotherapist. And I also attended seminars and case conferences at the Student Health Service, University of Sussex, which was run those days by Tony Ryle. So I had very brittle hands on practical experience then which I think, I suspect is always the best way of learning. And when I got my job, which would never happen these days, when I got my job at Nester, they said, yes we will take you, but we think you need some training, better you got some promise potential, I think you need some training. So what they feel training (inaudible ) clinical psychology course down there. I wasn’t a clinical psychologist either, I was the only one little knot on it. 

00:32:35
FRANK WILLS Right, right. 

00:32:40
MICHAEL JACOBS I feel quite out at sea. And at that same time my supervisor in Nester recommended that I have therapy and you can have therapy done (inaudible ) while you are there and she found me a therapist who was a very good therapist and analyst, very good model I think. I mean, I think if you want to look sometimes (inaudible ) the way in which we develop our skills it’s often by modeling and we will model on our teachers of course if our teachers teaches the skills and we will model those. But we creating a model for our supervisors and our therapist too and very good therapist. A very sort of warm, human person who was not the stereotypical analyst, which I think is often a label, it is a stereotype. And so I had that training well after two years. Well, you know I just about sort of fulfill, I suppose the, you know I just more than fulfilled the BACP requirements for therapy. But I really didn’t fulfill requirements for any of the psychotherapy courses of therapy which I myself had run. And my training period was very limited. But I had supervision twice a week as well one time and I did have the job and I had that for something like 6 to 7 years twice a week. It’s a lot and again I go back to it. I think this is very practical training is the way in which I learned. So that’s how I started. 

00:34:15
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… (inaudible ) thinking that your analyst also wrote the fairly well… 

00:34:20
MICHAEL JACOBS You know it’s a very… 

00:34:20
FRANK WILLS …developmental task. 

00:34:20
MICHAEL JACOBS Yes human development which I think come into a third edition, may be now fourth edition yes, yes and an influential text and at it’s latest time. I’m not sure whether it still is, but it’s certainly one that I always used on courses where I taught for a very long time and that’s correct. 

00:34:40
FRANK WILLS And you know the developmental stages did come into your writing quite strongly didn't they? 

00:34:50
MICHAEL JACOBS Well, yes, I mean his is a very much a chronological model. I’m not sure how far the developmental model in the sense that I have had to be back and look at it again actually. But he is very much middle, what we call middle group. So he is neither, so I did (inaudible ) somewhere sort of drawing upon the best of both. I would also drawing up on the best of the middle group of which he was clearly contributed to. I mean, his own originality of thinking and we were talking about Eric Rayner I should say. I would say in case people need to know and his book Human Development. So that’s a chronological account more than anything else. But actually I think it’s interesting if I… I think I'm right I think you that by the time it gets to a third edition, he is dotting around a lot more too between the ages and now the model which I first used was the Erickson model. And of course that was… that was spelt at another book, which was quite popular in the 80’s but I love called the Growth of Personality, I think it was. And it was that where he was in a sort of expansion of Erikson’s eight age model. And I… That was representing pastry, that came out of my teaching of course on personality development and Erikson being used as the main thing. But as it went on, I began to get dissatisfied with the stage model for exactly the same reason that I was initially dissatisfied with the whole notion of labeling and that is that if you are not careful and your thinking is put into boxes and the Erikson’s game interestingly is diagrammatically boxes, series of boxes that go up in descending order. And I don’t want to make quote on this is what should be happening at this stage in terms of psychological development and if it doesn’t happen in this stage then there are gonna be problems later in life and then clearly that this problem relates that adult problem relate to the age when they must have been three or four or something. I mean, all that is terribly rigid thinking and it’s very interesting because it was thinking which was typical in the 80’s. I mean, when I was writing, in the 70’s and 80’s many of the books coming out then were about stage theory of one sort or another. And so by the time I came to the mid 90’s, I really wasn’t happy without any longer just didn’t worth wash. I mean, it was partly that the fact it didn’t wash actually with… Mainly I suppose it doesn’t wash with experience, it doesn’t wash when you are in the consulting room. It is not that clear cut, so that’s how I chased that. 

00:37:25
FRANK WILLS You kind of modified little bit… You didn’t entirely abandon it, did you? 

00:37:25
MICHAEL JACOBS I didn’t abandon it and I’m not sure like you’re right I modified a bit. I think I modified it radical loss. But… So what I was saying was I think Erikson has identified some very key issues in the development of human personality and character. But that to locate those specifically within certain ages, chronological ages is a mistake. And although it may be true that certain aspects are stronger at certain ages, so that there are clearly issues about trust and actually one we need not have the word attachment in early infancy and there are clearly issues about authority or autonomy that arise as a child begins to develop a power, both the will power but also muscular power. And though there are clearly issues that arise to do with sexuality particularly in the teens because that there is hopes of puberty. But may be around three or four or two, nevertheless these issues run right the way through life. And there are always issues about trust and attachment throughout life. There are always issues about authority and autonomy, sexuality and so on right the way through. And the issues that appear later in life, no do with generativity and all sorts of things that Erikson talked about, these actually can be seen in intimacy. I mean, it doesn’t appear when you are 21, intimacy is back there at the breast. So, in that sense what I was wanting to say was, don’t be tied down, see these ideas as flowing around, you know wherever they may be they may be useful. 

00:39:15
FRANK WILLS I wonder with something like that you know that one of the reasons may be why Erikson’s work had an impact because it was probably I think a slight paucity of ideas and people work in the field always want to grab hold of ideas and when there is only a fewer around they may be grab on to those ideas, but now we’re in a very different situation. It’s almost too many ideas perhaps. 

00:39:40
MICHAEL JACOBS Well, there are too many books I think. But, I mean, there are too many books simply because publishers are wanting to milk this particular phenomenon that’s around. But let they go on be… Let there go on being lots and lots of ideas. 

00:39:55
FRANK WILLS Let a thousand of flowers bloom. 

00:40:00
MICHAEL JACOBS Umm… I… I… 

00:40:00
FRANK WILLS But maybe 119. 

00:40:00
MICHAEL JACOBS I think… I think you see it is possible that Erickson(ph) obviously filled a gap. I mean the… he was saying certain things in the 50s about identity, which actually were… actually it's logically very important too and I think after two world wars, there was a struggle for who are we, what is… you know that… that he must kind of take that into account. 

00:40:20
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:40:25
MICHAEL JACOBS But also what he did was clearly expand (inaudible ) emphasis on the early childhood years and… and avoid emphasis on adolescence if she has an additional emphasis on adolescence. And he expands and takes it into… into adult life too. I think that that was very important. But I think one of the other problems is and this is… applies always is that when we are learning, we like to have things clear-cut. We like to think you know it's… we can very quickly assimilate ideas and put them into a framework, which means we can remember them easily perhaps for exams that (inaudible ) these days because on the whole when I have to write off the top of my head that way. Umm… but it’s reassuring. It’s terribly reassuring to have those ideas clearly stated black and white, one move to another to another to another. That’s there. Now I think that probably still applies now. Some people still will read Erickson(ph) and be delighted that they have such a scheme. Some people will read some of my books and think they’ve got a scheme out of it. Umm… And they will misinterpret me by making it too rigid. So I think as we… as we develop, I mean if you want to think about it in terms of my development, what my development has been… has been first of all to align myself with one discipline which is theology and then to begin to question it and then actually begin to say well, actually that's not the discipline I really want to study, I want to study psychoanalysis. Then psychoanalysis becomes for me something which has got holy answers, fantastic and I found them at last. Theology let me down, psychoanalysis got them and now I think no, I'm not sure it's got holy answers after all. 

00:42:10
FRANK WILLS (inaudible ). 

00:42:11
MICHAEL JACOBS And then you begin to question and then you begin to become your own person and I heard them, yeah. I would like to think. That's what (inaudible ). 

00:42:20
FRANK WILLS I wonder Michael if we can just for a short while focusing on some of the psychodynamic ideas. 

00:42:25
MICHAEL JACOBS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:42:25
FRANK WILLS And if you don't mind, go to a particular piece of text which I found interesting. And I… I… I introduce it if I may by saying that we've already referred to your use of fictional characters and one of the things that you do in psychodynamic counseling and action is to use two fictional course… characters from Dickens(ph) and to take him through you know a sequence of therapy and you said you do that partly to avoid the problem that identifying clients and I have to say it’s very interesting to read and very convincing. And I'm going to focus on the first sentence, which you spent quite a lot of time deconstructing, reflecting on in the book. When umm… the character, the woman character, who is based on the Dickens character little now(ph), although you renamed it, Dorothy, was it? 

00:43:25
MICHAEL JACOBS No, no, Hannah. 

00:43:25
FRANK WILLS Hannah sorry Hannah, yes, umm… that who you renamed… 

00:43:30
MICHAEL JACOBS (inaudible ). 

00:43:31
FRANK WILLS Right. (inaudible ). 

00:43:35
MICHAEL JACOBS (inaudible ). 

00:43:36
FRANK WILLS Okay. 

00:43:36
MICHAEL JACOBS Umm… 

00:43:36
FRANK WILLS We're leaving that one now. Okay. And Hannah opens the therapy by saying to you, oh, you’re a psychoanalyst. 

00:43:45
MICHAEL JACOBS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:43:45
FRANK WILLS And you use this question and… and I have to say that you might explain as a therapist umm… you know people do relatively often open with questions like that. So we are in a very good area, an useful area to look at. And umm… obviously a therapist in that situation is faced with a number of different options in the way they can respond. One could be to say no, I'm not a psychotherapist, I’m whatever, oh, yes, I’m… (inaudible ) and… and answer the question factually. What you do or what you choose to do is you choose to use the principle of abstinence. Am I right? Is that the term that you use in… in psychoanalysis of umm… not answering the question directly but in a way putting it back to the client and you say I think something like I'm interested in why you are interested in what if I'm a psychotherapist and so you… 

00:44:50
MICHAEL JACOBS Psychoanalyst. 

00:44:50
FRANK WILLS Sorry psychoanalyst. So it kind of opens it out and it… it then progresses into some of heart fears about psychoanalysis and you are then able to umm… reflect the transference in this case, possibly initial transference about thought about fully being projected on to you. Yes? 

00:45:20
MICHAEL JACOBS Oh about men actually. 

00:45:20
FRANK WILLS About men and yes and… 

00:45:20
MICHAEL JACOBS Men and fairly clearly writing about men and sex. 

00:45:25
FRANK WILLS (inaudible ) sex, yeah. Now umm… I have to say that umm… that is not something that I would do. Umm… and as a therapist, I think kind of I would answer the question and I would note somewhere that there is an issue here, but I… I wouldn't necessarily open it out at that point. And you know but… but having said that, you know that's what I would do and it's probably more personal information to answer any theoretical stance. But you know you do make quite a persuasive case about why it is helpful to… to put the question back and how this leads into some new area in a way how more it’s like to slip out I think you know (inaudible ) expression more of the anxiety and concerns like to speak slip out. However, I… I personally was quite pleased with you for answering a question not long after. 

00:46:25
MICHAEL JACOBS Oh yes, that’s right. Hmm…Hmm… 

00:46:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. Umm… and it does… I sometimes feel that kind of… that way of dating with people almost going to be quite cruel actually. And so and… and I felt that what you did was sort of you know was… you know you did see, you… you… you did what sort of seems like helpful maneuver, but you know you didn't clear the agony sort of going for… 

00:46:50
MICHAEL JACOBS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:46:55
FRANK WILLS …for longer than most necessary and so that's… that's my reaction to that. 

00:47:00
MICHAEL JACOBS Yes, yes, I'm not… I'm not sure that I would class that particular one as agony. And I think what would have been agonizing for Hannah in that instance would… would have been as you said he was psychoanalyst and I just didn’t say anything and that would have been as it were true abstinence… 

00:47:15
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:47:15
MICHAEL JACOBS …would be that not saying anything at all and umm… you know there is again that stereotype but I think it is true of some analysts that they do not say anything. Umm… (inaudible ) until they are ready to say something, which they hope will be helpful. And umm… So… So I… I think to say you know I'm interested in what (inaudible ) question. And it’s a two(ph) tone of voice as well, I mean to say why you ask that would be terribly aggressive… 

00:47:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:47:45
MICHAEL JACOBS …and threatening that. I’m interesting in why… why you ask that question. Actually it doesn't preclude that I’m going to answer it. Umm… it… what it’s saying is just… just explore it. What does that mean? What does psychoanalyst mean to you? Now I… I don't find that threatening and I would hope that she doesn't find that threatening. Umm… and what I am interested in is, what does this mean? Now you are quite right. There would have been other ways doing it. And one possibility would have been the one that you suggested and that is to just say yes or no and that in this case would be no, I’m not a psychotherapist, I’m a counselor. But still I would then add what does that mean to you, because I'm still interested in what that was about or the alternative would have been to say, anything less, so I was less, less happy with it, but no I'm not and left it. 

00:48:40
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:48:40
MICHAEL JACOBS No, no, I'm not. It would have been… it could have been interpreted as, oh, that's very quick, right, what will I say next. Actually what I've done is responded to it you see and… 

00:48:50
FRANK WILLS Umm… 

00:48:50
MICHAEL JACOBS …I've got into a conversation about this, which actually seems to be much more umm… 

00:49:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:49:00
MICHAEL JACOBS …conducive to developing something. Then… then just say no, though I cannot see also the point that you say about sometimes you hear something and you just (inaudible ), I think much interesting. I might come back to that later. That might be valuable later or something might be said later that throws light on that. 

00:49:20
FRANK WILLS Umm… Yeah. 

00:49:20
MICHAEL JACOBS I will… I may find myself doing that frequent in sessions or somebody will start or something say something, often quite innocuous. Umm… and I think the key things to remember it have an exercise(ph) first and last words, ut remember it and later on I might find myself kind of back to it and say it’s interesting, isn't it, that we’re talking about this now and earlier and when we were starting the session, you said that I think there’s somewhere a link between those two things. 

00:49:50
FRANK WILLS You know so actually I got a few options from the… 

00:49:50
MICHAEL JACOBS Yes there are and…and… 

00:49:50
FRANK WILLS …one more that… 

00:49:50
MICHAEL JACOBS … there are and I'm… I'm open to all those options. 

00:49:55
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:49:55
MICHAEL JACOBS And I think in the book, the… the reason I use that particular form there is that I want to illustrate just how valuable it is… 

00:50:00
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:50:05
MICHAEL JACOBS Not to answer questions straightaway, but to answer the question later seems to me to be right. 

00:50:10
FRANK WILLS Umm… Yes, yeah, yeah. And if I can say word for cognitive therapy here, one of… one of… it attributes that I find helpful in understanding these kind of situations is that it would suggest to us that the person would perceive and any maneuver therapist might make and according to that beliefs, values and current thinking… 

00:50:35
MICHAEL JACOBS Hmm… 

00:50:35
FRANK WILLS …state. And umm… of course you know some… some people and even if you ask in a most gentle form, would… some people would think oh I said, something wrong. 

00:50:50
MICHAEL JACOBS Yes, yeah. 

00:50:50
FRANK WILLS And… 

00:50:50
MICHAEL JACOBS It’s a good example of what call transference. 

00:50:50
FRANK WILLS And I… and not takes us into to ah… what would be the way that client interprets things there, but it also another big area within… within umm… psychodynamic work is interpretation I found what you wrote about that very interesting. You'll, you're quite strong, I would say on the dangers of what we might call premature 

00:51:10
MICHAEL JACOBS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:51:15
FRANK WILLS …umm… interpretation. And umm… ah… I I think I’m… I and personally find a piece… piece, it’s a of (inaudible )message work… 

00:51:26
MICHAEL JACOBS Yeah, I think. 

00:51:26
FRANK WILLS And helpful in that… 

00:51:26
MICHAEL JACOBS Yes, yes. (inaudible ) The limits are to projection. 

00:51:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. And so, can you say a little bit more about that about interpretation when its useful and… and… and when it can be not useful? 

00:51:40
MICHAEL JACOBS Well it, I suppose. It goes back just in… just in this conversation that we are having, we’ve got a nice little impact to and to your referred to my earliest article and whole thing that naming and labeling, because umm… there is… I think I do actually said in that book that there that, that if we say something we need to say it to the point to which someone is ready to recognize it. And that refers to labeling, which would also refers to the whole thing about what's called interpretation. Now, the… the… the stereotypical notion of… of psychoanalysis is that to the patient lies down on the couch and free associates, and then that after a while and probably, to a… towards the end of the session, umm… the analyst who is sitting behind the couch and maybe or maybe not making notes. At that point, who then comes out with his startling interpretation, which suddenly make sense of everything the… the patient to be saying. Well, I think that's probably a stereotype, but I'd been interested here for anybody who has experienced that, umm… certainly wasn't true. My therapies that I mean they had the startling interpretations that would come out with… ah… ah… at when I… when I finish to speaking. Umm… but there… you do read them, I mean you read… you read them in the books. Unfortunately, and there where I would find evidence you know if I’ve read some client's work, I'm not, I find her interpreting left, right and center, what child children play with me and it's… well, maybe she was right. But it doesn't look that obvious when you are reading the book what it looks like is her putting an interpretation upon it, which is her own interpretation in the light of own theory Umm… And umm… is not actually, ah… ah… clearly demonstrable to someone who doesn't work within that theory. And it's also true, I think I read some, some essays of certain people about having the training with the psychotherapists or case studies. And I find it wild interpretation has being made. Now, they’re not necessarily being made to the client, but they are being made in that about what this means and so on. Where is the evidence sort of and so on? So, I'm very critical of that notion whether it's stereotypical or not but, if it is, if even if it isn't, let's get rid of it. Umm… of, of, of thinking I know better and that I… that I can tell the client what all this means. (inaudible ) interestingly enough uses the term construction and sort of interpretation and… and he makes it fairly clear in a paper that he went on constructions that it’s something you know very rarely is, that you… you… you… you very occasionally, you will construct, reconstruct as it will and we might put it in a… in a… in a more… more modern turnaround. We… we reconstruct what a person has been saying linking it and experiencing it with some, with other aspects that’s there. So… so… I'm… I'm… I'm, what I don't want to do the force interpretations about people. And on the other hand, it does seem to me that if you build up the right relationship to someone which let us think in terms of that rely relationship being one where the client can actually disagree with you and that seems to be turn important they can. If you know they can disagree with you, it does seem to me to be much more possible to say you know I'm, I'm really, I'm not at all short about this, but I wonder whether this would be helpful and then to put an idea in and to the best, you can do, you can see what the client’s reaction is that what you are talking. You know, I'm not obviously wrong there, or if I'm a little bit right that you know, that seems to me to be the way in which one will use sometimes they mould wild ideas that you have at the right point with the right client and in such a way that the client can disagree, readily disagree without any fear or rework it in a way that make sense to them. 

00:55:40
FRANK WILLS I wonder if I can, I can say that too into the same idea, I think into another very important area about the therapist or relationship… 

00:55:50
MICHAEL JACOBS Umm… 

00:55:50
FRANK WILLS …and transference… 

00:55:50
MICHAEL JACOBS Umm… 

00:55:50
FRANK WILLS …and, and one, one area that interest me quite a bit and I think it's you know sometimes misunderstood in all size, is this idea that's and the client's problem are replayed within the… in the therapeutic group and relationship. So, for example, if they have the history of mistrust and relationship that's may well reflect itself within…in the therapeutic and relationship and, and, again there are, there are, there are sort of you know a text which gives you one wonderfully inspiring examples of this being used in a very helpful way, but it does also from my perspective, and I think, I think, you acknowledge the way you are suppose to makes me think that you probably agree me on this, but I stand to be corrected. Is that, umm…you know it's also possible that actually an incident that's happening in therapy is not related to the client's previous programs, you know that is actually something this between you and… 

00:57:00
MICHAEL JACOBS Umm… 

00:57:00
FRANK WILLS …including sometimes, you are actually doing something wrong. 

00:57:00
MICHAEL JACOBS Oh! Quite right yeah. 

00:57:05
FRANK WILLS You know and, and… 

00:57:05
MICHAEL JACOBS Umm… 

00:57:05
FRANK WILLS …I think that such an important thing and, and again it comes back and really to the, I guess the powerful position the therapist is potentially in to call the shots, to define reality about that what's going on. 

00:57:20
MICHAEL JACOBS I know, I, I, I, absolutely agree with you and it's that your thinking than we, we won’t mind, but if your interpretation what I've written you know is absolutely writing on the wall and, and I think there is one thing to say about transference first of all but that's the only actually want to that other aspect and that is, that, that have often the way in which transference is written about is, is as if, the relationship that a client has with the therapist is one which is totally a picture of a transfer relationship from somewhere else. In other words, you know it is, it is as if, if there is a transference of a relationship to a parent as if that therapist in all respects and has become apparent. I think that's a totally wrong notion umm… what we have to do again is to say to ourselves, umm…as one client said to me once that you know every now and again just occasionally, I see you are just like my father. I thought that was actually a perfect definition of transference. Not all the time… 

00:58:25
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:58:30
MICHAEL JACOBS …but every now and again… 

00:58:30
FRANK WILLS Umm… 

00:58:30
MICHAEL JACOBS …I see just like that, I mean with the same age. There is no written way, but I was, but, but she saw it. I have never mentioned that, I don't think… 

00:58:35
FRANK WILLS Umm…Hmm… 

00:58:40
MICHAEL JACOBS …Umm…and, and the, I felt that, I think that's the first thing about transference, but the second thing is you are absolutely right that umm…much that goes on, actually goes on not within and this not part of a transferred relationship, but it's actually part of what's going on between two people. Umm…and that relationship has it's own history, it's builds up it's own history and there is nothing, there may be the things to transfer from the beginning of the history to another point of the history, but it isn't to do so much with the outside just to do with the inside what's going on there. And that sometimes to do with mistakes, but of course, but actually sometimes to do with some very good work and so that a good relationship being built up between a therapist and, and, and a client, is, is actually something which they then begin to internalize, and it's very important to them as well. And I mean, I had an example recently writing with someone who had clearly experienced quite a lot of damage in the course of a number, of one particular therapeutic relationship and, and, and, what seemed to see to be clear there was that the damage was caused not by things being transferred into that relationship from outside although something was around but it was never got at because the relationship itself went so wrong that there was no chance of getting back to whatever it was to be important in the first place. And Lanx(ph), who is an American psychoanalyst who has developed something called communicative psychotherapy. And in this country it has been written by probably best written about him by a man called David Livingstone Smith who has now gone back to America. But Lanx(ph), with whom I’d disagree in many ways, but one of the things he has pulled out is that when clients speak to us they’re often speaking in a disguised coded way about the relation between the analyst and the patient, the therapist and the client, the counselor and the client. And that… You need also always to be listening to every communication as first being about that. And only when you are sure there is not about you and then, do you then begin to think about of being about something else. And I think he is right. Although the way he then applies that I think goes over the top. 

01:01:05
FRANK WILLS I mean, taking this back to the idea of premature interpretation, I remember that one of the things that, helpful things that a psychodynamic colleague said to me once was that, you know if you notice something there is some little by-play going on within the therapy. And though that is something to notice but not necessary to act on, and it’s only ready if you kept noticing that and then we’re able to reflect on what might done that you would then be movement to make interpretation. I mean, it does, I have to say that it does seem to me something about the way people learn, initially learn psychoanalytic and psychodynamic ideas which almost encourages them to rush in and interpret. 

01:02:00
MICHAEL JACOBS Well that’s right. And I think… 

01:02:05
FRANK WILLS Probably because the ideas are so exiting, I think. 

01:02:05
MICHAEL JACOBS I think it… I think it was partly what is it. I think it's partly because it very reassuring to think that you're the expert. You know that you give people answers. I mean, let’s realign them to the clients looking with that and to give them something and it’s dangerous because unless they consider themselves they may then swallow it and believe it without actually having found it for themselves, even if it’s right. So I think that… I think that… I think that’s right. I think I would also want to say about, it is this that one of the problems about overwriting, and of course we get many of our ideas from books as I mentioned earlier, in clients books, but one of the problems at writing is that you also crystallize out the best movements in it. 

01:02:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:02:45
MICHAEL JACOBS And what you don’t do is to show the hours that had gone on with that you say anything. 

01:02:50
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:02:50
MICHAEL JACOBS Because that would be very boring, yeah. And so it looks as if one is an expert, because you come out with example after example of this being right, but for every example that was right, there were probably 99 interventions which were nothing to do with interpretation at all. They were simply moving in some way or another the conversation, the narrative alone. And for everyone that was right, there were probably three that were wrong. And… But they don’t get written about us. I do say in one of my book, I think there is a wonderful thing that one of my tutors at Tari said was, you know we…we…we we teach by our best examples we learn by our mistakes. 

01:03:30
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

01:03:35
MICHAEL JACOBS And that is also to the supervisors of course you see, so that a supervisor, within the psychodynamic traditions, psychoanalytic tradition a supervisor will be wanting to try and interpret what’s going on. Now, in a supervisory relationship of course those interpretations can be made, they’re not going back to straight to the client who you trust, though I have heard examples where they’ve gone completely undigested. That’s a recline. But nevertheless, there is the supervisor saying, oh I think we may have to understand this in that way. Now, what the supervisor essentially doing is actually speculating upon the information that supervisor has. But if you’re learning of course you think, oh that’s the way it must be done. So I think that the… it’s… we really need to see and that is where ones own therapy comes into interaction. You really need to see how the therapist really work. And one of the things that Peter Lomas says of course in his work is that no one really knows what goes on in the consulting room. Because actually no one in that honest about what goes on in the consulting room. It’s not that there is something… anything immoral going on, but we don’t know all the mistakes that are made the hours of listening the four things I said which are actually useful in time, so. 

01:04:50
FRANK WILLS I mean, somebody once said to me actually a thing about psychotherapy is, it’s actually quite boring a lot of the time. Would you agree with that? 

01:04:55
MICHAEL JACOBS No, no I don’t agree with your point at all. No, I think it’s boring to read about, you know that’s perhaps the same thing I’m saying. But I don’t think it’s boring, there are some people with whom there is that boredom. And I have just to you know ask myself at that point is that my tiredness at the end of a long day or is it is something that’s seemed to this person that’s there. But that’s actually interesting thing, when I start begin to ask those questions inside myself, then I may begin, no it still stays, it stay alive for me, so not get caught in that, too much in that (inaudible ). Well I think for the most part it is fascinating and it’s fascinating for both parties, well in rather different ways. But it isn’t readily put into a transcript and transcripts can be very boring things to read. 

01:05:50
FRANK WILLS Okay, we’re starting to run out of time now, there are still a couple of things that I would like to try and try and cover with you if I could. And really they are things that come out if your… your two books for the modern masters series, one on Winnie Cotton one on Freud. I think you are probably the only person who has written on two of them. 

01:06:05
MICHAEL JACOBS I am, yes. 

01:06:05
FRANK WILLS That must be kind feather in your cap. And then I'd also like to just end after that end up just by bringing it right up to date and you telling me what you’re doing now. But if… I’m sorry to have to you know pick out very small bits from these two works which are, you know really great and helpful in coverage of these very big topics. But one thing that was completely new to me and from reading the Freud book, which I found very interesting was the story that you tell about one of his clients telling him basically to stop interpreting and listen to what I’m saying. And one of the things that struck me about that was that it parallels the story that Carl Rogers(ph) tells about how he came to person such a counseling somebody said to him, look I’m fed up with what you're saying to me. Can I tell you in my own words. 

01:07:05
MICHAEL JACOBS Yes. 

01:07:05
FRANK WILLS And also it’s reflected somewhat in Aaron Beckson(ph) work as well where in a early experience of a client and while he was trying to apply one idea and this client persistently was telling him something else. And I felt that it was, you know just a very interesting view of Freud which is probably very much against the usually stereotype. 

01:07:30
MICHAEL JACOBS Well it is. I mean, that what's… what I felt Freud was a fascinating person. And of course there were movements and I say it in the book when I think that he made the sort of interpretations that we were referring to earlier. But in those very early days for start it does seem to me that what he constantly was corrected by, was willing to be corrected by his patients. And he learnt something very, very important from those very early practices which of course laid the foundation for his work. And unfortunately of course what got lost was how he learnt that and the techniques and all that, because it then got set down, but not in terms of technique it all got set down in terms of the theories, the ideas about human personality behind all that. And interestingly enough, the papers that he wrote on technique which come much later are ones which weren’t published in the Penguin edition, because it was thought it was right that the public should learn about what Freud’s technique was about. I mean, it was amazingly patronizing of the editors of that edition. And they are fortunately out of the new Penguin classics edition that’s come out in brilliant translations. Now… The other thing about Freud was that he went on learning throughout his life. I mean, constantly questioning his own ideas. I mean, he is a real model for me, if you want to look at somebody who is always questioning his ideas. And unfortunately as Erich Fromm says of Freud, his followers actually didn’t, they just followed them often they’re much lesser men Fromm says than Freud was, and they just carried on the teaching as it were, like your puzzles gone carrying on the teaching of Jesus almost. You know we’ve got to stay with the words of Freud, but actually he’s written so much, so that you could build up all sorts of different pictures. So that’s the great thing about Freud, that…that…that I think people don’t recognize is how often he changes his mind, qualifies what you’ve said and so on. Even though, I suspect as a therapist he begot to a point where he thought he knew what was going on for people at least it does read that way in some of his cases. And I think perhaps overdid it a bit but he thinks… 

01:09:50
FRANK WILLS And there is lot of politics where he could… 

01:09:50
MICHAEL JACOBS Well, there is huge amount of politics then come into as well. 

01:09:55
FRANK WILLS Therapeutic politics. 

01:09:55
MICHAEL JACOBS Yes, that’s right. But, yes, rivalry and those sorts of things going on, you know, which you, wouldn’t go on with a… within a group of people who are meant to know themselves, but we’re all doing it today. 

01:10:10
FRANK WILLS And Winnie Cotton(ph) of course a very different sort of figure, much more diffident man and I briefly mentioned to you before the occasional stories his about his own analysis with (inaudible ), sorry which apparently led you know is a very long about 2000 sessions or so it is estimated. I find it quite hard to mention what they would be talking about on the 2000 session with you? 

01:10:45
MICHAEL JACOBS Well I would because I’ve never experienced myself either as I said earlier. And I think a lot of psychoanalytic therapists would say it’s a huge weakness in me and they would dismiss everything I don’t… as result to it. I mean, it is unfortunately the pattern of training in psychoanalytic psychotherapy that you do have to have this intensive therapy that goes on for such a long time. 

01:11:05
FRANK WILLS The training analysis? 

01:11:05
MICHAEL JACOBS The training analysis, yes. And I have to say that my experience of practicing analysis, practicing therapy rather I've never practiced analysis, my experience of practicing it is that, there is a lot of diminishing returns. And that you might do very well for the rest ten sessions with huge amount of insight whether you get quite a lot of insight in the first 100 sessions but after that it really is a matter of going on working over the all material. Now actually five times a week or four times a week analysis is very different and clearly what does happen is that people are able to engage in a sort of revelry of just talking about what comes out… comes into their mind. And unfortunately I think one of the things happens is that the analysis dominates the lives in the 23 hours between the next session. They’re full of next things that are going to be talking about so I personally don’t see that once a week therapy can’t be just as effective for the majority of people. I have to say that very clearly. And I would long for someone to come up with the evidence that three times a week, five years is more effective, than once a week for five years, let’s put it that way, would someone (inaudible ), because I once asked on an internet forum, could somebody provide me with the evidence that this is actually effective. And there was no one who could provide any reference at all. So, but I’m fine that’s part of it, but when it got before with somebody who is very good at practicing short work… 

01:12:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:12:40
MICHAEL JACOBS …I mean, either thousands of children and parents of children he worked with, just in one or few, two sessions sometimes. I mean, he had that the gift of really getting to something very quickly. Now some people would say of course that came out of this long analysis. I don’t really believe that. 

01:12:55
FRANK WILLS But within your own work what do you… what sort of periods do you find yourself working? 

01:13:05
MICHAEL JACOBS Well now, it’s very, as I’ve gone through different settings where I worked in, and I worked for a long times as I told you earlier as a student counselor. And as a student counselor the average was six sessions. And I think that’s probably true with many student counseling services until the point they begin to put blocks of six on, you know the people restricted often to six. But actually I used to have then people coming at one or two and I used have people three or four years. But average was always six sessions, year after year after year. I then began to work after I left that and went into teaching in a voluntary counseling center. And there the maximum someone could be seen was two years in order to be able to keep the waiting lists happy. And I… That would vary. And assessments would always be carried out, so that when you took someone on, you had a sense of whether this was going to be a year or six weeks, six months, two years. Now I’m in independent practice. And it depends on what people I think need, want. I’m not sure I could actually say what they need, but I can listen to what they want. And I might see somebody for a few sessions, because that’s what they want. And it may be all that they can actually afford in terms of either money or time. I may see somebody for years. But I would be quite concerned if I’m seeing somebody for years, that I’m not holding on to them for the sake of holding on to them. And that at the moment they’re ready to want, they’re ready to go, I can encourage it. They may not want to go, but I think I need to encourage it, because there comes a point I hope when people can stand alone or stand with others not with me. 

01:15:00
FRANK WILLS Okay, so that bring this more of today, you know we didn’t say earlier but you were very much centered on Lester for many years working in the University though and both as a teacher and as a counselor. And I know now you’ve moved to Dorset and I know you’re now the Visiting Professor of counseling is it? 

01:15:20
MICHAEL JACOBS Psychotherapy and counseling. 

01:15:20
FRANK WILLS Psychotherapy and counseling at the University of Bournemouth. So, what are you working on at the present Michael? 

01:15:30
MICHAEL JACOBS Well I have a day week when I see clients. And that’s the exactly the same day, I won’t move it. I think one of the very good things about psychodynamic or psychoanalytic practice is it’s respect for boundaries. And I’m very clear that I’ll not shift unless I can… I mean, if there is something really dramatic I won’t shift that Tuesday. I won’t shift people around. So I have a… I won’t take more than six on, but I’ll see maximum of six on that day. I also sit supervisor at various therapists and counselors and that’s either fortnightly or a monthly basis. If often has to of course fit in with the ACP regulations. I teach on the psychotherapy course almost. I teach one module there, for two hours week. And I teach for the WEA and I teach what I like to do there which is to move into literature and I was saying to you earlier, Shakespeare on the Coach is one of my course I’m developing there to the whole thing about literature and music and analysis and so I’m bringing all these things together. I think that sort of demoralisation of therapy is terribly important, or therapeutic idea. So I do that. I had a quite of number of things I do with BACP, which are mainly based at home, but because I’m on a consultancy work with them. And other things which were correspondence and other things like that. So… And I’m cutting down enormously on any writing, I’ve said enough. But I have actually at the movement having to work on the third edition of presenting past which I will do. But by the time people watch this video may be I doubt they would be out. But I don’t think you’ll see much more from me in the way of writing. Because I enjoy my new job and I work as a Company Secretary for (inaudible ), and well, voluntarily work. And I’m a treasurer for the film festival and various things like that which seems to me… And I watch the coast once a week, for National Coast Watch Institution. So those are the things I’m really getting involved in now, broadening out beyond therapy. 

01:17:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah, so you’re kind of like, you know we’re taking about you know you’re being your own man. 

01:17:50
MICHAEL JACOBS Hmm… 

01:17:50
FRANK WILLS But you’ve really more practically you're own man now as well than your ideas. 

01:17:55
MICHAEL JACOBS Yes I’m holding to no one except my clients. 

01:18:00
FRANK WILLS Well it sounds a quite happy note I think to end on. Michael can I say thank you very much. It’s been fascinating talking to you. I’ve learnt a lot. Right now it’s a bit hazy to me, but I know there are lot of interesting and fascinating things, I mean helpful things that you’ve been saying today. 

01:18:15
MICHAEL JACOBS Well, yes. 

01:18:15
FRANK WILLS Thank you very much. 

01:18:15
MICHAEL JACOBS SBT says it’s always good to talk. 

01:18:20
FRANK WILLS Thank you, yes.

NARRATOR The School of Health and Social Sciences at the University of Wales, Newport is developing a wide range of videos and DVDs aimed at counselors, counseling trainers, their students and at anyone interested in developing the use of communication skills. We offer programs demonstrating good practice and bad practice. We give critics of use of counseling skills. And we explore the way in which those skills can be used in a variety of helping settings. 

01:19:35
I just had a really terrible day today. 

01:19:40
NARRATOR Using a wide range of examples in a informative but light-hearted manner, we look at the ways in which help and support and counseling can be offered, both in face-to-face work and over the telephone. We have also developed a series of programs in which key practitioners discuss their work and ideas. In this series in common with our other materials has been welcomed by many counseling trainers. Whether you are a trainer, a counselor, a student or someone who uses counseling skills as part of their everyday work, we think that we will have something to interest you.
