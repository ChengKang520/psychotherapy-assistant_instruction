Relationship Play Therapy: 

00:00:05
A Clinical Session 

00:00:05
Dr. Clark Moustakas 

00:00:05
UNKNOWN In these series, we are allowed the privilege of seeing the therapist child interaction and feeling the emotions generated in an initial play therapy session with a child. From the moment of entering the playroom, to ending the session. We recognize and applaud the courage of these play therapists in allowing us to videotape their spontaneous interactions with the child. These are not planned experiences. There is no script. They are spontaneous interactions that allow us a unique view into each therapist's typical approach to a child in play therapy. These play therapists were eager to share their experiences in hopes that you will learn more about play therapy, children, and yourself. In this video you will see Doctor Clark Moustakas, founder of relationship play therapy. Doctor Moustakas has long been recognized as one of the leading pioneers in the conceptualization and development of the field of play therapy. He is the founder and president of the center for humanistic studies in Detroit as well as senior consultant and core faculty member in psychology at the Union Institute in Cincinnati. Doctor Moustakas is a prolific writer and includes in his impressive bibliography of over 20 books such notable works as “Psychotherapy with Children,” “Children in Play Therapy,” ”Existential Child Therapy,” and “Relationship Play Therapy.” He describes being with the child as a true interactive process where he is learning and participating at the same time as he's offering himself to the child in a way that's both freeing for the child and energizing for him. According to Doctor Moustakas, patience and waiting on the child are the most significant principles of play therapy. Following the play therapy session, Doctor Moustakas shares his reactions to the experience in an interview with Doctor Gary Landlin, director of the center for play therapy at the university of North Texas. 

00:02:15
UNKNOWN Alrighty then. Oh. 

00:02:20
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS You finding what you need? 

00:02:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. Are these real? 

00:02:30
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS You may need those. Are they real? I don't think so. 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN Cause it said in the playroom that you could unlock Daniel and lock this. I locked Daniel up and he went back here. 

00:02:40
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS You locked Dan up like that? 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:02:45
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS I see. 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN And I got out. I went out of the room. 

00:02:50
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS And you had fun doing that. Okay. Oh you got a key for it too, huh? 

00:03:00
[sil.] 

00:03:05
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Is it gonna work? 

00:03:05
UNKNOWN No. Maybe another key. It ain't working. 

00:03:15
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS  It is? Okay. 

00:03:25
[sil.] 

00:03:30
UNKNOWN Okay. I'm the robber. 

00:03:35
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS You're the robber. Who are you gonna rob? 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN You. 

00:03:40
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Me? Well we'll see how that goes. It just depends on what you mean by robbing and how you're gonna do it. 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN I'm not gonna rob you. I'm gonna steal money off of you. 

00:03:55
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS  Oh that's what you have in mind. 

00:04:00
UNKNOWN No. 

00:04:00
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS That's not what you have in mind. Okay. You're not gonna steal money from me. What type of robbing are you gonna do of me? 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Jump you. Nah. 

00:04:10
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Jump me. 

00:04:10

DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Well let's see. This one doesn't work, does it? I don't think this, this one won't work. You'll need to get the dark gun. And let's see where it is. Not that one. It looks like this one. 

00:05:00
[sil.] 

00:05:05
UNKNOWN Alrighty then.

00:05:10
UNKNOWN Hey where's that bank thing? Yeah. We need it. Okay. 

00:05:20
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS  How come it's not opening? 

00:05:30
[sil.] 

00:05:35
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Maybe it has to be on a different level. Should I try it? Just not functioning today. It's partway open but it won't go all the way. 

00:05:50
UNKNOWN Oh. It's okay. You can just pretend like you have money. 

00:06:00

00:07:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:10
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Would you? It would be okay to shoot me in the foot. 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:07:15
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS If that's what you really wanna do. 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN I'll shoot you in your leg. 

00:07:20
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS I don't know about the leg. I don't know how much, let's try the foot and see what that's like. Oh that was okay. You wanna try the leg? 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN You better get ready. 

00:07:35
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS  That wasn't bad. I can live with that. 

00:07:40

00:07:45
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Alright, you wanna do it again? 

00:07:45

00:08:20
UNKNOWN I'm gonna slice your head off. 

00:08:20
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS  I don't think I'd be okay with that James. 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN  Bye bye. 

00:08:30
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS That would be the end of me. Would you like to get rid of me?

UNKNOWN Thank you. Boom. 

00:09:15
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS You're a robber who says thank you when you take away something. 

00:09:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. Thank, you shouldn't have did that. Cause I'm gonna blow up your head now. 

00:09:25
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Oh that's going too far. You'll have to pretend on that one. What in this room might be my head? Okay.

00:13:35
UNKNOWN There's a big meter there. There we go. 

00:13:40

00:14:55
UNKNOWN I do an operation on you. 

00:14:55
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Oh boy. I was, I was thinking maybe that would be coming next. What kind of operations do you do? 

00:15:10
UNKNOWN I don't know. Heart. 

00:15:15
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Heart? I see. You cut open the chest? Yep. I can see the knife moving. And then? 

00:15:30
UNKNOWN I tear out your heart. 

00:15:30
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS You tear it out? Then you have no heart to live with. Then I would be without a heart. 

00:15:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. This is pretend, I wouldn't do it in real life. 

00:15:45
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Oh. Okay. It would just be pretend. I like that idea. 

00:15:55
UNKNOWN I'll put the band-aids in here. Pretend like I'm... 

00:16:00
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Then I could really stay with you. 

00:16:05
UNKNOWN So you wouldn't be like haunting me? 

00:16:05
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS No. I would be with you. And enjoying things that you create. 

00:16:15

UNKNOWN Uh huh. 

00:16:20
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Tell me about it. 

00:16:20
UNKNOWN Over at Kingswood Apartments. 

00:16:25
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Oh. You dream about those things? 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN No. 

00:16:30
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS No? But you know they exist. 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN Uh huh. Here we go. 

00:16:45
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS You really are enjoying the idea of it. 

00:16:50
UNKNOWN I sure am. 

00:16:50
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Uh huh. And it covers the mouth. 

00:17:00
UNKNOWN You're dead. 

00:17:05
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Completely. 

00:17:05
UNKNOWN I'll make you more dead and tear out your heart. 

00:17:10
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS I'm deader than dead. I'm beyond dead. 

00:17:15
UNKNOWN Okay. Shot. See if he's alive. Blood pressure up. Let's see if his heart's really moving. 

00:17:30
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Have you had hospital visits yourself? 

00:17:30
UNKNOWN  Yeah. 

00:17:35
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS So you know what equipment the doctor uses. 

00:17:35
UNKNOWN I know that they use from our surgery MRIs. 

00:17:45
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Oh that makes a sharp noise on the floor, doesn't it? As if it would cut right through the cement. 

00:17:55
UNKNOWN  Get ready. You gotta close your eyes and drop dead. 

00:18:00
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS I don't know about closing my eyes. I think I'll just keep my, I'll close one. How is that? 

00:18:10
UNKNOWN You're dead. 

00:18:10
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS One eye closed. A one eyed Clark. 

00:18:15
UNKNOWN  Okay. See these kidnappers. 

00:18:20
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS  Ah. What happened? And out the heart goes. 

00:18:30
UNKNOWN You're dead. 

00:18:35
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS I'm dead. 

00:18:35
UNKNOWN I'm gonna make sure you're dead. 

00:18:40
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS If I were really dead, I couldn't be with you here, could I? 

00:18:40
UNKNOWN  Nuh uh. Yes you can but you'd be dead. 

00:18:45
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS And what would it be like for you? To be with a dead man? 

00:18:55
UNKNOWN I don't know. 

00:18:55
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS  You just wouldn't, what? Okay. Taking my blood pressure? 

00:19:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. But I'm checking if you're really dead. 

00:19:10
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS You're not gonna get much pressure, are you, since you took out my heart? There's nothing to pump the blood around. It won't stay. 

00:19:25
UNKNOWN Let me see if it'll stay right here. 

00:19:25
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS You might try on the skin part and not the shirt. Maybe it'll stay there. Here it is, I'm helping you to do this operation. 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN But you're dead. 

00:19:35
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS It probably makes it okay, huh? There you go. 

00:19:50
UNKNOWN That's really high. Well operation's almost done. 

00:19:55
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Almost done. 

00:20:00
UNKNOWN And I blow off your heart from the rest of your body. 

00:20:05
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS  Are you gonna do it? Are you sure? You did it. You got me. 

00:20:20
UNKNOWN Now. 

00:20:25
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Now off goes the hand. 

00:20:25
UNKNOWN The other hand. 

00:20:30
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS And the rest. There isn't anything left of me is there? 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN Almost. What's that? 

00:20:45
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS What? 

00:20:45
UNKNOWN That right there. 

00:20:45
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Is it a microphone like yours? That's what it is. So that my voice goes through also. And let me say this, we have about five more minutes today. 

00:21:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:21:00
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Okay? You did it. 

00:21:05
UNKNOWN Dropped in the air or something. 

00:21:10
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS How do you feel about it? 

00:21:10
UNKNOWN  Good. 

00:21:15
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Good? You enjoy shooting me? 

00:21:15
UNKNOWN  Good shot. 

00:21:20
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Okay. 

00:21:25
UNKNOWN Another thing. Bang. I got you. 

00:21:35
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS I'm going to say this James, one more time. That's it. You've shot me for the last time. 

00:21:45
UNKNOWN I did? 

00:21:45
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Yes. Now you'll need to find another target. I don't want to be shot anymore. 

00:21:50
UNKNOWN  Okay. 

00:21:55
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Okay? You don't wanna shoot any place, anything else? Okay. Alright. Okay. 

00:22:15
[sil.] 

00:22:30
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS That was quite a punch. Series of punches. 

00:22:35
[sil.] 

00:22:45
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Where did you learn to box like that? 

00:22:50
UNKNOWN Brian taught me. 

00:22:55
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Brian? 

00:22:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. He's not my friend anymore. 

00:22:55
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Oh. He was your friend at one time? 

00:23:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:23:00
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS But not anymore. What happened? 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN He's not my friend. 

00:23:05
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS He's just not your friend. 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN He's talking like I'm retarded and everything. 

00:23:10
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Oh. 

00:23:15
[sil.] 

00:23:25
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS James? What I'd like you to do is take the handcuffs off now because we're coming pretty close to ending our session. 

00:23:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:23:35
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Okay? I thank you for that. How about this one? Good. What about this? You got me tied up here. I have an idea. Okay. And it's time for us to go now. 

00:24:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:24:05

00:24:15
An Interview With 

00:24:15
Dr. Clark Moustakas 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN Clark, I'd be interested in, and I'm sure viewers would be interested in your reactions to the sessions, particularly the session that we just witnessed here with Jimmy. And would you care to comment about the ending there? 

00:24:30
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Well I will comment on the ending. But I also wanna say I was very much at home with James. I have been involved with many children who have expressed continual and intense anger or hostility. On the other hand, I wanted us to end with a sense of closure and with a positive interaction between us. And I wanted him to have the experience of undoing in a dramatic way what he had done in the way of handcuffing me and tying me up. And so I was very impressed with the gentle way in which he removed the handcuffs. I don't know whether you were noticing that but it was a very gentle releasing of each of the handcuffs. I felt no pressure. It was just a kind of caring. I felt a kind of caring unfolding between us there. And then when he removed the rope, the way he did. And the way in which we laughed, it felt to me as though we had come to a turn in that whole process. 

00:25:45
UNKNOWN So that you gave him an opportunity to be nurturing and to leave on that very positive note with you in this relationship. 

00:25:55
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Yes, I think that's, that word I think is very descriptive. He was being nurturing. I felt myself being nurtured. And I had been nurturing him throughout the session. So it was a kind of reciprocity or mutuality or communion that we were sharing at the very end of the session. 

00:26:15
UNKNOWN  I'd be interested in knowing how you felt in the middle of the aggression. He was being quite aggressive toward you. 

00:26:25
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS There were only moments and they were very fleeting when I wasn't sure whether he would actually shoot me in the face. And I did not wanna be shot in the face. But he didn't. He did point the gun in that direction at one point. 

00:26:50
UNKNOWN But he exercised self control. 

00:26:50
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS He exercised self control. And I thought it was important for me not to set the limit but to allow him to establish that limit himself. And I think he did. It wasn't easy being with James and working with James in that he from beginning right to that point expressed continual very strong feelings. But not being easy in that sense is not saying that I don't, didn't value him and value who he was being in those expressions. I just felt a sense of fulfillment when we ended it the way we did. 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN I'd be interested in any other comments you have about this session with Jimmy, your impressions of him as a person, or his needs. 

00:27:55
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS I think that my sense of Jimmy is that he has within him thoughts and feelings that drive him that he's driven by those pulls from within and without. But that someone less experienced, I think, with a boy like Jimmy, would not see those expressions as being on the way to managing himself and controlling himself. I think he veers back and forth, from my observation, that at points I thought he was exercising self control. He certainly was when he had a dart gun right in front of me and coulda shot me in the face. He controlled himself. He didn't shoot me in the face. He accepted the limit which I had set. He even asked me at one point ”Is it okay to shoot you in the leg?” And I then said, “Well, it's okay, let's try you're shooting me in the foot.” And then I said, “Okay, now.” He really did seek confirmation. He didn't just attack me. I think he enjoyed shooting me. I think he perhaps has a great deal of very strong feeling. I did not witness a dualism myself. I did not see Jimmy expressing a dualistic personality. I considered what happened a continuity from a hostile child who seemed very angry and was able to express his anger moving toward a more gentle kind of caring person. 

00:29:55
UNKNOWN I was struck by the gentle way that you avoided stopping the behavior and instead gave him opportunities to continue to express what he wanted to express but in perhaps a little limited way. But that you granted permission for that. 

00:30:15
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Yes. I think that when we discussed this earlier, we talked about limits and I'd indicated that the limits, it's very difficult for me to establish limits in advance. And they would vary with children. And that this was an example of that. I didn't know in terms of alternatives, in terms of limits or boundaries, how far I would be comfortable going with James. And I don't think he knew. I think we discovered in the process that it was okay to shoot me in the chest or even in the throat or in the stomach, in the knees, the legs, the foot. But not okay to shoot me in the face. That was the absolute limit. I wouldn't have set, I wouldn't have known that except in being with him. Now had he moved in other directions I might have settled him earlier, had he taken the sword for instance, and began to approach me in an aggressive or violent way, I probably would have stopped him from doing that. I wouldn't have known what that might be like and I wouldn't have wanted to experience it. 

00:31:40
UNKNOWN Well there were certainly differences in this session with Jimmy and with the younger children. 

00:31:45
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Oh yes. With the younger children I set almost no limits, as you saw. I experienced some challenge, some real tough challenge when I was with the two children together. And as I mentioned to you earlier, it would have been better, I think, had I had an experience with each of the children alone first, which would be my usual way of play therapy. I always met with children individually first so they could be comfortable with me and I comfortable with them before I introduced them to a group therapy process. I don't think it was a serious handicap because I think eventually I felt comfortable and was able to do that. And it was interesting how the two children came together themselves at various points and shared with one another. 

00:32:35
UNKNOWN  It was obvious to me in observing the sessions that your own comfort comes through so readily to the children and helps them to feel comfortable in your presence. 

00:32:50
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Yes. I felt very much at home with myself. 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN We'll stop here. I appreciate so much you're being here and the opportunity to visit with you and just as much the opportunity to watch you work with children. You are a master. 

00:33:05
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS  Well, I do wanna say one more thing, Gary. You've helped me... 

00:33:15
[sil.] 

00:33:25
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS ...to bring a very important life's work to a close. My work with children has in many ways been at the very heart of my life. 

00:33:40
UNKNOWN  It has been your life. 

00:33:45
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS It has been my life. 

00:33:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:33:45
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS And you've, you and even though I resisted it and it took a struggle, I am so happy I allowed myself to break my own limit of not doing any further professional work and doing this one final piece of work with you. 

00:34:05
UNKNOWN I feel very honored that you allowed us to experience your last professional, I'm not sure what to describe, your last professional experience with children and professional presentation and I'm really touched by being a part of, being that part with you and experiencing that last, the last moments of your professional commitment. 

00:34:40
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS I take that to heart. Thank you. 

00:34:40
UNKNOWN Thank you so much.
