SUE JOHNSON Uhm, okay. So I'm going to talk to you today about-- uhm, I know that in this audience there will be mixed, there will be some of you who know emotionally focused couples therapy very well. Uhm, and there will be some of you who don't know my work at all. So, uhm, I'm going to try and sort of go somewhere in the middle. But I was looking at this this morning and I was reading it and I was thinking, hmm, Necessary and Sufficient: The Key Elements of Lasting Change in Couples Therapy. That's actually quite ambitious. Uhm, I wonder, when I did that it must have been late at night or something because, uhm, I was brought up-- I was, uhm, educated Catholic nuns. And, uhm, they gave you an amazing education and they would make you stand up and say things like, "Susan, would you kindly stand up, please, and you have five minutes to discuss, uhm, the necessary and sufficient arguments to proving that a good and perfect God would have created purgatory. Begin." So when I looked at this, I thought I went back to that feeling I have when the nun would point to me and say that, "Ohhh!" But they, they really expect you to do that, by the way. They weren't kidding, okay. They weren't kidding. But actually then I calm down a bit and I think the first thing I wanna say to you is that on some level it really said something about where we are in the field of love relationships and I think where we're going in the field of couple interventions that I can even stand up and presume to put that title on this talk because it's not so very long ago that I wouldn't have been able to tell you what the key elements of change we're in couples therapy even if we could change people in couples therapy let alone lasting change, let alone what was absolutely necessary and sufficient. So I think the fact that I dare to do this on this talk said something about how far we come-- we've come. And what I wanna say to you is that it seems to me that we're in the middle of a revolution in the social sciences in terms of understanding people's love relationships. What you understand, you can shape. And this is-- I think this is huge because after all all through the ages everyone has known that one of the great mysteries of life is love. People don't understand it. They, they fall in love, they fall out of it, it just happens to you. There's nothing you can really do about it. To actually-- for social science to actually be able to say no, we know the laws of love. Love is like everything else. You can understand patterns. You can, uhm, find laws about those patterns, that it's predictable, it makes sense. And if it makes sense then the field of couple intervention is standing on a solid platform but it has never stood on before. So I think that is kind of why I dared to, uhm, put that up there. And the last book here Love Scents, uhm, it's like, I must tell you at the beginning cuz if not I'll not forget and then I'll kick myself. Ah, it's coming out on the first of January. You can pre-order it. And it is, ah, my attempt to follow up to Hold Me Tight which was the book I wrote for the public on all the interventions we have in EFT and how to change a relationship. Love Scents is talking about this new revolution. So what I'm gonna tell you in this talk is that it seems to me that actually in couple therapy at the moment and in our work with emotionally focused couples therapy we are answering the challenge that Arthur Arons who's a social psychologist put out a few years ago when he did a brain scan study and he looked at newly infatuated lovers and long-term lovers, and he put them in a brain scan. He showed them pictures of the person they loved. And he found-- oh! That's weird. Okay. And he-- the lights suddenly changed. And he found that 40% of those long-term lovers their brains reacted in exactly the same way to the pictures of their loved one as the newly infatuated lovers. And what he said, is he said, "This is interesting." It seems that love is not as ephemeral as we thought it was. It's not as transitory as we thought it was. In which case, at least it was a direct challenge. I got it. I don't know if anyone else in my field got it. He said in which case mental health professionals, he didn't actually say get on their bike, but that's what I heard, they need to get on their bike and figure out how to help people do this. Because if it's ephemeral, and this is what people want of the couples therapy, they want a more loving relationship. They don't really just want the fights not to be so bad or a bit more cooperation around chores or problem solving. They want a more caring and loving relationship. And he said if, if love does exist and we can see on the brain scan and it does lost o-- overtime then health professionals need to stop helping people figuring out how to make this happen in their relationship. What I wanna tell him, and I'm gonna talk to you about another brain scan study that we just did and came out on Youtube yesterday, okay, another brain scan study which, uhm, it's as-- answering him and say, "Hey you, Arthur Arons. Hey you, we can show it on a brain scan. We can shift the people in EFT into more secure bonding, not just into a little bit more satisfaction or a little bit less distress or a little bit more problem solving, we can shift people into more secured bonding and we can show you in the brain scan. And we can actually show you what John Bowlby who wrote about attachment theory said all those years ago which is we can show you that when you have emotional engagement with a loving attachment figure who you perceive as loving it changes your world into a safer place. It changes how you perceive threat." So this is why I dare right up here that we're gonna talk about what's necessary and sufficient to create lasting change. What we wanna do in EFT is ambitious. What we wanna do in EFT, in EFT is we want to help create powerful bonding responses in our couples that are so powerful that they will keep doing them, they will keep doing them after therapy and so the results of therapy will last and will last a lifetime. And if that's ambitious, that's okay because we have, ah, two long-term outcome studies that say that at least in the time that we followed them, uhm, we have to be able to do just that. So lasting change. If you think about this, if I'm gonna just talk to you about what's necessary and sufficient, really, what I've got to do is focus on the key elements. So much is happening in a couple session. I think one of the things when I watch my young therapist start to do couples therapy, you know, they walk into supervision with these all days look on their face and they say things like, "I really think actually that in this case the, the, the wo-- the man needs individual therapy and I don't need to do couples therapy with this." And what they really mean is, "My God, this is overwhelming this two people in the room, and they're fighting, and the other conversation changes all the time. And they bring up arguments from 18 years ago. And well, and she say she wants him to tell him-- to tell her he loves her, and then he doesn't and then she kills him. I don't know what to do." So there's so much going on in couples therapy and it shifts very fast, and that's perhaps one of the reasons why we teach our therapists slow it down, slow it down, slow it down. Going slower, you make more progress. Because one of the issues with emotion is it's fast. And so if you want to reprocess it you have to slow it down. So we're talking about key elements. So what do we believe the key elements? If you just want to verge out in the rest of this talk because you've got in late last night from the playing or something, uhm, really what I'm saying to you is you have to change the way people regulate their emotion and send emotional signals to their partner. You have to change the music of the dance so that people can create secure connection with each other. This is the key element. The key elements what Bertalanffy who wrote systems theory said, was he said, what you have to do to change a living system is not deal with all the little tiny elements and modify them. What you have to do is go to the key organizing elements in the system and change those. And when you change those, all the other little elements change because you reorganize the system. The way we go and plug in to the key elements in, in EFT is we go for the attachment emotions because they are the music of the dance. If you reorganize those, you reorganize the dance. If I say, "Just think about it," in terms of fast reorganization, if you're used to dancing a waltz and I put on tango music, you're gonna have a damned hard time keep dancing a waltz. I might have a thing called emotion like that. If we wanna create lasting change, it seems to me we have to give up the idea that we have wonderful magic tricks as therapists. That we have somehow-- that we are clever and amazing and that we can create this magic. I think we have to give up the idea. And what we have to do is understand how love and emotion and relationships work to the point where we can go in and use the most powerful organizing elements that are there, that are already wired in people's brains. So we get really powerful results in EFT not because we are all such clever therapists. Sometimes when we have meetings, we try to tell each other that, "God, you're clever." "No, I'm clever. "You're, you're clever." Because-- actually because we're EFT therapists we don't say, "I'm clever," we say, "You're so clever." There's also this, "You're so clever too." And it sort of becomes, becomes nauseating afterwards. So we don't need to do that. What we need to do is plug in to something more powerful than any therapists. Plug into the survival orientated attachment emotions in people's brains. Plug in to their basic longings for connection. If you turn that on and prime it and show somebody how to walk towards it, they will walk through fire with you. Trauma survivors who have no reason to trust anybody again on this planet, we'll turn and take risk with their partner because you're there with them. People's attachment longings and also people's attachment fears are the most powerful motivators in our mammalian brain. Really what I'm really saying is let's use them, let's plug into this in therapy and use them to-- because we have a map of secure bonding, let's help couples move into this more secure bonding so we can plug into the key elements and then we can make lasting change. Oh! By the way, I didn't say at the beginning because we've got all caught up in whether this was gonna be taped or not, but what I'm gonna here is I'm gonna sort of talk to you and try to give you some ideas and overview of how we see couples therapy in the first hour and a half then we're gonna have a break and then I'm going to give you an exercise that you're gonna play with and show a DVD and talk to you a little bit more. Okay? Okay, that's what we're gonna do here. All right. And you're all suppose to say, yup, okay, okay, that's-- yeah, good, all right, good. All right. So, EFT assumes the key elements of core change second to all the change. Second to all the change is change that reorganizes the system. It doesn't just change a couple of the little elements in this system, but reorganizes the whole system. The key elements are safety in this session to attain emotional balance and so explore. We are attachment theorists in EFT and what John Bowlby said is that when people have a sense of security, a secured base with another person, it's like they can just relax and calm down and then they can look out and explore the universe or go into their internal universe and explore. All right. This is actually just like Carl Rogers said. Carl Rogers said because EFT is a Rogerian therapy, it's an experiential therapy, he said when people are prized and accepted they can explore all their hidden nooks and crannies, the places that they're scared to go. So part of it is creating safety in session to, to help people maintain their balance, regulate their emotion enough that they can tolerate exploring their interactions with their partner, and what's going on inside of them. So in EFT, for example, we asked the therapist to be transparent and genuine and nonjudgmental. Now that can be hard sometimes. To give you a good example, the one I always remember is one of my people-- couple that turns into one of my favorite clients actually. The man-- they come into the session and they sit down in the chair and I say, "Could I help you? What's the problem?" He doesn't even tell me his name. He says to me, "The problem is I don't wanna fat wife." And I look at his wife and she's about size and I immediately have an empathy problem. I mean that, if I was just me, I feel like saying, "Look, buddy." Okay, but that doesn't, doesn't really work, okay. So, so I was thinking about giving this talk, I was thinking, okay, so how do I deal with that. I think what gets me out of that is curiosity. And you know, a good EFT therapist is curious. It's like, that's fascinating. How did this man walk into this room and start there? What is that about? How does that work? What is it about his wife being fat when she's not fat? What is it that his wife being fat that hasn't come in to get so aggressive? And what my EFT brain says to me is on a deeper level there's something really threatening in here. He's threatened, otherwise he wouldn't get so aggressive. All right. And actually, when we went into that couple, I won't tell you, but he was a trauma-- it was a trauma couple and basically the only time he ever safe and ever felt connected at any time in his life was when he was actually making love to his wife. And everyone in his family, all the women in his family had become incredibly obese. And in all his dreadful anxiety he'd write it up that if he's wife ate 2% yogurts, if his wife ate 2% yogurts, then she was gonna get obese and then he wasn't gonna get turned on. Ah, just get a feel for the anxiety. All right. But what the EFT therapist has to do is go in and deal with your own reaction and stay nonjudgmental and say, "What is that? How does that work?" So you have to create safety for both people at the same time in the session. Than can be tricky too. You have to know how to validate one person without validating the other. And we do that a lot by talking about the dogs that they courted. You know, you push, you push, you push because you feel that he's not listening to you and you don't feel connected. And of course, when she pushes I guess you do step back, I do-- guess you do because you're just pushing almost trying to hurt you so you step back, of course, you do. So I'm talking in very simple words. I'm not blaming anybody and she fills in and he fills in. All right. And that's kind of part of the art of couples therapy. So I want you to notice here that immediately I'm going into validating reflecting people. I do not believe that you can create change, any kind of lasting change in couples therapy by telling people what to do or by just giving them cognitive insight. The other thing I want you get, ah, of this talk is that creating key change is all about the level of emotional engagement you create. And you know that. You're gonna hear lots of things in this wonderful few days. And what are you gonna remember on the playing going home. You're not gonna remember the things you were told or the information you were given or even the skill. You're going to remember whether somebody moved you. You're going to remember when you're emotionally engaged. People don't forget that. I can't remember it was at some poet. I can't remember who it was now, who said you forget what people tell you, you forget the things, the, the advice they give you, but you'll never forget how they make you feel. So the other part about this is you have to take people to a new level of engagements in and regulation of their attachment emotions. You have to help them listen to a new music and play a new music with their partner. And the other thing you have to be able to do is create new ways to engage with and signal the partner. You have to be able to create a new dance. What new dance? Well the couple therapy field for a long time really couldn't make up his mind what new dance because if you don't know the theory of love, I don't know, any dance except hostility will do probably because we were obsessed with conflict. It turns out in the new science of love distance actually, emotional distance is actually much more problematic and much more key to the whole issue of marital distress than conflict per se. Lots have very halfway couples fight. The point is they can, they can find a way to turn and bridge that distance. So we need new ways to engage and we need a theory to tell us what new ways are key. What new ways does mammalian brain tune into and accept as absolutely necessary and have a big impact on those. What new ways are they? Well it's not mystery. We were shown those new ways. You could look at a mother and a child interact. And you see the same kind of emotional connection as you do between adult lovers. You know, you watch. Your brain is wired to picked up the cues to another person's face in a 100 milliseconds. And then the mirror neu-- you-- your face imitates their face. The per-- the person whose face you're looking at. And in another 300 milliseconds courtesy of your mirror neurons you have felt in your body what you see on their face. Isn't that amazing? By the way, both talks messes all that up. So in, in 50 years time we're gonna be all totally beautiful and completely unable to communicate with anybody. That's good progress. Okay. So but when if you really wanna see that happening, look in, in attachment bones. Look in it between mother and child and look at it between adult lovers. The incredible flow of emotional messages and synchrony. And you see-- sometimes you see a synchronous flow where both people are moving together and the other times you see disconnection and sometimes you actually see turning away. So what we wanna create in couple therapy is we wanna create the kind of play and safety and synchronous flow that you can see between a mother and child, a securely attached mother and child at play. And it really is-- I want you to really think about it as a dance because you can see it, you can see on interactions between mother and children. You know, the, the little-- the baby looks up-- I'm gonna show you a mother and child a little bit later here. The baby looks up and goes-- opens her eyes wide and goes, "Ha!" and the mother goes, "Hi!" Exaggerates. And the baby goes, ah, and the mother does it as well. And then the baby gets a bit overwhelmed and looks away and the mother pulls and embraces and says, "Yes, yes, isn't it fun?" And uses her voice to soothe. The baby comes back and the mother tunes it again. You can see all that in what we call a whole new tight conversation in the second stage of EFT where the couple has successfully paired their bond. So we have a prototype for the kind of change we're looking at. If we accept that romantic love is all about attachment bonding, if we accept that, we actually have a prototype for what goes wrong in relationships and what lo-- well how good-- what a good relationship looks like if we look at the positive relationships between mothers and children. So what is the problem in EFT? Those of you have heard me, uhm, before you'll recognize this couple, this is my favorite problematic couple from years ago, I want to start off by telling you they did just by in EFT. Okay. But this is my couple. "Do you love me?" Please notice the question and then notice the tone. The tone is aggressive and hostile and the man response to the music, not the content, "Of course, I do." Do you believe him? No. Because he's got flat off it. "How many times have I told you?" "Well it doesn't feel like it." And she tears. And a bit later in the session, she says, "Even when I cry you don't respond to me." "That's right," because you remembers that she's got a gun tucked under her arm. So, well it doesn't feel like it. He said, "Well, maybe you have a problem then. I can't help it if you don't feel loved. Now, I'm gonna tell you that he said the perfect thing to send her mammalian brain into what that concept, the emotion theories calls primal panic. Listen to his message. "I can't help it. It's got nothing to do with me and there's nothing I can do about it if you feel really upset and distressed." That's about the worst message you can give a loved one but you can't imagine. Because we rely on the people we love to help us with our emotions. That's a key part of what love is all about. We rely on the people we love to help us keep our emotional balance. So even if they don't know what to do, if they say, "I see you hurting and I care. I just don't know what to do." That is soothing. This man does the opposite. He basically says, "Nothing I can do. You're upset. It's your problem, nothing I can do." So she e-- escalates and she doesn't feel safe enough to show her panic and vulnerability so she shows her rage. "Right. So it's my problem, is it? Nothing to do with you, right? Nothing to do with your 10-feet thick walls. You're an emotional cripple. You never felt a real emotion in your life." "I refuse to talk to you when you get like this. So irrational. There is no point. If I had a dollar to every withdrawer that told me there is no point, there's nothing I can do, I'm helpless here so I do nothing, I'd live in a much bigger house." "Right. This is what always happens. You put up your wall and you go icy till I get tired and get up. And then after a while when you want sex you decide that I'm not quite so bad after all." "There's no point in talking to you. This is a shooting gallery. You're so aggressive." 

00:25:35
The Problem: W: Do you love me? (accusing tone) H: Of course I do. How many times have I told you? W: Well it doesn't feel like it (tears, looks down, turns away) H: (Sighs-exasperated) Well, maybe you have a problem then. I can't help it if you don't feel loved. (Set mouth, lecturing tone.) W: Right. So it's my problem is it? Nothing to do with you, right? Nothing to do with your ten feet thick walls. You're an emotional cripple. You've never felt a real emotion in your life. H: I refuse to talk to you when you get like this. So irrational. There is no point. W: Right. This is what always happens. You put up your wall. You go icy. Till I get tired and get up. Then, after a while, when you want sex you decide that I am not quite so bad after all. H: There is no point in talking to you. This is a shooting gallery. Rigid pattern- blame/withdraw and absorbing states of negative emotion form feedback loop. No safe emotional connection-escalating danger and isolation. 

00:25:35
SUE JOHNSON What you have here is what my colleague John Gottman talks about as a nice clear criticized complaint express contempt defend distance stonewall. Let's just say you have a nice demand withdrawal cycle. That's what you've got here. So, and we see this leads to divorce. Why is this so destructive? Well, you could say because it puts everybody in a whole bunch of pain. But you can also say it's so destructive because it creates-- it just demolishes the safety in the relationship. And it absolutely precludes anybody being able to do what you have to be able to do to create a secured bond which is to turn, keep your emotional balance, and reach for the other person in a way that invites them close. This couple can't do that. So they're just gonna get more and more-- they're gonna see each other as the enemy. You see here the classic thing in distress. You see distorted images, two extreme versions of emotional regulation, neither of which are very useful. You see how ramping up into anxious attachment and, and screaming loud that would get him to her here and you see him shutting down and turning away and stonewalling. By the way, it's key part of marital distress that neither one of this couple understand the impact they're having on the other. Couples really do not understand the impact they have on each other. And I think that's one of the key things that a science of love and the couples therapist can help them understand. They really do not understand. It is not the same to turn to one of your friends or one of your acquaintances and say, "I really can't have this conversation right now. Uhm, I'm, I'm sorry, but I need to go." To turn to your partner in the middle of something like this and say, "I really can't have this conversation right now, I'm leaving," that's a whole different bag. The one is unpleasant and hurtful. The second one is a danger cue for your mammalian brain and it puts you into survival mode and it creates, ah, attachment panic. So couples don't get that, all right. And it's important for the, the therapist to get that. I want to point out that there's lots of ways of seeing this piece of dialogue, a thousand ways. Some of the-- what I used to do when I taught undergrad was I tell my undergrads, "Tell me the things that are going on here. What's the key thing that's going on." So all they know is how to struggle. "Oh, I don't know, she's had bad relationships all her life and it's projective identification. She's projecting onto him from her childhood." "Oh, I don't know, he's just male and everyone knows that men and women are on different planets and he can't talk about his feelings." Really? I've seen a lot of men talked about their feelings just fine not any need of a little bit of help. So you can look at this. What we see is separation distress. What we see is the same thing that happens when a mother refuses to look-- I was-- I sit in airports and I watch people. When the mother, when the baby keeps trying to get the mother's attention and the mother is too into her iPad and she doesn't look at the baby and she actually turns away and then she walks away to talk to somebody about getting more points on her card for her plane, and the baby suddenly realizes that she is not gonna respond to him and he starts to scream his head off. This is the same thing that's happening here. If you see this, if you want to stand the drama that's going on, then you understand that you can plug into it, you start to understand and you start to know how to shift it and shape it. But if you get caught in the content here, you say, "I'm gonna teach this people negotiation skills, I would suggest to you, you can do that until you're a purple. Okay. It's not really gonna make, ah, much of our issue because you're on the wrong level. You have to go in and work where this is really happening which is at the emotional level. So, I wanna back off a little bit. And the other thing I wanna say here is this issue of emotional connection, I think one of the reasons why we're becoming so aware of it is just in our society in general and I'm gonna talk more about this in the talk I'm giving on Saturday. Uhm, this issue of emotional connection, there's a reason why this is so present and powerful right now in our society. Somebody send this to me and said, "I think this is a picture of modern marriage." Only it's wrong because he would be on a, on a-- uhm, he would be looking on screen not on newspaper. Okay. Please notice the distance. We need more from our lovers and our close partners than we have ever done before. We do not live in villages. My grandmother live to the small English village with an enormous web of support underneath here, with people she grown up with all her life. Most of us, like, we're very lucky living a community of two, maybe two or three. We live long way from our, our, ah, families that we grow up with. We hardly have time for any kind of social interaction anymore. We rely on our partner for this emotional connection. So our love relationships are often our only source of real deep connection and support and caring and the only place where we can create our emotional balance. The last surveys in the U.S. said that a quarter of people in the U.S. said they had no one to confide in at all. If you understand anything about attachment, this is disastrous. If you believe that the most basic instinct in man is not sex and aggression, the most basic instinct to man is to connect with another human being and matters of the other human being so that if you call that human being it will come to you, if you believe that, this is really disastrous. And I think this also talks about the fact that we talk in EFT about the key issue in marital distress is not fights and disagreements. Securely attached couples can deal, can deal with all kinds of disagreements and differences. I use my own relationship as example. My husband is a crazy west coast mountain who if you show him at large hill that goes like that, he says, "Oh, goodie, let's go up it." Which I think he's really strange because I say, "That looks really steep. Why don't we just go round?" All right. And he thinks I'm completely crazy because I am obsessed with Argentinian tango. All right. So it's sort of it's-- Argentinian tango, by the way, has all kinds of, uhm, the same sort of-- if you do, we have here to understand the magic of Argentinian tango. When I went to my first-- this is totally aside, ah, but I'll tell you anyway. When I went to first my-- my first tango lesson, my tango teacher was not a Rogerian therapist. He is, he is, he is not filled with empathy, and he said, "I can't imagine why you want to learn Argentinian tango, it's very difficult, very complicated. Uhm, you, you have no balance at all and your coordination is appalling. And, uhm, I really don't know why you want to learn it. And anyway, what I wanna tell you is Argentinian tango is an improvised dance. It's not really the steps. There's no set steps. You have to tune into a partner, be completely present and totally tuned into that partner and present in the present moment and move in synchrony. But you probably have no idea what I'm talking about." So I said, "Just shut up and teach me the dance, okay?" So we're very different. But it's okay because our differences do not threaten us or threaten our bond. In fact, we can bring what we take from those through activities and live in our bond. So you know, this isn't about when you have differences or not. But this picture speaks to me about what really happens in relationships which is that people get stuck in this kind of distance and this hurts. 

00:34:10
Shut Down Shut In Shut Out Protection / Prison 

00:34:10
SUE JOHNSON So I'm gonna skip of that joke and I'm just gonna give you think this one because somebody sent to me in particular. We have not understood the power of shut down in intimate relationships. We have not understood that one of the laws of love is that you need to have this connect-- emotional connection. And when you cannot find it, it is deeply alarming to you. And when your partner shuts down and shuts you out, that is gonna create the most enormous physiological response. So shut down, people say I shut down to protect myself. I shut down to not be vulnerable because nothing else is gonna work. I shut down to protect the relationship, to stop having the fight. The issue is when you shut down you are shut in, you are alone, and your partner out. And one of the basic things in couples is that what they do to protect themselves which they have very good reasons for and always make sense to them and have been usually over learned in other relationships or in this relationship, what they do to protect themselves becomes not a-- becomes a prison for them and becomes a source of incredible pain for their partner. Okay. And what attachment theory does is give you a frame to understand that and help partners understand it.

Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy Looks within at how partners construct their emotional experience of relatedness. • (Using Rogerian Interventions) Looks between at how partners engage each other • (using Systemic Interventions and tasks) In Order To: • Reprocess / expand emotional responses • Create new kinds of interactions / change the dance • Foster secure bonding between partners WEBSITE: www.iceeft.com 

00:35:40
SUE JOHNSON So EFT looks within at how partners construct their emotional experience of relatedness in a Rogerian way and looks between at how partners engage each other. In terms of, uhm, experiential therapy, your good mark in his book in mindfulness talks about the fact that it's rather strange thing that we're talking about mindfulness when experiential therapist have been doing mindfulness for years. Unique experiential therapy, what do you do? You help someone feel safe and you support them enough and you go in and you help them stay with their present experience and then open to the flow of their present experience and stay with it in a nonjudgmental way. And when you do that, and you're with them, and you support them, they start to understand how they construct that experience. That is mindfulness and that is experiential therapy. That's exactly the same thing. All right. But what we do is we use a Rogerian frame to talk about how to make people feel safe and help people into that. And it looks between at how partners engage each other and I always use, uhm, some Minuchin as an example of that. We create enactments. All right, we create enactments. Could you turn to your partner and say this, "Years ago, uhm, so I think you used to didn't understand EFT and didn't think it was pretty good. But these days, he seems to think it's okay. That's good." But-- so, maybe it's because I tell-- I say overtime that really we used him as a model for how to create enactments. What are we doing? We are reprocessing, expanding emotional responses. We are going passed the surface level into the deeper level. What you usually see in a couple is somebody we flat affect, closing themselves down, shutting their partner out, and somebody with-- who can't control their emotion, who's really, really, really, really, really upset. All right. So somebody who doesn't have any affect regulation and somebody who's suppressing-- by the way, all the research says the suppression of emotion is incredibly hard work physiologically. And that's good for you to know as a therapist. What I tell my beginning therapist is, "You don't have to do any magic to get somebody who's suppressing their emotion into it. All you have to do is keep coming back and prime it five times. They can't keep it up." It literally takes too much glucose to your brain for you to keep pushing the emotion down. So if you keep coming back and evoke in the emotion, that ability to suppress it is just gonna dissolve on you. So we go passed the surface flat affect and this regulated affect into what? Into all the basic longings and fears that we have as human beings, into the basic vulnerability in love which is the fear we all have that we are gonna be rejected and abandoned. So you expand emotional responses down into the deeper primary level in order to create new kinds of interactions. You cannot create positive loving responses, you cannot create things like tenderness desire, the need-- the desire to be close, the longing to be close by telling people what to do or by giving them insights and explanations. You can only help create it in the session by getting the partner to send very particular cues that evoke it. And by you evoking it in the way you are and your level of emotional engagement. So we use emotion, we shift emotion, we evoke emotion to create new kinds of interactions, new kinds of responses. And what new responses? Responses that foster secure bonding because we believe that is the way to create key lasting change in couples.

THE 5 Basic Moves of EFT Repeat these 5 moves again and again, as you move through the steps and stages of EFT. Dancing the EFT Tango 1. Reflect Present Process (within/between) 2. Explore more primary, deeper or more emotions. 3. Set with coherent enactment (pass more primary emotion to the partner) 4. Process the Enactment/How it feels to tell/hear 5. Integrate/Validate/Reflect Process (View of Self, View of Others, Relationship) "Tie a bow" 

00:39:40
SUE JOHNSON The five basic moves-- and I couldn't resist making a tango, please forgive me. The five basic moves of EFT are you watch an EFT therapist. EFT changes across therapy. We do anything from eight to 20 sessions. And of course, it will change across therapy. Actually, the EFT therapist becomes more directive as therapy progresses and then sort of backs off and takes the hands off at the end. But nevertheless, if, if you watch all across therapy, you will see the EFT therapist doing the same thing, perhaps with different levels of intensity. What you will see, all right, you will see the therapist reflecting present process, what is within and between. What just happened here? Could you help me? What just-- I'm thinking of the couple I saw last week. Could you help me what just happened here? You are always talking about how you need this emotional connection with your partner and your partner turn to you. And his face softened and his eyes with filled with tears and he reached for it and he said, "I have let you down. I didn't know how to be close. But I don't know how to tell you how much I love you. I'm so scared of losing you. I want to be a good husband. I want you to let me in." And you sat back in your chair and you sort of-- your face went tight and you turned away and you looked out the window and then you said to him, "Yes, but you said you would fix the cabinets by Wednesday night and you didn't fix them. You've only finished fixing them on Friday morning. Isn't that what happened?" And one of the things about coming in EFT therapist is you have to develop the most amazing memory for moments of dialogue and it's very useful in your own marital arguments. It's actually quite useful when you argue with deans at universities as well. I say, "Excuse me, but I'm a couples therapist and I code interactions all the time. And what you said exactly was this."

00:41:55
SUE JOHNSON So you reflect and you think within and between, what happened there and then. And as you turn away, "Could you help me? What happened inside?" And she says, "I hear him. I hear him." You say, "Could you help me? What happened when you hear him? Is it ok-- is it okay if I guess? Is this one of these moments when part of you hears him but another part of you, you go to what you call the jury in your head, do you?" And part of you says, don't, don't, don't risk it, don't, he's not gonna-- and she laughs and she just says, "Yes, that's right." I said, "Oh, geez, I wish we could get that jury to go for coffee or something. All right. And we play with it, we play with it. But I go in, I go between, and I go in. All right. We reflect the present process. So basically, your husband reaches for you right now which would be longing for all this time but it's almost like you don't trust it so you step back and you get cautious, is that right? And in your head you say, "Don't trust it, you'll only get hurt again." She says, "Yes, that's right." So I've reflected the process.

Integrate/Validate/Reflect Process (View of Self, View of Others, Relationship) "Tie a bow" 

00:43:05
SUE JOHNSON Then I'm gonna go in somewhere. Now I could go in with him. He's reaching, he's weeping, that must be very difficult for him. He doesn't get a response. Uhm, or I could go in with her. So in this case actually I-- and, and with him. And I said, "Now, could you help me? What's happening for you right now? You came in and you told me, I don't know anything about emotions, I don't think I've ever felt emotions, my family didn't feel emotions. And here you are, you're sitting here in the chair, you're reaching for your partner, you've got tears in your eyes, this is amazing that you can take this kind of risk. You have so much, ah, strength to do this. Could you tell me what's happening for you right now?" And, and he, he cries again because he's not used to being validated. And he says, "It's scary and it's difficult but you know in this process what I've really learned is I love my wife so much. I love her so much it's worth it. Any risk I take is worth it." All right. So here he goes into deeper emotion. He goes into his longing. All right. So you'd go to the deeper emotion and you, you set up an enactment. What you've done is just reached in and deepened his experience just a tiny little bit. And then from that new experience you ask him to give a new signal to his partner. You change the new experience into a new piece of music. A new signal which is an invitation to a new kind of dance. Cuz actually out of this session this man still pretty shocked out. So I say to him, "Could you turn and tell her please? Could you turn and tell her?" "I don't know how to do this dance and I have been shut down. But I love you so much. I love you so much so you're worth reaching for, you're worth risking for. And it's hard to do this but I'm gonna do it." "Can you tell her, I love you so much, I'm gonna re-- I'm gonna keep reaching?" So he takes his new experience and he turns it into a new signal to her. All right, and that's a key piece of EFT. You change new experience into new signal.

00:45:15
SUE JOHNSON Then what do you do, you process it. How did it feel to do that now? Well, uhm, it's weird and I'm not used to doing this but actually, uhm, it sort of felt good. When you order people's experience and help them make sense of it and validate it even if it has some pain in it, they feel competent. They feel able to deal with their experience. He said, "It feels good, it feels good to do that because, because I do love her and I don't wanna lose her. And, and, and I haven't known how to do this, and I love her." And I said to her, "And how does it feel to hear him say it?" And she la-- she, she laughs at me. She says, "I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I like it the minute-- when he first says it, I like it and it touches me," and she tears for a moment. Just-- "And then, and then it's like I can't take it in, I can't take it in," and she does this with her hand. So you stay with her ambiguity then. Part of you likes it, part of you lets it in, and part of you it's difficult. She needs some time here, all right. You don't insist that she respond. You go with what she can give. She needs some time. So I say, "Right. So part of you can let it in but another part of you is unsure." All right. 

00:46:30
THE 5 Basic Moves of EFT Repeat these 5 moves again and again, as you move through the steps and stages of EFT. Dancing the EFT Tango 1. Reflect Present Process (within/between) 2.

Integrate/Validate/Reflect Process (View of Self, View of Others, Relationship) "Tie a bow" 

00:46:30
SUE JOHNSON And then you-- what do you do? You validate and integrate. You say, "But you guys, look at what you just did. You put a bow on it. You create competence in this emotional field where people feel so helpless. Now, look at what you just did there. That's amazing that you could come in to therapy." You know, ah, he was-- he told me-- in first session, he said, "If I'm gonna work with you, I'm gonna get you thesis at the library and I'm gonna read it." And I said, "Jolly good, there's 10 bucks in it. Just because I wondered if anyone would ever read it. So if you find the 10 bucks, nobody has ever read it except you." Okay. So, you know, this is him. So I said, "Look at what you've just done now. This is amazing. I change his sense of self. You can really do this. You know how to do this now. Even if your parents didn't show, you know how to do this. You know, you can prompt in to your emotions and you can reach for your partner, that's amazing to your sense of self, his sense of eager." And you know how she's worth, she's worth reaching for. You plug into her, you do it with her, and you say, "And you're so honest here, that's amazing that you can stay and listen to him and it's too hard to let him right now but you're struggling with it, you're struggling and you can talk about your struggle. Hey guys, that's really, really good. Bow." Tiny little piece of process. Tiny shift in the music. Chiny-- tiny shift in the step towards each other. Look at what you just did guys. Bow on it. You can do it. One of the reasons why we take people into difficult emotions in EFT and our dropout rate is so astoundingly low in our clinical practice and in our research studies is because I think we help people all through their experience and understand it and we give them the sense of competence. So the EFT therapist does this all the time. And these bills over the number of sessions into powerful new corrective emotional experiences that change how people experience themselves and their partner and how competent they feel in creating their bond. How am I doing? I always come into these talks with about 18 weeks of stuff to talk to you about. 

00:48:55
EFT Research Meets the gold standard set out by bodies such as APA for psychotherapy research. EFT epitomizes the very highest level set out by this standard. The meta-analysis (Johnson et al, 1999) of the four most rigorous outcome studies conducted before the year 2000, showed a larger effect size (1.3) than any other couple intervention has achieved to date - 70-75% recovered on DAS with significant improvement - 86-90% Studies consistently show excellent follow-up results - some studies show that significant progress continues after therapy. Nine studies on the process of change validate EFT interventions. The generalizability of EFT across different kinds of clients and couples e.g. depression and PTSD - results are consistently positive. A recent study on EFT effects on attachment security with an FMRI component shows that EFT changes attachment security and the way contact with a partner mediates the effect of threat on the brain. 

00:49:00
SUE JOHNSON So, uhm, forgive me if I go over-- uhm, uhm, no, ah, I'm not gonna talk about that. I'm just gonna tell you what was on it, okay? Basically, because we understand the power of emotion and we understand the power of attachment and we can plug into that, and because we had done about 16 outcome studies now, and we have about nine studies of process which is looking at understanding the process of change, okay, what I'm gonna suggest to you is that EFT, ah, really meets the goal standard for research that's to be set out by people like the American Psychological Association. And, uhm, meta-analysis show that we get the best results in the field, we get 70 to 73% of couples coming out of the stress at the end of therapy and 86 to 90% of couples having gone through significant improvement even if they're not exactly where they wanna be and totally non-distressed at the end of therapy. Uhm, and by the way now research studies sometimes the end of therapy isn't ideal so you use the resources. You have to do a research study and sometimes now in our research studies we're trying to give people 20 sessions. We have more money in the early days when a lot of this research started. We would only give people 12 sessions and some couples would say to us, "Listen, that just wasn't enough." We also show excellent followup results and EFT generalizes the different kinds of couples. For example, we work with des-- with the depressed couples, we work with lots of PTSD couples. There's a few who know my work, know that I have a particular, ah, passion for working with traumatized couples becau-- perhaps because my parents were traumatized couple. My father was a naval commando and I think definitely their marriage, uhm, reflected what happened to him in the war. So-- and what I wanna show is just a tiny little-- I can't resist even though I'm gonna talk about it on Saturday, a tiny little piece of what we found in our brain scan study. 

00:51:00
Changing Responsiveness to Threat with EFT Pre-Therapy Partner Handholding Post-Therapy Partner Handholding 

00:51:05
SUE JOHNSON This is two pictures of the woman's brain. On this side is pre-therapy with her partner holding her hand. And on the left side, the blue, is post-therapy. So while-- I'll give you a bit of context for this. Basically, we took these couples into therapy. We had a brain scan component and we said we will take the woman in the brain scan. The reason we chose the woman was because we didn't have enough money to do both. So we put the woman in the brain scan before therapy and you've let-- if you've anal-- ever lain in the brain scan, ah, it's not very nice, your head is in a cage, you can't move your head on the things going and making noises all around you. We left her alone in the machine and we showed her an X in front of face occasionally and we said, "When you see the X, there's about a 20 to 30% chance you'll be shocked on your ankles." When the woman lies alone in the machine, her brain lights up like the fourth of July sky. And if you ask her if the shock hurts, she said, "Yes, it really hurts." If you get a stranger to hold her hand, same thing happens. If you get her husband to hold her hand, same thing happens. The husband is not a safety cue. It makes no difference that he's there, no difference. That's before therapy. After EFT, 20 sessions of EFT where they've had this powerful bonding conversations, what we call hold me tight conversations. The woman is alone in the machine, she sees the X, her brain lights up like the fourth of July sky, the shock hurts. A stranger holds her hand, it's a little bit better. This time, it's a little bit better. Okay? Her brain-- but her brain still really lights up, the shot really hurts. When her husband holds her hand when she sees X after these bonding conversations in therapy, what you're seeing is blue. That's the equivalent basically nothing happens. I asked Jim Coan at the University of Virginia, the neuroscientist who I did this with, "What does the blue mean, Jimmy?" He says basically it means that she's not dead. I said, "Well, okay, that's good." This is fascinating and what I wanna tell you is something that really fascinates me. It's not just that her amygdala soothed. I sort of expected that. It's not just that her amygdala which is the prime place in your brain that orient-- that orientates to and process this threat was served. How prefrontal cortex doesn't turn on? What that suggest is the contact with the husband who is now experienced as a source of safety and soothing, the contact with the husband doesn't just help her control the fear, doesn't just help her deal with the fear better because the prefrontal cortex would be as active as hell. It changes the perception of threat at source. That is the most powerful form of affect regulation possible. It changes the perception of threat at source and that's very interesting because John Bowlby who wrote about sis-- about attachment theory said, "When you have a secure connection with another human being who has your back, who will come when you call, the world is a safer place literally. You frame the world as safer. Threat is encoded differently because you are not facing it alone." And so that's very interesting. So it supports EFT. It supports how our mammalian brain uses another person, a loved one to deal with fear. It supports attachment theory. So, uhm, I just have to show that with you. And I'm afraid if you hear me on Saturday you're gonna hear it again. So tough. Okay. But I think it's pretty special stuff.

The Focus of EFT (The 4 P's) EXPERIENTIAL • PRESENT MOMENT (Emotion brings past alive. Past used to validate present blocks, styles, fears). • PRIMARY AFFECT - Focus on / Validate SYSTEMIC • PROCESS (across time) - PIVITOL MOMENTS • POSITIONS / PATTERNS of interaction - self sustaining feedback loops THE THERAPIST IS A PROCESS CONSULTANT 

00:55:00
SUE JOHNSON EFT is experiential. We stay in the present moment. If you're going to shift things, you have to shift it in the now. You have to create something powerful enough in the now that the past almost becomes irrelevant. Emotion brings the past of life. So if people are talking about the fight they had three weeks ago, you say, "And how are you feeling as you talk about this? How do you feel about it now?" And you start picking up on the key things they've talked about. We talk about is emotional handles. You use the phrase, you say, "Could you help me?" You use the word shattered. That's a very-- you go for the images. Use the word shattered. That's an amazing image. You-- and can you feel about it right now? She says, "Yes, yes, I'm talking about it now and I can feel it. I just feel like I'm gonna fall apart here. I don't mean anything to this man. I don't mean anything to him." And she's in it, she's in it now. You have to be in emotion to shift it. Vulpine you that the person that came out would expose you on that. You have to be in emotion to fix it. You can explain emotion and talk about it until you are purple. I don't know why I was thinking purple here, so it's blue, whatever. Right. It's not gonna make any difference. People have to feel it to change it. And of course we use the past to validate. We say, "Of course, you shut down. Of course, you shut down now." In your family that was the very best thing to do. That saved your life. That had you feeling like you belonged, your whole family will during that. Of course you do. That's okay. That was a very good thing to do. And now it gets you started with your partner. So often in mental health it's like the things we did to get us through the night, and we all have things we'd done and do to-- have, have got us through the bad places in our life. The things we did to get us through the night, we get stuck in them. And then they get in the way of us moving freely into new situations and seeing what is there. I mean, you could say that's the whole problem in mental health, period. Health is really not about never doing anything that's a bit, uhm, dysfunctional or a bit rigid to get you through the night. It's about being able to shift that and revise those strategies and ways of dealing with your emotion and connecting with other people in new situations. All right. And that's what we're gonna try-- that's what we're trying to do in EFT. 

00:57:35

00:57:35
SUE JOHNSON We go for primary emotion, the deeper emotion, not the surface. We focus on pivotal moments. What are the pivotal moments? Moments of connection and disconnection. Attachment theory tells you what the pivotal moments are that define a relationship. All right. You all know that-- I invite you to think about-- I was starting to think about-- I was thinking about my own relationship. My poor husband, he gets to talk about all the time up here. And I can remember when we first got together, you know, we're, we're both pretty strong people so we argue overtime. But there's a certain tone in his voice that would tell me that we were on dangerous ground and it goes something like, it would go, na-na-na-na-na-na-na, and then there'd be a pause and he'd go, "What did you say?" And my brain would go, "Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Wait a minute. Oh, ah, let's just be-- oh, oh, I-- okay, uh-huh. I don't know. What did I, what did I say? Ah! I didn't mean it that. I didn't mean that." I was like-- I was exaggerating. I exaggerated all the time. This is probably personal. So there are pivotal moments, all right, and it is all about your brain, you are a mammal. Your brain picks up certain signals as survival cues. They're all about whether you belong or whether you're on your own. And you know those because they zing in you. They zing in you. And by the way, you can use that when you work with your clients. How do you know that they are on to some key moment and to stay with it because you're tuned in, you're emotionally present? We talk about alliance and lots of ways especially it can't resist like this. But for me the issue with alliance is to be emotionally engaged with your clients so that you can tune in to their emotion so that when they feel that zing, you get it too. You're tuned in, you feel it, you know that what they're talking about is incredibly important. You know to stay there because you feel it. Not because you read the manual and you're figuring all that in your head, but because you feel it too. All right. So we go into the pivotal moments. We look at patterns of interaction.

01:00:00
SUE JOHNSON The pro-- the therapist is a process consultant. The therapist is focusing down on what matters and keeping out all the noise. And you'll see me doing that in a tape in a little while because the reason I've chosen this tape to show you, it's from training tape five, is that this is a California couple. And the thing about it is that the man knows how to talk about emotion very well. But actually, feeling it is a whole different issue. And what he does is constantly exit. And what you're gonna watch me doing is constantly keeping my focus and bringing him back, bringing him back to the key primary emotion that is the music that's guiding his feet in this dance that he does with his partner.

01:00:50
SUE JOHNSON Okay. And after the coffee, we're gonna do a little exercise on emotion. It is important then for us to get away from this crazy idea that we've had in this society since day care that emotion is somehow illogical or you know, sort of it's just kind of like mood, it's transient, and you can kind of put it to one side. Emotion is a high level survival orientated information processing system. And it's very fast. And that is designed to save your life and it can also be a bit problematic because we-- it's almost like we skip to the end of the thing and we have to kind of backed up to understand how we got there. But if you understand the key elements of emotion and the key emotions, then you can walk around in this and you can use it as a therapist. Every emotion has a cue, a rapid perception which is like good-bad, pleasure-pain, safe-dangerous. It's just like that. So somebody will say, "I don't know why. I don't know why but what's happening right feels bad." Right? And then you can back up and say, "Could you help me? When did you start feeling bad?" Is that voice-- she, she uses-- she-- her voice goes on, "Did, did you hear how her voice? That's bad. All right, I know something bad is gonna happen." Body arousal. His body got aroused before he can even make sense of what's going on. Cue plus rapid perception, body arousal. The perception is al-- almost like an orientation. Emotion tells you what matters. You're listening to me and thinking about the coffee you're gonna have in a few minutes, but if the alarm went off in this building you shift your focus. Your brain would say, "That matters." That's what emotion does. It tells you what matters and it orientates you to your needs particularly your survival needs. One of the big fights years ago I used to have with Neil Jacobson, the father of cognitive behavioral marital therapy is I used to say, "I didn't know why you make all this fuss about talking to people of other notions, just get them in the room, ask them what they need, and then negotiate, have them negotiated." And so, well, the problem is they didn't know what they need. If people aren't into their emotions and really going into their emotions, they don't know what they need. And I'm really sure about. Damasio, the emotion theorist, talks about the fact that really if you don't-- if you're not tuned in to your body, you have no preferences. So people who are injured in the amygdala part of their brain and their emotions have trouble making the smallest decisions. Chocolate or vanilla, choose. Well, if you have no emotional resonance for either, you go, "Well, I don't know. Uhm, I like white and vanilla's white. And, ah, but chocolate is good. Ah, you know, sometimes I'd like chocolate." And they can't make the simplest decisions. Emotion orientates you and tells you what you need, tells you what the link between environment cues and what you need.

01:04:00
SUE JOHNSON So it's a source of information, vital element in meaning, and it primes in action response. So what we've got is body arousal, meaning, you were signing a meaning in the emotion, have face that look on her, that sound in her voice and look on her face is dangerous. It means she's gonna attack me and you have an action tendency. Emotion comes from the Latin word ēmovēre to move. It moves people in the dance. The key reason we work with emotion is the last point here. It communicates. It organizes social interaction. So it makes no sense for me then if you're gonna create lasting change not to work actively with emotion. If you don't work it with it you try to go round it and use other interventions, it can derail you in a moment and we've all experienced that, where we've worked to get a couple to be open intended to each other and then somebody says the wrong thing and two minutes later they're in a fight in your office like you saw 14 weeks ago before you did all this work. You know, and that's one of the times when you think, "Why did I become a couples therapist?" If I'd got into dentistry I could have Fridays off, you know, to stuff it."

01:05:20
SUE JOHNSON Okay. So emotion communicates and there are six core emotions. If you believe the book with the Dalai Lama that one page three it says there are 1863, uhm, negative emotions, then I would not suggest to try to do EFTs cuz it will take you about 82 years. So, ah, but if you know, and this is the work of people like Paul Ekman that there are six basic core emotions, facial expressions, that everyone in this planet can read, there are link to adaptive actions, and that we can all assign the same meaning to. We all know what this means on somebody's face. Anger, which is about asserting and defending yourself in couple therapy. And I think the, the definition that John Bowlby made when he said there are two kinds of anger. There's the anger of hope and the anger of despair. In your couples, you're gonna see reactive anger despair. The anger of hope sounds like, "You know what you're late. You're late. I can't believe that. We talked about it yesterday. I said to you, I said don't be late. I can't bear being late from the theater. And it's like you don't care about me. You just don't care about what matters to me and you're late again." Now that's the anger of hope. It's-- you could just hear in my voice that I'm angry and upset and I'm asserting myself but there's a sort of openness there. So when my partner says, "I know, I know, I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. I'm gonna start to soften and listen." That's not what you hear in your couple sessions. Most of you here, couples, start into the reactive anger of despair, "You're late. You're late because you're always late because you don't give a damn about anyone else but yourself. That's the truth." That's the anger of despair. So you see, a lot of reactive anger. Sadness, surprise and excitement. Sadness is about withdrawing. Surprise is about exploring and attending. Shame, fear and joy. So usually I tell people we don't have to worry so much about surprise and joy because couples don't come into my office and say we have entirely too much joy and surprise in this relationship. But how free we do get a little bit of surprise and joy happening in the sessions. Right. But they do come in shame. Well, uhm, actually you'll see I'm using, uhm, this lady in the clinical demonstration. Uhm, she says well maybe it's that I'm just too difficult to love. It could be that I'm, I'm-- ah, maybe I am. Maybe I'm, I'm, I'm too difficult to love. Maybe, and that's shame. There's something wrong with me. I'm flawed. We draw our say all the time. We draw that there's male or female say, "I don't know what to do here, I don't know what to do and, and I'm, I'm the big disappointment. That's what I am. I'm the big disappointment and, uhm, I don't know how to respond here and I can't please this person and, you know, uhm, I failed. I, I, I basically have failed and I think there's something wrong with me. I, I, I should be able to please my wife. And, uhm, not felt that shame." And if you wanna ask me what the most difficult emotion to do is is it's always shame. The most difficult emotion is shame because the action tends to be behind shame is to hide and shut down and withdraw and then you'll not open to new experiences which can change, a new feedback that can change that shame. Shame, and by the way, what I would tell my couples is he's a good example of the difference between the powerful therapist and the power of the attachment figure. In a way, EFT is powerful because the couple, the partners change each other, not because the therapist changes them, the new attachment signals change. If you have somebody who's lost in the dark pit of shame, PTSD survivor for example, you as a therapist with all your interventions have a small little 20-watt lightbulb to shine down into that pit of shame. The partner has a stadium floodlight. Get the partner to turn the stadium floodlight on four or five times, that shame will shift. And you see that particularly with war vets, particularly when, when, when we work with the firemen in New York after 9/11. Your firemen-- ah, in the, in the New York Fire Department the men would say all the good firemen died that day. Ah, survivor guilt. All the good firemen died that day? Come on. Who's the most-- what's the most powerful place to heal that? In the arms of their wife. In the arms of their wife. But they have to be able to talk about it and have the out-- and to open for their wife to comfort them to feel that.

01:10:20
SUE JOHNSON Most of the time in EFT and in-- ah, ah, that kind of therapy you're dealing with fear. You're dealing with some version of Panksepp's attachment panic. It says there's a special pathway in your brain that is reserved in a mammalian brain for panic about, ah, attachment figure being inexcessive and unresponsive. All right. And he talks about that. He says that is, that is the key thing that's going on. Most of the time you're dealing with the pain of rejection and abandonment. And I'm going to speed things up. 

01:10:50
Faces expressing the emotions of anger (A), surprise (B), disgust (C), sadness (D), happiness (E) and fear (F) from the collection by Ekman and Friesen 

01:10:50
SUE JOHNSON But I'm just gonna show you these expressions. This is from Ekman. Anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness, and fear. The happiness one always bothers me a bit. But anyway, whatever. Okay. 

01:11:10
Science 2013 - Study by Eisenberger (U of California) • The shock and distress of rejection and exclusion register in the same part of the brain as physical pain - the anterior cingulate. • "This part of the brain is active any time we are separated from our close companions." • BROKEN HEART is a reality. "This is a defensive mechanism - to make sure we stay close - don't stray too far - if we do - we are not going to survive. It hurts to be separated from other people. 

01:11:10
SUE JOHNSON One thing I wanna stress because I've only got about five minutes to talk about attachment after this. One thing I wanna stress is as we learn about love and how powerful this need to get people to respond to us is for us as human beings. What I want you to get is that, that when people talk about pain in couples therapy it's not a metaphor. And this helps me with my empathy. The shock and distress of rejection and exclusion register in the same part of the brain and, ah, processed in the same way as physical pain. They're both registered in the anterior cingulate. This part of the brain is active anytime we are separated from close companions. What Eisenberger who did this research talks about is broken heart in a sense is a reality. All right. This is our brain's defensive mechanism to make sure we stay close, we don't stray too far, ah, but it, it, it hurts and it's not safe to be really separated from other people. Emotional isolation is traumatizing in human beings. That doesn't mean you can't live alone. If you listen to someone like the Dalai Lama, it always strikes me. I've heard him speak four times and I've never heard him speak when he didn't talk about his mother's love. He spends a lot of time alone in meditation. When he-- he doesn't say, "I think about my mother and I realize she loved me." He says, "When I meditate I feel my mother's love. I feel my mother's love. And it helps me and comforts me." And he teaches his monks when they get scared to turn around and call and shout "Mother!" Can you imagine, can you imagine a world where, where we got scared, rather than get aggressive, we'd all turn around and just say a little prayer to our mothers? Hmm, intere-- a bit tricky though cuz my mother was a, a brassy English barmaid. And what's, what's the most aggressive human being I ever met in my life so there you go. Still, nice idea, right? Nice idea. Okay. So I want to just click into attachment and I'm not gonna talk to you a lot about it because if you read my work it's all over it. In fact, I'm starting to think I shouldn't call myself a couples therapist anymore. I should call myself an attachment therapist, researcher, whatever because it's so, uhm, it's so co-opt in what we do. And half of the time I'm at conferences with attachment folks with developmental people. So I think I'm gonna give you a very fast thing cuz we're gonna need to have coffee and then play a little bit of exercise. Uhm, as a segue into attachment, this was on the internet, a surgeon. Putting on the internet, he said this moment changed his life. He said that he used to operate on fetuses in utero. Operate on fetuses in utero. He said, and then one day in the OR this little hand reached out of the mother's womb and grabbed onto his finger and would not let go. And he said that changed everything for him. He realized that this was a little human being and there's no human being had needs and this, this hand reached out and grabbed, it would not let go and John Paul would have said absolutely. John Paul have said this is the most powerful motivator in man which is why we should use it in couples therapy. This is the most powerful motivator in man. This need for connection to get a response from another human being, to be able to turn and reach and have the other human being respond to us to reach and feel that somebody else is there. That is the most powerful, uhm, thing that we need. 

01:15:30
Code of attachment tells us: Primary need is "felt security" with other A safe haven - to go to A secure base - to go out from "ARE you there for me?" Are you Accessible - Do I matter? Are you Responsive to my need - Can I depend? Are you Engaged with me? Emotional presence is "solution" 

01:15:30
SUE JOHNSON So what do we know? The code of attachment tells us that our primary need is felt security with o-- with another. A safe haven, to go to. A secure base, to go out from. It basically says the most key question in couples is, "Are you there for me?" And I can hear this question in every fight the couple bring in to, to session. "Are you there for me? Are you accessible? Do I matter to you? Can I reach for you? Will you hear me? Are you responsive to my need? Can I depend on you? Are you engaged with me?" From this point of view, emotional presence is the solution to so many couples problems. You know, there's a beautiful phrase, and I think it's in Robert Carron's book on becoming attached. We just talks about the history of attachment. And what he talks about is what attachment says is in love you don't have to be perfect or clever or skilled or funny, you just have to be there. It's emotional presence. And it's so distressing sometimes for me to see so many couples come in where particularly men are trying to be the perfect husband. They're trying to perform. And when they hear criticism from their partner that they can't perform, they withdraw. And what they don't realize is that their partner doesn't need a perfect performance, their partner needs them. So it's just fine to say to somebody, "I see you're hurting and I don't want you to hurt. And I love you and I don't want you to hurt and I don't know what to do right now." I remember a man doing that in my office and his wife said, "Oh, how sweet. I burst into tears." And hide to me and he looked at me like, "Go figure." What just happened? And that's reasonable cuz we teach men to be obsessed with performance. All right. We've never-- we don't really teach men. Actually, the greatest gift you have is just you, your presence. And if you give that, that in itself soothes your partner just in a way that's true with the-- a parent and child. So instead of talking to you about all the rules and laws of attachment, to talking to you about how we-- ah, talking to you about separation distress, safe haven, and secure base, but how some of us can reach that se-- a secure strategy. Some of us get anxious and yell and scream and demand because we really aren't sure that the person is gonna hear us if we don't do that. And some of us habitually say, "Nobody's gonna be there for me anyway. I must give up on this. I'm gonna shut down my needs and withdraw particularly when I'm vulnerable or when my partner is vulnerable." Those are three basic attachment strategies but I'm gonna show them to in a more concrete way because we're running out of time. I'm gonna show them to you in a movie. Let's look at Ed Tronick. This is two minutes. If I can get it to work. And, uhm, this is two minutes and it's talking about still face and it's on the internet, it's on YouTube. 

01:18:45
Edward Tronick, Ph.D. Director Child Development Unit Harvard University The "Still Face" Experiment 

01:18:45
EDWARD TRONICK Babies these young are extremely responsive to the emotions and the reactivity and the social interaction that they get from the world around them. This is something that we started studying around 34 years ago when people didn't think that infants could engage in social interaction. In this Still Face experiment what the mother did was she sits down and she's playing with her baby who's about a year of age. And she gives a greeting to the baby, the baby gives a greeting back to her. This baby starts pointing at different places in the world and the mother is trying to engage with her and play her. They're working to coordinate their emotions and their intentions what they want to do in the world. And that's really what the baby is used to. And then we ask the mother to not respond to the baby. The baby very quickly picks up on this and then she uses all of her abilities to try and get the mother back. She smiles at the mother. She points because she's used to the mother looking where she points. The baby puts both hands up in front of her and says, "What's happening here?" She makes that screechy sound at the mother like, "Come on. Why, why aren't we doing this?" Even in these two minutes when they don't get the normal reaction they react with negative emotions, they turn away, they feel the stress of it. They actually may lose control of their posture because of the stress that they're experiencing. 

01:20:50
UNKNOWN Okay. Okay. I'm here. And what are you doing? Oh, yes. Oh, it would be grand. 

01:21:00
EDWARD TRONICK It's a little like the good, the bad, and the ugly. The good is the normal stuff that goes on that we all do with our kids. The bad is when something bad happened, but the infant can over comment after all when you stopped the still face the mother and the baby start to play again. The ugly is when you don't give the child any chance to get back to the good. There's no reparation and they're stuck in that really ugly situation. 

01:21:35
SUE JOHNSON So what I want you to notice there is you could use that clip ad nauseam to teach couples therapy. The same thing happens. Only it sounds different in adults. And the baby goes, "Ah!" In adults it sounds like, "You were late!" All right. Or it sounds like, "All you want is an orgasm." All right. It sounds like that. It's a protest but it sounds different. And in some ways, it's much harder to interpret in adults cuz we got all kinds of content in there. Notice the other thing the baby does. The baby does this. I turn away to try and regulate my emotion. All right, but imagine if you keep doing that then the other person feels shut out and starts to get, ah, freaked out. Please notice that always happen just because the mother stopped responding. This is how exquisitely tuned in we are to cues from attachment figures. This is why we've missed so much of the nuisances of this music cuz we haven't known how to pay attention on this kind of level of emotional engagement. Then notice that the baby goes into primal panic, has a complete meltdown. And notice how disorganizing that is. You know, and I think one of the things that adult lovers say is when things are going wrong it's like they just get lost, they're drowning, they're just-- they can't figure out what's going wrong. You know, I have couples say to me like, "I'm so angry and I don't even know why I'm so angry all the time. What you-- she says these things to me. I don't even know what she's talking about. I don't, I don't understand what's going on here. I don't even understand why I'm hurt so much. People just get totally lost in this cuz they don't understand that this is the scenario they're going through and they get stuck in the ugly. I want you to notice that what you saw was repair. The mother reached, and look what she did. She just softened her voice, opened up her face, and reached for the baby and then the baby responded, and it's okay. All right. And that's what securely attached couples could do as well. 

01:23:50
Attachment Theory and Couples Therapy This perspective offers: A map to the territory of distress and relationship. A focus - a compass in internal emotional moments and interpersonal dramas. A picture of transforming moves and moments in the process of the shaping of a secure bond. A goal for therapy - an end point. Not just conflict containment. 

01:23:50
SUE JOHNSON So I'm skipping over all this. I'm skipping over things like sex. There's another talk, okay? But let's just say that in adult sex is a bonding, a bonding activity most of the time. So to separate sex and, sex and, uhm, attachment, I think it's very fascinating. We do though we separate sex and emotion, sex and attachment. It seems to me that if you take the emotion out of sex and the attachment out of sex, it's like dancing when there's no music in the room. But we're going to that later. Okay. So attachment theory tuned you into what matters? To the key elements. The organizing elements. The organizing emotions. It tuned you into the key organizing elements so that you can start to shift them. All right. A good alliance is necessary. Safety is necessary but it's not sufficient. If you're gonna create lasting change, you've got is move into this attachment emotional channel and start to shift what is going on there. This perspective offers a map to the territory of distress and relationship, a focus, a compass in the internal emotional moments and dramas, a picture of transforming moves and moments in the process of shaping a secure bond, and a goal for therapy which is not just conflict containment. That's not good enough. We have a science of relationships now. We can do a lot better than that. 

01:25:20
Three conditions for lasting change in EFT: 1. Secure Base in Session Collaborative alliance - emotional presence/responsiveness Relentless empathy - suspension of judgment - curiosity 2. Deepen Emotion Trust - Move into - Stay with Corrective processing, regulating 3. A.R.E. conversations Enactments evoking mutual responsiveness Predict reliable relationship repair by end of therapy 

01:25:20
SUE JOHNSON So I'm going to not do any of that. And I'm not gonna talk on interventions. I'm gonna go to here. And I'm just gonna say something before we go for coffee, I believe. Yes. So what am I talking about here? I'm talking about three conditions for lasting change. And I've put it in attachment terms rather than talking about alliance per se. The therapist creates a secure base in the session with the collaborative alliance. The therapist is emotionally present and responsive. EFT is a way of seeing relationships as attachment bonds. It's a way of intervening. It's pretty systematic. We can tell you in our trainings exactly how to deal with emotions, how to deal with negative interactions. But in the end, EFT is not just a way of seeing relationships and people and a way of intervening, it's a way of being with people. In order to do EFT you have to be willing to be emotionally present in the session. You can do this stuff from a distance. So collaborative alliance. And by the way, if you're not emotionally present in this session, your clients won't be either. They pick up on that. They'll imitate you. So emotional presence and responsiveness and what we call relentless empathy which I really think comes from curiosity. Could you tell me how that works? You're incredibly angry with me right now and I don't understand why. Could you help me understand that? So creating a secure base so that people can get their emotional balance and look at what's going on deepening in emotion, moving into it, staying with it, helping people order it and process it and regulate it and creating what we call ARE conversations, accessible responsive engaged conversations where people are mutually responsive. And those conversations I'm talking to you about in nine studies including the last big bonding study we did which included the FMRIPs. Those conversations in our therapy pro-- we predict being out of distress at the end of therapy and predict good followup and secure bonding years later. Okay. So now I'm gonna stop. Can we have a 10-minute coffee because I've been told I mustn't make you sit here for three hours. Uhm, so can we have a 10-minute coffee and then when we come back we can watch a ta-- and we're gonna do an exercise, watch a tape and do a little bit more talking. So 10 minutes, folks, let's keep it please. Okay, folks, can we go please? We're losing our time.

01:28:20
SUE JOHNSON Uhm, people have been asking me. I'm just gonna say it again for everyone. If you're interested in training, our finding in EFT therapist or training etcetera, the website you go to is the one that was on the first slide, www.iceeft.com, the International Center for Excellence in Emotionally Focused Therapy, iceeft.com. There's about 30 centers in EFT all over the States. Okay. If you go on that website you can find the therapist by area, you can find the therapist, you can find trainings. There's trainings all over the U.S. and in Europe. They're all over the world right now. So you can-- if you want to see a DV-- a clip on YouTube about the study, you can go on YouTube. We uploaded it literally 24 hours ago just before I got on the plane. We up-- to come here, we uploaded it. And if you want-- or if you don't wanna go to YouTube, you can go to the new website, drsuejohnson.com. Okay, drsuejohnson.com and you can see some clips there, and one of them I believe it's a writ-- I believe-- I hope I'm telling the truth here, I think it's uploaded onto that site already. I hope so. If not, you've got to find it on YouTube. Or maybe they're a bit slow. But the, the DVD about the study is also on that site. And if you want to read the study, it's in Plus One, P-L-U-S-O-N-E, and that is, uhm, an online free access journal which is scientific journal which is why we publish there. Anyone can get free access to that study.

(Lloyd Shearer) Most Basic EFT Intervention: Empathic Reflection • Creates safety • Focuses and slow processing • Better organizes & distills experience - creates coherence 

01:30:15
SUE JOHNSON Okay. So I'm just gonna say a few words and then we're gonna do an exercise and look at a tape. So I wanna emphasize that in this therapy emotional responsiveness on the part of the therapist who models it and sets up an environment for it and on the part of teaching the couple to do it with each other is the essence of this, the heart of this change that you're gonna create, the empathic responsiveness of the therapist creates safety and the goal is to guide partners into res-- this responsiveness with each other. And if you like the value statement behind this, with a mission on value statement in EFT is, "Resolve to be tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and tolerant with the weak and the wrong. Sometime in your life you will have been all of these." This is a-- we are all turkeys in the same turkey soup type therapy. Not a, "I want to be a magical expert type therapy." We are all the human beings struggling to deal with our existential needs of fears. We're all human beings getting caught in the relationships, losing our way, uhm, somehow pushing the people we love away just when we need them the most, getting stuck in, uhm, doing things to actually have us less likely to connect with our partner. We're all struggling with these needs. We're all figuring out how to deal with them. Okay. Only now we are starting to have actually a science of everyday life and everyday dealing with emotions. We're starting to e-- ah, at last, we're striving to deal with that. When I first came into this field I was told, uhm, you know, if you want to be psychologists-- psychologist really we don't deal with this vague, soft, maybe these things like emotions. We certainly don't wanna talk about love. Absolutely, right? And, uhm, we'd come a long way, all right, we're still really sort of understanding that because after all it's the fabric, our intimate relationships of the most precious things in our lives. Why wouldn't we study these things? So what EFT-- the most basic EFT intervention is empathic reflection. It creates safety. It focuses and slows processes-- processing and it organizes and distills experience. It makes sense of people's experience. And what you can make sense of, you're staying with, and you process, it creates coherence. Okay. And then people can stay and engage with their experience. So clearly attached people help each other do that. They support each other in interactions so, so they can stay present and help each other process experience.

Deepening Emotion in the Present: beyond reactive or numb • Find and Focus. Grasp Handles; • Hold/Repeat, Block Exits; • Order, Elements become Coherent Whole; • Distil - attachment/existential Meanings & Messages; • Link to Action - active Construction of inner and outer worlds; • Validate - promote ownership - effects. ((not labeling, ventilating, explaining, interpreting, coaching)) 

01:33:20
SUE JOHNSON All right. So what we're talking about here is in this we're gonna do an exercise. Deepening emotion in the present beyond reactive or numb. This-- I probably didn't send this to Jeff to put on the website because, uhm, I only did it about two weeks ago. So, uhm, I will ask the institute to put up these slides for you so you can have them, okay? Deepening emotion in the present. You have to find the emotion and focus on it. You have to grasp the handles people give you. Use your own emotion. Feel. When somebody says the word when you go, "Oh!" You stay with it. Or when somebody says the word that it brings tears to your eyes or you go, "Oh right," you stay with it. So somebody says, "Not and not and not and not and not." And when you talk like that I feel completely shattered, "Not and not and not and not and not." You go, "Excuse me, what is that?" Shattered. That's a powerful word. How-- well somebody says, "I'm drowning here. I'm drowning." Drowning? I write those words down. I use in the game and the game their handles into people's emotional lives. So you focus and you use those handles. You hold and repeat. And you're gonna see me doing that in a tape. You repeat things. People-- you know, people say their emotion really fast. They put their right on the money and then they just wisp passed it. You go back and you repeat it and you block exits. You order the emotion by continuing to reflect it by repeating it so that they can taste it and feel it and stay with it and starts to make sense to them. And you distill the meanings. So can you help me? When you shut down like you do, like, like you're doing right now, what you say to yourself and your mind is, "She doesn't want me. Even when we walk down the aisle I knew I couldn't please her. I don't deserve her. I don't know how to do this. She'll leave me. It's just a matter of time. I've lost her already. This is hopeless. I might as well just stand here and be silent cuz it's hopeless, I've lost her." That's what you say to yourself. All right. And you help him tune in to those meanings that he puts together that leads him struck, dumb, and mute in front of her. And ironically creates her rage and her panic and actually drives her away from him. You link things to action. You say, "So then of course you shut down." And he says, "Yes, I do shut down." All right. But then when you get him in touch with how much he longs for her validation and her reassurance, his whole body moves towards her. You link into action. "And can we tell her right now what it's like to let yourself feel that longing for your wife even if some part of you says you don't deserve it. Can you tell her?" And you help him say that. You help him move it into action and you always validate. You validate people.

SUE JOHNSON People need to know that what they feel is not crazy and is not bad, and is not stupid and is not unique so that they are the only strange, weird person, crazy person in this planet that feels this way. People need to know. They're just human beings struggling with an enormous drama. They get lost. They're gonna step on their part-- if you think about it in dancing, it's a wonderful metaphor. All right. If I don't saw somebody even in experienced dance, so I'm gonna miss their cues, I'm gonna step to the left instead of the right and mess up what they're trying to do. I'm gonna step on their foot. I'm gonna lose my balance at the last minute and I'm gonna twist my body so it's put them off balance and so they hurt themselves. It's gonna happen. It's gonna happen. We're just all struggling with this, right? And understanding what to do next and have the turn back and help each other rebalance.

EMOTION: Trigger - Initial Perception - Body arousal - Reappraisal/Meaning (models - self and other - cycles, identity, attachment) - Action, tendency. W: You are so difficult - I can't tolerate your attitude. H: (Throws up his hands and turns to look out the window). Th: What happens to you as your wife says "...."? H: Nothing - I am used to this. She says this stuff all the time. Th: You feel nothing as she says "....."? (Repeat cue) H: This happens lots - I just try to roll with it - forget it - (Shifts to coping) Th: You try to forget these times when she tells you that you are too difficult for her to tolerate? (he nods) But in that split second before you try to push it aside and "forget" her words - what happens to you? When she tells you, you are too difficult? H: Don't know. I just move away. Th: There is something here that is hard? - upsetting? - you can't take it in - that is too hard? (he nods) What do you hear her say? H: (Appraisal - threat). She's saying that I'm hopeless - this relationship is doomed - down the tubes. Th: (Body arousal) You threw up your hands - like this - that is the hopelessness, the defeat? H: I guess so - yes - Th: It's like you throw up your hands and you give up - it's hopeless. H: Yeah (looks down at shoes - quiet voice) There is nothing I can do. H: Yep. I have totally blown it. I'll never make it with her. She has her standards and I can't....I'll never....(tears). Th: (Action tendency) So you withdraw to protect yourself. And then you (the wife) get even angrier (she nods) and that is the cycle that has taken over the relationship and leaves you both alone (attachment significance) And that brings tears for you? H: No - my eyes are just watering... Th: You say to yourself - "I have blown it - lost her - I'll never make it with her? Some part of you wants to throw up your hands - like "I'll never please her - have her love" - is that it? H: Right - my brother said - there is a time you get married and he told me I was too young - but you do what you do - all my family got married young (exit) Th: I'd like to go back - So when you hear your wife's anger you move away - try to forget it - and she sees - what did she say? She sees "coldness" and "indifference" (she nods). But in fact, you are trying to deal with a huge sense of defeat and hopelessness - a sense of failure - a fear that you can never please her - H: Yes - that's it - I think that's it - Th: (Enactment) Can you tell her please - W: I do get critical - I do. Well anyone would. He just acts like he is a house guest, a visitor. He goes off to his room on his computer and he works. And it's been that way for ever. Like last night, you just disappeared!!! (Points at him, then crosses her arms across her chest and rocks and looks as if she could cry) the invisible man - my husband.

SUE JOHNSON So what we're not doing is labeling, helping people ventilate. Ventilation catharsis comes from the Greek word for diarrhea. Explaining, interpreting, and coaching. We don't see those as, uhm, necessary or a particularly efficient way to create change. And what we're trying to do is reorganize people's experience and I'm gonna cut that slide and go straight to here. So you're gonna do an exercise here with me and you're gonna do it with the person next to you. But first of all, I want you to stay with me while we read this. Do you remember I talked about the emotion as having a trigger? A perception? Right? Body arousal, meaning and action. Okay. So here we go. This is me with the shut down man. Wife, "You are so difficult, I can't tolerate your attitude." He throws up his hands and turns to look out the window. "What happens to you as your wife says "You are so difficult. I can't tolerate your attitude"? I take the cue and I presented again. "What happens to you?" Because something happened because he moved away, right? "Nothing." Now, if he's not dead, and he's not a lizard, if he's a mammal, that's impossible. Because I know it's impossible, all I have to do is stay with it. Well sometimes, we actually believe people. We feel nothing, no, no. It's just that he's working really hard to push it down. So all I got to do is interfere with his ability to work hard to push it down. All right. "Nothing. I am used to this. She says this stuff all the time." I just repeated, "You feel nothing as she says "You are so difficult, I can't tolerate your attitude"? "This happens lots, I just try to roll with it, I forget it." He tells me how he copes with it. All right. That will do. I'll take that and I'll put it together. If somebody gives me-- I want them to step. But if they give me a quarter of an inch, I'll reflect the quarter of an inch because then they'll give me another and another and another. So I say, "So you try to forget these times when she tells you," and I present the cue again, "that you are too difficult for her to tolerate? But in that split second before you try to push it aside and forget her words," cuz that takes effort, "what happens to you?" The fourth time, "when she tells you, you are too difficult?" I present the cue. "I don't know. I just move away." He gives me the action tendency. "I move away." Hey, we're getting along, we're getting the elements here." Now if you move away, there's an implication for meaning there. So I'll go with it. "There is something here that is hard?" That's an interpretation. I lot EFT, very small. "Upsetting? You can't take it in, that is too hard?" He nods. "What do you hear her say?" I'm going for the meaning and look what he gives me. From "nothing" he gives me, "She's saying that I'm hopeless. This is relationship is doomed. It's down the tubes." That's what he doesn't wanna feel, right. And also add in the body arousal. "So you threw up your hands like this, yeah, that's the hopelessness, the defeat? "I guess so, yes." And I say again, "So it's like you throw up your hands and you give up. It's hopeless. That's what withdrawers do. They say, "I'll just stand still because I'm in danger and everything I do makes it worse so I'll just stand completely still. I'll go immobile." "Yeah. There is nothing I can do. I have totally blown it. I'll never make it with her. She has her standards and I can't, I'll never," And he tears. Please notice how fast he's come because I just focused on the elements and stayed with him. So and I go with the action tendency and I wanna connect it with his behavior in the relationship because she's sitting listening to me. So I need to bring her in. "So you withdraw to protect yourself. And then you get even angrier. And that's the cycle that's taken over the relationship and leaves you both alone." Please note I make the dance of disconnection, the enemy, not the other person. That's a big fact reframe and it's the hold of the first stage of EFT. We de-escalate the negative cycle. And one of the main ways we do that is we make the dance that they're courting, the dance of disconnection and self-protection, the enemy, not the other person. "So that's the cycle that's taken over the relationship and leaves you both alone." And I'm talking about attachment here. And then I go back to his affect. "And that brings tears for you?" And this time, he's, he's decided that, uhm, we're getting too close here so he says, "No, my eyes are just watering." And when people do exits like that, you don't have to do anything, you just stay. You say to yourself, I just-- I use proxy voice. I speak as if I'm him but I give him back what he's already told me. You say so he's listening to a tape of himself. All right, but I'm taking in back into his emotion. "You say to yourself, I have blown it, I've lost her, I'll never make it with her. Some part of you wants to throw up your hands, like, I'll never have her love, is that it? "Right. My brother said there is a time when you get married and he told me I was too young, but what do you do, all of your-- all my family got married young." That's an exit. And you decide whether you're gonna let him take it though. If it's the first session, you let him take it. I don't want him to take it. So, "I'd like to go back. When you hear your wife's anger," I'm gonna put it altogether and make it coherent for him so he can stay engaged with it. "When you hear your wife's anger you move away, try to forget it, and she sees-- what did she say? She sees coldness and indifference. But in fact, you're trying to deal with this huge sense of defeat and hopelessness, a sense of failure, a fear you can never please her." "Yes. That's it. I think that's it." "Can you tell her please?" Now that's me going in and unpacking, or you could say if you like co-creating, or whatever word you wanna use, that's me going in and distilling and getting somebody into their emotion. Everybody got me? And really, you know, it's a lot of reflections and questions, but please notice it matters how I do it. If I do it fast and in a high voice, and don't repeat myself it won't work, does everybody know what I mean? Okay. I can say nonsense to you, okay, in a slow low voice and I'll hold your attention. You believe what I believe? Immobile? Immobile? Kept down here. If you talk to people about the most deep things in the high loud voice, it seems to me that you feel like an incredible fame in here and you're nothing-- you feel like nothing you could do will help and absolutely nothing will do, so of course it makes obvious sense they'll withdraw. The answer is yes. Nothing's happened. You have to go to the level of engagement with the emotion. You have to engage the emotion for this. You have to go into the music to change it. The music has to be playing for a new step to happen. So if you go, that's why I say to people, "If you want to learn EFT, watch your tapes." I mean, none of us want to watch our own tapes. Watch your tapes because you don't know how you do things and that really matters here. Okay. So, what I'd like to do, or maybe you can-- uhm, with a partner, you can write down the elements of emotion. They are-- or maybe you can just write them down. A cue. A cue, a basic perception. Often that's implicit. It's just sort of you hear it in people's voices the way they talk but they don't actually say this feels battle, this feels dangerous. A cue, a perception, body-- what the body does, the meaning for the relationship. I'm gonna be rejected, I'm gonna be abandoned, what his person is gonna do, the meaning and the resulting action. What do I do? Do you I turn towa-- towards this person? Do I freeze and give up and stonewall? Do I just turn away and go out with the boys? What do I do? What do I do in the dance? How does the emotion move me to act in, in the dance in the relationship? Okay. So what I would like you to do for just a few minutes with the person next to you is I want you, and it shouldn't ram on like this, uhm, basically about 20 minutes later the wife, in the same session the wife says this. And what I want you to do with your partner is go into these five lines and find the elements of the emotion and just try to formulate how you would reflect those elements back to her in the session, what you would say? How would you reflect it back in a way that might help her li-- turn and give her partner a new message? It's-- we're just playing here, okay? So the woman says-- the wife says, "Well I do get critical, I do. Well anyone would. He acts like he's a house guest, a visitor. He goes off to his room on his computer and he works. And it's been that way for ever." People talk about survival stuff in terms of life and death. When you're afraid, there's no room for gray. You've got to have everything in black and white. And it's been that way forever. "Like last night," notice what she does because it's two things, "Last night, you just disappeared!!!" She points and then she rocks. "You just disappeared!!!" She crosses her arms across her chest and looks as if she could cry, "The invisible man, my husband." Okay. So what I want you to do is with a partner spend five minutes finding the elements of the emotion in what she says and telling just playing with how you would maybe pick up a couple of those elements, if you're ambitious try to put them all together, it's up to you, and just reflect them back to her in a way that she starts to taste the emotional experience. Everybody got it? Go for it. Five minutes. Okay. Yohoohoo! Well you guys didn't get in to that at all, did you? Okay. So if we had lots of time I'd hear all your responses. But let's not do that because I'm gonna show you a DVD. But if I was there, there's, there's no right and perfect way, you could say lots of things. But if I was there, I would start with what's the most obvious which is she's talking about getting critical and pointing and her body is really obvious. So I might start with the action tendency. She says, "I get critical. That's what happens in the cycle." All right, and her body. So I'm not, I'm not to say because if you think about it the surface affect that she starts off with his anger. But it's really obvious that the underlying emotion is all about the fear of abandonment and the pain of being left. All right, that's really obvious. So what I might say something like, "So could you help me?" And I usually start with that because I always say it tentatively so that people feel they have the power to correct me. All right. I will change it. "So you could you help me?" You sound angry right now and you're pointing at him. But when I look at your face, it's obvious that there's something here that's painful. All right. So I don't say it's obviously here that you have a deep fear of rejection and abandonment. You've-- that's too far. We talk about the emotion engagement. You have to keep the person with you so you stay close to their experience and you go just a quarter of an inch more. If you go too far and you get to abstract and explanatory, you lose them. All right. You stay. Keep them emotionally engaged. So you say, "So you sound angry but as I look on your face this is incredibly painful for you to live with somebody and trying to love somebody who from your point of view can just disappear on you. They seem so distant. They can just disappear like you don't matter. They can just-- somehow, you can't even see them anymore. That must be so painful and then you're all by yourself. And I notice I say seemed because I don't want him to hear that I believe that he's doing that. And I go for the attachment significant you're all by yourself. I just wanted to stay with this and process it further. Everybody got me? Okay. So I'm deep, I'm going to the, the primary affect and I'm staying on that level. So now what I want us to do is look at a piece of tape. And this is me training take five. You can go on the ICEEFT website and find all the training tapes. This is me, it's called a training tape called the engaging withdrawers. This is John(ph) and Julie(ph). John(ph) is the withdrawer. I'm not gonna tell you much about them. Julie(ph) has been very angry with him. Uhm, they got to the point where which he would-- she would talk to him about the relationship. He would withdraw into silence for days of the time then she would come and find him in the garage and she would use the D word. She'd say, "I'm gonna divorce you." And then he'd explode. And that was even worst for her. That would scare the hell a lot of us so she-- then she'd go away, everything would seem down, then it will start again. And by the time they kind of EFT, this is session eight, I'm doing a consultation, a live session which we always do it for the externships which is the basic in EFT before the externships. That happen all over the world, all over North America. Okay. So this is me working with, with John(ph). And what's happened in the seven sessions that the therapist has had with them is the therapist has talked to them about their pattern and their cycle, help them understand their emotions a little more and Julie(ph) has really started to shift and started to understand that yes they're caught in this dreadful pattern where she demands and criticizes and he shuts down. And she started to really soften and come out and be much more accessible. And what he said to me is, "But I can't get any way with John(ph) because John(ph) has been to therapy for ever and he can talk about his emotions but he never seems to feel them." So I say, "So what do you want me to do?" So I want you to go and do step three of EFT which is acci-- ah, accessing the underlying attachment emotions underneath this man steps in this cycle. So let's watch me do this. It's about 20 minutes long. So I'm gonna let it run so you can really see how it progresses, okay? And then we'll say a few words to finish up. All right. 

01:55:00
[sil.] 

01:55:10
JOHN When I see any sign in her of her having something that, that makes me think she's ill or frail, I used to get really angry. 

01:55:20
SUE JOHNSON Uh-hmm. 

01:55:20
JOHN Yeah. 

01:55:20
SUE JOHNSON Because for you it meant-- it was dangerous signal. 

01:55:25
SUE JOHNSON All right. Help. 

01:55:25
SUE JOHNSON For you it meant, "Oh my goodness." 

01:55:25
JOHN Yeah. 

01:55:25
SUE JOHNSON Maybe this will gonna happen again. All right. 

01:55:30
JOHN I was-- and, and I was... 

01:55:30
SUE JOHNSON Julie(ph)-- ah, you know, Julie(ph) is gonna get-- you know, somehow she's gonna disappear on me. 

01:55:35
JOHN Yeah. 

01:55:35
SUE JOHNSON She's going-- this is the beginning of me losing her, right? 

01:55:35
JOHN Yes. 

01:55:35
SUE JOHNSON And so you rather than maybe just being able to go to her and comfort her you'd be all caught up in your own fear, yeah? And this is gonna happen again, yeah? 

01:55:45
JOHN And, and actually that's what was on it either. I was caught up in my anger. 

01:55:50
SUE JOHNSON I really can't do that. 

01:55:55
SUE JOHNSON I hate technology. 

01:56:00
[sil.] 

01:56:15
SUE JOHNSON Going to a computer, going to a DVD. You're gonna do it? 

01:56:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, it just never showed up though. 

01:56:20
SUE JOHNSON But it usually does. Yeah, close that. 

01:56:25
UNKNOWN I also thought about that. You wanna close it quickly? 

01:56:25
SUE JOHNSON Why don't you do that? Okay. And then put up. Here, that's true. Again. Have you? 

01:56:35
UNKNOWN Sounds clear now. 

01:56:35
JOHN There's things that like I lost my mom when I was four. She-- I don't know, do the listeners know our background at all? 

01:56:45
SUE JOHNSON A little bit, yes. 

01:56:50
JOHN You know, she... 

01:56:50
JULIE You're not four. 

01:56:50
SUE JOHNSON I know, I know, I know that your mom... 

01:56:50
JOHN Fourth grade, fourth grade. 

01:56:55
JULIE Yeah. 

01:56:55
SUE JOHNSON I know that your mom was depressed and when moms are depressed it's pretty difficult for them to really pay the kind of attention that little kids need. 

01:57:00
JOHN Well... 

01:57:00
SUE JOHNSON And then I know that she was-- had shock therapy. 

01:57:05
JOHN Yeah. 

01:57:05
SUE JOHNSON And that from your point of view that, that she just kind of exited. 

01:57:05
JOHN Oh, she was a zombie. 

01:57:10
JULIE Literally, yeah. 

01:57:10
JOHN She was a zombie, literally. She just sat there and smoke cigarettes. I'm just scared and let us do it anyway. Anyways, when I see any sign in her of her having something that that makes me think she's ill or frail, I used to get really angry, you know. 

01:57:25
SUE JOHNSON Uh-hmm. Because for you it meant-- it was a dangerous signal. For you it meant, oh my goodness - 

01:57:30
JOHN Yeah. 

01:57:30
SUE JOHNSON - maybe this is gonna happen again. 

01:57:35
JOHN I was-- and, and I was... 

01:57:35
SUE JOHNSON Right? Julie(ph)-- you know, Julie(ph) is gonna get-- you know, somehow she's gonna disappear on me. 

01:57:40
JOHN Yeah. 

01:57:40
SUE JOHNSON She's going-- this is the beginning of me losing her, right? 

01:57:45
JOHN Yes. 

01:57:45
SUE JOHNSON And so you rather than maybe just being able to go to her and comfort her you'd be all caught up in your own fear, yeah? That this is gonna happen again, yeah? 

01:57:55
JOHN And, and actually, that's what was on it either. I was caught in my anger which is really inappropriate because I thought as, "You know what, you're just not taking care of yourself," because that's how I saw with my mom. You know, if you'd only just take care of yourself. 

01:58:05
JULIE Then he'd get very critical of me like, "No wonder you're sick. I saw you go out with Melissa(ph) this week." And, and I'm like, "Oh my-- what? Oh my God!" Like I felt like I suddenly got sort of getting attacked. And I thought it was because he was a quote unquote, "jerk." I didn't realized it. He was feeling like all this abandonment, you know. So it was... 

01:58:25
JOHN So just, just that one little thing. There's a handful of other things. But just knowing that, when I started feeling that anger, I started thinking about and, and, and all of a sudden I could say, "Okay, I'm not really that angry about it. Maybe I'm not that angry cuz then she does take care of herself." Or I don't know something like that, I guess. 

01:58:45
SUE JOHNSON Uh-hmm. 

01:58:45
JOHN And this does not diffuses, it's just recalling. 

01:58:45
SUE JOHNSON Understanding that maybe, uhm, there's a moment of anger but that that isn't the main show in town. 

01:58:55
JOHN Yeah, yeah. 

01:58:55
SUE JOHNSON That isn't the main-- the thing that's really going on, slowing it down, so that you understand that in the second before you get that angry response there's something else happening that's kind of bigger and deeper. 

01:59:05
JOHN Yeah. 

01:59:10
SUE JOHNSON Absolutely. 

01:59:10
JOHN So, and we're at the point where I just took at the angry response, I'm still angry for a little while, and but pretty quickly kind of wheel it back and then realize that it's just the superficial thing. Well, it's a really deep thing but it's the anger superficial. 

01:59:25
SUE JOHNSON Uh-hmm. 

01:59:30
JOHN And, ah... 

01:59:30
SUE JOHNSON And it do-- you don't just stay in it or, or, or climb out now. You don't-- ah, the two alternatives aren't just to get angry and snap at her - 

01:59:35
JOHN Yeah. 

01:59:40
SUE JOHNSON - or to shut down. There's a third one in the middle which is something to do with, wait a minute, you can actually sort of reflect on what's happening and say, "Wait a minute, what's happening here?" 

01:59:50
JOHN I can almost sit back and, and push the anger side a little bit and, and feel the fear - 

01:59:55
SUE JOHNSON Can you? 

01:59:55
JOHN - which I couldn't feel before, you know what I mean? 

01:59:55
SUE JOHNSON Can you? 

01:59:55
JOHN Yeah. 

02:00:00
SUE JOHNSON And what does, what does that fear feel like? 

02:00:00
JOHN It's pretty bad. It feels bad. But I, I let it out. I let it-- and I feel a little bit and it's just-- I don't know, it makes me more compassionate or something. It just chills me out in the way to just feel it, you know. 

02:00:15
SUE JOHNSON So John(ph), can you help me? I'd like to understand that fear that comes up for you a little bit because it's so important, right? This incredibly strong feelings that you two guys are learning to look at and have so much courage to be able to look at and talk about, right? Uhm, I mean, these feelings are pretty important cuz they're kind of the music of this dance that the two of you get caught in, right? And what we're gonna do-- what we're doing already-- what we're doing is helping you step out of this dance and then we're gonna help you create a dance that has a whole lot more trust and closeness and connection in it, right? 

02:00:50
JOHN Uh-hmm. 

02:00:50
SUE JOHNSON I tell him what we're doing. 

02:00:50
SUE JOHNSON But I wanna go back here a minute. Can you help me? What does that fear feel like for you then? You're saying to me if I'm here in your right, you're saying, "Sue, I'm starting to understand how this fear comes and grabs me by the throat. And the way I deal with it is to snap which starts a whole dreadful dance," right? And Julie(ph) cuz it's so scary for her. 

02:01:15
JOHN Yeah, yeah. 

02:01:15
SUE JOHNSON Or to just shut down which is also scary for Julie(ph) cuz then she doesn't have me as a partner, right? 

02:01:25
JOHN Yeah, yeah. 

02:01:25
SUE JOHNSON And that's what I do with it. Ah, I'm just really starting to understand how powerful this fear is. I sort of know that it kind of comes from my mom, right? 

02:01:35
JOHN Yeah. 

02:01:35
SUE JOHNSON That, that when I-- the person I really needed in the whole world, that I needed when I was little, right, just sort of disappeared on me, became a zombie. A sort of known that, right. Well, what does that feel-- fear feel like for you when it's coming up? Do you know? What does it feel like? What does it feel like in your body? 

02:02:00
JOHN Well that's exactly what coordinate-- the coordin-- it's crazy. It always says, well, where do you feel that? 

02:02:05
SUE JOHNSON Yes. 

02:02:05
JOHN What color is it? 

02:02:10
SUE JOHNSON Yes. 

02:02:10
JOHN And a few things like that. Can you feel calmness? Where do you feel that? What color is that? And in here, the moment I don't know if I go to that level but he's made me feel-- it's always in here like sort of necessary for me. And, and or... 

02:02:25
SUE JOHNSON It's right underneath you-- it's right underneath your heart. It's like a band... 

02:02:30
JOHN It's kind of my heart a little bit and down here, yeah. 

02:02:35
SUE JOHNSON And then your stomach, and what does it feel like. It's a... 

02:02:35
JOHN So, so just having touch that in the sessions, you know, he-- I, I, I have to confront that part of my body in these sessions when we get talking about this stuff. And so I, I, I guess I sort of just remember that. I just come and go back and-- or there's, there's that feeling. 

02:02:50
SUE JOHNSON It feels so... 

02:02:50
JOHN Okay. There's that feeling. 

02:02:55
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

02:02:55
JOHN I, I can see it. I, I know where it is. 

02:02:55
SUE JOHNSON And you can... 

02:02:55
JOHN I'm familiar with it now. 

02:03:00
SUE JOHNSON And you can feel it in your body. 

02:03:00
JOHN Yeah. And, and then what happens is nothing. I don't do-- really do anything because getting angry was like something I could do. Withdrawing was something I could do. But when the fears there, I, I guess... 

02:03:15
SUE JOHNSON You don't quite know what to do now. 

02:03:20
JOHN There's really nothing to-- that I need to do. Ah, ah, it just-- it's, it's got to be a way of letting it be more-- just be more I guess-- I don't know what happens, but, ah, to the tools that I used to use all of a sudden seem meaningless. 

02:03:30
SUE JOHNSON Well okay so, what you're telling me is, "Sue, I can actually feel that now and Gordon has actually helped me really get a felt sense of that. So it's not just an abstract I dare, right? Gordon is helping me. And now I can actually pause and not go off into snapping - 

02:03:50
JOHN Yeah. 

02:03:50
SUE JOHNSON - and defending myself or shutting down. I can actually pause and I can actually feel it underneath." All right. Thanks. Underneath... 

02:04:00
JOHN I, I think it's weird. I think it's weird. Ah, as soon as I do that, she probably-- maybe she senses it and, and can pick it up or something because my reaction is probably different. 

02:04:10
SUE JOHNSON Well, and when you feel that band around you, when you feel that feeling under your heart, in your stomach, right? 

02:04:15
JOHN Uh-hmm. 

02:04:15
SUE JOHNSON Uhm, is it so-- it's sort of tight, is it? It's kind of-- it's-- is it when you ate cuz there's a pain? Is it-- what does it feel like? 

02:04:25
JOHN It's, it's tight. It's a little bit like when you're hungry. When you're really hungry, the pain. But it's not a very pleasant one. 

02:04:30
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

02:04:30
JOHN It's more of like when you're in a horror movie and you get really scared. I, I don't know. You know, a flight or-- a fight or flight kind of thing. 

02:04:40
SUE JOHNSON You know that it's fear. You know that it-- it's sort of like a panic, is it? 

02:04:45
JOHN Yes, a panic. 

02:04:45
SUE JOHNSON It is a panic? 

02:04:45
JOHN Yeah. 

02:04:45
SUE JOHNSON Is that the best word for you? That's where it fits? 

02:04:50
JOHN Well maybe a subclinical panic, I'm gonna-- you know, a mini version of panic. It's got that - 

02:04:55
SUE JOHNSON It's California. 

02:04:55
JOHN - kind of fight or flight feeling to it like... 

02:04:55
SUE JOHNSON Yeah, it's saying... 

02:04:55
JOHN And it feels some adre-- adrenaline course and around down there. 

02:05:00
SUE JOHNSON It's, it's saying, "Stand up and fight or get the hell out of here. This is dangerous, dangerous, dangerous." 

02:05:00
JOHN Yeah. 

02:05:00
SUE JOHNSON And, and that, that panic has a voice and what does it say to you? Does it say to you some of the other things you've already-- what does it say to you? In the, in the, in the worst part of that panic when it's really happening, what does it say to you? 

02:05:20
SUE JOHNSON I'm trying to get the meaning and he doesn't come with me for the first break. 

02:05:25
[sil.] 

02:05:30
JOHN I don't know, it doesn't talk. I don't know what to think. 

02:05:35
SUE JOHNSON Or it does actually. Ah, because let me put it in other way. Maybe I'm not helping you now. Uhm, usually what happens is your body registers it and then there's an automatic set of we, we make sense of that feeling. And when we make sense to the feeling, there's thoughts. 

02:05:50
JOHN Well... 

02:05:50
SUE JOHNSON And the thoughts often sound to our regular everyday reality kind of simple and kind of bizarre, right? 

02:06:00
JOHN I see. 

02:06:00
SUE JOHNSON But they're not what-- if we think about what's happening inside us, so, uhm, you gave me one sort of-- at the beginning you said, well I hear that you know I say to myself she just doesn't care." Well I say to myself she could leave anytime. We talked about-- is that what comes up for? 

02:06:20
JOHN Yeah. I, I, I guess I think about loneliness. 

02:06:25
SUE JOHNSON Do you? 

02:06:25
JOHN And I think about financial hardship and loneliness. 

02:06:30
SUE JOHNSON So the loneliness the voice says that's it, you're alone, or you're gonna be alone, that's it? 

02:06:35
JOHN Sooner or later I'm gonna be alone and really depressed and sad and there won't be... 

02:06:40
SUE JOHNSON I'm gonna lose her, I'm gonna be sad, right? 

02:06:40
JOHN And, and I'll lose everything I've worked hard for and my life will really suck. 

02:06:50
SUE JOHNSON Sooner or later, so I'm go-- so this is it? This is almost like what I always knew would happen, I'm gonna be alone, she's gonna be just like my mom, she's suddenly gonna disappear on me, I'm gonna be alone, I'm gonna lose her, right? This is gonna be awful, right? 

02:07:10
JOHN Yes. 

02:07:10
SUE JOHNSON There's not gonna be any way out of this. 

02:07:10
JOHN Yeah. 

02:07:15
SUE JOHNSON All right. That's kind of like... 

02:07:15
JOHN And I've had some lonely parts of my life. I've had so much time. I'd go through one divorce already. So you know that's a feeling I don't wanna go through again. 

02:07:25
SUE JOHNSON Is that right? 

02:07:25
JOHN Yeah. And even before I was married I'd spent-- I had a lot of years of loneliness. I didn't really date much as a young man. 

02:07:35
SUE JOHNSON You know that lonely, lonely place? 

02:07:35
JOHN Yeah. 

02:07:35
SUE JOHNSON You know how really painful that is to feel that there's no one there for you and no one cares. You know that place? 

02:07:45
JOHN I had, I had a tough adolescence, you know. 

02:07:45
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

02:07:45
JOHN A lot of trouble with girls, very bad socially, very insecure. 

02:07:50
SUE JOHNSON And you, and... 

02:07:50
JOHN You know, I had a terrible teenage... 

02:07:50
SUE JOHNSON And somehow when you talk about your mom, you know, what you did was this, all right. And somehow that really hit me when you did that cuz it's almost like-- uhm, what I get is that she just shut down and shut you out and there was like nothing you could do. 

02:08:10
JOHN Yeah. 

02:08:10
SUE JOHNSON Suddenly, you are all by yourself, right? There was no safe place for you. 

02:08:15
JOHN Yeah. Then my dad became an alcoholic about three years after that. And, and he was worthless, worthless. 

02:08:20
SUE JOHNSON So you all alone... 

02:08:20
JOHN By the time of adolescence, I was really alone and nobody to help me do really much of anything else. I'm a little-- I became a good cook. 

02:08:30
SUE JOHNSON So-- all right, so you coped, right? But some part of you says, "Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Here it comes again. Here it comes this dreadful, dreadful feeling." 

02:08:40
JOHN Yes. Yeah. 

02:08:40
SUE JOHNSON And the person I love can-- could just suddenly turn into somebody totally different. Tur-- I just-- I'll lose her, right? She will be... 

02:08:50
JOHN Yeah. You know, I've got a very lonely existence as it is. I don't have a lot of friends. 

02:08:55
SUE JOHNSON Is that right? 

02:08:55
JOHN Ah, my one sister is in the nursing home with Ynes(ph). 

02:09:00
SUE JOHNSON Uh-hmm. 

02:09:00
JOHN My mom is 80 and she's starting to be old. She's actually better now than she was. I mean, she's slowly came out of that whole thing over the years. Uhm, and she lives right nearest now which is sweet but she's getting really old. So I mean, so if I lost my wife, I'd be back to ground zero. I really have very little family around. 

02:09:20
SUE JOHNSON Ground zero. 

02:09:20
SUE JOHNSON Ground zero? 

02:09:20
JOHN Kind of. I'd be pretty lonely. And I, I tend to be just, you know, a one person relationship kind of guy, you know. 

02:09:35
SUE JOHNSON And that's something that's kind of always on the edge of your world for you that this could suddenly happen. 

02:09:40
JOHN Yeah. 

02:09:40
SUE JOHNSON This is like a catastrophe. Ground zero is what you know as I associate as sort of images of bombs and, right, that's-- it's a catastrophe. It's just waiting to happen. And when you get this feeling in your stomach, that's where you go. You say here comes all this loneliness like a huge wave taking me all over. 

02:10:00
JOHN Yeah. 

02:10:00
SUE JOHNSON That's very scary. 

02:10:00
JOHN Yeah. 

02:10:00
SUE JOHNSON That's terrifying, right? 

02:10:00
JOHN Yeah. 

02:10:05
SUE JOHNSON Can you feel that some of that right now as we're talking about it? 

02:10:05
JOHN Oh, yeah, I feel it the whole time. Yeah. 

02:10:10
SUE JOHNSON Have you? 

02:10:10
JOHN Yeah, yeah, right in here and here. 

02:10:10
SUE JOHNSON That's a very, very hard feeling, yeah. 

02:10:15
JOHN Yeah. 

02:10:15
SUE JOHNSON Do you feel like Julie(ph) understands some, some of that... 

02:10:20
JOHN I mean I still have the fear. The fear is underneath there because, I mean, you know, anything could happen whether, whether it's-- obviously there's none. What if she get an accident in a day and like, maybe I don't have a good support. So I guess I'm carrying that all the time. 

02:10:30
SUE JOHNSON You're really, really aware of how much you need this lady. You're really, really aware of how much you depend on her. 

02:10:40
JOHN Yeah. 

02:10:40
SUE JOHNSON How she's your anklet in life. And you say to yourself even when you're not in this, in this pattern you say to yourself, you remind yourself, your mind naturally goes there too, "Oh my goodness anything could happen. Oh my goodness." Yeah? 

02:10:55
JOHN She goes in a long drive, you know. 

02:11:00
SUE JOHNSON Is that right? 

02:11:00
JOHN Yeah. True. 

02:11:00
SUE JOHNSON You get really, really scared when she... 

02:11:05
JOHN Well I'm not really scared but you know, like you said, I-- because my mind, daily, weekly, or whatever. 

02:11:10
SUE JOHNSON Uh-hmm. So have you ever just sat down and talk to Julie(ph) about what that fear feels like and how you struggle with that not just in this but on-- in these moments when you get stuck in this dance but, ah, you're always struggling with this sort of dark shadow of maybe losing Julia, maybe her not being there for you, and how alone you would be, and how much you count on her, have you ever really talk to her about that? 

02:11:40
JOHN No. Cuz I never really figure that out. 

02:11:45
SUE JOHNSON Well try to talk about it. 

02:11:50
JOHN I don't know, it's just so good. This is great. 

02:11:55
SUE JOHNSON That's an exit. 

02:11:55
JOHN I don't know. I, I, I, I guess I didn't really realize that. That's, that's something... 

02:12:00
SUE JOHNSON I know it's hard to feel and it's hard to talk about... 

02:12:00
JOHN Oh, you don't wanna-- I don't wanna feel it. I don't know, most of time, it is like-- it's just too much to think about. 

02:12:05
SUE JOHNSON I don't wanna feel it. 

02:12:05
JOHN Like there's better things to do. 

02:12:05
SUE JOHNSON The emotion itself become subversive. 

02:12:10
JOHN This strike myself for fun. Like the fun is in, in, in a escape. 

02:12:15
SUE JOHNSON So can, can you help Julie(ph) right now, John(ph)? Do you think you could turn to her right now and help her understand a little bit about huge fear that you struggle with? And what I'm hearing is it just peaks in this dreadful moments when you get caught in the dance. But actually it's kind of waiting in the shadows all the time for you. 

02:12:50
JOHN Yeah, yeah. 

02:12:50
SUE JOHNSON Right? So, yes. It's sitting there. 

02:12:50
JOHN It's something that's-- it's not-- I don't feel safe talking to her about because it's... 

02:12:55
SUE JOHNSON So he exits into shame. 

02:12:55
JOHN It feels like a witness. I think the boy code is we can't even talk about it. 

02:13:00
SUE JOHNSON I'm gonna entertain it and then go back. 

02:13:00
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

02:13:05
JOHN Ah, it, it does. I don't-- I can't feel embarrassed. 

02:13:10
SUE JOHNSON Yeah, I hear you. 

02:13:10
JOHN But I'll do it. 

02:13:10
SUE JOHNSON Well hang on a minute. I want you to slow down from here. 

02:13:15
JOHN Okay, okay. 

02:13:20
SUE JOHNSON Let's just get rid of that one. All right. Uhm, you're right, there is a boy code but actually women feel that way too and you have the right to that feeling cuz we've systematically talk people that they shouldn't have the desirable feelings, isn't it? Right. So but that's just the silliness, isn't it? Cuz we all have those vulnerable feelings. 

02:13:40
JOHN Yeah. 

02:13:45
SUE JOHNSON I have them, right? 

02:13:45
SUE JOHNSON Follow dates. 

02:13:45
SUE JOHNSON Gordon has them. All that people out there in that room watching us have them. We all have them. They're wide in to our brains. Our choice is what to do with them, right? But I understand you and I agree with you - 

02:14:00
JOHN Uh-hmm. 

02:14:05
SUE JOHNSON - that because of what I just said it often makes us very uncomfortable to talk about them. And it's hard to talk about them. So maybe what you're telling your lady is you know I do live with this fear all the time and it's so hard for me to even imagine, it's been hard for me to put it together and it's so hard for me to even imagine telling you cuz somehow I feel like I shouldn't even feel this way. 

02:14:30
JOHN Yeah, yeah. 

02:14:30
SUE JOHNSON Can you tell her that? 

02:14:35
JOHN Yeah. I don't, I don't want you think I'm a wimp. 

02:14:35
JULIE Uh-hmm. I don't. 

02:14:35
JOHN But, but, uhm, you know... 

02:14:40
JULIE Girls like this kind of vulnerability. I don't judge you at all since I'm not a boy. You don't have to worry about the boy... 

02:14:45
JOHN Well it's, it's hard for me to believe that. I, I... 

02:14:45
JULIE I believe it. 

02:14:45
JOHN I mean, it sounds nice. I appreciate you saying that. 

02:14:50
JULIE I'm not a boy, you know what I mean. 

02:14:50
JOHN I know. But, you know, I, I-- it's hard for me to believe that but you know, I, uhm... 

02:14:55
SUE JOHNSON It's-- you're telling her... 

02:14:55
JOHN You're like my whole support organ and... 

02:15:00
SUE JOHNSON You're telling her it's really hard for me to even imagine telling you about this fear. 

02:15:05
JOHN Yeah. 

02:15:05
SUE JOHNSON Then he can't get a help with it. He stopped with it. He's alone with it. 

02:15:10
SUE JOHNSON I'm so scared that you'll see-- you'll somehow decide that there's something wrong with me, that I have this fears that I have. 

02:15:10
JOHN Yeah, yeah, exactly. 

02:15:15
JULIE Well I just-- ho-- honestly, I just feel a lot more compassionate cuz I, I never-- that's not my paradigm. You know, I have-- I'm one of eight children so I can't even imagine what it would be like to feel so vulnerable and alone. I just can't cognitively imagine it cuz I'm in the middle of all these kids and so there's always people around me all the time. But hearing how you-- what you're saying, just-- it just touches my heart and makes me wanted just like care for you more. 

02:15:40
JOHN Because you know. 

02:15:45
SUE JOHNSON Can you hear him? 

02:15:45
JOHN Who's my bestfriend and companion. 

02:15:45
JULIE I know. Well I'm your bestfriend. 

02:15:45
SUE JOHNSON Hang on, hang on with it. Just try to slow down. Can you hear? Did you hear what she say? 

02:15:50
JOHN Yeah, yeah. 

02:15:55
SUE JOHNSON Okay. I wanna know what happens to you. You just took a huge risk here. You, you know, you put your fear together into a ball, talked about it, owned it, said it's scary to even think about, talking about this to my partner. You told her scary and she responded to you by telling you it makes me feel soft towards you, compassionate, caring. I wanna know why Julie(ph) says that. Can you take that in? 

02:16:25
JOHN A little bit. 

02:16:30
SUE JOHNSON A little bit. 

02:16:30
JOHN A little bit. But - 

02:16:30
JULIE But... 

02:16:30
SUE JOHNSON - there's still a part of me that says, you know, I have lot of experiences with the girls and seeing all the guys grown up with women that-- women like the tough guys, they like this bad boys, they like the guy sort of strong, and I sort of can't 100% believe that, you know, but I appreciate you saying that. 

02:16:55
JULIE I mean... 

02:16:55
JOHN But I'm a little-- just a little nervous. That's all. 

02:16:55
SUE JOHNSON Okay. It helps you saying, it helps a little bit, but what I've always believed is that women want this big strong dudes, yeah. 

02:17:00
JOHN Yeah. 

02:17:05
SUE JOHNSON Uh-hmm. Except the big strong dudes are big phonies. 

02:17:10
SUE JOHNSON Therapist tends to be impatient. 

02:17:10
JOHN Well, they want a big phonies even. It's all take to be strong. 

02:17:10
SUE JOHNSON Do they? 

02:17:10
JULIE I mean, doesn't it take... 

02:17:10
JOHN I don't know. 

02:17:10
JULIE Don't, don't you think it takes strength to be able to admit these things? I mean, like a, a real phony character... 

02:17:20
JOHN I, I know intellectually, intellectually. Yeah, of course. 

02:17:20
JULIE Okay. Well, I'm not gonna be able to convince you. 

02:17:20
JOHN Ah, yeah. 

02:17:20
JULIE But I'm just sharing. 

02:17:25
JOHN Okay. But it, it helps. It really helps to, to just crack... 

02:17:25
SUE JOHNSON That you-- when you-- that when he - 

02:17:25
JULIE Yeah. 

02:17:25
SUE JOHNSON When he takes this kind of risk with you, you appreciate it? 

02:17:30
JULIE Yeah, and that's-- I love him. 

02:17:30
SUE JOHNSON And you feel really, and you feel really good about him reaching out and trusting you with that, with that soft upon himself? 

02:17:40
JULIE Yeah. 

02:17:40
SUE JOHNSON And you respond to that, right? 

02:17:40
JULIE Yeah. 

02:17:40
SUE JOHNSON Has you feeling closer to him? 

02:17:45
JULIE Yeah. I admire you. I'm like impressed that you would be able to like talk, feel that, and then ex-- express it. I mean, I just have to share the truth and like I find that admirable. I, I find that strong. I'm, I'm not just saying because I think that's what I'm supposed to be saying right now. 

02:18:00
JOHN Yeah. 

02:18:00
JULIE I really think that's strong, and I like it. 

02:18:05
JOHN This is helping. This is helping. 

02:18:05
JULIE And it makes me feel-- because all I've ever wanted is, is-- the thing that matters to me most of all more than money or the ways to my looks or anything is am I gonna be able to have a, a strong, deep emotional connection with, ah, you. And to me when I hear you say these things, I'm like good. That's on the level of, of deep emotional connection so I've just-- you know what I mean? Like, I like... 

02:18:30
SUE JOHNSON You feel, you, you feel like he's let you in? 

02:18:30
JULIE Yeah. 

02:18:30
SUE JOHNSON And that's really what you want him to do and you've been longing for him to do is to let you in. You feel like he's really let you in when he does that, yeah? 

02:18:40
JULIE Yeah. And it just makes me wanna like hold him closer to me and just say like, you know, thank you for expressing that and I, I would never crush you. You know what I mean? I would wanna care for you especially after you shared these things. You know, it's the opposite of what you would think. Instead of just spurning you of telling me that, it just makes me wanna hold you closer. 

02:19:00
SUE JOHNSON Can you hear it? 

02:19:05
JOHN Yeah. 

02:19:05
SUE JOHNSON Can you let that in? Yeah? Can you let that in, John(ph)? 

02:19:05
JOHN Yeah. 

02:19:10
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. Yeah. That helps? Hmm? All right. Cuz she feels like you let her in then, right? And maybe what she's been longing for with time is, it's just that, it's you. Not some big strong dude. 

02:19:35
JULIE He looks strong. He's probably an arrogant or something. 

02:19:35
JOHN Well, I can still fake being strong. 

02:19:40
JULIE I don't even like guys like that so you don't have to worry. They seem like they'd be jerks to me. 

02:19:50
JOHN So let's... 

02:19:50
SUE JOHNSON But you're starting to do something incredibly strong here, something into this all kinds of strength that lots and lots of people struggle their whole lives and never do. You're starting to be able to rather than flip into anger or shut down and move away in that amount. You're starting to be able to stand up in the middle of all that and in all that those flood waters and stand up and find yourself and say, "You know, uhm, what I'm feeling is panic. What I'm feeling is lonely and scared. And this is pretty overwhelming. And you know, it's pretty hard, Julie(ph), to actually even tell you this cuz I'm so scared, you'll see me as weak. But here I am, I'm opening the door and I'm starting to tell you. about it," yeah? That takes a huge amount of strength, hmm? I think so. 

02:20:50
JOHN Yeah, I think. 

02:20:55
SUE JOHNSON Can you tell her a little bit about what that panic feels like? That loneliness feels like? Can you tour a little bit about it? 

02:21:00
SUE JOHNSON I go back to the task with the sharing of fear. Just for a minute. 

02:21:05
JOHN It's pretty bad. It's, it's like when you wake up in the morning. I mean, this, this-- I, I just have to just too rough skin in my adolescence. 

02:21:15
SUE JOHNSON Uh-hmm. 

02:21:20
JOHN Most of adolescence, it's like when you wake up and the sun is not shining everyday. It's probably just like depression for me, you know. You know, that wherever you go there's just people busy with the other things. You know, I had a few friends that has bright points but you know, you-- I come home and there's this people around you that's, that's you're on your own. I don't know. It's hard to describe. It's really hard to describe. 

02:21:45
SUE JOHNSON It's always waiting for you. That's what I'm hearing. 

02:21:50
JOHN What do you mean? 

02:21:50
SUE JOHNSON It's almost it's like you're always checking out if this awful feeling of loneliness is gonna take you over again, right? It's a sort of present danger in your world.

JOHN Okay. So I was talking about just what it-- what the loneliness is like and what was like in the past. What I'm, I'm projecting it might be like if you left. You know, come home, house is dark. Nobody is there. Phone doesn't ring. If I was to go out anywhere, you know, people be all busy with themselves. Just being-- you know, that's like how my life would be. 

02:22:25
SUE JOHNSON Uh-hmm. The house would be dark. Yeah. The house would be dark. 

02:22:30
JOHN Yeah, yeah, and silent and... 

02:22:30
SUE JOHNSON Dark and silent, yeah. 

02:22:30
JOHN You know. 

02:22:35
SUE JOHNSON And that's this dreadful fear that comes up in you, yeah? That has you are the flipping into rage or just snapping or shutting down. It's, it's this fear that the house would be silent because you really count on this lady, this is-- she's your lifeline here, yeah? 

02:22:50
JOHN Yeah. 

02:22:55
SUE JOHNSON And without her, you... 

02:22:55
JOHN It's, it's painful. For some reason, that's painful. All right. I could keep in me why, why that hurts but it hurts. 

02:23:05
SUE JOHNSON Oh yeah. I mean, you know, what you've just described is dark and silent and alone. Listening, you know, that's, that's scary for everyone. Yeah? Yeah? We're all terrified of that, yeah? 

02:23:25
JOHN Yeah. 

02:23:25
SUE JOHNSON Yeah? 

02:23:25
JOHN Okay. 

02:23:30
SUE JOHNSON Can you hear him? 

02:23:30
JULIE Uh-hmm. Yeah. 

02:23:35
SUE JOHNSON All right. But now... 

02:23:35
JOHN I wouldn't even know who to call. Ah, ah, I don't know who to call. I don't have Melissa or Sydney or, you know... 

02:23:45
JULIE Yeah, you know, I understand. 

02:23:45
JOHN She's not always she had like seven siblings but she's... 

02:23:45
SUE JOHNSON You're saying, you're saying to her I depend on you so much. 

02:23:50
JOHN Ah, you know, I feel really like I got myself to a pad situation of what we think about. I'd better join the group or something and get some friends, you know. 

02:24:00
SUE JOHNSON Well, you know... 

02:24:00
JOHN It's a lot of burden for her, isn't it? 

02:24:00
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. But-- and that's one way to think about it. And you know, maybe it is good to have some friends and reach out to other people. But I think right here and right now what you're saying to this lady is, listen, you know, I become aware in these moments of how much I depend on you and how some part of me goes into this place where the world would be totally dark and silent without you and that loneliness gets really, really scary and it's just on the edge waiting to take me over all the time. And that makes when you turn and say-- when we have a fight and you turn on and say, ah, "Oh, I think, ah, I could leave you," or when you turn and say, "I suddenly feel disconnected from you," you turn and say, "Well I'm off to see all my friends and suddenly I feel disconnected." That's when all these feelings come up and I get stuck, you know, you had to deal with them, yeah? But you are dealing with them differently right here, right now in this room for someone you never met before. 

02:25:05
More Secure Partners Can: 1. Retain emotional balance. Less flooded with anxiety or anger when disconnected / threatened. Less reactive / defensive. 2. Tune into emotions and formulate coherent direct messages re needs. 3. Remain flexible and open, tuning response to context and reflecting on experience / interaction. (Meta-perspectives). 4. Trustingly take in comfort and care - returning to physiological homeostasis. 5. Deal with ambiguous responses with less catastrophising / numbing. 

02:25:10
SUE JOHNSON Okay. That's, uhm, one of my favorite pieces of tape. Uhm, so what-- let's just-- I'm gonna finish up, but let me just tell you what I was doing there. Just in case, so that everybody knows what I was doing there. Hang on. Speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding because we didn't really get time to talk about the second stage of EFT or what secure partners can do. But I'm gonna tell you, what I'm doing there is I'm taking-- I'm getting them to take, engage in their emotions differently and to take tiny, tiny needle steps. This stage, one of EFT, but we'll do it even more in stage two which is called the first stage called the escalation of the negative cycle that creates distance. The second stage is called restructuring the bond. And we'll up the anti to get him to do this more and get hurt to respond and get hurt to do it as well. What I'm doing is getting them to take tiny little steps to deeper levels of engagement where they can share their attachment fears in a way that the other person can help them with those fears and they can ask for their attachment needs to be met in a way that holds their partner close. That's what we call hold me tight conversations. Those are the co-- conversations that really create a secure emotional bond or renew a secure emotional bond. Those conversations seem to be sufficient to create what we would call significant lasting change in couples therapy. And of course what they also do which I don't have time to talk to you about is if you can create secure attachment in partners you open the door to all kinds of amazing changes because all the research says that securely attached partners are more resilient. They're more able to deal with stress. They feel better about themselves. They have better self-concept. They are able to assert themselves more. They are more able to go out into the world and learn and engage and explore. Secure attachment is the door into a better emotional, ah, mental and physical health. So then you're creating a huge amount of change. You're creating a real place where partners can grow as in individuals because they have each other's back.

here is the deepest secret nobody knows (here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which grows higher than soul can hope or mind can hide) and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart i carry your heart (i carry it in my heart) -e.e. cummings 

02:27:35
SUE JOHNSON So rather than ending on that kind of note, I'm gonna need with a poem because here's what we're trying to create in couple therapy. Here is the deepest secret that nobody knows. Here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life which grows higher than soul can hope or mind can hide. And this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart. I carry your heart. I carry it in my heart. We know what is necessary and sufficient to help couples build strong and lasting bonds. Thank you.
