When it comes to eating, most of the kids in my school I do not think that we eat right. I mean for lunch, most of us have like fries and that's it and it's just an unhealthy life style. 

00:00:25
STUART MUSZYNSKI 80% of teens eat junk food every week. Are we supersizing our kids? Join us in principles. 

00:00:30
PROJECT LOVE PRESENTS PRINCIPLES Obesity Are We Supersizing Our Kids? THE MT. SINAI HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital University Hospitals of Cleveland THE HERSHEY FOUNDATION CONSOLIDATED GRAPHICS GROUP INC 

00:00:35
Today's episode of principles was made possible by a grant from the The Mt. Sinai Health Care Foundation with additional support from University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, The Hershey Foundation, and Consolidated Graphics Group. 

00:00:55
STUART MUSZYNSKI Welcome to Principles. I'm Stuart Muszynski and I'm joined today by my co-host Roger Sidoti , by Dr. Rena LaZebnik, by Cheryl Goggans from the Girl Scouts, by today's teens and by George Alderdice. George has struggled his entire life with obesity and he lost 500 pounds. 

00:01:15
In 2001, George Alderdice hit rock bottom. 

00:01:15
GEORGE ALDERDICE I just sat my apartment, stared at wall, didn't shower and brushed my teeth. 

00:01:20
He knew he was overweight. 

00:01:20
THE ROCK PILE 

00:01:25
GEORGE ALDERDICE Headed down to the Rock Pile in Avon ah... because early on one said, (inaudible ) you'll get on a truck scale to weigh myself.

00:01:30
677 pounds and $42,000 in debt, he took his leftover change and join the Westlake Weigh, his first day. 

00:01:40
GEORGE ALDERDICE I'd walked three laps around the track and swam two laps in the pool. 

00:01:45
Seven months and a 100 pounds later, the weigh hired him. 

00:01:45
GEORGE ALDERDICE I'm not gonna get paid to walk. 

00:01:50
Convenient for his daily workouts in the pool and gym. 

00:01:50
GEORGE ALDERDICE I was having competition with myself and the competition with people, other people who said I couldn't do it, because a lot of people had given up. 

00:02:00
George's efforts prove a new study that says aerobic exercise cannot only improve cardiovascular risk but also reduce levels of depression. He may have shaped his body and his mind. 

00:02:15
He is an inspiration and often gives advice. 

00:02:15
GEORGE ALDERDICE Just walking through the door is like a battle. 

00:02:15
He dropped 450 pounds in under three years, one step at a time. 

00:02:20
GEORGE ALDERDICE Just get up, because you wanna know something when you're 500 pounds walking (inaudible ) is... is an accomplishment. 

00:02:30
George Alderdice 

00:02:30
STUART MUSZYNSKI George I just wanna turn to you. I know you have a saying that you don't have to win every day, but you have to win every week. Can you tell us a little bit about your struggle and how you accomplished what you did? 

00:02:45
GEORGE ALDERDICE Well, the saying is because you’re not gonna be perfect. Nobody is gonna be perfect a 100% at a time. So that's basically where it came from that when people trying to be perfect every single day that's when you fall off the wagon so to speak. And the struggle came, you know, I was always quote the husky, husky kid coming growing up in the school, but I had a little bit easier, because I was also the athlete. So I didn't get picked on or anybody bother me all that much because you know they're gonna to pick on the guy who has two sacks or scores 20 points or hits two homeruns. My biggest problem is when I... most likely went to... went to college because I was playing three or four sports and then all of a sudden I wanted doing nothing. So... but the struggle it was... always was through high school because why are my friends eating all this and I eat half of what they are, but I'm still twice the size as they are and that type of stuff. So basically more... more or less it... it has been a (inaudible ) struggle now, but the philosophy is you have to try every day. You can't always put it off to I'll start tomorrow, I'll start tomorrow, I'll start tomorrow and so many people have the problem if it's Wednesday or Thursday, I'll start next week (inaudible ) and I hear that all the time at the weigh. Ah... Well I'm gonna... I'm gonna come in here and take my steam and my executive, which is (inaudible ) they go home. But you have to... you have to try everyday and sometimes you're not gonna to be perfect, but if you can win every week and not even win every week but just stay at (inaudible ) every week, you're going to be alright. 

00:04:16
STUART MUSZYNSKI HOST Founder of Project Love Well, I think that there are really two issues that you're talking about. One you're talking about the obesity issue and many Americans struggle with that every day just as you did. And number two, you're talking about the exercise issue. I know that ah... that Gallopo recently reported that... that only one in four teenagers exercise on a regular basis. What would you recommend to the teens surround this panel today? 

00:04:40

00:04:45
Well, exercise is important and there are different kinds of exercises, getting up and taking the dog for a walk. That's an exercise. Even if you wanna do that at night, just get away from your parents, hey, I'm taking the dog out. Ah... My... my really just true recommendation would be, you know, get off from behind the computer screen, get off from the TV and go out and do some because when I was younger, we saw if you drove down the street, everybody... everybody's front yards were full of kids, playing baseball, playing football, doing this and you drive down the street now, you very rarely see that many kids aren't in the yards and because they're all behind the computer screens and playing the video games. Now it's still alright to do that but limited to one-hour a day. Okay, I'm gonna go home, I'm gonna e-mail or whatever they do on their computers to their friends and that type of stuff and then you're gonna go out. 

00:05:35
STUART MUSZYNSKI Do you guys exercise on a regular basis and... and what do you see going on in your high schools? 

00:05:40
A lot of kids in my school I see that they do and you see 'em up at the gym, everyone's (inaudible ). You know they go up there a lot and I... I might not go up there every day, but I get my fresh air working out. 

00:05:50
I work out three times a week at the weight room and it's actually with a lot of my friends. We all go up there together and have a good time working out together and then I also soccer about two, three, four times a week. 

00:06:00
I think most of the teens think that walking around the school, walking up the downstairs everyday is like a exercise to them. 

00:06:10
STUART MUSZYNSKI And Roger what do you see in your school as a Principal? 

00:06:10
ROGER SIDOTI Co-host, High School Principal Well, I think I... I see the same type of issues. Ah... kids are very active the ones who are involved in athletics. Certainly they are very active, but I think you see a lot of kids who do try... try to take advantage of the... the thing the opportunities at school might be concerned as what they're doing outside a school. Ah... you know when they're in school, there are those... those opportunities that tracks there the... you know the weight rooms there and everything, but once they leave us and they're home, I'm not so sure how much exercise they are really getting. 

00:06:40
One of the complaints for many of the kids I see is that not every school actually offers gym or any kind of exercise doing there. 

00:06:50
ROGER SIDOTI Well, I think that every school has the facilities. 

00:06:50
Right. 

00:06:50
ROGER SIDOTI So we're... we're fortunate that our facilities are basically open to the public after schooling. So that... that allows, you know, students to continue to stay there if they wanna get involved and get on the track and... and of course that's when it's not being used by athletes. 

00:07:05
STUART MUSZYNSKI I wanna ask why are we so concerned if teens are staying active in school? Obviously they're doing a lot of walking, walking up the stairs, you know walking with heavy book bags, ah... walking around the school, in many cases walking to school. Why are we so overly concerned about 84% of teens eating junk food. I mean what's wrong with that? 

00:07:35
DR. RENA LAZEBNIK University Hospitals I'm personally, you know, seeing my patients, I... not all kids actually exercise. I have a lots of kids who come and ask, could you give me a medical note so I don't have to swim, could you give me a medical note so I... I have a bus and I don't have to walk and you know I really have (inaudible ) I don't want to do it. You know and... and it does take a lot of education to say, no this is actually very good for you and you really don't have a medical reason not to... not to do this. So not everybody's actually ah... putting in, you know, at least an hour of physical activity every day, a lot of kids don't, a lot of kids do, but a lot of kids don't. 

00:08:15
CHERYL GOGGANS Girl Scouts I guess I become concerned we look at exercise as something separate from breathing and eating and taking care of our bodies, I think that's a... that's a cultural piece that is a disconnect the way we're talking about, our body. 

00:08:25
GEORGE ALDERDICE I think it's a combination too. I think you are right on the money. It's a combination. George, I'm curious did you change your eating habits at all? 

00:08:35
GEORGE ALDERDICE Oh, I completely changed. I put the Ramen noodles down and picked up the Broccoli. Even though the Ramen noodles are ten for a dollar and Broccoli is 239 a pound or whatever it is, but you have to change your eating habits. And unfortunately, you know, we don't see people walking at the stores anymore but we become (inaudible ) our society too. In order to get to the store, you have to cross a four, five or six-lane road to get to that store. So that... you know that makes it a little bit harder and when I was growing up, get on your bike, ride to the... ride to the supermarket and pick up whatever you need, what mom wants and then you ride back home, but it's... it's become... they're so congestive, so much traffic everywhere. It's harder to get places, (inaudible ) or bike or that type of stuff, because you have to watch off for the semi(ph) coming down 45 miles an hour down the street too. 

00:09:20
STUART MUSZYNSKI It sounds to me as though what we're really talking about is developing the right habits and we wanna to take a look at a clip of what one teen he had to say about eating habits. 

00:09:30
It's kind of all around. The thing is people eat too much. It's more like a quantity than what you eat. I mean some people eat really bad and some people eat really healthy, but either way most people eat a lot. 

00:09:45
STUART MUSZYNSKI So how can we get our teens to develop the right habits because we know I... I think that part of the concern that we have as adults is everything in... in life is about developing habits. You know the habits you develop as a teenager, you're going to carry into your adult life just as you developed habits going back to middle school, right George? 

00:10:05
GEORGE ALDERDICE The habit that you should use, I mean, and I developed, you know, I... I put this into my, you know, use a smaller plate first of all that is a big thing because as... as Americans we want... you know we want everything supersized. If that plate's not full, then something is wrong. If you use a smaller plate, hey, I have a full plate in front of me, it's all about you know how much things are heaping over and it is... it's developing of the... of the habits and I develop some very bad habits you know in middle school, even elementary school. 

00:10:35
CHERYL GOGGANS So shouldn't we be talking about when we talk to these kids that are sitting here, um... how do you want to be supported in your eating habits? 

00:10:45
I think the biggest thing is kids need to realize that ah... they can eat whatever they want now and they might not gain as much weight because they have higher metabolism. But as they get older and they... if they (inaudible ) eating habits or they're going to gain a lot more weight and the food, because they are not going to be exercise how much they do when they are younger because you'll be playing a lot more. 

00:11:05
CHERYL GOGGANS And your body (inaudible ) down too. 

00:11:08
Yes. 

00:11:08
There are healthy choices in our school cafeteria when it comes to eating lunch. We have a salad bar every single day that you can make your own salads, use your toppings, and we also have a lunch line. And sometimes some of the things in the lunch line aren't that appealing. So people choose not to eat it, and then they go to the snack line which is... has the fries and like the mozzarella sticks and things that should be supplementing with the meal, but instead people substitute that for a meal. 

00:11:35
STUART MUSZYNSKI So we want to talk about how parents and schools can get involved. I know ah... I'll give you an example of... of parent involvement. I just found this out last week. My sister-in-law who lives down in Florida decided that her whole family is gonna go on a healthy diet and they eliminated junk food. She has a 10-year-old and a 14-year-old and the two of them and they... they... as a family made a commitment to eliminate junk food to eat healthy foods for her to cook healthy foods and everybody is reacting positively to this. The kids are saying that they have more energy, that they are happier. The parents are saying that they have more energy, that they are happier. Is this one approach that we can take and what other approaches can we take in terms of families getting on the same page together and schools assisting(inaudible )? 

00:12:28
I think it's important for parents health, the children (inaudible) healthier because like if you're... if I got a lot of time and you just went home. I... I might just grab some junk food or whatever available but if that kind of food was unavailable to me, I'd be forced to make a sandwich (inaudible ) healthier. So definitely parents need to just not keep the junk food in the house because they're the ones who go shopping. 

00:12:50
Well, like if you're five years old and your parents are going to be feeding you your vegetables, whether you like it or not, it's going to be a habit and you're going to grow up with that habit eating healthy. And then but if you don't have those habits growing up when you're a teenager, those habits are gonna be hard to break to start, if you wanna all... all the (inaudible ) eating healthy, it's just gonna be... it's gonna be hard to break and start something new. So I think it personally starts from when you're younger with the parents. 

00:13:10
To find out more about Project Love visit www.projectlove.org http://www.projectlove.org 

00:13:10
DR. RENA LAZEBNIK University Hospitals Probably we need to do that a lot of adult education so parents know what they need to do how they need to shop. A lot of adults don't have that basic knowledge and they really need to have it. And then it's much easier for them, then they have to buy into it of course but then it's a lot more easier for them to ah... reinforce it at home. And I just want to make a point in terms of what parents can do is ah... is really make available breakfast for the kids because I... I really find out that a lot of kids leave home and they really don't have anything to eat. Many of them say, well I grab breakfast at school, but they really get there, just when the bell rings and there is nothing until lunch and then they... they just grab the first thing that they... that they see and... and they eat. And you know we know that they will do a lot better in school if they have breakfast but it's a lot more healthier also to have breakfast. So you know this is one of my educational um... pieces when I see parents and kids. 

00:14:10
STUART MUSZYNSKI By the way my son must be the only teenager in America who eats chicken soup every morning for breakfast. 

00:14:20
CHERYL GOGGANS You know I was thinking about that other... what else can we do. What about peer support, we always talk about peer pressure in a negative way, but could peers help yoiu eat right? 

00:14:30
I... I definitely think peers and friends and people are in school really can help you because that was a big thing like when... when I started to get into the whole weight conscious and healthy diets. You know home, my parents were always there. You know they always kept the... the regular puffs away. It's always diet puffs if anything. Um... water was the huge thing. But like also friends like I... I drive, I go out with my friends, I go out to dinner with my friends and having my friends there to say, you know, no you don't wanna eat that like they know. It's like they're... they're very much a part of you know helping you continue that outside of your home. When you don't have your mom there, Tony, no, don't eat that here. They're there to tell you , you know, come on let's not eat that. That... this is the healthier choice. 

00:15:15
STUART MUSZYNSKI Well, I wanna ask once again turning to the role of schools, I wanna ask the teens again what is the role of Coke and Pepsi and other soft drinks, I mean they are abundant, there are... there are always machines in schools and you see Coke and Pepsi banners at your football games and of course Coke and Pepsi are alternatively giving lots of money for having that soft drink stationed in your school. So what do you see as the role of soft drinks? And is... is that a positive? Is that a negative? Does that prevent you from going after a healthy life style? 

00:16:00
Um... In my school, we actually (inaudible ) in school. But all the vending machines are filled with juice and like teas, but (inaudible ) wants a Pepsi machine. So they kinda like advertise, so outside of school you're still thinking of it, when it's available to you, you may want it opposed if you didn't have the vending machines with Pepsi all over it. 

00:16:20
ROGER SIDOTI Um... It's awful hard to turn down $50,000 over a 10-year period to have Coke machines and Pepsi machines and things like that. And I... and I think that that's the saddest part of this whole thing. I... I think that a lot of times we have a tendency to look at teens in a negative way and say it's their fault and truly I... I really think it’s what we model as adults ah... and I believe that we need to model appropriateness for... for our kids and we've gone on a... on a.. a campaign. We're slowly easing out the soft drinks out of our building and we're replacing with water machines and (inaudible ). But you know that cultural um... pressure to maintain those machines and some of those contracts that schools are involved in, they're pretty direct you know that you... if you wanna keep the money, you... you need to keep certain products. So I think you're exactly right. I think it’s what we model as adults and we need to change our habits. 

00:17:10
Bad eating habits probably started around middle-school years. Um... McDonald's and stuff I know (inaudible) video supersized me. (inaudible ) McDonald targets little younger children and just kids and once they start getting their license, people, they get... get to the fast food restaurants more easily. 

00:17:30
STUART MUSZYNSKI So when... when we look at the influence that the media and the fast food restaurants have on our culture, what can we do to counter that and is there a role that schools have? I mean I know that we're dumping a lot on our schools and teachers feel overworked and underpaid and that every social ills kind of dumped on them, but is there a role for schools and for educators to get involved in this? 

00:17:55
ROGER SIDOTI Schools don't have a choice anymore. The... in our state, every school building is going to have to have a school health committee and part of the charge is... is to help design um... programs and to create an atmosphere within schools where kids begin to understand what those healthy choices are and we're... we're empowered to do that. I'd be curious to know how the kids feel. Do you feel your schools are doing any of that right now? 

00:18:20
No. I... I think that um... like we have too many options where we can eat like at lunch time we just leave and you go down a street to McDonald, Burger King, Mr. Heroes, it's everything like we have a broadway diner. It's just too many options I think. 

00:18:35
STUART MUSZYNSKI But if... if you really wanted to and you wanted to go into a McDonald's or Burger King and get a salad, you could, right? 

00:18:45
But it's all about advertising too like you don't see a salad ah... in front of McDonald's or nothing like that. It's fries and cheese burgers and stuff like that. 

00:18:55
(inaudible ) that the salads even have like a lot of fat and stuff and because like they have the chicken strips and like they say that that even has a lot of fat in it too, there salads too. 

00:19:05
ROGER SIDOTI So obviously your kids are somewhat educated. You hear what they are saying. I mean they... they understand I think that... that you know the idea of too much fat and too much sugar. But the question is... is that how do we get them into practicing those... that you know the knowledge that they have? 

00:19:20
To order a videotape of 1-866-517-1211 

00:19:20
STUART MUSZYNSKI Well, I think a lot of it is impulse. You know I mean frankly it... it... it doesn't excite me that much talking about a juicy salary stick. As... as much as if you know somebody we're talking about a juicy cheese burger, you know you could kind of visualize that, can't you? And I think that that's part of the issue that we have in our society and you know that yeah, that is promoted. You get those images from the advertising. You know it kind of creeps into what you do as a lifestyle choice. 

00:19:45
DR. RENA LAZEBNIK I... I think it's really though a... a matter... also a matter of how much, because there are clearly a lot of young people who can eat everything. They just have to... have to eat the right portions. And I think um... you know a lot of you know what is actually demonstrated in this movie is if you know you supersize everything and I think that's a culture I think that we kind of like a very large portions as you mentioned before the plates are big, the portions are big and we expect for our money a lot and we forget a little bit, we're very disappointed and I think that's what you know the fast food industry you know has... probably has done a lot of damage because they're giving a lot of food for very limited amount of money and they would give you just one burger with one piece of meat on it, it wouldn't be so bad or if you just eat the salad and then put a lot of the dressing on it, it would be a perfect meal, but if you add to it so much and you know um... then it really becomes a lot more than the body actually needs. And I think that part of the education you know has to come from home, has to come from school, has to come from the media, has to kind of come from ah... a lot of different angles. 

00:21:00
STUART MUSZYNSKI Well I... I just want to follow up on... on your point and... and ask you about some of the health aspects. I know for example the movie supersized me, which Paul referenced ah... in his clip there the individual who would constantly be eating supersized meals, his cholesterol went out of whack, his heart rate went out of whack, just his... some of his body systems were shutting down. So what are the risk factors that we wanna educate our teens about? 

00:21:30
DR. RENA LAZEBNIK Well, and I think we need to talk about you know long-term consequences of what unhealthy eating habits will actually cause, which in a way talking to teens is very hard because teenagers in themselves you know they are not looking to the future. They really live in the... live in the present, so it's really more the adults that need to get that education and kind of model it at home so they'll learn. But overall it's you know, the increasing rates of ah... high blood pressure that we see in teenagers. We see a lot more ah... tendency for diabetes. And diabetes per se we see sleep problems with kids. We see sleep (inaudible ) problems with kids. So there is a whole array of real medical problems that we start seeing in teenagers and definitely a lot more in young adults. 

00:22:20
STUART MUSZYNSKI Someone, one of the teens on the panel mentioned that parents can do the... the greatest thing parents can do is to provide dinner for their kids. A consistent dinner, which unfortunately most families don't do. But if... if the teens could just review with us a little bit what your schedules are like? And how your... how fast you're moving and how that fits into going to McDonald's and grabbing hamburger because you're going off to a sports vendor or this to that? And you know we know as... as adults that fits into our schedules kinda conveniently as well. So teens, how do you feel about that? 

00:23:00
I dinner probably four... five... four or five times a week with my parents like every night. My parents make us have like a vegetable and a fruit that we have to eat it at dinner, but it depends on like when they get home from work or if they have something to do and sometimes we lay or like if we're out, then we go and grab something. So sometimes four time... four or five times a week we eat with them, I'd like to table with them. 

00:23:20
(inaudible ) our families are a lot different because we as a family maybe one, two times a week. I have two younger brothers who are all involved in sports and stuff and when we get into like a dinner with the family, it's like a good time. You know like we all enjoy, but it's really hard to do, because I'm either at soccer, at work. I soccer and work like two, three times a week alternating days, working out at school. I mean usually when I go to school, I don't come home to around 10 o' clock because I'm always going from the next thing to next thing. 

00:23:50
DR. RENA LAZEBNIK And there are a lot of stressors ah... on these kids to succeed, to do well, to do this and that as they are adults you know to go to work to come home and run the family and... and I think with the kids who run into problem actually really eat very poorly and you know gain the weight. 

00:24:05
STUART MUSZYNSKI I think we want to turn to our audience at this point and get some audience reactions. So we're going to do that now. 

00:24:15
Hi. I believe this (inaudible ) system should start a new plan or something. They should have more salads instead of more burgers and fries. 

00:24:20
ROGER SIDOTI I think you need to have a range of food available. I think kids need to learn what... what's healthy to eat and we need to try to reduce the amount of unhealthy food, but I want to go back and say that a good burger is not necessarily unhealthy. If you eat a... if you eat a burger and fries everyday or mass potatoes and gravy every day, if you... that's what's unhealthy. And so you know we have to figure out we are helping our kids to make those good decisions about what's available for 'em and then take advantage of it. 

00:24:50
GEORGE ALDERDICE Because we had a salad bar when I was in high school and (inaudible ) $50. They said you know a plate of food, well my friend and I used the tray as the plate and we would have this huge salad mounted up with turkey, bake and everything. So you know it was a salad and this.. and the true def... but the definition really it was not a salad. It had five pounds (inaudible ) dressing, it had everything. So it's... bottom line is education. Well, I'm gonna have a salad and I'm gonna have a little bit of those and move to that and you can make a salad and do a huge five course meal if you wanted to. 

00:25:20
Well, I wanna thank everybody and wanna thank everyone for watching. 

00:25:30
Teens [inaudible] busy than ever. Let's be prepared to make good decisions on how we eat and make time for exercise. Thanks for watching.
