Reid Wilson, Ph.D. 

00:00:15
REID WILSON Good morning y'all. 

00:00:15
UNKNOWN Good morning. 

00:00:20
REID WILSON I'm from the South. Uh… This I'm gonna be a little formal this morning because we have some very special guests that are watching us live on a webinar so "Hello, to you." I have no idea who they are, but if I call them very special, they'll like me and that's important to me, so trust issues. So we're gonna talk about anxiety. My objective is to give us two hours a protocol that can be applied to all the anxiety disorders. So panic disorder, social anxiety, specific phobias, generalized anxiety disorder and OCD, that I named them all. And I even added OCD backend. So umm… that's our objective and let's see how we do. I'm gonna show you some little video uh… working with two different women. There'll be short little clips uh… to illustrate some of these things because I think it's the best way to deliver that to you. So hang on and we'll get going. Is that all right with you, even if it's not we're gonna get going. Uh… If you need to write me there's the second slide of your handout that is on you can download at the conference website, it has my information there and such I wanna acknowledge the (inaudible) Foundation for allowing me to show this first set of clips for with someone and then psychotherapy.net uh… allowing me to show the video clips of Mary, this is the video called cognitive treatment of phobias, I think it's called. So just to orient us because you wouldn't want me to be biased in any way this is the last unbiased slide you will see. Umm… If we just put in context what we're about to talk about cognitive behavioral therapy which we all know is that really the gold standard treatment for anxiety disorders. Here's what we're doing we're looking at there, we're not doing a lot with the past, we're gonna go into the present moment as sorry now… I'm divergent already as quickly as I can, I'm gonna go in the present moment. Somebody sits down across from (inaudible) they wanna start their history and I ask… and I ask them to stop their history and let's just talk about what's been going on in the last couple of weeks that they don't like, that they want fixed. Because I wanna be listening if I'm gonna listen to the past, I wanna listen to the past based on what's the present complaint. I don't wanna be absorbing information that's not helpful to me. So we're gonna look at current thinking, then we're gonna look at whatever might be involved in these perceptions that they hold. I am a cognitive therapist, so I'm gonna be looking at belief systems, what is your point of view, your attitude, your disposition, your orientation, your cognitive set, your cognitive schema. Do I have to keep going, all the same? That… that's… that's the critical piece that I'm gonna pay attention to with them. And then what are the enduring patterns that come out of that. I do believe most anxiety disorders are genetic. There's the presupposing the setup is genetic. What we're gonna pay attention to which I think we should be doing is what maintains them. Because what maintains them as this clever manipulation of the disorder, regarding the person's response to what has been happening. We do not wanna… I say to my clients "We're not working on the symptoms. We are working on your response to the symptoms. The symptoms will change when they decide, they wanna change. We're gonna work on getting you out of the way to give it a chance to change." So that's what you and I are gonna pay attention to. Cognitive behavioral therapy is collaborative. This is critically important to our work and you're gonna see this early on. I… I think when we're talking here, I… I do not present technique at all. What I present is a strategy and I want them on board with me regarding the strategy before we begin. I don't want them to do anything that they don't understand. Here's another thing I say to them, which is provocative, which is "Don't do anything that you don't wanna do, only do what you wanna do." It's a cardinal rule for me. Only do what you wanna do, the corollary is if you wanna get stronger, you have to wanna do the hard stuff. But don't be trying to comply with what I'm asking for. You're working on ownership that's what's really important and this is a self-help mob. Anxiety disorders run the lifecycle, we need to be giving them a protocol, we need to install a protocol that will be available to them three years from now, when your long gone, they haven't had symptoms in two and a half years and suddenly symptoms or back, we want them to be able to brush off those skills and start up again. So we're gonna emphasize the present, we're gonna emphasize positive outcomes. I want a good positive outcome there because standing (inaudible) facing an anxious moment and the threatening moment is quite difficult. I want a picture out there that is larger than my threat. I want this strongly enough that I'm willing to do this. Here's the other piece, I want this strongly enough so I'm willing to do this. And I am gonna trust that the treatment you're offering me is gonna get me there. Now here's the other tricky thing is when you're working with somebody with anxiety, they have to act as though they trust you. They can't trust you because the disorder doesn't allow them to. Anxiety disorders are disorders of uncertainty, very clever around that. So they're standing there about to do something you're asking them to and they're gonna say to themselves, this seems like a really bad idea and they got to have another point of view that they can grab on after that. And so there is psychoeducation that's going on. You're gonna see Mary in a little bit, about in 45 minutes or so and Mary's got, you know, afraid of airplanes and her heart, and she's gonna suffocate and so forth. She… We have to get the content out of the way, let's talk about that. Can we get the content out of the way? Because we got to work on uncertainty and distress. Well, Mary's gotta decide that are heart is okay. Mary's got to decide she's not gonna suffocate on the plane. That's content, we gotta help her get there. Now if Mary came in with OCD that would be different contents pretty immediately some we can push it out of the way. So there is… But what I wanna convey to the client is, our job is to work until the content is not there. I just saw a guy the last two days, two days in a row because he's coming started having, you know, he's got panic disorder, he's had these spontaneous panic attack. He… he travels for a career, he's a young professional in this job and he can't travel now. He's got to get up and get going. So, you know, yesterday I was doing interoceptive exposure with him, but first I'm saying to him, he's not gonna get better until he decides his heart's okay. It's okay, if he doesn't feel that way in the moment, he's having the panic but sitting here with me in this room, he needs to have the understanding, my heart is fine. If he hadn't got that then he's gonna be, you know, split consciousness, you got one foot out the door and one foot trying to do the work. So I'm gonna show you video… two clips around, a demonstration subdue came up in front of a conference and I just asked (inaudible) how long I was here I probably would diagnose her with generalized anxiety disorder if she came into my office. So she worries about a number of things which she has to do, right. So she worries about she's got a… a child, who lives across the country, who is unemployed, and she worries about him and she calls him every day to check in and so forth. She has legitimate physical problems and yet she lets them cause her worry all day long, which is not gonna work. She would like to change jobs but she feels uncertain about that and so she worries in and so forth. Umm… And then she worries about paying her bills and also procrastinates about paying her bills, right. So, you know, there they are. So one of the things we wanna do is, I wanna… I wanna pay attention to all four of those items, get the details about it. But as soon as I can, I gonna chunk them up. So you may hear me say I don't know which clips I'm using but, you know, we can start off talking about her son that's… that's the opening video you're gonna see. And… and then when she talks about her heart, well, I'm was gonna say is (inaudible) or her physical (inaudible) say well, once I understand and got the deeds (inaudible) that sounds a lot like what you do with your son, right. Right and she agrees and so then… then we're up here. When I mean chunking it up, it means now we've got a theme going with all her worries, and we can work up here at this level not down here at this level. Down here in the content, down here in the details is the anxiety disorders territory, it loves details, it wants you to work out everything with a fine brush. I'm mixing metaphors now (inaudible). I don't. You know, what I mean. Go with it. Here's the other concept that you're gonna see really quickly and if you don't catch it, you'll see my hand go up here and point. And in any time, you see my hand point over here, it's like "Oh, something's coming up or listen to this or there it is, right." So I'll… I'll point that out to you but very quickly I find a hook, right. Because this is what we want, we want them to look at the problem in such a way as to call into question their solution. And I want her to go "Oh, I've been thinking it's this. Maybe it's this. Maybe it's this." I just want her to be interested in that and then we can run with that, she doesn't have to believe you, just be curious about that. You'll also hear a couple of times where she'll say "Oh, that… that's helpful to me or that's useful to me or that's interesting to me." And I will say "Why?" And I'm not asking her why to go tell me how clever I was then, right. Why because now she's got (inaudible) first she's gonna crystallize what she's learning by telling me about it. Second is I don't know what's interesting, let me find out. I'm curious too and so we wanna bring this curiosity forward from us. If you can have enough confidence as the therapists that you know basically where you're going, then just start being why did that happen? That's what we're looking for. We're gonna talk about signals versus noise and hopefully that'll make it clear to you when we talk about that. And this is the other piece that I was saying to you about once the anxiety disorders shows up how are they maintaining it. And here's one of the ways they're maintained in there which is this getting rid of process. I gotta get rid of it, right. And, you know, as a cognitive behavioral therapists those of you who are, if you… you're known in your community, people refer people to you all the time for symptoms. You're… you're job is to get rid of the symptoms with them. I get that of course that's how we build our reputation. But you gotta getting rid of the symptoms and the process of getting rid of symptoms are totally different. You cannot focus on getting rid of symptoms. You as a therapist can't focus on that either. So we gotta focused on something else, let's hope to goodness we come up with something else, right. You'll hear in the second clip what I say to her, where I'm going with everybody is I want this… I want this, I want what's going on, right. There's this kind of mindfulness piece here, but this is mindfulness plus but I want this. And one of the things I want is I wanna feel awkward, clumsy, insecure, unsure, embarrassed, right. It's really, you know, when I work with socially anxious people it's… it's such a mistake when they're focused on this stuff out here… this stuff out here provokes a feeling of shame so to speak that they don't wanna feel and I think our job is to go. I can be with my sense of shame. They are (inaudible) tomorrow afternoon I'm gonna talk all about self talk, which I think is just a core piece (inaudible) I can be with my shame. And if I can have that perspective response, frame of reference around the shame, things start moving in a different way, trust me. And then here we are with generalized anxiety disorder and what I'll say to her and I… You know, I'm gonna do like I do with you, when I get to this piece with her what the purpose of generalized anxiety disorders do get into the present moment, that's our job, all right. I'll explain that to her in a minute. You'll also hear me anchor stuff that she says, you know, (inaudible) we wanna… this workshop is really about how to move quickly in the beginning, right. So anything she's doing that's right or already doing that's right, I wanna embellish and highlight, and if she says something that is on… on-target I wanna go, excellent, exactly, keep doing that, that's a good way to think about it. So here we are, I can't hear very well these speakers there in front of me, so if there's a problem with the volume, you let me know, otherwise we'll move along. How's the volume? What would you do with all the other worries about your son when they pop up? 

00:16:00
BARBARA Let them go. 

00:16:05
REID WILSON How would you do that? 

00:16:05
BARBARA Self-talk. 

00:16:05
REID WILSON What would you say? 

00:16:10
BARBARA I would say "Stop worrying. He's okay. He's… he's not a kid anymore. He's, you know, have faith in his ability to handle it. And… and if he can't well that's his path in his journey. 

00:16:20
REID WILSON Do you already do that to yourself? 

00:16:25
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:16:25
REID WILSON And how's that going? 

00:16:30
BARBARA Well, pretty good. Yeah. 

00:16:30
REID WILSON I don't see anything wrong with that strategy. I think it's fine if you say those things to yourself, but there's some reason that's not working. Do you have a sense of what… So what's the other voice that pops up to compete with it? 

00:16:40
BARBARA I think a lot of it depends on how secure I'm feeling in myself during the course of a day or week. If I'm feeling, you know, really grounded and everything's going okay, then I don't worry… 

00:16:55
REID WILSON Oh, that's great. I like that a lot. So what you're saying… Wait a minute. This about me, right now I'm having… I'm getting the signal that I'm hearing I… you know, I need to worry about him, but wait a minute I'm misinterpreting the signal. This is about me. 

00:17:10
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:17:10
REID WILSON And I'm feeling insecure about something about myself. And how… Listen to this question. How do you feel about feeling insecure? 

00:17:25
BARBARA I'm tempted to say well, (inaudible) how does anybody, but, you know, obviously it's not a good feeling but again… 

00:17:30
REID WILSON Well, how do you feel about? And I know it's not a good feel. How you feel? What's your opinion about noticing that you feel insecure? 

00:17:35
BARBARA That's my opinion about it. 

00:17:40
REID WILSON Yeah, is that okay? 

00:17:40
BARBARA Well, no. It's not okay, do not feel secure. Umm… I think you first have… I shouldn't tell you. I think I would probably first have to be in touch with the fact that I'm not feeling good about myself. 

00:17:55
REID WILSON When you know what we're talking about doing. When my worry about my son pops up, I step back for a moment and go is this signal or is this noise regarding my son. Now we're adding a piece here, regarding my son. Because it may be a signal for you, I'm feeling insecure. But it's not a signal about your son. So when you keep going down the path of the signal that my son, you're mistreating yourself so to speak because it's not the right topic. So… 

00:18:35
BARBARA It's very interesting what you're saying to me. 

00:18:35
REID WILSON Why? 

00:18:35
BARBARA Because… because I'm realizing that umm… many times I'm feeling unworthy or I'm feeling, you know, those old feelings pop up that, that say, you know, you're not okay and… and there is a connection apparently. 

00:18:50
REID WILSON Very clear good. 

00:18:50
BARBARA And I didn't realize that. 

00:18:55
REID WILSON Now very good. 

00:18:55
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:18:55
REID WILSON You've got that very… that's… that's very powerful, right. And so that's what we're saying about try to clean things up. So we're not up here going, don't worry… don't worry, stop worrying. 

00:19:10
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:19:10
REID WILSON You say that enough to yourself and probably other people do, your family does too, right. It was not about that it's like what is… So what were you and I are going, not some kind of formula, but for you right now it's like "Oh, wait a minute. Maybe a lot of my worry is a signal, but let me pick up on the signal." Now I'm gonna… I'm gonna give you a friendly amendment about what you said about your insecurity. So I was just (inaudible) I'm your consultancy, you can throw this away later on. But I would consider the possibility of being okay that you feel insecure. 

00:19:45
BARBARA Mm-hmm. 

00:19:45
REID WILSON It's okay that I feel insecure? 

00:19:45
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:19:45
REID WILSON Do you really have to get rid of feeling insecure? How's it going anyway? 

00:19:50
BARBARA Mm-hmm. 

00:19:50
REID WILSON Right. (inaudible) good luck on that. Even if I'm an insecure person and so do you have to make it not okay that you're insecure. So here we have a signal that pops up "Oh, I got a call, you know, I hope he's okay." Okay, so wait a minute let me just see… Now I'll give you little secret around this, just you got the signal and noise idea, right, so in the moment if you have a worry pop up and you step back to determine whether it's a signal or noise, you just separate yourself from your worry, which is what you and I wanna accomplish. Don't (inaudible) worry running me ragged or separate a little bit. So simply the decision is this a signal or this noise, or what is this, it really about him. You know, the fear flying thing example. 

00:20:40
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:20:45
REID WILSON Oh, it says I hear that palette, you know, something just boomed down that's a signal. What's a signal? It's a signal that I'm not feeling in control being on this plane that's… that's the signal, right. So… 

00:20:55
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:20:55
REID WILSON All right so now we're doing little complex thing here where you going "Okay, it's a signal maybe it's a signal about me feeling insecure and then I'm adding, I'm making a suggestion to you to consider I actually don't have to do anything about the fact that I'm feeling insecure right now other than acknowledge it and be okay with it. What would that be like for you, if you just try it on for a moment? 

00:21:20
BARBARA Oh, I think that would be great. I… I think one of the keys and I just heard from you that to helping me work this out is that when I find myself worrying, first distinguishing whether its noise or, you know, something I have to do something about it and then… and then realizing that… that… that signal is signaling something about me because very often I'm not in touch with "Why I don't feel so well about myself I'm doesn't feel so happy with who I am today or whatever… 

00:21:55
REID WILSON Well, who wants to get in touch with that anyway? 

00:21:55
BARBARA So I… I don't realize that yeah… 

00:21:55
REID WILSON Listen, Barbara, it's a universal experience. 

00:22:00
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:22:00
REID WILSON Who wants to get in touch with that, right? 

00:22:00
BARBARA Mm-hmm. 

00:22:00
REID WILSON So it is a difficult piece, but it would really be a good idea to know if that's what's happening to you, you should do it. Now what do you think about the idea of being okay with noticing that right at this moment (inaudible) this because really we wanna do with worry is get into the present moment and this present moment as we clean it up is I'm feeling insecure. What do you think about going? I… I can handle feeling insecure what would that do in the moment if you did that? 

00:22:40
BARBARA Oh, I think it would lift a lot of burden from me. It's a kind of thing I would tell my clients as you know, it's okay not to feel okay, you know, its… that's you know, you can live through that and whatever. 

00:22:50
REID WILSON But well, you were asking earlier was I wanna feel serene and calm, does that move you in that direction. 

00:22:55
BARBARA Yeah. Oh, yeah. 

00:22:55
REID WILSON Could you actually be serene about feeling insecure. That mean, conceptually you can imagine that? 

00:23:05
BARBARA Yeah, I could feel. (inaudible) If I knew I wasn't feeling… Yeah, that's definitely. It sounds almost like my worrying is actually umm… a good tool to use it's a good signal I didn't realize that. 

00:23:20
REID WILSON Okay, so about 15, roughly 15 minutes into the session, she has done a 180-degree turn where she says to me "Oh, well, it sounds like guy where is the good signal, all right. So now we're messing with things. Let me show you one more clip with her to give you a few more pointers around it and you guys are doing well being so patient with me. 

00:23:50
BARBARA Again if I'm feeling in a good place or you know things are going well, then I can differentiate, you know, between the… the symptoms… 

00:24:00
REID WILSON Oh, we just don't need it. Just talk about when you feel in a good place then. 

00:24:00
BARBARA Well, I think now I think when I'm in a good place I… 

00:24:05
REID WILSON I mean, you just talked about when you are in a bad place. 

00:24:05
BARBARA When I'm… Yeah, when I'm not which is not always something I'm in touch with but… but if I'm not in a good place, you know, emotionally, mentally whatever, then a symptom can be scary even when it's not if… if that makes sense, you know, even when I know I'm somewhat (inaudible) serious. 

00:24:25
REID WILSON What do we think of that? So what do we think of that? When I'm not in a good place I misinterpret what's going on inside me as a wary about a physical symptom. 

00:24:30
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:24:35
REID WILSON And what could I do about? What does that tell us that I wanna do at those (inaudible). 

00:24:40
BARBARA Step back. 

00:24:40
REID WILSON Was, I mean, is it similar to… 

00:24:40
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:24:40
REID WILSON Your son, worry about your son. So we've got another example, a huge example, my physical health. That when I feel like I'm not in a good place, physically, emotion… or emotionally or psychologically. 

00:24:50
BARBARA Mm-hmm. 

00:24:55
REID WILSON I divert that attention over to my physical. So now I do you have another question about that which, you know, is why… why… why not… How does… how is it happened if you know if you can make a guess that the concerns you have which seem to be where we get to about my security or how I'm doing and so forth, you divert your attention away from those. Do you have any clue about how come that's happening? Why are you not going into those directly? 

00:25:30
BARBARA Maybe I think I'm not them not in touch uh… or you know… I don't know. 

00:25:40
REID WILSON But you understand theoretically we'd (inaudible) to go how come (inaudible) you know, when I'm feeling uncomfortable about myself why am I not just notice… 

00:25:45
BARBARA Yeah, why don't I just do something about that? 

00:25:45
REID WILSON No, why am I not noticing that initially. What am I noticing these other things. So I (inaudible) you know, don't think we're gonna have necessarily an answer to that today, but I think that would be something to be going. 

00:25:55
BARBARA Yeah, that's actually very good I think to look at. 

00:26:00
REID WILSON Why… why would think that? 

00:26:00
BARBARA Yeah, I would think that, you know, there is certain amount of, you know, conditioning that goes on in the course of one's life, you know, things that happen as your child. I mean, I… I know personally that I pretty much learn not to pay much attention to myself, you know, that I… it was not necessary to… That was not a good thing, you know, sand so I understand what you're saying actually makes it resonates with me, I understand what you're saying. 

00:26:30
REID WILSON Okay, so I'm gonna add one thing to it and it's a huge piece that we haven't talked about yet. 

00:26:35
BARBARA Yeah. 

00:26:35
REID WILSON So its… But it's time to talk about that which is if you are truly a worrier, then what you do is you avoid instead of approach, fine. So what you and I wanna be shaping which we're doing is how do you approach instead of avoid, so you've been approaching the topic now my physical ailments and that kind of thing, which is an avoidance of the true thing that you need to approach, which is, you know, this more nebulous things or (inaudible) how am I doing emotionally or my insecurity about change in job that kind of that you wanna identify, the money, the family, all those kind of things as I approach those in my worry, how am I using them to avoid approaching something else and we're touching upon today as we talk about it maybe the approach the avoidance is about something like (inaudible) maybe I go away, I don't know what to do. If I really pay attention to that would be something you might wanna be exploring with somebody. And so the thing you would not approach would be something that you perceive is very large with a big challenge and you perceive you are having minimal skills to face the challenge, so you'd perceive the challenge large and you perceive your skills to be minimal, so somewhere along the way you've decided, I don't wanna be paying attention to this part of me because it seems too big and I can't do it, right. So if you're gonna approach that you have to or you'd like to have (inaudible). 

00:28:20
BARBARA I don't mind. 

00:28:25
REID WILSON I'm gonna suggest you should wanna. 

00:28:25
BARBARA Yes. 

00:28:25
REID WILSON How's that? 

00:28:30
BARBARA Fine, good. 

00:28:30
REID WILSON What… what I have found works best. 

00:28:30
BARBARA Mm-hmm. 

00:28:35
REID WILSON When you approach a challenge like that is that you seek out being clumsy, awkward, unsure, insecure that you seek those out. Those are the feelings that go along with exploring something that you're not sure you can master. So if you gonna do this you, you gotta be a, you know, when you say "Oh, boy, I'm really feeling insecure." 

00:29:00
BARBARA Mm-hmm. 

00:29:05
REID WILSON It's okay, fine. You know, one is just to be okay with it and then the other is to go okay, go and what am I being insecure about it and in what way can I go toward that. 

00:29:15
BARBARA Mm-hmm. 

00:29:15
REID WILSON The work with worry is to create an understanding of the problem in such a way as you go toward it instead of away from it. Okay, so just a couple of highlights about all that. You know, people in act would say this is experiential avoidance she's… she's gonnaward all these worries and she's avoiding this stuff, this insecurity inside her. Then, I also was trying to explain to her it's like well, what did we avoid, we avoid challenges that we perceive as great, you know, catastrophizing when we perceive our skills to be low who the world's gonna approach that, that's ridiculous so we have to do something around, you know, decatastrophizing some of these things like I'll do with Mary around her heart and suffocation and so forth and then increase the skill level, then I'll start to be more swilling to approach it. The other thing I was just point out to you was she starts talking about psychodynamic material and so that's fine just, you know, when that shows up if… if I tend to go at, you know, I'm symptom focused, chief complaint focused with my clients. They'll let me know if that's not gonna work. They'll get confused about what I'm saying or they'll miss appointments or they will not do their homework or whatever and, you know, if I need to back up in (inaudible) and we'll go look at the sum of the psychodynamic stuff. Just as (inaudible) this doesn't belong here at all, but when you're working with these kind of folks, you know, I'm introducing this new schema for you, you should lead with what you do best. If you're a mindful base… mindfulness-based therapist, lead with mindfulness. If you're psychodynamic reorient and trained, lead with that because placebo is huge in our field, huge. And you wanna lead with your best stuff, so that they end up trusting you about that. The other way that they trust you is if you just understand what the… what's been happening to them minimally, let's help them walk out the door in the first session to say "Thank God, I finally met someone who understands what's going on for me" that has huge benefits to you. So now if you were here at the beginning you got a copy of this. I had 140 books and they're gone. Umm… If you're here and it's not there, there's a little card there. I'm offering to you for less than what I pay for it. I would like this out in the world, so I'm saying that. Uh… The other reason I'm putting this up here because I've got slides now that you're gonna see that are the graphics out of that book and I'm acknowledging HCI books for that. So we've got four problems that we're looking out with people with anxiety disorders. So let's get… let's get all this stuff in place and then I'm gonna show you a little bit with Mary to understand how it works with somebody. We've got attentional bias towards perceived threat, we should assume, you should assume everybody that you see with an anxiety disorder has been traumatized already. Whatever it is they have a trauma. So if they've had a trauma, they've got a fear structure set up in their brain and we're going after that fear structure. And of course, they've been traumatized and they feel like the challenges are too great and their skills are too low, that's why they're stuck, that's why they're seeing you. Now if you were, you know, I live out in the country and if you were walking down the sidewalk to come visit me, please don't I'm an introvert but let's just hypothetically speaking. Umm… Occasionally you might come across a snake that looks a great deal like a copper head and not necessarily would be probably be a corn snake but umm… now if you're like me, you'll probably jumped back squeeze like a little child, you know, and then maybe approach it or whatever. Now what happens the next three or four days, every stick is a snake, every garden hose is a snake, every rustling in the leaves is a snake. Why? Because the unconscious said to you basically "Hey, boss, sorry I was not on guard and I wasn't protecting you and you almost got injured badly, but I'll on it now. I'm gonna find any snake around here and you're gonna be ready for it before it startles you like that, right." And so what that… So here you're defensive system that might be shoulder, right now drops to your waist and you're now picking up cues that you never would've noticed. You think about people with panic disorder, they're in grocery store they feel little skipped heartbeat, you know, and then they notice it, right. So now… now what happens next three or four days, you have that startle response and then you know, you go… There's that, you know, dog leash in the garage and I thought it was a snake. Umm… This is how the amygdala learns to repair the fear structure. We're looking to have a place our clients in a safe reasonable facsimile of the threatening circumstance and let the amygdale hang out, that's its job… just that's our job is just to hang out and it will learn that that was then and this is now. That's what happens when you see the stick and the garden hose and the rustling, you… you have that response you have, you know, you have the adrenaline surge and now you've got that circumstance and then you modify the fear structure and gradually over time this fades. People with anxiety disorders can't do that well that's our job. Second is there seems to be kind of character trait around, people needing to feel certain these are disorders of uncertainty. They only live inside people who must feel certain. Now it's gonna be need to feel certain regarding this thing, right. And also need to get to comfort, right. Well I love certainty, I loved to be right. Just ask my wife, it's… it's very important to me and I like to be relaxed and so forth. Not when we're trying to learn something new, you gotta be awkward clumsy insecure so on to learn any new skill, try learning a new foreign language, right. And then I'm gonna judge my skills as low. So there… We have these four things and these four things we have to address with them to help them get better. Now paranoid schizophrenics who think that the NSA has its plan and a probe in their brain listening to everything that they're saying and giving them instructions, they can do some really kooky things but it makes totally good sense within that frame of reference. An anxious person who's had this experience and has these beliefs that's the frame of reference in which they come up with their strategies, one is I can't trust myself, I… I need crutches, I need to be with my partner at all times, I need to carry my cell phone with me, I need to take my Xanax, I need to never get on an elevator if there's more than two people on it and, you know, on and on because I can't do it any other way so they're gonna rely on crutches they're gonna be vigilant because they don't know when it's gonna happen next, they're gonna remain vigilant until they learn the number one crutch in the world is what? Avoidance. Once they learned to avoid, they stop being vigilant. The cost is their world gets very small. They're gonna come in and see you, they want the outcome, they don't want the process. They wanna get stronger, they don't wanna do what it takes to get there because now they're gonna have to feel insecure and that doesn't seem like a really good idea, they wanna resist and avoid and avoid and resist and resist and avoid. You… Here's double-negative. You can't have a client with an anxiety disorder sitting across from you unless they're resisting something. You got that, right? They have to be resisting something in order to be stuck. So what we do instead we have they come in resisting, we can… If you're following me on the camera (inaudible) way over here but I guess its fine. So we wanna move them over here to permit, right. It's okay, I have these feelings, I can handle these feelings. But this is a very difficult stance to take if you are using resistance. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go over here to provocative. You can't give me enough anxiety. I eat uncertainty for breakfast. This is I want more of this because it doesn't matter what we have them do, it matters what they stopped doing. So it's really easy when they get over here to do permission kind of things I can handle this because inside their mind they say "Oh my God! I hope this works because if I have a panic attack that'll be awful, right." Over here if even if they're terribly clumsy students of a paradoxical approach, if they really try this… this will fade out a default, you know, this is a zero sum game when we got 100% of our consciousness. We start bring an attention over to the therapeutic process that negative stuff will fade by default. So we gotta fix and change all those things. The most important thing we gonna think about is everything they do is defensive. You can't win a game, this is about the anxiety disorders game that's what rich named this one so that wasn't my name for it, but you can't win a game if everything you do is defends it. You wanna watch the NCAA basketball, competitions going on now see if you can find teams that only have defense and have no offence, there you won't find them because they're not in the running because they've already left the place, so we gotta do something other than let them be defensive. They're gonna be defensive because the anxiety disorders says this, right, "This is serious, this is a signal you just had that sensation that means something's wrong, you need to change that. We're coming over here and building another frame of reference, which is… Now wait a minute that's I know what's going on there's… there's anxiety trying to get me that's not what's going on, something else is going on, right. So that's what we're working on here. So here's a graphic of… of a pendulum, right. So if you've got kids or grandkids or nephews, nieces whatever and you're out in the playground that's… that's the swing, right. So when… when she says "Uncle, Pete, please push me higher, push me I wanna go higher… I wanna go higher." What does Uncle, Pete do? He's gonna he's gonna add energy to his side of the swing. The only way she's gonna swing higher is if uncle, Pete pushes harder and provides energy, that's what we're talking about here. My resistance, my need to get rid of whatever it is I'm experiencing, adds fuel to the fire. I'm gonna… I'm mixing metaphors again, gonna swing on that other end and grab more fear, more anxiety, more doubt, more dread and back it comes and now I feel awful I'm gonna push again, right. That's what goes on. I'm just working with somebody with I do a two-day treatment group umm… for just, you know, doing intensive work for people with about eight people and I have a client in my current practice, who did that and that was two weeks ago for him, yeah, social anxiety and… and he… I saw on Wednesday and he said "Boy, that first week, I did great man, I was bringing it, you know, I started having symptoms… Come on, you know, I'm fine, great." This week I've just had this yucky feeling, I'm just like I just… I don't have it (inaudible) I'm disappointed and blah… blah… blah. Okay, I'm not gonna go on that story, but… but you know there's his mistake. Just fine, the only way you learn to make mistake. His mistake is he's doing great and pushing away these symptoms and so forth. If he gets that old crummy feeling again he goes with that and he has a reaction of "Oh, it's bad, you know, week two and I'm already getting back to the old way," right. So there he's haven't that… I don't want this, I don't like this so we worked on, fine this is happening, I talked a little bit about, you know, when the feelings come up, I can deal with these feelings. So four things I'm gonna say to you about what we need to do. And the first is to step back. This is that, you know, all the stuff around mindfulness is fine, fits right in here, you heard what I was just saying with… with Barbara, it's like you need to step back and decide whether the worry I just had was a signal or noise. And what I was trying to convey to her is, you know, before you even decide is this a signal or is it noise, the whole process of stepping back is a separation from the obsession and that already gives me some help. So we're talking about stepping back, we wanna step back in two ways, we gonna step back from the content. So we're gonna see a little bit around Mary, she's gonna work on that, her heart issue and the suffocation issue and… and so forth and panic attacks and so forth. She gotta step back and go wait a minute that's not what's going on here. I have to be aware of that. And the second thing is in the moment I have to step back, so it's two… those two big pieces. If they don't step back away from the content of their obsessions and worries, we're not gonna get anywhere. They're gonna worship at two altars and just not gonna work. Your should… You should be the only God that's with a small g in the room, right. So and it is just like this is, just, you know, like all we're doing step one is like "Okay, it's happening," if they can do that that's (inaudible) why very often we'll have people just say "Hey, look between now and the next session, if you would just log in, you know, all the cognitive behavioral stuff we do is login the thoughts that pop up and… and we can talk about it next time, that's the stepping back process, let's get good at that. In the end, stepping back is all they need to do. Is mindfulness is beautiful, it's great, its fine, you know, we were talking about with… with Barbara "Okay, I'm having this feeling" that's fine so you see the difference in this graphic from the last one, which is now I've got my hands behind my back and I'm just not add in any fuel to this fire burning pendulum so. And now since I'm not pushing that… that circles called the (inaudible) right. So I'm not pushing on the bob, it will gradually. It's got no energy, it's just gonna fade, he's just gonna jump out and get into somebody else's skin, sorry for them, but at least I will be bettered by that point. That's what we're looking for around the stepping back process. The second is and this is where you (inaudible) this is where you can throw away everything that I tell you because people don't talk about this and I think we should be talking about this, so here I am talking about this throw this away at the end of the workshop if you would like, but this is what's missing, which is not step back and then step up, you know, you don't have your mindset. Yeah, let's get your mindset before you do that. We're gonna feel this way, right. The threat, I'm standing in front of the threat and my message us I don't want that, right. So I got two things that are gonna happen automatically. You know, the… the physical sensations (inaudible) show up and then I'm gonna have a negative reaction to them that shows up and that's fine. Those are throw-away, we don't have to change those. The stuff is unconsciously mediated, we do not need to consciously change something that's unconsciously mediated. We just need to step away from it and then now I'm gonna be talking about a (inaudible) misstep away from and then I'm gonna want it, right, so this graph is I want you to see the detail of this graph because what's in gray here is the critical piece that we just talked about which is your… your clients will tell you this, you know, they already argue in their head. They got their, you know, negative thought that comes up and then they bring their therapeutic thought that comes up and then they just argue (inaudible) I shouldn't be doing (inaudible) I just got to; I'll never relax (inaudible) so far. Well, that's not gonna work. We're gonna… we're gonna allow the negative thought to come up, we're gonna bring up parallel voice in and then we're gonna elevate that voice, and by default something's gonna start changing at this point. The grey is first I wanna go not going there. I got a physician I've been working with really bright guy. He's been working with me for awhile. I do call him stupid, but, you know, just in a loving kind of way he's… he's an idiot. Umm… In a loving, now I'm gonna get bad evaluations (inaudible) you know, I rely. So, you know, he's writing, he's recording the sessions and he say "Okay, this is the protocol, this is what I wanna say, he's afraid, he's well I won't tell you what's going on, but umm… and, you know, there's just (inaudible) he's gets caught up in it again it (inaudible) he comes in three weeks ago and he says "Well, you know, because as soon as he wakes up in the morning, it begins, the obsession begins, you know, what's blah… blah… blah. And he said, you know, I've seen him Tuesday afternoon and he said, you know, Monday I woke up and I said and it started and I said "Not today. Not happening today" I said "Yes," right, that's it. Screw writing down what you should say to yourself, screw what… what's the protocol say, he shifted his attitude. He got big. He… his voice went down an octave, not doing it, right, I'm not doing it. That's now he didn't hold onto that very long, but that was the moment we go back to that a lot so I wanna detach from that content, detach what's going from it and going and it's not that and then go toward what do I want next. I have my only grandchild lives out… lives out in LA, umm… three-year-old (inaudible) so I was out there in July… last July and about block and a half, believe it or not if you don't know this LA is building a metro system, so… so they're doing a major metro center right down the street from them and so she was wanted to bring me down to the construction site, you know, she's all excited two and a half, so she and I went down there and we were looking and I said "Emma, this is… actually this isn't the construction site. This is a destruction site, right". She loved that word, she came back with destruction, right. Because they're in there with the (inaudible) tearing the walls down so forth, right. We got to hear down what's here, move it out then you'll see them start building, then it'll be the construction site. We have to tear up the frame of reference that's driving the disorder before we can come in and introduce the new frame of reference, and I'm saying this to you and you should say to your clients that's… that's how we wanna be thinking about this because we want them to be taking on this project. So here's how we're working on change in response to a tough moment, right. Here's what I said happens automatically, you feel something unpleasant, you mentally feel your resistance, I don't want this, I wanna get rid of this, you wanna step back and notice it, and then you wanna drop that resistance. You wanna detect… there's detachment of mindfulness, you know, and well, I'll move to a position of acceptance so that you can decide what to do next. This is getting into the present moment. Resistance is going, I don't want this, right. Miller talked about this, you know, (inaudible) mind can only hold onto seven plus or minus two chunks of information in one moment. He was wrong, it can only hold onto four chunks of information in one moment. We do not wanna be chewing up working memory with "Oh, no, I can't believe this is back again… This is gonna be hard". How am I ever gonna get out of this problem? You wanna just cleared away and say 'Okay, well, this is what's happening.' Why in the world who would you except the present moment because it's the present moment, right. That's… that's what we're working on with people, get in the present moment, so here we have. You know, there's the obsession or the… the word get me out of here, the urge to run and avoid, and then I step back and go 'Okay, I'm scared myself' and then I stepped back again I'm… I want this. I want this so that I can… Well, there's a lot of reasons why I wanna say 'I want this' maybe I'll get to it, I don't know we'll see, but, you know, I want this to get me in the present so I can be available for what happens next. I want what's happening right now because the anxiety disorder requires that 'I not want it,' so I'm gonna do the opposite of what the disorder want, I want it because fascinating research that's being done now. Barbara Fredrickson's doing stuff out of you and see where I am umm… Les Greenberg said his whole career about this. Davidson's doing this work too. In essence, it goes like this. You… Maybe you're again I may have a slide on this. You call up fear and you have fear kicked off in… in the brain, you call up another emotion that competes with fear and gravitate towards that and it will their word transform. I'm not using that word there isn't about transform fear. Now I'm… I'm gonna throw a little… say it differently. I don't worry about people calling up a different emotion, that's a lot more difficult than most of our clients can do. I'm gonna ask them to call up a different attitude. They would have emotion behind it if you get to it, but I'm gonna have, you know, not today is a different state of mind than what keeps feeding the disorder. So I've said this to you already. So I wanna have an honest stance towards whether it's my symptoms or my worry or my doubt and uncertainty, right. I wanna purposely voluntarily choose to what, what I'm experiencing right now. Now what we're talking about here is this habituation, definition of habituation 'frequency, intensity, duration,' right. So and although we're really throwing the habituation model out the window now if you don't know that that's interesting work to be thinking about. Michelle (inaudible) is doing a lot of this work. If you… if you know she is at UCLA. But the… the principles of habituation overcoming a phobia requiring frequency, intensity, duration can justify the point of view that we're talking about here, which is, you know, frequency I want… I gotta go get my content. OCD, your panic disorder, social anxiety wants me to stay in my content try to correct content. I just need to go get it to stimulate a generic sense of doubt and distress. Of course, it'll be about this topic but I… I got to go on myself that's now… I'm not… It's not about this topic, its about this feeling. And then I wanna want this now if it sticks around, right, duration. If it sticks around, I wanted to stick around. If it gets more intense or the intensity stays, then I want that. Because that's what's happening and I'm not gonna get caught up in my resistance. And we've talked about this already about the amygdala 'Why I wanna say, I want this.' You know, if you're… you're trying to get over the fear of the elevator, you got, you know, frequency, you gotta ride up and down the elevator a bunch, you know, we've within session habituation and then you wanna actually, you know, get your distress level going because we're looking to create a reasonable facsimile of the traumatic event and the traumatic event had distress, so I want my distress to be up there at 50 or higher, and then duration, I wanna keep riding up and down that elevator for 45 minutes. Because you know, in minute 45, it'll be a little different than it was at minute one. However, if while you're doing that your prefrontal cortex comes in and says 'Oh, my God! How many more times I have to ride this he's making me do it for half hour, oh, my God, so 20 minutes… I got ten more minutes, God! I hope… I hope that cable is stable and what if other people get on here, it'll be crowded, it's gonna freaked me out, you know, all. If the prefrontal cortex shows up and starts talking like that you're… you're screwed, you might as well not do the practice. Because it's undoing everything you do, right, with work from the… I'm not gonna tell this story. Okay, I'll tell the story. I've been telling this story so long that when I first started telling it I said 'I was working with an older gentleman.' I'm now ten years older than him, so but anyway it's useful. So he's got social anxiety and he was diagnosed with familial… involuntary familial tremor. He's, you know, his handshake and less he takes a shot of whiskey then he's fine, right. So but and so, you know, he can't… he can't bring food up to his mouth, a fork up to his mouth. He can't bring a glass up to his mouth in public and… and he can't sign his name in public and it's all because it's shaky and people will… Something that's shaking then people will judge him as, you know, something's wrong with you. So he did this great practice. The first practice we'd done together, we drove down to the strip mall down from where I live and work. And I'd already worked it out with merchants that he would go in with my clipboard and he would sign his name to in each of the stores, five different times to the pharmacist and the manager of the grocery store and the Korean restaurant so forth. And so I wait in the parking lot. He goes in, he does this really powerful practice. He comes back out, he has gotten signed his name in front of all five of them. Hands me the clipboard, what does he say? Look how shaky my handwriting is, right. Totally useless practice because it's not about exposure, right. It's about exposure with the shift in his mindset and that's probably my, you know, I was only 14 at that point so I didn't really write, but right his attitude needed to be what Gosh! My handwriting, look at that… that is I don't even… I can't even recognize my handwriting myself, but I did it, right. (inaudible) I went in there I was really scared to death. So that's what we're talking about gotta be changing the prefrontal cortex that's why… also why we can say, you know, we look towards I want this so we can quiet down the prefrontal cortex, right, so this is just that schema uh… that we've been talking about. And I've organized a little bit. Pay attention that moment, recognize that you're having that moment and then that third line, you know, then what "Good! I'm feeling doubtful. It's exactly what I'm looking for,' right. Then you… when you notice you doubtful of course you're gonna be scared. Good! Looking… looking to be scared to, excellent this is great, just what I wanted, yeah, I feel awful, right, all… altogether. And then the last piece around wanting it is wanting the outcome that's what I said earlier on, you got this huge thing, you're trying to face, you better have a decent outcome when I do this weekend treatment group, I do one for OCD and I do another one with panic and social anxiety and… Umm… Where's Donna? Yeah, Donna has been to that as an observer. Umm… She's better now. You know, no… no. So with the OCD foundation I do if there's a pre-conference or post conference so treatment groups so that people can observe it and see what's going on. So but when we started I have people take the newsprint and say 'What have you missed out on because of this disorder?' And they'll, you know, what do you think they would call out in the room?

00:59:15
REID WILSON Joy, self-esteem, education, travel, job promotion, all that stuff. And we do a column and a half of things of all the stuff. And they, you know, they finally get into it and then I pull it off, it's on post, don't, stick it up I said 'Let's do, if it's okay with you. I'm always asking permission which is some insecurity I mentioned that I'm insecure. Yeah, so if it's okay with you, let's change… lets transform this list from what you've missed out on to what you'd like in your future. Where would that make sense to you or ask them (inaudible) people nod their head and say 'Okay, because this is what we're going for. 'You're gonna play a game here in this room, you're gonna score points, you're gonna win prizes, you're gonna win, you know, the top person's gonna win $1,000, second prize the person's gonna win $500 this gonna be great fun, you know, you're gonna walk away with money. It's actually $10 and $5, but it's a game, right. So but this is really what we're playing for, so that's what this is all about. Now let's step forward into the mire, right. And it's, you know, it does seem giant, what I'm gonna say is, you know, 'I can't do this, in the face of this terrible threat, I'm gonna try to bring forward what that therapist just tell me it's like 'Okay, that's not working for me. I do wanna get better, I do want that stuff over there. I'm not gonna be paying attention to that. I want this experience because I wanna get stronger and I know I need to keep doing this stuff and I… I think this treatment's gonna help me and, you know, all that kind of stuff.' And then you step forward with that mindset. So instead of I don't want this, we're shifted over 'Yeah, it's hard and I like it. I can handle it.' This is the problem with panic disorder, you know, when you're working with panic disorder, they can't say 'I can handle a panic attack,' until they find out they can handle a panic attack. I told you about the guy, who was having panic attacks and not traveling anymore and I said we did interoceptive exposure yesterday. Did I say that to you already, right, okay. He hated that and he wanted that. He's like I… He wants to get back to work and so I had him… We did, you know, deep inhalation and exhale quickly, and hung out for a little bit and then did three and then did ten. Then I stopped doing them. And then he did it for 30 seconds and… and we debrief it and he understood it. Now we've separated the symptoms from their context, he's not on a plane, he's not with his colleagues, he's sitting there in the room with me and he got it and he understood what we're doing. Now, he's off doing homework. I'm gonna see him on Monday. And because I'm… I wanna get him back to work but he… I wrote him a note. He's not ready to go back to… He's not ready to start traveling yet, he's not. If he's just started now, he'll just have setbacks, so. But so here's where we're working on, right. On the left is where they're gonna come in, basically on the left is gonna be the attitude of… of the disorder. I've got to protect myself and defend myself. You see that whole list above it are the principles related to that. And on the right is where we're trying to go just you don't see the word confidence here. We're not trying to do anything confidently. You got to do it 10,000 times somebody said, right, whoever it was said that, right. It's not about confidence, it's about courage, being scared, but do it anyway, right. And I must step forward and take the risk. So you see on the left, you know, the… the point of view these are all kind of points of view decision. I gotta be sure everything's okay. Swing over on the side, I'm looking for doubt. Notice it doesn't say 'I can tolerate doubt.' My opinion is tolerate is too soft, a stance. There's a lot… It can still be a lot of resistance going on when I say 'Well, I can put up with it. I can, you know, even I can handle it, its fine, but it… it also… I need to be seeking it out and then say 'No, I can't handle it,' and so I do think seeking it out is the right word to be used and if… if see the thing is you can't go tell I want this to them, yet because you haven't heard it before and so that's fine. You can even be working on. I'm… I'm willing to face this. But as you think about that, I think about how it sound if you can just get a feel of how it sounds to say 'I'm willing to do this versus I wanna do this,' there's a little more than a subtle difference between I'm willing to do it. I'll put up with it and this is what I want. That's why I think we need to keep move in that direction to the degree we can. I… I wanna get comfortable, no, I'm provoking… I'm provoking my own discomforts. Now it's like 'Oh, I'm gonna go into this situation and if I get uncomfortable, you know, I'll… I'll handle it.' No, I'm going into the situation because I'm choosing to generate discomfort that's… that's the position of power when I'm choosing it and we would like them to do that because there'll be times when it starts happening spontaneously. This kid, I'm talking about who needs to get back on the plane, you know, he's… We wanna get this stuff down because he will have a spontaneous moment that he hasn't had yet, he wants the other stuff, you know, when he starts to hyperventilate or get lightheaded, he wants to go been there done that, and then he just has to deal with the fact that he's in public (inaudible) going on. Treat fearful thoughts seriously. We're gonna treat fearful thoughts how? Absurdly, who in the world would be standing there in their bedroom thinking 'I'm having a heart attack' and they sit down on the bed and okay some people do that, but I'm just (inaudible) you know, if you're afraid you having a heart attack who would just sit there and try to relax and so forth, but that's what you do when you are having a panic attack. Stay safe, no, I'm gonna aggress into new territory. Aggress that's my job is. You feel confident for (inaudible). No, my job… What can I do this week to scare myself, right? You know, you'll get people come into your office and they'll say 'Well, I have pretty good week last… last week. Oh, tell me about it (inaudible) I didn't have a panic I didn't a… Really it was quiet. I hardly had any anxiety, no panic attacks, that's a sucky week. In treatment, that's a sucky week. What good is that, right? That just means they're gonna get blackmailed later on. I… A good week is 'Boy! (inaudible) You know, you can be sarcastic, you know, 'Great week, this week. I really got to practice,' you know, right. But still they're saying, right, it showed up I used my skills, you know, I did this whatever. I kid… I was working with they're all kids now, I should just say 'Umm… Socially anxious and, you know, he's go and buy a convenience store and he's got an assignment to go in and buy something, you know, when he can and he's going to this convenience store and he's looking in and he goes (inaudible) she's, the clerk is my age (inaudible) his girl is pretty. Well, I'm gonna get in there and I'm gonna fumble… He wants me to say something. I'm gonna, you know, I'm just gonna turn bright red and probably turn red now I'm just thinking about it, but a good opportunity to practice, you know, and the Dory goes, right, it offsets that and you go… go up one level to have that position. So we are in case you don't… you can't practice, we're stepping back and then stepping up. You get that? I'm stepping back away from the content which is happening right now and then I step up and grab another disposition, attitude about what I wanna do in this moment that's what I mean by stepping up. So now it's ridiculous drawing absurd here we are… we're doing… We're never doing paradoxical stuff, so instead of just stepping back, see, mindfulness is fine except this insufficient. It's very difficult to finish the work only doing a mindful piece of intervention. Because as I talk to you about tomorrow afternoon, if you cared to come there's a lot of great workshops going on tomorrow afternoon, but, you know, you have to talk to yourself, you have to. You're already talking to yourself, right. So you've gotta find something to say in the moment that I missed this so. So now I'm going paradoxically inviting it, I want this, I'm jumping on to the rope on top of the Bob and pulling my arm out, now I'm creating mass, it's not by weight, mass isn't weight, but its significance, its right now I am creating air friction and what I'm proposing to you is that instead of doing the stepping back mindful approach if I can be more aggressive with it, we will slow down that, Bob much more rapidly, by go and added in a more aggressive fashion. We are welcoming doubt and distress into the door, they're coming in anyway. We might as well invite them in, trying to close the door, they'll just seep through the bottom or something. So let me show you some stuff around, Mary. We're right on schedule and the way I know that is this is where we are, so right on schedule, perfect. Thank you for not asking questions right now we're on schedule enough that I think we'll have some time to answer questions, I think. I don't remember and then if you queue up I'll let you know in advance, you can queue up and asked me, and just try not to embarrass me because I'm easily embarrassed. Umm… So here's Mary, she's had this problem for about 10 years, its claustrophobia, panic disorder, she has difficulty flying and tunnels and elevators and parking garages. I'm gonna correct this information as I said around her heart and around suffocation. We're gonna do a little interoceptive exposure. This is the exposure to the… the body that's what this young man was doing with me. So, you know, one of the things if you're… if you got in your notes that you're about to see somebody new and the… you're intake person said, they have claustrophobia and you've never worked with somebody with claustrophobia, go look it up, right, and find out what are the, you know, what's the… what's the essence, so… so what's the essence of claustrophobia? Restriction of movement and suffocation. So whatever she's saying, I'm looking for that because she's got (inaudible) you know, I'm first making sure she has claustrophobia that I'm looking for that and then I wanna build everything. I'm gonna push everything into those two concepts. Because then we got something we're working on just about that. Umm… So we're gonna listen to her probably soon, oh, right now, okay. So here we go. So this is a different umm… video so I don't know how the volume is relative to the last one and I'll fix it if you tell me it's wrong. Tell me what brings you here? 

01:10:50
MARY Well, I get panic attacks and anxiety umm… about being feeling trapped in small places. So especially like flying, which is really inconvenient because I love to travel, but I feel like it takes so much out of me just to get their because uh… when I get on an airplane and hatch door closes, I suddenly realize that there's no outside air source, there's no way for me to leave and my heart starts racing and I mean, sometimes I… it's been so bad I felt like I was gonna have a heart attack. And… 

01:11:35
REID WILSON Have you stuck it out through that sometimes? Or… 

01:11:40
MARY Well… 

01:11:40
REID WILSON You figured out not to do that? 

01:11:40
MARY There're certain things that I do. Umm… Like I'll only take an aisle seat close to the front where I can see the door, I make sure I'm really tired when I fly, maybe a little cold, so the small space doesn't bother me as much and you turn the airway on. And now at this point I get a medication, Ativan that I take. 

01:12:05
REID WILSON And how much do you take and when you take it? 

01:12:10
MARY Well, that's always kinda tricky. Sometimes I get worried if I take it and then the flight spend delayed. Because I'm afraid it will wear off before we land and… 

01:12:20
REID WILSON You don't have a second one handy or… 

01:12:20
MARY Well, I do but then like usually I wanna do things when I landed and I don't wanna be really tired. 

01:12:30
REID WILSON Mm-hmm. 

01:12:30
MARY So it's just a matter of adjusting it. 

01:12:30
REID WILSON Yeah… yeah. Okay. 

01:12:35
MARY Yeah. 

01:12:35
REID WILSON So it sounds like flying… the flying issue is the biggest problem… 

01:12:40
MARY Uh… Well, the other problem that gets in the way is parking structures with their low ceilings. I feel like I'm gonna be crushed in there and if… especially if they're big and they're labyrinth or if the ramps get crowded, and if traffic's not moving. 

01:13:00
REID WILSON Mm-hmm. 

01:13:00
MARY And basically I don't park inside parking structures anymore and that's pretty hard because I can be driving around for a long time looking for parking on the street. 

01:13:10
REID WILSON Yeah, okay. Any other places, the elevators? 

01:13:15
MARY Well, elevators if they're slow and kinda clunky uh… or if too many people crowd on. But that if they're really modern and go fast and there's no one else in them I'm now too bad. 

01:13:30
REID WILSON And what's the slow clunky issue? 

01:13:35
MARY I think I'm afraid it's gonna get stuck. 

01:13:35
REID WILSON Well, I can have that, you know. You know, she said, you know, I'm a friend maybe she'll say it later and another one I don't think so, again I'm afraid I'm gonna the parking structure is gonna collapse and I think the worst possible death would be, you know, was being crushed to death. And said 'I hate that too,' so it rapport. It's getting rapport, come on, so. I said 'No, now we've been talking for a while. It's been 30 minutes and… and I'm asking what are, you know, what's going on with her point of view and she says 'Well, good. Well, I don't want it.' That's not the answer I want. I want what specifically is changing. So you listen to what has happened in her perspective already as we've just been like you and I had been talking. Okay, you've been listening and I've been talking, but still. You know, it's been like what we've been talking about, she's gotten that and it's coming up and what she's saying is these next two lines 'Some of my fears I have are unfounded'. Okay, we are great, that's what we're looking for. Get rid of the content. I can handle more than I think. I can handle in this moment. I don't know that she adds that in red, but I'm gonna add that for her. That is really what we wanna do is we wanna encourage these folks to step in and be more uncomfortable and more uncertain than they think they can tolerate in the moment. So how do you do that is you… you in the therapy sessions, we strategize, while you're thinking logically about what you wanna do and what's the smart thing to do, we design the practice for you together that you agree on and then when you go to do the practice, you act like an automaton, like a robot, like an actor in the drama just don't change the script because if you allow yourself to start changing the script and start analyzing, you know, what should I do right now, everything's gonna seem like a really bad idea, so that's what we're trying to lock in and you'll see whether she does that or not. So now this is what I… I have said to you already the two voices you're gonna hear that with her. Umm… And anyway you'll hear this. Notice the cloth… This is a scarf in my lap this is a scarf. She's gonna put around her neck and tighten it tighter than she thinks she can tolerate. You're not gonna get to see that. I'm sorry. But we do pillow cases overhead and eventually she agrees to have me put packing tape around her neck so she's feeling not only suffocation but restriction of movement. Now what you don't see on the video if you ever have this video is, actually the first time I put the packing tape around her, her numbers immediately went up and she said I'm… I'm an 85, I need you to take this off. So I said 'Okay, fine. I go to take it off.' I can't find the end of the tape. So I fumble around about it for awhile and then have I mentioned you're not gonna see this on the tape, then I stick my butt to the camera and take my teeth to her neck and tear that, so the piece when I do have it on tape where you… One would hear me say and I have folded back the tape and I can expertly… expertly take it off if necessary so. Okay, don't tell anybody that, all right. I have a reputation too. Is this being… umm… okay? Ya'll don't tell him either, okay? So we are doing things here short-term pain and long-term gain to give you a point of view to have on the plane. You're… The only the main thing we want change today and tomorrow morning is your point of view. Or and your interpretation. What kind of interpretation… What… What are we doing about your interpretation so far would you say? What direction do you sense that we're going in terms of modifying your? What would you say? 

01:17:50
MARY It's positive. 

01:17:50
REID WILSON Can you put it in words what would be a sentence or a message that would reflect the point of view. 

01:18:00
[sil.] 

01:18:10
MARY Well, just that uh… some of the fears I have are unfounded and that umm… I can tolerate more than I thought I could. 

01:18:25
REID WILSON If you… if you can have that one that's… that's the biggest one right there. I can handle, here's how it in part is gonna be I can handle more than I think I can at this moment. So it's almost like you have to have two voices inside yourself because your (inaudible) we're not getting rid of the symptoms. We're not getting rid of being scared. We're changing the interpretation of what you're scared about. I'm scared because I've been traumatized and every time you envision something going wrong, you get into trauma again, right. 

01:19:00
MARY Mm-hmm. 

01:19:00
REID WILSON So… so that's happening and I can handle it in the end. By tomorrow session how I want you to be thinking and you don't have to get this today is when you're feeling like you're suffocating or trapped, I am gonna suggest that you say two things. I want this feeling. What do you think about that one? 

01:19:30
MARY I was waiting for you to say to stop. 

01:19:35
REID WILSON I want this feeling. 

01:19:35
MARY Okay. 

01:19:40
REID WILSON And I can handle this feeling. So I can handle it we're trying to undo now to go wait a minute, you know, this isn't as bad as I think it is. There's plenty of air on this plane, right, so I can handle this. The thing you don't understand yet is I want this experience. What do you say now about it I want it to stop, right? 

01:20:00
MARY Right. 

01:20:00
REID WILSON So what're you think… How do you think your body reacts to the message this is a bad experience I wanted to stop. How does your body line up with that message? What do you think it that does to you? 

01:20:20
MARY Well, I think they probably heighten the anxieties. 

01:20:20
REID WILSON Really. Well, isn't that interesting. So could we extrapolate from that say so if I did the opposite of that and said I want this, I wouldn't secrete so much adrenaline because I'm going 'Wait, I'm just kidding,' no, I eat this for breakfast give me more of this, right. 

01:20:45
MARY Mm-hmm. 

01:20:45
REID WILSON Yeah, okay. But… but there it is you should assume the person sitting across from you is thinking what she just said 'I want this to stop' and then you wanna be thinking and saying to them 'Well, what's it do,' right to… to the body. How does the body will line up with that? Now we're gonna… now… So that's (inaudible) session one, we plan homework assignment. You're gonna hear about what she did. She goes, you know, what she's already said is that she doesn't do parking garages. Well, now she is gonna do a parking garage tonight and do this kind of practice so we're gonna hear what it's like after that so you're seeing the opening of session two which is the next morning. I only see her two sessions. Friday… Friday afternoon, Saturday morning, then Saturday afternoon she takes a flight. So (inaudible) let's get going, right. So umm… when the video starts, just notice how she looks because she's already begun to change. So she's gonna say some things (inaudible) should just say 'She is an impeccable student of the work. You're not gonna see someone like her. Do this in session after session one. Don't worry about the fact that this is just session two, just be thinking about something has happen and how can I help people get to this place. I'm old I've been doing this a lot. I can go a little more quickly, but don't worry about that part, right. You're gonna kinda off-camera or she's gonna say something about 'Unfortunately there was a lot of light coming through,' right. She's a good student of the work. She knows I need darkness that's my practice and I'm gonna, you know, at some point I go drat because she's not getting the symptoms too bad. She didn't get that kind of arousal. Umm… She's now, you know, this interesting little thing I want you to understand. People who are working on specific phobias like… like Mary is, then sometimes panic disorder they actually do need to reassure themselves for a while, right. This is not gonna collapse, there's enough air, that'll be okay, and that's a lot of, you know, reassurance is… is a crutch but we're… we're pushing the content away. Why? As you will see because she knows what she really wants to do is focus on this distress, right. And I don't wanna keep hearing that in my mind and having to work on that's not about that, it's about I'm looking to be uncomfortable and so that's what she's doing here. So we're gonna have detachment, it's not about this and then absorption. I wanna, you know, she's gonna say 'Well, I'm a teacher and so I wanna do what the teacher tells me because I compliment her on being a good student,' right. So absorption into the protocol is what we're looking for. And you'll hear her say go into the darkest place and, you know, it's… it's… it's a stunning piece of work and I looked out on her being the person I worked with. I of course have no skill. Oh, Good morning. 

01:24:10
MARY Good morning. 

01:24:10
REID WILSON How's the (inaudible)? 

01:24:10
MARY I'm all ready to go. 

01:24:15
REID WILSON Are you? 

01:24:15
MARY Yeah. 

01:24:15
REID WILSON Okay, so you stay in more than one night? 

01:24:15
MARY Two nights. 

01:24:20
REID WILSON Two nights, okay. 

01:24:20
MARY I can't… 

01:24:20
REID WILSON Looking forward to. 

01:24:20
MARY Yeah. 

01:24:20
REID WILSON Yeah, okay. Did you get a chance to practice the parking garage? 

01:24:25
MARY I did. I went to a parking garage in (inaudible) three stories and maybe unfortunately for the test it was sunset and there was a fair amount of light coming through. 

01:24:40
REID WILSON Mm-hmm. 

01:24:40
MARY But umm… but still the ceiling was quite low and it's one that… it's not the worst one but it's still one that I avoid normally. So I went in there and I really didn't feel quite as panicky as I usually do and I went into and so I went into the middle… 

01:25:05
REID WILSON (inaudible) why do you think you didn't feel as panicky because of the light or (inaudible) something else. 

01:25:10
MARY No, I think that really it already did helping in this session yesterday. I think… 

01:25:15
REID WILSON Is there a way to be specific about what… in what way it helped at that moment or did it help anticipating it as you were driving there or can you help frame it up a little bit for us? 

01:25:30
MARY Well, you know, I guess I had already thought about it quite a bit before I went there that I'm gonna go and I'm gonna do this. And I just kept running the logic through my mind like I think… 

01:25:50
REID WILSON So tell me about the logic? 

01:25:50
MARY It's not logical… It's not gonna collapse. There's plenty of air and yes the ceiling is low and you're not gonna like it, but it… it's gonna be fine and so what if you have to wait even if it's crowded because it was such a nice summer night I thought maybe their garage would be full, with you know, people wanting to be in town and… 

01:26:15
REID WILSON So you are saying the waiting is an issue is… 

01:26:15
MARY Well, the waiting is if you're on the ramp and you're waiting to get out and you're just sort of stuck there as people are trying to exit the garage. 

01:26:25
REID WILSON So (inaudible) what if you wait? 

01:26:25
MARY Right… right. It'll be fine. 

01:26:30
REID WILSON Meaning yeah, I can handle this. 

01:26:30
MARY Right. 

01:26:30
REID WILSON Okay. 

01:26:30
MARY Its not gonna be pleasant but there is enough air and I'm not gonna suffocate and so I just… 

01:26:45
REID WILSON (inaudible) great. 

01:26:45
MARY Telling myself those things, yeah, it was. 

01:26:45
REID WILSON (inaudible) so important to have a believable side of you that's kind of executive. 

01:26:50
MARY Mm-hmm. 

01:26:55
REID WILSON (inaudible) because there is another voice. 

01:26:55
MARY Right. 

01:26:55
REID WILSON We don't have to kill off that voice. We just have to put it in perspective, right. 

01:27:00
MARY Mm-hmm. 

01:27:00
REID WILSON There's a… there's a kind of a younger part of me, there's a traumatized part of me, there's a threatened, you know, part of me that's been injured and worries about that. And I can take care of her. I don't have to get rid of her. I can take her with me. But, you know, it's like the parent saying to the child, you know, you can stand behind my skirt and all. Really I mean something… something like that metaphorically. 

01:27:25
MARY Mm-hmm. Right. 

01:27:30
REID WILSON Okay and so once you were there you went to second floor or where did you go? 

01:27:35
MARY Umm… Well, I got a little confused so I actually went all the way up to the roof for a minute and then I went back uh… down to the next floor, the third floor. 

01:27:45
REID WILSON Mm-hmm. 

01:27:45
MARY And uh… then I went to the darkest place that I could find in there. And umm… I just… 

01:27:55
REID WILSON Why did you pick the darkest place? 

01:28:00
MARY Well, because I was trying to get that panicky part going umm… so that I can just stay with it for a few minutes. 

01:28:05
REID WILSON Because I when you left yesterday I was feeling like I didn't orient you enough to that kind of thing that she's gonna go and she's gonna play music and she's gonna distract herself… 

01:28:15
MARY No, actually I turn the radio off and I left the windows up, which I never do. 

01:28:20
REID WILSON Well, you're such a good student of the world, that's great. 

01:28:25
MARY Well, I'm a teacher so I guess, you know, I wanna do what the teacher says. 

01:28:30
REID WILSON Okay. 

01:28:30
MARY So and then there was still quite a bit of light coming through so I sort of well like this and just concentrated on there really low concrete ceiling and… 

01:28:45
REID WILSON And what you were noticing? What it… What about your numbers? Where how were they fluctuating? Anticipating it… 

01:28:50
MARY Well, the heart was… the heart was starting to go faster. 

01:28:55
REID WILSON Mm-hmm. On a scale of 0 to 100 where… where do you think it will range? 

01:29:00
MARY It was not really high. It was probably 50. 

01:29:00
REID WILSON Mm-hmm. Okay. 

01:29:00
MARY And it wasn't very crowded in there like I said and there was the light so umm… you know, but I just tried to make it as unpleasant as I could let that sit with that for a little bit. And I waited to… 

01:29:20
REID WILSON Let me just say if I had all my clients talk like you're talking in session two, my work would be so much easier, I mean, I'm fine doing hard work, but yes, you really… you really took to what I said and… and then went up another step that's… that's great news for you, so. 

01:29:40
MARY Yeah… yeah. 

01:29:40
REID WILSON The worst moment was there? There was it all pretty even or was there… 

01:29:50
MARY It was hardest when I blocked off the light with my hands and looked at the contrary that was quite low and heavy and… 

01:29:55
REID WILSON And how did you manage that… 

01:30:00
MARY And I just kept saying but it's not gonna collapse. It is right there and it's low but I'm a few minutes from the entrance and there's plenty of air in here and it's not gonna run out even if the cars were all exiting, it still wouldn't run out of air. There's enough permeation, permeability to the building and so forth. 

01:30:30
REID WILSON Right so she, you know, one of the things that and tomorrow if you are there I'll show you an OCD client, he says the same thing that she does which is she said 'On the way there I kept running the protocol through my mind, working on the logic, making sure I understood it.' She intuitively knew if she waited too long without being clear on what she was gonna do, she was gonna get into trouble. So she held it in her mind and then she kept going. If you… it's very subtle thing here and you didn't hear the other piece earlier, but what she said was 'The heart was starting to go faster.' She did it as a third person, she didn't say my heart. She detached from it, subtle little thing, but I think that's already a big change for her. I do compliment people all the time, this is very hard work and so she does good things 'I'm gonna say nice, great that you did that, keep doing that. So here's what I would say to… to you about working with people, one is, you know, as you get oriented and get them straight and so forth in the session you wanna be doing whatever you wanna be talking about in this session, so that by the end of the session you and they can collaborate around a practice that will get them to produce some degree of doubt and distress regarding their theme. I do not care about hierarchies. I do not work on hierarchies. I jump hierarchies all the time. We just figure out what we think they can do. I'm fine with somebody doing a small practice, the objective is am I feeling doubtful when I do it, am I feeling insecure in some way that's the work. You know, if somebody's doing something new with OCD and their hand washer, I'll say to them, you know, I don't, you know, if it gets too much, you just go wash your hands, I don't care if you wash your hands, I mean, most cognitive behavioral therapist don't talk about it like that, but what I want us to focus on is moment by moment. I certainly don't want them to go 'Okay, well, I'll just do this for a little bit because at any moment I can wash my hands, it'll be fine if I'm too much I can wash my hands because that's (inaudible) too much reassurance, but it's like this focus on being doubtful. So that's these questions here kind of the ways that one might help someone shape it up. How can I step in the scene and be somewhat anxious? How can I help myself tolerated? What way I can be uncertain? How can I tolerate that? That's what I wanna explore. Reminding you, three o'clock tomorrow if you wanna hear that talk. Umm… I should have put… Let me give you the website about the book and here's why umm… you can go on this website and download all the charts, all the tables, all the graphics that you were seeing part of them here, you can just download them for free. There's a setting color, there's a set in black and white. Umm… So you can get that. In three weeks, well, I've just finished filming the professional production company, two actors, six videos, five-minute videos that basically teach the essence of the book. And they will be posted there too and, you know, binge watching is helpful. Umm… You know, it's for your clients, you don't have to pay anything, you don't have to buy the book, nothing. You can just learn about that and… and it's clever, and it's funny, and well-written script and you'll see. So and then website is called noiseinyourhead.com. Again, you… I'm not trying to say go spend money on my book, you don't have to. Those two things are coming. So I am opening to questions now if you have a question come stand by the microphone and I'll answer if you are gonna scurry out of here instead just go quietly so people can hear what's going on. If you'll stand by the microphone then I'll answer your questions. You'll stand by the microphone, I'll answer your questions. The website noiseinyourhead.com. Thanks for coming have a great life you guys. Bye so. Yes, ma'am. 

01:35:30
UNKNOWN Okay. Yes, quick question on medicine. 

01:35:30
REID WILSON Say it again? 

01:35:30
UNKNOWN Quick question about medicine for anxiety? 

01:35:35
REID WILSON Okay. What is that? 

01:35:35
UNKNOWN Do you encourage or do you assess that medicine can be a helpful part of them working through their anxieties and if she wanted to take an Ativan to do her homework. How would you (inaudible) would you encourage her or not encouraged her to take her Ativan? 

01:35:50
REID WILSON Right, so again focus on… Don't go anywhere because you might have a follow-up question. So again I'm gonna focus on what do I need to do to make myself uncertain and uncomfortable. I don't care anything about medications. Almost everybody I see is on a medication, when they walk in the door. And I'm laissez-faire about getting off of medications. Do I recommend them taking a medication? No, I don't recommend anything I… regarding that. If they wanna take an Ativan? Fine. Uh… Is there a reason right? Crutches are useful that's wearing a boot on my foot, we… we need to use crutches sometimes what's the function of a crutch? It is so I can take a large step forward. If my client has alone in six years and she has to fly to London in three weeks, I'm gonna ask them to go get a benzodiazepine and if they are wealthy person they gonna upgraded to first class and see if they can bring somebody with them and so forth because that's a huge step. This kid I don't wanna go start flying next week because he's not ready and I don't wanna him a huge step back and then, you know, whatever. What I will say to them a few things I'll say about it. One is the benzodiazepines put the amygdala to sleep. So you cannot really habituate on a benzodiazepine, something to know about that. Umm… On the… on the flip side benzodiazepines have a great… can do a great service to us. It's ridiculous to get on SSRI for fear of flying when you only fly every four or five weeks or so. And then our work requires breakthrough symptoms and after a while if you're on a medication, medications gonna have a governor on your symptoms and you're not gonna have symptoms anymore. And then you decide to stop treatment with me and that's fine or taper down on your medications in order to have breakthrough symptoms. How's that answer? Okay, with you. 

01:37:50
UNKNOWN That's fine. Thank you. 

01:37:55
REID WILSON Okay. Yes. Yes, ma'am. 

01:37:55
UNKNOWN Hi! 

01:37:55
REID WILSON Hi! 

01:37:55
UNKNOWN I'm just wondering what other skill set you believe in using other than self talk, when you're sitting with the patient who's so afraid of experiencing those feelings that they're gonna have to live through, you know, and be able uh… to experience in that interim before they can. Because I just see so many patients in their anticipation of how they're gonna feel, you know, in the moment just or get stuck and what to do? 

01:38:25
REID WILSON Yeah, well, that would probably require a long answer for you around that because there's lots of different, I mean, angles to what you're saying. Let me just take the kid I was talking to you about… about who's having panic attacks. I'm… If they don't wanna, you know, if he did have one of these symptoms that he's freaked out I'm just gonna say let's take one deep breath and exhale, see how that goes. Let's, you know, interoceptive exposure is a wonderful tool and if you don't know a lot about it, I have a little booklet that umm… the Anxiety and Depression Association cell is called facing panic and it has a whole chapter on interoceptive exposure. You can email me I'll send you the handout that talks about that. But that's we're looking for in the little things that they could do. If they got OCD and are around contamination, if I can bring them into the bathroom with me and do some little thing, I… this is persuasive therapy. 

01:39:20
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:39:20
REID WILSON Part of it is, you know, even though my mind's gonna be racing what am I gonna do with a client who doesn't wanna do anything at all? I'm gonna sit back in my chair, you know, I must say 'Look at, the world can get by without you changing, I mean, you don't (inaudible) the world doesn't care whether you fly again or not umm… if you would like to, you know, (inaudible) find out is this stuff in your way out and (inaudible) you know, that's the angle I'm gonna take which is I think people would try to start doing this stuff and have done it for a while you feel too much pressure about changing people and it's better to sit back as a way to change them as opposed to lean forward. You know, people come into supervision and say well, you know, I said this that and that and… and they wouldn't do those and so I need some more ideas, some other tricks I know I'm not (inaudible) give more tricks, you know, once we start working harder than the clients we're lost so and then we have to look at secondary gain. 

01:40:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:40:30
REID WILSON And then lastly I would say 'If they don't do anything with you, I would just back up, do some psychodynamic stuff, just keep building rapport, there's something going on the character perhaps. You know how to do that, right. 

01:40:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:40:45
REID WILSON So go just… just back up and (inaudible) keep coming forward to the question. How did I do? 

01:40:50
UNKNOWN Fine, thank you. 

01:40:50
REID WILSON Okay. 

01:40:50
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:40:50
REID WILSON You're very generous to allow me to not have to keep explaining them. 

01:40:55
UNKNOWN My question is in kind of in reference to comorbidity. 

01:41:00
REID WILSON We're gonna have to speak up a little bit because… 

01:41:00
UNKNOWN My question is kind of in reference to comorbidity uh… that I want to punch anxiety depression. I noticed when you talk about stepping forward which seems like one of the (inaudible) pieces to this. I… I found at least in my experience when working with anxious depressed people like that stepping forwards to the hardest part saying 'I can handle it' umm… and I was curious to hear what you had to say about that because that's the impact (inaudible) like the piece before that saying I want a lot of depressed people or kind of masochistic in certainly so I can see how that would propel them forward, but actually… 

01:41:35
REID WILSON Okay. I'll I tend to think about it, but yes. Okay. 

01:41:35
UNKNOWN But actually stepping forward and… and saying 'I can handle it' as always seemed to be the most problematic at least in my practice so far (inaudible). 

01:41:40
REID WILSON Okay, yeah. Again a wonderful question there's a very complex question. It would be hard for me to give you as much as I would like to at this particular moment. One is, you know, we just did a published study on the Today Treatment Group with OCD and… and all the measures, of all 16 measures changed in… in the day after they were (inaudible) the treatment group and then a month later including the Beck Depression Inventory significantly change and we didn't even dress depression, but what we got our self-efficacy, right. Because the depressive triad is, you know, the world's put too much pressure on me, I don't have what it takes and tomorrow's gonna be just like yesterday. And so because we do this cognitive stuff and then I cannot (inaudible) you know, sweep them up and get them to start doing a practice, they do a practice at lunchtime and suddenly they go 'Oh, wow! I had no idea I could do that' maybe tomorrow will be different than yesterday. I had a woman with social anxiety again with writing shaky hands as part of it. (inaudible) one session, I put her in my biweekly group immediately and at the end of the first session I said 'Would you be willing to do an experiment' and… and she said, you know, what are they gonna say she said uh… 'Sure.' And so I had her sit on the floor, I gave her my 8.5 x 11 pad. I had the eight of us stand around her and then I asked her if she would sign her name all the way down to columns, so what 44 times, right. Umm… And she did that and of course, you know, at first the hand writing really… really shaky. How do you think the handwriting looked when she was signing her 40th time, you know, it was just (inaudible) right. So in less than ten minutes, she made 180 degree turn. My first session in group doing the highest issue on my list, I was able to do with everybody's standing over me, so we're… we're looking for even little things that kind of breakthrough what you're asking for and I… and I get, you know, depression is the number one comorbid disorder that comes with anxiety. You have a follow-up question around. 

01:44:00
UNKNOWN No, I think that's good. 

01:44:00
REID WILSON Am I doing okay? 

01:44:00
UNKNOWN I guess what I hear from that is in your experience having them be more active doing in vivo and desensitization sort of things umm… has been helpful in regards to overcoming that… that hurdle. 

01:44:10
REID WILSON Okay, but you're… you're talking and everyone's hearing you, but me because I don't have a speaker, so… 

01:44:15
UNKNOWN I guess what I've heard from you in response is that you feel that doing in vivo and sort of desensitization… 

01:44:20
REID WILSON Yeah… yeah, a little experiment. 

01:44:20
UNKNOWN Right, thank you then. 

01:44:20
REID WILSON Little things, would you be willing… would you be willing. Could we just try this, let's see how this goes. Yeah, over now. 

01:44:30
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:44:30
REID WILSON Right. So and then what I said to the last one which is also sit back. Don't give up but, you know, sit back a little bit. Yes, sir, just remember I can't hear very well. 

01:44:40
UNKNOWN So Dr. Wilson, you're talk about I guess you have some materials that about accelerated treatment I think I read an article of yours. I've learned over time to accelerate the treatment. Well, about how long would that be in your, you know, for a lot of clients? 

01:44:50
REID WILSON Accelerating treatment? 

01:44:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:44:55
REID WILSON Why do you ask? 

01:44:55
UNKNOWN I don't know. I guess… I guess I'm thinking in terms of the model once a person is willing to tolerate something that might be very uncomfortable, I mean, at that point isn't it kind of like a lot of the work is done because that part that says I'm gonna step up, it's gonna step up, you know, what I mean. 

01:45:15
REID WILSON Yeah. Well, the reason I reverse the question to you is, I mean, I wouldn't worry about how long it takes, but what your (inaudible) right let's get a model in place. I got somebody my clients I've been seeing for 17 years. 

01:45:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:45:25
REID WILSON I've got two or three more people that have been seen less than that but more than a decade. So there are people who have personality traits that are, you know, anxious and insecure, and we just, we work on a variety of things but once you get the (inaudible) I would say keep the protocol incredibly simple just a few things that you're focused on and you will have to do it again and… again and again. Don't let them get you to think complexly, think simply so I think you're right you get that when going and then you go 'Well, let's start working on the stuff that you're avoiding and let's keep going,' right. With OCD, you know, a lot of… some of them will go 'Okay, well, I'll handle all these things' but this thing around, you know, see in spots on the towels and (inaudible) do have to cycle it through about three times in the washer. So but I'm alright with that or (inaudible) with ordering, we really do wanna handle everything around OCD for the most part. The other anxiety disorders if they got some things on the list they don't wanna do, that's okay, you know, work with parents for the kid who's sleeping with them because she's too afraid. You know, some parents will say 'Well, now you know, I just put a chair outsider room and I sit there for a half hour and then she goes to sleep' and that's good enough for me and then they were finished with therapy, so it really depends on how much they wanna complete on their hierarchy. You have a follow up around. 

01:46:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, I get that thank you. 

01:46:55
REID WILSON Okay. You're welcome. You understand about speaking up but I'm not deaf, I don't have speakers, so. 

01:47:05
UNKNOWN Right. So the two… the two case studies… 

01:47:10
REID WILSON Yeah. 

01:47:10
UNKNOWN It seem to be there a little bit different. The first one what I got was that being her anxiety her worries were more about how she was feeling insecure about (inaudible). So do you look for that as well in Mary like what is it that she okay. 

01:47:35
REID WILSON No, I don't look. I only know umm… you know, again I looked (inaudible) sorry to say lucked out, you know, the first woman, Barbara revealed really quickly I'm gonna jump all over that like white on rice. Was that an expression. 

01:47:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:47:50
REID WILSON Yeah. Okay, well, I did that, right. And it just… I just found it and you just look for things like that, that are hooks. I wouldn't necessarily look for insecurity all the time for everybody because it's just not Mary didn't need that. Mary did (inaudible) it's interesting just as an aside. We… I… she said (inaudible) suffocation on the plane and I said 'Oh, yeah, I've read all those articles in the paper about a plane stuck on the tarmac and everybody in the plane suffocating and dying and before I've even finished, she's laughing. I said you're laughing, what do you laugh? She (inaudible). Well, you know, all the stuff that we did when she wrote me on… on Tuesday about how the fly went. She said that 'When she started having some trouble that little joke is what popped in her mind, you know, and that's what jokes are about, right, like changing perspective like that. So it's interesting you don't quite know what's gonna do it for them. So that's my long answer. You have follow-up from that? 

01:48:55
UNKNOWN So the difference just being that hers was the phobia, was that or… 

01:49:05
REID WILSON No, just didn't show up there around (inaudible). Mary had plenty of stuff to do with Mary. The insecurity stuff didn't show up. It showed up immediately with Barbara. It makes sense to me and so yeah. Now thank you for that question. But (inaudible) the other reason she's asking that is because I was really emphasizing the insecurity that comes up inside us or the shame that comes up inside us or… or the embarrassment that comes up inside us and… and that was what I was saying early on in the talk around, let's go for that. I'm willing to have this feeling, I can tolerate this feeling, its okay that this is here. Specially this example around social anxiety, they miss this totally. And if we don't pay attention to it, the work is very slow with social anxiety. It moves along a little better when you start bringing attention here. I'm looking to feel insecure, right. So… so because it's a social thing, right. Yes, ma'am. 

01:50:10
UNKNOWN Just this is kind of theoretical I… I came in a little late so maybe you already covered this but you say… 

01:50:15
REID WILSON I did, but you can ask me anyway there's not that many people here… 

01:50:15
UNKNOWN Okay. It's just all about me. I just, you know… 

01:50:15
REID WILSON Yeah, that's it. 

01:50:15
UNKNOWN So umm… you said if they have anxiety, they've had trauma. Do you believe that 100% there's always anxiety… there's always trauma? 

01:50:25
REID WILSON Oh, yeah, 100%, but that's a generic definition of trauma, which means I've got in a situation and I freaked out and didn't know how to handle it, you know, the kid has a panic attack that's a trauma. 

01:50:40
UNKNOWN Oh, all right, that's it. 

01:50:40
REID WILSON Somebody gets embarrassed (inaudible) they're trying to think of their words and somebody laughs at them, you know, I've got trauma I can go back to eighth grade and turn red in the face right now telling you about it, even mentioned it, so I'm just talking about trauma meaning something big happened and I got really small and couldn't handle it and now I'm afraid, and I don't want that to happen anymore and I need your help. That's how I mean if there's an exception you're thinking now go ahead and tell me. 

01:51:15
UNKNOWN No, actually what I've been wondering about and I don't know if you, I mean, I've worked with teenagers for 25 years and in the last five, six, seven years I've seen such an exponential explosion and anxiety, and I'm like 'Where they heck!' You know, so I don't have a clue what, you know, I'm thinking are they more traumatized, why? I don't know. (inaudible) does don't have any answers to that question. I'm curious. 

01:51:35
REID WILSON Yeah, well, they can talk to you afterwards and see maybe they have some answers. (inaudible) I haven't seen the statistics that indicates that so much, but its great news that they're showing up in your office. 

01:51:50
UNKNOWN Yeah… yeah… yeah. 

01:51:50
REID WILSON That's important, you know, coming from that in my own childhood its like the worst thing in the world is we're going through something and no one knows about it and you can't tell anybody and even people who know about it don't do anything about it, so it's wonderful that they're coming. That's my response to this, it wonderful that you're seeing them. 

01:52:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible) they're coming in (inaudible). 

01:52:10
REID WILSON Yeah, congratulations to them to have a system that allows them to come to you. So I'll do one more question and then we'll stop, even though we have an extra minute. 

01:52:20
UNKNOWN Actually I've two questions? 

01:52:20
REID WILSON Okay. 

01:52:25
UNKNOWN One is with Mary it seemed like she was an incredibly resourceful person to begin with. She is a teacher, she readily grasped everything you were saying and she just went with it very intelligent. It seems like most of the people that you've been worked out aren't (inaudible) aren't quite as resourceful as her. 

01:52:40
REID WILSON Yeah, so… so… 

01:52:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:52:45
REID WILSON I said… I said that to be, you know, that she's an exception to the rule, but she allows me to present you the model cleanly, you know, I've got a video called the treatment of the reluctant OCD client and that's I hate that tape, I mean, it's boring and I have to go over the same thing over and over again and drill her and question her and things so. Yeah, so if your question is what do you do with somebody who is terribly resistant 'Thank God! We're running out of time and I can't answer that. There's a second question. 

01:53:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, can you explain what you do with the interoceptive exposure (inaudible) that you were talking about? 

01:53:25
REID WILSON Uh… Interoceptive exposure? What do I do what does that mean or what do I do? 

01:53:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, what do you… what are your manifests for doing that? 

01:53:30
REID WILSON Well, did you know what is it in general? 

01:53:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:53:35
REID WILSON Okay, well, I'm gonna use interoceptive exposure, exposure of bodily sensations that would be spinning in a chair, breathing through a cocktail straw, umm… her doing the clusterphobic stuff, you know, there's a whole list of things that we do the hyperventilation, all of that is there. My emphasis is not straightforward interoceptive exposure, it is to do that in order to work on the belief system. So with Mary, I… we work on that and, you know, she's able to have the (inaudible) 'Oh, she's doing I've got swimmers plug on her nose and she's breathing through a cocktail… single cocktail straw and she does it for ten seconds and does fine. Then we're gonna do the next one and I say is gonna be for 30 seconds and she starts and after eight seconds she's pulling that off and, you know, pull it off and… and I said 'What happened?' She said 'Well, I… I thought I was suffocating,' Oh, were you, well, if you felt like it did and then we talked about a little bit and I said well, maybe it was that I said 'You were gonna do it for 30 seconds,' Mary knows something about that (inaudible) she said well maybe yeah, I said 'Well, let's try it again if you're willing and we'll just do 10 seconds, if you can 15, we'll do 15 seconds. I mean, if you can get to 30 seconds that would be great, but I'll just let you know and you can stop whenever you want. And then she did and she got all the way to 30 seconds and then we stopped and I go 'How did you do that? How did you… How did you do that just three minutes ago, you couldn't do eight seconds, nothing changed and suddenly you did it for 30 seconds, how did you do that, right? And she said 'Well, I, you know, I think I said I thought I had enough air or whatever. And so that's how I do it as I go in typical interoceptive exposure that I was doing with the young guy with the fear of flying is just hyperventilate and just hang out and do nothing, and notice everything subsides. That's the traditional way to do it. With… with Mary and others I tend to do with the example I just gave you. We have to stop because it's been two hours. Thanks for showing up. Have a great life.
